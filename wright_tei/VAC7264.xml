               <p>THE Albergo Della Poste of Faenza is not an inviting hostelry. So thought a young
                  American, as on a December evening he sat shivering in one of its dreary chambers.
                  The floor was of brick, with only a little rag of carpet before the fireplace. The
                  fuel provided was either of light grape-vine twigs which flashed up furiously and
                  then fell into white ashes, or else of monstrous green logs which would not
                  kindle. There was an inch of space between the door and its groundsill, through
                  which the air streamed in dolefully. Dinner was just over; there stood a bottle of
                  thin, sour wine upon the table, a paper of rank, weedy-looking cigars, and a few
                  books lay beside. A huge, battered travelling-trunk was standing near the bed,
                  upon whose canvas-covering were marked the letters B. M. It was about six o'clock,
                  and the dusk had fairly set in. Upon these slender resources and his own thoughts
                  the traveller was depending to "make a night of it," at least till toward
                  midnight. It was not a very cheerful prospect. The young man lit a cigar, threw a
                  handful of twigs upon the coals, and coaxed the dryest-looking log forward into
                  the blaze. "Very like these Italians," said he to himself, "are their fires. All
                  flash and white heat at first with the revolutionary elements; but the solid,
                  conservative institutions, the nobility and the peasantry and the clergy won't
                  catch, and a few ashes are all that is left."</p>
               <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7264-00000004"/>
               <p>This was said neither cynically or despondingly, but with a semi-complacent air,
                  as though the speaker thought he had made a good hit. Italy and the Italians were
                  nothing to him except to be looked at. He looked round at his table and took up
                  his journal, made an entry or two in the book,—a simple pocket diary,—laid it
                  down, seized a French guide-book, and glanced over a couple of pages, making
                  pencilled notes upon its margin, then turned rapidly over the leaves of a
                  catalogue of the Academia dei Belli Arti at Bologna, underscoring here and there
                  the title of a picture, and then pushed both away from him with the air of a man
                  who finishes his work. Up to this time he had moved rapidly and decidedly, like
                  one who knows his object, but this over, he sat with Kingsley's "Yeast" in his
                  hand, half open, dreamily looking into the fire. He tried to read a few lines,
                  then flung down the book with an impatient air, and took up, as a <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">dernier resort,</foreign> a small pocket-Bible.</p>
               <p>"I should like to read that book!" he ejaculated. "Not, of course, for anything in
                  particular, but as a Hebrew history. It has certainly curious things in it. If
                  Jepthah now was called Agamemnon and his daughter Iphigenia, I suppose we should
                  think it poetry and passion and all that; but being it is the Book of Judges, we
                  read it very solemnly to little children Sunday afternoons to keep them still. By
                  Jove! I do think it is the same story,—the legend localized, of course, by Greek
                  and Hebrew. Which had it first? The Greek came from Egypt, so did the Hebrew.
                  Wherefore the Nile is the Father not only of Egypt but of legends. Where, I
                  wonder, is the original home of the myth? Isn't it, after all, allegory,—nature
                  and all that sort of thing,—Zeus and Here the creative and receptive forces, and
                  the wisdom of the mummies generally? Only I wish I could shake off the spell of
                  childhood and read this book instead of staring at it, or thinking of the dollar I
                  am to have when I read it through. I thought I had put the Atlantic well between
                  me and my childhood—and yet——." He fell to reading again, and perhaps by dint of
                  severer effort, perhaps by the help of the train of classical analogies he had
                  invoked and hoped to discover, he succeeded in becoming so absorbed in his reading
                  as not to notice the sound of a carriage rumbling through the archway under his
                  room, nor, half an hour after, the noise of footsteps in the passage-way. There
                  came a rap at the door, and at his reply the Cameriere entered, bringing a basket
                  of wood, and uttering a profusion of voluble Italian, of which "Americano" was the
                  only word our hero understood. He tried to frame an answer, half drew out his
                  passport, caught up his phrase-book, stammered, and finally broke down altogether,
                  taking refuge in the only familiar phrase. "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">Non capisco
                     ninte.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Then it is time I took care of myself," said a cheerful voice, and a tall
                  gentlemanly-looking man advanced into the room. "I'm quite alone, <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> to Bologna, and finding that I've a
                  countryman in the same scrape as myself, I have come to propose that we join
                  forces."</p>
               <p>"Delighted to see you, I'm sure—have you dined? Kellner—Garon—Cam—what's your
                  name?" was the young man's reply; but that functionary had gone.</p>
               <p>"I took the liberty of giving him his directions beforehand, and if you will
                  permit me. to contribute a little from my own stock of creature comforts we shall
                  do better? than by drawing on the resources of the Delia Poste."</p>
               <p>"My name is Gardiner. You shall tell me yours by and by, if you think best."</p>
               <p>The stranger threw himself into a chair, and stretched out his feet to the now
                  blazing fire, drew from his pocket a cigar-case, offered its contents to his host,
                  lighted another for himself, and a pleased look of comfort came over his handsome
                  features. He was a tall man, large framed, and slightly stooping, the head
                  beginning to be bald a little. The whiskers trimmed in the English fashion. He
                  wore spectacles, his hands were white and very handsome, his mouth showed great
                  firmness, and his forehead was high and ample. He glanced at the table, and,
                  catching sight of the opened Bible laid face downward, a graver look came over his
                  face.</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon," he said; "I hope I have not trespassed. You were not
                  preparing for bed, were you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, not at all. Why did you—oh, I see," replied the younger man. "No, I was
                  not reading—that is, I was. I was reading simply for occupation. You interrupted
                  nothing. I shall not go to bed these three hours or more. I am very glad you have
                  come in, indeed."</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7264-00000005"/>
               <p>There came another knock at the door, and the Cameriere reappeared with a small
                  travelling-case, from which the new-comer speedily produced a flask—straw-covered
                  and inviting-looking.</p>
               <p>"I have taken the liberty," he said, "of bringing you some of the vino di Capri to
                  try. It is direct from Naples, You have not been there yet?"</p>
               <p>"No, I am on my way to Rome. I left Bologna this morning."</p>
               <p>"Ah—where did you stop? At the Svizzer, I suppose? Were there any Americans
                  there—a tall, elderly lady and two young ones?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir; only English, and the officers of an Austrian regiment. Stop—I believe a
                  party came in last night, and one of the ladies was tall. I passed them on the
                  stairs, and heard her say, 'My son promised to meet me here;' but more I can't
                  tell you."</p>
               <p>"That is enough," said the elder. "I was delayed at Ancona, by this passport
                  nuisance, out to see the Santa Casa at Loretto. What an absurdity it is to suppose
                  that a house should fly through the air from Palestine to Italy, and yet Romanism
                  insists upon this as one of her miracles."</p>
               <p>"Do you really suppose, sir, educated Catholics believe any such things? I
                  supposed that we had got nearly to the end of holding the miracles as a ground of
                  belief, and after all, one miracle is about as hard to believe as another."</p>
               <p>"But you were reading the Bible when I came in. What do you hold that to be?"</p>
               <p>"I hardly know, sir. I was brought up to believe I ought to read it; I never was
                  told why, and so I never did read it. I used to hear a chapter at morning and
                  night read at school and college, and a little now and then on Sundays. I believed
                  till I was ten or twelve that the Old Testament was sent down to Moses on Mount
                  Sinai, and the New I supposed came in some equally marvellous way. Then I was told
                  that Paley was unanswerable to prove the miracles, but Paley's arguments did not
                  seem to me to answer Strauss or Theodore Parker. So I went to my teachers, who
                  assured me that the Sermon on the Mount proved its own divinity; and again, Mr.
                  Emerson made me think something very like that was to be found in the Hindoo and
                  Persian. I was told that there must be five original races, and that being so, I
                  can't see that Genesis is to be taken very literally. I rather incline, just now,
                  to the notion that it is the allegorical principle of good and evil, as the Hebrew
                  mind shaped it, which is told in the story of Adam and Eve. The feminine part of
                  the soul's nature, the appetite, the will, the desire, covets knowledge; the
                  reason, the calculating, manly, element, yields, and with knowledge comes of
                  course sorrow,—since only through knowledge and sorrow can be progress. However, I
                  am all afloat, I confess. I was looking just now at the coincidences between the
                  Hebrew and Greek legends, and trying to put them exactly on the same level. I left
                  as many prejudices as I could at the Custom-house of Rotterdam, but I find old
                  associations too strong; and yet I cannot see why Samson and Hercules should not
                  be equally legendary, or why the battles under Troy's walls are not quite as real
                  as those before Jericho."</p>
               <p>"Where were you educated, sir?" broke in the elder.</p>
               <p>"Old Harvard," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"So I supposed," said Gardiner. "Old Harvard, being younger probably than the
                  youngest building in these streets, has the right to walk roughshod over the
                  truths of the past. I myself had a little of the Harvard training, and know
                  something of its teachings. I don't much wonder at your present difficulties. Have
                  you any objection to believing?"</p>
               <p>"I was brought up to hate and despise New England Calvinism, and to suppose that
                  my common sense was my own, and not to be the slave of impossible propositions. I
                  have an objection to believing in predestination, for that seems to me to settle
                  all need of belief."</p>
               <p>"Well, we will let Calvin and Arminius go for the present—let us dispose of
                  Genesis. Are you entirely committed to the five-race theory?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all; I have no other objections than Behring's Straits, and they never
                  seemed to me insuperable."</p>
               <p>"Are you willing, then, to concede that Genesis may be true?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly—only I can make very little sense of it; a wild legendary book,
                  fragmentary, minute in detail, and vast in outline, breaking into startling
                  episodes, such as the Deluge, the fall of Sodom, the dispersion of Babel, and the
                  sacrifice of Isaac. I never could—pardon me, if I shock<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000006"/> you—I never could receive that for anything but a
                  myth. The divine command could not require anything so awful to test a man's
                  faith. No, I do not feel willing that Genesis be taken except as an allegory."</p>
               <p>"I hardly know where to begin with you. I suppose you will accept a Creative
                  Spirit?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly—Bonaparte's reply to the savans always seemed to me conclusive—'Very
                  well, Messieurs—but who made all that?"</p>
               <p>"And you don't object to man as a part of His scheme?"</p>
               <p>"No, of course not."</p>
               <p>"And He made man sinful?"</p>
               <p>"Why no, I suppose not—that is hardly consistent with my idea of the Creator."</p>
               <p>"Then man is innocent now?"</p>
               <p>"There is the difficulty, sir. I have rather taken up the theory that there is no
                  such thing as sin, that it is only the conflicting elements of man's nature
                  working out of harmony in his efforts after the highest good: that is, what is sin
                  in one man is only the abandoned virtue of a lower stage. Duelling, for instance,
                  becomes murder as we grow civilized."</p>
               <p>"And are there no sins which are always sin independent of society?"</p>
               <p>The young man got up from his chair and paced the room hastily once or twice,
                  looked at his companion, then his eyes fell.</p>
               <p>"Well, I give up that point," said he; "yes, I know that sin is a reality, and
                  theories are just so much bravado and whistling in the dark. I suppose—I'm—like
                  what most young men are; and if I had any doubt about myself, I've seen one or two
                  cold-blooded things which about, settle the question. Yes, sin has got into
                  man—somehow—but that story of the apple and the serpent is hardly anything but a
                  fable."</p>
               <p>"Let us leave the serpent—though I should like to have you explain the universal
                  hatred of mankind for the serpent race—let us leave him for the present and keep
                  to what you call the apple—a word you won't find in the Mosaic account, by the
                  way. What were the three things which tempted Eve? It was good for food, pleasant
                  to the eyes, and to be desired to make one wise. Now here are the three
                  representative qualities which the Church in her baptismal covenant describes as
                  the world, the flesh, and the devil: that is, the bodily appetite, innocent in
                  itself, except for the prohibition; the pleasure of the eyes, that is, the
                  intellectual faculty, the perceptive powers; and the moral element, the soul's
                  craving for power. Now turn to the New Testament to St. Luke's gospel-account of
                  the temptation. What is there addressed to our Blessed Lord? The temptation of the
                  bodily appetite, to make the stones bread; of the intellect, as involved in
                  worldly dominion; and of the soul, in the casting Himself down from the pinnacle
                  of the Temple in order to save Himself by Divine power. He is in this last to
                  sacrifice Himself in appearance to win the popular belief. The sin is not that He
                  who made the five loaves feed the multitude should make the stones bread, nor that
                  the Messiah-King of the whole earth should possess the world's kingdoms, nor that
                  He who was lifted up to be the great High Priest of the earth should offer His
                  life for the people. The sin was in transgressing God's command and losing the
                  subjecting power of His own will. Now see how exactly that corresponds to Adam's
                  temptation, or rather to Eve's."</p>
               <p>"I see," said the young man thoughtfully; "I see there is more in it than I
                  fancied. But what of that which follows? God inflicts death as the penalty for a
                  single sin: is not that hard?"</p>
               <p>"No, it is consequence—merciful consequence. You say you left your prejudices at
                  Rotterdam—but how about your New England Harvard prejudice in favor of the
                  sanctity of human life? Is death never a blessing?"</p>
               <p>"I confess I never thought it so. I read Bulwer's 'Zanoni' in College, and I
                  longed for Mejnour's power of indefinite living. Life is so short and so
                  glorious."</p>
               <p>Gardiner smiled sadly, and then said: "Death is an ultimate fact for humanity at
                  any rate—apart from revelation; but how could Adam live for ever, having yielded
                  to his animal nature and let it get dominion over him? He had become animal—the
                  appetite sought for the appetite's sake. An immortality of drunkenness would be an
                  immortality of misery, a progressive degradation. Even Zanoni and<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000007"/> Mejnour, if I remember, won their right to live by
                  conquering the body's desires."</p>
               <p>"Yes, you are right; and I see too that temptation to an innocent being must have
                  been external. I never thought of that. But why was not Adam forgiven and
                  restored? God is surely sufficient for that."</p>
               <p>"You must remember that man was created in the image of his Maker, and therefore a
                  free agent. Restoration could only be by enabling him to recover his lost
                  self-possession. He had accepted the dominion of an evil power, for, as you say,
                  the temptation must have been external. Now that is given in hope. Eve is promised
                  that from her seed shall come the Deliverer. And the first institution for
                  fulfilling that promise is one which directly meets the animal tendency—the
                  institution of the family. Take Genesis, and you will find it the record of family
                  life. There is a priesthood of the first-born. Cain offers an unworthy
                  offering—not sacrifice—but purchase. He gives the fruits of the ground. God's
                  bounty he claims as his own possession. Abel's offering is sacrifice, the shedding
                  of blood—according to appointed type of a death to come. Death which ends the
                  dominion of the flesh, the world, and Satan, is to be the gate of life. This world
                  has been unparadised to man by his own sin. God gives him the hope of a new and
                  better one. What is the historic fact of all primal and savage races? They are
                  families, tribes, clans: the head is the born head and King and Patriarch. God, in
                  the calling of Abraham, developes the state. The Jewish theocracy introduces a new
                  order into the world. The Asian system, which in India and China still exists, is
                  based upon the family. The European, upon the national life. The American, with
                  its Democratic theories, is the beginning of the Church. These three
                  institutions—Family, State, and Church—are God's divine appointment correspondent
                  to the physical, intellectual, and spiritual elements in man to work out his
                  restoration."</p>
               <p>"That I like; it seems to me grand: but how does the Mediatorship of Jesus come
                  in?"</p>
               <p>"When you come to understand the Church you will see. But in the first place what
                  was man's offence in essence? Disobedience: now, to renew the race, it was
                  necesssry that it be obedient, and to that the obedience of a Federal head was
                  necessary. The Church is the Church of Christ. It is His humanity possessing the
                  race. Its condition is unity with Him and in Him."</p>
               <p>"You get beyond me there, sir. I have no idea of a Church beyond that of a
                  worshipping assembly, and I must say I think the private, personal devotion much
                  better than most of the worship I see; and yet——Last summer I was in Munich. I
                  strayed into the Pfarrer Kirche—the new one. There was no one there but a peasant
                  woman and her little one. She knelt down with the child in her arms, put its
                  little hands together, and made it repeat after her a prayer. It brought the tears
                  into my eyes, and I would have given anything for her faith and some one to lead
                  me as a little child into some sort of belief and desire of prayer."</p>
               <p>"Have you ever attended the Church services—I mean the Episcopal Church?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, now and then, and they always pleased me: but I couldn't find the places;
                  and then there seemed so little reality about them, and the sermons were so flat
                  and flimsy—pious homilies about Joseph and his brethren, like good little
                  story-books. I tried hard to be a zealous Unitarian, but you see it has led me
                  into questioning everything. Only I know,"—and here he broke out into startling
                  energy—"I know the Saviour's teachings are true—the Sermon on the Mount: the rest
                  is all Jewish to me. I can't comprehend it. I was very eager in reform movements
                  at home, but they were all so one-sided and full of 'the' cause. The Abolitionists
                  were so terribly bitter, and the Temperance men so narrow and ignorant, and the
                  Socialists—I hung by them a good while—simple, impracticable. Living in
                  phalansteries did not reform the world, as by the most able demonstration it
                  should. One-half would try to speculate on the other half. I thought it best to
                  come away and see Europe. The world suited me very well I had enough to live on in
                  it, and the rest was all visionary. I suppose I have turned Epicurean—but why
                  not?"</p>
               <p>"If the dead rise not, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die," said Gardiner,
                  quietly.</p>
               <p>They sat silently for a few moments, and then the young man in resumed: "I wish I
                  could see more of you, sir; you<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7264-00000008"/> seem to
                  have clear views at least; perhaps you could teach me. May I ask your route?"</p>
               <p>"I am going on, to Bologna, to-morrow, to meet my mother and some young friends
                  with her; and then we intend, if nothing happens to turn us back, to spend a part
                  of the winter in Rome—at least to be there during the Christmas season."</p>
               <p>"I go to Rome to-morrow; we may meet."</p>
               <p>"I hope so," said Gardiner.</p>
               <p>"I suppose we all bank at Prince Torlonia's, and there we can learn each other's
                  address." The young man drew from his diary a card and handed it to the visitor:
                  upon it was simply printed, in old English black-letter, the name, BRYAN
                  MAURICE.</p>
               <p>"And now," said Gardiner, "before we part, do me one favor. I am orders, and as we
                  are strangers in a strange land together we ought to remember who it is by whose
                  care we are guided. Will you share my worship, even though I trespass upon your
                  Unitarian ideas little?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said Maurice; and without farther speech Gardiner took up the
                  pocket-Bible and read the first chapter of St. John's Gospel. The words fell with
                  metallic distinctness upon the ear of the young man. The strangeness of the whole
                  thing gave them power, and for the first time in his life the idea came to him of
                  the prexistence of the Saviour to the human life of Jesus upon earth. As he
                  finished the chapter, Gardiner, simply saying, "Let us pray," knelt down beside
                  the little table. Maurice's first impulse was simply to bow his face upon his
                  hands, but something in him made him ashamed of this, and he, too, for the first
                  time in his life, knelt in worship.</p>
               <p>Whether the clergyman was extemporizing, or reading from a book, or repeating from
                  memory, he knew not. He did not look up, but the words flowed readily. A series of
                  brief prayers—each complete in itself, yet following as by a subtle law of
                  harmony—each with a central thought, and in language that, even in the midst of
                  his deep emotion, struck him as of rare beauty, then followed, ending with the
                  Lord's prayer and the simple and scriptural benediction which, even in the
                  Unitarian pulpit? had been familiar to him—a relic of its ancient Puritan faith.
                  Silence followed, and in that moment's pause, ere either rose from his knees, a
                  flood of unformed thoughts rushed upon the young man's mind.</p>
               <p>Gardiner rose presently, and taking up his travelling-case, held out his hand,
                  saying, "Good-night! I leave early in the morning, and shall not see you again,"
                  pressed the hand held out to him, and was gone.</p>
               <p>Maurice would fain have sate longer, but the obstinate fire had died to ashes, and
                  the cold drove him to his bed.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>THE next morning Maurice was roused by his <foreign xml:lang="ITA"
                     >veturo</foreign> at the early dawn, after the uncomfortable fashion of that
                  class, who will persist in beginning a day's journey which shall end in the middle
                  of the afternoon, before the cock-crowing. While he was sipping his cup of weak
                  coffee, and trying to persuade himself that the lukewarm raw egg which was served
                  with it was eatable, the Cameriere brought his bill, and with it a small package,
                  which in pantomime he intimated to Maurice was for him. At the same moment, the
                  impatient <foreign xml:lang="ITA">veturo</foreign> appeared and seized the
                  travelling-trunk, volubly pouring forth, meanwhile, an appeal to the traveller. He
                  could only slip the packet into his coat pocket, and make up from the strange
                  coins in his purse the amount of the bill, not forgetting the Cameriere's
                     "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">buono mano.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>It was too dark when he entered the vehicle to do aught but resume the slumber
                  from which he had been too early called; and when he woke, it was broad day. He
                  remembered the packet in his coat, and drew it forth. It was simply addressed to
                  him, with the number of his room at the inn. He tore off the wrapper, and found a
                  small prayer-book of the American Episcopal Church, with the name "S. Gardiner"
                  written in a thin, clear hand on the fly-leaf. It was a small octavo, somewhat
                  worn, with a plain gilt cross upon either cover. He spent some time turning over
                  its pages. At first it interested him much, For his college training enabled him
                  to appreciate the pure English of its style. It was something new to read in the
                  Gospels and Epistles the Scripture without separation into texts. The Psalter
                  caught his eye; and something unfamiliar in the twenty-third Psalm, which he had
                  often heard chanted in the Unitarian service, led him to take out his pocket-Bible
                  and compare the two. In spite of his avowed intention to treat the Bible as a
                  common book, it shocked his feeling of reverence a little to find the entire
                  version differing. So, promising himself to examine it hereafter in detail, he
                  turned to the hymns at the end. They did not please him. There was a directness of
                  devout expression, an orthodoxy, it seemed to him, which did not suit the refined
                  reticence of Harvard. So the book went into his pocket again, and the rest of the
                  day he saw it no more. At night, however, he took it and tried to use it, hut
                  could find nothing exactly appropriate to his mood of mind; the service for
                  evening prayer in families struck him as lengthy and wanting in power. If that was
                  the book Gardiner had used, as he suspected, it had lost its magic.</p>
               <p>At Ancona Maurice caught the diligence for Rome. Shut up in the interior with
                  three others—a German, an Italian, and a Frenchman—the journey was passed in a
                  dreamy vicissitude of mountain scenery and nights of broken slumbers—of strange
                  dinners at dirty inns—of a polyglot conversation and general fraternizing of
                  travelers—but all of it wholly external. It did him good, however—gave tone and
                  balance to his mind, which had been growing morbid in his solitary travel.</p>
               <p>Only once came a recurrence to his former thoughts. It was one morning when they
                  stopped to breakfast at Terni. A heavy-looking coach, profusely gilt, with a
                  cardinal's hat emblazoned on the panels, stood at the door of the <foreign
                     xml:lang="ITA">albergo.</foreign> The cardinal, a sour-looking, elderly man,
                  with long robes, under which his red stockings appeared, was just alighting. The
                  Italian uncovered, crossed himself, and knelt on the dirty pavement. The Frenchman
                  took off his hat, and Maurice did the same. The German slipped into the inn, with
                  a shrug of his shoulders. It was an hour after, as they were ascending a steep
                  hill, and the four passengers of the interior got out to walk, that the German, an
                  optician in the Corso at Rome, drew alongside of Maurice, and said, abruptly—"Why
                  did you, an American and a republican, bow to that priest?"</p>
               <p>"Oh," said Maurice, "I don't know—I like to be civil—it is the custom of the
                  country."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes, but to a priest—to a cardinal. You are not a Catholic?"</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7264-00000010"/>
               <p>"No, I am a Protestant—I suppose—that is—I am nothing."</p>
               <p>"Ah, so—that is good: then you understand me. These priests are the curse of
                  Italy. I hate them. I have to go to mass, once a year, at Easter—or else——Yes, I
                  have to, but then I believe nothing—that a bit of bread is God—well, it may be as
                  much God as there is, but I believe none of it. Luther began, but Strauss and the
                  Herr Doctor Bauer of Tbingen, and the great Schwegeler, have taken it up. Do you
                  read the French? Well, you must read the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">philosophie
                     positif</foreign>—that is grand, that is good. It is only in a republic, where
                  you have no kings or priests, that you can think. My business is good here, or I
                  would go to America. When the good time comes, we will put down all these priests
                  and the Holy Father the Pope—and have no mass and no marriage and no property any
                  more."</p>
               <p>Maurice was not quite delighted with this plain unveiling of infidelity in its
                  simple form, nor did he relish the. Dissertation against marriage which followed.
                  He had been brought up purely, like most New England Unitarian boys, but without,
                  of course, tile abiding scriptural reason that his body was the temple of the Holy
                  Spirit—which, as it never had been made so in baptism, he had never felt.</p>
               <p>But he was not prepared for the deliberate denial of all chastity to woman or of
                  all restraint to man. The conversation, which was mainly on the German's part,
                  haunted him all day long, and mingled in his weary dreams in the corner of the
                  diligence that night. It was the pitiless reduction to its lowest terms of his own
                  half-formed theories.</p>
               <p>He woke from his restless sleep the next morning as in the gray dawn they passed
                  the Milvian Bridge. "Sehen Sie, mein Herr," said the German, good-naturedly, "das
                  ist Rom." Maurice leant absorbed out of the carriage-window. There was a long line
                  of dim wall with a shadowy dome towering above, and the huge mass of the, Vatican
                  stretching away beside it. He watched and watched till the high vineyard-wall of
                  the road hid the view, and then sank back in his corner with his travelling-cap
                  pulled over his eyes. Tears were in them. There was a strange spell in the sight
                  of Rome, of St. Peter's, and a yearning, longing thought that his fate lay hidden
                  within those walls. An hour after, he caught a hurried glimpse of the Porto del
                  Popolo, and then of the tall Column of Antonine, and found himself gazing up at a
                  range of crumbling Corinthian pillars, with only a fragment of entablature above,
                  and, at the same time in the midst of a mob of porters, custom-house officers, and
                  the like. The instincts of travel returned; the bribery, and the trunk-opening,
                  and the carriage-calling were gone through with, and in another five minutes
                  Maurice found himself at the door of the Hotel d'Angleterre. A slight-built,
                  delicate-looking youth was just coming down the broad staircase. He stopped a
                  moment, and then seizing Maurice by the hand, exclaimed, "How are you, old
                  fellow?—this is jolly—I am so glad to see you. There are several of the boys here,
                  but you are the only Hasty Pud—of the whole lot. I am delighted to get a man, too,
                  who will care about pictures and ruins and all that. I've beep here three weeks.
                  Come, get your room and dress, and then we will go to breakfast."</p>
               <p>Just then a porter with a trunk ran against the speaker, and startled him a
                  little. He caught his breath, and the effort brought on a sharp fit of coughing.
                  When that was over, Maurice had engaged his room, and his friend was following him
                  up-stairs.</p>
               <p>"You see," said he, speaking slowly, "I—have—not—got rid of this cough; but I'm
                  better—much better."</p>
               <p>Better if he was, when he reached <foreign xml:lang="ITA">numero sette sei, al
                     terto,</foreign> he could only throw himself on the bed, while Maurice went
                  through the very necessary and much longed-for ablutions which three days and
                  nights of diligence-travel rendered indispensable. When Maurice began to dress,
                  however, his speech returned. Floods of questions were poured forth on both sides,
                  and plans formed enough to occupy a twelvemonth instead of a winter.</p>
               <p>It was quite late when they descended again to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">salle a
                     manger</foreign> to breakfast. There were only a couple of the usual travelling
                  Englishmen sitting over "Galignani," tea, and toast, at the far end of the table.
                  The two young men hardly hushed their joyous conversation a tone as they rattled
                  on.</p>
               <p>"Where first?" said Goodstowe, as Maurice gave signs of rest to his apparently
                  unappeasable appetite—"St. Peter's, or the Coliseum?"</p>
               <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7264-00000011"/>
               <p>"Well, I must go to Torlona's, for letters and money—which way is that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, that's toward the Old City—all right—come along. Where did you say Byron
                  Brooks had gone?—taken to preaching? What a fellow? Does Iced Lem-on-ade still
                  spree it as he used to? I met the Gorgeous Sunbeam when I came out, in Paris, and
                  he was richer than ever—seven colors in his raiment—the lilies of the field would
                  hardly hold a candle to him. No, I don't mean that, you know," said Frank
                  Goodstowe, coloring-up. "I have been so much with H—— and P——, and that set, that
                  I pick up their talk before I know it."</p>
               <p>"What's the harm in that?" said Maurice, wonderingly.</p>
               <p>"Why, you know, I'm sure, where that comparison is used, and by whom. Look," said
                  Frank, breaking off suddenly—"look!—this is Monte Cavallo, and those are the
                  horses of Phidias and Praxiteles. We're on the Quirinal."</p>
               <p>It was a warm whiter-noon when they came to the Forum and passed down the Appian
                  Way through the Arch of Titus. The soft air came pleasantly from the Campagna, and
                  Maurice was in an ecstasy of pleasure. Horace and Byron and Cicero and Hans
                  Andersen were all mingling together in his memory, as place after place came
                  before him with that familiar likeness of unlikeness with which the Old-World
                  scenes appear to the young American who has pored over the pictures of them from
                  his infancy. Mere strangeness is nothing; it is the charm of Sliding the inward
                  vision suddenly realized in the outward, and yet so differently, which makes
                  travel such a well of delights. Maurice would neither go on nor linger, but was
                  for reading every inscription through, and yet for hastening at once to the
                  Coliseum—with the unreasonable appetite of a child let loose in a
                  confectioner's.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>AT last, however, Frank, who was four weeks older in Roman experiences, contrived
                  to drag Maurice away and piloted him safely past the Golden House of Nero and
                  around to the unruined side of the Coliseum, where the outer-wall frowns in
                  uhdiminished grandeur. They stood in the shadow, and Maurice's eager eye seemed to
                  take in a photograph of the whole, from the wild grasses tufting the cornice, to
                  the crannies fretting the fallen stones at the base. There was a Latin inscription
                  upon a tablet let into the front. Maurice studied it for a moment, at first idly,
                  with the instinct of an American student of the classics, too eager over every bit
                  of the ancient tongue to distinguish between the Ciceronian and the Monastic.</p>
               <p>Suddenly he broke out in a tone of thorough surprise—"Why, Frank, this is a church
                  dedicated to the Martyrs."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Goodstowe, "go a step further and you will see where they
                  suffered."</p>
               <p>They entered the vast oval, and there in the centre was reared a plain cross.
                  Around the arena were built the canopied altars of the Romish Church. Maurice sat
                  down upon the stone benches of the lower tier in a fit of musing. Frank, the most
                  indulgent of ciceroni, would not disturb him.</p>
               <p>At length he broke the silence.</p>
               <p>"Why, Frank," said he, "here is the same Church to which the Martyrs and Apostles
                  belonged."</p>
               <p>"Of course it is: did you never think of that before?"</p>
               <p>"Why, no!—yes—that is, I never <emph>felt</emph> it before." Then, after a pause,
                  "This is, I suppose, the true Church."</p>
               <p>He brought out the words slowly and with a pained I expression, like one who
                  admits a disagreeable truth. Frank met the inquiry with a quiet smile, which
                  showed that he<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7264-00000012"/> was not taken by surprise,
                  but had felt and mastered the difficulty. He pointed in the direction of the
                  Capitol, and quietly said, "Is this city the Rome of the Consuls of the Empire? As
                  we came down the Appian, we saw that the ancient arches and the old pavement stood
                  twelve feet below the present level. It no longer occupies the same site; it has
                  moved away from that and left the old places desolate. That is the position of the
                  Roman Church. It is like the Medival Italian city reared over the grave of the
                  ancient Republican and Imperial one."</p>
               <p>"Then," said Maurice, "there is <emph>no</emph> true Church, for all modern
                  Churches came from Rome—that is, if your illustration holds good; which I don't
                  admit and don't deny."</p>
               <p>"Did Republican Government perish because the Roman Republic became an
                  empire?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Maurice, "but Roman Republicanism did. American Republicanism may be a
                  revival, but it is not a continuation of Roman."</p>
               <p>"I am fairly caught," said Frank; "but—but—I want to put the thing in another way.
                  Suppose the Roman Republicanism had been transplanted into England, and so brought
                  to us—then the failure of the source would not affect the continuation.
                  Christianity is not dead because Jerusalem, where it originated, fell into the
                  hands of the Mahometans."</p>
               <p>"Yes, very good; but you don't mean to say that our churches in America were so
                  transplanted?"</p>
               <p>"I mean to say that the One Holy Catholic Church has its representative in America
                  now."</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't understand all this; I'll think it up some time—but—I say—let us
                  get up on these walls—this is <emph>so</emph> glorious." And Maurice scrambled and
                  roamed, unheeding Frank's short breathing and occasional coughs, till the latter
                  plead fatigue, and begged to return to the hotel. Maurice assented, and seeing
                  Frank really looked ill, had the prudence to call a coach which was at hand near
                  the Coliseum—its driver on the lookout for stray tourists. Frank had to he down
                  till dinner, and Maurice spent the time in waiting up his journal and a letter or
                  two.</p>
               <p>At the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">table d'hote</foreign> they met a large body of
                  travelers—all English or Americans—and the conversation was quite general and
                  lively upon what had been or was to be seen.</p>
               <p>It was the 24th December, and everybody was full of the Christmas Eve ceremonies
                  which were to come off at the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore. Frank, refreshed by
                  sleep and his dinner, agreed to go. Young men are rarely tolerant of invalidism,
                  especially in their equals, and Maurice could not comprehend Frank's willingness
                  to lose any one of the great annual sights. So Frank, a little against his better
                  judgment, and himself rather eager, ventured out again.</p>
               <p>The night was clear, bright, and moonlit; slightly frosty, and the air brisk and
                  keen. They found the great church thronged. Its gilded ceiling glimmered in the
                  blaze of innumerable wax candles. There was a buzz and murmur of tourists in the
                  intervals of the chanting—a crowding to catch a glimpse of the procession of the
                  Pope in his chair, with the white peacock fans on either side, as he was borne
                  between ranks of soldiers. The marvellous cradle was solemnly carried up the nave.
                  Maurice remembered that Bethlehem stable had only a manger. The heat, and dust,
                  and incense were all but stifling. They had to stand until Frank, nearly fainting,
                  had to beg Bryan to leave. It was not easy to force one's way through the crowd.
                  Frank was sharply elbowed by a great burly young English Jesuit from the
                  Propaganda, and pressed his hand upon his panting chest with a gesture and look of
                  pain. At last they reached the silent portico and the open air. Frank drew a long
                  breath of relief, and then, as the keen night air filled his lungs, coughed
                  terribly. At the end of his attack he was spitting blood. Then Maurice, really
                  alarmed, rushed up to a carriage, and importuned the driver in his best French.
                  The man hesitated, but a large round <foreign xml:lang="ITA">scudo</foreign>
                  shining in the moonlight prevailed. Maurice almost lifted Frank in, and then the
                  driver whipped up his horses into a run, that he might be back in time for his own
                  proper fares, for whom he was waiting. The jolting over the pavements did Frank's
                  cough no good, and when he reached the Angleterre he was quite exhausted. Luigi,
                  Frank's courier, was summoned and the two got Frank to bed and administered a
                  sedative for the cough, which gave temporary relief. Bryan would have watched till
                  Frank slept, but Frank said "No;" and only asked to be let to rest.</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7264-00000013"/>
               <p>"Is there anything more I can do?" said Maurice at the room-door.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Frank, "just one thing. My eyes pain me—please shade the light, and
                  then"—he hesitated a moment—"please take this little book and read to me the
                  prayers on this page."</p>
               <p>Maurice felt sadly embarrassed, but he did not like to show it. He took the book,
                  and standing by the bedside—for he could not in fact well kneel, and did not like
                  to sit—read, in as reverential a manner as he knew how, the collects on the
                  designated page of the little manual. When he ended, Frank put out his hand,
                  pressed that of Maurice, and said, in a whisper, "Thank you, dear Bryan,—Christ
                  bless you,—good-night."</p>
               <p>Maurice went away with an undefined sense of apprehension and sadness. He strolled
                  out to the Piazza di Spagna and passed a half-hour with his cigar upon the
                  glorious Spanish steps, where by day the models of the painters cluster, and old
                  Peppo, king of the beggars, whom every one ever in Rome knows so well, shambles
                  round on his stumps, and cries in his lusty voice, "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">Buon
                     Giorno, Signore.</foreign>" He thought of home, of his sick friend, and of the
                  Christmas Eve service he had once witnessed in a little church in his native town.
                  Gradually his musings went Bethlehem-wards, and he found himself wondering why
                  Christmas Eve should so long have been kept in the world. "There is something in
                  it," he said at last to himself—"the Bible cannot be a collection of myths—I give
                  up the legendary theory."</p>
               <p>The next morning Maurice stole softly to Frank's room. The door was gently opened,
                  in answer to his light tap, by the watchful Luigi. "He sleep, <foreign
                     xml:lang="ITA">'celenza,</foreign>" said the courier, forming the words with
                  his lips, but scarcely making a sound. "If he sleep he will do well," murmured
                  Maurice, little thinking of the ominous coincidence in his words. So he went down,
                  relieved in mind, to the breakfast-table, and there, as was his wont, made
                  acquaintance with a fellow-traveller, a long-legged Lieutenant of an East Indian
                  regiment, going home by the overland route, on leave,—and the two agreed to go to
                  St. Peter's together.</p>
               <p>"By Jove," said the Englishman, when in the street,—"how odd one feels in a
                  dress-coat in the morning,—it's like going to a funeral, d' ye know."</p>
               <p>Both the young men did feel rather awkwardly, attired in solemn black, without
                  even a paletot to cover their sable-ness. Swarms of beggars dashed-alongside as
                  they strode down the Via Babuino. The Lieutenant swore at them in Hindostanee.
                  Maurice gave a copper coin or two to one of the most hideously repulsive; but when
                  a wretch insisted upon stripping the cloth from his face to show the cancer which
                  half covered it, (artistically painted there by Smudgers, of the Caf Greco, that
                  very morning,) he raised his hand threateningly.</p>
               <p>"I say," said the Lieutenant, "don't do that now, you'll have the police on you;
                  here's a dodge I was put up to in Florence, the other day,"—and he made a queer
                  backhanded shake with his right forefinger, at which freemasonry the beggar gave a
                  knowing look and fell back at once. They passed on toward the Bridge of St.
                  Angelo.</p>
               <p>"I say, I suppose we shall have to miss chapel," continued he. "I don't quite like
                  that—for I never did stay away from church an a Christmas day; but then it's the
                  Stilton to do High Mass at St. Peter's, and then there's an awful Puseyite mess at
                  the chapel—candles and flowers and all that—and one might as well have the real
                  turtle as the mock. I'm not one of your beastly Low Churchmen, either; but I'm an
                  old Rugby fellow, and I can't go this Oxford nonsense But," he added, "I beg your
                  pardon—perhaps you are in that way."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no," said Maurice, "not at all; in fact, I don't well know what it means. I
                  am not in the habit of going to church Christmas day. We do not in America, except
                  a few Episcopalians."</p>
               <p>"You don't mean that you're a Dissenter? Come, now, you are too good a fellow for
                  that."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am not anything just now," said Maurice, rather embarrassed.</p>
               <p>The young Briton gave a broad stare—the two could hardly make each other out. "But
                  come, now, that won't do, you know," said the Englishman. "You had better go out
                  to India and see what those beggars out there are like, and you'd soon settle
                  yourself. I can't say what I mean," he went on, getting red in the face and
                  beginning to stammer, "but—but a man must believe if he has work to do in the
                  world, and got to be under fire and do his duty by a lot of<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000014"/> these poor ignorant soldiers. By Jove, if I didn't
                  believe I should have gone to the bad long ago. However, perhaps, it's different
                  in America—though I can't for the life of me see how."</p>
               <p>"May be," said Maurice, half to himself, "I shall find what I want here. How
                  superb!" he cried, as they entered upon the vast piazza of St. Peter's and the
                  whole magnificent view broke upon them.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant shook his head and held his peace, honestly bewildered at such a
                  strange phenomenon as the young skeptic. There was a gentleness, an almost
                  guileless seeming about Maurice, appearing in his tones and manners, which drew
                  every one he met toward him, and that which made the Englishman call him, upon
                  their first acquaintance, "a good fellow," served to perplex thoroughly the
                  latter.</p>
               <p>No more conversation passed between them till they reached the entrance. They were
                  admitted at once, leaving behind a dozen unfortunates, who had thought to palm off
                  a sham upon the infallible Church by pinning up their frock-coat skirts into the
                  semblance of dress-coat tails. The infallible Church, being well versed in all
                  varieties of shams, soon detected these impostors, and brought them to shame and
                  confusion of face.</p>
               <p>The vast nave was not crowded; it never is. It seems as if all Rome, and her
                  foreign visitors to boot, could not crowd it. But when they reached the High Altar
                  under the dome, they found themselves in a mob of tourists, monks, and officers,
                  rendering it difficult for them to catch a clear view of what was going on. Behind
                  the open space where they stood, were temporary boxes, draped with scarlet, in
                  which sat ladies in black, with black veiled heads, and bonnetless. The
                  Englishman's length of limb enabled him to see over the crowd, but Maurice, who
                  was shorter, soon left him, and elbowed his way through the throng to a front
                  place. The spectacle was less imposing than he expected. The poor old Pope had a
                  wearied look while the tedious ceremonies went on—the taking off and putting on of
                  numerous vestments, with inaudible Latin prayers murmured the while—flourishes of
                  the thurible and the like—ceremonies to the young New Englander altogether
                  unintelligible. What struck him especially, was the uninterested manner of most of
                  the high ecclesiastics, especially as it contrasted with the rapt devotion tion of
                  the contadina kneeling in the outside space where the multitude were permitted,
                  and the absorbed, almost ecstatic worship of a few ladies who occupied private
                  boxes near the Papal throne. It was whispered in the crowd that these were English
                  ladies of high rank, and Maurice caught the whispered name of a recent
                  distinguished pervert, whose novels he remembered to have read.</p>
               <p>The High Altar of St. Peter's stands directly beneath the mighty dome. Four
                  hundred feet above it in the air is the lantern upon which the ball and cross are
                  built. A canopy, ninety feet in height, is over the altar. Behind it is the
                  throne, in the upper arm of the Latin cross, in which St. Peter's is constructed,
                  a space large as one of the largest American churches, but which, in St. Peter's,
                  appears scarcely more than a recess.</p>
               <p>Near the Pope's Throne is the huge monument of that Pontiff who decked it before
                  his death with the figures of his mistresses, sculptured as allegory; contrary to
                  the usual custom, his tiara is not placed on his head, but laid at his feet, in
                  token of the extraordinary and shameless vileness of his life.</p>
               <p>The way from the throne to the altar was covered with a temporary carpet, and on
                  each side were ranged the Guarda Nobile, each a noble of Rome, in their splendid
                  uniform. They stood, with swords drawn, motionless military statues, only their
                  crested cavalry helmets betraying, by a movement of their flowing horse-tails,
                  that they possessed life.</p>
               <p>At last the long services drew to a close. The Pope left his throne and advanced
                  toward the altar, the train of his heavy robes upborne by Acolytes. He knelt for a
                  moment, and then, amid a stillness like the hush of a summer noontide, took into
                  his hands the sacred emblems.</p>
               <p>He pronounced the words of consecration, probably the ancient form which Linus and
                  Anacletus had used, and then, with both hands, he raised high the jewelled and
                  glittering Monstrance. Every head was bowed; the Guarda Nobile, with the perfect
                  oneness of military movement, sank on one knee, and lowered their shining swords
                  till their points clashed upon the pavement, while a burst of triumphant music
                  rang through the vast church and echood down the mighty arches of the nave and
                  aisles. Chanting voices, clear and high and heavenly sweet, the voices of the<pb
                     n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7264-00000015"/> soprani and choir-boys, sounded with it.
                  The impression was overwhelming, irresistible, and Maurice bowed his head. Once
                  more the Pontiff's sonorous voice was the only sound, the "HIC EST SANGUIS MEUS"
                  clearly heard, and the chalice was raised with the same dramatic splendor of
                  effect. For a few seconds the genius of Roman, art enveloped Maurice in its spell,
                  and he bent his knee and hid his face with his hands, knowing not why. It was a
                  brief trance. As he rose with the rest, right before him was a monk, whose greasy
                  woollen robe was redolent of other odors than that of sanctity, and whose face, as
                  he turned to leer at the ladies in the boxes, was the repulsive mask of a
                  satyr.</p>
               <p>The finale came soon. The Pope, with a sigh of relief, returned to his throne, and
                  was presently borne out on his dizzy seat; a performance so "tottlish," (to use a
                  child's word,) as to be rather ludicrous than otherwise.</p>
               <p>Maurice looked around for his English friend, but he was lost in the crowd now
                  hurrying toward the entrance. He loitered behind, for it was his first visit to
                  St. Peter's. He soon worked into the clearer region of the side aisle, and paused
                  to read the inscription of that tablet whereon is carved, "Henricus IX. Rex.
                  Angliterr." Something, very like a disturbance, near, interrupted his reverie over
                  the Stuarts—by the way, always to the educated New Englander a most romantic
                  theme, in which Scott and Carlyle oddly contend for mastery. He saw a couple of
                  ladies were in trouble. An Italian, of the lower orders, was annoying them with
                  importunities; Maurice could not tell wherefore. He saw them shrink back from the
                  man's volubility, and heard a few words of English spoken by the elder to the
                  younger. He hurried to their aid, and learned in a word their difficulty. The
                  fellow claimed that they had engaged him as guide, he having evidently mistaken
                  his party. Maurice spoke a few words in French to the man, and sent him,
                  grumbling, away. Then turned to the ladies, and asked what could he do for them?
                  They took in his position at a glance, and, evidently relieved a little, the elder
                  lady spoke. They were seeking their carriage. Her son, she said, was a clergyman;
                  but, not wearing the regulation dress-coat, had been separated from them at the
                  door. They were to meet in the portico, and were seeking him when the Italian had
                  followed and annoyed them. Maurice at once offered his services, saying, "I am an
                  American." The elder lady was tall, her dark curls here and there touched with
                  gray, her features high and dignified, and about her face Maurice thought he saw a
                  familiar look. "Since you are a countryman," said she, "we will trouble you as far
                  as our carriage. I thank you very much."</p>
               <p>They made their way to the open air, and Maurice, finding a place where the ladies
                  could stand in safety, went in search of their coach, the number of which they had
                  fortunately taken. It was not easy in such a jam to find the right one; and when
                  he returned he found a tall gentleman standing beside them, who turned, and
                  Maurice beheld the familiar face of Gardiner. Explanations, warm greetings, and
                  the like, follow. Maurice was offered the spare seat in their carriage—and found
                  that they were at the Angleterre also. He was presented in form by Gardiner to his
                  mother and his young niece, Miss Maud De Forrest. Once seated in the carriage as
                  her <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vis-a-vis,</foreign> Maurice was enabled to see and
                  scan the faces of his new acquaintance. The elder lady we have described before.
                  The younger did not appear to be a relative, for she was a blonde. She, in spite
                  of her English name, was an American, with the delicacy of feature so
                  characteristic of the spring-tide of our girlhood. Her eyes were a deep blue, and
                  there was a dark shading of the braids of hair which crossed her forehead which
                  distinguished them from the washed-out, colorless tresses of Germany. It was the
                  hue Bryant has so admirably hit off in a single line— <q>
                     <l>"Brown in the shadow and gold in the sun."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There was, however, in somewhat of contrast to the gentleness of the whole upper
                  face, touch of firmness about the small mouth, and a rather decided rounding of
                  the chin, which gave character to the face at the cost of pure conformity to the
                  classic statuesque type. Like other ladies that day, she was dressed in black,
                  with a black lace veil.</p>
               <p>The conversation soon turned upon the ceremonies witnessed. Gardiner remarked that
                  he had gained a tolerably good view of them. "You know, mother," he said, "I went
                  back to the hotel and got a dress-coat; but could not join you. I thought of going
                  to Chapel, but then as we had<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7264-00000016"/> service
                  with the Bishop of Gibraltar in his parlor this morning, it did not matter; and
                  after what H—— said to me last night, I thought it was not best to commit myself
                  by being present at ——'s absurd performances there. I find it is quite a party
                  matter with our friends, and on their account I would not compromise myself."</p>
               <p>Maurice himself felt a slight revulsion of feeling at his own enthusiasm, and with
                  the audacity of young New England liberalism jested at the affair. "I wonder that
                  such mummery could move any one. The elevation of the Host was very fine, but what
                  meaning is there in it all? What is the Host? I'm sure I don't know." The young
                  lady looked at him with a serious look of astonishment, and then glanced rather
                  timidly at her uncle.</p>
               <p>"Oh, but, Miss De Forrest, I'm sure <emph>you</emph> don't know," continued Bryan.
                  "Young ladies are always very learned in all foreign customs; but unless you are a
                  Catholic—You don't belong to the Catholic Church, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"I trust I do," she replied, and was about to add something more, but Maurice,
                  coloring deeply, interrupted her.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon—sincerely. I did not dream of it for a
                  moment; please excuse me—let us talk of something else. I shall offend you by my
                  unlucky blunders."</p>
               <p>Maud slaw his error, but the moment of explanation slipped away, and she seriously
                  doubted whether he could be readily made to comprehent what she meant. So she
                  merely smiled to show she was not offended, and the conversation took a different
                  turn.</p>
               <p>"Have you seen any of the galleries yet?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Not yet," said she. "We begin to-morrow at the Borghese."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I am going there too. Frank Goods to we, my friend, whom I met here, says it
                  is splendid."</p>
               <p>"That tall gentleman you were with at St. Peter's?" said the elder lady. Miss De
                  Forrest said nothing, but became suddenly paler.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no," said Maurice; "Frank is ill at the hotel, poor fellow; his lungs are
                  delicate, and he has had a slight attack of bleeding."</p>
               <p>"Is he from S——, in New York State?" continued Mrs. Gardiner.</p>
               <p>"I think he is; I knew him at Harvard; he was my classmate: a capital fellow; of
                     <emph>your</emph> Church, too," said with a slight stress on the pronoun,
                  turning to Gardiner. "We used to call him the parson, in college, but a better
                  fellow never lived;—not like the Orthodox generally, who are not always gentlemen,
                  and who sometimes will give information to the faculty, and always stand out
                  against rebellions."</p>
               <p>"Did he take a good degree?" asked Gardiner.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, sir, in the second eight; might have been in the first; was one of our
                  best writers and speakers, but would not take the trouble; rather preferred to
                  mouse round in the library." He was fond of the river, too. I have had many a
                  glorious pull with him by moonlight, in a fisherman's dory he kept, down through
                  the bridges to the old Powder-house wharf."</p>
               <p>Just then the carriage stopped at the Angleterre. Maurice had scarcely time to
                  hand out the ladies, when his arm was touched by Luigi, on the watch for him. He
                  turned, and the deep grief on the worthy Courier's face made him forget the
                  ladies, and Gardiner, and everything else.</p>
               <p>"Il Signore Francesco is very bad. Another"—and Luigi touched his lungs in
                  expressive pantomime. Maurice waited for no more, but sprang up the stairs, three
                  at a time. Luigi followed more slowly. As Maurice entered Frank's room he found
                  him sitting up in bed—propped by pillows—his face ghastly pale, and the windows
                  open, in spite of the cold, which at Borne is quite noticeable at Christmas. A
                  young physician, an Englishman, staying in the hotel, was in the room, preparing a
                  stimulant. He held up his finger as Maurice entered, as a warning to him to keep
                  quiet. Goodstowe made a sign with his thin hand, which he could hardly lift from
                  the bedclothes, and the Doctor was at his side in an instant, moving with that
                  quiet gliding step only learned in sick-chambers. Frank spoke something in a low
                  whisper, and the medical man turned to Maurice and said quietly—"Do you know of
                  any clergyman of the English or American Churches now in Rome? Your friend has
                  just sent for the Chaplain here, but it being Christmas Day he will probably be
                  dining out somewhere."</p>
               <p>Just then Luigi entered. "The chaplain Inglese is not<pb n="32-33"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000017"/> chez lui," said lie. Frank's face was very sad to
                  see, and large tears came into his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Stop a moment," said Maurice, "perhaps I can do it." And he was starting for the
                  door, when Frank made an impetuous movement, (followed, alas, by a cough, fearful
                  to hear,) which the physician's quick eye caught, and arresting Maurice by one
                  hand, he laid the other upon Frank's, and bent down his ear to listen. It seemed
                  an age, though in a moment Frank's words came labored and
                  faint—"Church—clergy"——"Yes, yes!" said Maurice, and was off. He hardly knew how,
                  so breathless and instinctive was every movement, but he found himself knocking at
                  Gardiner's door. The clergyman opened it, meeting him with an inquiring
                  look—almost stern—which softened on seeing Maurice's agitation. The young man
                  sobbed rather than spoke—"Frank is dying—wants a clergyman—<emph>can</emph> you
                  come?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, of course," said Gardiner; and instantly tapping at the inner door of
                  the next room <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en suite,</foreign> he said—"Mother, we will
                  not dine till the five o'clock <foreign xml:lang="FRA">table d'hote.</foreign> I
                  am called to a sick person;" and, without waiting for a response, turned toward
                  the corridor.</p>
               <p>As they went toward Frank's room—"Do you happen, know," said he, "if your friend
                  has been confirmed?"</p>
               <p>"I hardly know," said Maurice; "I remember seeing a book on his table about
                  Confirmation, and he had to go into Boston one day about that time—it was in our
                  Junior year—to see the Bishop; he missed a society-meeting by it; but I really
                  can't say, I don't think I know what confirming really is." Gardiner did not
                  reply—only nodded.</p>
               <p>They had by this time reached Frank's room. As they went in Gardiner said,
                  quietly—"Peace be to this house and to all within"—and then went at once to the
                  sick bedside. With a glance he seemed to take in the whole situation. Frank's face
                  brightened, and a sweet, pure smile came over it. The physician said,
                  respectfully, but firmly—"He must not talk; I cannot answer for it if he
                  does."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, of course not," said Gardiner; "only make a sign, yes or no, to my
                  questions. You have been baptized?" Frank bowed. "And confirmed?" Frank bowed
                  again. "Have you ever communed?" Frank shook his head sadly. "You are entitled to
                  the communion now if you desire it." Frank's face flushed, he closed his eyes a
                  moment, and then reverently bent his head. Without saying more Gardiner knelt down
                  by the bedside, and, holding Frank's hand in his, prayed for forgiveness of sins,
                  and faith and penitence for this sick member of the Church. The physician and
                  Maurice remained standing, but Maurice's eyes were blinded with fast-coming tears.
                  Then rising, Gardiner asked—"Dost thou believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker
                  of heaven and earth?" and continued through every article of the creed, Frank
                  making a faint sign of assent to each. When it came to the words "Holy Catholic
                  Church," Maurice gave a slight start—they had acquired a new meaning to him. He
                  was bewildered, too, at the perfect readiness with which each seemed to understand
                  the other, and yet astonished at the solemnity and fitness of the whole. He had
                  been sick, dangerously sick, while in college; and after he was better, a
                  clergyman, one of the Faculty, had called to see him, but seemed afraid to talk
                  with him, and finally got out something about thankfulness to Divine Providence—he
                  did not appear to like to say "God"—in delivering him from sickness, and then was
                  glad to change the subject to the approaching Exhibition. He remembered this
                  now.</p>
               <p>"Are you able to receive the Sacrament now?" asked Gardiner. Frank made an
                  affirmative sign. He turned to the Doctor,—"You are a member of the English
                  Church; will you receive with him?"</p>
               <p>The Doctor shook his head—"I'm not, you know—you see I ought to be watching him."
                  And then stepping to Gardiner's side, and drawing him to the chamber-door, said
                  something in too low a tone for any of the rest to hear. Gardiner replied without
                  losing the quiet manner proper to a sick-room, but with a decision that allowed of
                  no appeal,—"You will be kind enough to remain in the next room till I call for
                  you. I am used to sickness, and will be responsible; I cannot have you here." The
                  Doctor shrugged his shoulders, a slight sneer curled his lip, but he walked
                  without parley into the sitting-room.</p>
               <p>Gardiner turned, and after a moment's pause, said to Maurice,—"You of course
                  cannot join with us, but will you remain? you can support your friend in your
                  arms, as he appears too weak to sit up, and to he down would suffocate<pb
                     n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7264-00000018"/> him." Frank's face showed the pleasure he
                  felt at Gardiner's considerate kindness, and Maurice could not speak, so deeply
                  was he touched; but he took his place, half sitting, half kneeling on the bedside,
                  and raised and held Frank firmly and tenderly. Gardiner left the room, beckoning
                  to Luigi, who presently came back, and placed against the wall opposite the bed a
                  small table, covered with a white cloth. In a few minutes Gardiner reappeared,
                  followed by the two ladies Maurice had met that morning. Maud's face was no longer
                  pale, a bright flush burned on each cheek, and her lips were firmly set. She
                  glanced quickly at Frank, who did not appear to notice her, and a slight shade of
                  relief seemed to come over her face. Gardiner said simply, "My mother and my
                  niece," by way of introduction. Maud placed herself by the head of the bed, out of
                  the range of Frank's view—but where, as it happened, from Maurice's position, he
                  could see her. The clergyman placed upon the little table a tiny cup of silver,
                  and a small plate of the same metal. Then opening a delicate damask napkin, he
                  laid a little square of bread upon it, and filled the cup with wine from a
                  graceful silver flagon. He laid over them a veil of fine lawn, with an embroidered
                  cross and monogram, worked within the circle of the crown of thorns. He placed an
                  open Bible behind these, resting against the wall. Maud rose from her seat, and,
                  still standing so as to be behind Frank, placed before him her own little
                  prayer-book, open at the office of the Communion of the sick. Frank motioned
                  toward the centre-table, where some books were lying. The elder lady took a
                  prayer-book,—Frank's own,—and handed it to him; he found the place, and put it
                  into Maurice's disengaged hand. He said softly, "Will not you want it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, the service is familiar to me, by heart."</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Luigi had been looking curiously on. He crossed himself, a the Roman
                  Catholics do, and then slipping into the next room, returned bringing two wax
                  candles and a vase of flowers. He placed these upon the little table, and lighted
                  the candles. It was quite dusk in the room, for the day was very cloudy, and
                  Gardiner made no objection, only exchanged a word or two in French with Luigi, who
                  then knelt near the foot of the bed. Gardiner stepped into the sitting-room a
                  moment,—the physician administered a few drops of the restorative he had prepared,
                  and then retired once more as Gardiner reentered in surplice and stole, and knelt
                  down at the simple little altar he had prepared. After a short silent prayer he
                  rose, and while the two ladies stood, read the Collect, Epistle and Gospel, which
                  Maurice found in the open prayer-book before him. This, with the invitation to the
                  Communion, struck Maurice as rather formal. The parts succeeding each other so
                  rapidly, and the annunciation of each beforehand, seemed to him confusing and yet
                  labored. But when Gardiner knelt once more, and all the voices joined in the
                  confession, a deep awe fell upon it as he listened to those words of fervent
                  humility and sorrow. Yet in his state of mental tension, he seemed himself to
                  experience that dual personality which belongs to the passive endurance of great
                  and protracted emotion,—in which one half of ourself appears to watch and
                  criticise the other. He thought to himself, "How can any dare to come to the
                  Communion after saying such things of themselves?" He had the New-England feeling
                  that one must be conscious of a sinless perfection first,—that idea which
                  underlies all phases of religious thought resulting from Puritan culture. Then the
                  Priest rose and pronounced the Absolution, turning toward Frank and holding his
                  hand just above the young man's bowed head. It seemed most personal, most direct,
                  nor was this lessened by the deep authority of the low fervent tones.</p>
               <p>Then followed the "Comfortable Words," never to be forgotten after they have been
                  heard beside the bed of death—the sentences which witness of the Incarnation and
                  the Resurrection, the two pillars which uphold our earthly life. Then Gardiner
                  turned to the altar again and read the preface for Christmas Day, and the three
                  voices mingled iii that rapt ascription, the song of the Angel and Archangel.
                  Maurice thrilled through and through, and he felt his skeptical lightness fall
                  from him like a cast-off garment. Gardiner knelt once more, and recited the prayer
                  of humble access. The slow, deliberate pausing upon the words seemed to breathe
                  from the speaker's very soul, and Maurice followed them as if for his life.</p>
               <p>But he was startled when Gardiner rose again, and taking care to stand so that
                  Frank could see every movement, seemed, while reciting the Lord's own act, to
                     repeat<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7264-00000019"/> its gestures step by step.
                  Maurice had never before seen the rite, excepting that day, in St. Peter's, in the
                  Roman Mass. When the Bread was literally taken and broken, when the Cup was
                  touched by the Priest's hand, a very strange feeling came upon him. It seemed
                  either awfully real or awfully wrong,—he hardly knew which. He tried to follow the
                  prayers which succeeded, but his thought wandered in spite of himself; and beside
                  that, anxiety for Frank, whose form seemed more and more to rest helplessly in his
                  arms, gained upon him. The hush in which Gardiner, kneeling, partook of both the
                  elements, was to him almost unendurably long. It was a relief when the Priest
                  rose, and holding the tiny Paten in his left hand, extended his right in
                  benediction over his kneeling mother, while he said, "The Body of our Lord Jesus
                  Christ, which was given for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting
                  life." Then, laying the Bread upon her open hand, he continued, "Take and eat this
                  in remembrance that Christ died for thee, and feed on Him in thy heart by faith
                  with thanksgiving." He did the same with Maud, looked a moment to Luigi, who
                  crossed himself once more, but shook his head, and then came to Frank. He laid his
                  hand gently upon Frank's forehead as he pronounced the first sentence, and then
                  laid the rest of the Sacramental Bread upon his hand. Goodstowe made an effort in
                  vain to raise it to his lips, and his breath was faint and fluttering. Gardiner
                  put it to his mouth, and Frank made an effort to swallow it, with success, but
                  Maurice felt his whole frame shudder with emotion and weakness. The Priest then
                  administered the Cup—only a few drops remaining as he came last to Frank. He
                  placed the chalice to the dying lips, and Frank was just able to empty it.
                  Gardiner had turned to place the vessels upon the table, and was just spreading
                  the gauzy covering over them, when a cry from his mother made him turn quickly.
                  Frank was seized with a fierce spasm, and half rose from Maurice's shoulder, and
                  then sank back again, the paleness of death upon his face, but with a smile of
                  holy calm over all his features. Maud half rose and caught his drooping hand which
                  hung down beside the bed—felt the pulse. Luigi darted from the room, and summoned
                  the Doctor. He came at once and placed his hand upon Frank's heart. It had ceased
                  to beat. He bowed to Gardiner, and saying, "I did not think he would last till
                  now," quietly left the room. They laid the lifeless form upon the bed and closed
                  the eyes, while Maurice sank upon his knees in a great agony of tears.</p>
               <p>Gardiner repeated the Lord's prayer, in which both ladies joined in voices broken
                  by sobs, and then another prayer, which Maurice lost entirely, in the amazement of
                  his sorrow.</p>
               <p>Then slowly, but with firmer accents, the three, rising began the Gloria in
                  Excelsis. Maurice had risen also, all but mechanically, and stood looking upon the
                  silent face of the dead. He was half inclined to resent this continuance of the
                  service as a bitter mummery—now that its purpose seemed ended—when a strange
                  thought was born, as it were, into his mind. "If Frank's faith be true," it said
                  to him, "is not this the very utterance of the released soul in its deliverance
                  from earth?"</p>
               <p>So it was that he knelt again with the rest, and for the first time in all his
                  life was spoken above him the Apostolic Benediction—</p>
               <p>"The Peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in
                  the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and the
                  blessing of God Almighty—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost—be amongst you
                  and remain with you always!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>WHEN the hush of the last moment had passed, the two ladies hastily left the room.
                  Gardiner threw off his surplice, and said softly to Maurice, "Wait here till I
                  return." In a few moments he reentered; Maurice sat motionless by the corpse,
                  holding Frank's hand in his. Luigi was sobbing in one corner. "Had your friend,"
                  said Gardiner, "relatives at home to whom we ought to send?"</p>
               <p>Maurice was recalled to the care of the living, as Gardiner saw was best he should
                  be. "No parents," said he. "I think he had an uncle, who was his guardian, but I
                  do not know his name or address."</p>
               <p>"Luigi," said the clergyman, "Did your master give you any papers to take care of,
                  lately?"</p>
               <p>"Si, Signore. He write last night; he say he die soon; he tell me give it to
                  Signor Maurigi;" and Luigi drew from his breast a folded packet. It contained a
                  note for Maurice as follows:—</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"DEAR BRYAN—when you read this, I shall be gone. Take charge of these papers,
                     pay my bills, and see that Luigi has a handsome present. You will find my purse
                     in the lid of my trunk. If more is needed, apply to my uncle," Thomas B.
                     Goodstowe, care of Goodstowe and Coles, New York. If there is any left, give it
                     to the Poor-Box of the English Chapel. I am too tired to write.
                     Rememb—Colis—our talk"——</p>
               </q>
               <p>The writing of these last words ran into a shapeless scrawl, and only the
                  fragments here indicated were legible. A spot of blood on the margin told the
                  story. The packet contained also the key of Frank's trunk and a few memoranda. One
                  of these was as follows: "My will is in the hands of I. Davis, attorney, New York,
                  35 Nassau Street." There was a pocket-diary, some miscellaneous papers, and a
                  folded copy of verses. These last Maurice put away unread.</p>
               <p>While Maurice was thus engaged, Gardiner had summoned the landlord and sent a
                  servant for the English chaplain. The landlord was assured that all expenses
                  should be met, and directed to send for a proper undertaker; all of which he
                  seemed to understand, and then as the chaplain did not come, they sent for the
                  doctor who had attended Frank. He luckily was aware what steps were necessary, and
                  gave a few concise, clear directions, to which Gardiner listened attentively.
                  Maurice took possession of Frank's trunk, and had it removed to his own room. He
                  took Frank's Prayer-Book from the table, and placed it in his pocket, and then sat
                  down to watch by the body. Luigi placed the little table by the head of the bed,
                  with the lighted candles upon it. "The master," he said, "was a good Christian.
                  Your English priests are not like our priests, but that was good." Presently
                  Gardiner signed to him as they went out together.</p>
               <p>It was a long and weary watch for Maurice. Christmas day faded into night. The
                  undertaker came, the sexton of the English chapel, grave, quiet, and respectful.
                  The body was shrouded and placed in a coffin, and then silence once more. Maurice
                  was face to face with the great mystery of death. It was the first time in his
                  young life. Before the coffin came, it had still been Frank his friend who was
                  there, but now the change was fully realized to him, when the face and form were
                  shut out from sight. Awe came upon him, something like disquiet at the last. He
                  turned over the pages of the Prayer-Book listlessly, unable to fix his attention
                  upon anything. At length Gardiner reappeared. "Will you see the English chaplain,
                  sir?" he said to Maurice. "I am told he is below." Luigi followed, with two of the
                  undertaker's men, who came to watch, and Maurice was glad to go out of that sad
                  room. In the salon below they found a florid and rather portly gentleman in a
                  rather ultra-clerical dress. "The Rev. Stephen Gardiner?" said he, inquiringly, as
                  they entered.</p>
               <p>"That is my name," said the American clergyman. "I am an American clergyman, a
                  Presbyter of the diocese of New York. We sent for you,—this is Mr. Maurice, a
                  countryman of mine, and the intimate friend of the dead,—to ask concerning the
                  funeral."</p>
               <p>"Eh! really, now, I'm very sorry, but I'm hardly at<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000021"/> leisure to attend to it,—it must be, you know, at
                  night, and the Protestant ground is so shockingly far off. I'm not at all well,
                  and Lord Ellesdean is quite ill; and I'm in constant attendance on him. You know
                  I'm not the regular man here, only taking the cure while W—— is away. Now you 're
                  in orders, I think you said, I dessay you wouldn't at all mind taking the
                  duty."</p>
               <p>"I expect to," said Gardiner, quietly. "I desired to see you in order to know what
                  steps were necessary to obtain permission from the government."</p>
               <p>"Oh! aye, really I can't say. You've a consul, or an ambassador, or something of
                  the sort here. I've sent you our sexton, who will do the thing very properly. Did
                  your young friend send for me in his illness?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but you were not in," said Gardiner; "the case was urgent,—a sudden bleeding
                  of the lungs,—and I was at hand and gave him, at his desire, the Sacrament. I
                  presume you would hardly, under the circumstances, consider it a trespass on your
                  cure, as Mr. Goodstowe was a member of the American Church."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, no, by no means; you're in the city, you know, in the Bishop of Rome's
                  diocese, and you must settle that with him. By the by, I never, you know, do that
                  thing. Outside the walls I'm not in the diocese of Home, but in that of Ponte
                  Milvio; and as I cannot find my diocesan, I venture to act, d'ye see, taking it
                  for granted that, as I am in the practice of the rites of the Church Catholic, he
                  would approve."</p>
               <p>"I must say, I admire your distinction," said the American; "as my Conscience does
                  not trouble me about the Bishop of Rome's limits, I shall officiate to my own
                  countrymen where they need me."</p>
               <p>"But, my dear Sir," said the chaplain, "that is schismatic, very schismatic,
                  positive dissent."</p>
               <p>"Well, it may be dissent, but as I cannot worship with the Bishop of Rome, I
                  certainly do not mean to go without worship; and while he denies me the Sacrament
                  in its fulness, I shall receive it when I can get it unmutilated."</p>
               <p>"Now, I really can't agree with you there; there's a vast deal to be said on the
                  other side. Of course if there is a Real Presence, and I fancy you won't deny
                  that, it ought to be altogether in all parts of the Sacramental elements alike. We
                  can't divide it, you know, and why not then find it in one as in both?"</p>
               <p>"It is not a question of argument," said Gardiner, "but of authority. What our
                  blessed Lord commanded to be done, Rome shall not forbid me to do. But as I have
                  your permission to officiate to-morrow, I will do so, and I'm much obliged to you
                  for calling."</p>
               <p>"Oh, not at all, not at all, I am engaged to-night at a <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >petit souper</foreign> at the Hotel de Russie, in the Piazza di Spagna, and
                  called in on my way. I fancy you had better see your ambassador to-morrow, or
                  Prince Torlonia,—he will arrange it for you. Good-night!" and he was gone.</p>
               <p>"I have done that," said Gardiner to Maurice; "I called on Mr. C——, our Charg. I
                  know some of his father's friends well, and he will attend to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"How very kind you are," said Maurice; "I never even thought of these things."</p>
               <p>"No! I knew you could not be expected to, and I would not put it upon you; but you
                  look pale; you have fasted quite long enough; go and get something at once, or you
                  will be ill."</p>
               <p>Maurice did indeed feel the want of food. It was long past the hour of the
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">table-d'hte.</foreign> He went listlessly out into the
                  night, and crossed the square Ito the restaurant of the Hotel de l'Europe, where
                  he had once dined with Frank. He ordered his meal and sat moodily down to it. A
                  party of young Americans came in, chatting aloud in the fresh spirits of youth.
                  They took the next table, and though his back was toward them, he could not help
                  hearing their talk.</p>
               <p>"See here, Bob," said one of the party, a young man with a dark moustache and
                  "garotte" collar, "why can't you go with us to Tivoli next Sunday?"</p>
               <p>"Don't ask him," broke in another; "he's engaged as <foreign xml:lang="ITA">primo
                     tenore</foreign> at the American Chapel."</p>
               <p>"What! has the fair Emily hooked him in so far as that? She's snatching a brand
                  from the burning, especially from such rips as you and me, Tom."</p>
               <p>"Why do you call him a brand? because he's a stick, and a black one at that?"</p>
               <p>"There, boys, that'll do; you can't sing and so can't shine. It pays, let me tell
                  you, for we have to rehearse all the<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7264-00000022"/>
                  week, and between finding the places and whispering about it in church-time, and
                  all that, I get through the long prayer nicely, and when the sermon comes I pull
                  out a novel. Then, after knocking about with you fellows all the week, it does a
                  man good to go to church."</p>
               <p>"So I should think," said the first speaker, "especially the novel part. How does
                  Miss E—— like that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, she don't care."</p>
               <p>"Don't she care? I rather think she does. I heard her tell you it was
                  shameful."</p>
               <p>"Well, I can't help that. I've religion enough to last half an hour; but by the
                  time we've done singing, mine sort of gives out. The sermon is a bore anyhow, and
                  I told her so the other day. Says I to her, 'If I do the pious half the time, you
                  ought to let me off from the other half.'"</p>
               <p>"Well," said a third, "give me the original old Church for my money. There you
                  have it seasoned to taste, much or little, hot and strong, or iced and mild, just
                  as, you happen to want it. There was that High Mass to-day in St. Peter's, three
                  mortal hours long; and yesterday morning I went in to the Military Mass in the
                  Trinit del Mont, where the nuns sing superbly, by the way, and I saw the French
                  officers come in. The scamps were just eight minutes at it, no longer than our
                  morning prayers at Old Harvard, and a precious sight more entertaining."</p>
               <p>A thin, bilious-looking Englishman, at the next table to Maurice, crossed himself
                  on hearing this irreverent speech.</p>
               <p>"For my part," said another, who had not spoken before, "I go to the English
                  Chapel, when I do go. There's some splendid women go there, and they say it's a
                  first-rate opening into English society, especially if you are up to the
                  High-Church game. There's a young parson I met the other day, out of whom I am
                  getting all the new dodges. Besides, it's the only respectable Church at home, and
                  a fellow must go to church there <emph>once</emph> a Sunday."</p>
               <p>"By thunder, I won't stand that," said the singer; "I'd like to know if the Dutch
                  Reformed isn't as good society as anything Episcopal. And when I play Catholic,
                  I'll have the real article, and no sham mosaic."</p>
               <p>Just then a new-comer entered, and came up to their table.</p>
               <p>"Boys," said he, "I've just left the consul's. There's a young American died
                  to-day at the Angleterre. F—— says we must all turn out and go to the
                  funeral."</p>
               <p>"Who is it?"</p>
               <p>"Where is he from?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, we ought, that's a fact; we must stand by the country."</p>
               <p>"I don't know," replied the other; "I have forgotten the name, that is"—</p>
               <p>Maurice rose and turned toward the group. "My classmate, Frank Goodstowe, of the
                  class of —— at Harvard, died to-day of consumption. He was," and here his voice
                  faltered, "my—my—very dear friend."</p>
               <p>There was first a hush, and then expressions of sympathy and inquiries, and
                  proffers of kindness, from all the good-humored, thoughtless young fellows. One
                  had met him. Others knew of him, and in a confused but hearty way each tried to
                  know something of his illness, and how best to show their good-will.</p>
               <p>Cards were exchanged, and promises to be present given.</p>
               <p>Maurice felt himself drawn, in spite of himself, by the tie of the mother-land,
                  nearer to these gay young men.</p>
               <p>The next evening he met them at the hotel. All were there, in decorous black and
                  with quiet demeanor, showing real reverence where they could be touched with a
                  reality. The American Minister and Consul came with their households, and some few
                  other Americans. The little procession moved quietly through the dusk to the
                  Protestant burial-ground, that spot where so many bright hopes have been quenched.
                  Far away from the inhabited part of the city, beside the Porta San Paolo, where
                  the pyramid of Caius Cestius looks down upon the graves of Shelly and Keats is the
                  little cemetery. Gardiner stood at the entrance as they alighted. The young
                  Americans took up the coffin as bearers, and Maurice followed as chief mourner,
                  with Luigi. Mrs. Gardiner and Miss De Forrest followed with the American Minister.
                  Two torch-bearers stood beside the open grave, as Gardiner, holding his
                  Prayer-Book, but not even glancing at it, began the beautiful burial-service. The
                  light streamed mildly upon the old walls of Rome, and the heavy masses of the
                  stone-pines and cypresses caught the flickering radiance. The group were silent
                  and deeply impressed; and when Gardiner, having<pb n="44-45"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000023"/> pronounced the solemn sentence of commitment,
                  began, "I heard a voice from heaven," Maurice glanced involuntarily upward, as if
                  to catch an answering echo from on high. The words sank deep into his heart, and
                  when in low murmurs some around him joined in the Lord's Prayer, he too, though
                  afraid to let a sound pass his lips, joined mentally therein with his whole
                  heart.</p>
               <p>When he reached the hotel again he found the American party lingering to bid him
                  good-night. There was a little constraint about them, as not knowing exactly what
                  to do or say; but one of them stayed behind the rest a moment and said,—"You will
                  find us at Nazari's, at breakfast, every morning at nine. When you feel like it,
                  join us, for you must be lonely."</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>IT was not the next morning nor the one after that Maurice availed himself of the
                  invitation. He preferred the quiet of the hotel and to steal off to the Coliseum
                  where he spent many hours, lounging with a book upon the ruined seats, musing over
                  many things, trying to shape his plans of life according to the glimpses he had
                  gained of a new light. He would have joined Gardiner's party at dinner, but it was
                  increased by one or two English clergymen, Oxford men, and with them ladies. The
                  talk was all of Newman, and Gladstone, and Mr. Ward, and the Bishop of Exeter, and
                  the Gorham case, which was pure Sanscrit to the young New Englander. So after a
                  week's solitary sight-seeing, one morning, instead of breakfasting at the hotel,
                  he strolled round into the Rear Piazza di Spagna to Nazari's, and according to
                  promise, found in one of the dingy inner rooms his new acquaintances. He wanted
                  company,—distraction,—he was barely twenty-three; he had come abroad to see all
                  that was to be seen. So he first faintly declined, and then accepted an invitation
                  to join in one of their excursions. Rome has them for many days, and ever new. It
                  is now the Vatican, then the Barberini palace, then the Corsini, then
                  Pamphili-Doria, or the fountain of Egeria, or the Baths of Caracalla, or to mount
                  to the ball of St. Peter's, or to he on one's back and study the Aurora of Guido
                  upon the ceiling of the Rospigliosi, or to go to see the Gladiator dying at the
                  Capitol, or to pass the day in modern studios, or to visit Overbeck in the grim
                  old Cenci palace by the Ghetto,—we are tired of cataloguing before we are half
                  through. Rome cannot wear out. The writer of this history, if he could put his
                  head into Fortunatus's wishing-cap, would unhesitatingly exclaim to be young again
                  and endlessly wintering in Rome.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7264-00000024"/>
               <p>So, to return, Maurice went with the party, it is no matter where, but to some one
                  of these, and dined with them at the Europa afterwards, and agreed to make one in
                  an expedition to see the Vatican Gallery of Sculpture by torchlight. The start was
                  to be at the Hotel de Russie, where were ladies to meet, Americans all, and
                  Maurice was presented and made at home, as it used to be in the good old times
                  before it mattered from what part of the land a man came, so he only swore by the
                  Stars and Stripes. He found himself paired off with a fair Bostonian, whom the
                  others fought shy of as a "blue." By the time they reached the gallery, Maurice
                  and she had got through with that preliminary fire of desultory talk by which we
                  ascertain one another's position before opening in earnest. He was rather pleased
                  at finding himself not mated with one of the chatty little New York belles, of
                  whose smiles his friends were so emulous. So he hit off rather dashingly one or
                  two of the Harvard celebrities, and on her side the look of polite sufferance was
                  exchanged for one of decided attention. Thus it happened that she accepted his arm
                  at the entrance of that long corridor which introduces us to the greater treasury
                  beyond. By torchlight views there is no lingering over the inscriptions and rude
                  intaglios from the early Christian tombs which line the walls of the corridor. We
                  go only to see the chief gems of the collection. As they paced together up the
                  long hall, Maurice, who had seen just this first portion and no more, was inclined
                  to talk about them, and especially to air his new-made discovery of an early
                  Christian church existing in Rome. The lady listened politely, but evidently had
                  no sympathy with art so archaic and unclassical as the rude crosses and palms from
                  the tombs of Rome's serfs and outlaws, princes though they might be in the kingdom
                  which is eternal. However, all discussion of this ceased as the torch-bearers
                  stopped before the magnificent head of the young Augustus, that superb sculptural
                  prophecy of the first Napoleon. The show began here, and Maurice, who had read
                  Arnold, and was rather well up in his Roman history, regained his lost ground by
                  the spirit of his criticism upon the founder of Roman Imperialism.</p>
               <p>The effect of torchlight upon the Vatican sculpture is indeed marvellous. The
                  marble seems to swell and heave in the tremulous rays. Especially as they gazed
                  upon the Laocoon, the serpents appeared to be actually gliding around the smooth
                  limbs of the boys, and the rugged features of Neptune's priest seemed to tighten
                  with the spasm of a living agony. One of the ladies uttered a half-suppressed cry
                  of terror, and Maurice felt the hand upon his arm tremble. They ended with the
                  Apollo Cabinet. The fair Laura, Maurice's companion, was in ecstasies. She was in
                  her element. She showed a critical knowledge of anatomy that was startling in its
                  correctness. She quoted Miss Fuller and Emerson, and then advanced an, opinion
                  that such nobility of art could only be attained again when culture should have
                  opened the wider fields of Grecian life once more to us. "To the pure all things
                  are pure, to the refined all things are ideal. We need to break away from sinful
                  compliances with the absurd legend of a fall of humanity, the fable of priesthood.
                  The beautiful is the true and the pure. The Greeks were as noble as we are, and
                  their art did not shrink from its legitimate results." The young men around were
                  listening. Maurice felt his cheek grow hot as he caught the expression upon one or
                  two of their faces, but the young pythoness of art did not notice it.</p>
               <p>"No," she continued, "we do not hide the ideal of form in the brute, why then in
                  man? When the true religion, which is the worship of nature, is perfected, we
                  shall be able to have faith in humanity."</p>
               <p>Happily the torches were lowered at the close of the regulation ten minutes, and
                  the lecture came to a pause. Maurice felt at liberty after that to study a little
                  more closely nature in the face of this new hierophant of its creed.</p>
               <p>Laura Sedley was undoubtedly beautiful. She had clear-cut features, with dark
                  eyes, which look straight and unshrinkingly at you; a fine mouth, with rather thin
                  lips, and with black hair brushed back from a very intellectual forehead. There
                  was a thorough <emph>aplomb</emph> in her manner which made her seem quite
                  matronly to the young man, but there was nothing in it of self-consciousness, no
                  appealing softness of word or look. She was simply expressing certain
                  well-pondered decisions in a pure philosophical way.</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7264-00000025"/>
               <p>"Oh," said she, as they left the cabinet, "I could have worshipped Apollo."</p>
               <p>"Can't you now?" said Maurice.</p>
               <p>"What! the deification of the sun, a simple planetary unit amid the myriad
                  millions of the Via Lactea?"</p>
               <p>"Well, fair Hypatia" (Kingsley's book was just out and everybody reading and
                  talking about it), "can you not idealize?"</p>
               <p>"Please don't call me Hypatia, I have no patience with the woman, she was no true
                  philosopher; how could she be with the absurd science of her day? She cared for
                  the worn-out prettinesses of old paganism, just as some of my schoolmates, girls
                  who belong to St. Polycarp's Church in Boston, do about their High Church
                  playthings. It is all very pretty, like little girls sitting with their dollies,
                  playing tea-party. For my part, I always wanted to cut my dolls open, to see what
                  they were stuffed with;—no, give me science and art."</p>
               <p>"But art must have art's inspiration."</p>
               <p>"That is nonsense, you must have art-knowledge. Zeuxis flung his sponge at the
                  dog's head on his canvas and made the foam flecking its mouth; and so what calls
                  itself inspiration dashes at its work, hit or miss, and now and then makes a
                  success. What of it? It does not gain a real induction. Inspiration, genius, are
                  but the silly world's synonymes for luck, in its gambling ventures upon the great
                  Rouge-et-Noir table where Nature keeps the bank; <emph>We know</emph> that your
                  rule of chances is reducible to the perfect mathematic."</p>
               <p>"Who are 'we'?" said Maurice.</p>
               <p>"We Compteists, disciples of the Philosophic Positive."</p>
               <p>"Then you cannot worship Apollo, because you can make another as good as the
                  Belvidere."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, if it were worth while, with time and pains enough. The Apollo is
                  constructive, but man prefers to make something else."</p>
               <p>"Miss Sedley," said Maurice, taking her hand and holding it up to the light of the
                  moonbeam (they were now crossing the court-yard of the Vatican)—"Miss Sedley, your
                  diamond is simply a crystal of charcoal; or carbon, I suppose I ought to say; make
                  me a hatful of diamonds and I will think of becoming a convert to Positivism."</p>
               <p>She withdrew her hand from his and also dropped it from his arm, with a slight
                  maidenly gesture of offended dignity.</p>
               <p>She is less positive than she professes, thought the young man, having rightly
                  interpreted her movement.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Miss Sedley," said he, "I forgot I was talking to a lady, and used a
                  freedom only allowable toward a <emph>brother</emph> philosopher."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you young men," she replied, "Pendennises all, sneering at everything and
                  doing nought."</p>
               <p>"Well, what does the Philosophy of Positivism bid us do? All knowledge is the
                  same, except for the distinction of motive. We push our investigation into the
                  arcana of wines and dinners, which are equally alluring with chemistry and
                  botany."</p>
               <p>"Do not trifle, Mr. Maurice," said she impatiently, "you have some brains; you are
                  not like R—— and F—— here, mere sticks and dawdles,—I see you can reason."</p>
               <p>"I am sadly in earnest, Miss Sedley," said he, flashing lip into the remembrance
                  of what was most upon his mind, "I am sincerely waiting to be taught, and I am
                  sure that one question lies at the root of all teaching, 'What am I here for?'
                  Rome would gladly answer that question for me, I see, if I will only shut my eyes
                  and put my hand into hers. She has a key, she says, to the mystery of the future
                  life, but I am not yet ready for self-surrender. I am eclectic, enough, goodness
                  knows, but one must have a motive."</p>
               <p>"Love of science for science's sake."</p>
               <p>"Please distinguish—What is science? what right has knowledge in any branch to
                  arrogate to itself that title, if all lead to nothing? As Emerson says, 'what do I
                  know about rats, or the private life of lizards in the wall?' I can go out and
                  study that all day here upon the aqueducts. Why not as well to study the stars?
                  Suppose I exhaust all knowledge, becoming the last man and heir of the Ages; when
                  I gain the ultimate fact, what shall it profit me?"</p>
               <p>"Do you mean, 'what shall it profit you if you gain the whole world and lose your
                  own soul?' Don't inflict that horror upon me. I became a Compteist as much to get
                  away from that stuff as for any other reason."</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7264-00000026"/>
               <p>"No, I did not mean it, though as I am not yet converted to Positivism, there may
                  be something in that; I meant just what I said."</p>
               <p>She paused. Her former question had been but fencing to gain time. Maurice was
                  looking deeper into these questions than she had ever done. Faith was wakening in,
                  his soul, while on hers was resting the satisfied slumber of skepticism. She only
                  half liked this disturbing process.</p>
               <p>"Ah," she said, "wait till the ultimate fact be found; you will have enough to do
                  before that. Meanwhile, here is your problem, sir; take the work of Compte and
                  Buckle; give us the new religion. With the perfect knowledge will come the perfect
                  happiness. Ignorance and sin are the same. Did we know how to live and be happy
                  forever, we should live and be happy forever. When you do this you will be the
                  Prophet of the New Religion. We will worship you. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Tu
                     Magnus Apollo eris!</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"But, my dear lady, do you not know that the more knowledge increases, on the more
                  points it touches the unknown? If ignorance and sin are the same, the more we know
                  the more we are likely to sin, for aught I see,—at any rate to be unhappy. I can't
                  wait for this ultimate fact to be gained." "However," added he, "to be Apollo
                     <emph>is</emph> a temptation. Do me the favor provisionally to burn a little
                  incense to me, and hang a garland on my head now. I will take the hecatomb when my
                  work is done. Apollo is lazy, also bred in New England, and likes to get earnest
                  of his wages before he undertakes the job. And now, fair Dian, since you will not
                  let me call you Hypatia, here is your carriage. Permit me to hand you in. I am
                  going to commence my studies forthwith by an examination of the laws of
                  combustion, as Sheldon here is doing," She hardly bade him good-night, she was so
                  provoked at the turn of persiflage with which he had ended his talk. Bryan passed
                  his arm into that of Sheldon, the young man who, on the night of their first
                  meeting, was in favor of having the genuine old Church, and no shams, if one must
                  have a Church. Laura Sedley threw herself back in the carriage, and refused to
                  join in the rattle of the others, but kept repeating to herself over and over the
                  words,—"ultimate fact." They were a terrible stumbling-block. Hers had been the
                  ideal side of Positivism—she had not before seen its Epicurean aspect. Of course
                  it shocked her, but she could not drive it away.</p>
               <p>To the readers of this story who live, or rather belong west of the Hudson River,
                  these young people may seem a very exaggerated caricature. To the Eastern portion
                  of the critics no apology or explanation is due. There is but one Boston, and
                  Harvard is its university.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Bryan was sauntering with his companion across the magnificent piazza.
                  Unobserved by them, the same Englishman who had crossed himself in the caf of the
                  Hotel d'Europe at the silly speech of one of these young Americans, came out of a
                  side-door in the Vatican and followed them. The young men stopped beside one of
                  the fountains to look at St. Peter's. The Englishman followed, and watched them
                  from behind.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Maurice," said Sheldon, "I've been thinking over this Catholic matter. I like
                  it. I joke about it with the fellows here, but there's more in it than just fancy.
                  I have been studying these monuments up here in the gallery. There was a Church
                  here in St. Paul's time,—there has been ever since. They have been going straight
                  along from the start. Some things they have added, no doubt, but they can't have
                  changed them so much, you know. Why are they not as near right as our folks at
                  home with their great square meeting-houses and all preach, preach, preach? Now
                  this St. Peter's is something like what we read about in the Bible—Solomon's
                  Temple and all that. At any rate, if a fellow is to have any religion, as I
                  suppose a fellow must, this is thorough-going. I like going to confession and
                  getting pardoned off. A man leads a wild racketing kind of a life here,—he don't
                  mean any harm by it, but he can't very well help it, or pull up short if he wants
                  to. When one has been spreeing it rather hard and got sick, then to whiff round
                  and experience religion and turn Methodist, because he is played out, seems to me
                     <emph>spooney.</emph> It's like a horse when he can't win the race turning
                  jackass and dragging a sand-cart. But then one hates to think of slipping off the
                  hooks after a wild time with Belmont and Tom King, and those boys. The safest way,
                     <emph>I</emph> think, is to hedge on religion, even if you bet large on the
                  good time generally. You can do that in the Old Church. She says, Pay as you
                     go.<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7264-00000027"/> While in our shop it's just run
                  up—no end of a tick, and then have the bill come in when you least expect it."</p>
               <p>Maurice was rather confounded by this patent Roman cement for broken resolutions.
                  Amused, too, by its frankness, but he could not answer it. Was it not just
                  coarsely stating what he vas secretly longing for? He, too, wanted a religion
                  which would bear softly on the pleasures of the world. He wanted a creed which was
                  not followed by any decalogue. So he could not answer Sheldon, but stood there
                  looking at the moonbeam in the fountain basin, and sucking at his cigar as if to
                  draw from it a smoky solution. He remembered Frank sleeping under the cypresses
                  there away, and wondered if <emph>he</emph> had experienced religion because he
                  found himself consumptive. It did not sit badly on Frank at any rate. He gave a
                  sigh and turned to go. Just then a voice close by made, both of them start.</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen, but did either of you drop a letter?" it said. They
                  looked round and the sallow Englishman stood beside them. Sheldon felt in his
                  pockets. The letter was lying at Maurice's feet, but on the other side from the
                  speaker. Maurice took it up. To his surprise it bore his name. He opened it. It
                  contained only a line,—"You seek truth and peace. Be to-morrow at noon, at the
                  Church of the Gesu."</p>
               <p>"This is certainly for me," said Maurice, "but how came it here? Did you——?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, by no means. I was just crossing the square and saw it lying on the
                  ground. I recognized your friend for an American, and so I ventured to speak,
                  Which I should hardly have done with one of my own countrymen; but I have been in
                  the States and learned how to be polite at the expense of reserve." Maurice
                  thanked him, and then the stranger added, "Will you direct me to the Piazza di
                  Spagna. I am a stranger in Home, only came two days ago from Civita Vecchia, and
                  have not learned my way."</p>
               <p>"Oh, certainly," said Sheldon. "Come with us—we are going there—take a cigar?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you—I don't mind," said he, taking it, but not lighting it. Maurice turned
                  to give another look at St. Peter's.</p>
               <p>"Say what you please," he broke out, "it is the grandest temple in
                  Christendom,—not but what I like the Gothic cathedrals better—but this is so
                  grand."</p>
               <p>"I say," said the Englishman, "you both are Protestants I suppose—all Americans
                  are. Now I'm an English Catholic. I dare say you wouldn't mind telling one how
                  this sort of thing you see here strikes you. I'd like much an intelligent
                  Protestant's impressions. In England there is so much party-spirit in us all that
                  you can't get a civiller word than scarlet woman of Babylon from them—but in
                  America you are more liberal. I'm told your Lord High Chancellor, or Chief Justice
                  of the President's Bench—or something of the sort, is a Catholic—in fact the
                  President himself might be—mightn't he?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Maurice, "I believe you're right. Judge Taney is a Roman
                  Catholic."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, come, tell us how this strikes you. I can't say I exactly like it. Of
                  course, I must stick by Old Mother Church, but at home it is very different, There
                  we Catholics are the old gentry—old Stuart men. We look down upon those upstarts
                  who got rich when Henry plundered the monasteries, and the fellows who had army
                  contracts under the Georges—we, who can trace back to the Conquest, and find our
                  names in the Doomsday-Book. I can tell you we're not all priests and beggars, as
                  they are here. A priest is a priest, of course; but unless he's a gentleman and
                  comes of a good family, you keep him at a distance, except just for his duties,
                  and he knows his place. But here it is just My Lord, and hats off to every Irish
                  vagabond out of Maynooth. Then there's so much stuff to believe. Of course I like
                  a picture over the high altar in my church. So do some of your Protestants—the
                  sensible ones I mean—but I can't stand its winking at me. It won't do—that sort of
                  thing gives Exeter Hall a terrible pull over us. Now say out what you think; you
                  won't offend me. If I'm right, I ought not to care, and if I'm wrong, why it's
                  only fair to tell me so. Honestly, now, don't you think it overdone?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Maurice, "not if it is sincere."</p>
               <p>"Oh, well, you know, but how can it be? Anything in reason; but if I am to fee
                  crossing myself this way every time I come to one of these, (he suited the action
                  to the word as they came beneath a lamp burning before a shrine<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000028"/> with the Madonna and Child at a street corner,) I
                  shall be tired enough before I get home. Not that I like to see a man stop and
                  light his cigar at these, as I saw one of your countrymen try to do at Malta. No
                  more would you."</p>
               <p>"Frankly," said Maurice, "I would like to believe it all—one must believe
                  something. It is so comfortable to believe."</p>
               <p>"There's just where I wonder at you. I was born to it, and I should as soon think
                  of denying that I'm a Lancashire man as my religion, or selling the old place at
                  home, that came into our family in Edward IV.'s time. It is a point of honor to
                  take it all—the hard and the easy—but if I were quit of it, as you are, I would
                  look twice before I leaped. I'm born a subject of her Gracious Majesty, but if I
                  were not, do you think I would emigrate from America to England?"</p>
               <p>The contrast between the off-hand manner and bluff good nature of the speaker and
                  his appearance was very striking. Thin, with rigid features, close-cut attire of
                  deep black, quite like an English dissenting minister, he talked like a hearty,
                  broad-shouldered English squire.</p>
               <p>"No," he continued, "I don't want to make proselytes, or to see any made; and when
                  I see young fellows like you, whom all this show and pomp will strike, looking
                  toward the Old Church, I like to give you a fair warning. When you're in, you'll
                  stay in. Our people have a knack of keeping fast hold upon their converts, and
                  when you have once given up to a priest, you're like a well-broke colt—you like
                  the stable best. We find belief come easy, we are trained to it; but you can keep
                  a doubting and asking questions, and trying to find something to suit you. I dare
                  say it's very nice, or so many of you wouldn't do it. And then there's this thing:
                  our Church is always open, when a man does want rest, and authority, and all
                  that—and we let in a man at the last moment."</p>
               <p>The young men were silent. No panegyric of Romanism would have had half the power
                  of this seeming dissuasive. There is no idea to an American with so much of hidden
                  fascination in it as that of belonging to the Old World. Here was a man without
                  prejudices apparently, who saw the faults of his own Church, yet stuck to it.</p>
               <p>"See here," said Sheldon, "I have a mind to know something thing more about your
                  Church, and I wish I had some good fellow, who don't care, as you say, about
                  converting me, to tell me about it—to give me a fair chance to know what is what.
                  Dine with me to-morrow at the Europa, and we'll have a quiet talk—at six—if that
                  suits you?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm game," said the Englishman, and he gave Sheldon his card. "Ah," said
                  he, "here we are at the Piazza di Spagna. Many thanks for your kindness,
                  gentlemen!" and he turned and left them. They walked back toward the Angleterre
                  where Maurice was to stop—but had they watched they might have seen their late
                  companion, after pausing a second to make sure that he was not watched, pass on
                  with a swift steady step to the gate of the Propaganda, summon the porter by the
                  bell, and respond as he went in to the deep reverence of that official by a brief
                  authoritative gesture of benediction.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>THE next morning Bryan remembered his mysterious letter and the appointment it
                  contained. He looked at it again. It bore, as was said, only the words, "You seek
                  truth and peace. Be to-morrow at noon at the Church of the Gsu." But at the end,
                  and in ink of a fainter hue, as if written in some sort of sympathetic fluid,
                  which had come out from time or warmth, was this reference: "St. John, chap. i. v.
                  48." Maurice caught up his Bible and looked out the text. It startled him
                  exceedingly. He fixed upon first one and then another of two or three
                  circumstances as the one alluded to, but could not determine, and, as it proved,
                  was quite astray in all. He breakfasted at the hotel, hoping to meet Gardiner, but
                  did not; then went to the Pamphili-Doria Palace, to see that famous gallery of
                  pictures. Still he kept nervously looking at his watch, and full ten minutes
                  before the time he stood upon the steps of the Gsu. Once within the lofty church,
                  he wandered round it with the shy, loitering step which we Americans generally
                  assume in foreign places of worship; neither wholly recognizing nor wholly
                  ignoring the sacred character of the place. Your genuine English Protestant would,
                  if permitted, climb the high altar itself, Murray in hand, to see a famous
                  picture; while the worshippers come in, kneel, and rise up again in a thorough
                  business-like and wholly at-home way. He found himself at length in front of the
                  main altar, looking up at the huge globe of <foreign xml:lang="LAT">lapis
                     lazuli</foreign> above the Baldachino. A flock of little Jesuits, led by two
                  large ones, came in, went down on their knees simultaneously, and jumped up again
                  and went their way. Maurice was reminded of a flock of crows lighting, as he had
                  often seen them on the salt marshes of his home. He was about to follow them away,
                  the half-ludicrous idea having fallen like a damper on the excited mood with which
                  he had come to the church, when a tall gray-haired man, with a lofty and striking
                  face, and clad in a long black cassock, having a dark purple cape above it, stood
                  beside him.</p>
               <p>"You are welcome, Sir," he said in English; "I felt sure you would come. Pray step
                  this way, where we may converse without disturbance to others."</p>
               <p>He led the way to the sacristy, where he seated himself in a confessional,
                  pointing Maurice however to a seat in front of him. Then he was silent. Maurice
                  felt embarrassment gaining upon him, and, to relieve it, broke the silence, just
                  as the other expected that he would do.</p>
               <p>"You sent for me to come here to-day. Why?"</p>
               <p>"Because of the reason why you, thus sent for, came. Another would have taken no
                  heed of it."</p>
               <p>"But how did you know that reason? I hardly know of it myself."</p>
               <p>"The patient does not question the physician as to how he knows him to be ill, he
                  asks for the remedy."</p>
               <p>"Can you give me a remedy?"</p>
               <p>"I can."</p>
               <p>"Let it be so; but first prove yourself to be the physician."</p>
               <p>"You are an American, and take nothing and yet all things for granted. We can
                  afford to be indulgent. Do you remember the little church at Stertzing, in the
                  Tyrol?"</p>
               <p>Maurice started. He did remember it; and that then was the key to the mysterious
                  allusion of the text in the letter. He had strolled into it while his horses were
                  resting, and while his mind, deeply moved with the spells which Romanism weaves in
                  that land—the most perilous of all to a Protestant of doubtful faith—was in a most
                  unsettled state. He had found the church empty, though open, had crossed himself
                  from the benitoir, and then knelt before the little altar, looking, not upon its
                  tawdriness, but above it to the rude and painful figure upon the cross, and had
                  prayed aloud for light and guidance. Of course, as a young New-England Unitarian,
                  no thought of adoration to the figure, since not even one of worship to the Being
                  whom it presented passed his mind, but he had done so with a vague longing to
                  enter into the simple religious<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7264-00000030"/> spirit of
                  the mountaineers, whose faith and nobleness of life he had so learned to admire
                  and love. He had met the cur coming to the church as he left it, and had half
                  resolved to turn back and question him, but shame-facedness withheld him. He felt
                  sure that no one else could have witnessed his act; in fact, with that true New
                  England mixture of caution and enthusiasm, he had examined the little church
                  closely, to be certain of his solitude, as soon as he rose from his knees.</p>
               <p>"Yes, father, I do remember," said Maurice; "but you? were you there?"</p>
               <p>"I never have been north of Milan, my son. I have not been outside of Rome for
                  three years. Can you not believe that your prayer was heard?"</p>
               <p>For one moment Maurice was ready to say yes. The perfect self-possession of the
                  ecclesiastic showed him that this was not a chance knowledge adroitly used, but
                  that far more was known to him than he chose to reveal. A faint smile played about
                  his firm, handsome mouth, marking a full conviction of power.</p>
               <p>"Nay, more, my son; you fancied, did you not, that my letter, for it was mine,
                  referred to what you did at Bologna a fortnight since, or to what you did six days
                  ago here in Rome?"</p>
               <p>Maurice was now fairly bewildered. That leaning toward the marvellous we all have,
                  for a second or two fairly mastered him, and then the old native shrewdness came
                  back to his aid. It was all a trick, he thought, clever, inexplicable, but still a
                  trick. Before he could speak, however, the priest, reading all the inward
                  movements of the mind in his face, according to the wonderful skill of his order,
                  said,—</p>
               <p>"Pardon me! Do not think that I hold this to give me any claim upon your
                  attention. Such a plot as you suspect might do for a dull or a shallow brain. I
                  may not tell you <emph>how</emph> I know these things, that is, or rather is not,
                     <emph>my</emph> secret; but I am aware that you must see there is a natural
                  explanation simple enough to one who has the key. We do not need to work false
                  miracles to win souls. The mighty mother only desires to prove her love. Does it
                  show no care, no tenderness that you have been so sought for? The eye which saw
                  your involuntary homage, knew that you were no child of the Church. At the first
                  intimation on your part that you were seeking the fold, yearning love goes out to
                  meet you. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Cum autem adhuc longe esset, vidit illum pater
                     ipsius et misericordia motus est, et occurrens cecidit super collum ejus et
                     osculatus est eum.</foreign> That love, you see, has never lost sight of you,
                  but has watched and led you here. How many hours after that prayer of yours, think
                  you, was it that the Mass was offered on yonder altar for <emph>your</emph>
                  conversion? Not generally as for any heretic, but for <emph>you.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Maurice was really moved. The artful appeal to his feelings put his reason to
                  sleep.</p>
               <p>"Yet, father," said he, "what would you have me do?"</p>
               <p>"Accept that thou seekest, my son."</p>
               <p>"Tell me first, for that is my chiefest trouble, what that is." And ere the priest
                  could reply, Maurice went on: "Do not ask me to seek to save my soul; that I
                  cannot stand. You all, Protestants and Catholics, alike are harping upon that—a
                  spiritual selfishness that leads us to look out for number one. You each profess
                  to represent the only genuine insurance company for heaven. And your only object
                  is to get us to pay you the premium instead of to your rivals."</p>
               <p>"My son, look around you and ask yourself what the Catholic Church has to gain by
                  a single convert. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Nonne dimittit nonaginta novem in
                     deserto et vadit ad illam, qu perierat donec inveniat eam?</foreign> I do not
                  ask you to care for saving your soul. You may find some day that your soul is of
                  value; but that is our not your motive It is that you come back to the mother's
                  bosom, the mother whose love and care I have been proving. Come and prove your
                  love by service, not such service as the so-called churches of the world exact,
                  which gold and silver measure, but such as they know not of—prayers for quick and
                  dead, adoration for her beatified servants, whom she delights to have honored;
                  meditations, such as true affection delights in, upon her glorious career as the
                  spotless Bride. Yes, my son, like the true mother in the wise judgment of Solomon,
                  she would rather have you hers thus in spirit, though another possessed your body
                  and the title of mother, than divide with any the dead possession. Continue, if
                  you will, Protestant<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7264-00000031"/> testant in name, in
                  acts of outward membership, but give to the Church your soul's affection, your
                  real allegiance."</p>
               <p>The appeal was made with consummate skill. Its lofty, tone touched the heart of
                  one very keen to detect the first symptoms of selfishness, and who had been
                  repelled from all religion by the manifest faults and sectarianism of the
                  religious. The father added, after a moment's silence,—</p>
               <p>"Go, my son; you now know why you have been sought. The race of God in your own
                  heart can alone make it effectual. If you want me, ask here for Father Francesco,
                  the American priest! If you should be ill, night or day, I will come to you; send
                  this card [giving him one] to this church, by any Italian."</p>
               <p>Maurice rose to go.</p>
               <p>"Can you not," he said, "give me something to read upon the matter? I am very
                  ignorant."</p>
               <p>"Certainly; here is a list of works, and an order to admit you to the library of
                  the Propaganda, prepared in expectation of this interview. You see we know your
                  wants, and have the best robe and the ring of gold ready. We shall yet kill for
                  you the fatted calf."</p>
               <p>They left the sacristy. Maurice held out his hand in farewell. The priest did not
                  take it, but laid his own gently on Maurice's shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Have you forgotten," he said, while a sad sweet smile came over his face, "have
                  you forgotten what is better than books?"</p>
               <p>He pointed to the rail of the altar. The church was empty of worshippers, as it
                  was the hour of noon, when the Roman churches are generally closed. Maurice knelt
                  there, unable at first, for tears, to command his thoughts; then he prayed long
                  and fervently. When he rose the priest stood over him in the act of benediction.
                  Maurice left the church silently, a watchful and quiet acolyte opening for him a
                  wicket-door in the great portal. As he looked back he saw the priest bowed to the
                  pavement in absorbed devotion, and felt in his heart that the father was praying
                  for him.</p>
               <p>Maurice spent the next week much in the Propaganda library. In one thing, however,
                  his mentor had failed. He had not suspected the depth of ignorance of Christian
                  history, and of the leading doctrines of the faith under which the neophyte really
                  labored. Many of the noblest arguments glanced off from him harmless, like sharp
                  icicles from the tortoise's shell. He was bewildered, as by a gorgeous vision of
                  the great Church in the early Centuries, but he Could not seize the vital point of
                  her life in the Christian verities. So a cold fit followed the fever, and it
                  occurred to him with characteristic Yankee caution, to apply not to the Jesuit
                  father but to Gardiner, for an explanation of what these dim phantoms meant. His
                  thorough Unitarian saved I him from the really strong point of Dome's appeal—her
                  guardianship of the orthodoxy of the creeds,—as his Puritanism prevented him from
                  appreciating the fact of her unbroken orders. So he thought he would take his
                  perplexities to the Anglican minister. If his solution confirmed his own
                  half-formed impressions, (as he had always been told that Episcopalianism was
                  halfway to Rome,) it would be the testimony of a hostile witness, and therefore to
                  be trusted; if it did not, why the matter was where it was before.</p>
               <p>So he waited his opportunity and caught the clergyman one evening after the five
                  o'clock <foreign xml:lang="FRA">table d'hte.</foreign> He rushed at once into the
                  subject. "Mr. Gardiner, may I ask you a question about religion,—about the
                  Church?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, any number. Come up to my room and we will take our leisure; just let
                  me get a cigar and take one for yourself, and then we shall talk freely."</p>
               <p>As they took their places, Maurice standing before the fire-place, and the
                  clergyman comfortably stretched out hi a large arm-chair, Maurice began,—</p>
               <p>"Why do you say that when a good man dies, he goes straight to heaven, when the
                  Scripture says he does not?"</p>
               <p>"What does the Scripture say?" said Gardiner.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Hodie in Paradise cum me eris,</foreign>" said Maurice,
                  unconsciously quoting from the Vulgate. He had fired a prepared mine from one of
                  the books of Romish controversy, dug with wondrous pains against Protestantism, as
                  understood by Jesuit writers of the third class.</p>
               <p>"We don't say that any man goes straight to heaven, though your new friends, the
                  Romanists, say that the beatified saints do. We say that the dead enter the
                  intermediate state, there to await the last judgment, when soul and body are
                  reunited." Maurice colored at the allusion to his "new<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000032"/> friends." "You have been dipping, I see, into the
                  Romish controversy, and that shot came out of a familiar arsenal of the enemy; you
                  perceive it did not hit <emph>me</emph> at all. Had I been an ultra-Protestant, it
                  might have, and I should have been forced to declaim against Purgatory to cover my
                  retreat. As it is, I can fall back upon St. Paul, and bid you read over the Burial
                  Service. Did the Father tell you, or did any of the books he bid you read tell you
                  that the English version was full of errors, and so that you had better go to the
                  original Latin?"</p>
               <p>"Something of the sort."</p>
               <p>"He might have intimated that St. Luke wrote in Greek, if he had been really
                  anxious you should go to the fountain-head. Who is your spiritual director? N——,
                  or F——, or W——?"</p>
               <p>"How do you know I have a spiritual director?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, that is plain enough. Did he present himself to you in some startling way, or
                  did you go to him of your own accord?"</p>
               <p>Maurice told the whole story, which, of course, we need not repeat, nor Gardiner's
                  few but well-put questions, which brought out the whole thing into plain relief
                  before Bryan's mind. When the account was ended, Gardiner paused a moment,
                  thoughtfully—</p>
               <p>"I think I have it," he said, at last. "Was it intimated to you that you could
                  dispense with an open profession, only giving your secret allegiance to the
                  Church?"</p>
               <p>Maurice started. "Why, yes," said he. "I did not look at it in that light, but
                  something of the sort was certainly said."</p>
               <p>"No, of course you did not, but that was the way of it. They try that on
                  New-England men. They are not anxious to get avowed conversions, the shrewder
                  sort. The vulgar Irish priests like to make a great hurrah over a proselyte from a
                  good family, but the wiser heads know that at home an open secession ends a man's
                  true influence in New-England. They want to set a secret leaven at work—in
                  Colleges and among the leading circles. But I think I know how you were got hold
                  of. You were in the Tyrol in September last, you say. A Boston lady, who was then
                  on her road, spiritually as well as corporeally, to Rome, came by that route from
                  Vienna—has been here ever since, and has become a zealous disciple. She must have
                  seen you there, and being in the same state of mind as yourself, read at a glance
                  all that was working in your thoughts. She has told the Father of it. She knew you
                  were a Harvard Unitarian when you left home, for she was then one herself. I
                  think, from what you have before told me of our friends in Boston, that she knows
                  you personally, at least by sight. Your name and all that she could tell of you
                  were entered upon the books of the Propaganda. When you reached here, your
                  arrival, like that of every other traveller, was notified to them by the passport
                  officials. They have your pasport, and by the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >viss</foreign> could trace your route. You say you met an English gentleman at
                  Bologna; went with him to the Campo Santo, and afterwards called with him at a
                  (Convent to see a young friend of his there. He was a papal agent, not on the
                  watch for you, but for any fish floundering in the sea of doubt. He learned your
                  name and sent in his report—all in the line of his work—He head-quarters, where it
                  was filed with the rest. They are wonderfully systematic here in Rome. The Roman
                  incident you speak of I have no clue to, but it was in some similar way known.
                  Mother Church had never troubled her loving heart about you till she found you
                  ready to her hand; then the affair was reckoned up and placed in the hands of
                  Father W——, a deserter from our own communion, whom I knew well, and he, I
                  suspect, planned it. The letter so adroitly dropped by B——, an English Jesuit, who
                  has hopes of one of the new bishoprics they are plotting in England—I know him
                  too—was very like one of Father W——'s devices."</p>
               <p>Maurice sat still; he had taken his place on the sofa quite disenchanted. "What
                  had I best do?" he said doubtfully.</p>
               <p>"You had best make up your mind what you want to do. I am sure I would not have
                  you turn Papist, and indeed I don't much fear it, but you had better even do that
                  than continue unbelieving. You have first to consider whether you can be a
                  religious man. What you are thus far trying, is to escape being a Christian by
                  becoming a Roman Catholic. When you have determined on being a Christian, I think
                  I can, by God's grace, help you to become so; but you must first realize the fact
                  of the need of salvation.<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7264-00000033"/> I don't mean
                  from the consequences, but from the <emph>fact</emph> of sin—the sin itself."</p>
               <p>"What <emph>is</emph> sin?" said Maurice.</p>
               <p>"My dear young friend, that is a question you must ask and answer of yourself.
                  Holy Scripture can teach you, and prayer. Do the will and you shall know of the
                  doctrine."</p>
               <p>"I will certainly think of the matter," said Maurice, "but I cannot go on in this
                  way with the priest any longer."</p>
               <p>"No; certainly not; of course not."</p>
               <p>"But something I must do."</p>
               <p>"Well, do this. You want in the first place to find, at least in your present
                  state, somewhere to go for guidance."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is it. But I can't accept the Bible, much less study it, as you say,
                  unless I know what to think of it. I want its true place in history. Rome here has
                  professed to give me that, but by putting it altogether to one side. She offers me
                  a Church autocratic, not inspired, but of itself infallible. Now history will not
                  let me believe that. My New-England teachers offered me a Bible infallible, but
                  yet I was to get its meaning according to my own lights. Parker and the rest have
                  told me that it has a meaning all <unclear>hidden</unclear> under a cloud of
                  mistakes—that there is a grain of wheat buried under heaps of chaff. I think I
                  should like a Church with the Bible in its hand—for somehow I have come to see
                  that there is a Church somewhere, and I cannot feel that the Bible is just an
                  ordinary book."</p>
               <p>"That precisely the right position," said the clergyman. "You want a body of men
                  organized in a common faith, allegiance to a person, to be the fit recipients of a
                  revelation committed to enduring records. That body are the founders of a society
                  which shall keep and transmit those records—the two indissolubly bound together as
                  the Nation and the Constitution. Their association must of necessity be, not from
                  accident of choice but from ordination. The body exists organic and entire before
                  the record is made. St. Matthew and St. John were made Apostles of the Lord before
                  a line of their gospels was written. Now this society must be continuous or it
                  loses its hold upon the revelation."</p>
               <p>"There I differ," said Maurice, now roused in argument. "We have the Greek
                  writers, Homer, Plato, Demosthenes, &amp;c., but we are not Greeks, nor has the
                  Greek Commonwealth survived."</p>
               <p>"No, but the human race has, and we are men. But that is not the point. We are not
                  seeking the fact of the preservation of the Scripture revelation, but its
                  authority. Those writers you spoke of stand on their own merits, and for them
                  their existence is enough. The Bible, to be an <emph>authority,</emph> requires a
                  continuous witness. Its merits—and here is your New-England fallacy in failing to
                  see that you receive it unknowingly upon the witness of the Church Catholic which
                  you ignore—depend, you say, upon your spirit of receiving it. On the contrary,
                  your impressions of it are the consentient warrant of your reception of it upon
                  authority. You were shown as a child, little by little, that it was best to do as
                  your parents ordered that you, but that showing was not the ground of your
                  obedience. That lay deeper still. You did not first convince your reason of the
                  evidences of parental care, before receiving it, but receiving that care because
                  ordained of God, you were strengthened to value it, by the proofs of love which it
                  made manifest to you."</p>
               <p>"I see, sir," said Maurice, after a pause.</p>
               <p>"It is then necessary to find that society."</p>
               <p>"Where is it?"</p>
               <p>"In the Church Catholic. You have taken one step—having found it not to be in the
                  Catholic Church, so-called, which is Papal and not Catholic."</p>
               <p>"Yet," said Bryan, "she has continuity!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but as you say, she puts out of her hand the Bible, the charter, which
                  should be, if she were true, her chiefest treasure. My dear young friend, here,
                  for the time being, is your part, study that out; read, when you can get them, the
                  writings of the Anglo-Catholic reformers. I will give you a note to the very man
                  in Oxford who can help you, and meanwhile try to live a sober, righteous, and
                  godly life. When the Church is found, you wall find the key to the Bible, and then
                  I hope and pray you will find that it tells you of a Saviour. Now I must say
                  good-night. It is past eleven, and I have much to do to-morrow. Only do not make
                  up your mind rashly, and when we both return to America, write me, and we shall
                  meet again. I will see you when you like here; but I can plainly discover that<pb
                     n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7264-00000034"/> your mind and soul will both need more
                  discipline ere the right hour come."</p>
               <p>Maurice left the room feeling much lightened in heart, but as Gardiner had
                  supposed, not convinced, and ready to relapse into his dreamy poco-curantism. He
                  little knew that ere he slept the good priest had prayed long and fervently for
                  him, nor how gladly, in spite of his seeming coolness, his heart had burned within
                  him as they talked. But Gardiner knew well the depths of the New-England pride of
                  reason; and though the way he had suggested may seem to some of the readers of
                  these sketches a way not according to the gospel pattern, he was nevertheless
                  right. The young man had great possessions of the intellect, and until he could
                  bring them to the market, resolved to sell all that he had, he would never follow
                  the Master whose steps lead to the cross. And the surest way to bring this about
                  was to suffer him to test their practical value for himself. "We speak what we do
                  know." The ordinary processes of "awakening" do not commonly turn the New-England
                  mind. It must shift its whole plane of spiritual and intellectual being ere it can
                  put on the white robe of true and loving discipleship.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>BRYAN left off his visits to the Propaganda. The conversation with Gardiner had
                  opened his eyes somewhat, and though he had but little opportunity for the reading
                  Gardiner had marked out for him, he contrived to work out one or two propositions
                  in his mind which were of use to him. The apparent sincerity of the Romanists had
                  at first attracted him, and, therefore, the first glimpse below the veil had
                  equally turned him back. One thing he saw; Gardiner was just as much, in his own
                  idea, the priest of the one Church as any foreign ecclesiastic, and was as
                  thoroughly in earnest, with the additional merit of being frank and honest. He was
                  dimly arriving at a sense of the claims of the Church, rather by way of feeling
                  than of argument, but, therefore, so much the more effectively. His contrast had
                  hitherto been entirely between the shifting, contending ways of popular
                  Protestantism, and the firm self-conviction of Rome. He liked neither, but wanted
                  something which both seemed to promise him in part. The thought of a position
                  which should combine the freedom from superstition of one with the reverence of
                  the other, pleased him. The difficulty was in knowing where to find it, and
                  New-Englander as he was, his first idea was, of course, to try and construct it
                  for himself. Gardiner might have helped him, but the Gardiners were just then
                  leaving Rome for the south of Italy, and busy with hurried sight-seeing. So he
                  drifted back into the American set. They were a good-natured, but awfully
                  reckless, somewhat dissipated, lot of young fellows, rich but ill-cultivated, full
                  of momentary enthusiasms, but very partial to champagne in the most absurd places,
                  and with very little of moral principle toward the other sex. They had two creeds
                  about woman,—one toward their own countrywomen, and another much worse toward<pb
                     n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7264-00000035"/> all foreigners. Maurice contrived to keep
                  only to the former, and hence was thrown very much with the young ladies of their
                  acquaintance—a lively, dressy set, who, while violating all the
                     <emph>covenances</emph> of continental propriety, were perfectly modest and
                  right-minded girls—according to their teaching. Miss Grant, the "Emily" of the
                  chapel-choir, soon contrived to draw him into a travelling flirtation. She had
                  tired of her lazy tenor admirer, who in his turn had tired of using his fine voice
                  in hymn tunes, and becoming aware that Maurice was a Harvard Unitarian, she seemed
                  inclined to change her missionary sphere from the conversion of a gay young New
                  Yorker, to the setting at rest the heresies of a quiet Bostonian. She knew about
                  as much of the one work as of the other, but she fancied herself, at first,
                  greatly successful, and, moreover, she was not half as much scandalized. Bryan was
                  ready enough to talk on religious matters with her; and, moreover, being all
                  afloat himself, he was scrupulous about unsettling the faith of another. He was
                  morbidly alive to the question of a religion. I think one gets so in Rome, from
                  the ceaseless presence of the sights and sounds of worship, and the under-current
                  of a great historic tradition continually drawing you in.</p>
               <p>There are pagan altars before which men once knelt in awful sincerity—these are
                  the tokens of the days of the martyrs. One may laugh at the head of St. Peter
                  impressed upon the wall of the Mamertine prison; but if you believe that Jugurtha
                  was really let down into its chill darkness, you cannot help feeling that St.
                  Peter <emph>might</emph> have trodden the same sad depths. So as Miss Grant had
                  not very great confidence in her theological powers, she was soon driven to the
                  Orthodox American formula of trying to coax her neophyte to go to church with her.
                  To her surprise Maurice assented. He even seemed glad to be asked—a new phase in
                  her experience of young men whose coats and boots were of the world, worldly.</p>
               <p>The American chapel at Rome was then a funny compound. One week it was
                  Presbyterian, the next New School Taylorite, the third Dutch Reformed. There was a
                  little bit of liturgy for such Low Church Episcopalians as were shocked at the
                  flowers of the English chapel in the Old Granary outside the walls; a peppery dash
                  at Calvinism ism for the conservative Orthodoxy of New York; a slant now and then
                  toward the laxer beliefs of Boston; and once, from the unexpected failure of a
                  preacher, a real bit of Quaker meeting, an half-hour's silence, at which next day
                  everybody laughed, excepting a Philadelphia family who were really of the faith of
                  Fox and Barclay. Strange men who had missions to convert the Pope, came and went;
                  young licentiates in theology aired their maiden sermons, and Doctors in Divinity
                  put forth their rounded periods. Maurice went steadily for three Sundays. He came
                  away from the last impressed with the feeling that it was a mere makeshift. He
                  said as much to the fair Emily that evening, in reply to her enthusiasm over the
                  morning sermon.</p>
               <p>"It was all very well, Miss Grant," said he; "but that sermon of his is flat
                  contradiction to the hymns you sang before and after it, and the prayers were to
                  both. We had Methodist singing, Baptist praying, and a sermon that was
                  neither."</p>
               <p>"But don't you like to see different denominations meeting on the common ground of
                  the Christian faith?"</p>
               <p>"No; not when they don't meet, and their ground isn't common. You and I say, that
                  'The voice of free grace cries escape to the mountain;' and then the Doctor prayed
                  that the elect might be speedily brought to a sense of the truth; and then Mr.
                  Adams told us that we had only to <emph>will</emph> to be converted, by
                  calculating the advantages of the step, and we should be converted. Somebody must
                  have been wrong."</p>
               <p>"But all believe in the Saviour," said she, "and that is the essential."</p>
               <p>"All disagree in that, it seems to me," said Maurice. "The fact is, I have
                  consulted both these gentlemen, as well as given an evening's study to the
                  hymn-book. Adams tells me that I must believe three and one to be the same thing.
                  I tried to work round it; but no, he tells me that is just Unitarianism in
                  disguise. The hymn-book says, Christ died for all, and the Doctor says, He did not
                  die for infants or the non-elect. The Doctor also says, I must be; immersed—he is
                  strong in that—by a regularly immersed minister; but he will not admit that any
                  Catholic can be a Christian, through the Baptistery at Florence would hold half
                  his congregation, and is deep enough to drown in.<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000036"/> Now, if I'm elected I can't see that immersion will
                  go for much, and if I'm not I am sure it won't."</p>
               <p>"You are beyond my depth," she replied, shaking her long curls; "but, I'm sure
                  that as Americans we ought to go to the Church where pure Christianity is
                  preached, and be true to the faith of our Fathers in a strange land."</p>
               <p>Maurice laughed, as he took his hat to go. "The 'faith of our Fathers' seems to me
                  a very uncertain faith; but if being born in Yankee-land makes one all right, I am
                  tolerably safe in that. However, in spite of the risk, next Sunday I am going
                  'outside the walls.'"</p>
               <p>He did so, and was shown into a back seat with liveried footmen and buttoned
                  pages. He could not follow the service in his American Prayer-Book, and was
                  utterly bewildered at a sermon upon the duty of Confession and Friday fasting. His
                  New-Englandism took fire; and the Sunday following he looked for a moment into a
                  church where Mass was going on, and then strolled out on the Campagna and
                  worshipped nature with the help of a pocket Shelley and a cigar.</p>
               <p>Worse followed. As he was lingering home through the dusk in a rather dissatisfied
                  mood, there dashed by him an open carriage filled with his young American friends.
                  They pulled up suddenly, a few yards beyond him, and looking back beckoned to him.
                  He came up and was greeted with a chorus of gay voices—</p>
               <p>"We've been to Frascati; had a jolly good time. Come and dine with us, and go to
                  the Opera to-night."</p>
               <p>"There's no Opera, you heathen, to-night."</p>
               <p>"Yes there is, and the best of the lot—always is, Sundays, you know."</p>
               <p>"No, there isn't."</p>
               <p>"Bet you what you like. Jump in, Maurice—squeeze in anyhow," and Bryan found
                  himself half hustled, in the big-schoolboy fashion of our young countrymen, into a
                  place—three on a seat, in a wide vanshackle vehicle; and so up the ancient Appian
                  pavement and over the smoother streets of modern Rome they rattled, to the door of
                  the Lepre.</p>
               <p>Maurice had never seen that famous dining-place of the artist brotherhood. He
                  found it a little repulsive: the smoky cavernous rooms, the odd waiters, the queer
                  dishes, the funny polyglot conversation, and free-and-easy ways, all jarred on his
                  fastidious taste. But his appetite was sharpened by his long ramble, and the
                  Orvieto good, and he, having been lonely all day, disposed to be companionable.
                  The boys were very polite to him; they had a notion that he was rather a superior
                  fellow, and deferred to his ideas on art and his authority on classic subjects. He
                  had been already a year in Europe, leisurely seeing and studying, while they had
                  only come out in the fall, and spent six weeks in Paris, as well as plenty of
                  money, and then posted as fast as possible to Rome for the winter. They were a
                  clannish, light-minded, superficial set, but brimful of good-nature, and very
                  ambitious to be gentlemanly.</p>
               <p>"By Jove, fellows, this is a new way of spending Sunday night," said one. "Three
                  months ago I was reading good little Sabbath-school books and the 'Christian
                  Visitor' at home, just as regularly as the week came round, unless I could get
                  leave to go to prayer-meeting. Do you know I had some thoughts of going to
                  Princeton—only the governor said he couldn't afford it."</p>
               <p>"Couldn't afford it! Mac, what in time do you mean? Princeton's cheap enough—cheap
                  and nasty, I think."</p>
               <p>"No, no;—you don't take. 'Look here, Fred,' said the paternal to me when I
                  proposed it—'you'll lose three years' studying. Then you'll come out of the
                  seminary and want to marry right off, and have to go hunting for a parish. You're
                  lucky if you get one up country with four hundred a year. You marry, and your wife
                  brings an olive-branch with every two years—parsons' wives always do. I shall have
                  to support you, at least, to the tune of a thousand a year; and then when you
                  break down with bronchitis, you and your tribe will be coming to live on me. The
                  great city churches are above your mark, and they don't go a-begging; besides,
                  they are no such great things after all. No, no; I can give you six months or a
                  year's run abroad; then you come home and settle down to business;
                     <emph>then</emph> I can do something for you, and by the time you'd have been
                  trying on your first white choker, you may be independent of me. Then marry
                     <emph>well</emph> and I shall be clear of you, and can look after the
                  rest.'"</p>
               <p>"Sensible man the Pater; what did the ma'am say?"</p>
               <p>"Oh she liked the Princeton dodge, and thinks I'd have<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000037"/> made a great preacher, but she has hopes of my next
                  brother Sam, or little Arty."</p>
               <p>"Well I'm bound to try the law," said another. "You can live at home then as long
                  as you're in an office, and if you don't get practice, go West. But, fellows, how
                  about Sunday? Oughtn't we to be keeping a little quieter to-day? I don't like
                  picking it out for a regular spreeing time; a fellow might stay at home and write
                  his letters, or go to chapel."</p>
               <p>"Oh, bother chapel. What's the good of chapel here? When a man settles at home
                  that's different; but for my part I always find myself thinking of all sorts of
                  things, at chapel, especially during the long prayers, either about the girls I
                  have been training round with, or else I fancy the ceiling a billiard-table, and
                  go to trying shots all over it. Last Sunday I was so sure of one that the moment
                  church was out I went and had a try at it on Pietro's table in the Corso. So I
                  concluded my chapel-going didn't amount to much."</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you what <emph>I</emph> used to think of during sermon-time in the old
                  meeting-house at home," broke in another. "Very much like that, only more so. I
                  used to fancy getting all the glass chimneys of the lamps and setting them up at
                  the end of the aisle and bowling at them with the shades. They were round as balls
                  you know, just globes of cut-glass. If I could have got in on the sly the day
                  before I left home, I would have done it, sure."</p>
               <p>Maurice laughed at the odd idea. The speaker, however, went on. "That is what
                  church-going comes to with most of us young fellows. We have nothing to do, and it
                  don't interest us, and we can't help thinking. I don't see the use. Two of my best
                  friends experienced religion in the great revival, and for six weeks they never
                  let me alone about joining with them. In six months one of them was on his way to
                  Calcutta before the mast, for having got his fingers too far into his boss's safe;
                  and the other married a girl in a hurry, and if he don't drink now, it is because
                  he can't find a bar to run his face at in ten miles round. It was a pity, too, for
                  better and steadier fellows than they were before I never saw; but just being so
                  set up with the idea of being all right, seemed to make them lose all head."</p>
               <p>"But," said Maurice, "that was not the case with <emph>all</emph> who were
                  converted then?"</p>
               <p>"No, it did some of them a devilish deal of good. Some of the hardest cases stuck
                  to it, and are all right now. Ned Holmes and Sam Goodwin, my friends, you see
                  never had been in anything wrong before, but this it was did for them. They had
                  got through-tickets to glory, and so," added he with a laugh, "they stopped at the
                  first station to take a drink and the cars left them."</p>
               <p>"But," said Maurice, "was not the trouble that they had the wrong motive,—this
                  'going to glory,' as you call it?"</p>
               <p>"I don't see what other, except to keep out of scrapes. If a man cannot keep from
                  lying and stealing and getting beastly drunk unless he joined the Church, he had
                  better join; but if he can, what's the use, of being tied up so that you can't
                  play a quiet game of whist, or smoke a cigar, or be in the same room with a glass
                  of wine, or dance, or go to the theatre? Because you can't swim it's hard that I
                  mustn't go in bathing. There's the humbug of it. If you're a Church-member, all
                  these things are sinful; if you're not, nobody thinks the worse of you, if you
                  only behave."</p>
               <p>"Look here, Harry, you're all wrong," said one who had not spoken before,—a
                  dark-faced, black-haired young man, with a slight sneer always playing round his
                  mouth, and a sensual fullness of the lower jaw. "<emph>I</emph> hope to be a
                  religious man. If I'm not, I know what will become of me." And he pointed with his
                  forefinger emphatically downwards to the floor. "I shall be one if I am to be,
                  when my time comes. I sha'n't be before that for all my trying. Until I am I can't
                  make things worse nor better, and so I have my good time while I can."</p>
               <p>"But Mr. Jones," said Maurice, "you don't mean to say that you may break all the
                  commandments as often as you like, and then repent and be clear of the whole
                  afterwards?"</p>
               <p>"Yes I do; keeping them will make no difference if I'm not effectually called, and
                  if I am then what has happened before will make no difference. If God means to
                  save me out of hell He can do it without me, and if He don't I can't make Him.
                  Meanwhile I have an engagement with a friend who don't like to be kept waiting,"
                  and with a satyr-like leer he rose to go, his handsome face looking positively<pb
                     n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7264-00000038"/> ugly for a moment. He bent down and
                  whispered something in the ear of his neighbor, and was gone. The debate had been
                  free enough till he spoke,—earnest, but rather laughingly carried on,—but this
                  last had fallen like a wet blanket on them all. There was a moment's silence, and
                  then one said in a low tone, "Left you again to set"——</p>
               <p>"Hush!" said the other; "never mind."</p>
               <p>"But I do mind, and I'll go halves with you, for it is a downright swindle. I move
                  we cut Jones. He's the worst man I know in Rome, and if he is going to be mean
                  with the bills, then, hang him, let him slide."</p>
               <p>"So I say. Anyhow, that's queer doctrine of his, that we are all bound for
                  brimstone and no help for it. If Jones is to be 'called,' as he calls it, I'm not
                  so sure that I had n't rather stay out in the cold. Fancy having to live forever
                  with such a fellow! Not much heaven in that."</p>
               <p>"See here, fellows, don't let's have that sort of talk. I don't believe him, you
                  know; but there is something in what he says, only he has it all put wrong end,
                  foremost. We had all best keep decent now, and when the time does come for any of
                  us, we sha'n't have so much lee-way to fetch up. I can't answer his way of putting
                  it; but I know this,—I may slip off the jib-boom end of a dark night at sea, and I
                  don't want to have a rascally life to reckon up just when I'm trying to keep
                  afloat. I know some things won't hurt any of us to do, but this Sunday spreeing is
                  not one of them, and <emph>I</emph> don't go again. Come, boys, let's be off."</p>
               <p>They rose from the table. Maurice slipped his arm into that of the last speaker.
                  "Come up to my room and have a quiet talk."</p>
               <p>The rest went off for the Opera, considering that as they had made a day of it, it
                  was just as well to finish it but resolving all to do better a week hence.</p>
               <p>I dare say some of my readers will be scandalized by this free talk. I cannot help
                  it. The scandal is in the thing itself, not in the describing it. It will do some
                  of us no hurt to know what young men really think and feel, and how they express
                  themselves when with one another. I should like to write a proper tale about
                  proper characters. But when a man starts to find religious knowledge, by the cross
                  country route, he will meet with many who are not proper characters, as in fact,
                  generally, if he keep his eyes open and live in the world like a man.</p>
               <p>I am describing young men as they are,—at least as a great many of them are, and
                  if the description is not an attractive one it concerns somebody to try and make
                  things better. Much as I detest Rome's way of dealing with her laity, one thing we
                  might learn from her, that if is worth while to know the facts in respect of those
                  we are trying to convert into Christian men and women. The confessional is not
                  needed for that, but common sense and moral fearlessness are. As long as young men
                  laugh at us for good, solemn, but utterly unsophisticated bookworms, we shall not
                  influence them much. The patient must fee that the physician understands his case
                  before he will be submissive to the treatment.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>WHEN they reached Maurice's chamber the conversation was at first upon indifferent
                  topics. Then a brief pause ensued, and Bryan said, looking up suddenly, "Mr.
                  Stewart, you are not a member of any church, yet you seem to have religious ideas.
                  I want to know what you think? I am afraid of all these people who are committed;
                  they are working for their own sects, and just repeat what they have been taught
                  in childhood. I can read their catechisms, and all that, when I want to, without
                  taking things at second hand. But you,—you <emph>think,</emph> and I want to know
                  what you make of that fellow Jones' talk. I confess I cannot answer it, and never
                  could, only I don't believe it any the more. You may put it any way you please;
                  but how is one to reconcile one's free-will with the infinite power and knowledge
                  of the Creator? If the doctrine of the atonement is true, why doesn't the other
                  thing follow? There's my rub, you see."</p>
               <p>"Well, now, Mr. Maurice," said Stewart, setting his elbows on the table, and
                  pushing back, with both hands, the thick black curls from his forehead, "I'll tell
                  you what I think of the whole thing. I've been to sea since I was eleven years
                  old, and a man must think a good deal when he is keeping the middle watch of a
                  quiet night in the trades. Now, if you won't be shocked at my way of putting
                  things,—a sailor's rough way,—I will tell you what I think of it. I have pretty
                  much worked out the thing in my own way, with the help of my Bible. God sends the
                  winds to blow as he will, but He doesn't hinder us from sailing on whatever voyage
                  we set out. He sends the storms, too; and when a man is caught jammed in between
                  the Isle o' Man, and the Welsh coast under his lee, in a North-Channel hurricane,
                  no arm but His can save him. For all that, it don't do for one to go out of port
                  with a short-handed crew, and sprung spars, and rotten rigging, and a leak under
                  your forefoot. Now, He has given His orders, and the first thing a man learns at
                  sea is, 'Obey orders if you break owners.'"</p>
               <p>"That I see plainly enough," said Maurice, "but how about the atonement?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't mean to speak about that irreverently, or make comparisons which
                  shouldn't be made; but it seems to me as if our part in it was something like
                  this: Suppose the crew of a man-of-war mutiny and go below just as the ship comes
                  under fire. The captain, after calling on all hands to do their duty, goes to the
                  wheel himself, and with his own hands steers the ship by the batteries, but he
                  himself is hit and mortally wounded. Now, if government was to say to that crew,
                  'You, every one of you, deserve to be hung at the yard-arm, but your captain has
                  begged that you be let off for his sake. You shall be forgiven if you will try to
                  be true and brave men,—true to the death.' It does seem to me, that if anything
                  would make good and true men out of a set of mutinous rascals, it would be such a
                  piece of good news given to them as they stood with the ropes round their necks.
                  And just suppose the captain in some way come to life again, and ready to lead
                  them once more," if they would only follow him."</p>
               <p>"You think, then,"—said Maurice, who had followed but this sailor rhetoric as best
                  he might, rather hazily,—"you think that the moral effect and example of the
                  Lord's death is the principle of the atonement?"</p>
               <p>"Moral example?—No! I tell you that the men who have skulked their duty and
                  deserve to be strung up and know it, are pardoned; pardoned for the sake of one
                  who has done his duty, and who is rightful master of them all, and has a perfect
                  right to say they ought to be served so. It isn't a merit of their own if they do
                  their duty after that; it is the least they can do; and if they don't, they
                  deserve to be hanged, and that with a new Manilla rope, and a whole starboard
                  watch to sway aloft on it. Still," he continued, "there is a bit of a puzzle here
                  that I was a long time in making out. And what came to help me was after I got
                  into the Navy and heard the Articles of War read. They read, you know, after each
                  offence, 'You shall suffer<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7264-00000040"/> death, or such
                  other punishment as a court-martial shall inflict When I first heard that, as a
                  middy, it struck me as fearfully hard. But after a couple of cruises I knew
                  better. I found out then what disobedience of orders might bring. When you send a
                  crew to quarters in port, or are exercising them at making sail, and all that, and
                  the order is given, 'Let go the foretop-bowline,' for instance, and the man isn't
                  at his station, it may be only a rope parted, or the work put wrong. But when
                  you're ranging alongside an enemy's frigate, and because one man skulks his duty,
                  and, for want of doing the right thing just at the right moment, your ship misses
                  stays and is raked, fifty stout fellows' souls may be logged against that one
                  skulker's account. Man-o'-war life is an easy life when every one does his duty,
                  but you see a powder-monkey's carelessness may blow up a line-o'-battle ship; and
                  so you see a man's duty isn't measured by just the way it looks to him. But, on
                  the other hand, if a man does his best, any reasonable set of officers know how to
                  make allowances for mistakes, and they like and favor a man who pulls with a will,
                  and tries to be true to the country and the flag. I said to myself many a time,
                  the Articles, bloody as they seem, are only meant for those who deserve all they
                  get. The service isn't, a machine, where, if you put your hand in the wrong place,
                  your arm is torn off at the shoulder, whether it is accident or mistake or
                  foolhardiness, all alike. It is meant for reasonable beings, and a man's motives
                  and good-will are taken account of."</p>
               <p>"I can't say I quite get your idea," said Maurice. "What about being justified by
                  faith? The clergyman I saw lately talked a great deal about the necessity of that,
                  and said that all one's works were nothing at all, and worse than nothing."</p>
               <p>"Well, just you read what St. Paul says. He is a man that all sailors love, if for
                  nothing else than for that voyage of his. I've been in a Levanter, off Cape
                  Spartivento, and I know that any one who could keep a cool head and a brave heart
                  there, and, what is better, give them to all the rest, especially with a lot of
                  soldiers aboard—to my thinking the worst sort of passengers, because, you see,
                  they are accustomed to take nobody's orders but their own officers'—was not a man
                  to be set down for a know-nothing. St. Paul gave me a deal of comfort; for it
                  seemed to me that his idea of faith was just the sailor's idea of trust in his
                  captain—keep to your duty, and let it blow high or blow low. And his notion of a
                  man's duty seems to me our sailor's notion—that a man must have his wits about
                  him, not waiting for orders for every little thing, like one of those sentries who
                  can't answer a civil question, or do anything but just be drilled. You see, on
                  shipboard, we get our general orders; but a man must know how to do his work, and
                  learn it, and have an eye to windward. When I'm sent to the wheel, the officer of
                  the deck gives me my course by compass, but he isn't at my elbow all the time,
                  telling me just when to put the helm up and put it down. I know I've got to keep
                  the sails full, and meet her when she comes up, and not let her fall off It's
                  intelligent service that is expected of me. A prime seaman who is always ready to
                  obey all orders, without a question, uses his head, for all that, quite as much as
                  any landsman can do."</p>
               <p>"I see," said Maurice, "what you mean, and I like it, too. Your idea of the
                  pardoned mutineer is not a bad one. To such a man pardon is good news; and that,
                  by the way, is what Gospel-evangel really means, though I never thought it. But
                  there is another point I want cleared up. I suppose, on your own showing, you
                  would have to accept the pardon by taking service again. If a Christian means a
                  pardoned mutineer, he has to speak out and promise to be loyal and obedient,
                  before he can show it by his conduct."</p>
               <p>"That is so, sure enough, and I mean to do it the first chance I get."</p>
               <p>"Well, here is <emph>my</emph> trouble," said the other, "I don't know how and
                  where I ought to do it."</p>
               <p>"As for that, I can only give you my sailor notions," said Stewart. "I say,
                  whenever I see the old flag flying, and that is the Cross, I go aboard and report
                  myself to the commanding-officer. I have my choice, and if I can find an Episcopal
                  chaplain, I shall go to him. You see that suits us, sailors; it is more
                  ship-shape. We like to have our officers under rules, as well as we are, and not
                  left to their own heads. I don't mean to hurt your feelings; but this chapel here,
                  at Rome, is a sort of fore-and-aft concern, like a mackerel-schooner bound for the
                  Banks, the skipper, mayhap cook last voyage, and foremast-hand the next. If<pb
                     n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7264-00000041"/> those rich churches on shore only knew
                  how ranch good they could do the sailors, they would take more pains about it. A
                  Prayer-Book is a thing any captain may carry, and read the service. It suits
                  old-country emigrants; and many's the time, in the Liverpool trade, when they're
                  sick and down-hearted, that a bit of it will put life into them. One can carry the
                  short prayers out of it in his head; and on a wild night aloft it's a comfort to
                  have them to say over, when you have too much to do to be making up prayers, and
                  thinking what you ought to be saying. We've a name for everything, and a place for
                  everything aboard-ship. I wish I had a Prayer-Book now."</p>
               <p>Maurice remembered that he had two—Frank's, and the one Mr. Gardiner had given
                  him. He hesitated a minute, and then said, "I can spare you one, the gift of a
                  friend, however; and I must ask you, when you get where you can buy another, to
                  return it to me."</p>
               <p>Stewart took the little book, thanking Maurice, and rose to go. "Good-bye," said
                  he. "My leave will be up next week, and I must be back in Liverpool. I've a fourth
                  mate's berth in one of the American steamers, and I hope we'll make the trip
                  together. Good-night,"—and he was gone.</p>
               <p>This conversation was not without its effect. Of course the young sailor's idea of
                  the Atonement, and of faith, is not presented as a scientific statement of the
                  truth. No one but himself is to be held answerable for it; and if it is not
                  orthodox, no cavil must be taken at it. This is a story, not a treatise on
                  doctrine. Its object is to show the history of a mind's progress, and all things
                  true or false which help therein are part of it.</p>
               <p>Consequently it will not be improper to turn to a very different scene. One of
                  Rome's annual events is Prince Torlonia's ball. The grandson of the lucky
                  shoemaker, who made a fortune out of an army contract with the first Napoleon, now
                  props the Papal finance and its tottering sovereignty. Everybody who banks with
                  him is invited; all notabilities, foreign ambassadors, and the like, are there. He
                  keeps a palace expressly for his fetes, and mingles the splendid with the shabby
                  in magnificent parsimony. Maurice, of course, was there. It was a scene of
                  fairy-like enchantment. Soft lights, from hundreds of wax-candles, illuminated a
                  brilliant suite of apartments. There was the reception-room, the music-room, the
                  ball-room, the conversation-room, the card-room, where sat Antonelli, playing with
                  Gen. ——, the French commander at Rome. The wives of the Roman <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">noblesse,</foreign> Orsini, Pamphili-Doria, Corsini, and a host
                  of others, were there, blazing with necklaces of diamonds, family heirlooms, taken
                  out of pawn for that one night. A Bavarian countess, with a magnificent diamond
                  tiara, rivalled in her splendid beauty the fair Principessa Torlonia, the daughter
                  of the Colonna. A Shrewsbury and a Dufferin bore up worthily the escutcheon of
                  England's proud, matronly loveliness; and the New World was represented by scores
                  of delicate, superbly-toiletted beauties, in the evanescent spring-time of
                  American belle-hood. There were serene Bostonians, secure in their Emersonian
                  creed; that philosophy, and the rare accident of birth in the three-hilled city,
                  had made them "lords" (or, rather, "ladies")— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                        <l>The seven stars, and the solar year."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> Besides these were the coldly-passionate girls of the South, full of <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">retenue,</foreign> yet ready to break forth into fire at a
                  whisper against the haughty pretensions of their States; frank Philadelphians,
                  showy New Yorkers, and not a damsel of them all but remembered and reverenced in
                  her secret soul the tradition of the few peerless Americans, who, like the lady of
                  Burleigh, had won, and, far more successfully than her, had worn, the perilous
                  honors of transatlantic nobility.</p>
               <p>Verily, the American female-worship of the heraldic honors of the mediaeval time
                  is fearfully and wonderfully ordered. It is the child's reverence for age. Before
                  it the best scheming of cunning mammas of that fearless, indefatigable British
                  matronage goes down in dismay; but it buys dust and ashes at the price of life.
                  Its type is the Balaclava Charge, of which France said, "<foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >C'est magnifique, mais c'est ne pas la guerre.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>Amid this throng Bryan met almost all his winter acquaintance. Even the younger
                  members of the Quaker family were there; the sons rather "loud" in dress and free
                  in manner, and the daughter, while attired after the fashion of the "world's
                  people," preserving that indefinable air of<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7264-00000042"
                  /> neatness and delicacy which is nowhere so sedulously taught and learned as in
                  high-toned Quaker families. Without an ornament, and hardly with a bit of decided
                  color in all her dress, the young Philadelphian attracted many eyes, and her frank
                  enjoyment of what, to her, was a novel and exciting spectacle, was very pleasant
                  to see. Maurice obtained an introduction, and as she did not dance, which, in the
                  crush of the ball-room, was a toil of a pleasure, she accepted his arm and went
                  with him to the other end of the grand suite of stately rooms, where was a little
                  theatre, upon the mimic stage of which a company of no mean artists were
                  performing a brilliant little comic opera. Like many Quakeresses, she was
                  passionately fond of music, and was entirely enthralled in the witchery of that
                  most magical of entertainments. Her guarded home-experience gave her no inkling
                  off what it was that she was at,—what to her would be a forbidden amusement,—nor
                  had she become wiser abroad. Consequently she enjoyed with all her soul, and,
                  after the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">finale,</foreign> chatted with a child's
                  enthusiasm, and listened to Maurice's account of the story, evidently without a
                  scruple, while she visibly shrank from the card-room, and glanced with a look of
                  lively horror at the impassive Cardinal, who sat with a little heap of gold before
                  him, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vis--vis</foreign> to the fat, gray French general.
                  When Maurice pointed out to her the celebrities present, he was surprised at her
                  familiarity with literature and history. A son of Mrs. Hemans was talking with an
                  American poet, whose delicate verse and comic mastery of the humorous dialect of
                  New England are alike unrivalled. The twin stars of Arno—Paracelsus and Aurora
                  Leigh—were there, a German historian and diplomat, and many another whose names
                  were household words to her. After the airy ignorance of the New York belles, and
                  the cool, critical <foreign xml:lang="LAT">nil admirari</foreign> of Boston, this
                  was very refreshing. Yet there was no attempt to play off upon him airs and
                  graces. She talked to him as simply and unconsciously as to a brother, without a
                  shadow of boldness, and yet without diffidence. We are to meet her again, and
                  therefore I tell the story of the commencement of their acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Out of a ball-room it is a brief step into the scenes of Carnival week. It is a
                  mad time in Rome, especially the last two days. Maurice was not too old for the
                  fun, which is rather school-boy like, but for all that exciting, and, so far as
                  the Italians are concerned, perfectly good-natured. He rode up and down the long
                  line of carriages which slowly traversed the Corso. He flung bouquets to the
                  ladies in the balconies, and <foreign xml:lang="ITA">confetti</foreign> at the men
                  on the sidewalk. Then he took a balcony at a friend's lodging, and showered
                  handfuls of the snowy hail, which is supposed by a conventional fiction to be
                  sugar-plums, but which is only plaster and flour, into' the open vehicles beneath.
                  He saw the riderless horses, the fiery, fine-limbed Barbary colts race day after
                  day. He had by this time "done" the galleries, the antiquities, and all the lions
                  thoroughly, and it was somewhat of a relief to get into such a practical present,
                  after so much of the past, even though of such mad nonsense as the Carnival. He
                  went home every night tired enough, yet not so tired but that he could spend an
                  hour over a book. He was lodged at a house upon the slope of the Pincian Hill, and
                  his room was at the top of the many-storied dwelling, looking out over the city.
                  There at night he would sit reading, and step from the soft lamplight within out
                  on to his balcony and muse long upon what he read. His book was one which Gardiner
                  had lent him,—a brief history of the English Church. It was not at all polemical,
                  quite elementary in fact, and would have been hastily glanced over at another
                  time. Here its simple statements, read over and over, chapter by chapter, wrought
                  with no little effect upon his mind. They opened new avenues for thought. He faced
                  that disclosure, to a New-Englander so startling, of the organic continuity of the
                  Anglo-Catholic Church, through the stormy period of the Reformation, and that
                  still more startling point of its primitive independence of Rome and derivation
                  from a Gallo-Oriental source. He had hitherto regarded the Church of England as
                  one created upon the ruin of the old faith, very much as if the Christians in
                  Jerusalem had managed to outvote the Sanhedrim and take possession of the Temple.
                  A restoration of what was primitive was an idea undreamt of hitherto in his
                  philosophy. He conceded the point as respected England. Still the English Church
                  was English, and by no means Catholic, and his present dream was the idea of
                  Catholic unity. He had yet to grasp the idea of Episcopalians being other than a
                  sect in America. That rooted idea of Congregational<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000043"/> gational New England,—the right of the majority to
                  organize belief and practice for themselves,—hindered him. The English Church was
                  the Establishment; but we had no establishment, and therefore—here his logic went
                  woolgathering, and that conclusion was not yet. Thus matters stood when he went
                  out on the evening of Shrove Tuesday, the night of the Mocoletti, the last night
                  of the Carnival.</p>
               <p>The night of the Mocoletti is the one night of Roman gaiety. The whole length of
                  the Corso, seen from above, is like a vast serpent formed of fire-flies. A
                  torch-light procession, or an illumination (and either of these, well managed, are
                  sights of great beauty), is more imposing, but less magical, bewildering,
                  grotesque. From every balcony, window-ledge, and possible resting-place of man,
                  glitters a myriad of little tapers. Everybody is carrying a light, and everybody
                  is trying to blow out his neighbor's, while all throats send up a mocking, pealing
                  chorus of "Senza mocolo, mocolo m-o—co—l-o-o-o-o,"—in English, "without a light,"
                  and intended as a taunt to those whose lights are extinguished. Young and active
                  as he was, Maurice soon left the balcony of his friends and went down into the
                  street, joining the throng on foot and mingling in the maddest of the sport. Now
                  standing with one foot on the step of a carriage, he aimed a rapid blow at the
                  twinkling spark of a solitary taper; then, darting into the crowd, he slapped
                  right and left with a knotted handkerchief at two flaming candles borne by two
                  English middies; next, with an active vault, he was on the back of a horse and
                  snatched from the postillion a light, rekindled his own taper, blew out the stolen
                  prize, and sprang to earth again amid the cheers of the beholders. He had reached
                  in triumph the broad piazza in the midst of which towers the ancient column of
                  Antoine, when a little eddying whirl of the crowd threw him outside the line of
                  pedestrians. He paused to take breath and to look bout him. All at once he caught
                  sight of a female figure standing near the base of the pillar. There was that in
                  her attitude so markedly unlike every other about him that he looked again. It was
                  that of patient, drooping endurance, like that of the little girl in Ary
                  Scheffer's charming picture of the "Lost Children." Yet she was not a child, and
                  his next thought was of the lady in the Masque of Comus. The quiet neatness and
                  precision I of her dress had a familiar look, and as he was trying to think where
                  he had seen it, a surge of the crowd forced him close to her side. As he raised
                  his little taper with the instinctive movement of <emph>light</emph> preservation,
                  which is part of one's habit on the night of the Mocoletti, the gleam fell upon
                  her face and showed the features of the young Quakeress of Torlonia's ball.</p>
               <p>"You here, alone, Miss Winrow! Can I help you?" exclaimed he.</p>
               <p>She gave a little half-sob, half-cry, and clasped his arm with both her hands. "I
                  have lost my party," she said, "and could not get through the crowd. My brother is
                  so wild; and thee knows," said she, lapsing unconsciously into the familiar speech
                  of her childhood, "young men do not care much for their sisters."</p>
               <p>"Permit me to take the place of this lost brother," said Maurice. "You are
                  stopping at ——?"</p>
               <p>"The Hotel del Europa on the ——. I have forgotten the street."</p>
               <p>"I know it well," said Maurice, "but are you equal to the long walk we must take,
                  unless we can break through the line of carriages? We must, I fear, go round the
                  head of the Corso."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes," said she. "I don't mind the walk; but Thomas—he may miss me and return
                  here."</p>
               <p>"I think I ought to get you home first, and then try to hunt him up."</p>
               <p>"Thank thee; perhaps it would be best so," she answered; "but thee, you I mean,
                  will lose the spectacle."</p>
               <p>"Oh never mind that," said Maurice, flinging away his taper and leading her at
                  once out of the crowd.</p>
               <p>He had at once a sense of grave responsibility. It is not so easy to traverse Rome
                  by night. One may easily lose his way, and some quarters are neither reputable nor
                  safe after nightfall. Maurice was familiar with the streets of the city, but in
                  his anxiety to spare his companion unnecessary walking he several times missed his
                  road, and once had to leave her outside at the door of a wine-shop while he
                  inquired within the route. Not until he reached the broader and more frequented
                  Via Babuino did he breathe freely. When at length he emerged into that well-known
                  thoroughfare, he gave a long sigh of relief.</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7264-00000044"/>
               <p>Miss Winrow had kept silent pace with him, walking with the short, tripping step
                  which betrayed her schooling over the brick smoothness of Arch and Chestnut
                  Streets. She had kept silent as long as she had seen him perplexed with the
                  intricacies of the way, but now spoke. "Is thee—are you tired?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no," said he, "only wonderfully relieved to know just where I am and to have
                  you in comparative safety."</p>
               <p>"Were we not safe?" said she. "I have not felt afraid."</p>
               <p>"Well, to tell the truth, I have been more anxious than I care to be again, for
                  the last ten minutes, ever since we passed that cut-throat looking group of men
                  under the little shrine on the corner where the light was burning before the
                  Virgin."</p>
               <p>She turned her face, with a look of quiet, grateful sweetness upon it, toward him
                  and said, "Then I have to thank thee for more than I know."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that is nothing," said he, "only I am glad we are well out of it. But were
                  not you frightened before I met you all alone in the crowd?"</p>
               <p>"No, not frightened; I was thinking of something I once did which seems to me
                  might be very wrong; and yet, I don't know why, I felt, if I never got out of the
                  danger alive, it would be a real comfort."</p>
               <p>"What can it be?" thought Bryan.</p>
               <p>She seemed to make a sudden effort over herself, and then said, "I must tell you
                  what it was or you will think it so grange; besides, I have long wanted to tell
                  some one not of my own family." Maurice could think of nothing but a love-affair,
                  and was inwardly disgusted at being taken for one so old and grave that he might
                  safely be father-confessor of such confidences. He simply said, "Your secret will
                  be safe with me, Miss Winrow, and such advice as I have to give is at your
                  service."</p>
               <p>"Well, if you do not mind a long story I will tell it, for I really want to know
                  if I have done wrong. Only I must begin at the beginning. I have a school-friend
                  who came from New York. Her father was a Friend—a Quaker, thee knows, but her
                  mother was not; she was an Episcopalian, and Letty was brought up to that, and
                  when her mother died, she made Letty promise to be true to her Church till she was
                  a woman. We were great friends at school, and when we left she was always writing
                  to have me visit her. So just before were were coming away here I went to spend a
                  month with her. She was not a gay girl at all ever, but now I found her more good
                  and quiet, and so fond of her Church. Of course I did not think as she did, and at
                  first did not care to talk with her about it, only I could not help hearing what
                  was said between her friends who called on her. First-days—Sundays—I used to go to
                  Friends' meeting with Letty's father, as I promised at home I would, but week-days
                  she got me to go with her. At first it was so strange, but I liked it better and
                  better. There was a church near where they had daily prayers at nine and five, and
                  Letty never missed going, if she was well. I liked to see the little children
                  baptized, as almost always on Wednesday and Saturday one or two were brought, and
                  at home I used to read over the service in the Prayer-Book, and then I found there
                  was another service for grown-up people, so I read that too; and then I took the
                  Bible and found the places which the book alluded to, and it made me feel as if
                  Friends' Society had been mistaken in this thing. One First-day evening we were
                  sitting in the parlor, and a friend of Letty's came in. He was a young minister,
                  and Letty was engaged to him, but they would not let me leave them, though I tried
                  to. Letty was just so nice and thoughtful of others, and he seemed just as good as
                  she. He soon found out what I was, and then I asked him some things about the
                  service which I could not understand; and so I can't tell how it came on, but I
                  said, 'I wish I had been brought as a little child.' 'It is not too late now, is
                  it?' he said; but Letty turned the subject before I could answer. But after we got
                  up to our room at night, she spoke of it herself. I had been thinking about it all
                  the time in meeting, and I did long for it more than any one could tell. So as we
                  sat there, and I was at the glass putting up my hair, I told Letty I meant to go
                  forward the next time there was a baptism. We talked a long time about it, but
                  neither of us thought of father and mother, what they would think, and that is
                  what seems to me now so wrong, though they are not strict at all. The next day
                  Letty was not well, and I went to service alone. There were but few people in the
                  church, which seems to me so strange, for I would go whenever I possibly could. I
                     sat<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7264-00000045"/> up in front, for in Friends'
                  meeting we young people often do, on the low benches; so after service was over I
                  stopped to look at the I font. It was a very beautiful one, of white marble, and
                  carved on all the panels. While I stood there, Letty's young clergyman came back
                  into the church. He had read service that morning. It seemed to me I must speak
                  then, I was to go home so very soon, and I said, 'I wish I might come here.' 'Why
                  should not you come?' said he. Then I told him I had never thought of it till
                  lately, but I wished it so much and believed it to be right. He asked me some
                  questions as to what I believed and as to what I thought baptism meant, and then
                  he begged me to wait a minute. He went away, and presently the other clergyman of
                  the church came back with him. He was an elderly man, his hair quite white, and
                  such a pleasant, good face, the purest, gentlest looking face I ever saw. Well, my
                  daughter,' he said, 'you want to be baptized. From what Mr. —— tells me I think I
                  ought to receive you; but is there any reason why you should not come?' 'No," I
                  said, 'there is none.' 'Are you free to decide this for yourself? Is there no one
                  you should first consult?' I really did not think father and mother would care,
                  for when my Cousin Robert became a Presbyterian they blamed Uncle Robert and Aunt
                  Catherine quite a good deal for being so put out about it; and I remember they
                  said if Robert only followed the inward light, he ought not to be blamed. So I
                  said 'No.' If I could have written and got an answer, I should have waited; but I
                  knew I could not, for as soon as I returned home we expected to start for Europe.
                  I thought of the great ocean which I dreaded so much, and so I said, 'I would like
                  to come this afternoon, and Letty will come to stand up with me.' 'What! Miss ——?
                  My own godchild? Oh, if <emph>she</emph> is your witness,' said the old clergyman,
                  'it can't be wrong. She never did anything wrong since she was a wee baby.' Well,
                  after I went home and talked with Letty, she insisted upon being well enough to go
                  with me, though she had a sick-headache almost, and she took me to Doctor ——'s
                  study, and he had a long talk with us, and Letty made a great many things plain to
                  me, for she understood Friends' ways, and helped me to tell the Doctor what I
                  meant, only I could not express it rightly. So we came to the church at five that
                  afternoon; not many there, but all seemed like people who really loved to come,
                  and the church not very light, but quiet and gentle for all the bustle of the
                  streets outside. It seemed to me as though I had really left the world behind me.
                  When the time for baptizing came my heart beat quick, and I would have kept still;
                  but Letty gave me a quiet pressure of the hand, and untied and took off my bonnet,
                  and led the way. The young clergyman came and stood on the other side in that
                  white dress thee knows they wear; and such a dear, good lady, with a sad, sad
                  face, like one that had known trouble, but found real comfort too, came and stood
                  next Letty. It made me feel stronger at once, and when the questions were put to
                  me, I did not look on my book at all, but tried to speak them right out of my own
                  heart, for I meant them just as truly as I ever hope to mean anything. It seems
                  strange now, but when the water touched me, it was like washing off all light and
                  vain feelings, and I did promise in my heart to try to be kind and true to every
                  one; and when he made the sign of the cross on my forehead, at seemed like taking
                  up the Saviour's cross. Then afterward it was so very dear to have everybody kneel
                  down and join in the Lord's Prayer; it was as if we were all one family."</p>
               <p>"But, Miss Winrow," said Maurice, who had listened with great astonishment first,
                  and then with eager interest, "you surely don't think this was wrong. I would give
                  my right hand this moment to feel as you did."</p>
               <p>"No, not that so much, but afterward, not telling mother. To-night, just before
                  you came to me, I was so distressed thinking of that. Ought not I to tell her
                  now?"</p>
               <p>Among the books Maurice had read in the Propaganda Library, was one put into his
                  hands with special reference to the question of secret conversion to Romanism. It
                  had strongly attracted him, for it set forth the advantage of being in the service
                  of the Church and leading others to it without being an avowed member. All young
                  men's minds are fascinated with the notion of a secret society in which to exert
                  great and unsuspected power. This was most artfully put. He was well aware of the
                  unpopularity which the becoming a Romanist would bring upon him at home. The point
                  was cunningly argued; the lawfulness of dissimulating because of the unreasonable
                  prejudices of others. All its sophisms rose at once before him. For himself he
                     had<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7264-00000046"/> been half persuaded, but when it
                  came to applying that reasoning to the ease of another, of a pure, innocent young
                  girl, then looking trustfully at him for an, answer, the he shocked him, and thus
                  the last lingering spell of Rome vanished into thin air at the Ithuriel spear.</p>
               <p>"You ought to tell," said he. "Mind, I do not blame you for not having told; only
                  I say tell now."</p>
               <p>Her only answer was at first a low sob. Then she gathered strength to speak. "Thou
                  hast been a true friend. God sent thee just when I needed."</p>
               <p>Maurice was too much moved to reply. They were by this time at the Hotel del
                  Europa. Two gentlemen stood in the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">porte cochre,</foreign>
                  trying to induce a coachman to let them take his vehicle, and evidently under
                  strong but subdued excitement.</p>
               <p>"Father—Thomas—here I am!" exclaimed she. And in a moment was in he arms of the
                  elder, with whom the decorum of Quaker reserve utterly broke down for a momnt.
                  Maurice was going, but the younger detained him. And then, after a word or two
                  from his daughter, the old gentleman addressed him—</p>
               <p>"We cannot thank thee enough for bringing Ellen back safe. What is thy name?"</p>
               <p>A few words of explanation and introduction followed, and Maurice was eagerly
                  besought to call on the morrow.</p>
               <p>"My wife," said the old gentleman, "will then be able to see thee; her fright
                  to-night has been too much for her, but Bryan thee has done us a service we can
                  never forget."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>BRYAN was punctual in his next morning's call upon his Philadelphian friends. He
                  found the ladies in, was presented to the mother, whose eyes filled with tears as
                  she greeted him, though her thanks were expressed in a quiet, subdued tone, and
                  with that careful avoidance of all extravagance of phrase which none but a Quaker
                  matron seems wholly able to attain. Maurice remembered that he had been thanked
                  with four times as much <foreign xml:lang="FRA">empressement</foreign> by a New
                  York dame only the week before, upon the occasion of his bringing back a coral pin
                  lost by her at Frascati. He wished that Mrs. Winrow would leave them to a <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">tte-a-tte,</foreign> but she showed no signs of stirring. He was
                  longing to ask the young lady if she had told her mother and what the result had
                  been. Presently Mrs. Winrow glanced at the clock and said to her daughter, "Ellen,
                  this is one of thee meeting days, I believe,—isn't it? Thee ought to go, if thee
                  has taken that for thy choice." Miss Winrow colored slightly, and her mother went
                  on, addressing Maurice, "If thou wilt accompany my daughter, unless thou hast
                  scruples, I will take it kindly. She does not know how to find the English Chapel,
                  and I think she hardly ought to go alone." Maurice professed himself delighted and
                  that he had no scruples, and Ellen left the room to put on her bonnet. Two things
                  struck Maurice as strange. He noticed the correctness of the elder lady's grammar
                  when she spoke to him, and its constant error as she talked with her daughter. I
                  believe it is universal. I never knew but one Quaker who did not, in the bosom of
                  the family, use the objective for the nominative of the personal pronoun. With a
                  stranger many will be scrupulously accurate. The second thing was the utter
                  unconventionality of the whole proceeding in selecting him for her daughter's
                     escort.<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7264-00000047"/> Miss Winrow returned in a
                  moment, and with her came her brother. "Thomas will go with us," she said to her
                  mother, who gave a half sigh, and then replied, "Yes, he will learn the way to
                  wait upon thee in future, but not to go in." The young man's face lightened
                  considerably at his escape from what he evidently felt to be a penance due to his
                  neglect the night before. "I will wait for thee, outside, Ellen," he said; and the
                  three left the hotel together. If the reader knows the thoughts and ways of
                  "Friends' Society," the explanation of the above arrangement will not be needed.
                  For the uninitiated it will be necessary to add something.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Winrow did not wish her son to enter the doors of the English Chapel. She was
                  too conscientious to keep Ellen back, and she saw less harm in trusting her
                  daughter to the care of a stranger than her son to the perversions of that Church
                  which is looked upon with a traditional but special disfavor in the tenets of
                  Quakerism. As a matter of fact, the Church is most congenial to these good people;
                  only by tradition and the Book of Discipline they are bound to hold it
                  anathema.</p>
               <p>Ellen had her own feeling of the proprieties, however, and she had insisted on
                  having her brother's escort. That young gentleman expressed himself artlessly
                  enough over his good luck.</p>
               <p>"Mother needn't be worried about me. I'll go and smoke a cigar in the square, and
                  if there is any music in either of the churches there, I'll look in. She doesn't
                  mind my going to the Catholic churches: but sis, I'll be sure to be on hand when
                  thee comes out; it is now quarter to eleven, and it will be twelve before thee
                  wants me." He kept close beside his sister, however, till they reached the door of
                  the English Chapel, which is, or then was, just outside the Porta del Popolo.
                  Maurice thought him immensely <foreign xml:lang="FRA">de trop,</foreign> but to
                  his surprise Miss Winrow spoke freely. "You see, Mr. Maurice, I have told my
                  mother, and she at once decided thus. You know that to-day is Ash-Wednesday, and
                  all good church people keep it."—"But how did your mother come to know that?"—"She
                  was once engaged, she told me, before she married father, to an Episcopal
                  clergyman, but her parents broke it off, and I think she knows a great deal about
                  the Church, but she feels it would not be right to think of it now. She told me
                  this this morning, when I told her what I said to you last night. She said she was
                  more grateful to you for advising me as you did, than even for bringing me home
                  safe. From something she half said, I could not help fancying that it was some
                  concealment on her part which broke the engagement. Poor mother! it was a trial to
                  her, but not so much nor in the same way I feared. But she begged me not to try to
                  influence Thomas, and I have promised I would not, and—only think—she gave me
                  this." As she spoke, she put the little prayer-book Maurice had noticed that she
                  was carrying into his hands. It was a little volume somewhat worn, with a tiny
                  cross stamped, but not gilt, upon the cover. Upon the fly-leaf was written,
                  "Hester Archer from A. H. S., Easter Even, 1821." This was in faded ink: below it
                  the mother had pencilled, "Hester Winrow to her daughter Ellen," and Ellen had
                  added the date, Ash-Wednesday, 18—. They reached the chapel entrance. Maurice had
                  not thought of going to church that day; but feeling a strong hope that the
                  brother's care of the young Quaker would be as remiss as on the previous night, he
                  very cheerfully declined the invitation of the latter to wait outside and to
                  stroll on the Pincia. So he went with Ellen, and was rather surprised to find the
                  bare, uninviting interior quite full. They, however, succeeded in finding a place
                  quite near the extemporized chancel. Maurice was not so strange to the usages of
                  the place but that he could imitate his companion in her quiet act of private
                  prayer, and it composed his thoughts. The white-robed priest entered, not the
                  usual chaplain, but a slender, pale, and tall man, whose face impressed Maurice at
                  the first glance with a sense of power. Still more did the full, rich tones of a
                  voice exquisitely modulated and pervaded with a sad solemnity, in entire keeping
                  with the penitential service. Maurice had no difficulty in finding his places, for
                  the little hands which held the book before him pointed at once to the proper page
                  and line, and the low voice of Ellen came truly in with every response, save only
                  where the English book was varied from the one she held. All through to the close
                  of the Litany, the spell of the service grew deeper and deeper.</p>
               <p>But neither of the young Americans were prepared for what followed when the
                  clergyman rose from his knees, and the congregation with him, and after a moment's
                     pause,<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7264-00000048"/> began the Commination Preface.
                  Miss Winrow turned the leaves of her prayer-book confusedly, then closed it and
                  remained listening. But the ear of Maurice had caught the first sentence and moved
                  him to attend further. "Brethren," the priest said, "in the Primitive Church there
                  was a godly discipline, that, at the beginning of Lent, such persons as stood
                  convicted of notorious sin were put to open penance and punished in this world,
                  that their souls might be saved in the day of the Lord, and that others,
                  admonished by their example, might be the more afraid to offend."</p>
               <p>So natural was the manner of the clergyman that Maurice could hardly tell whether
                  it was an extemporized exhortation, or read from the book. It was not until he
                  entered upon the comminatory sentences that Maurice determined the point, and then
                  his next neighbor, a lady in black, put into his hand one of the Chapel
                  prayer-books open at the proper place.</p>
               <p>Maurice was soon in a strange conflict of feeling. Used to the soft and soothing
                  words of the Cambridge Unitarianism of his day, to hopeful utterances about the
                  progress of the race, the beautiful ideal humanitarianism which has presented
                  perhaps as never so well before the perfection of the Lord's nature as man, his
                  spirit rose in intense rebellion against the uncompromising old Hebrew
                  denunciations. Nor was his mood soothed by the imploring, yet warning address
                  which followed. He unconsciously stood more erect than usual, as if bracing
                  himself against it. But those ringing, searching tones right out of the heart of
                  the speaker, not in routine formality of customary service, but poured forth with
                  the tremulous eagerness which made the eye lighten, and the slight gesture of the
                  hand, scarce lifted from the desk cushion, instinct with all a prophet's
                  fire—these bore him in spite of himself along the tide. And when all sank upon
                  their knees with that instinctive habitude which the Church makes so natural to
                  her children, and which is so unlike the hesitating or wilful fashions of
                  Independency, and together began the Miserere, Maurice could keep back his voice
                  no longer. For let humanity be what it might, he was personally conscious of the
                  fact of sin; the remembrance of many an ill-spent hour came to haunt him. Tears
                  unbidden gathered in his eyes, and twice ere the service was ended his voice, in
                  spite of all his young man's shyness and wilful reserve, faltered almost to
                  pausing with scarce controlled emotion.</p>
               <p>It was a positive relief when, after the gospel for the day, the priest began to
                  announce the order of the Lenten services. Daily prayer was to be at ten and five,
                  and then some special services were mentioned, the meaning of which utterly
                  escaped our young Harvardite.</p>
               <p>When this was over, Maurice thought surely he will not attempt to preach! but
                  giving out a couple of verses of a hymn, he knelt down at the altar during the
                  singing, and, then at its close, standing just behind the chancel rail, began to
                  speak. Maurice half-listened as one who hears with the outward ear only, until his
                  wandering thoughts were called back by one short sharp
                     sentence—"<emph>Sorrow</emph> for sin is not repentance. That means turning
                  back. He who is lost in the desert is sorry, but if he will not lift his eye to
                  the star, or cast it downward upon the compass, but persists in tracing the weary
                  round of his own footsteps, his sorrow will not bring him to safety. <emph>He who
                     is adrift upon a plank in the midst of ocean</emph> is sorry, but if he will
                  make no signal to the passing bark or raise his voice in entreaty, he will not be
                  taken to the haven where he would be. He is not seeking to be saved. All men are
                  sorry after wrongdoing, but not all with the godly sorrow that worketh repentance.
                  Men who doubt are not happy in their unbelief, but they may be content. Men who
                  sin are not happy in their sinfulness, but they do not repent until they seek to
                  forsake. Penance is not penitence. It is paying an old debt with a new promise. It
                  is going to the debtors' prison in order presently to be discharged bankrupt; it
                  satisfies no creditor. Suffering does not atone. Were those eighteen upon whom the
                  tower of Siloam fell sinners above all that were in Jerusalem? I tell you nay, but
                  except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."</p>
               <p>How much more Maurice heard, he never could rightly say, but this brief extract
                  took strong hold upon him. He went silently forth with the young Quakeress and
                  turned homeward. By the obelisk in the centre of the Piazza del Popolo they found
                  her brother, not sulky precisely, but evidently bored to the last point of
                  endurance by long waiting. "It is two good hours you have been in there,<pb
                     n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7264-00000049"/> sis—it is worse than yearly meeting. Come
                  and have some lunch—you must be half-starved," said he. "I must go home, Thomas,"
                  said the young lady. "Oh, I didn't mean you, sis," said he, half blushing; "it
                  isn't like Parkinson's here, where one can take a lady; but Mr. Maurice—he has
                  earned the right to something." Maurice was half-inclined to accept. He did not
                  fancy his companion, but he was ready, as your traveller of a year's experience is
                  apt to be, to fraternize with any one who is decent, knowing that nothing is
                  easier than to shake off a troublesome companion unless he have a home mortgage on
                  you, in the which case it is difficult. He felt that the young man was anxious to
                  show him some attention for what he had done the evening previous, and that he
                  could hardly, in courtesy, decline without some excuse. "After we have seen your
                  sister home, and I have been to the hotel for my letters," he said, "perhaps I
                  will." They walked a few steps further, when Miss Winrow put her little
                  prayer-book into Maurice's hand, pointing with her finger to a particular line. He
                  read the designated words—"Days of Fasting: Ash Wednesday and Good Friday." "But,"
                  said he, answering her thought aloud, "I am not an Episcopalian." "You will be,"
                  she answered; "nothing else will satisfy you—something tells me you will."</p>
               <p>However, Maurice found the excuse he was thinking of converted into a real reason
                  when he got his letters. One was from Frank Goodstowe's uncle and former guardian,
                  to whom he had written the news of Frank's death: Frank, it seems, had left quite
                  a large property. The will deposited in New York had been destroyed by fire, but
                  there ought to be a duplicate, or else one of later execution, in Frank's own
                  keeping. It was necessary that Maurice should return and bring that, and attest
                  that it had been in his charge. The letter contained an order on the American
                  Steamship Company for a passage in the Liverpool steamer of June, and an ample
                  draft for all travelling expenses incurred by the journey, and the promise to make
                  good the cost of revisiting Europe again. But very urgent reasons were stated for
                  Maurice not to delay his home-trip later than June, Maurice found he should have
                  just eight weeks left to visit Naples, to pass Holy Week in Rome, and to return by
                  way of France to London, if he expected to have a fortnight to spare in England.
                  So he resolved to start immediately for the South of Italy, and therefore spent
                  the rest of the day in packing, having his passport visd, and in doing up such
                  odds and ends as the best trained tourist always finds loose at an unexpected
                  summons.</p>
               <p>He wrote a brief note to Miss Winrow to say that he should not see her again
                  unless she was in Rome during Holy Week, and excusing himself from a half-implied
                  promise to attend the morning service the next day at the Chapel.</p>
               <p>He found at the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">table-d'hte</foreign> that evening an old
                  college friend—two or three years older in standing than himself. They met and
                  greeted heartily. Langdon, for that was his name, had been in a German university,
                  and intended to return in the autumn to take his doctor's degrees.</p>
               <p>It is four weeks after that Ash Wednesday, and we have passed from the narrow
                  streets of Rome to the lovely landscape which one looks upon from the crest of the
                  height of St. Agatha—the beautiful bays of Naples and Salerno. Two young men are
                  sitting gazing upon it, and drinking in the soft languor of the spring atmosphere.
                  They have been making the most of the previous days, and have visited every point
                  in the scene before them. They have climbed Vesuvius painfully, and slidden down
                  its cone dustily and gleefully; have laughed at the Hermitage, have stood in the
                  depths of Herculanean excavations, and in the Forum of Pompeii. Capri, where they
                  spent such a charming day, floats midway between the blue heavens and the blue
                  sea. There across the bay is the classic Cape of Misenum; far to the south he the
                  three wondrous temples of Pstum, in the midst of the malaria-haunted marshes; and
                  close beneath their feet is the long glen at the head of which stands the famous
                  monastery of La Cava. All these they have seen, and more yet which must pass
                  unchronicled. They have been draining the cup of Neapolitan enjoyment; one day,
                  the vivid life of the most stirring streets in Europe; the next, the petrified
                  repose of those streets upon which for eighteen centuries nearly oblivion has
                  brooded. As in Rome one's thought naturally turns to Religion, so in Naples it
                  turns as naturally to History. In Rome there has always lingered the tradition of
                  that ancient Etruscan<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7264-00000050"/> tribe which flung
                  itself like a gauntlet into the midst of the Alban peoples—and this, in spite of
                  Virgilian epics and Livian romance, has stamped the permanent homogeneous
                  character upon the Eternal City. Changes innumerable have indeed passed over her,
                  but underneath all there is the one stern elemental instinct of domination. Rome
                  is the parent of the papacy—and the papacy out of Rome is an anomaly and a
                  failure. But Naples is full of history. One sees the Grecian traces everywhere;
                  then the influence of Asian voluptuousness and Egyptian mystery; and then suddenly
                  into the midst leaps the Norman Crusader, and marks out his realm by the sweep of
                  his sword-point to north, south, east, and west. The young men in their daily chat
                  had been going over these matters. Maurice, with the enthusiastic romance of a
                  young scholar, caught by the surface glitter and glow; Langdon, with the far
                  deeper, more accurate learning, the result of his three years' study in Germany,
                  withal digested and made ready for use with the clearness and quickness of the
                  American brain. Without any dogmatic overbearingness, but simply by the force of a
                  clearer understanding and a wider knowledge of the facts, he had established over
                  Maurice a great unconscious influence. The dreamy languor of noontide was upon
                  them. Maurice was pulling off the orange flowers from a bough he held in his hand,
                  and Langdon quietly peeling the fruit of the same. To-morrow, after four weeks of
                  constant companionship, they were to part—one for the Orient, one for the West.
                  "Just think of it, Langdon—two months hence and I shall be in America, and you in
                  Jerusalem or Damascus." "Yes, I suppose so. I wish we were to change places," said
                  Langdon. And the fair-haired, broad-browed young American stretched his athletic
                  form lazily. "I am rather worrying to get to work, but I must 'do' the East. I
                  hope to get a chance at Cairo and the Nile, though it is fearfully late; but then
                  hang Palestine; I expect to be bored with monks, and relics, and Bible-stories, at
                  the cost of six dollars a day and the chance of Syrian fever." "Why do you go,
                  then?" "Oh, I want to work out on the spot <emph>my</emph> theory of the mythical
                  origin of Christianity. You see, at Tbingen our professors were keen enough to see
                  that for all Strauss was right, he was terribly to seek in one thing. He hasn't
                  accounted for the New Testament writings."</p>
               <p>"No, I should think not. Men don't write a history of an imaginary personage who
                  never was."</p>
               <p>"Don't they though? I should think you had never read of Pius neas, or of Odin, or
                  of King Arthur. However, there the books are and must be accounted for. Now there
                  are two things I never could reconcile: the miracles, which can't be received, and
                  the character of Jesus Christ, which I do not believe is a forgery of priestcraft.
                  The men who could invent such an ideal must be themselves a miracle. The puzzle to
                  me is how this religious idea—for I still reject the notion of any real
                  personality of Jesus of Nazareth—has become the perfect mover of man's
                  aspirations. Somehow the Hebrew mind was peculiarly fitted to bring out that
                  thought to perfection. The troubled state of the whole world as it came under the
                  Roman yoke resulted in a determination of all impure humors to the one centre at
                  Rome. There was among the small ascetic sects of Palestine a wonderful purity and
                  simplicity, and all this suddenly seems to have freed itself from other elements,
                  and crystallized pure and perfect about the ancient Messianic legends. Now the
                  historic fact is that there were many Christs, and the probability is, that out of
                  these different claimants to the title and the hereditary throne of David has been
                  made up the legend as we have it. The fact in the gospels that one belonged to
                  Bethlehem, the other to Nazareth is alone conclusive. Luke and Matthew won't
                  square upon the same platform any way."</p>
               <p>"But what do you say to the miracles—how can you take one part and not another of
                  the story?"</p>
               <p>"Allegory—my boy—allegory. You don't know how entirely the Eastern mind wraps up
                  all truth in that shape—just as they always bury all the coin they get. Its
                  instincts are all esoteric. The difficulty is to get the key, and I think I have
                  it. These books, you know, in any event must have been written after the events
                  they describe—you admit that." Maurice never had thought of that before, having
                  the hazy Protestant impression that the Church was somehow born with the Bible in
                  its hand. However, he said, "Yes," not very well seeing how he could say "No."</p>
               <p>"Very well, then; there are two things to account for—the Church, which must have
                  been first in existence, and<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7264-00000051"/> then the
                  books. The parsons all fall back upon the miracles, according to Paley and Butler
                  and all that. But we, who reject the miracles, have another course to take. The
                  Church is established, a Hebrew ascetic sect founded on this legendary expectation
                  of Messiah. Nothing more natural. The books are written in the interest of
                  different parties in that, Now one has only to get the state of parties in that
                  era, to have the key of the miracles in their allegorical bearing. Now for that we
                  must go on to the first clear historical point where Paul comes on the stage. He
                  was a man of first-rate abilities, a great man, young, and in the prime of his
                  powers. He was an extra-Palestinian—that is a Jew who believed in the nationality,
                  but not the locality of the nation. There was a great deal of party spirit over
                  that point, Stephen the martyr was put to death in that quarrel, and Paul was in
                  that business. At first, though, he was on the Palestinian side—that was
                  Gamaliel's influence, no doubt. He continued on that side till the Damascus
                  journey. He found himself betrayed by the people in power in the Sanhedrim. The
                  fact was, he was too vigorous and rising a man for those old gray-beard plotters.
                  So just at the gate of Damascus he is struck down by one of his own troop bribed
                  to assassinate him. He is rescued and carried into the city, and there the
                  plotters, who have failed of their first stroke, conceive the brilliant idea of
                  disposing of Paul and throwing the odium of it upon the Christians."</p>
               <p>"But who are the Christians?" said Maurice. "Oh, this Messianic sect. It is a sort
                  of jacquerie at first, a peasant revolt against the tax-gatherers and the Romans.
                  Then out of it has grown a secret association founded on the belief that their
                  lost leader has returned to life. That is one of the universal myths you know, and
                  just the strongest possible bond of union. Moreover, they are a fixed fact to be
                  assumed for the present, one of the phenomena of the time. Well, Saul of Tarsus is
                  delivered to them. He is a Pharisee, and the Sadducees had got the better of him
                  for the time. While he lies there wounded in Damascus, in the hands of the
                  Christians, Nazarenes historically at that time, who evidently suspect the trap,
                  and think the best thing is to let him get well if he can, he comes to a really
                  magnificent conclusion. You see you owe no fealty to people who stab you in the
                  back. He will therefore abandon his old party, and he will turn the tables on
                  them, using their very attempt most effectively. He puts himself into the hands of
                  the Nazarenes. He sees that Jerusalem is doomed. Hitherto he has had a conflict of
                  duties. He is a Jew, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; he is also a Roman citizen, a
                  Tarsite, a Cilician. The extra-Palestinian policy will reconcile these two. And he
                  will make use of the Nazarene order to carry out his plans. He learns their
                  principles, and at a glance takes in the enormous capabilities of the league. The
                  Jewish people shall survive, but no longer as a nation,—the Empire will never
                  permit that; nor as a tributary province,—Hebrew pride forbids, but as a secret
                  society. Such an association, based on Oriental ideas, can do what it will. So he
                  seizes at once upon its fundamental legend,-of the rising from the dead of
                  Jesus,—and uses it to account for his own change. No mortal hand struck him down,
                  he says. He is theirs to live and die in the faith of their dead Leader, whose
                  resurrection he thus testifies to. The order at once feels his presence and
                  leadership. He goes into Arabia, in the hope of stirring up the pure original
                  stock of the Hebrew people. He fails there. That work was reserved for Mahomet.
                  However, he gains experience, and turns to bring in the foreign Jews in Syria and
                  Asia Minor, and that with some success. Now, however, he comes to an issue with
                  the Jerusalem; party, who are still clinging to the old Palestinian notions. He is
                  too politic, however, to break with them; temporizes, submits, professes to
                  consult with them, but sees their impracticability and narrow-mindedness. He
                  conceives the gigantic idea of swamping them in the order, and of extending that
                  beyond the Hebrew race to the Eastern Gentiles. He finds that the foreign Jews are
                  too few and too scattered,—too much under the spell of the old Mosaic and Davidic
                  institutions for his purposes. Well, he seizes the time when Peter—always rash and
                  headstrong—has made advances to the Roman soldiery in Judea. Peter's idea—not a
                  bad one, only impracticable—is to make proselytes of the gate from the
                  legionaries, and thus to have the army, or a part of them, in the control of the
                  chiefs of the order. He actually initiates the centurion Cornelius. Paul takes
                  that up, and Peter is caught in his own trap.<pb n="102-103"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000052"/> Now here, at once, are two allegories of the
                  gospels in plain view: Peter walking upon the water and sinking, and his cutting
                  off the ear of Malchus. For you see we come to the time of the gospel writings.
                  Matthew, the wisest and most learned of the original council of twelve—the number
                  of the tribes, you know—has written a history of the earlier legends in the
                  interest of the Jerusalem party. Paul gets Luke to write a counter-statement, in
                  behalf of the Gentile movement. Peter, finding his own influence imperilled,
                  starts Mark upon the same business. Only, you see, he must keep well with the
                  whole society and all parties; so that account is constructed upon the principle
                  of avoiding all controverted points. Then Paul attempts a wider range. He follows
                  up Luke's first pamphlet with a second, of which the main part is the history of
                  his own connection with the Church. And especially in that he is most artfully
                  designated as the Apostle to the Gentiles, with a sort of headship of the
                  extra-Palestinian branch. And this course of his he carries on with ever more and
                  more of magnificent audacity and genius, equal to all emergencies. It is perfectly
                  splendid."</p>
               <p>"But, Langdon, what do you make of St. John's Gospel?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, that is the work of John of Ephesus, John the Presbyter, or, perhaps, written
                  in the interest of a later theology. You see, of course, the idea primitively,
                  that of political rule in Judea, gave place to a religious idea after Jerusalem
                  passed away. It is the Hebrew Eleusis—must have a mystery at the bottom of
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Well, but there are the Beatitudes, the Sermon on the Mount—you believe in them,
                  surely?"</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, after a sort; only these seem to me to embody the theocratic ideas of
                  Israel. It is just a homily to the Jewish people, to induce them not to revolt
                  against the Romans, but to keep quiet and obey the old commandments. and God will
                  repeat for them the old Egyptian tradition. That very sermon Luke breaks up into
                  fragments, and scatters about his Gospel, in order to destroy just that very
                  application of it."</p>
               <p>"But," said Maurice—much bewildered by this new style of handling the Scripture he
                  had always more reverenced than read—"seems to me you make St. Paul anything but a
                  good man."</p>
               <p>"Oh, he was as good as his age. He was, primarily, full of the order. It is a most
                  instructive history, the gradual development of his policy; how from a zealous Jew
                  he gets fairly into the other extreme, from the simple widening of his point of
                  view. Judaism is sacrificed on its own altar. He says he became all things to all
                  men. But what a splendid genius! I read his Epistles continually; the most perfect
                  of gentlemen, brave, far-sighted, utterly regardless of self; the prototype of
                  Loyola, or, rather, the great ideal both of the Jesuit and the Crusader. He took
                  up there at Damascus the poor little starveling sect of Jewish malecontents, and
                  made of it a power the end of which is not yet."</p>
               <p>Maurice was both pained and perplexed, but he could not reply satisfactorily. They
                  talked all the way as they slowly sauntered down the heights to their inn—the
                  delightful "Iron Crown," at Sorrento. They sat late into the night hearing, but
                  not heeding, the murmur of the waves washing the base of the cliffs beneath their
                  room. Langdon brought to bear upon the discussion a mass of critical scholarship
                  that Maurice could not cope with. He was familiar with the Greek Testament in all
                  its readings, and illustrated his dazzling paradoxes from a storehouse which
                  seemed to contain the buried treasures of classic antiquity. He was entirely in
                  earnest withal, though utterly given over to the spirit of criticism, which is
                  sublime in dissection, but can achieve no other result than to fling upon the
                  table a heap of nerves, and bones, and muscles, and to say, Behold what was once a
                  man.</p>
               <p>But out of this he had essayed, like Frankenstein, to build up his monstrous
                  giant. Maurice, while borne along the tide of his eager rhetoric, felt dimly the
                  perception of something through it all of real truth and vitality, and that made
                  its hold upon him the more pitiless. Certainly he had gained a new insight into
                  the New Testament Scriptures. He had a sense of a vivid, consecutive, and
                  impassioned history, such as he had never before suspected, in those pages. Darkly
                  there shone, through these wreathing mists of the young skeptic's talk, the image
                  of a primitive church, upon whose topmost spire was lifted into the light of
                  heaven the Cross.</p>
               <p>His spirit demanded, though his intellect could not shape the demand, an adequate
                  and central motive. He gained<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7264-00000053"/> from that
                  hour a purpose with which to read Scripture with interest, if nothing more. He was
                  approaching the Church from the pure heathen stand-point; and, like the earnest
                  heathen of old, a voice within, faintly heard, hardly understood, was calling
                  him.</p>
               <p>They sat late into the night; but when Maurice went to his bed-chamber he grasped,
                  almost instinctively, his prayer-book. He opened to the Second Sunday in Advent,
                  and his eye fell upon that collect. He read it slowly and reverently, half aloud;
                  and then—as one under the fast gathering spell of coming illness struggles against
                  it—said, firmly, "I <emph>will</emph> believe, I <emph>do</emph> believe," and
                  turned the page and read the Apostles' Creed. It seemed to calm him and relieve
                  him, he could hardly tell how or why, and he slept quietly.</p>
               <p>The next day they went up to Naples together, and Maurice parted with Langdon, who
                  embarked in the steamer for Malta, while he himself, that same afternoon, took the
                  diligence for Rome.</p>
               <p>His first attempt at a solution of this new class of difficulties was to look for
                  Gardiner. He was no longer in Rome. He found, indeed, Mrs. Gardiner and Miss De
                  Forest there still, but they could give him no hope of meeting with their
                  relative. A vacancy had occurred at Florence in the English Church, and Gardiner,
                  considering the services of Passion Week too important to be lost, had consented
                  to give up the splendid pageants of Rome, in order that he might afford to a score
                  of tourists and a few permanent residents in Florence, the services of the
                  Church.</p>
               <p>Then he went to call on the Winrows. Ellen was out with her brother. Then,
                  restless and perplexed, he went once more to the Church of the Gesu. He inquired
                  for Father W——, the American priest. He was absent at Frascati, where was a sick
                  countryman. So he went home, and did what he might have known was the only way for
                  him. He undertook to study out the matter for himself. It was a good thing for him
                  to do. He gained at least something like a knowledge of the unity of the New
                  Testament plan. Slowly and very imperfectly, but still with a great awakening
                  power, he convinced himself that no such mere worldly idea lay beneath the New
                  Testament history as Langdon had set forth. But traces of a church began to show
                  themselves,—only, unfortunately, he was but too slightly acquainted with the real
                  points at issue to see how the Scriptures bore upon them. Only one thing came
                  clearly out, and that was the independence of the different books, both in point
                  of date as well as in composition. He noted a good many matters for future study;
                  and then, after a week so spent, he turned to that gorgeous succession of
                  ceremonies which begin with Palm Sunday, and end with the Easter fireworks.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>BRYAN assisted at the services of Holy Week in the midst of a jam and crowd of
                  tourists which was not at all edifying. He saw the indefatigable English charge
                  from the foot-washing of the pilgrims to the feeding, breaking through in a dozen
                  places the line of Papal soldiery. One burly Briton in a Windsor uniform actually
                  used a couple of ladies, as did his ancestry the revolving scythes on their
                  chariot-wheels, sweeping from their unhappy little legs the astonished military,
                  and through the breach so made poured the irresistible sight-seers. What little of
                  religious idea was left in the midst of these elaborate performances was
                  effectually extinguished by the noise and bustle and irreverence of the gathered
                  tourists,—most of them members of a Church that at that very season was in sadness
                  and solemn humiliation commemorating the most important events in the Lord's
                  life.</p>
               <p>Easter Sunday dawned clear and bright. Maurice would have gone to church with Miss
                  Winrow, but he wished to see the blessing of the people in the great piazza before
                  St. Peter's. So he witnessed High Mass, and tried hard to understand something
                  about it, and then took his place in the shadow of the colonnade and waited. At
                  high noon there appeared upon the balcony the venerable figure of Rome's latest,
                  perhaps last Patriarch-Bishop, and every head was uncovered. The French army of
                  occupation and the Roman troops of the line were drawn up in front. As the Pope
                  appeared, the officer in command waved his sword, which flashed brightly in the
                  sunlight, and with the marvellous precision of military movement, every musket was
                  grounded, every knee bent. That alone would have made the spectacle magnificent;
                  and coupled with the thought of the powers of war submitted to the authority of
                  the religion of peace, it became thrilling. Perfect stillness reigned in all the
                  vast area, so that even at the elevation of the balcony the Pontiff's voice was
                  distinctly audible. Maurice may yet learn to pronounce himself the Apostolic
                  benediction, but he can hardly in life forget that moment of intense emotion. One
                  impression was clear amid the tumult of his thoughts, that he must in some way
                  find admission into the bosom of the Christian Church. He was further off than
                  ever from becoming a Romanist,—he had no definite views as yet,—the old
                  self-sustaining, independent instinct of Unitarianism was still unsubdued; but
                  this his parting from Rome was, unconsciously to himself, the beginning of a new
                  life. From Christmas to Easter he had undergone a very important change. His habit
                  of looking at religious subjects was materially, radically altered. He came again
                  to that same square that evening, and saw one by one the long threads of light
                  from innumerable lanterns mark out the whole <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >faade</foreign> of the huge church, until, as the twilight deepened, it stood
                  a glowing skeleton of silvery fires. Then suddenly a torch soared like a star
                  aloft to the top of the cross, and everywhere the building seemed to become a sea
                  of tossing flames. The dome became transformed into the likeness of the triple
                  crown, and the former illumination paled as the glow-worm spark beneath the glare
                  of a meteor. Nothing in the whole <foreign xml:lang="FRA">repertoire</foreign> of
                  Rome's melodrama of devotion is so superb as this. To be sure, twenty lives are
                  annually risked, and, as the alternative, daring criminals purchase pardon and
                  freedom for new trespass for their night's work. This the traveller does not
                  see—he only enjoys and is amazed.</p>
               <p>Easter Monday Maurice staid for the fireworks on the Pincian Hill,—another superb
                  spectacle,—ending with the girandole, or flight of thirty thousand rockets at once
                  into the air.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>

               </note>
               <p>The next morning before daylight he was on his way to Civita Vecchia. From thence
                  his journey was as rapid as he could make it,—through France, only pausing a night
                  in Paris to rest, and after a weary week he found himself in London late Saturday
                  night. The next Sunday he went to<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7264-00000055"/> the
                  Abbey in the morning, where the choral service happened to be performed very
                  shabbily, and a very indifferent sermon was drawled out to a thin congregation,—a
                  state of things which, in this present year of grace, would be found marvellously
                  changed for the better. In the afternoon he somehow found his way to the new and
                  elegant Irvingite church, where he witnessed a splendor and solemnity of ritual
                  that very much moved him, and in the evening went to the respectable old St.
                  James', Piccadilly, where he heard a most capital sermon. The face of the preacher
                  was familiar, and after a time it came to him where he had seen it before. It was
                  the preacher of Ash-Wednesday at Rome.</p>
               <p>"Who was it preached?" said Maurice to a pew-opener as he passed out.</p>
               <p>"That was our Rector, sir, the Rev. Mr. K——; he always preaches Sunday nights,"
                  was the answer given with, a tone of suppressed pride.</p>
               <p>Monday mornings Maurice was busy in procuring various little matters for his
                  voyage. He decided to leave most of his luggage in London, and only to take what
                  he needed,—meaning to return after a month or two. He went to C——'s well-known
                  book-store in the Strand, and was asking for any Irvingite publications they might
                  have, when a hand was laid upon his shoulder. He turned and met a Cambridge
                  friend, a Unitarian minister of some eminence, who had been temporarily filling a
                  post in the Divinity School during Bryan's college days, and, being a very genial,
                  warm-hearted man, had often dropped into the young senior's rooms to chat over
                  literary matters. He of course asked Maurice concerning his plans. Maurice was
                  going to Oxford the next day. Mr. D—— proposed to accompany him.</p>
               <p>"Well, my real object," said Bryan, "is not Oxford—I've seen that—but an Oxford
                  man, to whom I have letters."</p>
               <p>"Oh, never mind that: it is very little use taking letters to these Englishmen;
                  but you'll have time enough for him and me too. I have some letters, and we can
                  make a joint business."</p>
               <p>Maurice was tired of solitary travel, as any man will be after a week of it, and
                  was easily persuaded. So Tuesday evening found them sitting at dinner at the
                  "Mitre," that ancient and Orthodox hostelry, where they partook of their
                  refreshment under the eye of a party semi-clerical in attire and stately enough
                  for a Bishop—whom the Rev. Mr. D—— frankly confessed to Maurice afterward he could
                  not bring himself to regard as a waiter.</p>
               <p>The next day they sallied forth to present their letters. Maurice's was to a
                  Fellow of Oriel, the Rev. ——. He was received with great courtesy; but just as the
                  Englishman was about to cast the letter by, a sentence in it appeared to arrest
                  his attention. "Excuse me a moment," he said, and read the whole over again very
                  carefully, evidently discovering that this was no formal letter of introduction.
                  The first question he asked was: "How long have you to stay?"</p>
               <p>"I must be in Liverpool Friday night; unexpected business calls me to America; but
                  I return in the autumn, I hope."</p>
               <p>"Dear, dear, how unfortunate! Gardiner writes me as only he could write, for he
                  knows that his lightest wish would be law with me, and now it is out of my power
                  to do what he wants done. What I had proposed, for he has written me from Florence
                  about you, was to take you out to my curacy as my guest for six weeks or so. Then
                  we could go over the whole matter seriously. I am engaged now almost every hour
                  till next Sunday, for really I did not look for you quite so soon, and have been
                  making it my business to get my work out of the way so as to be ready for you. I
                  can take you to dine in Hall, and get a friend to show you the lions and all that;
                  but as for the other matter, it would be folly to begin. I am sorry, so sorry; I
                  never was so sorry for anything in all my life. You couldn't now, could you,
                  manage to put off your return?" He looked in Maurice's face with a longing look of
                  entreaty, as if he and not the young American were the obliged party.</p>
               <p>Maurice pondered a moment, and then said—"No; it is a friend's business which
                  calls me; and it is connected with a law affair, a will, which I must prove in the
                  courts personally."</p>
               <p>"Very well, then, we'll make Oxford pleasant to you now. You'll dine with me
                  to-day, and breakfast with me<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7264-00000056"/>
                  to-morrow. Come td chapel at five, and then we'll go to Hall together. Now, if you
                  will excuse me, I must be off. You had best visit some of the colleges to-day.
                  I'll just take you now and put you in a friend's hands for that you know."</p>
               <p>So Maurice was given over to the charming hospitalities of Oxford, and enjoyed his
                  three days to the full, but got no opportunity to make the inquiries he wished. On
                  the contrary, he did see something of the very opposite set, to whom D——'s letters
                  introduced him, and heard considerable of very unsettling "Broad Church" talk. He
                  got the impression that there was a large party in the English Establishment which
                  was chafing at the restraints of the Articles and inclined to interpret Scripture
                  very laxly, and he could not help feeling that the latitude of construction these
                  men claimed for their own vows was a good deal akin to that Jesuit casuistry he
                  had heard at Rome.</p>
               <p>Then the constant reference to the power of Parliament struck him unpleasantly. He
                  had heard the Anglican Church called a State Church in his controversial studies
                  at Home, and here he found its members advocating a still wider authority of the
                  civil power.</p>
               <p>The brief days were soon over, however. He found himself once more at the Waterloo
                  Arms in Liverpool, that quaint and comfortable resting-place of the just-landed,
                  that bustling dreary abode of those who are to set sail on the morrow; and the
                  next morning, bright and early, he was on board the tug going alongside the
                  magnificent American steamer Mystic, the swiftest and most comfortable of those
                  unrivalled vessels that for a season outsped the fleetest keels of Great Britain.
                  As he stepped aboard, his hand was grasped with a hearty shake, and in a
                  semi-naval uniform Stuart stood before him. It was a glad surprise; and still
                  another was in store as the boat came off again, and the Winrows—father, mother,
                  and daughter—were among the passengers.</p>
               <p>The second night out was a little rough, and Maurice was glad to forsake the cold,
                  wet deck for Stuart's cheery little state-room. It was his watch below, and the
                  young officer, throwing off his monkey-jacket and cap as he came in, gave Maurice
                  a hearty welcome. He then returned to Maurice Gardiner's gift, the prayer-boot
                  loaned him, with many thanks.</p>
               <p>"Do you know that has taught me my duty?" he said, as he laid it on the table
                  between them. "And I've done it, too, as I said I would. I found that the Bishop
                  of Chester was to confirm this last week, in his own cathedral. So I got leave and
                  ran down to Chester; and a friend of mine, an English parson, had me presented;
                  and I've been confuted and taken the Sacrament, and I feel twice the man I was
                  before. I wish you had been with me. Now, if anything goes wrong, I can stick to
                  my duty without flinching. You see every true sailor may have some day to go with
                  his ship, and I want to have something to keep me true and brave when the last
                  order comes."</p>
               <p>Maurice gave a weary sigh. "I am more adrift than ever," he said, "but my doubts
                  must not trouble you. When I get home, I mean to have the matter out, but here on
                  board ship one cannot."</p>
               <p>Curiously enough, he had been looking forward to just this time in which to go
                  over his religious troubles at leisure, and when it came, he was shirking the
                  question most of all. He looked half enviously at Stuart, and then nervously
                  turned the subject, nor did he speak of it again.</p>
               <p>It was just the same with Miss Winrow, with whom he was constantly meeting and
                  talking whenever her mother's sea-sickness permitted the daughter to leave her. He
                  never could bring himself to talk with her upon those former topics, and when she
                  led toward them, he turned the subject adroitly. This feeling of avoidance
                  deepened as a more personal interest sprang up between them. He gave himself up to
                  the business of pleasing her, and, as is the case the world over, "<foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">Semper ubique et cum omnibus,</foreign>" he more and more
                  pleased himself. Still, though talking of pictures and travels and the sights of
                  all sorts which day by day were left further behind below the eastern horizon,
                  ever and anon a reference would be made to the time of their acquaintanceship. But
                  her advances were not met. Under the influence of a new feeling, not yet strong
                  enough to require the aid of the celestial to guide the steps of the terrestrial
                  love, his restlessness of mind was subsiding, and his search after-things divine
                  seemed to lose its interest.<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7264-00000057"/> The
                  American atmosphere seemed to be, with the flag above his head, once more claiming
                  his allegiance to practical thoughts and things. He was going back to New England
                  scenes and ideas. As the idea of a possible love for Ellen Winrow rose to tangible
                  reality in his mind, the notion of returning at once to Europe lost its hold. He
                  would go back to Cambridge and study law or general literature, and if this came
                  to anything, he said to himself, with a light flush coming to his cheek as he sat
                  at night in his state-room, he might make a new effort. He could take his wife's
                  church as a matter of course, as other men did, without being a member of it.
                  Somehow this compromising way of having the question settled for him was very
                  alluring. Only, after all, nothing was decided yet. It was pleasant to enjoy these
                  talks upon the deck, and the passing day-dream; meanwhile, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >vogue la galere</foreign>—he would see where it ended; and at the worst, if he
                  should be mistaken either in his own mind or in hers, why, he could go to Europe
                  again, and gratify his old longing for the East and for the desert life. <q>

               <p>On the eighth day of the passage, the Mystic ran into the dense fogs which hang
                  along the Banks. The steamer's speed was not slackened. They dashed along under
                  the thick weltering cloud, shut in from sea and sky within their little moving
                  circle amid the seas. There is something peculiarly dreary in this. Everything
                  drips, the decks are wet, the cabin damp, the air chill as in a vault, and the eye
                  obliged to rest inboard for every object save a few feet of sullen waves. Maurice
                  rose early from the dinner-table that day, and went forward to the smoke-stack on
                  the upper or spar-deck, where, in the warm lee of that huge column, was the only
                  comfortable place to be found. He was looking abstractedly over the lee bow, the
                  steamer then heading west by south, when all at once the fog seemed to gather in
                  one particular spot just ahead, and he caught the glimpse of a driving sail. In
                  the same moment a warning shout came from the seaman at the Mystic's
                  bow—"Starboard your helm—starboard ha-a-ard!" as there came into view the head
                  sails of a ship close-hauled. Quicker than it is possible to write this sentence,
                  the bowsprit of the stranger crashed upon the starboard bow of the Mystic, and
                  with sails all shaking, and with a wild cry of terror in some foreign tongue
                  coming up from her deck, she swung into view abeam; then, as the way upon the
                  Mystic carried her irresistibly ahead, fell off again into the gloom—but not
                  before she was seen to be a large propeller, her bowsprit a shattered stump, with
                  a mass of tangled rigging fallen across her bows, her foretop-gallant mast gone
                  over to leeward, and every appearance of a fearful wreck upon her, as the result
                  of the collision. The captain of the Mystic was instantly on deck, and in a brief
                  moment the steam was shut off and a boat manned and lowered, pulling in the
                  direction of the stranger. Unconscious of any injury to his own craft, he was
                  taking every measure to rescue the imperilled crew of the other ship. The faint
                  toll of her bell came through the fog in answer to the whistle of the Mystic, then
                  the dim flash and muffled explosion of a gun. One man had clambered on board the
                  Mystic in the moment of collision—a frightened Frenchman, who, in broken English,
                  gave the name of his vessel (a screw steamer out of St. John's), and declared that
                  she was in a sinking condition. The captain was just ordering another boat
                  lowered, and the excited passengers were straining their eyes into the fog to
                  catch a glimpse of the other vessel, when Stuart, whose station was on the
                  forecastle of the Mystic, was hurriedly addressed by one of the watch. He came aft
                  at once, and whispered to his commander with a very grave face, just as a
                  terrified waiter rushed up from below, exclaiming, "The steamer is sinking." Wild
                  confusion followed. The first mate was absent with the boat already lowered, and
                  the crew missed the accustomed authority. Two of the junior officers were new to
                  the ship. Orders were hastily given and countermanded. Maurice hurried to his
                  state-room, took his money and all Frank's papers, and secured them about him,
                  with such trifles as he most wished to preserve; and then, seeing Frank's
                  prayer-book, thrust it into his bosom beside the one which Gardiner had given him,
                  which he had in his pocket. Then he returned on deck to a little group of ladies
                  who were asking anxious questions, and did his best to calm them. Stuart, looking
                  very serious, was at his post, clearing away the small brass gun which the steamer
                  carried. The<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7264-00000058"/> sharp explosion followed,
                  startling everyone. Sobs, cries, and wild prayers were heard.</p>
               <p>Bryan hastily threw himself amid a group of excited male passengers, and urged
                  every man to make an effort for their safety. The captain appeared upon the
                  quarter-deck calm and collected, and ordered the life-boats and quarter-boats
                  lowered. The crew, obedient to the instinct of discipline, placed themselves at
                  the falls, and the remaining boats were safely in the water when a frantic rush of
                  waiters, firemen, and engineers from below was made. In vain the officers tried to
                  control them. The divided authority then prevailing in the Atlantic steam service
                  bore its fatal fruits. Maurice, with others of the more self-possessed passengers,
                  endeavored to stem the torrent. It was useless. The frightened crowd rushed into
                  the boats; capsizing one, which filled instantly, and was swept under the
                  steamer's counter; and crowding the others to the waters edge, pulled hastily away
                  from the steamer now momentarily settling in the water. Stuart gave a grim smile.
                  The captain, who was faithful to the last, went forward to make one more vain
                  attempt to get a sail over the bow which should stop the leak. The calm of despair
                  settled upon those who remained on board. Stuart continued to load and fire his
                  gun, in the faint chance of attracting a passing sail to their rescue. In the
                  intervals of this duty he got a chance to exchange a word with Maurice.</p>
               <p>"We've not half an hour more to float. Help to cut the lashings of these light
                  spare spars, and start the doors from the state-rooms—everything that will float.
                  Those who can swim may have a chance. I go with the ship. Jones," said he to one
                  of the crew, "you and Waters get a couple of axes and get the roof of this house
                  on deck clear; it will make a raft for some of you." The men obeyed, and worked
                  desperately. But the copper fastenings and bolts of the splendidly built steamer
                  defied their efforts. Stuart also directed Maurice to unhook and cast loose the
                  guys of the spanker-boom, and had the studding gaft lowered and cut clear. Some of
                  the men had got down the foretop-gallant yard and rested it across the forward
                  deck. Nothing more could be done.</p>
               <p>Maurice turned to Miss Winrow, who, with her father and mother, were sitting
                  quietly on the edge of the cabin skylight.</p>
               <p>"We are in God's hand," was all he could utter.</p>
               <p>"We are in God's hand," she replied, "and He will take us to Himself. I did not
                  think to die so young, but father and mother are with me, and I pray God that he
                  may yet save you to His service. Something tells me He will. Goodbye, and do not
                  forget me then."</p>
               <p>"Never, if I live, but I would rather die with you. Miss Winrow,—Ellen," he said
                  in a sudden agony at the thought of separation, "what can life be to me without
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"Hush!" she said, "hush, not now! I cannot tell what might have been," and a sweet
                  pure, look came over her young face. "I have thought of you, for we girls see when
                  we are thought of by others, that, if it pleased Heaven to let us be one, I could
                  have been very happy: but we must not speak of these things now. I"—</p>
               <p>A wild, hoarse cry rang from the seamen on the bow as the Mystic gave a sickening
                  lurch beneath them.</p>
               <p>"Father, mother, dear—"she cried, as every one on the decks started to their feet.
                  Maurice long remembered seeing—as though he saw it not, for he had then no thought
                  save for Ellen Winrow—Stuart calmly running out his gun once more and applying the
                  loggerhead to the touchhole. The explosion was in the midst of blinding spray,
                  just as a wave broke upon the gunwale of the steamer and swept across the deck,
                  driving the groups resistlessly asunder. Bryan was borne off his feet. Flinging
                  his arms out instinctively, he struck the boom he had cut loose from its fasts and
                  clung to it with the simple instinct of self-preservation. The waters closed over
                  them, and both spar and man went down in the mighty indraught of the sinking
                  steamer.</p>
               <p>It seemed ages, though it was but a few moments, when the spar rose again to the
                  surface. He shook the water from his face, drew a long breath, and gazed about
                  him. Only a few fragments of wreck were floating here and there. There were no
                  signs of the friends he had parted with. The captain was upon a piece of the
                  paddle-box at a little distance; and as he rose upon a wave, he thought he saw one
                  or two more. A fathom or two of the signal halyards were still attached to the
                  boom-end, and Maurice worked along<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7264-00000059"/> the
                  spar till he secured them and lashed himself securely. Night was fast coming on,
                  and though once or twice he heard voices and the dash of oars, he called in vain.
                  The mate had returned with his boat and was picking up the surviving few, but
                  Maurice was not seen; and soon the sullen wash of the waves was the only sound
                  heard by him. He struggled to keep his consciousness. He thought of many things,
                  of the words of the preacher of Ash-Wednesday, now so singularly illustrating his
                  own case. All through the night he heard sounds of bells and guns and voices
                  calling him, but could not tell whether these were the cheats of his own brain or
                  realities. Then he had a faint recollection of the rolling away of the fog and a
                  clear sky at dawn, into which the sun rose, which was the last remembered
                  incident. He hung helplessly in the lashings, his head luckily clear of the water.
                  When he awoke, he was in a berth. At first he thought the whole a dream, and that
                  he was still on board the Mystic; but there was no jar of machinery, only the
                  light dancing motion of a small craft; and the half-conscious wandering glance
                  that he gave showed him the little cabin into which he looked was not his
                  state-room. A rough-looking, gray-haired, gray-bearded man was sitting watching
                  him.</p>
               <p>"The Lord's name be praised!" Maurice heard him say. Then something was put to his
                  lips of which he drank mechanically, and sank away into sleep again. When he
                  roused again, he found himself weak, but refreshed.</p>
               <p>"Where am I?" he asked in a feeble voice.</p>
               <p>"Safe aboard the Eliza Jane, fishing-schooner of Marble-head. Don't talk now, but
                  eat a bit, and then we'll get you on deck and hear about it."</p>
               <p>An hour later Maurice was on deck. The sun was, low in the western horizon.
                  Maurice looked into the binnacle, and saw which way the vessel was heading. She
                  was a little schooner of less than a hundred tons, with everything set that would
                  draw, and dashing merrily toward the American cost. The old man stood at the
                  tiller, steering by the mere swaying of his tall body against the helm, as it
                  seemed. One or two wondering faces of young men were turned toward them, but no
                  questions were asked. Two more young men were busy forward.</p>
               <p>"Well, my lad, and how d'ye feel now? You're looking a bit more rugged," said the
                  skipper. "When we picked you up this morning, there was less life in you than
                  there is now. Bless His holy name for that. You were lashed to a spar that to my
                  eye had the look of a spanker-boom, and the lashings we cut you loose from was
                  part of an ensign halyard I sh'd jedge. What has happened? You were n't the only
                  one adrift when that spar went overboard?"</p>
               <p>Maurice told his story briefly. Exclamations of wonder and pity burst from the
                  lips of his hearers. Maurice begged them to put back and try to rescue some
                  others.</p>
               <p>"We've done that, my lad, a'ready. We stood on the starboard tack a good two hours
                  after we picked you up, and saw plenty of floating wrack; a boat,—one of these
                  new-fashioned iron life-boats,—bottom up, but no living thing except yourself; and
                  if God Almighty had n't sent back the breath o' life into you, it's little we
                  could have done. Bless His Holy Name! Amen!" said the captain.</p>
               <p>"The steamer Mystic; two hun'erd lives lost! The Lord's ways are unsarchable."</p>
               <p>Maurice was too weak and excited to talk much; and the kind old skipper made him
                  he down on the deck, and covered him with a monkey-jacket. And there he lay,
                  neither waking nor sleeping, nor able to think much, but resting, and slowly
                  struggling back into strength.</p>
               <p>When night fell, they made him go below, and, after some supper, helped him to
                  undress and turn in, as tenderly as if he had been a child. And then the old
                  captain, evidently doing what he had done daily for years, took a well-worn Bible,
                  and worked slowly through a chapter, one of the Psalms; and then knelt by
                  Maurice's berth-side and offered up a prayer of thanksgiving, not forgetting in it
                  a petition "for them poor souls o' Thine yet mebbye floating upon the lone waters;
                  and that, if it was Thy will, those whom Thou hast so suddenly called to their
                  account was ready when the time come." So Maurice slept once more.</p>
               <p>The next morning found him all himself again. When he got on deck, he found the
                  old man ready to talk with him. One of the crew was set to steer, and another was
                  acting as cook; and there was not much else to be done about the little craft,
                  which was still skimming homewards.</p>
               <p>"Excuse my asking," said the old man, as they sat together on the sunny lee of the
                  companion-way, while<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7264-00000060"/> he puffed away at
                  the blackened stump of a pipe,—"but have you known what it is to get religion?
                  After such a marvellous goodness of the Lord's showing, surely He has work for you
                  in this life."</p>
               <p>Maurice a month ago would have turned aside the question, but he could not
                  here.</p>
               <p>"I don't know," he replied, thoughtfully. "I do feel very serious and very
                  grateful; and I was thinking last night, if I got home, I would give myself to His
                  service—if I could find how."—</p>
               <p>"Well, let an old man tell you, sir. You're college la'arnt, I guess, and such as
                  you can do a sight o' good if you will. I know'd He called poor fishermen, like
                  me, to be fishers of men; but called also Matthew that was at the receipt of
                  custom, and Luke that was a physician, and Paul, he that was laarned in all the
                  laarning of the world; and now has n't He called you, in saving you out of the
                  great deep? I ha'n't a hard thought agin Him for making me what I be—a rough
                  fisherman of the Banks; but if I'd had my way when I was young like you, I'd have
                  gone to college and been a preacher o' righteousness and the blessed Gospel. It
                  wa'ant to be, and that's why I'm here now. But when I sat watching you breathe
                  just and no more.——Steady, my son—steady. The wind's more out of the nothe of east
                  and heading us a little. Keep her full-and-bye. For'ard there, just trim the
                  jib-sheet a little flatter. Well, the jib-sheet, well, all!—As I was a-watching
                  you, the thought come to me, like as't were a call from God's voice a-speaking in
                  me, to bid you go and preach the Gospel. For it kinder seemed to say to me," and
                  here the rough features worked and a strange yearning look came into his face,
                  "that here was the chance I'd been longing for all my life. I lost a boy, might be
                  like you he would Be now, whom I always meant to make a minister of,—and many's
                  the dollar I've laid up for him,—but he took sick and died when I was on a vy'ge
                  to Canton: they said some of them it was studying too hard. But I never had no
                  other. These is my sister's sons; but they 're like me, Bank fishermen,—good boys
                  and steady enough, but just made for the sea. But seein' you, I feel as if God had
                  give me a life when I picked you up; for <emph>He</emph> sent me to do it. I'll
                  tell you now how it was, if you won't think it an old fellow's yarn; for it's the
                  living truth before the Lord.</p>
               <p>"The day before we picked you up, we had the wind blowing fresh from the west' and
                  about two pints no the of west, so that we were beating up against it
                  close-hauled. We were then on the edge of the fog-bank, and our best course was,
                  plain as day, to keep on the larboard tack and head southerly,—especially as the
                  wind was hauling and giving us a chance to lay a better course every minute. Any
                  child could see what was to be done, yet I wa'an't easy in: my mind and couldn't
                  get easy, do what I liked, and by-and-by I just put the helm down and told the
                  boys we'd go about. 'Why, father says my nephew Tom there,—he's my sister's son,
                  but his father was lost at sea when he was little, and the boys mostly call me
                  father,—'why father,' says he, 'that tack will knock us two pints off our course
                  and take us into the fog beside.' I knowed it as well as he did, but I just give
                  any kind of an answer that he'd see afore we was done, and then I stuck her down
                  to the starboard tack, come what would. I could see the boys look at me as if they
                  couldn't make out what I was at, and twice I got ashamed of myself for being so
                  superstitious like, and then I went about, but I couldn't feel easy, and the third
                  time I says to myself, 'There's something in this. I haven't this load off my mind
                  for nothing;' and then I just gave no thought about it. Now I know, sitting here
                  by you, who never came aboard us when we sailed out of port, what it was for that
                  I felt so, and I believe, just as sure as I believe in Him, that the Lord's got
                  work for you to do." He paused a moment and then said,—"Now I've got one favor to
                  ask you, and I can ask a favor after bringing you back from the gates o' death
                  into life, as you may say, by God's blessing. You ain't got religion yet. I can
                  tell that, for them that has knows; but just you pray for it to come, and don't
                  give up praying till it does come; and don't you mind my praying for you,—for I
                  must and shall,—for you're my son that the Lord's gi'en me back." He rose up from
                  off the deck and walked forward, leaving Maurice deeply moved.</p>
               <p>The young man slipped quietly below into the silent little cabin, and with bowed
                  head and bended knees prayed long and fervently. Light seemed to come to him. He
                     had<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7264-00000061"/> been sorrowing in his heart for
                  his lost love, though the knowedge and the loss had come almost in the same
                  moment. The selfishness of his old life fell off from him all at once. In broken,
                  scarce formed thoughts, without a definite creed, with little idea how practically
                  it was to come about, he pledged himself to God, and feeling the sense of a
                  personal Saviour, he vowed to serve Him, entreating Him to be merciful and to
                  forgive his past sins, and to take him as His disciple.</p>
               <p>When he returned to the deck and his eyes met the gaze of the old seaman, it was
                  with a look that told all.</p>
               <p>"God be praised! it has come to you," said the old skipper, "I know it. You don't
                  need to tell me, for we mightn't understand each other; but I see it. And now
                  Eliza Jane, you huzzy!" cried he, slapping his hand upon the low rail, "let's see
                  you walk your sweetest, for we must sight Cape Ann lights by sundown.</p>
               <p>"It's blowing freshish, Tom, but I guess we can stand getting the staysail on her;
                  if it goes, why it's only a halyard parted or a main-topmast sprung. Get it up,
                  you and 'Lish, and bend on that new halyard out of the after-port locker."</p>
               <p>Under the added sail the little craft fairly sprang from sea to sea, and as the
                  evening damp thickened the canvass, every sail stood like a board. The slender
                  topmast buckled like whalebone, and the lee-shrouds slackened into long bights,
                  but everything held; and as the darkness came down upon the waters, the keen eye
                  of the mariner caught the well-known gleam of the light-house. "Ease her off, my
                  son, a half pint; let the main sheet draw a little!" And so at racing speed, with
                  the spray flying over the sharp bow, and a long wake of foam seething astern, they
                  drew near the dim shadowy outline of the coast, and when the full moon rose red
                  and round out of the east, they made out the rocky headlands of Marblehead harbor,
                  and by midnight were gliding slowly to their anchorage before the slumbering
                  village. With the dawning, Maurice was on the shore, and bidding a hearty good-bye
                  to his preservers, and forcing upon them some keepsakes from the little trifles of
                  jewelry he had been able to save, was on his way to Salem and the railroad to
                  Boston.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <p>THE reader must suppose himself again advanced over a space of several weeks. The
                  scene is now Nahant, and two gentlemen are sitting in the twilight upon the rocks
                  in front of the hotel, watching a young man who slowly strolls away from them
                  along the cliffs in the direction of the Spouting Hose.</p>
               <p>"Well, Professor," began the elder of the two, a rather portly, handsome man,
                  somewhat florid in complexion and ministerial in attire—"well, Professor, what do
                  you think of our young friend there—will he do?"</p>
               <p>"He must do," was the reply. "We want something decent in the Divinity School
                  terribly. The last lot were regular sticks—the fag-end of their class in college.
                  The set before were men at whom even the Faculty looked queer—so dreadfully
                  erratic. I don't think it wise to draw the line too narrowly, of course, but
                  Parkerism is just swamping the school."</p>
               <p>"Young Maurice isn't in that way at all, I should say."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no; quite the reverse. In fact, there is where the trouble lies. He is too
                  orthodox by half, I fear. He had a notion of going to the Episcopal Seminary in
                  New York, if there is such a thing—only I doubt if he knew how to set about it—but
                  he <emph>was</emph> going to consult Dr. ——, the Puseyite parson at St.
                  Polycarp's. That would never have done; he would have been drawn in in a moment;
                  but I got him, instead, an interview with Swivel, who is half minded to turn
                  Presbyterian himself. It succeeded charmingly. Swivel insisted, just as I knew he
                  would, that ultra-Calvinism was the real teaching of the Thirty-nine Articles, and
                     <emph>that,</emph> you see, was more than our young friend could swallow."</p>
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7264-00000062"/>
               <p>"Very good; but how did you know that Swivel would say that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I knew by what he said to me when I"—He stopped, blushed, stammered, and
                  then, seeing himself in for it, said, "I may as well be frank: I did think of the
                  same thing a year or so since myself, and so you see I was pretty sure what Swivel
                  would say. Then I caught him on the rebound. I showed him that Unitarianism,
                     <emph>true</emph> Unitarianism, only refused to <emph>define</emph> the nature
                  of the Saviour and his relation to the Father; that we, in reverence for that
                  relation, shrank from the Episcopalian dogmatism, which sought to fix it. I said—I
                  am afraid I went pretty far there—that we did not <emph>exclude</emph> them from
                  sharing the Christian faith—only forbade them to exclude others; that we rested
                  upon the simple terms of Scripture. Then I talked to him of the Church of the
                  Future; how, when relieved from all these old-world trammels, it would grow to
                  possess all liturgies and ordinances and churches, unrestricted by canons and
                  rubrics and conventions. I thought I was sure of him, only he asked me quietly if
                  I knew the difference between a canon and a rubric. I said Of course but did not
                  venture to state it. Then I took him to the Convention, the Episcopal Convention,
                  you know, It was a bold stroke; but, as luck would have it, the Bishop was not in
                  the chair, and a very undignified squabble was going on between the presiding
                  officer and one of the brethren. What with this and with that I got my lamb out of
                  the lion's mouth, I <emph>think.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; but Professor, why take all that trouble? If he finds out how you have
                  managed, you will lose him altogether; and, besides that, what do you want of any
                  one who has to be kept in the dark to prevent him from turning orthodox?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I am not sure, I don't believe pretty much as he does; and then I was
                  determined to keep him out of the hands of these Episcopalians. They are the dog
                  in the manger. They won't let anybody else belong to the Church Catholic, and they
                  won't join it themselves. We could keep on terms with all the other bodies, by
                  dropping the name Unitarian, but there they stick with their precious prayer-book,
                  right in the way. Our people will not swallow that, with its Litany and Trinity
                  Sunday and Nicene Creed. What I said about the Church of the Future I do hold to,
                  and I think it can be done; we can use the Episcopal polity quite as well as the
                  Methodists, and who is to stop us from using any liturgies we like, only we must
                  not be crowded on the creeds. The tide is setting that way just now, and if we can
                  only borrow their boat, we'll leave them high and dry on the shore."</p>
               <p>"Well done, Professor; tell it not in Gath, however," said the other, with a
                  laugh.</p>
               <p>"No, no! You mistake me; I am serious. You have no idea how the Divinity School
                  has drifted since you and I were graduated there. While I have been west,
                  everything has changed; and before I go back to Titus to my professorship, I
                  intend to recruit a few young men of the right sort. The set there now are either
                  stupid as codfish, or else fellows whose whole study is to pull the Bible to
                  pieces, and to ridicule it,—sentimental, lazy chaps, who take to the ministry as a
                  pretty profession. If we can only get a few young men with reverence and ability
                  combined, we can make a movement. If not, let me tell you that in thirty years or
                  so from now, when you and I are gone, Unitarianism will be dead and buried."</p>
               <p>"Seriously, my dear old chum, if that be the case, why try to save it? I do not
                  hold with you. I love it, for it delivered me out of the bonds of a dead
                  Calvinism; it gave me life in the glorious liberty of the Gospel. It gave me a
                  living and loving friend in Jesus, instead of a mere abstract middle-term in the
                  problem of man reconciled or atoned with God. I do not care, as you say, about the
                  ancient creeds. I can take them well enough, if I may take them my own way, but
                  into that horrible prison-house of Trinitarianism I will not go."</p>
               <p>"That is just what I am trying to save us from Parkerism is killing us inch by
                  inch, and we shall be forced back into the old paths, unless we can put that down.
                  That is why I make such an effort to get young men like this Mr. Maurice."</p>
               <p>"And how have you succeeded?"</p>
               <p>"As far as this. He has promised to go to Cambridge. I have arranged for him that
                  he shall enter as of the second year,—he did read there six weeks men leaving
                  college,—and that will bring him through a year from next June.<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000063"/> That weighed with him. He is terribly impatient for
                  action. I told you his history this morning, you know. That has left him very
                  restless, and I think a little melancholy, as well it might. Moreover, he is tied
                  up in this country for a year by some law matters, in which he is a witness for a
                  friend of his who died in Rome."</p>
               <p>"You think then, that"—</p>
               <p>"Hush, here he comes."</p>
               <p>Maurice, looking older and paler, through the indescribable impress of a great
                  grief, came up to them.</p>
               <p>"I have decided, sir. If the Church of my fathers can be a church; if she can
                  unite the two things I love—law and liberty—I will stand by her. I have been
                  thinking over what you said about our Church acting as the reconciler of a divided
                  Christendom—ready to give up Congregationalism and Puritan forms to the
                  Episcopalian, and conceding to the Orthodox original sin, and to the Methodist
                  sudden conversion, and to the Baptist his theory of immersion—and it is worth
                  trying. I saw Dr. Cuthbert yesterday, of St. Simon and St. Jude's Church, and he
                  rather dissuaded me from the Episcopal ministry. He said that he should
                     <emph>advise</emph> my going to Princeton, but that I better remain a nominal
                  Unitarian, fighting against Parkerism, than give myself up to the pettinesses
                  which he says are reigning at the New York Seminary. He says they are all going to
                  Rome. But one thing, Professor, I wish to know before I commit myself. You simply
                  say that you deny the authority of a synod packed by Coustantine to force upon the
                  Church <emph>any</emph> creed. You do not require me to deny that creed on its own
                  merits—at least the divinity of my Saviour."</p>
               <p>The young man slightly bowed his head while speaking; there was an embarrassed
                  pause. Presently, however, the Professor's friend came to the rescue.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, certainly not; only to hold back from all positive statements outside of
                  Scripture, as surely unauthorized. By the way, I can show you clearly that the
                  Athanasian Creed was never written by him, but is clearly a Latin forgery."</p>
               <p>"Very well," said Maurice. "I am a liberal Christian, that is, I do not believe in
                  the compulsion of creeds, and I will go to Cambridge next week."</p>
               <p>Six weeks more have passed, and Bryan Maurice is sauntering tering up the lovely
                  avenue leading to Divinity Hall. The building he enters bears little likeness to
                  the glorious colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, but is less like a barrack than the
                  other structures where "ingenuous youth" abides in the New-England University. He
                  ascends to the second story, unlocks his door with a pass-key, and enters a
                  moderate sized but cheerful chamber. Upon its walls arc hung a few colored prints
                  of Italian scenes, a very good lithograph of Salisbury Cathedral, and a
                  single-line engraving of rare finish—"a proof"—from, Hunt's "Light of the World."
                  A bookcase of plain shelves of stained deal nearly fills one, end of the room.
                  Over his narrow iron bedstead there is placed against the wall a plain wooden
                  cross; Lexicon, papers, &amp;c., are strewn rather confusedly upon the table. He
                  seats himself by the pleasant window overlooking the pathway he has just come,
                  takes up a book, but does not seem inclined to study. In fact, he falls into a
                  reverie—a practice which has rather gained upon him of late. He began fiercely to
                  acquire such theology as was ready to be taught there, and enthusiastically to
                  make the acquaintance of his companions in study. There was, we suspect, a little
                  disappointment in both. Presently steps are heard in the entry; then a knock at
                  the door, and to his response, "Come in' enters a young man of perhaps twenty-two,
                  in a rather shabby dressing-gown, and slippers trodden down at the heels.</p>
               <p>"Ah, good-day, Blanchard," says Maurice, quietly, not over-eagerly, for he has
                  come to suspect his new friend will prove a bore. The new-comer throws himself
                  into an easy-chair, and gazes about the room. Plainly as it was furnished, it had
                  an unmistakable air of elegance and refinement. The colors of the carpet
                  harmonized with the table-cover and the curtains. The bindings of the books were
                  rich and costly, the lamp upon the study-table an elegant bronze, and the little
                  mementoes of foreign travel (some which Maurice had sent home by sailing packet)
                  disposed about the room were unique. A vase of flowers was upon the study-desk.
                  Blanchard's eye slowly mastered these details, and then, with a half envious sigh,
                  his thought reverted to the bare, close, and dusty room he had just descended
                  from. It was a thought born of the same mental comparison which spoke ill his
                  first remark.</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7264-00000064"/>
               <p>"Of course <emph>you</emph> won't in a hurry to take the first call that
                  offers."</p>
               <p>"Time enough to think of that when I graduate; here am I just in the school, and
                  not at all sure I shall go through."</p>
               <p>"Well, but," persisted the other, "you <emph>must</emph> think about it, only I
                  suppose you are easy enough with friends and influence. But it worries me all the
                  time. TAVO thirds of the last class are settled by this time; and of the rest, one
                  is going to be an assistant, and the other two did n't study for preaching, but
                  only to pass three years in Cambridge,—one is going to Germany, and the other is
                  waiting for one of the new college professorships. They all got places easy; three
                  or four old parishes fell vacant about the same time; one of the class was booked
                  beforehand for a Boston church, and only one had to go about candidating. There
                  can't be such good luck three years running, and there's five in the senior class
                  before our turns come, so you see it is serious."</p>
               <p>"Oh," said Maurice, carelessly, "I think it does n't signify. If a man has made up
                  his mind to preach, he can find places enough; the trouble with me is to know what
                  to preach, the where I'll leave till the time comes."</p>
               <p>"Well, but that is a trouble too. You can't tell. Last year's class were all for
                  Parker, but they say that the old conservatism is coming back again, especially
                  out West. I wish I knew what to go for."</p>
               <p>Maurice stared, hardly taking in the drift of the remark. Blanchard went on—"It
                  does n't matter to you, I suppose, but with me it is everything; if I can't get a
                  church, I must go to teaching."</p>
               <p>"Wise, my dear fellow, you're just the one I want to see," Maurice exclaimed, as a
                  slender, pale, intellectual-looking young man entered.</p>
               <p>"Well, Maurice, what is it you want me to see, or to hear me say?" And he
                  carelessly lounged on to the sofa, and, more by habit than with the intent to
                  read, took up a book.</p>
               <p>"I want you to tell me what I am here for," replied Maurice.</p>
               <p>"For eighteen months or two years, I suppose," said the other.</p>
               <p>"No,—but just tell me; I have been here six weeks. I came fully believing that
                  Unitarianism was the pure form of primitive Christianity, and that I ought to
                  spread and defend it. But here, where ought to be the headquarters of the faith,
                  they teach nothing definite at all, and everybody seems to believe what he
                  pleases."</p>
               <p>"Well, my boy, don't you see the advantage of that?"</p>
               <p>"No, I can't say that I do. It was only last night, in this very room, Spencer
                  declared that he did not conceive it of any importance whether one believed in a
                  personal deity or no, and that he regarded all doctrines concerning a future state
                  as snares to the soul."</p>
               <p>"We <emph>are</emph> rather loose here, that's a fact. I am sure I don't know what
                  I believe myself, only I think I am not quite so sure of what I <emph>don't</emph>
                  believe as Spencer is. Blanchard, here, believes the chief end of man—that is, of
                  theological man—is to get a call to a nice parish, and he is ready to preach
                  accordingly. You, I fancy, have a hankering after the pretty ways of the
                  Episcopalians, whom I detest, root and branch. Then we all believe," added he,
                  looking at his watch, "that it is time for the Greek Testament lecture."</p>
               <p>Maurice and the other rose, leaving Wise still lounging on the sofa. "I shall stay
                  here in your comfortable quarters; come back when lecture is done," he said.</p>
               <p>The two departed for the room of the exegetical professor. That gentleman was a
                  thin, spare man, somewhat bald, with a caustic, dry, and unreverential manner of
                  speech. The scholarship displayed in the recitation was good, at least upon the
                  part of the Harvard men, who formed two thirds of the class, but the exegesis
                  excessively bare and superficial. To exaggerate discrepancies, to discover
                  contradictions where none were, seemed to be the purpose of the lesson. The latter
                  verses of the lesson, which was the third chapter of St. Matthew, brought them to
                  the mention of the Holy Spirit's descent in the likeness of a dove. "What," said
                  the Professor, "do you understand, Mr. Jones, by the dove lighting upon
                  Jesus?"</p>
               <p>"We reject, of course," replied the pupil, with an air of glib satisfaction, "the
                  popular and legendary explanation which Matthew gives. The dove, as an emblem of
                  spiritual holiness, was seen to light on Jesus, and the populace fancy it to be a
                  miracle. There being no personality to the Holy<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000065"/> we cannot, of course, understand any embodiment of
                  it in an animal. Matthew is merely speaking to record the impression of the
                  multitude."</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir," said the Professor; "but that does not explain why the dove
                  should be hovering near a crowd of men, nor why it should have been specially
                  attracted to Jesus. We must take care that our innate unwillingness to receive the
                  fact of miracles does not lead us into inconsistencies. Mr. Mack, (turning to the
                  next, a heavy, dull, rustic-looking man, considerably older than the rest,)—Mr.
                  Mack, how do <emph>you</emph> meet this difficulty?"</p>
               <p>The neophyte of the theologic Eleusinia hesitated; the class stirred in
                  anticipation of the coming fun. When the lectures dragged, it was not unusual for
                  Mack to be put on. "Guess he saw a worm, sir."</p>
               <p>The class giggled, the Professor smiled, and gave himself the stock explanation.
                  "I apprehend, gentlemen, that the superior holiness of the Messiah attracted and
                  irresistibly impelled the dove to draw near to, Him, and overcame, in fact, the
                  natural timidity of the creature. This is not miracle, but simply unusual. With
                  the same perfection, we might be able thus to attract the inferior creation."</p>
               <p>"Professor," here broke in another,—"why, if the creative intellect is the
                  principle of life in all things, may it not be found throughout the universe?"</p>
               <p>"I don't apprehend the remark," replied the Doctor.</p>
               <p>"Well, I mean, if God is in all life, and all life centres in Him, why is not the
                  Spirit of God in that dove descending upon Jesus, just as God's thought dwelt in
                  him peculiarly, because he was a good and holy man?"</p>
               <p>"Hum,—ye-e-s, that is a novel and striking view," said the Doctor, a little out of
                  his depth.</p>
               <p>"Well, Professor," continued the pertinacious inquirer, "I want to bring about a
                  parallel with that case of Mahomet's dove. He was a great Eastern teacher also.
                  Now, Mr. Carlyle proves conclusively that he could not be guilty of a trick, so
                  that we reject the story of the dove's picking peas from his ear, and yet the
                  legend-rests upon too strong evidence to be denied. Mankind do not invent such
                  incidents. Mahomet was also a great world-soul,—an inspired, fiery-hearted, devout
                  man. Why is not his dove a second example of the same manifestation,—the sympathy
                  between Spirit of God in nature and the Spirit of God in holy men?"</p>
               <p>"Really, a new point; I will consider it," said the Professor. "Our hour is up,"
                  (looking at his watch;) and the class broke up.</p>
               <p>Maurice went to his room silent and disturbed. He wanted faith, and here was
                  general unsettlement. Wise looked up as he entered, and, reading the trouble in
                  his face, greeted him with a calm smile.</p>
               <p>"Old fellow, I've a great mind to throw this up and go be better, it can't be
                  worse."</p>
               <p>"I think not," said Wise. "You don't know Andover. Just drop that recitation, as I
                  have. Do your own studying; get some good Commentaries, and work
                  independently."</p>
               <p>"Then I might as well be at home as here."</p>
               <p>"No; here you have the atmosphere of study, such as it is." Wise added this last
                  with a significant shrug. "You have books in plenty, and, above all, your work,
                  and nothing else to do. Now, Maurice, I like you; you are not half so much afloat
                  as I am, and I am getting steadier, and one thing we can do, stand by each other.
                  The suspicion has crossed my mind more than once, that the old Orthodoxy, if one
                  understood it rightly, may be the thing. If it is, I would even turn
                  Episcopalian,—which I have always thought the in tensest humbug out,—rather than
                  stick to a lie, just because it is 'gifted' and 'spiritual' and 'intellectual and
                  all that. But I think there is no need of that. We can do better than to go
                  anywhere. I am a Unitarian by blood and birth. If the Church will keep where
                  Channing and Peabody and Ware placed it, I would not leave it for the world. We
                  must bring back their ways, and walk in them. They were loving and reverent and
                  earnest men. These fellows here now have neither clear convictions nor manly
                  purposes. They are just sentimentalizing or sneering. They are afraid to look a
                  question of fact in the face. What I want, is to know what is true. The Bible may
                  be the outgrowth of a local development of the religious sentiment in man, or it
                  may be a sacred and authoritative revelation. It does n't matter a button to me
                  how it shall turn out, only, let me know clearly which it is. But half the fellows
                  here go on, like Balaam's ass, between two blind walls of propositions, which are
                  assumed to be final. No<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7264-00000066"/> fear that they
                  will meet an angel to stop them by the way. On the one hand, the Bible must n't be
                  rejected, because that won't do; on the other hand, the supernatural can't be
                  believed, because it can't. There's where they are. I am ready, I say, for either
                  I can believe the supernatural, or reject the Bible, whichever is
                     <emph>right.</emph> And—and—I want you to stay here and help me find out that.
                  For the life of me I cannot understand why Unitarianism wants to ignore the
                  miracles, unless it is afraid that they will prove the Lord's divinity. I don't
                  say they do, for I don't think so; but if I did, I must say I could take the
                  Trinity as infinitely easier to receive than, an account which is based upon a
                  series of impossibilities, blunders, and deceptions, and cannot be received except
                  by cutting it to little bits. It is the weakest of subterfuges' said the young
                  man, springing to his feet and pacing the room. "There is Freeman,—Franklin
                  Freeman, you know,—who was—well, never mind what—in our junior year; he rooms next
                  me, and is everlastingly boring me about the moral beauty of the Lord's teachings
                  being something apart from the Lord's life, and saying that <emph>that</emph> may
                  have been a tissue of impostures, (he rather thinks it was,) without injuring the
                  spiritual worth of His words. The fellow,—I could kick him. I suppose he thinks it
                  a nice doctrine for some people nowadays,—as if it were possible for any living
                  soul to be a great teacher of truth, and be the while acting lies. The plain
                  English of this stuff is just this,—one or two of these fellows really mean it, by
                  the way,—that they intend to do about as they please, and to make pretty talk hide
                  ugly action; the rest all follow, for these men happen to be the ablest in the
                  school. Now this I am sure of. I am <emph>not</emph> sure that there is any
                  institution of the ministry; I am not positive that there is a God even. But I do
                  know that if there is a God, and if He calls, men to serve Him as clergymen, it
                  must be in no lying and dirty and selfish ways. Whatever His Apostles may have
                  preached, they did what the Lord said."</p>
               <p>"Why," said Maurice,—anxious to get out of his perplexed, disheartened state,—"why
                  do <emph>you</emph> always say the Lord, and never Christ, or Jesus, like the rest
                  here?"</p>
               <p>"Because if He was, and if the record is true, that is the way the Apostles did
                  almost always. But, Maurice,—to come back to the subject,—you see I appreciate
                  your little arts at pursuing an unpleasant topic;—don't go off. We have, at least,
                  one work to do here,—to raise this school out of the state it has fallen into, if
                  we can: the rest can wait. Stand by me, and I will by you."</p>
               <p>They locked into each other's faces a moment, and then, "I will," said Bryan
                  Maurice, and the two struck hands in the clasp of an equal and manful
                  friendship.</p>
               <p>One result of this morning's talk was to reconcile Maurice to his place.
                  Saltonstall Wise Was, as he said, wholly adrift, yet not weakly. He was a skeptic
                  in the best sense of the term,—an examiner, a trier. The influence of the two
                  young men was soon felt, much as they kept to themselves. They took to attending
                  some of the Law School lectures, and thus, in that strong, healthy atmosphere,
                  gained tone and vigor against the enervating sentimentalism of the Divinity Hall.
                  Upon one point Maurice fell back, after a cursory examination of the arguments
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">pro</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >con,</foreign> upon the high Arian doctrine. From that position he combated
                  the whole tendency of his surroundings. He decided that the Trinity was an
                  interpolated doctrine of the fourth century. With this exception, he struggled to
                  realize the catholic doctrine. One victory he soon obtained. He convinced Wise
                  that Episcopacy was the teaching of the New Testament. If, as in the days of
                  Arius, there were now an episcopate holding those views, he would have applied to
                  it for orders. What he yet failed to perceive was the existence of the Visible
                  Church, and its right to enlarge the ancient creeds.</p>
               <p>But he fought manfully against the rationalism around him. One afternoon, in a
                  classmate's room, the subject of the Lord's Supper was brought up.</p>
               <p>"My notion of that," said his companion, "is very much like this: You remember our
                  classmate Frank Goodstowe, the Parson, we called him, who died in Rome. Now,
                  suppose he had left a request to us, that on certain days, in order to remember
                  him, we should eat a piece of bread and drink a glass of wine: that would be a
                  sacrament, just as Jesus desired His disciples. That is all there is of it."</p>
               <p>Maurice sprang to his feet. "Look here, Willis!" he said; "I was with Frank when
                  he died, holding him in my arms when he received the Sacrament for the first and
                  last time,<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7264-00000067"/> and I would just rather die
                  on the spot than believe it to be no more than what you say. I cannot tell what it
                  is, but this I <emph>know,</emph> it is no such trifling as your definition makes
                  it." And Maurice marched out of the room, and did not return to it again for a
                  month.</p>
               <p>Strange to say, Maurice never had communed according to the Unitarian rite, and
                  his neglect to do so had never been noticed. The old Professor once or twice spoke
                  to him about it; but Bryan simply asked for further time, and his request was
                  granted. Wise took the same position, and so high was the personal character of
                  the two young men that they were not interfered with.</p>
               <p>They fell, moreover, into the practice of going upon Sunday afternoons to the
                  little Episcopal church across the lesser Delta, but as that did not interfere
                  with the hour of the chapel-service it passed unnoticed.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>THEN Wise and Maurice took to spending their Sundays in Boston. They fell, very
                  naturally, into the broadest eclecticism, which they made as stirring as they
                  could by well-arranged contrasts.</p>
               <p>Salstonstall Wise belonged to one of the "old" families, and the really old
                  Massachusetts families are of a capital stock, the best in existence—the English
                  country gentry, which, after a couple of centuries in the American hot-bed, has
                  ripened into a rare intellectual delicacy of flavor. The best performances, the
                  highest literary achievements, may not be found among them, in fact, rarely are
                  found where culture is uniform, but the best appreciation is. English authors are
                  beginning to find this out. So, though the rest of the United States may laugh at
                  the "hub" and pass worn-out jokes upon "modern Athens," there is never a writer in
                  this broad land who does not look to Fields' counter as his true court
                  presentation, and the "blue and gold" as the genuine court-dress, only to be
                  properly provided at the skilled <foreign xml:lang="FRA">atelier</foreign> of
                  Riverside.</p>
               <p>Salstonstall Wise had, of course, a Boston home, with a rich aunt or uncle
                  dwelling in Mount Vernon or Beacon Street, or in Pemberton Square, no matter
                  precisely which, and there the two young men always dined on Sundays. It was
                  rather a shock to their conservative Amphitryon, not to have their steady presence
                  in the comfortable old red cushioned pew beneath the shadow of the Federal Street
                  pulpit, and still more when their chat at the table disclosed that their morning
                  had been spent at High-Mass in the Romish Cathedral, or amid the intoned litanies
                  of St. Poly-carp, or listening to Father ——, the seaman Methodist preacher, or at
                  the Swedenborgian Chapel; or again in alternate visiting between the Music Hall
                  and "Brimstone<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7264-00000068"/> Corner," the Stone
                  Chapel and the Second Adventists, in an obscure market-hall. However, it was set
                  down for a sort of theological-wild-oat-sowing, and as Wise had a cousin who
                  rarely made his appearance at the Sunday dinner-table, and whose Sunday
                  occupations were by no means edifying, the old people concluded that young men
                  might do worse. It was preparatory to a staid settling down into the Unitarian
                  compromise. Unitarianism was growing restless just then over its ordinary fare and
                  craving new sensations. Perhaps it was well for young men, who were soon to have
                  congregations of their own, to know what was likely to attract, and the Unitarian
                  mind, like Prince Achille Murat over his turkey-buzzard, "having no prejudiz," was
                  ready to find palatable whatever could be cooked. Only Maurice would sometimes let
                  drop a word or two which showed a familiarity with Roman usages that made his
                  entertainers turn uneasily in their chairs. The Church of Rome is the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">bete noire</foreign> of "liberal" Christianity.</p>
               <p>Together the young men, especially in their evening walks out to Cambridge by
                  moonlight, or starlight, or lamplight, theorized abundantly over the Church of the
                  Future. A revived Episcopacy, with a liberalized creed and an expurgated and
                  enlarged Liturgy, made their favorite dream. As was natural, the more they
                  indulged it, the more they shrank from the commonplace, uninspiring life of a
                  New-England country congregation, such as they had to look forward to. Wise, to be
                  sure, had ample expectations, and Maurice present means, which put both beyond the
                  necessity of immediate work. But Maurice had the burden of his vows in the cabin
                  of the little schooner heavily upon him. He felt that he must seize the first
                  ministerial opening. Meanwhile, in rather a desultory manner, he was laying the
                  foundation of much information, and, of course, some knowledge. One bad habit he
                  was fast yielding to—that of simply keeping out of sight whatever was awkward in
                  history or Scripture. As an eclectic, he could do so; it was part of his creed.
                  "Interpolations," "Corruptions of the Fourth Century," were the rubbish-baskets
                  into which he shot all material discordant with his new plan. In this his friend,
                  the Rev. Turinell Hooper, who had been the means of persuading him to the Divinity
                  School, greatly aided.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Turinell Hooper was a man with a strong conservative bent, who had
                  nevertheless become fully committed to the drift of his position. His whole
                  attitude was that of resistance to the liberalizing tendencies of his communion,
                  but of course, whenever he took a strong brace, his feet would slide beneath him,
                  and the attempt to regain an erect position not infrequently threw him much
                  farther forward than he meant to go. Once or twice he had ingeniously turned the
                  interpolation theory quite cleverly upon his adversaries, and had set up some
                  brilliant theories Concerning the chief Unitarian proof-texts. He was
                  characterized among his brethren, as "an able man, but <emph>so</emph> bigoted."
                  Maurice passed much spare time in the minister's study. Mr. Hooper loved to read
                  to his young friend passages from the sermons he was preparing, and then, having
                  thus freed his mind, would turn with a sigh to the ungenial work of toning them
                  down to suit the weakness of his broad-aisle pews. He affected with his intimates
                  an ultra-ecclesiastical style of talk, and was profoundly severe upon the Puritan
                  axiom which regarded the Church of England as descended from the Church of Rome.
                  He was often called behind his back, "the Bishop of Boston." He really taught
                  Maurice a good deal of high Anglicanism upon the subject of the British Primitive
                  Church. It was from him that Maurice obtained the Oxford tracts, and some other
                  literature not known to the Cambridge course. Nevertheless, few traces of these
                  Saturday morning talks appeared in the Sunday morning Sermons, and his choir
                  having made rebellious speeches and wry faces at the innovation of sundry attempts
                  at chanting, the effort was dropped. He succeeded, indeed, in spite of one or two
                  sturdy dissenters, in persuading his congregation to sit during the prayers. One
                  or two old white-haired magnates rose for a while at the heads of their pews, but
                  as age crept upon them, were glad to rest their limbs. He only, however, could
                  induce a few, a very few enthusiastic young ladies, to bow their heads upon the
                  front of their pews. Maurice alone knelt one Sunday, and as he sate conspicuously
                  in the clerical pew, was accordingly commented on by the congregation in sundry
                  dinner-table talks.</p>
               <p>"I'm not going to be made an Episcopalian of," said one Athenian matron; "if I
                  want that sort of thing, I'll go to<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7264-00000069"/>
                  Trinity. I don't object to sit, especially when the weather is warm, but as for
                  kneeling? just like the Catholics——"</p>
               <p>So, in different ways, said pretty much all, and Mr. Hooper's experiment came to
                  nought.</p>
               <p>The winter rolled away, and spring succeeded with its dreary east winds, till of a
                  sudden burst upon them the bright, blooming, leafy June—the one bit of ideal
                  loveliness in the New England year. Maurice had tried, partly in memory of Ellen
                  Winrow, partly for its. own sake, to keep Lent, but there was no daily service;
                  and. Ash-Wednesday happening to coincide with an exhibition day at Harvard, he
                  found but a few scattered worshippers in the little church, and came out from it
                  only to be drawn into the College Chapel (the old one in University Hall) to hear
                  the oration by a senior, who was the crack man of his class, and, of course, the
                  hero of his day. The tyranny of university custom is strong, and then as the young
                  orator was another cousin of Saltonstall Wise, he had to go afterward to his rooms
                  in Holworthy to congratulate him, and then was forced to stay and eat oysters, and
                  salad, and ices amid a crowd of gay young girls. Being known as a student in
                  Divinity, the matronly element in the party made much of him, and with courteous
                  reminiscences of his own appearances on the College stage, promised to attend his
                  maiden sermon, and otherwise flattered and made much of him, It is all very well
                  for good readers to be shocked at this, but did you ever try to follow church
                  usages without being a churchman? So, when Good Friday and Easter came they passed
                  unnoticed, save by a regretful memory. In two things, however, the young man
                  remained unchanged. He was true to his dead friend and his lost love. He fought
                  shy of the intellectual belles of Boston, who would gladly have chatted with
                  him.</p>
               <p>However when May had come, and with it occasional warm and balmy days, came also
                  the anniversary meetings in the city. There was a general cessation of lectures
                  and recitations in the Divinity Hall, and the theological element of the
                  University strode or rolled over Charles River Bridge to do its part as speakers
                  or hearers in the grand eloquence of the platform. It was on a Thursday morning,
                  at about half-past eight, that Wise and Maurice alighted from the omnibus (for as
                  yet the horse-railroad was not) in front of the Revere. They passed into the hall
                  to summon a waiter, whom they were wont to fee, to take their overcoats and to
                  brush off the classic dust of Old Cambridge and the plebeian soil of the
                  "Port."</p>
               <p>"Well! where shall we go this morning, Brother M.?" said Wise.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I don't know. We heard Phillips yesterday, and Garibaldi Brown Tuesday, and
                  the elect generally on Monday. Let us have something new. Suppose, for variety, we
                  go to St. Polycarp's."</p>
               <p>"Come, that's a good move. I haven't heard a bit of Liturgy for ever so long, and
                  it will take the taste of those awful personal prayers of Freeman's and
                  Blanchard's out of one's mouth. Pity it isn't a Litany day, though."</p>
               <p>They started to go.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, gentlemen," said a young man of their own age who had been standing by
                  and overhearing them; "but you are too early; service will not be to-day before
                  half-past ten—Ascension Day, you know."</p>
               <p>"Oh," said Maurice, "then we had better go to the Bible Society meeting."</p>
               <p>"No, no," said Wise; "if it is all the same to you, I had much rather not. We can
                  go to Copeland's for an ice, and then it will be time. Much obliged to you, sir,
                  for your information."</p>
               <p>The stranger bowed, and turned away into the reading-room, and they noticed as he
                  went that his dress was clerical.</p>
               <p>"Never mind the ice-cream," said Maurice. "I want to go to Ticknor's. Books before
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bonbons.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Very well, books be it." And so the next hour slipped away in that fascinating
                  old two-story shop on the corner of School Street, where so many hours have been
                  killed and bright thoughts born. Wise had just laid down a, book and Maurice taken
                  out his watch when from the inner <foreign xml:lang="LAT">penetralia</foreign>
                  came out the young clergyman, followed by one of the firm.</p>
               <p>"Next month, then, Mr. Fields," they heard him say, and the handsome head of the
                  publisher was nodded in assent. The stranger blushed slightly at sight of the two,
                  and then, as they smiled and bowed, said—</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7264-00000070"/>
               <p>"If you are still in the mood for St. Polycarp's, it is near the time." They left
                  the shop together.</p>
               <p>"By the way' said Wise, "how comes it that to-day is Ascension Day? "Was last
                  Sunday Easter?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no," said their new friend; "Easter was more than a month ago."</p>
               <p>"How is that? I'm sure the hymn says— <q>

               <p>"I say, Bryan, how that refutes Mack's argument, that the Resurrection must have
                  been a myth, because the disciples would be sure to start for home the day after
                  the Sabbath."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and Prank Freeman's commentary thereon, that the Lord's appearances were
                  produced by the odic forces of his body remaining in the tomb."</p>
               <p>"But that is really so, is it? I never thought of the forty days before."</p>
               <p>"Well, gentlemen, does it not prove something else beside the fact of the
                  Resurrection? It seems to me that there was time for pretty definite instruction
                  to the Apostles about the Church they were soon to found. You see, two great
                  stumbling-blocks were now removed: the atoning death, the rising from the grave,
                  were two central facts from which the Lord could teach his doctrines and form his
                  institutions."</p>
               <p>"Well; but why, then, have we no account of that period?"</p>
               <p>"I think we have, only one must know what to look for. The Evangelists did not
                  write gossip about their Master, only central and germinal truths. There is enough
                  there, but unless you have the eye that sees and the ear that hears, there is
                  nothing."</p>
               <p>"Very true," said Maurice. "I remember a fellow who walked through the Vatican
                  Gallery in a quarter of an hour, and then said, 'Hang this; let's go and have a
                  cigar outside.' The Apollo and the Laocoon were thrown away on him, to be
                  sure."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the other, "all the wonders of the earth are hidden to the eye of the
                  Australian savage. Study then the history of the great forty days, my breth——" The
                  young divine had got upon one of his sermons, but suddenly catching himself,
                  stammered, blushed, and ended rather abruptly,—"That is, of I—I fancy, gentlemen,
                  that you'll find it pay; and as we're here at St. Polycarp's you'll excuse me if I
                  go to the vestry. Take any seat you like; the seats are all free." So saying, he
                  disappeared up an alley way running to the rear of the church.</p>
               <p>This famous Boston church was not at that time an imposing edifice either without
                  or within. The flat ceiling, the heavy lumbering galleries, were incongruously
                  enough mated with the beautiful stone altar and broad gilt cross over it; its
                  canopied font and its double range of stalls. Yet its very mixture of Anglicanism
                  and New England suited Maurice, perhaps, better than the most elaborates of
                  mediaeval restorations, which he could hardly then appreciate. It seemed to him
                  very nearly what he was hoping to accomplish. There was a large vase of natural
                  flowers upon the altar, and the font was ruddy with scarlet blossoms, topped with
                  a floral cross. The silver vessels were upon the altar and on the credence-table,
                  the vases of the paten and flagon showing underneath the white cloth. The
                  congregation was quite respectable in numbers. Maurice saw more than one familiar
                  face among them of country divines, who had come up to the metropolis, and who,
                  like himself, had "dropped in" for a bit of Oxford scarlet, which, to them, was
                  quite as fascinating, and by no means so perilous to good standing, as the true
                  purple of Rome. A procession of surpliced priests and of choristers swept in from
                  the vestry and took their places in the stalls, among them their new acquaintance.
                  But whose was that tall and stately form which appeared at the opposite end of the
                  altar from the Rector? Surely that face was familiar to Maurice. And doubt changed
                  to certainty when the clergyman took his place a the simple lectern, and in those
                  impressive tones never to be forgotten when once heard announced his text, and
                  began to speak of the great event of the day's commemoration. Maurice felt his
                  cheek burn and his heart beat quicker as he recognized GARDINER. The subject of
                  the sermon was the necessity of the Ascension to the perfecting<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000071"/> fecting of the mediatorial scheme, the continual
                  presence of the Intercessor at the right hand of the Father, His representation on
                  earth through His Vicar, the Holy Ghost, and the means by which that real though
                  spiritual presence was attainable in the Holy Communion. It did not seem like an
                  argument so much as an exposition of well-known facts. Each graceful gesture, each
                  thrilling tone, was full of that personal power which forces conviction. One
                  seemed to be listening to familiar truths spoken: with that intense conviction
                  which leaves no room for doubt or denial. The; wonderful clearness of the whole
                  was like the bursting of pure white light into a dark chamber. Maurice saw the old
                  gray-headed lawyer and judge who sate before him—one well known to the highest
                  records of the judiciary of the Commonwealth—nod his head involuntarily from time
                  to time with that air which only the Bench can show when in a hard-fought case the
                  decisive point of evidence is forced from a reluctant witness, or brought into
                  clear relief by the skilful statement of an accomplished counsel. To their
                  surprise no pause followed the close of the morning service, but the Rector
                  proceeded at once with the Communion Office. One or two near the door stole softly
                  out, but the rest remained; and Maurice, for the second time in his life, found
                  himself spectator of the Anglican, or rather American, order of celebrating the
                  Sacrament. He did not, of course, go up to tile altar, though one or two of the
                  Unitarian ministers did. But he was deeply impressed by the service, especially at
                  the Trisagion, when a boy's clear, birdlike voice took up the first part alone,
                  and the silvery recitative was followed by a burst of choral harmony chanting the <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Scarcely less was he moved by the hearty gladsomeness of the concluding "<foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">Gloria in Excelsis.</foreign>" He lingered outside the church in
                  hopes to meet Gardiner, but the clergy passed out by another way, and he waited in
                  vain.</p>
               <p>"Well, Saltonstall, what do you think of it?" he said at last, as they were on
                  their way back to the Revere, seeing that Wise was disinclined to speak.</p>
               <p>"I don't know, Maurice. I feel as if I had been in another country. I am afraid
                     <emph>we</emph> can never make that do. Our Cambridge impressiveness wouldn't
                  somehow suit that, it is all so different, and then the people seem to know
                  exactly where to come into their places. You never could get New-Englanders into
                  such elaborate simplicity without showing awkwardness." Wise spoke from a favorite
                  theory of his, that Episcopalians in Boston were a sort of colony from other
                  regions—foreigners, English, or Middle States men. "You know," he went on, "we
                  drilled for three weeks to get up our Christmas-eve service in the church at
                  Cambridge, and yet it was a dismal failure."</p>
               <p>"I suspect, old fellow, the secret is that they believe it all."</p>
               <p>"Suppose they do, how is one to get the believing? I shall never try for that,
                  unless—unless, as I sometimes begin to think, I get to do a bit of believing
                  myself."</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> shall try," said Maurice. "I think it can be done. Our people have
                  never had a fair chance."</p>
               <p>"Well, I hope you may succeed; for my part"—and here Wise fell into a reverie, and
                  would say no more, except once he abruptly broke out—"I don't come into town again
                     <emph>this</emph> term. 'Stick as you be' is a good motto till a better turns
                  up. Who was it who preached?. <emph>That</emph> man is no fool, whatever the
                  Episcopal clergy generally may be."</p>
               <p>When the summer vacation came, Wise and Maurice went off on a long projected trip
                  to the White Mountains, and getting lodgings at a farm-house under the shadow of
                  Chocorua, spent their six weeks in foot-rambles, trouting, and sketching in that
                  glorious region. Perhaps it may be thought that our seeker for the truth is
                  falling away from the progress of his earlier days, already chronicled. But human
                  life, except now and then, will not move dramatically, and progress is often in
                  strange zigzags, and by fitful starts. Maurice was passing from the period of mere
                  impressibleness to that of reflection. The past had buried its seeds in, the
                  earth, but they were not dead. His morbidness was disappearing; a healthier and
                  purer tone was coming to his mind. Moreover, he was now learning something of
                  New-England life, and getting to master that <foreign xml:lang="LAT">pons
                     asinorum</foreign> of the "Brahmin caste"—how to talk intelligently to the
                  people. So when he returned to his last year of Cambridge life, it was with an
                  invigorated frame and a soul freed from the shadows of his homeward. voyage. This
                  had never till then been<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7264-00000072"/> the case with
                  him. His solitary hours were profoundly melancholy, or else feverishly busy, and
                  in fact had been one long struggle to escape from his own thoughts. This has not
                  before been mentioned, but it might be inferred from his restless seeking of
                  religious variety, his temporary and desultory raids into various branches of
                  study, which were all so many forms of exorcism against the spectres. He had never
                  come into his life's work so healthily as after this summer ramble. Even the
                  Doctor—for the Rev. Turinell Hooper was now D. D., from the recent Commencement of
                  his Alma Mater—recognized the change, and said, "How well you look, my boy. I
                  think, instead of Nahant, I must try the Mountains next year." So Bryan set
                  himself down to severer study, mainly that of Hebrew and its cognates, and, by way
                  of recreation, to read St. Augustine. Wise laughed, lounged, and by fits and
                  starts studied with him, but they were now much apart from their fellow-students.
                  With the three of their own class they had no sympathy, and the new men, mostly
                  steady, plain, and plodding young men, did not come within what in Cambridge
                  parlance they called their sphere. When the winter vacation commenced, Wise went
                  off for Washington, leaving Maurice the sole tenant of the Divinity Hall, except
                  only one Middler, who was eking out his scanty income by teaching the little girls
                  of a naval officer whose family were resident in Cambridge.</p>
               <p>It was a cold winter morning when Maurice returned to his comfortable study after
                  a brisk walk to the post-office. He had obtained one letter only, which was from
                  Wise:—</p>

                           <p>"MY DEAR ELECTOR OF SAXONY:—I must pitch right into my subject or I
                              shall never have nerve enough for it. I have turned traitor to you; I
                              am not coming back to the school. I did not tell you even last term
                              how wretchedly I felt about it, because I did-not know myself. I said
                              to myself, it is only this miserable January thaw which always upsets
                              me; but it was no such thing. The fact is, I cannot and will not enter
                              the ministry all in a mist of doubt. I have talked with every minister
                              I can find, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Catholic
                              Priests, and they all have their sure grounds, as they think, to go
                              on. I met our young friend, the dearly beloved brother of St.
                              Polycarp's, the other day, and had a long talk with him. He is not a
                              strong-minded person, but he seemed to feel just as sure that
                              something was given him in orders which made him fit to teach others,
                              as I am sure that I am not fit. Now, what sort of grace would be given
                              in the laying on of hands (which I don't know whether they do or not)
                              of Dr. Hooper, who believes the miracles, and the Rev. Eleazar
                              Skinner, who holds that our Lord was a myth representing the progress
                              of free thought? So I have written to the Faculty to take my name off
                              and have accepted the post of private secretary to the Hon. D—— D——,
                              who is going out minister to the court of ——. I am going to try
                              diplomacy till I can get clear beliefs about something. Now, my dear
                              old fellow, forgive me; I am serving you shabbily, but I
                                 <emph>dare</emph> not go on any further. You'll be all right; I
                              have seen you working clear, and when you get a church in Boston I
                              will come and be a pillar unto you.</p>

                              I have sent Dr. H. the wildest sort of an epistle which he will come

               <p>"There, Maurice," said the Doctor, as Bryan looked up amused, "was there ever such
                  a fellow? It upsets my plans too. I was going to have you as my colleague next
                  year, and the General Secretary had promised to send Wise to Connecticut where is
                  a great opening among the Universalists, and now you must go."</p>
               <p>"What! at once?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, when you are licensed from here. There are two places: one at Broadwater,
                  in the centre of the State, and the other at Norowam, nearer New York. But, dear
                  me, how ever shall we get off the rest of the lumber here? The best fellow of the
                  last five years gone, for he has more leadership, more dash, in him than you,—I
                  don't know though that your steadiness is not worth more. Well, you must turn to
                  writing sermons. You'll want a dozen to start with, and when you've visited
                  everybody, you can buckle down to serious work, two a week. If you have six weeks'
                  clear start, and write one a week in that time, that takes you nearly through ten
                  weeks. Here I've marked down a lot of texts as I came out in the 'bus,—go at them
                  in their order and bring your sermons to me to look over."</p>
               <p>And thus was Maurice commissioned for the ministry. The good Doctor bustled off
                  and left Maurice in a deep study over his first homily.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>MAURICE succeeded better with his sermons than he expected, and yet not so well.
                  He was a good writer, he had something of a religious experience to draw upon, and
                  then he was working his way into something of the life of the New Testament
                  period. Here he cut loose from his Unitarian bonds, for he found he must.
                  Questions arose before him of no little interest and difficulty: the astounding
                  apathy of the Hebrew mind toward our Lord's miracles,—at least as compared with
                  our own impressions; the strange seething of the Hebrew social state, with its
                  ineffectiveness of actual result; the true conception of the characters of Pilate,
                  Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and other subordinate actors in that stupendous
                  drama, so different from the ordinary pictures of them; into all these he threw
                  himself with great ardor. A little training from his friend, the Doctor, gave him
                  the needful command of the phraseology of the pulpit. The professor of pulpit
                  eloquence, a gentleman of fine and scholarly tastes and great geniality, was
                  delighted. It was a renewal of the palmy days of the Unitarian fold, when her
                  fiery young crusaders were annually astonishing the cultured elect of the
                  metropolis, fie sighed, too, as he thought how, once in the harness, all this
                  vigor and originality might die away, under the weekly strokes of the parochial
                  air-pump. However, he said nought in discouragement, and the young Senior dashed
                  on in his triumphant course.</p>
               <p>This year the Church's sacred seasons were not kept in prayer, but slyly
                  "improved" in sermons. The narrow influences of sectarian training were beginning
                  to be felt; he was obliged to take heed to what he was saying, even to imaginary
                  congregations. He fell in with sundry pamphlets of controversy in which the
                  Episcopalians were sharply attacked tacked; and, as of course the ideal Church of
                  the future, with its broad altar and broad pulpit had no such spots on its (ideal)
                  feasts of charity, he exulted much in the visionary comparison. He missed, also,
                  Saltonstall Wise's genial, saitrical vein. A dry remark of his friend had often
                  brought him to his bearings, when in a flighty mood.</p>
               <p>By this time, no doubt, the reader will have discovered that Bryan Maurice is
                  somewhat romantic, and given to speculative tendencies. He needed the corrective
                  of practical life, and the outward contact of men gild things; he had, moreover,
                  begun his religious life wrongly; there was no external counterpart in it to the
                  inward change of principle and purpose; and he had begun to follow his own will,
                  instead of seeking guidance.</p>
               <p>He received one or two letters from Wise, during his last term. Brief, pithy and
                  droll, but with a minor key of deep sadness underneath, they were,—and withal,
                  extremely puzzling. Just at the close of the term, a rumor reached the seniors of
                  the Divinity School, that their late classmate, the Secretary of the Hon. the
                  Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Monaco, had been received in the bosom of
                  the infallible church." It disturbed, during twenty-four hours, Bryan's work upon
                  his graduating thesis. He felt that whatever Wise might do would be somehow so
                  seriously in earnest, as to reopen many pages of his past life hitherto deemed
                  closed. But he could not trace the rumor, and another letter came from Wise,
                  saying nothing about it, but devoted to gay, operatic criticism. So the matter was
                  dismissed from his thought. Commencement came, and with it the Divinity School
                  exercises; these attract no brilliant audience, but the select gathering of the
                  few who are anxious to see the special performances of the young men who are soon
                  to "wag their pows in their ain poo-'pits."</p>
               <p>Maurice was complimented by a better audience than usual. Several of the "dons,"
                  who are ordinarily content with their place upon the platform on Commencement Day,
                  and their share in the banquet and oratory of the Phi Beta dinner, strayed into
                  the college chapel on the previous Monday. A few of those gifted ladies who
                  watched over the unorthodoxy of the rising divines were there, and a stiller hush
                  and earnest expectation awaited his opening<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000075"/> words. His thesis, or sermon, had one merit at
                  least,—it was brief. It dashed into the midst of its subject with a few, sharp,
                  confident sentences, and then proceeded to unfold the theory of a new Protestant
                  ritualism adapted to the wants of the Unitarian body. He disclaimed utterly the
                  idea that dilutions of the orthodox forms, emasculated creeds and liturgies, were
                  to serve the turn of Unitarians. They were no Lazaruses, to be fed with crumbs
                  from the rich men's tables. "Surely," he said, "the great Arian controversy had
                  not been merely iconoclastic. The work of the scholars of the liberal school
                  should be to revive the. ancient forms under which the victims of state power had
                  worshipped, ere the Athanasian tyranny had banished them from their rightful
                  altars. He made brief work of the barrenness of Congregationalist no-forms, and
                  proclaimed the work of the Church to be the elimination out of the Greek and Roman
                  rituals of the earlier, the pure, and the primitive forms."</p>
               <p>Dr. Hooper was delighted, and all but forgot himself into awakening the applause
                  permissible to secular efforts; but one or two of the graver heads were shaken
                  dubiously over their white neckcloths, and the venerable professor of exegesis
                  dryly remarked to his colleague, "I don't know who is to do this. Brother G—— is
                  too old, and brother Maurice is rather young: and between these the rest of us are
                  too busy. Perhaps somebody in Providence or Salem might try his hand at it."</p>
               <p>Maurice was duly licensed to preach, but not, of course, "ordained," not having
                  any parish. Nevertheless, he was free to fulfil most ministerial offices, and he
                  assumed, without hesitation, the style of "Rev.," and was duly italicized in the
                  coming Triennial. He declined one or two offers of preaching as a candidate in
                  various towns, and went for a quiet vacation to the seaside cottage of Dr. Hooper,
                  preparatory to his departure to the unknown wilds of Connecticut.</p>
               <p>The Doctor refused to let Maurice preach for him during this time, though in the
                  habit of inviting the young licentiates very freely.' "No, Maurice," he said, "I
                  don't want you to do it. I count on you, and cannot let you make a single false
                  step. If you preach before you have your own congregation before you, you will be
                  in danger of acquiring mannerisms that you won't get over for years. When next
                  year, you come tip to Commencement, then I'll have you out, but not now."</p>
               <p>So Maurice remained quiet in his summer resting-place, and, after his hard work,
                  was really braced up by his six weeks' bathing and fishing and boating.</p>
               <p>I am tempted to chronicle some of his talks there, and his letters from Wise; but
                  at that rate, I shall never get him where I want him, and that is into one of the
                  cars on a railroad going out of Providence. It was three o'clock of a sultry
                  afternoon. There were few passengers, and after gazing a few moments at the
                  picturesque appearance of the city, he found nothing more to occupy his attention.
                  He bethought himself of a volume of Emerson in his travelling-bag. He soon wearied
                  of its familiar pages. The calm, contemplative philosophy was as dry husks to a
                  soul on fire for action, and longing for tangible fields of labor. He had no
                  sympathy with its vague Pantheism. He tried daydreaming,—fancies of the country
                  town whither he was bound,—but he was too warm for reverie; the reminiscences of
                  his travels, but there was the painful gulf of his homeward voyage between himself
                  and his past. He looked about for congenial faces, that he might talk, but none
                  appeared.</p>
               <p>At last, however, at a junction, one of his own age and apparent station got in,
                  glanced around, with a pleasant look, and, as Maurice made a motion of giving him
                  room, dropped sociably into the seat beside him.</p>
               <p>It was evident that both young men were of the Brahmin caste of New England life,
                  and so, with a remark about the heat, the thread was caught.</p>
               <p>"I have just come from the seaside," the stranger said, "and I feel this inland
                  heat. I was officiating yesterday at Stonington, and was cool enough; I had to ask
                  the sexton, when he came into the vestry, to go round and close the chancel
                  window."</p>
               <p>"You are an Episcopal clergyman, then?" said Maurice, catching at the terms used;
                  "you are just the one I wanted to meet. I, too, am a minister, though a very
                  untried one."</p>
               <p>"Not a Church clergyman?"</p>
               <p>"No—yes—of the Broad Church. I have sometimes fancied yours to be the Narrow
                  Branch. I—I am a Unitarian. But we must not begin our acquaintance with
                     discussion<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7264-00000076"/> cussion; I have met with
                  more courtesy from your denomination than from the other orthodox sects. One thing
                  I like <emph>much:</emph> you do not refuse us clerical fellowship on the ground
                  of formulas you cannot explain and never use. If I understand rightly, you put us
                  in. the same boat with the strictest Calvinists, as being unordained. If you are
                  right, of course you act properly, and we are wrong. I like, too, your service;
                  you, never are given to uncharitable prayers <emph>at</emph> people. In fact, I
                  hope to use your liturgy,—in some parts at least, and that is what I want to talk
                  about. You won't object, I dare say?'"</p>
               <p>"Oh, by no means; but, pardon me, how will you manage it; I, too, have something
                  to learn from you? Our service is founded on the faith that Jesus Christ is the
                  Son of God,—God the Son,—and the Trinity is the corner-stone of the Prayer-Book.
                  Pull out that and you will have the house down."</p>
               <p>"No," said Maurice; "I think not. You of course know more about your Book than I
                  do; but I have studied it a good deal, and it seems to me that changing a few, a
                  very few phrases, we can get along. We admit,—or at least I admit," he continued,
                  as a remembrance of the Divinity School came over him—"that Jesus Christ was the
                  Son of God; but I do not go with, you beyond Scripture, and say also God the Son.
                  If I understand the Arian fathers I am with them, and, indeed I think I shall use
                  the creed of St. Arius. It is only to say '<hi rend="i"/>of like substance,' and I
                  am where I hold the whole Primitive Church to have been. But I think your plea for
                  Orders may be good, and if I could meet with a Bishop of my own views, I would go
                  to hint and receive them at his hands."</p>
               <p>The young divine had looked rather bewildered as this declaration went on. He had
                  begun to rub up his seminary weapons; but the foe had suddenly shifted ground,—not
                  out of range, but at the very muzzles of his guns.</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," he said, "you can't find such a Bishop, for the best of reasons.
                  The Church departing from the faith loses the gift of Orders,—practically in
                  history, I mean,—just as the Church abandoning the Succession will come to lose
                  the faith. The Arian Bishops could not keep up the Succession."</p>
               <p>"There always was something mysterious and unaccountable able to me in the
                  sub-Nicene period," said Maurice; "however, I can fall back upon my Congregational
                  liberty of conscience and do without Orders, especially as I do hold that each
                  Body has a right to frame its own belief," he added, a little inconsistently.</p>
               <p>"What becomes then of this—'I believe one Catholic and Apostolic Church'? Do you
                  mean to keep that?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I mean by that, I suppose, to express my belief in the Church that existed
                  previous to the imposition of terms of restraint which forbid our unity with
                  it."</p>
               <p>"But does not that Church—I mean historically as a fact—exist still? You and I
                  both insist that the Church of Rome is in this position,—the imposer of unlawful
                  conditions; but we can't say there is no Church of Rome."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but I hold that the Church, as a spiritual body, is in abeyance till the
                  time when the faith is restored," said Maurice, who felt himself going to the
                  wall.</p>
               <p>"What you believe in is, then, a sepulchre, from which Christ has arisen. You must
                  change your Article to this,—'I believe there used to be a Catholic and Apostolic
                  Church, but Christ failed of his promise to be with it always.' How with the next
                  Article,—'One baptism for the remission of sins?' There being no Church, what is
                  there to baptize into? And who is there to baptize you?"</p>
               <p>"Really, I have never come so far as that," said Maurice; "but I thought of
                  omitting that Article altogether, because of another reason. I—I—you must think me
                  rather a strange being—never was baptized."</p>
               <p>"And yet you propose to act as by a commission to baptize others,—that is, to
                  confer the membership of a Church which does not exist, and of which, if it did,
                  you are not a member."</p>
               <p>"Why, it does seem so," said Maurice, choking down a little inward vexation. "But
                  I never thought of baptism in that light."</p>
               <p>"Pray in what light did you think of it?" It was not an easy question to
                  answer.</p>
               <p>"I suppose as a ceremony, or giving the name to a child; a religious rite,
                  recognizing that all souls belong to God, our Father; not a necessary rite, but a
                  desirable one. If we say 'Our Father He will hear us without the formula of the
                  minister."</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7264-00000077"/>
               <p>"Has He said so? Has He not said quite the contrary?"</p>
               <p>Maurice quoted the stock text: "Neither in this mountain, nor yet in Jerusalem,
                  &amp;c.; God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and
                  in truth."</p>
               <p>"I suppose your spiritual and truthful intent to go to New York to-day would not
                  take you there without the form of stepping into the Cars."</p>
               <p>Maurice was almost angry at this close following up; but natural frankness
                  conquered.</p>
               <p>"Well, you may be right, theoretically; but how can I, with my doubts and all
                  that, submit to it; and if I could, who is to do it?"</p>
               <p>"You cannot, and you ought not. If you believe with the Jew and the Heathen, the
                  Church of Christ is no place for you."</p>
               <p>Maurice flushed. "You think, then, that I am lost eternally, and of course this
                  could not be, unless God from eternity meant I should be?"</p>
               <p>"Who told you I thought any such thing? certainly nothing in my words told you so.
                     <emph>I</emph> think you are not far from the kingdom. You seem to me to be
                  honest and sincere, and in real earnest about these matters. I have talked with
                  many a Unitarian before this, but never with one like you Not that they are not
                  honest and sincere and all that; I don't mean in that way, but in the turn of your
                  thought. All that you need is to be logical. I think you want the truth, and the
                  truth wants you," said the young priest, holding out his hand, which Maurice
                  took.</p>
               <p>"Look here, Mister," broke in a rough-looking man who had taken the seat before
                  them, and had evidently been listening to their conversation,—"look here, Mister.
                  I waant to know if you hold that a man's agoin' to hell, because he don't swaller
                  all you parsons preach? I don't believe there is any hell. It is all for
                  frightenin' folks into your meetin'-houses where you can get money out of 'em. I'm
                  a liberal man, I am, and don't hold to no 'mersion, sprinklin', nor nothin' of the
                  sort. If a man does as he oughter, and votes the free-bill ticket, and don't drink
                  no rum, he's about right for this world and the next too."</p>
               <p>"But suppose he does drink rum, and votes the wrong ticket, and is as bad a man as
                  he can be," said Maurice, who was heartily disgusted at the proposed new alliance,
                  "what do you say then?"</p>
               <p>"There wouldn't be no such fellows if you ministers did your duty," said the
                  man.</p>
               <p>"How shall we do it so as to help such things?" said Maurice.</p>
               <p>"Preach against 'em. Don't preach brimstone."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but how about the men who won't hear us—who never come into a church? Even
                  the Saviour found plenty who would not listen to him. What is to be for them?"</p>
               <p>"Look here, I don't believe in no hell, any way you can fix it; but when a man
                  sells his children into slavery, there is something ought to be done about
                  it—that's a fact."</p>
               <p>"Well, my friend, if you think the Creator left out of His plans something
                  essential, I am afraid we cannot mend the matter," said the clergyman; "but
                  meanwhile, if you will do what you believe to be right, and do nothing you think
                  to be wrong, perhaps you may get some light upon the subject."</p>
               <p>Maurice rather liked this practical way of winding up a controversy which further
                  came to an end by the stopping of the cars at a station, where the anti-brimstone
                  man got out. Another clergyman got in, a stout, elderly man, with sharp, keen
                  eyes, and a brisk but genial voice. He greeted his young brother warmly, and then
                  said—"Come and sit by me. I want to talk to you about that new Canon. The Bishop
                  thinks I'm wrong, and I think that he has a notion that we want to tie up the
                  laity too closely."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me a little while," said the young priest to Maurice. "The Doctor wants
                  me, I see; but we'll meet again. Your ticket, I see, is for H——. Shall you go
                  further? If you are bound for New York, I will introduce you to the Doctor, who
                  will go most of the way."</p>
               <p>"No, I am bound for Broadwater."</p>
               <p>"All right. We change cars at H——, and I shall see you again. I go there too." He
                  slipped his card into Maurice's hand, received one in exchange, and took a new
                  seat.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>IT was necessary to change cars before reaching Broad-water. Maurice did not meet
                  his new acquaintance again till they got out, in the little barn-like terminus of
                  the branch railway. Maurice sent on his luggage to the hotel, the Decatur House,
                  and walked up with his companion. The twilight of a summer evening was just
                  throwing its shades over the landscape, but leaving it light enough to see the
                  pleasant little town. They passed by the side of a large brown-stone church, with
                  'Gothic windows and heavy buttresses, a tower capped with a temporary wooden roof,
                  and a wheel-cross upon its western gable, which Maurice supposed to be the
                  Episcopal Church; and then they found themselves in a broad, still street, lined
                  with elms and bordered by shrubberies. A brief walk brought them into the centre
                  of the town, in front of a large three-story-house of stately proportions,
                  standing on a corner. A light balcony ran along its front. Just above this, in the
                  second story, the central window was brightly lit up. As they crossed the street,
                  a group of two or three young men, carrying oars and other boat gear, preceded
                  them and entered a side door of the dwelling. Upon the panes of the lighted window
                  Maurice caught a glimpse of something like the shadow of a cross. There came from
                  the room a burst of chanting—the words of a Psalm—the same which Maurice had heard
                  in St. Polycarp's. "The boys must be practicing to-night," said his companion; "it
                  is long past chapel time."</p>
               <p>"What is it?" asked Maurice, in wonder.</p>
               <p>"Oh! it is our little chapel in the Cranmer School. If you have time, I'll take
                  you there to-morrow. This, you know, is the Bishop's house. The Decatur Hotel is
                  not far beyond."</p>
               <p>Maurice had no further opportunity for conversation that evening. He had to
                  provide for his own creature comfort, and then to sally out in search of the
                  gentleman upon whose invitation he had come to Broadwater. He inquired, while at
                  tea, the direction by which to find the house of Mr. Conway, and then set out in
                  the gloom of an almost ended twilight to seek it. His way led up the hill which
                  rises behind the Main Street of Broadwater, and thence along a deeply shaded
                  avenue, with its yellowing leaves already fallen here and there upon the walk. He
                  soon reached the house described to him,—a large, gloomy stone house, which, in
                  the starlight, appeared unusually forbidding. The feeling of uneasiness with which
                  he recognized it was not lessened when he entered a vestibule scarcely less
                  repellant; and, after sending up his name by the domestic, who opened the door,
                  was shown into a chill and dimly lighted parlor.</p>
               <p>He was kept waiting some minutes ere Mr. Conway entered. The tall, thin, elderly
                  gentleman who at last appeared was in entire keeping with the house.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Maurice?" he said, inquiringly: "I'm sorry to keep you waiting, sir," he
                  continued, upon Maurice's affirmative bow; "but I've not very pleasant news to
                  tell you. In fact, if I could have written in time, you might have been saved your
                  journey. The society have decided to retain Benson another year. He has come out
                  on the Fremont ticket without reserve; and, besides that, to tell you the truth
                  frankly, there is something about the name 'Unitarian' which goes hardly here.
                     <emph>I</emph> should be glad to see an out-and-out Parkerite here, but some of
                  our richest pew-holders cling to the name of Universalist. Between you and me,
                  Benson is a regular stick in the pulpit; but he's a capital hand at
                  electioneering, and will take as strong a stand as we could wish against the
                  Episcopalians. And—and—frankly, I must say, Mr. Maurice, that—that—we've been
                  written to, from Boston, that you are not quite 'sound upon the goose' in that
                  particular: our people are very jealous of that. You might better be half a
                  Catholic than having anything to do with those proud, exclusive folks. You've been
                  at some expense; I suppose we ought to make that right,—say ten dollars: and, if
                  you'll stop over Sunday, and preach for us, we'll be glad to hear you, and it
                  won't stand in your way in case Benson goes next year." Maurice<pb n="156-157"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000079"/> rice was a good deal chilled and disheartened. He
                  politely declined the offered bill, which was put back into the owner's pocket
                  with the accompaniment of a very faint protest and an audible sigh of relief; and
                  then, after also declining all propositions of hospitality, returned to the
                  Hotel.</p>
               <p>He found, that, by going on to New York, he could, from there, easily reach the
                  other alternative point of his journey, the society of Universalists or Unitarians
                  in the little town of Norowam. So, after a vain attempt to "take his ease in his
                  inn," in the perusal of a three-days-old "New York Herald" in a badly lighted
                  hall, he went to bed. The next morning he met, at the breakfast-table, his young
                  clerical, friend. As they rose from their meal, the latter said, "Come, go with me
                  to chapel." Maurice was quite ready to go anywhere; so they started up the wide
                  pleasant street, past old-fashioned houses set well back from the grass-grown
                  sidewalk, or bowered in trees, until they reached the three-story mansion he had
                  passed the night before. They entered at the side-door, and ascended a lofty and
                  winding staircase. The whole had that indescribable air which is only found in
                  houses belonging to that earlier period when there were in the land distinctions
                  between gentle and simple. It is something quite other than that pretentiousness
                  with which the successful vender of a quack balsam lavishes all the incongruities
                  of architecture upon his fine new palace. We cannot describe it; but it is a
                  certain sense of breadth and spaciousness and proportion which marks the style of
                  an old family. They passed into a large vestibule. Two folding-doors stood open
                  into a smaller room. At its eastern end, and against the window, the panes of
                  which were "frosted" so as to exclude all view of the street, stood a small altar,
                  covered by a crimson altar-cloth with a plain embroidered monogram in the centre.
                  A screen, colored in ultramarine and topped with a cross, was behind it for a
                  reredos. A simple bench ran along the wall on either side. Texts of Scripture were
                  emblazoned on the walls. At the lower end was placed a lectern of carved wood,
                  facing the east, upon which was Laid a huge folio Bible. A young man stood there,
                  finding the place of the daily lesson. Maurice had no time to examine more; for
                  his friend, signing to him to follow, knelt down at one of the benches: and
                  Maurice did the same. When he rose, the little chapel had begun to fill. Fourteen
                  or fifteen young men, mostly wearing simple black stuff gowns, like the
                  undergraduates' gowns in an English University, were either kneeling at their
                  places, or else had resumed their seats and were finding the manuscript music of
                  the chants for the day. A surpliced clergyman entered from an inner room, in what
                  seemed to Maurice rather a quick and business-like way; not irreverent, indeed,
                  but the reverse of pompous. He knelt at the altar in private prayer; and then, as
                  he rose, all rose with him. He broke the silence by neither sentence nor
                  exhortation, but by the simple versicle, "O God! make speed to save us." All
                  answered, "O Lord! make haste to help us;" and then, kneeling, every voice united
                  in the Confession. The Absolution and Lord's Prayer followed. The former seemed to
                  Maurice as if spoken directly to him. Hitherto he had been far away from the
                  officiating priest, and, as it were, a spectator; now it was uttered above the
                  head of him kneeling there, and he felt that it belonged to him also. He had never
                  come quite so close to it, except by Frank's death-bed; and then he had felt
                  himself to be outside of the whole service. There was no "Venite," but the Priest
                  announced the Psalter for the day; and then all the voices upon his side joined
                  with him in repeating the first verse of the Psalm, while the response was made in
                  the same manner by those opposite. It took Maurice entirely by surprise,
                  accustomed as he had been to hear only whispered or muttered responses in most of
                  the Episcopal Churches he had visited in Boston. The sustained heartiness was
                  singularly fresh and real to him. What he had fancied of ancient Hebrew worship
                  seemed to be revived there. At the close of the Psalter came a rapid burst of
                  choral harmony in the "Gloria Patri." He contrasted involuntarily, in his thought,
                  the languidness and baldness of the chapel service at Cambridge. Then one of the
                  young men stepped quietly to the lectern, and read a lesson from the Old
                  Testament. It was not over well done, certainly with none of that studied
                  effectiveness which he was wont to hear in the reading of Scripture, but simply
                  with rather a school-boy manner; yet, in one or two places, Maurice was struck by
                  a justness of emphasis which gave a new force to passages commonly slurred over.
                  Scarcely had the reader said, "Here<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7264-00000080"/>
                  endeth the lesson," when the students' voices joined once more in the
                  "Magnificat." The music thrilled Maurice with a strange delight. It was not
                  operatic, it was not the display of a hired quartette, nor did it have the
                  drawling monotony of the Gregorians, which he had heard so often at St. Peter's,
                  at Rome; but it carried him along upon its wings. The young man next whom he stood
                  put into his hands a little printed leaf containing the words properly pointed for
                  chanting; and Maurice found himself compelled to join in the tide of holy song,
                  and to repeat "My spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour." The canticle came to a
                  close with the inevitable "Gloria," which Maurice had halfway finished before he
                  was aware of it; and then came the Creed. Maurice had begun to join in it,
                  expecting the familiar Apostles' Creed, which Unitarians contrive to accept under
                  their own limitations. It was, however, the Nicene Symbol. Yet he could not pause
                  to weigh its expressions; there was no time for it; and so, being familiar with
                  its phrases, since he had been studying them of late, he continued on. When every
                  head was bowed at the name of the Adorable Son, his, too, was bent in instinctive
                  yielding to the spirit of the place. The faith of the spot "constrained him."</p>
               <p>Faith had begun to dawn: Hope was yet afar off; but in her coming was to come the
                  greatest of these, as yet not seen save through a glass darkly. And now, with a
                  gesture of benediction, the priest turned from facing the little altar toward the
                  little congregation, saying, "The Lord be with you." Maurice could not but join in
                  the response, "And with thy spirit;" for his attention was strongly caught by the
                  aspect of the clergyman whom he saw. The face was that of a man in the earlier
                  years of middle life—a square, slightly massive head, the expression deeply
                  earnest, the stature of middle height; the whole man betraying in his
                  restlessness, his careless <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pose</foreign> and quick
                  intuition, as well as by the tones of the rich and flexible voice, an unusual
                  amount of energy and restrained power. All knelt, however, before Maurice could do
                  more than take in at a single glance that which has been above described. The
                  service continued in a series of brief petitions and responses, unfamiliar to
                  Maurice, but evidently the daily usage of the others. He was sure, also, that the
                  collects which followed were not in the Prayer-book. Now especially struck his
                  fancy. It was not a Litany day, but these two exquisite supplications, one for
                  rulers and the other for unity, seemed to him in the very spirit of the
                  Prayer-book. The latter, most of all, met his mood—"Give us grace seriously to lay
                  to heart the great danger the Church is in by our unhappy divisions; that, as
                  there is one body and one spirit, even as we are called in one hope of our
                  calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of us all; so may we
                  be joined together in one holy bond of peace and love." It seemed to him as if a
                  tender mother had known his perplexities, and were praying for him. When he rose
                  from his knees, the students were passing out. One or two staid to chat; the
                  priest came out of an adjoining room unvested, and greeted Maurice's friend
                  warmly. "So you've come back to see how we're getting on. I'm sorry to say the
                  Bishop is not here. He is expected in the morning train. We're doing nicely this
                  term, I think. By the by, have you seen ——'s book on the Romans? It is not a bad
                  thing—wants scholarship, but it is a move out of the old rut. You keep up your
                  German? How comes on Meyer?" Maurice thought him an Englishman; there was some
                  very English in his hearty, emphatic manner and clear enunciation. His friend had
                  made a movement as if to introduce Maurice to the Professor, when one of the
                  students interrupted. "Professor, do we meet you at ten or eleven?" And Maurice,
                  feeling a little in the way, stepped toward the door. Something was said in an
                  undertone, and then his companion rejoined him. "Shall we walk this morning?" he
                  said. "Excuse me for not presenting you to our Professor; but he will be engaged,
                  I find, with his recitations; and you, I think, leave this afternoon. This way, if
                  you will." So he led Maurice up the beautiful street which leads from the Divinity
                  School to the hill-top. After a moment of silence, the clergyman asked, "How do
                  you like our service?"—"Oh, I was very much taken with it," said Maurice; "but
                  where do you get it? for instance, that canticle, 'My soul doth magnify the
                  Lord'?"—"Oh, that is the Magnificat,' the song of the Blessed Virgin."—"Ah, yes, I
                  see," said Maurice; "a Catholic hymn translated into English—by whom? Where can
                  one find that?"—"A certain St. Luke, who was St. Paul's friend, and, some think,
                  disciple, gave<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7264-00000081"/> it to the Catholic
                  Church. St. Mary first uttered it. He recorded it, but who translated it I cannot
                  tell you—one of the translators of the English Prayer-book and Bible. You will
                  find it in the first chapter of St. Luke's Gospel." "What, a Gospel of the early
                  times?" said Maurice; and then, catching the amused look on his companion's face,
                  he said, "You don't mean that is in the Bible?"—"Look and see' said the other.
                  Maurice colored up to the eyes, and then said, abruptly, "How can you so depart
                  from your Prayer-book? I thought you were tied to that."—"You forget that Bishops
                  have power to arrange services in their own schools as they like."—"Very well, I
                  will be a Bishop, and have my own Cathedral to myself."—"Pardon me; but I fear you
                  will have it <emph>all</emph> to yourself, if you try it upon our Connecticut
                  Universalists. However, don't let me discourage you; it is all working for us. It
                  will help to put <emph>you</emph> right, if it does nobody else; and I think I
                  should call that a great gain."—"You don't object, then, to my using the
                  Prayer-book?"—"Certainly not: use it all you can; only you will find, probably,
                  some difficulties. <emph>Making</emph> a service is not done in a day; ours
                  grew."</p>
               <p>Maurice found himself with many new facts over which he could not help pondering.
                  How was it that the Church seemed so confident of her pedigree, so fearless in her
                  steps, and yet so meek and lowly in the outward display and temper? Another thing
                  was impressed upon him very forcibly. Throughout this service was kept that proper
                  gradation between priest and people, which marks a Church which
                     <emph>believes</emph> in a duly commissioned ministry,—kept as fully as in a
                  public congregation. When, in his divinity studies, it had come to the lot of the
                  senior class to conduct their services, each member had in turn to stand the fire
                  of hostile, sometimes of envenomed, criticism. He himself remembered prayers
                  uttered in bitterness of spirit, conscious that he was next to be pulled to
                  pieces. But here was kept the unchanged memory of the Church's high descent from
                  Patriarchal and Levitic hierarchies, where none might usurp the priesthood. Though
                  the family were one in blood, the first-born alone stood to minister.</p>
               <p>They had reached the upper street of the town, and had walked on in silence a
                  little while, when Maurice stopped suddenly, exclaiming, "How beautiful!" It was
                  indeed worthy of a pause. Through an opening in the foliage, there was given to
                  view the wide landscape. Below them lay the town, embosomed in its leafage, while
                  afar stretched the green hill-sides, dipping here and there into purple hollows of
                  shadow. In the midst lay a fair reach of river, set like a sapphire in the steep
                  surrounding shores. It was disclosed at that precise angle from which it appeared
                  less like a river than like a tranquil lake. One white sail, swiftly skimming up
                  from the unseen outlet of the gorge below, was in view. Then came another and
                  another, like a flight of swans, graceful and gliding. The college-green was
                  beside them: the buildings were of that heavy, four-storied factory pattern which
                  it seems essential to bestow upon all American college edifices, but with such a
                  lawn and such elms as Oxford might be proud of. "And this was your home," said
                  Maurice: "I wish it had been mine." "Perhaps it may yet be,—who knows? you are
                  young," said the other, "young enough to turn from the experiment, if it fail of
                  renewing a Catholic Christianity under Arian auspices. But shall we return now? I
                  must see the Bishop when he arrives. I would take you up to see him,—I have a
                  fancy he would do you lots of good,—but the Trustees are to meet, I believe, and I
                  shall not see more of him than I have absolute need to do. I will take you to our
                  little library, and I dare say you can be comfortable there." Maurice found the
                  change to the cool, still room, very pleasant, from the heated air without. In the
                  alcoves, scenting slightly of dust, of Russia leather, and that indefinable
                  bookish odor so dear to reading men, Maurice whiled away the morning. He got down
                  a splendid vellum-bound copy of the first Prayer-book of King Edward VI., and was
                  surprised to find therein much of the morning's chapel service. At first, his
                  feeling was of exultation, as he said to himself, "These Churchmen, as they call
                  themselves, cannot <emph>make</emph> any thing,—only inherit;" and then it
                  occurred to him how infinitely more precious was the simplest jewel worn as a
                  family heir-loom than the parvenu's bought diamond. "Nevertheless, we are the true
                  heirs of all this," he thought; and then he found himself a little in doubt as to
                  who "we" might be. So he went about, dipping into various other books,—a copy of
                  the "Chapel Liturgy" of the Boston Society; and also an Irvingite<pb n="162-163"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000082"/> Manual, which bewildered him; and, finally, he
                  settled down into a steady perusal of "Ward's Ideal of a Christian Church," which
                  both fascinated and puzzled him. "What I want," said he, "is not the ideal, but
                  the reality."</p>
               <p>Just then the door opened, and two gentlemen entered. Neither of them saw Maurice
                  as he sat sheltered in his alcove. "Ah! here is what we want," said one of them,
                  "Wilberforce on the Incarnation." "Well, what do you say of him, sir?" "I own he
                  has nearly persuaded me that the Church is not invisible. I am taught here as
                  against the ultra-protestant; therefore, as it is visible, and is Christ's
                  mystical body, why must it not have unity, and therefore one central head? How can
                  separation from that head be other than fatal?"</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," replied the other, "the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">proton
                     pseudos</foreign> of Wilberforce lies in this,—his idea of a body. The Church
                  in itself is visible; but it concerns the sphere of invisible things. Its unity
                  lies in a principle, not in a forced mechanical unity with the Papacy. When the
                  Church was planted by the apostles, it contained germs of faith, worship, order
                  and polity. These grew according to the life that was in them. Liturgies became a
                  necessity, because of the sacraments. Polity was developed from the fact of a
                  ministry. The principle of unity lay in the existence of an Apostolic Episcopacy.
                  Each Bishop was an independent centre, but not an independent church. Where there
                  was a Bishop, there was the, not a, Church,—<foreign xml:lang="LAT">ubi Episcopus
                     ibi Ecclesia;</foreign> its members many, its principle of unity single."
                  "Where then, my dear sir, was its controlling headship? to whom was each Bishop
                  responsible?" "To the Head of the Church Himself." "How was that responsibility
                  enforced?" "By the whole Church acting in accordance with its sense of divine
                  presence. The Papacy is a mechanical invention, which practically denies the
                  divine institution of the Church, because of lack of faith in the apostolic
                  promise, 'Lo! I am with you alway.' So long as the Church is one, schism is simply
                  suicide, self-excommunication."</p>
               <p>"But, Professor," said the other, "why is not that Congregationalism?" "Because
                  Congregationalism holds not to the divine origin, but to the self-origination of
                  the Church on the part of the laity." "Well, Presbyterianism, then." "No: that
                  holds to the power of the ministerial body, not to an organic Church. The one is
                  the lay, the other the ecclesiastical, half-truth, of the real condition of the
                  Church."</p>
               <p>Maurice regarded the two speakers. One was a man of middle life, with curling
                  hair, and his handsome head carried rather haughtily; his voice full and rich,
                  with something in its swelling intonation of that utterance peculiar to Harvard.
                  The other was younger, wore glasses, and had a slight stoop, but was not
                  especially noticeable in other respects. He looked too old to be a student, yet he
                  wore the black gown of the school. Maurice wondered who they were. The Professor
                  continued: "Don't let Wilber-force's brilliant theorizing carry you away. The
                  Church his need of central principles, not of centralizing institutions. Suppose
                  you take this theory of the Archdeacon's, and try to meet it, as your next
                  exercise with me." The student looked pleased, took the book, and presently
                  withdrew, drawing his gown up over his rounded shoulders as he went.</p>
               <p>The Professor caught sight of Maurice, looked at him for a moment, and then went
                  up to him. "Excuse me, sir; but are not you Mr. Maurice of Harvard?" "I am, sir;
                  and you?" "The Rev. Charles Wentworth, at your service, sir. I remember your face
                  quite well. I met you at Dr. Hooper's in Boston. Hooper was a classmate of mine.
                  Are you coming to our Divinity School?" "No, sir. My theological studies are over,
                  at least as far as Divinity Schools are concerned. I am a graduate of the school
                  at Cambridge, and came to Broadwater to preach for the Universalists here; but
                  there is, it seems, no vacancy." "But you are no Universalist?" "No, I can hardly
                  tell what I am. I am looking for a field to find room to plant some notions of my
                  own; and I find here some things which, I must say, attract me very much." He held
                  out "Ward's Ideal" as he spoke. The Professor glanced at it with a half-sigh.
                  "That book has upset many a fine fellow," he said; "but, really, I don't see how
                  to caution you against it. Your eclecticism must be your defence for the present.
                  And yet you are seeking the ideal of a Christian Church." "Yes, sir; and your
                  Church attracts me strangely,—attracts and repels me. I like its clear sense of
                  its own position; but then its assumption to be the one right thing, and
                     everybody<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7264-00000083"/> body else wrong, I am not
                  prepared to give in to. Why cannot men do as they please?" Maurice was singularly
                  constituted in mind. He was for ever on the opposition benches. Among Unitarians
                  he was always insisting upon the divine authority of the Church; while, with every
                  Churchman he met, he was ready to stand up for the principle of the larger liberty
                  of unqualified sectarianism.</p>
               <p>The Professor answered not as he had expected. "Yes: we have indeed a narrow way
                  of putting things,—a great littleness, so to speak, in magnificent trifles. But
                  you will find the germinal ideas of the holy Catholic Church in us; and therefore,
                  when we can throw off this load of rubbish, which the timidity and torpor of many
                  of us have a holy horror of seeing touched, these will begin to grow., But still,
                  as a Unitarian, I do not see what we can do for you. You say you are one?"</p>
               <p>"Yes: that is, I hold that the Church has, in the Nicene Creed, imposed
                  unscriptural terms. I said to my friend who brought 'me here, that I believed
                  Christ to be the Son of God, not God the Son. Perhaps I was wrong in being so
                  positive: I am willing to receive, but not to profess, the latter point. I think
                  it is unlawfully required."</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," said the Professor, his eye kindling and his noble head thrown back
                  as he warmed to controversy,—"my dear sir, in the primitive Church the Creed was
                  given as a germ, first in the profession of St. Peter, 'Thou art the Christ;'
                  then, when it was necessary for the faith to be professed beyond the limits of
                  Messianic teaching, and these words no longer conveyed distinct ideas, it was
                  enlarged into the formula of baptism,—Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. You admit that
                  the apostles were monotheists. They must have taught the Gentiles to believe in
                  one God."—"Of course."—"Yes, of course, monotheism was a necessity; it lay at the
                  very door of a renunciation of the Pagan Creeds; yet the Apostles baptized in the
                  name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Did they, then, teach three Gods?"—"No, I
                  suppose not."—"Very well, then. Here is a germ of a theological position. To the
                  Gentiles they preached the invisible Father, revealed and manifested in the Son,
                  and witnessed to by the Holy Ghost. Here are three personalities surely. Now, when
                  controversy came,—and you must study the Gnostic heresies to understand the
                  bearing of this,—comes also St. John, in the last days of the Apostolic Church,
                  and writes that the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Logos</foreign> (the Gnostic name, you
                  know, for Jesus Christ) was with God in the beginning, and was God.</p>
               <p>"Later on, Arius institutes new denials; and a new definition is required, of
                  course extra-scriptural, since no apostle survived to write a new Scripture. The
                  sense of certain terms had become ambiguous. The Church does not change her faith,
                  because she makes these certain. She only renders explicit that which was implicit
                  before."</p>
               <p>Maurice was silent. He knew not what to answer. "You will come back here," said
                  Wentworth, "some day, I am well assured; and, when you do, you must find me out.
                  My parish is St. Andrew's, in ——. I shall always be glad to see you."</p>
               <p>That same afternoon Maurice returned to Hartford; and then, after a day or two in
                  that pleasant rural city with a college friend, he took the boat for New York.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <p>MAURICE left Hartford, by the New-York boat, upon the Monday afternoon succeeding
                  his fruitless visit to Broadwater. In spite of his reminiscences of European
                  scenery, he was yet delighted with the little-prized but lovely passage of the
                  Lower Connecticut. It brought to mind the Danube, and yet in all unlikeness; for
                  nature never offers the wine of her beauty in twin goblets, but every chalice is
                  wrought with its special device. The steamer—so different from the little toiling
                  European river-craft—swept onward like a floating castle, contemptuous of tide or
                  rapid, cleaving the fair wave and parting the green reflections of the hills, past
                  quiet nooks and winding glens luxuriant with foliage; the light birchen leaves,
                  the bright maple groves, the darker cedar thickets, and bristling oaks, with fair
                  lawnlets of cushioned meadow, lying beneath. White and brown farmsteads, new and
                  old, dotted the hillsides here and there. Brisk and busy landings, often with huge
                  skeletons of building ships beside them, occurred at every few miles; and all this
                  landscape slumbered beneath the warm, hazy sunshine. By and by this began to
                  change,—and into glorious crimson and gold, and rich apple-green, flamed and faded
                  the West. The bell rang for supper, as the boat glided out between the low salt
                  marshes of the river mouth; and, when the night wind began to grow chill, Maurice
                  was ready to leave his mingled dream of memory and fancy, and go below to the
                  substantial matter-of-fact of meal-time. At the long table he found his place
                  between a thin, pale young gentleman in rusty black, and a heavy, robust man of
                  middle life, who, he felt, might be a country schoolmaster, a lawyer of local fame
                  and limited autocracy, or a prosperous shopkeeper of an inland town. After the
                  business of refection had been silently and studiously (not to say swiftly)
                  transacted, a disposition for talk became manifest. That is, men turned from
                  sausages, Indian-meal bread, and oysters, inquiring glances toward each other's
                  faces. When the clerk, and the attendant gray-haired negro who occupied the
                  important post of head-waiter, had, with a large roll of dollar bills stuck
                  between their fore and middle fingers, circled the table to the low refrain of
                  "Tickets, gentlemen; supper tickets, if you please," the desire to converse began
                  to blossom out into meteorological and wayfaring remarks; but presently the elder
                  neighbor of Maurice threw out a feeler: "Are either of you gentlemen going to
                  attend the Bible Society meeting in the city?"—"No;," said the young man, "I am
                  going to see Professor ——, of the General Theological School, about missionary
                  work at the West."—"I am of opinion," interrupted a solemn-looking gentleman
                  opposite, with a thin, smooth-shaven face, and very decided cheek-bones, "that
                  there is but one thing which can save the West from Catholics and infidelity: it
                  is the general distribution of the Bible. We do not want missionaries, we want
                  colporteurs." (He pronounced the word "coalporters," but everybody appeared to
                  understand him.) "Don't know about that," replied the first speaker: "I'm not a
                  wonderful Bible man myself, but still I don't know that leaving them round in all
                  sorts of places is the way to make people think more of them. What do you say?" he
                  added, turning to Maurice and the other. "The Bible is the only source of our
                  faith; and by faith ye are saved," said the theological student. "P'raps there's
                  to be more saving than your Say brook platform will hold," replied the other:
                  "however, that's not the question."—"The American Bible Society have done a
                  magnificent work," said their <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vis--vis</foreign> before
                  described. "They have placed a copy of the precious volume in every house, in all
                  hotels and steamboats and railroad stations. Ah-h! it is a no-o-ble work,
                  sir."—"It is that very thing which leads, I fear," said Bryan, "to the greater
                  irreverence. When the Bible was daily read in the Churches, as at the Reformation,
                  it was listened to and respected: how is it now?"</p>
               <p>A listener, who sat silently by, tipped back his chair, made a long arm toward the
                  other table, and picked up the Bible lying there; and, without a word, slipped it
                  down into the midst of the group. They opened it: scurrilous, even<pb n="168-169"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000085"/> obscene scribbling covered the fly-leaves. They
                  turned over the printed matter; marginal drawings; underscoring of all the words
                  which the stricter usage of our days has banished from speech, and grossly
                  infidel, not to say blasphemous, foot-notes, showed the value of the experiment of
                  Bible distribution. "You see," said Maurice, quietly. Two red spots came out upon
                  the knobs of the prominent cheekbones opposite. The bystander who had taken the
                  Bible from the other table drew a pack of cards from his pocket: "Any gentleman
                  want to take a hand at Euchre?" said he; at which two of the company rose and
                  hurried off as if the pack had been a lighted shell. Maurice laughed, but with a
                  good-natured negative also rose. The elder man at his side gave a wistful glance
                  at the cards, then a look at the face of the proposer of the game. Something
                  seemed to appear therein which moved his bump of caution; for he said, "No, thank
                  ye; I'll go on deck and have a cigar. Come up, sir," he said to Maurice; "perhaps
                  you'll take one too, it's a fine night." As they emerged on the upper deck, the
                  man turned to Maurice. "I've no scruples about card-playing, but I don't play with
                  everybody I meet. I don't know what you think about the matter—I should judge you
                  wasn't a "professor?"-" No, sir," said Maurice, quite innocently; "I was offered a
                  place in a Western College, but I didn't fancy it."—"No, no; I mean a professor of
                  religion—a church member, you know."—"Oh," said Maurice, "if that is it, I suppose
                  I am; that is, I am a minister, a Unitarian minister."—"Well, I thought there was
                  something about you not just like one of them East-Windsor chaps. And where are
                  you going in <emph>this</emph> part of the world, if I may ask? Settled
                  anywhere?"—"Yes and no," said Maurice. "I am partly engaged to try a church in the
                  town of Norowam. It has been a Universalist society, but has gotten over that
                  notion. I believe I am to say nothing at all on that subject, but just to preach
                  liberal Christianity." "Then I shall come and hear you, for I live in Norowam. I'm
                  not a member, but I have been to your church and like it; and, from the way you
                  put down them Bible fellows at tea-time, I think I should like you, too. There is
                  one thing I'm going to tell you. I've tried various churches in Norowam, and the
                  Episcopal among the rest. I stuck there longest of all—got a pew there yet—but I
                  gave up because they wanted me to have the children baptized. Old Dr. Donne—he's a
                  good old man, he is, one of the best sort of men—was at me forever about it. I was
                  at his church, one day, when a lot of children was brought to be
                  christened—little, squalling things they were; and for every baby had to be a lot
                  of godmothers and godfathers, as they called them, to make the promises. Now, that
                  struck me as just so much humbug. What right had them folks to make promises to
                  bind that baby? What right had they to say what the child should believe? And then
                  for the doctor to make a prayer saying that these children were regenerated, just
                  because he had sprinkled a little water over them—that was more than I
                     <emph>could</emph> swallow! I don't mind hearing prayers read out of a book;
                  for, between you and me, there's a good many ministers gets a going in the praying
                  line, and don't know when nor where to stop. I haven't no objection to white
                  gowns—as I told the Baptist minister, it is better than ragged elbows—and I like
                  singing chants; but when I see children growing up half of them and choosing for
                  themselves, right against their fathers' and mothers' ways, I know it is no use
                  making church-members of them at six weeks old. There's them that experiences
                  religion, and gets immersed; I've nothing to say about that. There's them that is
                  sprinkled; and that's all very well if they know what they're a doing of; and
                  we—well, we take it by profession. I never tried it, but my wife has, and I never
                  had nothing to say; but this baby religion is only fit for babies."—"I am not so
                  sure of it," replied Maurice. "We do many things for children which they cannot
                  see the good of, which still are very good for them. If I adopt a child, I make a
                  different lot in life for it than it would have had. If it is to beggar out of the
                  streets or from a foundling hospital, it certainly gets a chance to become
                  something which it would not have done. But the sponsors, as you say, do seem very
                  like a form."—"Worse than that; don't you see they make the child think it has
                  promised? and so it grows up sort of bound to one Church, when, if it had been
                  left free to itself) it might have tried a dozen."—" But," said Maurice, "If there
                  was only one Church—and that is what baptism seems to mean—and if the promises are
                  what the child ought to make, what harm is there?"—"Why, you see, suppose the
                  child breaks the promise, somebody's got to answer for it. Catch me going<pb
                     n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7264-00000086"/> bail for a young one's good
                  behaviour!"—"But," still objected Bryan, fighting for what he had never thought to
                  defend, "but, supposing you did feel that you had gone bail, as you say, for a
                  child, and should try to make it do right, as a very sacred duty; should take an
                  interest in it, and set it a good example, and teach it good things, and be its
                  grown-up friend and helper, praying for it and all that—why wouldn't it be good
                  for the child?"—"Oh, but nobody ever does that! It's just hocus-pocus and
                  formalism; and then," coming back to the old point, like one who felt
                  instinctively where his strength lay, "the child mightn't choose your
                  Church."—"Well, ought there to be Churches to choose from? I wish, for my part,
                  that they were all one."—"No, that <emph>won't</emph> do, no how you
                     <emph>can</emph> fix it. Men is of different sorts; some needs hell-fire to
                  keep them straight, and some needs Methodist shoutings, and some needs a kind of
                  cheerful religion. Let a man have what he likes, <emph>I</emph> say. You ain't a
                  going to preach baptism up—are you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no!" said Maurice: "I only wanted to hear what you had to say. I expect to
                  preach liberal Christianity, and I confess I do not see much practical probability
                  of a union of all churches in one.</p>
               <p>"But tell me about Norowam. What sort of a society shall I find?" "Middlin' small,
                  but good. There's a prospect that lots of city folks may come there summers. The
                  Episcopalians have a big church, and the rich folks. The Baptists is split up.
                  There's the old Congregationalists,—and they've split too; and one half has gone
                  off to be Presbyterians,—got a real smart fellow too. They are mostly the new city
                  folks,—the old ones stick to their church on the green; and then the Methodists
                  are quite plenty. The Congregationalists have just quarrelled with their man:
                  They've had—lem me see—five men in the last twelve years,—and every one gone off
                  mad. We have only a little church, and our folks ain't rich. But what we want is a
                  smart young man, like yourself, to go into society and pick up the young
                  folks,—the girls especially,—and give pop'lar lectures, and write in the
                  magazines, and so on. You'll do, I guess, first rate; and I shall tell our folks
                  so. You know any body in New York?" "I preach for Dr. ——, next Sunday, in his new
                  church in —— Avenue." "All right! maybe some of us'll be down to hear you. And
                  now," said he, tossing his cigar over the vessel's side, "I'll turn in.
                  Good-night." Maurice went to his state-room, and read over, before he slept, the
                  Baptismal Service for infants in his Prayer-book. It certainly was both plain and
                  consistent, only Utopian. If it were to stand, where, sure enough,
                     <emph>was</emph> the child's liberty? And then he fell to musing upon that
                  liberty,—whether, after all, any great good was to be gained by it. The one thing
                  seemed to be, the loss of unity in the Church: there was the trouble. The
                  baptismal office made no provision for that. So, undressing, he began to consider
                  the vexed question of the unity of the Church, and—woke with the sun shining into
                  his state-room window, and the cheery noises of the New York docks sounding in his
                  ear.</p>
               <p>It was rather a dull week for Bryan in New York. Dr. —— for whom he was to preach,
                  was at his country-seat; and New York, in September, is not an enlivening place of
                  abode. There are picture shops, and book-stores, and the did Dsseldorf Gallery was
                  still existent; this, for a man who had spent months in the glorious corridors of
                  Dresden, and to whom every corner of the Borghese, Corsini, and Pamphili-Doria
                  palaces was familiar, was certainly not an absorbing delight. The thought occurred
                  to him to try and find the church where Ellen Winrow was baptized. He inquired at
                  his hotel for churches where was a dally service. He was promptly told of Trinity
                  and Trinity Chapel; but no one seemed to know of any others. "Opera opens next
                  week, and you'll get capital music there, sir," said the "gentlemanly and obliging
                  public functionary" who used to be called a clerk, and who presided over the hotel
                  register. However, Maurice did ramble by the doors of a little church, the beauty
                  of which attracted him, and the entrance of which he found open on a week-day. He
                  entered, and found service going on. A school of parish children in dark hoods and
                  neat calico dresses, cloth caps and gray tweed suits,—according to sex; and a
                  score, perhaps, of other worshippers, all ladies except one meek country minister,
                  who, now and then, responded in the wrong place. The clergyman officiating was
                  old, white-haired, and with a sweet, benignant face, which reminded him very
                  forcibly of Ellen's description. He waited almost impatiently for the close of the
                  prayers, and then followed the clergyman<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7264-00000087"
                  /> man into the vestry, to find him just putting off his surplice. He put the
                  question somewhat incoherently and abruptly, but was answered with all gentleness.
                  "Do you remember the year of the baptism you speak of?" Maurice did not,—could
                  only, after some hesitation, guess. The Rector unlocked a press, took down the
                  huge register, and began to read. Maurice was astonished at the number of baptisms
                  recorded. Page after page was traversed by that patient finger, until, with a
                  sigh, Maurice was about to own that the dates had been reached on either side of
                  all possibility of the event, and to give up the search, when the rector suddenly
                  paused, and looked up with this question:</p>
               <p>"Was not Mrs. Howard, the Rev. Mr. Howard's wife,—she was Letty ——, then,—one of
                  the witnesses?" Maurice endeavored to recall Ellen's story: "Yes, I think so," he
                  said. "Ah! I have it, then: here it is, left blank, you see, except the Christian
                  name, Ellen, the age, and my signature. Mrs. Howard has the certificate: it was to
                  be filled up here afterwards; but there were some family reasons for entering no
                  name, I think. Howard was to let me know." "The reasons can exist no longer," said
                  Maurice; "she rests with her family beneath the Atlantic. I came to see the font
                  and the church where she was baptized." "You are a relative? No! I see, I see,"
                  said the good clergyman, a tenderness coming into his voice, and he pressed
                  Maurice's hand: "come this way," and he led him back into the choir of the church.
                  "Here is the font; she knelt just here," he said: "poor child, poor child! Stay
                  here as long as you like; and, when you incline to come, follow that passage from
                  the vestry, and it will lead you to my study, and I will let you out." He turned
                  away, and left Maurice alone in the church.</p>
               <p>There is something very impressive to a thoughtful mind in the silence of a church
                  upon a week-day. Even the ugliest New England edifice, "meeting-house," from
                  underpinning to weathercock, cannot wholly thrust from its doors the staidness of
                  the Sunday atmosphere. Nor can even the smug and perking pretentiousness of the
                  modern "auditorium," where people meet to hear sermons and Sunday operatics,—all
                  sham and upholstery though it be,—altogether be made to seem like another place.
                  But a true church is a holy spot; one where, but for the evil shame of being
                  caught, we could gladly linger and pray. This was a true church,—stone walls,
                  wainscotted below with oak, pierced by narrow lancet windows filled with deep and
                  rich-hued glass; carved oaken stalls; and, behind the altar, a stately and
                  beautiful canopied reredos. Upon the holy table was set upright an open Bible. The
                  front was of white marble with sculptured panels. The eyes of the young man filled
                  with blinding tears as he looked upon it. He seemed to see kneeling there that
                  sweet figure, so simple and childlike, with her earnest face, and the smooth brown
                  hair folded above the fair forehead. Upon that spot he felt that he could not
                  kneel. He went apart into one of the open seats, and bent his knee, and bowed his
                  head, overweighted with the suppression of a long, long sorrow. Yet, in the tumult
                  of his thoughts, he could not pray. He could only wipe away the tears, and keep
                  "down the strong laboring of his bosom. At length peace came to him; at least the
                  resignation with which one can meet the inevitable. He rose and left the church.
                  He found the old Hector in his library. With a very gentle smile he welcomed
                  Maurice, and bade him to a seat. "Do you want to say anything to me?" he said,
                  "you know it is my office to hear and to help all troubles; and every young man is
                  my son, since I have none after the flesh." Maurice, moved by a sudden impulse,
                  told him his whole story. Tears were upon the good 'old man's cheeks ere the
                  recital was ended. "My son, you have indeed had your grief early; but whom the
                  Lord loveth he chasteneth. You have still one espousal to look forward to, if your
                  faith to your lost love does not change: you can, at the same font, take the same
                  vows."—"Perhaps—perhaps I may," and Maurice rose sadly; "but not now."—"In His
                  good time—in His good time, as the Lord will," said the old man, holding out his
                  hand. "Good by. God bless you, and bring you aright!"</p>
               <p>It was a great change to the church of Dr. ——, in which Maurice found himself on
                  the Sunday morning next. There was a thin congregation, made up out of the slender
                  remains of the two Unitarian Societies not out of town for the summer, and a few
                  strangers from the hotels. There was an audible rustle, and looks of
                  disappointment were exchanged from pew to pew, when the doctor appeared upon the
                  pulpit-platform followed by a stranger who wore<pb n="174-175"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000088"/> the black gown of the preacher. One or two who sat
                  near the door slipped quietly out. Everything about the edifice was oppressively
                  new and citified,—the freshest of varnish and smartest of upholstery. Pulpit and
                  pews alike seemed to say, "Look at us, we cost ever so much!" Nor did the service
                  do much to restore the devotional feeling. After the brief introductory prayer,
                  the doctor read a Psalm, or rather a composition of Psalms, for a chant. It was
                  read in rather a studied manner, and at its close the doctor looked hard at the
                  choir gallery opposite. There was no response from either organ or singers. It was
                  evident that they were not inclined to be "at home" before the season began. So,
                  opening the great Bible, he read part of a chapter, and then gave out a hymn,
                  which was sung by the two or three voices who were acting as temporary choir. Then
                  followed the long prayer, into which was infused a delicate dash of politics, not
                  strong enough to offend, but gratifying to those, who, from frequent pilgrimages
                  "over the ferry," had become unable to relish their worship without a mundane
                  flavoring. Then two verses more of a hymn were sung, and the pulpit was clear to
                  Maurice, who, from his elevation, could see the choir depart, and the organist,
                  who had to stay for the concluding voluntary, settle himself in an easy chair,
                  with a manifest novel in his hand. The doctor objected to Sunday papers because
                  they would rustle scandalously, and, after a long fight, carried his point; but
                  novels were permissible, provided the leaves were cut beforehand.</p>
               <p>Maurice made, of course, the beginner's blunder of pitching his voice too high;
                  and consequently delivered his sermon with great effort, and not much effect.
                  Still, he had the satisfaction of seeing some people rouse up in their pews, and
                  listen; and the doctor, a most amiable man, complemented him very highly upon his
                  maiden effort. There was no other service in the church during the day; but it hot
                  Sunday, and Maurice remained quietly was a in his off, he hotel. If he had known,
                  that, not many squares might have heard his friend Gardiner preach, perhaps his
                  history might have come to a speedier end than it now seems likely to do.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <p>IT was noon when Maurice alighted at the little station of Norowam. He found
                  himself in a pleasant village, with broad tree-shaded streets. In the centre, the
                  old Puritan meeting-house stood, sentinel-like, on the green, confronting all
                  comers with an interrogative look out of its many windows. To the right of it was
                  the hotel to which he was driven,—whither the will of his hackman conducted him.
                  He found, of course, no extraordinary luxury, but the promise of pleasant social
                  entertainment in the presence of several agreeable-looking boarders. He went forth
                  after dinner to find the house of his possible parishioner, to whom he had a
                  letter. He was not over sanguine of success, but, to his surprise, was most
                  cordially welcomed by the managing man of the little society,—he who, to use his
                  own words, mainly runs the concern. It was his business partner whom Maurice had
                  met on board the steamboat. He was told that everything had been arranged, "The
                  fact is, we thought it best," said the manager, "not to have you come preaching on
                  trial. It sets folks up to think they can find fault. It is better just to have a
                  few who dooz know su'thin' about it to attend to it: they're just as much pleased
                  in the end. Some of us went to New York last Sunday—awful hot, warn't it?—a
                  purpose to hear you; and we're only too glad to have you come. We have made an
                  effort, and I think we can raise nine hundred or a thousand for you, which, as
                  you're a bachelor, will be better than we've ever done before. 'Doctor,' he said,
                  'we couldn't expect to get you under fifteen hundred;' but says I to him, says I,
                  'Tain't no kind o' use talking that to our people. There is the pew-rents and the
                  letting of the parsonage, that's so much; and, when that's done, every cent of it
                  has got to come out of private pockets;' and says I, 'when Mr. Maurice has been<pb
                     n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7264-00000089"/> with us a year, he'll know how many of
                  them there is as has got much in 'em.' But you mustn't be discouraged, in case you
                  was thinking of getting married by and by. The town in full of summer visitors
                  from the city, and you are just the one to draw. Only you mustn't leave us in the
                  lurch, and go off to a city parish, as soon as the summer is over."</p>
               <p>Maurice was too full of the novelty and pride of his position to do other than to
                  assent cordially to this proposition. He was flattered at the estimate put upon
                  him, and very glad to get to work; and he walked forth with his entertainer to see
                  his future church. It was small, but centrally situated; in fact, it watched the
                  meeting-house on the green with the air of a Skye terrier bristling up at a great
                  indolent Newfoundlander. To this look, its high-pitched roof between two wooden
                  turrets, which were like pocket-telescopes, contributed not a little. In its gable
                  was a pointed window, with Tudor mouldings; and along the eaves ran wooden
                  battlements. Its capacity for seating was about three hundred. Maurice surveyed it
                  inside and out with the pleasure, and yet with the dignity, proper to one assuming
                  his first charge. Then he went to tea at his new parishioner's house, where he was
                  received with great deference; but evidently the young people were slightly
                  oppressed by his presence. So, after tea, his host having to "go to the store,"
                  Maurice excused himself, and started for a walk around the village.</p>
               <p>He followed up the course of the stream from which the village takes its name,—the
                  Norowam. He crossed a small bridge, leaning over the railing, while he lingered,
                  to enjoy the lovely little vista which opened up and down the stream,—tall trees
                  bending over it, even to the edge of the green, turfy banks, and the shallow,
                  rippling current showing beneath, here and there, the mossy stones. Then he passed
                  on, and came round by a circuit to a grave-yard, in front of which were the
                  unfinished walls of an edifice manifestly ecclesiastical. It was of rough native
                  granite, with smooth brown-stone dressings in the door-ways and arches of the
                  windows. Maurice wandered around it, till at one corner he found a stone with a
                  floriated cross cut into it. Beneath this was the name in Gothic letters,—<q>
                     <p>St. Marks.</p>
                  </q> The interior was strewn with fragments of stone; neither roof nor floor were
                  yet begun.</p>
               <p>The bells just then began to ring for evening service, for it was Wednesday night.
                  Maurice gave a glance into the little neglected-looking grave-yard, with its rough
                  and tumbling stone wall; marked the overgrown, untidy aspect it presented; and
                  then the idea came to him, that now would be a capital opportunity to see his
                  ministerial rivals, or some of them. So he followed the tolling bells back into
                  the main street. He passed one fresh-looking edifice,; but it was unlighted. When
                  he reached the old Puritan meeting-house, though its bell went, its doors seemed
                  closed. He asked a passer-by where the service was to be held. "Prayer-meetin' in
                  the lecture-room, over to the new church." So Maurice, catching sight of a Gothic
                  tower and spire through the trees, followed the toll of its bell. He found it
                  standing rather apart, among pleasant villa residences, and in front of a
                  triangular green, around which were set a few straggling elm-slips; and in the
                  centre a bare spot marked the play-place of the village boys. The church was a
                  large building, wooden, with plenty of battlements pinnacles, and buttresses. Its
                  proportions, however, were not unpleasing. Maurice looked in through the arched
                  door-ways. He saw that the lamps were lighted upon a heavy desk and pulpit of dark
                  wood. Each stood distinct, and between and behind them appeared the chancel and
                  chancel-rail. He was struck with the length of the church, made more apparent by
                  the few worshippers who were scattered here and there. "Well, this is coming to
                  headquarters of the enemy," he said to himself, as he quietly slipped into a side
                  pew. When the bell ceased tolling, the church was about a quarter filled. Some
                  families appeared in full force, coming in in quite a compact body, and filling
                  two or three pews contiguous, while in other places single church-goers sat alone.
                  The clergyman entered by a narrow, arched door, on the side of which was a
                  monumental tablet, the black lettering of which Maurice in vain attempted to read.
                  There were two ministers; one of them a large, elderly man, with a full rotund
                  face, and gray hair. It was a face with a grave, reverent expression, with
                     lines<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7264-00000090"/> which might either]harden to
                  sternness or soften to sweetness. The other was evidently young, quite young. His
                  hair, quite long and with something of a wave, was very fine and silken, and
                  brushed back from his brow. It fell around the smooth oval of a face whose perfect
                  features, in their almost womanish perfection, had a marked likeness to that
                  beautiful ideal which the Italian painters have chosen for Saint John the Divine.
                  The impression of the face was rather that of purity than of power. The service
                  was read by the elderly clergyman, with that quiet, natural impressiveness which
                  belongs to a class passing away,—the noble, hard-working, unpretending, but
                  earnest and really most able men, who belonged to the Church's militant days,
                  before ambitious youths were taught to intone badly, and to vindicate their
                  apostolicity by murder of the Queen's English. There was no organ or chanting; but
                  a metrical psalm was given out at the close of the evening prayer, and the tune
                  set by one of the congregation. It was sung rather falteringly till the young
                  clergyman rose from his knees, after his private devotions, and threw into it the
                  support of a voice evidently of high culture and great natural sweetness. As the
                  "Gloria" ceased, he came forward to the rail of the narrow chancel, and began his
                  lecture. He announced no text, but went at once to the subject,—that of
                  Confirmation. After running briefly over the warrant for the rite, its institution
                  by the apostles in Samaria, and then making a few citations from the Fathers, he
                  began to speak of what it was,—the ratifying and confirming of the Baptismal vows
                  on the part of the candidate, and the ratifying and confirming to the candidate of
                  the Divine pledges made in Holy Baptism. Maurice listened attentively. Here, amid
                  the fluent and apparently commonplace remarks of the young clergyman, was struck
                  out a thought which to him was full of importance. The mystery of infant baptism,
                  the meaningless formalism, as it had seemed to him, of the sponsors, was all at
                  once put in a new light. The promise by the infant was then real,—only in abeyance
                  for a season. But, with this, the promise to the infant,—spiritual regeneration,
                  was not <emph>that</emph> also confirmed? He followed the simple words, so lacking
                  in argumentative arrangement, so full of broad and positive assertion, half
                  rebelling against them. He saw, or thought he saw, points missed, and loopholes
                  holes left for question; but, in spite of this, the sincere, eager earnestness,
                  and the clear, assured sense, on the part of the speaker, of his position, was
                  telling upon him. Scornfully he tried to throw it off: but the while there was
                  wrought out, clearer and clearer, the conviction that the young Minister was
                  speaking with something back of him; that he had a firm, definite theory of the
                  relation of the baptized child: and with this the thought came, that this theory
                  was <emph>not</emph> unreasonable. Holding the Prayer-book in his hand, and
                  reading passages of the service, and then turning to the Catechism and Collects
                  for corroborating testimony, the preacher showed that he was teaching the familiar
                  doctrine of his Church. Then, with a fire which Maurice had hardly suspected in
                  him, he closed with a direct appeal to those present to come forward at the
                  Bishop's approaching visitation.</p>
               <p>Maurice rose from his place, after the benediction, and went up to read the
                  memorial tablet. It told him, that the Rev. Adoniram Griffith, D. D., had been for
                  fifty years the Rector of the parish, of which he was the founder. Maurice turned
                  to go, as the sexton was putting out the lights. Two or three ladies were
                  conversing in low tones in the porch. The younger clergyman of St. Jude's—for that
                  was the church's name—came hastily down the aisle and greeted them. One of them
                  turned to reply as Maurice passed; and, in the vestibule lamplight, Maurice found
                  himself face to face with Maud de Forrest. An exclamation of surprise broke from
                  his lips, and, at the same moment, a smile and blush of recognition came over her
                  face. That face was more beautiful than when he had first seen it. She held out
                  her hand in greeting. "How did you come here?" she said. "Why, this is to be my
                  home; I am now a minister." She glanced at his straight-cut coat—which Maurice had
                  ordered of a church tailor of undoubted orthodoxy—and his white neck-cloth, and
                  said, "What! of the Church? Why were you not in the chancel to-night?"—"No, not
                  this Church; I did not mean that; but a minister in this town—Norowam. I am
                  preaching at the Universal is. Church; but you see I can come here with pleasure
                  and," slightly bowing to the young clergyman, Maurice added, "with profit."—"Mr.
                  Maurice," said Maud, "Jet me introduce to you my cousin, the Rev. Alfred Winthrop.
                  We met Mr.<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7264-00000091"/> Maurice, Alfred, in
                  Rome—uncle and I." They walked down the street together, Miss de Forrest chatting
                  with more animation than formerly, asking and answering questions of their common
                  travels, while Winthrop walked silently on the other side. Two other ladies of the
                  party were just before, but Winthrop made no effort to join them. Maurice half
                  suspected that he was considered <foreign xml:lang="FRA">de trop</foreign> by one
                  of the party. The fact was, that Winthrop was only too tired, after preaching, to
                  care to use his voice in the night air. They reached one of the villa-like
                  dwellings of the town, where the ladies went in. "I shall be happy to have you
                  call," said Miss de Forrest, as she held out her hand at parting. The two young
                  men turned to go. "Where are you stopping?" said Winthrop.—"I am at the
                  hotel."—"So am I; this, then, is our way." They walked on together. "We shall see
                  more of each other, I suspect," said Maurice; "let me tell you who I am." But his
                  confidence did not waken any very eager response. The other listened courteously
                  to his story, but, when it was finished, simply replied, "I am not here
                  permanently; only assisting the Rev. Cyril Donne, the Rector of St. Jude's, while
                  the regular assistant is abroad. I shall be happy to see you at my rooms, which
                  are, like yours, in the hotel, when you are disposed to call. But I am quite busy
                  just now, and have little leisure for visiting till after the Bishop has been
                  here. I would ask you in to-night, but am very tired, and must beg you to excuse
                  me."</p>
               <p>Maurice bade him good-night, and sat awhile on the veranda, thinking over the day.
                  "Winthrop! Winthrop! a Boston name, and he has the Beacon-street air; but he is
                  too young to be a Harvard man before my time, or I should have seen him." The fact
                  was, Winthrop was of Trinity. And so ended Bryan's entry into Norowam. At first,
                  Maurice, though they met at meal-times, saw very little of his new acquaintance.
                  He was speedily made aware, by his manager, that he must get acquainted with his
                  flock; and was taken about indefatigably, to be introduced to the Darlings, the
                  Swifts, the Selwoods, the Munceys, Widow White, and the maiden sisters Wray, and
                  all the good people of his flock, mostly the trades-people or old residents of the
                  place. All urged upon him the importance of standing well with a certain family
                  that were living that summer in the old Ponacus manor-house on Ponacus Point. This
                  family—the Grahams—were city people, who might stay up for the winter, and whose
                  advent had evidently caused no little sensation in the little society. If the
                  Sunday were pleasant, he would see them. They were very rich, and quite disposed
                  to patronize the body in which they worshipped.</p>
               <p>What with furnishing his room, unpacking his books,—which arrived Saturday,—he
                  found no leisure to call on Miss de Forrest, or to look in upon Winthrop. The
                  weather was exhaustingly warm, and the hotel hot, noisy and uncomfortable.</p>
               <p>Sunday came, and with it the necessity of his first service. He found the little
                  edifice well filled; and no small stir and rustle took place, as, with as slow and
                  dignified a step as his nerves would permit, he walked up the aisle, and took his
                  place in the pulpit. He knelt for a moment in private prayer, somewhat to the
                  astonishment of a portion of the people; but his thoughts were so little composed,
                  that he had recourse to a brief form he had found in one of his Episcopalian books
                  of devotion, As he. rose, the choir, led by a melodeon, opened with a very showy
                  anthem. That gave him time to regain his self-possession a little; so that, with a
                  tolerably steady voice, he was able to offer the short introductory prayer. He
                  then read (ambitiously, of course, but not without effectiveness) the hymn, and,
                  while the choir were singing it, found the chapter from which his text was taken.
                  The reading of its grand and simple words helped him wonderfully in overcoming the
                  awkward sensation of being looked at; so that, when he once more said "Let us
                  pray," he was enabled to abstract himself from his novel attitude. He had in his
                  first petition used nearly word for word the familiar language of his
                  college-chapel days; but now he was thrown upon his own resources. But for his
                  Prayer-book studies he would have broken down. As it was, he found great relief in
                  sliding into well-remembered phrases, and was heartily glad to find himself at the
                  final "Amen." While the second hymn was being sung, he made a mental vow to
                  introduce a liturgy at the first opportunity.</p>
               <p>When he opened his sermon, and announced his text, he felt comparatively at ease.
                  There was enough of magnetism in the sympathy of his audience; and he felt, that,
                  by culture and experience, he was fully up to their average<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000092"/> level. So he gave himself up to the work of
                  delivery. It was a creditable effort. Of course, it was above the heads of the
                  congregation; but that did no harm. The clear, chaste style, which his Cambridge
                  training had given him, could not fail to tell. Above all, it was a new speaker, a
                  new face, and new thoughts: at least, a new dress for old ones. He had
                  incorporated into it a little of his Broad-Church theories, about taking from
                  every quarter whatever was good and beautiful. Faces lighted up as they listened
                  to his earnest, if impracticable, visions.</p>
               <p>It is wonderful how eagerly the Unitarian mind feeds on this fancy. Like the
                  Tartar khan, whose heralds proclaim, when he has finished his repast of mare's
                  milk and dates, that the rest of the world may go to dinner; so the almost
                  microscopic company of "Liberal Christians" delight to permit, patronizingly, the
                  holy Catholic Church throughout the world to banquet on their leavings. All sects
                  and all ages are their property. Happy little summer flies! <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">Dum vivimus, vivamus!</foreign> Let them enjoy in their brief
                  season; and when we lay to rest, in the pleasant shades of Mount Auburn, the last
                  of the race, let us say over him, "He was a Liberal Christian and nothing
                  ecclesiastical was alien to him."</p>
               <p>Maurice was not long in learning of the effect of his first sermon. It was
                  intimated to him in the grave glances of his leading men, and the more timid, but
                  enthusiastic, looks of half a score of young ladies. A handsome private carriage
                  was at the door, with a coachman in plain livery on the box. Two ladies were
                  already seated, and an elderly gentleman stood at the step. He advanced to meet
                  Maurice, and held out his hand. "My name is Graham," he said: "my friend Dr. ——,
                  of New York, for whom you preached last Sunday, spoke to me of you. We are
                  delighted to have you here; and you have interested us all exceedingly to-day. "We
                  shall be happy to see you at Ponacus. My wife and daughter, Mr. Maurice." The
                  ladies bowed; but the horses were fretting impatiently, and permitted no longer
                  conversation. The carriage whirled away; but a hand was laid on Maurice's
                  shoulder, and his manager stood before him, his face shining with heat and
                  satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"You've done it for them folks," he said: "Graham says to me, as he came out,
                  'We're much obliged to you, Mr. Swift, for giving us such a treat;' and I heard
                  Miss Graham say to him, 'You'll have to build him a new church here, if we come up
                  to stay the year round Come home and dine with us We're plain folks, Mr. Maurice;
                  but we can give you as good a dinner as Graham could."</p>
               <p>The good dinner and the smaller congregation combined against Maurice's second
                  effort: but the greater freedom he felt perhaps corrected that; and, as he walked
                  home from the afternoon church, many eyes looked admiringly after him.</p>
               <p>He was quite tired, but it was mental and nervous fatigue more than physical; and
                  so, after tea, hearing St. Jude's bell ring, he went off to soothe it there.</p>
               <p>This time the old Rector preached, Winthrop reading the prayers. Maurice at first
                  criticised coldly. But, by and by, the warm earnestness of the gray-haired man won
                  upon him, and the homely arguments were not powerless. It was not in the way of
                  any direct proof, but the evident conviction of the speaker in the Lord's
                  divinity, which impressed and provoked him. From that as a centre seemed to
                  radiate all his thought. Maurice had always assumed the prime mistake of all
                  Unitarian teaching, that the divinity of Christ was a deduction from the supposed
                  necessity of an atonement, and a theological system built thereon. Here was the
                  reverse. Christ, God, required the atonement; not the atonement that Jesus should
                  be God, Upon this was built the whole fabric of a visible Church. The position
                  annoyed him by its reasonableness. His first feeling was one of spleen, as if the
                  enemy had forsaken the ground on which he ought to have been allowed to attack,
                  and had retreated to an intrenched camp. What right had this man to forsake all
                  that he had been sedulously learning to overthrow in his Divinity-school
                  studies?</p>
               <p>He dropped into Winthrop's room after the service. The young clergyman received
                  him less formally than before, and was disposed to talk. They found that they
                  had." many acquaintances in common; and Alfred Winthrop was one of those capital
                  fellows who cannot help thawing out to any true and gentlemanly advances. Maurice
                  was too full of his theological troubles to keep away from them. He took advantage
                  of the first pause to dash into the subject. "I<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000093"/> heard you preach the other night," he said; "and I
                  own I was quite convinced of what you said, granting your point of view. But how
                  do you know what children to baptize?" Winthrop started. "I mean, how do you
                  recognize the elect?"—"We don't; we baptize all who are properly presented for
                  baptism. <emph>All</emph> children are elect; that is, I mean, Christ died for all
                  mankind."—"But do you mean that all are saved? Why, then, are you so hard on the
                  Universalists?"—"No, of course not: those who accept him as a Saviour are saved,
                  those who reject him are lost."—"But the children cannot accept him?"—"Yes, they
                  do: that is my very point in Confirmation."—"But suppose they die before
                  that?"—"If they die as irresponsible infants, they are received into Christ's
                  kingdom, of course." "But if they are not baptized?"—" That not being their fault,
                  they, perhaps, are not to be held guilty; but, since all men can come to holy
                  baptism if they will, the adults, at least, must take the consequences of refusal.
                  Meanwhile, we have to do all we can to see that the children do not suffer from
                  our neglect. I was last week in every house in Connemara,—that is, you know, the
                  Irish quarter of Norowam over here,—looking up Protestant children. We baptized
                  twelve, the doctor and I, this afternoon."—"But how do you get sponsors?"—"Well,
                  that is hard, but their Sunday-school teachers almost always, and any who will
                  take an interest in them. We are improving in this. I hope to get the sponsors to
                  come up with them to Confirmation some day, and so fulfil their obligation of
                     <emph>taking care</emph> that the children be brought to the Bishop."—"But how
                  do you get the children to come to Sunday-school? They tell me that my
                  Sunday-school is very small, and that I had better not trouble myself about it.
                  There are jealousies about classing poor children with rich ones, I fancy?"—"We
                  have no such trouble, or rather, we cut all that very short; and, as for getting
                  children to come, the trouble is to keep them from coming against their parents'
                  wishes. Christmas and Easter are such grand times for children."—"Oh!" said
                  Maurice, with a half sigh, "your Church system,—it is certainly one of the
                  prettiest of theories, so long as one can believe it: I wish I could."—"My dear
                  fellow, it is <emph>real.</emph> What you want is to stop thinking about Christmas
                  and Easter as pleasant English customs, and get to the reason why the Englishman
                  loves them,—because they are concerning the Birth and Resurrection of our Lord.
                  You must make that real first."—"There is the puzzle to me, how one's abstract
                  theology can make any difference with the practical every-day work of the
                  Church?"—"It is not abstract. You must find Christ real, incarnate, in His Church.
                  The Church is Christ's body, you know."—"No; I don't know any such thing. Who says
                  so?"—"St. Paul said something very like it in one, if not in more, of his
                  Epistles."</p>
               <p>"Come now, are you serious?" said Maurice; but, seeing Winthrop was looking rather
                  shocked, turned the conversation, and took his leave soon after. Winthrop was
                  inclined to be very distant after this, for a season. Being a young man, just at
                  the age to which the priesthood was permissible by the canons of his Church, he
                  could not see much else in Maurice but sinful and shocking heresy, which was to be
                  combated in a downright manner. However, they were at the same table, and were
                  drawn by the same general sympathies, and could not help meeting and talking', and
                  so, by slow, cross-grained ways, getting to know each other better.</p>
               <p>We have said, or intimated, that the Congregationalists of Norowam had just got a
                  new man. The history of that society was one and the same with the other two
                  hundred and fifty of Connecticut. It had once been the dominant one of the place.
                  It was the sick lion of the fable now. A large and wealthy section had become
                  Presbyterian, not because it doubted the validity of Independent Orders, but
                  because it had quarrelled with the leading men of the "First Church," and
                  preferred to separate. The Baptists had nibbled at their edges, the Methodists had
                  plundered them at the close of a grand revival, and, worst of all, there was a
                  steady drift of the young people into St. Jude's. So the society, feeling a little
                  pinched, and seeing some vacant pews, had fallen back upon their biennial
                  resource, which was to quarrel with their pastor, and get a new one. This, after
                  three months of trying, they had just succeeded in. The Rev. Augustine Ralston had
                  preached as a candidate, one Sunday, and taken them all by storm. He was not,
                  however, the great Augustine Ralston, D. D., but the nephew of that distinguished
                  luminary of New Englandism. He<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7264-00000094"/> received
                  a very hearty call, and accepted it with due cavalier nonchalance, which showed
                  what card he intended to play.</p>
               <p>With the Puritan ministry of New England, there is just one single alternative.
                  Either they, must rule the congregation, or let the congregation rule them. It is
                  a despotism which sometimes stands on its head, and sometimes on its heels, but
                  ever a despotism. The recalcitrant deacons, the dissentient church-members, must
                  be crushed, or the minister must be under the thumb of every old Manse Headrigg in
                  the parish; and his wife will not dare to say her soul, much less her bonnet, is
                  her own. Therefore Augustine did nicely in taking the initiative. The first attack
                  is half the battle. Moreover, he felt the more confident, since, in the event of
                  coming defeat, there was open to him those safe fortresses of "agencies,"
                  secretaryships, and the like, which run in the families of leading sectarian
                  divines, one knows not precisely how, but after the manner of that nepotism which
                  is supposed to flourish beneath the shadow of the Vatican. He was a keen, wary,
                  yet genial man, very fond of art, with that uncultivated, indiscriminate fondness
                  for it which repress is apt to produce, like the Quaker girls longing after bright
                  hues, and the Quaker youth's fervor for theatricals. He was a great, though
                  slightly indiscriminate, amateur in music; had notions about architecture; and was
                  well, but diffusely read. He was extraordinarily independent in his views,—indeed,
                  his ideas were subversive of all the old Puritan platforms, and he loved to air
                  them in controversy. He was not a little in the mood of the Irishman who was
                  "blue-moulded for want of a bating," when he came to Norowam. He was not
                  quarrelsome,—far from it. Gentlemanly, kindly, and thoroughly even-tempered, but
                  having grown up in a school which regards all opinions rather as the foils with
                  which you show your skill in fence than as the sword with which one fights for
                  life and death, he was always on the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">qui vive</foreign>
                  for battle.</p>
               <p>However, he came to the same hotel with Maurice and Winthrop, and was naturally
                  set down at the table in their neighborhood. Winthrop was not inclined for long
                  chats, being busy as a bee; but Ralston, who was ready to attack the episcopacy of
                  the one and the heresy of the other, had contrived, in a dexterous way, to assume
                  to himself a sort of arbitration—became a conversational solvent in drawing
                  Maurice and Winthrop into better acquaintance.</p>
               <p>One of these talks had so for a bearing on the story that it needs to be given.
                  Ralston's first attempt was upon Winthrop. Indeed, he rather ignored Maurice at
                  first, till the latter set him right upon a point of history, which Ralston, to do
                  him all justice, received with entire good nature. Provoking as he could be, when
                  you came to know him, it was impossible to quarrel with him. He <emph>was</emph>
                  provoking, however. He took advantage of a silence at the dinner-table to address
                  Winthrop so pointedly as to draw the attention of all upon him. "Brother Winthrop,
                  when shall we have the pleasure of an exchange?"—"Thank you, Mr. Ralston, I shall
                  be engaged till after Christmas, and then I shall probably leave." Ralston bit his
                  lip, but resumed, "I take it, this is an admission that you would exchange with me
                  if you were at liberty?"—"I can't say that it is," was the reply. "I'don't know
                  you well enough to ask you into my pulpit."—"Oh, I can give you first-rate
                  credentials."—"One will do; when you will bring me the Bishop's testimonial, that
                  will be all I shall ask."—"That is easily enough done; there is Bishop Ralston, my
                  father, and the Bishop of Hartford, and the Bishop of Maromus, and the Bishop of
                  Norfield, twenty Bishops."—"H'm," said Winthrop, with a slight twinkle in his eye,
                  "'I want better assurance than Bardolph's; I like not the security Besides, there
                  is another reason I ought to have given. I have no pulpit to invite you into at
                  present; I am only Dr. Donne's assistant." "Come, now, that is mere fencing with
                  the question. Would you exchange with me if you had the power?" "No, I would not,"
                  said Winthrop, tired of this badgering, "or with any other who tried to tease me
                  into it." "Oh! that is not the reason. I am not pressing you to do' the thing,
                  only to say why you are unwilling. Now, be frank; say it is because you do not
                  hold my orders to be valid." "Very well, Mr. Ralston, you knew that perfectly
                  well; you knew, before you asked me, that no Episcopal clergyman in this Diocese
                  would exchange with you, or consider you to be a lawful minister; and you ought to
                  know, too, that, because it might be disagreeable to you, any of us would shrink
                  from stating unnecessarily what we all believe.<pb n="188-189"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000095"/> If you wish me to say it, however, I have not the
                  smallest hesitation. I do not consider you, in any sense, a validly ordained
                  minister, and, unless you are in a different position from most
                  Congregationalists, you are a teacher of heresy." "Well!" broke in another of the
                  boarders, "that <emph>is</emph> polite; I must say that is Christian talk for a
                  gospel minister."—"Yes," said Maurice, who had been quietly listening, "it
                     <emph>is</emph> polite. Mr. Ralston has been for ten minutes trying to make Mr.
                  Winthrop say this. It is evident that his feelings would have been hurt if he had
                  not succeeded in making Mr. Winthrop say it. As to it being Christian, if Mr.
                  Winthrop believes it, it is perfectly Christian for him to say so. You, sir,"
                  turning to the interposing party, a manifest layman, "were very indignant last
                  Monday, because that Spiritualist woman called herself a minister of the Gospel.
                  Was it unchristian in you to say she was not?" "Oh, that was different; the Bible
                  says women should not speak in the churches." "The Bible may have something to say
                  on Mr. Winthrop's side also."</p>
               <p>Ralston nodded good-humoredly across the table. He was too quick not to see when
                  he was fairly met, and too candid not to enjoy it.</p>
               <p>"But why," said Maurice, turning to him," don't you ask me? I am a
                  Congregationalist, like yourself." "Not in fellowship with the Windfield
                  Con-sociation." "Is that necessary? You exchange with Dr. Knox, the Methodist; and
                  you have asked Mr. Winthrop, who, I am sure, is not in fellowship with the
                  Windfield Con-sociation." "Oh, we extend the courtesy of our pulpits to the
                  Orthodox denominations, to any Evangelical Christians." "Well?" said Maurice. "But
                  you are a Unitarian." "I "don't admit that. I stand upon the declaration of faith
                  of my congregation. I have it' here," said Maurice, pulling out a little square
                  pamphlet. "You admit the right of each body of Christians to frame its own
                  professions?" "Yes—that is, with some limitations." "And you cannot refuse us the
                  privilege of stating the doctrine of the Trinity in our own terms. If you do, Mr.
                  Winthrop may have a word to say about varying from the Nicene Creed." I make a
                  distinction," said Ralston, rousing a little; "that cannot be called a statement
                  of doctrine which in terms denies it." "Does our confession of faith? Do you know
                  it?" "Ah!—well, I conclude, of course, it does, or you are not holding to it."
                  "Wait and see!" Maurice read the introductory part of his Church's Creed. It had
                  been drawn up to keep in a portion of the Universalists who were Orthodox—that is,
                  held the Trinity, but not eternity of retribution. It carefully neither affirmed
                  nor denied, but could fairly be taken either way. It was, in fact, a guarded
                  statement cleverly put together out of Scripture texts. "Well—ah!—yes, I am glad
                  you are so orthodox; but, you see, there is more to come; universal salvation
                  does, in fact, destroy all the other statements." Maurice tossed his little
                  pamphlet across the table to him. That remarkable document had also been carefully
                  devised so as to meet the views of some old-fashioned Unitarians, who liked to
                  have a fair outlook toward the penalty side of the universe. Ralston turned and
                  twisted; but the words were all Scripture—nothing, in fact, but a mosaic of texts.
                  "Very well put, indeed, Mr. Maurice, yours; but, I think, under the known
                  impression which the word 'Universalist' carries with it, a certain rule of
                  interpretation must modify these words." "Pardon me," said Maurice, "I deny that.
                  You refuse me a right of general comity. It is for you to show affirmatively that
                  you are justified, not for me to prove my good standing. Besides, Universalist may
                  mean nothing more than a synonyme for Catholic. Brother Winthrop has a prayer in
                  his liturgy about the 'Holy Church Universal And, again, Universalist is the name
                     <emph>you</emph> gave <emph>us,</emph> not we to ourselves. 'The First
                  Christian Society in Norowam? is, as you may see, our proper name." Winthrop
                  laughed outright. Ralston looked annoyed. He was better used to playing at that
                  game than of suffering by it, and he could read upon one or two faces that he was
                  getting the worst of it in their opinion. "If yours is a Congregational platform,
                  as you contend," he said, finally—"and, by reason of its ambiguities, I cannot
                  well deny it without further study—then you are guilty of schism in establishing
                  it in a town where there is already a Congregational Church." (" Schism from
                     <emph>what?</emph>" said Winthrop, softly to himself.) "And more than that, I
                  must say that it is both disingenuous and discourteous in your people—not in you,
                  Mr. Maurice, this was before you came, when <emph>we</emph> were the First Church
                  of Christ in Norowam-to take a name so near our own." With this<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000096"/> parting shot, he jumped up from the table and
                  disappeared.</p>
               <p>"Winthrop," said Maurice, with profound gravity, "after this you will excuse me
                  from asking you to exchange. I cannot concede to you valid orders, as I have none
                  myself; nor a sound faith, since you use the Apostles' Creed, which is susceptible
                  both of a Unitarian and Universalist application." "Some day," said Winthrop,
                  looking steadily at him, "I am sure I shall ask you, and break no canon by doing
                  it either, or I am much mistaken:" and he held out his hand, adding, with a warm
                  pressure, "It will be a happy day for me; for I like you, Maurice."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <p>MAURICE went into his work with plenty of enthusiasm. He could not or would not
                  see that his people were not going along with him. In truth, they yielded at first
                  with a sort of puzzled and amused good-nature which he mistook for entire
                  acquiescence. He had no great experience of the class to which his congregation
                  mainly belonged, and did not even suspect the resolute, hard and unchanging
                  Connecticut character which lay beneath their apparent ductility. One of his plans
                  was to revive the Sunday School. This, though he did not know it, had been a sore
                  bone of contention and had caused the downfall of one of his predecessors. When
                  Maurice spoke of his intention at the house of his manager, one of the young
                  ladies exchanged significant glances with her mother, and her father said after a
                  moment's pause—"Well, I don't know, Mr. Spaulding, he didn't make much out of it
                  Our folks doesn't care so much about Sunday Schools as some does." Maurice was
                  utterly unaware of the depth of meaning which lay beneath this simple and guarded
                  sentence. He did not suspect it was meant for a warning, and went on with his
                  plans and his eagerness. After he had gone the good wife said—"Now father why
                  didn't you tell Mr. Maurice what trouble Mr. Spaulding had?" "He'll find out soon
                  enough—and p'raps, as he's a different sort of a man from what Spauldin' was, he
                  may make out better. Anyhow, I like a man to try what he wants to try, and then if
                  it don't succeed, he knows where his weak pints is. Mr. Maurice has got to make
                  some blunders, and he might just as well make them now while he is popular. Any
                  rate he shan't have to say we headed him off, and Sary Ann and 'Mandy Jane—or one
                  on 'em will have to take a class for him—'twon't last long, girls." So Maurice set
                     to<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7264-00000097"/> work—enlisted the prettiest and
                  cleverest girls he could find for teachers, and then proceeded to gather the
                  children. The congregation did not furnish him many. He found that most of his
                  flock were single young men in stores, mechanics who did not come to church
                  much—several old maids and a residuum of families which had as it were collected
                  from the leakages of other societies. In fact he had, though he did not know it,
                  the crooked sticks of the village wood-pile—or, to use another metaphor, the
                  monuments of all the past old feuds. There was Rhoda Andrews who had once been a
                  burning light of the Baptists, but had left them in the days of the great slander
                  case which divided Bethesda Church and set up Siloam tabernacle by the pond. There
                  were the Styles family who deserted St. Jude's because of the cap-pattern quarrel
                  with old Mrs. Rounseville. They called it Dr. Donne's Puseyism, but everybody knew
                  what <emph>that</emph> meant. Then Weston Hicks had "quit the Congregationalists
                  at the time Parson Brooks was created so shameful." Pratt also the jeweller had
                  been disciplined by the Methodists in a matter involving the fineness and purity
                  of the gold he dealt in. And then, oddest of all, side by side in their respective
                  pews sate Sam Saunders who retired from the Presbyterians, because the Parson
                  would preach about slavery, and Justin C. Sorr, who left St. Jude's because the
                  Rector declined to make that his sole topic. Nevertheless in all these families
                  the children were not disturbed in their old associations, but kept on where they
                  were wont to go—or else had been permitted to select for themselves. Not more than
                  a dozen could be fairly counted on in the congregation.</p>
               <p>Then Maurice undertook a regular visiting tour among the poorer families of the
                  town in hopes of stragglers. He spoke of this innocently enough to Winthrop one
                  day at dinner. Winthrop gave one sharp side glance at him and said nothing, but
                  finished his meal rather abruptly. Half an hour afterward two of the prettiest and
                  brightest girls in Norowam were watching the young Unitarian as he walked down
                  Carleton street, and ten minutes after he passed were upon his track. Each house
                  that he entered was noted, and not a child was lost to St. Jude's Sunday School.
                  Maurice however did add some ten to his list, waifs from the rest of the village
                  societies, and was encouraged to hope for several more of the regular Bohemians of
                  Sunday Schools, children who are the despair of superintendents and the plague of
                  parsons, always ready to enlist where the libraries are new, festivals, pic-nics
                  or clothing supplies in prospect, and quite as sure to desert as" soon as the
                  inducement is obtained. They are the "bounty-jumpers" of the Sunday School army.
                  Maurice found that these last questioned him rather keenly about the new books,
                  and if there would be a Christmas-tree, and volunteered a deal of information
                  about the usages of other Sunday Schools which, had he been one whit more
                  experienced, would have put him on his guard. He picked up one precious bit of
                  information; however which, <emph>did</emph> initiate him somewhat. One clay, or
                  rather one evening he was walking away from the Post Office toward the Railway
                  Station", when he met a couple of little girls somewhere between the ages of eight
                  and twelve. He heard one of them say as he passed, "That's the new minister up to
                  the Universalists." A few steps further on he put his hand into his overcoat
                  pocket and found a letter he had forgotten to post. He returned on his steps and
                  came up with the two damsels just in the shadiest part of Carleton Street. They
                  were talking very earnestly and quite loudly, as the wont of such is, and he
                  "could not choose but hear." "Then says I to her, Ann Maria, I'm not going to your
                  Sunday-School any more, and Susy Blake and Lou 'Porter and they all said they
                  wasn't going, and then she said she was going to have a prize if she brought more
                  scholars than any other girl in her class. And then we said—'What was it and she
                  said it was a Bible, only she wished it was a fan, and she meant to change it at
                  the store for a fan and half a dollar, and then we said we'd all go if she'd spend
                  the half-dollar for candy and give it to us, and she said she would, and then we
                  all went the very next Sunday, and then only think when she got the prize she
                  wouldn't change it—she said her mother had took and locked it up and would only
                  let her have it Sundays to take to meeting, and just as soon as they have their
                  pic-nic I'm going to leave and go to some other school. It was real mean of her,
                  and just as soon as I get hold of that Bible I'll."——Here the sound of Maurice's
                  footsteps startled the speaker into silence.</p>
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7264-00000098"/>
               <p>However, the next Sunday there was a pretty good show of scholars, and Maurice was
                  busy taking the names and then distributing into classes among his young
                  ladies—which, though he was not aware of it, he managed so as to give plenty of
                  jealous heart-burning to the young maidens who were all unused to submit to
                  clerical authority. Then he tried to have a general lesson, which did not turn out
                  very brilliantly, as he was all unused to that most difficult of works—talking to
                  children, and had really nothing in particular to say. So, to cover his retreat,
                  he gave out a hymn which being familiar to these little ones in other schools they
                  joined in with plenty of noise if not of time and tune; but wound up with a
                  doxology which was heartily sung just at the close of the school when the
                  congregation were beginning to enter the building. This was both to the
                  astonishment and horror of one or two who then and there secretly registered a vow
                  against the Sunday School. Then the pretty new books in red and blue covers were
                  given out, Maurice having to act as librarian himself, in his haste and
                  nervousness giving out many more than he put down—the young man whom he had
                  selected for that duty having taken the day, which was fine, for a drive to the
                  next town. The congregation were also kept waiting, and Maurice went into his
                  pulpit in a. much less assured manner than usual. Moreover the rustling of leaves
                  out him out several times during his sermon.</p>
               <p>The next day however came the worst consequence. He was sitting in his room which
                  he had fitted up very comfortably as a parlor and study, and Winthrop had just
                  come in to call upon him, rather formally it must be confessed—when there was a
                  knock at the door. Two ladies entered, the very rustle of whose garments betokened
                  suppressed indignation. The elder of the two, who wore a manifest "front,"
                  introduced herself, saying, "I am Mrs. Abbott and this is Mrs. Tyler, our pastor's
                  wife." Maurice tried to do the honors by presenting Winthrop, when there came a
                  sudden outburst of the bottled wrath." "Oh I'm glad to have Mr. Winthrop here—the
                  new 'piscopal minister, I s'pose. I've known Dr. Donne these twenty years, and
                     <emph>he</emph> never countenanced no such doings. <emph>He</emph> never
                  allowed no such meanness as his teachers to go round gettin' away other people's
                  Sunday scholars." Maurice colored up a little, but Winthrop met the attack. "If
                  you mean to allude to Susan Prince—she was in the Sunday School of St. Jude's when
                  I first came here. Her mother took her away—because she said she would not have
                  her child in the same class with the poor children, and Susan was so distressed at
                  it that now the Jones family have left Norowam, Mrs. Prince herself came to me and
                  begged that Susan might come back. She is the only scholar in St. Jude's whom I
                  know of, that has been in any other school since I had charge of it. Is yours the
                  Methodist or Baptist, Mrs. Abbott?" The good lady answered very curtly with an
                  indignant sniff—"You've taken the child away from where she was gettin' religion,
                  to where there ain't no vital piety, only forms, forms, forms, and you'll have to
                  answer for her soul some day." "But that has nothing to do with the meanness, as
                  you call it. If there has been any 'getting away,' it was on the part of those who
                  went to Mrs. Prince and told her that the Jones children were not fit company for
                  her child." "Our pastor's wife" here suddenly let clown her veil. "I will not
                  say," said Winthrop, "that untrue stories were told, nor (with a slight rhetorical
                  confusion for which we must pardon him) who told them, but there has been no
                  interference, at the same time I know that the same jacket and trowsers have been
                  offered to five different Ai others in my congregation if their boys would leave
                  St. Jude's and come to your Sunday School." Maurice thought the enemy repulsed and
                  ventured into the fight. "What have <emph>I</emph> done?" he asked. "What no
                  gentleman and no Christian—though I don't call Universalists Christians—would do;
                  going round and coaxing Sunday-scholars away, and then giving them Unitarian books
                  to read, and to take them home to their families." "But I assure you," said Bryan,
                  "I have done nothing of the sort. I never asked any children to come who said they
                  went anywhere else—on the contrary, I forbade two to come." "Didn't I see myself,
                  them two Collinses coming out of your meeting-house this very last Sabbath
                  morning?—I'd like to know if the man means to face me out of my eyesight."
                  Winthrop laughed aloud. "Come, come, Mrs. Abbott, you mustn't make any account of
                  Sam and Sally Collins; you know they have gone uninvited to every Sunday School in
                  Norowam. Mr. Maurice is rather new<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7264-00000099"/>
                  here—but <emph>you</emph> know how they can lie. I don't think we shall any of us
                  complain if he can do them some good." "He won't do them good by teaching them to
                  deny their Saviour and giving them Unitarian books round."</p>
               <p>After much trouble the matter was sifted from all irrelevant issues, and the real
                  grievance came to light. It was that the aforesaid Sally Collins, 'a born limb' as
                  the matron called her, had induced the youngest Abbott to the new Sunday School,
                  instead of going where she belonged, and that Maurice had in utter unconsciousness
                  given to her, the daughter of an ex-Methodist minister, a book on the title-page
                  of which was the imprint: "Published by the American Unitarian Association." This
                  book woefully soiled and torn was slapped indignantly down on Maurice's table.
                  "Well, madam," said he, very blandly but not without inward heat, "what must I do
                  to atone for my involuntary trespass?" "I know what you'd better do—and that is,
                  give up trying for a Sabbath School, for according to what my Ruth Jane says, you
                  don't make much out of it. She never see such order, Miss Tyler, in all her born
                  days she says; but I s'pose you'll hardly do that. But if you'll write a note to
                  Brother Tyler and say that you are very sorry and that it sha'n't happen again,
                  why, he's a Christian spirited man, and he'll forgive you." Maurice was gifted
                  with a coolness which in moments of intense provocation stood his friend. He was
                  determined to match her impudence, and with a most winning civility of manner he
                  replied: "I think, that would hardly atone for all my faults—but this I trust will
                  do. If you and your husband will take a pew in my church, I will try to get a
                  class for you to teach, and nobody, not even Mr. Winthrop here, shall get your
                  scholars away."</p>
               <p>She stood as. if stupefied a moment and then turned and walked straight out of the
                  door, never looking to the right or left. The pastor's wife followed her, turning
                  however as she made her exit with a meek, "Good morning, gentlemen. Winthrop threw
                  himself upon Maurice's sofa in a fit of laughter. When he could command his voice
                  he said: "Mr. Maurice, I happen to know that you have behaved very fairly and
                  honorably in this matter, and one thing I came in for this morning was to thank
                  you for it. As for that old tabby; don't worry yourself. I wish she had asked
                     <emph>me</emph> to apologize. But you and I, whatever we may differ upon, will
                  I'm sure always be gentlemen to one another." Maurice smoothed the ruffled plumes
                  of his temper and soon they were chatting very pleasantly, concerning common
                  friends in Boston and Europe where Winthrop had spent some years as a boy. It was
                  the beginning of a warm friendship between the two.</p>
               <p>"It never rains but it pours:" a proverb meteorologically false, but morally
                  justified. Winthrop had hardly gone when Ralston appeared. Maurice was in a
                  belligerent mood, and braced himself for a renewal of the fight on more equal
                  terms. He was not surprised at his visitor's beginning with desultory
                  conversation, for he knew that peculiarly feline way in which Puritanism trains
                  its clergy, of making a sudden spring upon their victims. However he was none the
                  less taken by surprise, when Ralston said as if the thought had just come into his
                  head: "Ah! by the way, Mr. Maurice, you expressed yourself quite strongly—not,
                  eh—stronger than I liked—upon the subject of Christian unity. I thought that
                  perhaps you would not object to a practical test. I, eh, came to propose to you
                  that you should join some of us in a plan for a Young Men's Christian Association.
                  The management will, I believe that is customary, be confined to members of the
                  first church in Norowam and such evangelical bodies as are in fellowship with us:
                  but all other sects are invited to join, and will be entitled to all its benefits
                  including the Reading Room. If you and the young men of your society who bear a
                  good moral character would like to join in it, we shall be delighted to have
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Let me see," said Maurice, "we are to have no part in the management. Could we
                  introduce into the Reading Room Universalist or Unitarian newspapers or
                  magazines?" "Well, eh, no—that is, the committee on that subject must
                  approve—but—I'll tell you what will be better than to bring in a bone of
                  controversy—you might bring in any secular papers you liked. There is some talk of
                  having a good scientific journal or farmer's paper—your, society might donate
                  that. There is for instance the New England Naturalist—it is a trifle, a very
                  trifle more costly than some other secular papers—but very valuable. It is edited
                  by a friend of mine, and I <emph>know</emph> it to be a good thing.<pb n="198-199"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000100"/> We <emph>would</emph> put it on the list, of the
                  Society's own subscriptions, but it was thought best to confine that to religious
                  papers approved by the management." "Ah"—said Maurice—"I suppose the non-voting
                  members subscribe our proportion to the funds of the Society." "Oh yes—a mere
                  trifle—you have the use of all the things which they are used for—Reading Room,
                  fire, lights, etc.; and by the way—we have thought it a good plan in order to
                  encourage membership, to make this regulation, That after twenty members of any
                  denomination have subscribed, all the rest from that church come in free—that
                  admits the poor you know—who might feel a delicacy——Well, what do you think of it?
                  I should be delighted to show you that we are liberal, and that there are places
                  where all professing Christians can meet and join in a common enterprise."</p>
               <p>It did Maurice's self-possession great credit that he never changed countenance
                  for a second—but replied with perfect blandness—"I think your plan admirable, and
                  I shall be delighted to take part in it." The other had evidently expected quite
                  another reception of his proposal—for he looked particularly blank for a
                  moment—then gave a sharp side glance to see if Maurice was in earnest or in irony.
                  The countenance of the Unitarian remained undecipherable. "When is your next
                  meeting?" he continued. "Oh, yes—yes—I forgot that. Thursday night—half-past
                  seven. Good-day"—and the Congregationalist bustled off—partly pleased and partly
                  puzzled. "I think he must be coming over," he said—"really I don't see why he
                  shouldn't, he is quite as orthodox as half of our men—only I am afraid he will
                  shift into Episcopacy. I must keep him out of the hands of Winthrop and Dr.
                  Donne—he had better stay where he is than go to them."</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the subject of these plans was standing looking at the closed door as if
                  following in visionary sight the departing guest whose steps died away in the
                  corridor. Then he sat down and said to himself—having the bad habit of thinking
                  aloud—"Let me see. <emph>We</emph> are to hold no offices and cast no votes.
                     <emph>We</emph> are not to have our own newspapers or magazines.
                     <emph>We</emph> are to pay for an expensive and I dare say stupid paper,
                  because Ralston wants to get it taken. We are to bear in addition our full
                  proportion of the burden of the expense. <emph>We</emph> cannot get more than
                  twenty names at the most, while the thirty or forty Congregationalists will come
                  in at half-price. It is a very admirable scheme——for somebody. I will help it all
                  I can."</p>
               <p>He took up the printed copy of the Constitution which Ralston had left. It was a
                  diplomatically worded document, which had come into being through much
                  tribulation. The managers had wished to put in something against Bishops, but the
                  Methodist Minister unexpectedly, but firmly stood out, so they were reluctantly
                  compelled to omit everything which could make the Episcopalians ineligible—for
                  office and voting. They consoled themselves with thinking that they would always
                  be in a small minority, since neither Dr. Donne nor Winthrop approved,—but that
                  was not half so nice as to keep them out entirely by a dexterous use of words, and
                  then to throw the onus of refusing Christian fellowship upon "High Church
                  Bigotry." They had to strike out the word "baptized," because the Baptist minister
                  signified his intention of challenging every one not immersed by a duly immersed
                  Baptist. So the Second Article read as follows—"Every professing Christian, a
                  believer in the Holy Trinity, who is in good standing with his own religious body,
                  may become a member upon signing the Constitution and paying two dollars annual
                  subscription—and all such members shall vote and be eligible to office. Any others
                  of good moral character upon the same terms may become members, except as regards
                  voting and holding office."</p>
               <p>Maurice read this through attentively, then read it aloud, checking off each
                  clause as he did so upon his fingers. Then a queer, quizzical smile broke out over
                  his face, and he got up and went out, and in another minute was knocking at the
                  door of another room in the hotel. A young man of his own age admitted him. He was
                  clothed in rusty black with a very long skirted coat and very narrow strip of
                  white linen closely clasping his throat. His blue eye and rather irregularly
                  shaped head, which the close cropped hair fully displayed, betoken that Celtic
                  origin which a slight accent fully confirmed. He looked both astonished and
                  pleased at Maurice's call. When the object of it was proposed to him hp looked
                  perplexed, but finally seemed to comprehend, and at last with all the glee of a
                     school-boy<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7264-00000101"/> slapped his hand on the
                  table, exclaiming, "'m with ye!—I'm with ye! I'll just speak to the Father; that's
                  my superior ye know, and we'll have as many of the boys as ye want. Two hundred ye
                  as will do ye. I could get ye four—but two will do. Could they make their marks do
                  ye think in signing the Constitution? No, I'm afraid that wouldn't go—but a
                  hundred can sign. And now can I offer ye anything—it's early in the day—but if
                  ye'd like it's only ringing the bell—if ye'd like to smoke or a drop of something
                  in the punch-line."—"No, thank you," said Maurice, "there is a clause in
                     <emph>our</emph> Constitution about the use of intoxicating liquors and tobacco
                  that we must not forger." "Oh, murder! and is it the drink and the pipe that ye
                  object to? We'll well—it doesn't signify; it's only putting the boys under a vow
                  for a day—and then we'll have the Constitution put to rights ye know."</p>
               <p>Maurice was punctual at the meeting on Thursday night. There were some four or
                  five of his own society there. Winthrop declined to join, but laughed when he
                  heard Maurice's plans. The other ministers of the place, except Dr. Donne, were
                  there. The young Irishman sat quietly by Maurices's side. Wondering looks were
                  cast at both, and whispered questions and surmises passed to and fro, amid the
                  little group of managers around the president's table. The subject of most of
                  these comments sat still, merely measuring the room with his eye, as if inwardly
                  picking out places for the introduction of a few highly colored prints of a
                  devotional cast in which the room was rather lacking. Presently the President
                  stepped into his place and rapped for order. About fifteen members present beside
                  the non-voters took their places. "Brother Kendrick," said he, "will you—it is
                  your turn, I believe—lead in prayer?" "No, it is Brother Tyler's turn," was the
                  answer. "I have a bad cold," said Brother Tyler, who was affronted at not having
                  been asked at the first meeting.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps Brother Ralston had better." After a little amicable wrangle over the
                  matter, the President nothing loth, yielded to some one's suggestion that he
                  should open the meeting, and being a Methodist class-leader, was ready to stir up
                  the gift that was in him. Some stood, some knelt. The Irishman turned his back,
                  crossed himself, and pulled out his little Book of Hours. Maurice remained sitting
                  with his head upon his hands. He was edified by hearing his own conversion prayed
                  for in everything but by name, and Winthrop who was not there by his name in terms
                  so coarsely offensive the middle of it and walked deliberately our.</p>
               <p>When the prayer was over the secretary was called for the names of new members.
                  Ralston looked anxiously at his watch. Maurice rose and announced his own name and
                  those of the five others whom he had brought, who desired to be admitted as
                  non-voting members. These were voted the young Irishman arose. "I would like to
                  ask question. Do ye receive as members all who sign the Constitution and pay the
                  fees?" "Certainly, if they are within its provisions—believers in the Trinity, and
                  in good standing with their own denomination." "They must be of an Evangelical
                  denomination," said Ralston. "No," said Brother Tyler who always opposed Ralston.
                  "No," said Brother Tyler who always opposed Ralston on principle, "no, that word
                  was stricken out at the first meeting," and the objector put his finger on the
                  printed page. There was a rustling of leaves, but the fact was apparent. There had
                  been a hope of getting Winthrop to join with the Episcopalians, and Ralston
                  himself having been defeated in his attempt to introduce the anti-prelatical
                  clause had suddenly changed front and insisted upon the most comprehensive terms.
                  So the word had been stricken out. One or two began to feel what was impending. "I
                  wish then," said the Celt, "to announce as members of this society, voting
                  members, meself, the Rev. John Moriaty, deacon of the Church of St. Francis
                  Xavier, and the following others, Patrick McGuinness, Bernard Sweeny, Patrick
                  Blake, Murphy O'Brien," and so he went on reading out in a stentorian voice the
                  terrible roll which seemed interminable, of more than an hundred names. As he
                  concluded he laid the list upon the secretary's table, saying, "An' every one of
                  them I can answer for that he's in good standing in his own churruch—indade unless
                  it is little O'Reilly, that was suspended for ating meat the last Friday that ever
                  was." There was a dead silence which was broken by the timid voice of a member,
                  one of those unlucky men who are always suggesting with the best intent the very
                  thing which ought to be kept in<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7264-00000102"/> the
                  shade. I believe, Mr. President, that we have a clause in the by-laws which allows
                  absent members to vote by proxy when unavoidably absent. I hope Brother Moriaty
                  will not insist upon this privilege which would give him a majority of the votes."
                  Maurice had not seen the by-laws. He bit his lip to keep from laughing. Some of
                  the others turned white with vexation and dismay. Ralston reddened up to his
                  forehead; for he had engineered that very clause for the sake of keeping the
                  control in his own society. He sprang to his feet to object. "Not, Mr. President,
                  till they have paid their subscription—not till they have all paid." "Is that it,"
                  said Moriaty, pulling out a huge roll of bills, "then I have it here, two hundred
                  and twenty." Maurice had not told him of the arrangement by which the additional
                  members over twenty were to come in free. "It is not already paid," said Ralston,
                  "it is the payment, not the production of the money, that makes the essence of
                  membership. These bills may not be good, or never reach us, for all that we know."
                  There was an ominous light came for a moment in the Irishman's eye, but presently
                  the same mischievous twinkle returned. "And whom would I pay it to? Didn't I hear
                  Mr. Secretary read that ye couldn't agree at the last meeting upon any one for
                  treasurer? Now maybe as I'll be chosen meself to that responsible office the
                  night, why would I be after taking the money out of my pocket with the one hand
                  and putting it back with the t'other? Maybe, as the honorable and riverent member
                  insinuates, I'd not be finding <emph>all</emph> the same good bills again." This
                  last was said with an impudent wink at Ralston. "But I won't press the point;
                  there's a heap of the boys at the street corner, and I'll just step out and bring
                  them up to do their own voting, and then my modesty needn't suffer from voting my
                  own name an hundred and ten times. I conclude no one will be so ungentlemanly as
                  to propose to vote for treasurer while I'm out. I'll not be many minutes." And he
                  went out of the door. For the moment the Society sat stupefied. If he returned it
                  would be to vote the whole thing into a Sodality of St. Francis Xavier. Ralston's
                  ready wit rose to the emergency. "I move you, Mr. President, the expulsion of the
                  following members," said he, "for notorious evil life and conversation, the Rev.
                  John Moriaty, &amp;c., &amp;c., the names contained in the list on my table." The
                  motion was hurriedly seconded, when the same timid marplot spoke once more. "I
                  believe, I think, yes I'm sure that by our by-laws each member's case must be
                  acted on separately and after a week's notice in writing, with opportunity to
                  appear and answer charges." And then awful silence fell upon them, and looks were
                  cast at the unlucky speaker as if they would have gladly offered him up as "a
                  burnt sacrifice to Christian unity." "I move to suspend the by-laws." "Second the
                  motion," cried Ralston and another. The objector tried to speak, having found that
                  no motion to suspend was in order unless unanimous, and though he most earnestly
                  wished for the success of Ralston's plan and had begun to enter into it, he
                  thought some member <emph>might</emph> like to oppose, and in his
                  conscientiousness felt it was right to give the chance. His voice was drowned in a
                  yell of "question! question!" And the chairman declaring it the unanimous wish of
                  the society proceeded in hottest haste to put the next motion. Steps were-heard
                  upon the stairs without—heavy steps, which might be Hibernian and possibly
                  bacchanalian. There was no time to spare, a shout of "aye" recorded the expulsion
                  of the one hundred, and then Ralston, wholly himself, and not at all dismayed at
                  the prospect of a row even, moved an adjournment. "Without prayer?" asked the
                  "infant terrible" of the evening, "and the singing of a hymn?"
                  "Yes—yes—you—you"—Ralston did not say what, but choked down a tolerably strong and
                  uncomplimentary title. "Come over to my lecture-room for an informal meeting, and
                  sing as many hymns as you please." And so amid pulling on of great coats and
                  turning out of gas the adjournment was put and carried, just as the steps were
                  heard at the door. Three men entered, quiet, honest, sober farmers of the
                  Congregational Society, voters whom Ralston had enjoined to be sure and be on hand
                  to carry the election of treasurer. "What you ain't a going <emph>yet</emph>—be
                  ye?" said the foremost, "what's the matter—town ain't afire is it—nor nothin'?"
                  "Were there many of them?—many Irishmen?—when are they coming up?" cried several
                  breathless and agitated voices. "Irishmen! no, nor Dutchmen, nor anybody else—what
                  ye're talkin' about?" Everybody was in too much of a hurry to listen, and the
                  meeting poured into the outer air surprised enough<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000103"/> to find the streets silent and deserted. The
                  terrible Irishmen might be in a lurking-place round about, however, and the
                  impetus did not stop till Ralston had them safely housed in his own lecture-room,
                  save one or two, who, because of old feuds, would not, and others who fled till
                  they reached their own doors.</p>
               <p>Maurice did not follow, nor was he ever afterwards asked to attend or to pay his
                  subscription. The subsequent proceedings of the Young Men's Christian Union were
                  not again disturbed by the Rev. John Moriaty; and the amended constitution
                  contained by unanimous consent this special clause, "not being Roman, Catholics,"
                  added to the conditions of membership. When Ralston next met Maurice in private,
                  he had the good sense to laugh over the whole matter. "That was your doing, I
                  suspect' he said. "You beat me fairly—but say nothing about it, and I will not;
                  and if you like, I will have matters so arranged as to give you full membership."
                  "No, I thank you' said Maurice; "but I will not speak of the matter again, and
                  Moriaty is going back to New York next week. How does the Christian Union get on?"
                  "Oh, pretty well—but the Baptists have left and set up the Young Men's Christian
                  League, and there are but three Presbyterians who never attend, so that the
                  Methodists and we of the First Church have it all our own way. There may be some
                  collision; you know they are fond of setting up their distinctive usages, and
                  really I wish you would get Winthrop and a few good fellows and come in. I'd like
                  to have a little chanting practiced. I don't mean, you know, those stupid old
                  Cathedral humbugs, but some of a new arrangement I want to see introduced into
                  public worship. The fact is, I never intended this for just a perpetual Methodist
                  prayer-meeting. Come now, and we'll vote those fellows into their places and keep
                  them there, and then divide the offices."</p>
               <p>"Et dona ferentes," said Maurice, meaningly. "I think on the whole I have
                  conscientious scruples about joining with a semi-prelatical body like the
                  Methodists." Ralston took it good-humoredly, and when the Union died out, as it
                  did in six months, could not help telling the story himself.</p>
               <p>He was an honest and Christian man in his way, but he had been educated into a
                  morality in religious politics not unworthy of Liguori. It is the result of that
                  utter absorption tion of religion into a pure technicality and formalism, which is
                  the proper sequence of an attempt at a bodiless spirituality. This is the cardinal
                  mischief of New-England puritanism.</p>
               <p>After this adventure, however, Ralston took to Maurice exceedingly, and was often
                  in his room. Perhaps it is anticipating matters a little to give one conversation,
                  but it had some bearing on Maurice's future.</p>
               <p>"Where are you going?" he said to Maurice, rather abruptly, one hot afternoon as
                  he was lying on Bryan's sofa. "Going? nowhere at present—when do you mean?" "When
                  you leave the Universalists—you are going somewhere. In the first place you are
                  not satisfied, any one can see that, and then you ought not to be."</p>
               <p>"Never mind about the being dissatisfied," said Maurice, without looking up, for
                  he had an uneasy feeling to the same effect—"tell me where I ought to go."
                  "Anywhere would be a change for the better." "That does not answer my question;
                  when I start, I propose to go to the very best of all; if one must journey, it is
                  wisest to have it pay." "Oh, the very best of all is the Independent
                  Congregational system of New-England, if that is all you want, of course." "Well,
                  Ralston, you of course can tell me what that is, and you said the other day that
                  you did not know where there was one of your brethren who agreed with you. Now we
                  can't be both pastors of the First Church in Norowam, and if I were to be your
                  colleague, the salary would hardly keep both, I think." "Come, now," said Ralston,
                  "haven't you been thinking of St. Jude's, or something like it, eh?" "Suppose I
                  have, what would you say?" "I don't know, if you have been bitten by the Puseyites
                  (and they are worse than the mosquitoes on Norowam marshes) it is of no use to say
                  anything, and I have seen a feint hankering after our Medival friend Winthrop, so
                  I am fencing to find out. I don't like to waste powder." "Consider me unbitten,
                  and out with it." "Very well, then, I will, and risk it," and Ralston rose up a
                  little, and, leaning upon his elbow, began with his eyes intently fixed upon the
                  face of the other—"I will tell you, you are ambitious. You have ability and you
                  know it. 'Great let me call him for he conquered me" he added, with a laugh. "Now
                  there is no chance for you in the Episcopal Church—no such chance as you want.<pb
                     n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7264-00000104"/> They used to say of the old Democratic
                  party in Massachusetts, that they kept it conveniently small so as to divide the
                  federal offices. The men who rule the Episcopal Church are very much of the same
                  way of thinking. If it gets too large and too active, they will go to the wall,
                  and they know it. They are the men who <emph>rule</emph> that Church, not the
                  Bishops, but the men who make Bishops; they are not all the clergy by any means,
                  but you see they manage matters by dint of keeping well together and snubbing all
                  attempts to be independent. The few who are most able and successful laugh at
                  them; the great hard-working body of their clergy are too busy to note them, and
                  the drones and the inefficient toady to them. We who are on the outside see that.
                  I tell you I haven't been into the Bible Society and such places for nothing."
                  "But isn't it an ecclesiastical vice? isn't it so in all religious bodies?" "Of
                  course it is, but it doesn't work smoothly elsewhere as in the Episcopal Church.
                  You see the leaders, have the whip-hand. There are some of them who know how to
                  get a young man out of a parish, and How to keep him out of, another, and never
                  does he know why." "But I thought the Bishops were to correct just that." "Pooh,
                  pooh, I don't believe as yet in the Apostolic succession, and that there is
                  inherent wisdom in the hollow of a mitre. The Bishops have too much to do, to see
                  what is going on under their noses. I'll tell you frankly, but you mustn't repeat
                  it, for I would not say it to Winthrop for a good deal, that thing, and perhaps
                  some other reasons, have just kept me out of the Episcopal Church. Even their best
                  men chafe at the tyranny of these dead and fossilized conservatives who always are
                  remembering the good old times of some departed Bishop, and who, I dare say, when
                  Seabury first came over, sighed for the conservative times when men had to go to
                  London to get their orders."</p>
               <p>Maurice in his turn, rose up upon his elbow and looked from the other couch full
                  in the face of Ralston. "Never mind me, only I say to you '<emph>wait.</emph>'
                  This very thing keeps a good many of our men out. You don't suppose that we, that
                  is the majority of us, <emph>believe</emph> in the old fiction of Independency? no
                  more do we in the Tractarianism about Apostolic Succession; but we are waiting to
                  see which system is going to work the best. Twenty years hence, there will be a
                  rush of our men to the old Mother Church." "But why?" said Maurice. "Well," said
                  Ralston, blushing a little, "you'll find out soon enough—it is, I don't mind
                  telling you, the laity. We cannot control them. The Churchmen can—" "Is not that
                  because of this past influence? They are behind the times." "So I say out of
                  doors, but to tell you the truth, they, are not. They are in advance of our laity.
                  And if it were not for our Churches they would be far more under their pastor's
                  control. We die hard," continued he with a touch of the old spirit of his ancestry
                  rising up in him, "and every inch of ground they get here, they must fight
                  for."</p>
               <p>"You are a queer mixture," said Maurice, wonderingly. "Well, I am that," replied
                  the other complacently, "but it is a proof of my excellent disposition that I am
                  giving you such sound advice. I can't say to you 'come to us' and I
                     <emph>won't</emph> say go to them, and to tell the truth I hardly know what to
                  say. You were not born either Presbyterian or Dutchman, and those highly
                  respectable sects are not open to you."</p>
               <p>"What do you think of my Broad Church Unitarian views? isn't that to be the thing
                  after all?" Ralston burst into a hearty laugh. "Excuse me, Maurice, but that is
                  too rich. I don't think the Great Eastern will carry the Atlantic Cable, but I
                  should hardly propose as a substitute a Brooklyn ferry-boat. <emph>Your</emph>
                  Broad Church' would be swamped in an instant, whenever it attempted a real piece
                  of work. It is good to take passengers from the puritan city of Beecher to the
                  Episcopal Metropolis where Trinity predominates over Wall street, perhaps to bring
                  them back again; but excuse me from an Atlantic voyage in it. No, wait and see
                  what will turn up, and meanwhile, as the gong has begun to sound, let us get on
                  our coats and go to tea."</p>
               <p>There had been more or less of epidemic disease hanging about Norowam. A drought
                  in summer had been followed by warm, sultry days and then by a sudden chill with
                  sea fogs and the raw easterly airs. Maurice noticed that Win-throp's handsome face
                  looked very grave as he came to his meals, that the ate them hurriedly and was
                  soon off.</p>
               <p>Maurice hesitated to ask the cause, but another of the hotel boarders called out
                  across the table at dinner, "Many<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7264-00000105"/> sick
                  in the parish, Mr. Winthrop?" "Several very sick' was the answer. "Keeps you
                  pretty busy, eh?" The young clergyman only nodded assent. "What is the matter?"
                  asked Maurice in a lower tone. "Oh this horrible dysentery. It is the most
                  treacherous thing we have, worse than typhoid, I think—except scarlet fever among
                  the children, there is nothing I dread so much." "Well, but do you have to go
                  where it is?" said Maurice. The other looked at him with open eyes. "Go! why to be
                  sure. I was not speaking of myself when I said I dreaded it, in fact I haven't
                  thought of that—it is in the parish that I dread it." "Why," said the other who
                  had put the first question, "won't dysentery kill you parsons as quick as it will
                  the rest of us?"</p>
               <p>The young man smiled slightly and then said, "The killing is not in the account.
                  We have something else to think of. I have not found ever in my short experience
                  that men live longest who are most afraid of dying. When I first began to go about
                  among the sick, one of the Doctors told me not to suppose that anything could kill
                  me—and then half the danger was over. So I have just acted on that principle ever
                  since—that is not to worry about myself at all, which comes to the same end."</p>
               <p>Maurice looked at him with admiration—there was a young man, his junior in years,
                  certainly in attainments, for Winthrop had not concealed the respect he felt for
                  Bryan's culture, and probably by no means his equal in ability, going about his
                  work in a cheery, whole-hearted way which he felt was far beyond his own mark. He
                  was destined to see something more of that before the day ended.</p>
               <p>In the hall of the hotel a woman met them, apparently in great agitation. She had
                  been waiting there quietly enough—but when she saw them, she threw herself, as
                  women can, especially among the poor, into an immediate excitement. "Oh Mr.
                  Winthrop—Mr. Winthrop—Jake is took very sick indeed and we don't expect him to
                  live the night out—you never see anybody so strangely handled." "What is the
                  matter, dysentery?" "No, the Doctors don't know what to make of it. Can't you come
                  right away?" "Where do you live?"</p>
               <p>"Oh the old place where you baptized the baby, the fourth house, just this side of
                  the big elm on the Ponacus point road." "I can't come just yet. I must, see Mrs.
                  Peters and a sick child at the Merills, but I'll be down about five, perhaps."</p>
               <p>"Can't ye come no earlier? Well you'll give me half a dollar to buy some medicine,
                  won't ye?" "I will leave an order at the druggist's—Thompson's to let you have
                  what you need, upon any other doctor's prescription. You know I can't give you
                  money, Mrs. Blake."</p>
               <p>He passed out, followed by the woman who gave a wishful look toward the bar-room,
                  and then relapsed into stolid quiet. Winthrop crossed over with Maurice to the
                  Post Office. "Did you hear me settle that Mrs. Blake?" he said, "I will just tell
                  you—not to let her get any money out of you. I know her like a book—her scamp of a
                  son has eaten too many clams and got the colic, I suppose, however I must go
                  though I hate taking the long tramp for nothing."</p>
               <p>Just then they met Mr. Graham who entered the office and hurried up to the clerk's
                  window. "Nothing in my box? is the afternoon mail from the city in?" "Yes, sir."
                  "And nothing in it for me?" "Nothing for you, sir." "Then I must stop up to-night,
                  and wait till the eleven down to-morrow morning—confound it. Ah—Mr. Maurice is
                  that you? How are you, sir—how are you getting on?" Maurice caught Mr. Graham's
                  breath as he spoke: it was fearfully bad. His eyes were bloodshot and his face and
                  manner feverish. He paused for no answer—but went on talking, "I've got to stop up
                  to-night at the House or the point, there was a letter to meet me here, and I came
                  up this morning to look after the place—expecting to go down this Afternoon—and
                  plague take it—I must wait for it. I feel sick, too," "How did you leave Mrs. and
                  Miss Graham?" "Oh they are all right, thank you—haven't returned yet from
                  Philadelphia. Well—well—I must make the best of it. Here Joseph, you'll have to
                  take me back again—and see here, stop at Snowfield's and got something, a chop or
                  a steak, for supper and breakfast to-morrow. That's the young Episcopal curate who
                  came in with you—is it eh? The fellow they are building the chapel up in the
                  fields for!" he added looking after Winthrop who went swinging up the street in a
                  sort of abstracted way he had.<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7264-00000106"/> "Well he
                  don't look like one to put your nose out of joint—rather a Miss-Nancy I guess. I
                  won't ask you to come and stop with me, to-night, I'm likely to be poor company.
                  Good-day—good-day."</p>
               <p>Maurice could not help noticing the change in Graham's manner. Usually very quiet
                  and polished, he was now boisterous and abrupt, and his usual reticent dignity all
                  gone.</p>
               <p>However, he thought no more of it, but went out to call upon one of the young
                  ladies of his flock. She was not at home, and so feeling the chilliness of the
                  afternoon, Maurice returned to his room, had a fire kindled in his air-tight, and
                  with a volume of Carlyle—the Past and Present, he sate down to pass the evening in
                  comfort. A partly finished sermon lay upon the table. He thought about nine he
                  should feel in the mood for writing—perhaps might finish it by midnight. He could
                  not tell—he was not driven—he felt a little weariness of his work—a little
                  distaste of the oft recurring task. He was in doubt what to say. He had made a
                  most satisfactory opening, but an unlucky sentence had crowded him to the border
                  of positive teaching. He was so far of a truthful temper of thought, that he could
                  not turn aside from a perceived conclusion and take refuge in platitudes. He
                  lacked as yet that fatal facility of the pulpit. So he waited for inspiration and
                  meanwhile found it pleasanter to dream over the heroism of the medival monk, than
                  to plunge into unknown and perhaps dangerous ways. So he lounged back in his most
                  comfortable chair after tea with his feet half in, half out of slippers, reading
                  in a lazy content as he listened to the rush of the wind by the house, and the
                  occasional dash of rain upon his carefully curtained window. There came a knock at
                  his door. "Come in!" he called without rising, supposing it to be the waiter with
                  letters from the Post or firewood for the stove. The door opened and Mr. Graham's
                  man, in a rough great-coat on which the water glistened, stood there. "Mr.
                  Maurice, Mr. Graham is very sick indeed—I've just sent the Doctor, and then he
                  told me to call for you. I've got the buggy at the door—wants you to come right
                  away." Maurice sprang up in a tremor of excitement and alarm. To do him justice he
                  did not think of contagion, his was the moral fear of a new situation, and the
                  excitement of being summoned to visit the most important parishioner he had upon
                  such an errand. Of course he had no "<title>Clergyman's Companion,</title>" no
                  Rector's <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Vade Mecum</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >Visitatio Infirmorum,</foreign> to take with him. He must carry in his own
                  head and heart whatever was needed. However he constrained himself to appear calm,
                  put on his warmest wraps and storm protections, and followed the impatient Joseph
                  down stairs. A man with a lantern was standing at the head of Mr. Graham's little
                  black mare. She was fretting restlessly, and could hardly be kept still long
                  enough for them to get in. They had no time to draw the Buffalo robe about them,
                  for as soon as she felt the reins draw she was off with a dash into the
                  darkness.</p>
               <p>It was a wild night enough. Most of the shops were already closed, and the lights
                  in the dwellings were obscured by curtains or shutters. The moon was behind the
                  thick clouds, so that the Norowam Gas Company had withholden their light from the
                  street-lamps. The spirited little animal plunged through the mud of the black
                  road. A lightning flash, as they passed St. Jude's, showed the tall spire and
                  tower standing white and ghostlike against the black night, and also showed them
                  the way which branched to the right toward the railroad crossing. Just before they
                  reached it, Joseph pulled up with a suddenness which nearly threw the mare upon
                  her haunches. There was an angry glare of light ahead, and with a rush and roar
                  the Express train swept by them within a few feet of the horse's head. "Lucky I
                  remembered the train when I did," said the man, "we were square into it—but: the
                  wind blew so I never heard it come. There ought to be a gate here, that's a fact."
                  Maurice felt a great shuddering thankfulness take hold upon him. Happily the mare
                  was headed for home, for after this last she would not be controlled, but broke
                  into a run. If she had not known the way well, they would have come to speedy
                  grief. Presently, however, they rose upon a little ascent, and the moon at the
                  same time broke through the driving clouds. They were in front of a square house
                  of dark stone, relieved only by a light verandah painted white. Behind a light or
                  two showed the village. Then came the darkness again, as they turned into the
                  cross-road which led across the salt marshes to Ponacus<pb n="212-213"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000107"/> Point. There was a strange gleam along the fields,
                  which the moon showed them far and wide covered with water. It was the flood-tide
                  of the September equinox. In the lulls of the storm they heard at intervals the
                  distant hollow roar of the surf. Nothing now broke the full force of the dashing
                  sheets of rain which almost blinded them, and presently they heard the splash of
                  the water under them, and the mare's pace perforce slackened to a walk. Whether
                  they were on or off the road they could not tell. "If this is the full sweep of
                  the tide, we're in for it, though I've lived on the point seven years come next
                  May, and never saw the like of this." It was up to the hub of the fore-wheels, but
                  fortunately for them, the stone walls broke its force, and the tide had room to
                  spread over the broad levels. The gallant little Morgan horse pulled through to
                  the rising ground beyond the town, and then shaking herself set off upon a gentle
                  trot Joseph crossed himself. "That is a narrow escape we have had, sir; if we had
                  gone off the road we should have lost the buggy, and maybe drowned the horse. She
                  is too good a little thing to die in a ditch. It's a good rubbing down, and a good
                  feed, and a dry bed she'll have to-night, if I sit up till morning for it. You
                  won't be going back to-night, any way."</p>
               <p>It seemed a long tedious ride to Maurice, yet was not really very far. Presently
                  the darkness ahead grew denser, and he became aware that he had reached the trees
                  of the Graham wood, heavy pines and horse-chestnuts and some noble elms in the
                  avenue. The light of their lantern gleamed upon the posts of the gateway, rough
                  columns, built of small stones set in cement, and terminating a high plastered
                  stone wall. A light shone from the house as they turned into the grounds, and
                  followed the sweep of the carriage-drive. There was a high flight of steps, and
                  then Maurice found himself in a square hall with a heavy balustraded staircase
                  upon the landing-place of which stood a heavy clock in a case of ebony with a full
                  moon shining upon the upper part of its dial-plate. He was shown into a side room,
                  the dining-parlor, where was a blazing fire. He was only too glad to compose
                  himself, and to feel the genial warmth. He found his outer wrappings quite wet.
                  There was a distant sound of groaning which he heard now and then. He could not
                  tell whether it came from the trees outside, or from the room overhead, but he
                  dreaded it might be the latter. Like most young men unused to it, he shrank from
                  the sight of sickness and pain. He tried to think of what he had to do, what he
                  had come there for, but could not clear his thoughts from the confusing monotony
                  of the ticking clock upon the stairs and the beating gusts at the windows. At
                  length there appeared one of the women-servants to say, "Mr. Graham will see you
                  now, sir." At the head of the stairs, outside the sick-room, he met the Doctor.
                  "Be careful about exciting him," said the latter. "There is great cerebral
                  inflammation already; we have been trying opiates, without effect thus far, and
                  unless we can produce rest, it will go hard with him." The face of the physician
                  was a shrewd but kindly one; weather-beaten as one that had faced the storms of a
                  thirty-years' practice, and his keen eye never looked so steadily, and his gray
                  hair cover so resolute a brain as in the crisis of a difficult case. His was the
                  coolness of long and not unsuccessful coping with emergencies. He saw that Maurice
                  was both flurried and reluctant, but, himself a churchman, he was unwilling to
                  turn away from a patient the spiritual aid which was asked, even though he might
                  doubt its efficacy. He laid his hand on Maurice's shoulder: "Keep cool," he said,
                  "and if he gets over-excited, you will excuse me if I interfere." Kindly meant as
                  it was, it overthrew the little self-possession left to the young minister. He
                  entered the sick-room, and luckily did the best thing he could have done, which
                  was to advance to the sick man's side and take his hot hand. The old man, for Mr.
                  Graham was that, a tall, strong-framed and handsome one withal in spite of his
                  years, clung to him with a feverish grasp.</p>
               <p>"Oh you've come; can you do me any good—can you do me any good? The Doctor tells
                  me to be quiet, but I can't be quiet. I am afraid to die. The devil is waiting for
                  my soul outside—there, can't you hear him laugh?" he said, as a wild shuddering
                  sough of wind in the pine-tree tops mingled with the rattling of the casement and
                  the hollow eddying in the wide chimneys. "Oh, I've been an awful sinner. Where's
                  Gertrude? don't let Gertrude in; she mustn't hear. Oh, can't you do anything for
                  me?" Maurice stood perfectly powerless. "You must try to be still," he said at
                  length. "If the medicine will only operate you will not<pb n="214-215"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000108"/> die, and you prevent it from operating." A faint
                  shadow passed over the Physician's face as he stood by the bed-side where he could
                  see but not be seen by the patient. "This is more your case than mine," he said,
                  in a low tone, to Maurice, "you must relieve his mind." "Oh, tell me something to
                  help me, I can't die—I don't know anything about death. You have been preaching to
                  us—Dr. —— there in town has been telling us, that what a man does in his life-time
                  will go on with him. I never did anything in my life except to look out for myself
                  and my family. I wasn't brought up to this thing, but to the old Assembly's
                  catechism and all that. I took to Unitarianism because it was easy going. It may
                  be nice for you ministers to trust to, but when a man like me has nothing of his
                  own, what is to help him? Don't try to tell me, there is no hell, I know better
                  than that; there is, and it is just for such men as me, who have had their easy
                  time in this life." "But you cannot have been such a great sinner," said poor
                  Maurice, at his wit's end. "Much you know about it. Where have I made my money?
                  There's a man on the Guinea coast can tell you. No questions asked, twenty per
                  cent paid down. I tell you that just because I only had to draw my check on the
                  bank for that money and shut my eyes, and let other men manage the business, buy
                  the ship and fit her out and get that devil incarnate Hank Bailey for master, that
                  don't clear me. My money helped do it, there's where it is. Oh me! oh me!" and he
                  rolled about in a fresh access of pain. "And where did I spend it? It is safely
                  invested way down below Lispenard Street, and you can see and smell that money. It
                  smells worse than when it was rotting under the slaver's hatches in the calm off
                  Antigua. That money is buried under the floor of a tenement block, where they have
                  any floor, and it pays twenty per cent, of scarlet-fever and typhus, and the
                  earnings of that too came to me. Do you want to know how I've been spending them?
                  Well, you won't know because I may get well after all, and then it were best not
                  told—you won't know unless you can help me."</p>
               <p>And then, with the strange self-command of sickness which comes between its
                  paroxysms, he said quietly and coldly, "I am talking too much, Doctor, I'm
                  afraid—that opium you have given me, must have got into my brain, I think. Mr.
                  Maurice, if you like to offer a prayer for me—do so." Then a fierce spasm of pain
                  seized him once more; in the midst of it he seemed to gather strength, and looked
                  up almost angrily at Maurice. "<emph>Don't</emph> pray for me," he said, "unless
                  you can pray to some purpose. What can you promise me?" and then he fell to
                  moaning and asking for some one to help him. The Doctor slipped out of the room.
                  Presently he returned; he beckoned to Maurice. "Unless that opium takes effect in
                  half an hour," he whispered, "he won't live the light out. You may think I am
                  taking a great liberty, but I have sent for Mr. Winthrop whom I left just now at
                  the farm-house across the way. I know him in a sick-room, and I think he can give
                  Mr. Graham some comfort; if that can be done he can rest and we shall probably
                  pull him through, and save body and soul both." Maurice was too much relieved to
                  feel offended, and heard with joy the opening of the heavy hall-door and the voice
                  of Winthrop in the passage-way. The young clergyman presently came in, and went
                  straight to the bedside. Graham measured him from head to foot with a single
                  glance, his eye flashing with the wild-fire of fever. "What can I do for you,
                  sir?" said Winthrop, as he stood before him, but the question was not asked in
                  hesitation, but in the assured tone of one ready and willing. "I shall soon see. I
                  have been a great sinner and I want help." "First confess your sins and then
                  repent: 'The blood of the Lord Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin.'" "Do you only
                  say that, or do you mean it?" cried the old man. "I mean it from the bottom of my
                  heart." "Must I confess everything? I am weak and my thoughts wander." "No—answer
                  me my questions—you can specify if you need." And then, sitting on the bed-side,
                  he began with the Commandments, not in form but in substance, giving to each also
                  the spiritual expansion which the New Testament teaching of the Lord has added to
                  the letter. After each he paused, and then asked: "Are you consciously guilty in
                  respect of this or of any part of it?" The sick man could only feebly move his
                  head—exhaustion was fast coming upon him. If the sign was affirmative, the further
                  question was then put: "Do you repent, and do you desire and purpose, God helping
                  you, amendment?"</p>
               <p>Once or twice Winthrop looked anxiously at the Doctor,<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000109"/> but Graham sighed to him to go on, and when it was
                  all through he said faintly but eagerly, "Now pray—pray." "In a moment," replied
                  Winthrop, and then he asked furthermore in the form of questions, the articles of
                  the Creed. Graham assented eagerly. When all was done, he said, raising himself a
                  little in bed, "God alone can forgive sins. Did Jesus Christ, "when on earth,
                  forgive sins?" "Most assuredly He did," answered Winthrop. "Then I believe Him to
                  be God—I will try to believe Him to be my Saviour." Tears were falling freely from
                  Winthrop's eyes. Saying, "Let us pray," he knelt, and holding the sick man by the
                  hand, he uttered those most appropriate and comforting collects Which the
                  Visitation Office provides, together with the one for Trinity Sunday and that of
                  the week. Quiet came over the features of the patient. "Now Doctor," he said, "I
                  can sleep—good night to you both." The young men left the room.</p>
               <p>A servant met them below in the hall, saying, "Gentlemen you must not think of
                  leaving to-night, indeed you could not get through; there is a tremendous tide
                  upon the causeway, and your rooms are ready. Presently the Doctor came down with a
                  cheery look upon his face. He gave Winthrop a hearty shake of the hand. "We'll
                  pull him through yet—at all events your coming has done him so much good, that the
                  chances are fair for him now. He is very weak though." "Call me, Doctor," said
                  Winthrop, "if you think he is sinking in the night; and now I'll go to bed—I'm
                  terribly tired." So off he started. "Tired!" said the Doctor looking after him, "I
                  should think so. He walked down to the Point here just as the storm was coming up,
                  and he has been visiting the sick every hour since he got out of bed this morning.
                  Here—Jane—Margaret, what's your name? Can't you take him up a glass of wine and a
                  biscuit? Stop, I'll have him down, he must have something, and I want something
                  too." So Maurice, who was utterly upset by the excitement and sense of failure,
                  and the near presence of death in the house, could hardly believe his eyes when he
                  saw these two, just now so full of anxiety and active care in the sick room,
                  sitting down to chat cosily over their bit of supper, which Winthrop owned he
                  needed very much. Maurice could not help intimating a little of his wonder. The
                  young priest colored a little, as if feeling himself censured by one with whom he
                  desired to stand well. The though crossed his mind that perhaps he had brought
                  scandal upon the Church, though nothing could be more temperate than both his
                  eating and drinking, as nothing could be fitter for the delicate and
                  slenderly-framed young man. But the old physician laid his hand upon Maurice's
                  shoulder. "My young friend," he said, "when you see as much of sick rooms as I
                  have, you'll find that the best way to do one's duty effectually in them, is to
                  carry as little out of them as you can. Sympathize as much as you like oft the
                  spot, provided it doesn't hinder your work, but when you are through, if you want
                  to keep well yourself and ready for the next emergency, do just what my friend
                  Winthrop here is doing. Let the whole matter alone—don't keep worrying over it. It
                  is all a matter of training and right Christian feeling. Winthrop for aught I know
                  may be going this next morning to marry Mr. Jones's daughter, or to baptize the
                  Slocum baby. Jones and Slocum have just as much right to his joyful sympathy as
                  poor Graham up stairs to his sorrowful sympathy; 'suum cuique—suum cuique' as we
                  used to say in college," and he held up his glass of port to the light and then
                  took a comfortable sip. "That's true, Doctor," said Winthrop, "and, Maurice, I
                  used to feel as you do at first, but I <emph>had</emph> to get over it; and I
                  don't find I do my work the worse, and so according to my theory I am going to bed
                  and to sleep, for it is most midnight."</p>
               <p>Maurice, however, lay long awake, listening to the roar of the wind and the heavy
                  beating of the surf upon the rocky point. Twice he fell into a doze and woke as
                  the massy house shook, dreaming that the Mystic was again sinking under him. The
                  third time he went off into a pro-founder slumber.</p>
               <p>His thoughts had not shaped themselves into definite form—he was busy speculating
                  over the things which Graham had let fall in his pain. Meanwhile the Doctor sat in
                  the sick-room sometimes dozing, sometimes waking and looking toward the sleeper.
                  He too had heard the half-uttered confessions, if confessions they were, and
                  though little prone to give much weight to the things which sick men say, he could
                  not help musing upon the words spoken that night.</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7264-00000110"/>
               <p>It was about four in the morning when Graham roused up suddenly. The storm had
                  died away, a fitful gust swept now and then around the house, but the wild dashes
                  of rain had ceased, and through the half-closed shutter a gleam of moonlight shone
                  into the room. The sick man was sitting up in bed. "Doctor," he said, "come here."
                  The Doctor was at his side in a moment. "I said some queer things last night, very
                  queer no doubt, but all true—but I want to tell you about them—you are an old man
                  like myself and these young ministers are just boys. One can't help me because he
                  don't know how to, and the other I don't like to tell such things to. But I'll
                  tell you. I wasn't in the slaving business myself, but this was it. My neighbor
                  Winston, on the street—Ward, Winston and Sikes, two doors West of me you know—came
                  to me a year or two ago to get me to join in a private investment. He wanted me to
                  put in fifteen thousand, and no questions asked. He was ready to let me have
                  collateral to the amount of thirty as security, and promised me cent. per cent.
                  return. I knew better when I did it, for that was no business way for a man who
                  could get what money he liked at the easiest rates, but I let him have it. After
                  he had got the money I went into our office one day and found that he had been
                  getting insurance on a ship, bound to the coast of Africa. I knew then that it was
                  no palm oil or ivory voyage, because he had offered a good deal better than the
                  regular rates. Six months after he came to me with his check for thirty thousand.
                  The Mercantile Mutual had to pay policy on the ship Seabird, run ashore on the
                  east end of Cuba. I suppose I might have objected, but there I was with that money
                  in my pocket, just bribed to keep still under the fraud. I don't see either,
                  Doctor, how I could have made a fuss, because I had no proof. Only my sitting easy
                  at the board of directors was just what Winston wanted, and had paid me to do.
                  Somehow I couldn't put that money into an honest business, especially when I came
                  to hear as I did about the Seabird's voyage. So I lent it to old Atkins, the
                  veriest old miserly landlord in the city, and he bought with it Typhus Row, where
                  the people died like rotten sheep this summer, and I've been making my seven per
                  cent, out of their sin and misery ever since. It is no use saying that I didn't do
                  it, and didn't know of it. Atkins came to me to ask me to use my influence with
                  the Board of Health to keep things quiet, and then he offered me half per cent, on
                  his rents, and he is getting fifty for every dollar he has ever paid there, if I
                  would only give a dinner at Delmonico's to the city reporters of one or two of the
                  papers, and at the same time let them understand that they had better make their
                  articles about the markets, and at any rate say nothing of Typhus Row. Then he
                  said, Wouldn't I just give them one or two invitations to my wife's large parties,
                  and let them have a limited credit with a Broadway tailor.' I saw he was awfully
                  frightened, but two things I didn't see, and these were why he should pay me so
                  liberally, for pulling his chestnuts out of the fire, and why he would not do the
                  work himself. However I told him I would take a loot: at the property, and give
                  him an answer the next day. I took a walk up —— street—garr! I can smell the smell
                  of it now. I just made an errand up one stair-case to look into one of the rooms,
                  and that was enough. I turned sick and faint, and had to get a glass of brandy at
                  the first oyster shop I came to. I didn't drink much of that either, Doctor, for
                  it was the regular-rifle stuff, kill at ten paces, you know, and what little I did
                  take, made my head spin like a top, and I understood how the men and women who
                  drink such stuff commit the murders and crimes they do. Well I got away, and when
                  I saw Atkins, he had a piece of my mind sure—and what do you think he said? Unless
                  I kept the newspapers off he'd sell the property, and I might foreclose for what I
                  could get. He said the property in his hands was worth something, but in any one
                  else's wouldn't he worth two cents, for it was just slated over with mortgages,
                  and he had given me a third instead of a first, and thin after the money was
                  loaned had given the wink to the other mortgagees, and they had put theirs on
                  record, and I must keep the property up or lose the whole. Then I cooled down—no,
                  Doctor, I'm not talking too long, it will ease me more than your medicines can—and
                  then I offered him if he'd just pay up and let me wash my hands of the concern, he
                  might have the six months interest due that day, and bribe the reporters with it
                  himself. He demurred, for he was afraid he'd have them black mailing him all the
                  time, and so he wanted me for catspaw. But this cash down was too<pb n="220-221"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000111"/> much for a man like him, so he gave in and said
                  he'd get a friend to fix the matter, and so he did with a vengeance. For this
                  friend went, and represented that I was the real owner, and did not want my name
                  known, and that they must let up until I could effect a sale. There's another nice
                  business. One of them, the ——'s reporter, came to me a week ago, and said that he
                  was a poor fellow, and thought that it was only a matter of business: when
                  gentlemen didn't want to be interfered with till they could sell their property,
                  and were ready to do the handsome thing, it was understood that any little
                  compliments of the kind were fair on both sides. 'But,' said he, Mr. Graham I've
                  had to go up into your block there after the murder at 131, and I saw what it was,
                  and I can't keep still any longer. I've pawned pretty much everything I have, and
                  I've lived on a few crackers a day for a week past to rake and scrape the price of
                  that dinner, and here's the money; it is just the price of blood, and I can't
                  touch it. I'll be a free man once more The tears came into his eyes as he put down
                  the money, and then he drew himself up, half expecting me to pitch into him, I
                  suppose. When I said nothing, he seemed to get courage, and on he went. 'Mr.
                  Graham you're a rich man, and I dare say haven't an idea what such dens are like,
                  but you wouldn't sleep to-night a sound sleep if you were to look into Typhus Row,
                  and I just beg you to heed for once what a poor devil of a newspaper man says, and
                  take a part of the rent you get to make that place a little more decent for human
                  beings to live in. I'm no fool. I don't ask you to make a model lodging-house or a
                  Fifth Avenue Palace, only make those rooms so that a fellow like me can go into
                  them, and not turn sick and faint at the sight and smell. If <emph>I</emph> can't
                  stand it after being week in and week out at the Criminal Courts, then you may
                  know it <emph>is</emph> bad.' I said to him, 'Keep your money: it was stolen from
                  me to pay for your dinner, and I give it to you to show up that thing as it ought
                  to be shown up. I don't own one brick or rafter there and never did. I lent some
                  money on it on bond and mortgage, and never saw the property till a month ago.
                  He's used my name for his own little business. I sha'n't tell you his name, for
                  you would be giving him that money back, and I mean, who have the best right to
                  say so, for you to keep it.' 'I'd give the fifty, and starve another week, and
                  pawn all the rest of my traps to have you own it; for then you would do something
                  about the place. Now it will be no good, I fear, saying anything.' Then I told him
                  how I was trapped, only I told no names, and he held out his hand to me, saying he
                  hoped I would excuse what he had said, and then he added frankly enough, 'Mr.
                  Graham, if you rich men would but look after the investing of your money as sharp
                  as you do after the making, things would be better all round. We are pretty hard
                  boys, we men of the press, but we see things very much as they are, and we don't
                  love wickedness the better for seeing it.' That cut deep. Here was this one sum,
                  which I didn't need, had been doing the devil's work straight through helping to
                  bring a cargo of slaves to Cuba, to cheat an honorable Insurance Company, to keep
                  up a tenement-house iniquity, and to bribe a poor fellow to forget his duty, and
                  to poison that well which ought to be keeping us all right and pure. I did not
                  know that it was doing all this mischief. But I might have known if I had taken
                  pains. I will say that I didn't suspect the slaving business till after it was
                  begun, but still I might have known that a private loan on such terms meant
                  mischief."</p>
               <p>"But Mr. Graham allow me to ask you one thing—why should Winston apply to you,
                  when he could have, used his own funds?" "Oh, I can't tell—he was ashamed of the
                  business, wanted to have another man—very likely my name was so used that in case
                  of a break up, I should have had to bear the brunt. They say the managers of those
                  infernal affairs who have only their necks to risk, take good care to have
                  responsible paying men to buy them out, and to hush up matters. Very likely I
                  risked an hundred thousand. Now just one word more, Doctor, and I have done. I
                  fear that money will just go under the devil's belly, as it came over his back. I
                  came up here to Norowam to see after a certain anonymous letter sent me, and
                  intimating that my son had been bringing sin and shame and misery into a poor
                  man's household, and that I must provide for that. If it be so, that money will go
                  as it came, and may be I'll go too." "I suspect," said the Doctor, "I can tell you
                  something about that letter. We country physicians know a good deal about many
                  matters. You<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7264-00000112"/> may rest easy so far as
                  your boy is concerned—he has been foolish, but he's not answerable for anything
                  but foolishness." "Thank Heaven—thank Heaven for that. Doctor, you've done me more
                  good by that word than all the medicine. Now just hear me make one promise, and
                  vow I'll put that money into the Savings Bank, and when I can find the man, I
                  don't care what his denomination, who isn't afraid to preach to us rich men our
                  duty, I'll build him a church with it; that I vow, and you are witness." The
                  shrewd old physician gave a quiet smile; he had heard such resolves before now,
                  but he was too good a Doctor to show his thoughts. We shall see bye and bye if
                  anything comes of it.</p>
               <p>Fair and clear rose the morn after the wild storm of the night. The Doctor
                  reported Mr. Graham as sleeping soundly and likely to recover. Winthrop went over
                  to the farm-house to see after his other patient. It was arranged that the two
                  were to be sent to the village after breakfast, which one of the servants said
                  would be ready in an half-hour. So Maurice gave one glance toward the beautiful
                  village reposing in its galley, and then turned down the long avenue which led to
                  the shore. It was strewn with leaves, and here and there a huge bough had been
                  snapped off. Lombardy poplars stood stiff and tall like giant brooms, the white
                  and ghostly branches of the buttonwoods towered above them, while beneath were
                  gnarled apple trees with slanting trunks and deep cavernous eyes in them which
                  decay had wrought. From the west came flapping the large, black and solemnly
                  flapping crows, now by ones and twos, and then in whole flocks. Over the blue
                  waves were flashing to and fro the wheeling flights of the sea-gulls. The air was
                  fresh and elastic as after a storm, and quite a little swell was rolling in upon
                  the rocky end of the point. Far across the Sound was swiftly gliding one of the
                  mighty steamers of that inland sea, delayed by the storm. If Maurice only had
                  known who looked out from its deck toward the grassy point! Out of the deep
                  "fiords" opposite, which form such capital harbors of refuge in a storm, were
                  stretching slowly out under shortened sail coasting craft, which had anchored
                  there from last night's gale. The blending smoke and steam like a mourning badge
                  of black and white was streaming from above the busy mills of "the Bay," as a
                  neighboring inlet was called It was a bright and joyful scene, one thoroughly
                  fitted to refresh the mind after the feverish atmosphere of a sickroom. Yet in
                  spite of all its freshness Maurice was thoroughly depressed. His thoughts
                  constantly reverted to his own failure. It was not in mortification but in a
                  deeper sense than anything personal could give. The more he thought upon it, the
                  more he felt satisfied that he could not have done differently. He was willing to
                  learn if there was aught to be learnt, but it did not seem so here. Yet it was
                  clear that Winthrop, much his inferior in many things, was nevertheless possessed
                  of a power and spirit, which gave him assured position and influence. He felt that
                  he could not have said the things Winthrop had said; that he did not wish to say
                  them. But what had he better to put in their place? To call them Orthodox stuff,
                  cant and the like was very easy, but his own words had been utterly powerless,
                  while in spite of prejudice against them, Winthrop's simple sayings went straight
                  to the mark. And then out of the clear bright morning there grew as it were, he
                  could not tell how, this, question. Was it not after all a broader field upon
                  which the true controversy was ranged? Was not the failure of the one and the
                  success of the other a test? Was it not something beside an accidental combination
                  of circumstances—was it not because one was building on the sand, and the other
                  upon the rock? Maurice started at the thought. "It is just a notion born of my
                  miserable vanity," he said to himself. "I am unfit for the ministry, and must seek
                  something else." But still the broader question would rise up; Was it not his
                  ministry itself which had been weighed and found wanting? Was it all a matter of
                  personal gifts?</p>
               <p>Very well, suppose it was; <emph>what</emph> were those gifts? He turned over in
                  his memory as he walked up the rough, worn lane toward the great house amid its
                  sheltering pines, the whole of the last night's scenes. Winthrop was a little
                  abrupt in manner, while foreign travel had given to Maurice great courtesy and an
                  almost feminine gentleness. Was it the power of sympathy? Maurice was feeling a
                  real and personal interest, while Winthrop was called to a mere stranger. Here
                  nevertheless was the clue, as he could not but feel. It was the difference of
                  personal relation.</p>
               <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7264-00000113"/>
               <p>Two or three days after Winthrop was again sent for to the house on the point. He
                  had a long interview with Mr. Graham, and came away looking very serious. The old
                  gentleman had made a full statement to him of all the foregoing matters. The young
                  priest had met it in a simple, quiet way. His first question was, "Have you ever
                  been baptized?" The answer was, as he suspected, "No." "Very well, then your first
                  step is there. Do you believe in the Saviour?" "I believe in you—I believe your
                  Church to be right, because it knows how to deal with a sick and sinful man. Your
                  Church teaches the Trinity, does it?" "Yes, most certainly." "And you believe the
                  Bible teaches that?" "I do; I know it." "Well I am too old to go into that
                  controversy; but if believing Christ to be God made you come and give comfort to
                  my sick bed, as you did, then it must be true. If it is true, then of course it is
                  right to do as you say. If Christ came to me, and said it was so, I should of
                  course believe it, though I did not understand how it could be, because I believe
                  in Him, Now when I see you showing Him, by acting just as I should say he would
                  send you to act, I think you must know what is right. I sent for Mr. Maurice
                  yesterday. He would not say he did not believe as you do. He told me liberal
                  Christianity would suffer a great loss if I left the Unitarians. I don't care for
                  that. It does nothing for me. Finally he told me I must follow my own convictions.
                  I could see it cut him dreadfully, though he was too much of a gentleman to act
                  badly about it. I wish you could get him." "But, my dear Sir, now you must think
                  of your own case. I wish earnestly to baptize you, but I cannot do it merely
                  because you trust in me." "I don't trust in you; I trust in the spirit that sent
                  you. I see that you are young. I dare say you are like other young ministers, but
                  this I do see, that you are in earnest, and 'mean what you say. If there is on
                  earth a Church which Jesus Christ founded, I am sure you belong to that Church,
                  and I want to belong to it, and I am ready to believe what it tells me to believe,
                  and to do what it requires." Winthrop talked long with him, but it always came
                  round to that. At last he said, "Next week the Doctor says you will be able to get
                  out again. If you are in the same mind then, and will come to the Church on
                  Wednesday morning, I will receive you." The old man pressed his hand hard, wiped a
                  tear or two from his eyes, and bade him good-by.</p>
               <p>Winthrop hesitated long whether to tell Maurice, but at last one night as they sat
                  together, he spoke. "To-morrow I am going to baptize Mr. Graham. I hope you won't
                  think I have been unfair to you." "No," said Maurice, "I did think so, but I see
                  his mind is made up—it has been more weakened by his illness than I thought. Still
                  if he goes, I am afraid my work here is broken up." He rose and paced the room in
                  agitation. "My salary won't be paid, that I don't care for. I have enough to live
                  on, but there are other things. I shall fight it out fairly, only I can't put
                  heart into it while I feel so uncertain myself. I can preach, but I cannot say
                  anything to people. I cannot get hold of them as you do. The fact is—I—I wish I
                  could feel, as you seem to do, that I was really a minister. I went to Ralston the
                  other clay, and he gave me a long dissertation upon the right of the people to
                  make me a minister, but when I pressed him upon this point why they could not
                  unmake me, he did not or would not meet it. Told me it would be time enough to
                  think of it when they did. I asked 'Could I become a Congregationalist if I would
                  accept his confession of faith?' He told me that just then he thought I should not
                  find an opening among them; they had more licentiates than paying parishes among
                  them, but, if I thought of trying it, he would give me letters to the New Haven
                  professors. 'But,' added he, if I were you, Maurice, I would go into the Episcopal
                  Schism Winthrop, I won't do that, at least not now. I will stand out to the
                  last—you have beaten me here, I give you fair warning that I shall beat you when I
                  can." He left Winthrop's room abruptly.</p>
               <p>The next morning, however, he was at St. Jude's as the bell was ringing. Mr.
                  Graham's carriage stood at the door. He entered the church in time to see the old
                  gentleman move slowly up the aisle, supported by his daughter. Maurice walked
                  firmly, almost defiantly up one of the side aisles, and took one of the square
                  wall pews, which filled the corner near the chancel—the old family pew in fact of
                  the family who owned the estate on the point, and once great patrons of St.
                  Jude's. The daughter, Miss Graham, sat unmovingly through the service. Maurice
                  watched her<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7264-00000114"/> intently. She was a
                  fashionably-dressed girl, a showy brunette. He had had several talks with her, and
                  she had been rather interested in his ritual plans, and had joined heartily in his
                  improved liturgy. But in the morning prayer of the church she would take no part.
                  Maurice, too, refused to give way to the impulse that he naturally felt, and for
                  the first time for many months neither knelt nor united in the Confession or the
                  Lord's Prayer. He turned restlessly over the leaves of the prayer-book till he
                  came to the Baptism of Adults. Gray-haired Dr. Donne paused after the second
                  lesson, and then stepped out of the desk to the front. Winthrop called for the
                  candidate. Mr. Graham came forward alone. Miss Graham let fall her veil suddenly.
                  To Maurice's great surprise Dr. Donne took his place by the side of the candidate
                  as witness, and tenderly found the places for him in the book which Graham held
                  with an unsteady hand. The congregation rose at the first words of the
                  exhortation, which Winthrop read with a voice of deep emotion. The congregation
                  were greatly touched. Tears were running down the Doctor's' cheeks. One old as
                  himself was taking the vows he had offered to so many during the long and
                  blameless years of his ministry. It was with an almost inaudible voice that the
                  candidate made the promises, but very fervently. Then, when he knelt and his white
                  hair touched the marble of the font scarcely whiter, and his hand clasped
                  Winthrop's, while the two surpliced priests stood beside him, the one so youthful
                  with so deep and spiritual an awe upon his beautiful face, the other so noble and
                  so loving, and when the clear water fell upon the aged bowed head, Maurice felt
                  his breath come thick and fast. Was he, could he remain an outcast from a church
                  like this? Was he to continue unsigned with the sign of the cross, no member of
                  the congregation of Christ's flock?</p>
               <p>The service was ended, and the few worshippers, some twenty or thirty, were
                  dispersing, as Maurice left the porch of St. Jude's. Pie joined one of them, a
                  young lady he had met at one of the little musical parties which Norowam is given
                  to. She greeted him with a look of surprise. "You here?" she said: "I did not
                  expect to meet <emph>you,</emph>" and then hesitated, recollecting that the
                  Grahams had been members of his society. "Yes," said he, "I came to take farewell
                  of a friend." "Not farewell, I hope," she replied gently. "Yes," said he, with a
                  tinge of bitterness, "if my old parishioner has been received into the
                  congregation of Christ's flock, he has left me outside. I am to him as a
                  heathen-man and a publican." "It is your own choice if you stay so—do you not
                  believe in baptism?" "I do not know what I believe in, certainly not much in
                  myself." "No. Mr. Maurice," said one behind them, and Maud De-Forrest came to
                  their side—"No, Mr. Maurice, you do not believe in yourself, and I am thankful for
                  it. You have been doing so too long; that has been your trouble. You are
                  struggling now with the old feeling of personal pride and independence; you are
                  unwilling to submit yourself." "Why should I submit to Alf. Winthrop, who is
                  younger and certainly no wiser than I am; or to Dr. Donne, who is an old proser
                  and a bigoted conservative, who has not an idea outside his prayer-book?" Maurice
                  knew that he was bitterly, grossly unjust, and a pang of conscience smote him, but
                  he fancied the young ladies were triumphing over him, and he was determined to
                  shock them. In truth he was very sore. He felt it had been pre-eminently his own
                  failure.</p>
               <p>Miss Hale <emph>was</emph> shocked, and drew herself up coldly. But Maud read him
                  better, and after a moment's silence, turned the conversation. "I expect my uncle
                  soon; he wants to see you very much; he was so much pleased with you abroad," she
                  said with great tact, "and I can never forget how kind you were to Frank." Maud
                  was dressed in slight mourning. Maurice had never noticed that before. He fancied
                  that it was a recent change. She was a little paler than when they first met. "I
                  am going to "spend the winter here with Miss Hale. I shall be always happy to see
                  you," she continued. "What! a heretic like me?" was his reply, for his bitter mood
                  was not appeased. "Yes, with all your heresies, which are not so deep as you
                  fancy." "I am not so sure of that," he said, and then being at his hotel-door, he
                  bade the ladies an abrupt good morning, and went to his room in a very
                  dissatisfied mood. For a time he did turn toward heresy. He took to studying
                  Parker, and the advanced neologists, and would not enter the doors of St. Jude's.
                  He became morose and selfish. He could not satisfy himself with his new allies;
                  their arguments appeared<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7264-00000115"/> to him both
                  strained and unfair, but he clung to them desperately and bitterly. Maud he saw
                  now and then, but there was a shadow between them not lessened by the sharp and
                  unkind satire covert in his words. He began to weary of his parochial work—his
                  preaching and all. What was the use—why should he not go back to Europe? The
                  fruits of a creedless faith were beginning to grow.</p>
               <p>The Christmas-tide recalled him. In the clear, cold, healthy weather he got time
                  for reflection. He had just received and read that remarkable book of F. W.
                  Newman's, "The Soul," and it revealed to him, as a precipice, the edge over which
                  he was falling. He went to Winthrop, and frankly owned that he had been greatly
                  and unfairly estranged from him, and by way of a peace-offering was present at the
                  Christmas eve service of St. Jude's, and would have gone the next morning had not
                  the Feast of the Nativity that year fallen on Sunday. Also he heard with great
                  equanimity that Mr. Graham had taken a pew in the church of St. Cyril's, New York,
                  and that Gertrude Graham was to be confirmed with her father. Not so his own
                  people. They were bitterly disappointed, and he had to run the gauntlet of various
                  hard speeches. He was told, almost in so many words, that the defection of Mr.
                  Graham was owing to his neglect to call on him in his sickness; he heard that he
                  had been sent for, and refused to go to the Point, and that Mr. Winthrop had heard
                  of it, and walked down in the storm through three feet of water. In vain did
                  Winthrop deny the story. It was generally believed, and by none more than those
                  who complained most loudly of his favoritism in visiting the Grahams. There was a
                  neighboring Universalist minister very anxious to get to Norowam, who spent much
                  of his week-day leisure in visiting and in cringing to Maurice's congregation.</p>
               <p>It was not possible, in a small place like Norowam, to overlook the social
                  attractiveness of a young man like Bryan Maurice. Not long after his coming, there
                  was gathered a party of girls in the music-parlor of one of the handsomest''
                  houses of the place. It was about ten o'clock iii the morning. They had just come
                  in from the church—for old St. Jude's kept the litany days. One or two of the
                  girls had taken off their bonnets and thrown them upon the piano, and had
                  clustered together upon the sofa, with arms twined about each other's waists. It
                  would be a pleasant task to sketch them all, for they had faces of marked
                  character and individuality. They belonged to that class of girls that are found
                  now and then in small towns, and perhaps in small sets in cities—those who have
                  grown up in comparative unconsciousness of the charms of male society. Girls who
                  ride, or row, or skate, or study German, or sketch—not as accomplishments which
                  shall render them attractive to men, but as pursuits into which they go with their
                  whole heart—are not usually wanting in wit or agreeableness, unless it be that
                  superficial polish of manner which may varnish the most repulsive feminine
                  natures. "Girls, I'm going to have a party next week, and I'm going to have
                  somebody that can do something besides dance. I never saw such a place for
                  gentlemen. There goes Mr. Maurice—I will make Henry call and invite him." This
                  came from the fair-haired blonde, Ernestine, the most impulsive of all. "But,
                  Erne, dear," said Adah, "it won't do—he's a Universalist minister."—"I don't care
                  for that; if he was the Catholic priest, I don't see why he shouldn't come to a
                  party. You needn't go to his church, and I am not afraid to tell him so. But just
                  see here, girls. I want to know what you think about this thing. Here are we girls
                  expected to be very good, and not know when a young man is dissipated, though you
                  can almost feel it in your bones when one like Ned Beverly comes near you. We must
                  meet them in society, and think nothing about it; but when a young man who is as
                  pure and good as can be comes to town, and is really entertaining and cultivated,
                  we mustn't have anything to say to him. I suupose it is all right, but I don't see
                  that a wicked Episcopalian is so much better than a good Universalist." "You had
                  better," said Hortense, "ask Mr. Winthrop about that." Some of the girls laughed
                  slyly. Ernestine went eagerly on, as was her wont, "I'm sure he goes with him all
                  the time—besides, Gerty Graham says he is the most agreeable young man she has met
                  these two years. Besides, he comes to morning prayers very often indeed."—"Only
                  twice, Erne, since he came."—"Well, twice in two months is a good deal for
                  him."</p>
               <p>So the end was, that Ernestine, with her wilfulness and impetuosity did have
                  Maurice invited to her party. His going gave great scandal to a part of his flock.
                     Ernestine<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7264-00000116"/> Ayling moved in a circle
                  quite apart from the village people, and though ready enough to meet on frank
                  terms all, whatever their rank, in her own church—indeed, she would go down into
                  the cellar of a poor sick Irishwoman, and tend her crying babies by the hour—she
                  chose to keep aloof from the rest, and she showed it very clearly.</p>
               <p>Into the elegant drawing-rooms of her father's house, the good people of the first
                  Universalist Society never set foot. The elder people were rather proud of the
                  social success of their minister. The younger ones, who, at first, were delighted
                  to find that he did not take them to task for attending village "hops," and
                  "sociables," and negro-minstrel concerts and semi-theatrical shows, began to feel
                  that he belonged to them, and had no business where they could not go. They wanted
                  to keep him to themselves, while they were afraid of him withal. He was of a
                  social culture far beyond them. He evidently did not sympathize with their romping
                  flirtations. When he tried to talk of religious matters, he was out of their
                  depths. There was no objective life of a visible church upon which he could meet
                  them. Winthrop for all his young people had plenty of topics—their Sunday-school
                  classes, their district visitings, greens at Christmas, lilies at Easter, the
                  proper ways of joining in the service, the plain Bible teachings in which, at his
                  weekly class, he interested them without bewildering them. Winthrop could meet
                  each and all without reserve or embarrassment or weariness, though by birth and
                  temperament aristocratic to a degree.</p>
               <p>Maurice found that, while his young people received him with apparent cordiality
                  at their homes, they were awed and mystified at his approaches. He had nothing
                  positive to lead them to. On general topics he could not meet them. Their simple
                  enthusiasm over Tupper and Mrs. South-worth's novels, and the thin fictions of the
                  "Ledger" and "Weekly" and Ladies' Magazines, he dashed with unconscious
                  epigrammatic sharpness of ridicule. He had laughed heartily and publicly over
                  certain sentimental verses in the poet's corner of the village newspaper in the
                  presence of the unlucky authoress,—of course, in all innocence,—and mortally
                  offended her. He underrated their culture, superficial as it was, and was annoyed
                  and repelled by their ignorance of the matters which his exclusive but elevated
                  Harvard training deemed the essentials of all education. Still his manners were so
                  good, his politeness so genuine, that they resented, all the more for their awe of
                  him, his capture, as they regarded it, by those proud and exclusive city
                  people.</p>
               <p>Maurice went to the party at the Aylings' and enjoyed himself exceedingly. He met
                  Maud De Forrest, who declined dancing in his favor, and sat with him half the
                  evening by the window which opened into the beautiful conservatory, and through
                  whose glass walls they caught glimpses of the moonlight sleeping on the fair lawn,
                  and throwing deep shadows among the belts of shrubbery. They talked of Europe, of
                  course; and as the conversation strayed into other channels, Maud gave him rapt
                  attention which both flattered and yet puzzled him. It was not girlish
                  fascination, however. Pie could not help noting that, while she watched him most
                  closely, it was not with sympathizing eagerness. He came to suspect—and it
                  startled his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">amour propre</foreign>—that she was drawing
                  him out. Yet it did not seem to be in order that she might reply. When he let fall
                  a paradox, it met no answering dissent. She seemed to note it a moment, and then
                  to let it pass by, occasionally asking a question or making a comment which simply
                  tested his sincerity. Now and then she could not conceal that she knew more of him
                  than he had supposed. She allowed, nay, encouraged him to talk of his plans in his
                  ministry,—indeed, seemed to take greater interest in that than in aught else
                  concerning him. The thought crossed his mind at last that she was seeking the
                  Unitarian fold. He made ready at once to use the chance, and waxed eloquent upon
                  his hopes and visions of an improved liberal Christianity. She met it most
                  unexpectedly. "Are you so happy, Mr. Maurice, so contented in your
                     <emph>new</emph> faith, that you would wish me or any other to partake it? Are
                  you so certain yourself; that you feel you could give me, for the one hope of my
                  life, any thing clearer and better?"</p>
               <p>She looked him fixedly in the face, and waited for his reply. None came. He could
                  not say yes. He did not like to say no. Her eyes fell, and the color rose to her
                  cheeks. She drew a quick breath, and then a smile played around her beautiful
                  mouth,—the unfathomable smile of a young girl's happy thought, Then she said
                  simply, without<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7264-00000117"/> a shade of coquetry,
                  "You must not think you have tired me. I like to talk to you very much, but we
                  must not monopolize each other. Let me introduce, you to that lady on the sofa
                  opposite. She is a dear friend of mine who is soon going abroad, and would like to
                  hear about what she is to see." So Maurice was taken across the room, and
                  presently found himself giving, as he was ready enough to do, descriptions of
                  Oxford and the English cathedrals to an untiring listener. "Oh, Mr. Maurice, how
                  you must have wished," she said, after a brilliant sketch of Canterbury, "how you
                  must have wished it was your church! I don't see how you could have come back a
                  Unitarian."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I did not," he said. "What do you fancy a Unitarian to be?" "Oh! but I
                  can see that you did not love these things because they were true, but because
                  they were beautiful. You smiled just now at my delight over St. Jude's. Of course,
                  I know that it is not to be compared at all with those glorious churches, but it
                  is the same home. I should not be a stranger there, because <emph>this</emph> can
                  speak to my heart." "But the English service is not the same,—it is quite
                  different, especially in the cathedrals." "Oh! but it is the same. This house, you
                  know, is not like a nobleman's castle, but still it is a house in which one lives.
                  The lesser differences go for nothing. It is not like the tent of a menagerie,
                  where one could never be at home."</p>
               <p>The young girl blushed and looked frightened, as if she had been unintentionally
                  rude. Maurice caught the drift of her thought. "You mean that we Unitarians are
                  somewhat of wild beasts, and not at home in drawing-rooms. Well, I get your point.
                  I'm not sure but that you are right. I certainly felt so the first time I went to
                  a Roman Catholic church abroad." "Oh! pray forgive me if I have said anything
                  rude,—indeed, I did not mean that at all. I only wanted to explain why I shall
                  feel when I go to an English cathedral as if I belonged to it and it to me." "I
                  think I understand you," he said, gravely, "and I am not in the least offended.
                  You know I am trying to make my own tent a little more habitable; perhaps it may
                  bring me in time to the Orthodox house. At present, you see, I like it, because I
                  can pitch it where I will, and that is a great compensation for having to live in
                  it with the big bears and the noisy monkeys:—"which saucy speech the young lady
                  could not resist repeating again; and it was carried, in due time, to the ears of
                  some of the first Unitarian families in his congregation, in that distorted shape
                  such sayings always are; and it was told that Mr. Maurice had said at the Aylings'
                  party that his people were bears and monkeys, and that his church was no better
                  than a circus tent.</p>
               <p>Some of the young gentlemen of the company made a little too free with the
                  champagne at supper, and the legend was forthwith added that Mr. Maurice who
                  certainly was in the supper-room with all the other guests, and joined Winthrop
                  and Ralston in a single glass of their host's Old Madeira, was one of the party
                  who laughed and talked so noisily in going home. He had gone quietly home long
                  before; but the Methodist minister of Norowam, who was a fierce teetotaller, made
                  much of the story in his Sunday night's discourse the next week. He was afraid to
                  allude to Ralston, who could give as good as he got, and liked Winthrop; so he
                  singled out poor Maurice, as an Universalist who was outside the pale of
                  evangelical brotherhood.</p>
               <p>He made a striking and brilliant use of the parable of Lazarus and the Rich Man,
                  whose name, he informed his hearers, was Dives (pronounced as a monosyllable), and
                  dwelt upon the denial of one drop of water to cool the tongue, "which was all
                  burned up by the fever of drinkin' and drunkenness."</p>
               <p>Maurice laughed when he heard of it; but the scandal stuck as scandals do. It did
                  not affect his own people much, but it checked his rising popularity with the
                  young people of that floating class who go to all places of worship in
                  indiscriminate religious dissipation, and who had liked the enthusiasm and
                  elegance of his preaching.</p>
               <p>For Maurice preached well, and there was a freshness about his other services
                  while they were fresh to him, which was quite unlike the droning ways of the
                  regular hacks of extempore worship,—so called. The trouble was, they would not
                  stay fresh to himself, because he lacked the true basis of worship,—a fixed
                  faith.</p>
               <p>Had he no faith? He sometimes asked himself that question, bitterly enough. He
                  had; but it was in advance of his practice. He was ever trying to realize
                  something from which he found himself held back. Every Sunday<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000118"/> night left him feverish and dissatisfied. He tried
                  to inculcate a high, unselfish morality, but that ever haunted him with the idea
                  that it was not enough. It had no answer to the obstinate question "why?" Besides,
                  there was a hard practical soil of common-place Universalism in his little flock,
                  upon which he could make no impression. They were not worse than their accepted
                  standards of duty; but nothing would lift them above these.</p>
               <p>Toward spring his congregation began to wane. They wanted coarser and stronger
                  aliment "Why don't he pitch into the doctrine of the Trinity, or go it strong
                  against hell-fire?" they said; "we've had enough of the beauty of holiness."
                  Having nothing better to do, they revived the old stories about Ayling's party;
                  and finally one bold male-content, who had been long in favor of the Universalist
                  brother who ministered up at Batestown, ventured to tell Maurice that he had
                  better resign. Maurice was stung by it. In vain his managing man laughed at it,
                  and promised to stick by Maurice to the last, and that when the city folks came up
                  in the summer, the Church of St. Arius, as Maurice affected to call it, would be
                  full to overflowing. He brooded over it continually. So one fair evening, as he
                  was walking up the main street, he saw in the distance Mrs. Mehitable West, the
                  most dreaded of all his female enemies, and the sharpest-tongued gossip,
                  approaching him. Like a wise man, he turned and fled, or rather walked swiftly
                  away, and, ere he bethought of himself, he had come to the wall of the little
                  burial-ground by which were rising the almost completed walls of the chapel of St.
                  Mark's. He paused by the old stone wall, and looked over into the weedy and
                  neglected resting-place of the dead of the Episcopal Church. He saw a female
                  figure in the act of laying something upon one of the graves. A second look showed
                  him Maud De Forrest. A strong impulse sent him to her side. She looked tip from
                  her work, which was the adjustment of a wreath of <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >immortelles</foreign> upon a tombstone, and greeted him quietly. "'Memento
                  mori' I see is your motto, to-night," said he; "I should think, Miss De Forrest,
                  that it is rather a serious task for one so young." "Mr. Maurice, that is not a
                  fitting speech for you, since we both have reason to remember the early dead in
                  the Lord. I am thinking of the lonely cemetery at Rome, and you surely have not
                  forgotten the Atlantic waves." The words thrilled Maurice with a sudden shame. "I
                  shall never forget the one nor the other," said he, hurriedly. "Then why forget
                  the faith that made those deaths so happy? Mr. Maurice, I must speak to you. God
                  has put this chance into my hands. We both have buried our hearts. I can speak to
                  you as a sister would, without maidenly shame for speaking earnestly. Frank was to
                  me all that Ellen was to you." (Maurice had told her the story of his homeward
                  voyage.) "Parental opposition, founded on a foolish political quarrel, separated
                  us. It is right you should know that, though it half kills me to recall it. I
                  shall always remain his widow in spirit. Now you can understand why I may interest
                  myself in you. You are his legacy to me,—and your welfare is very precious for his
                  sake." Tears came into her sweet eyes as she spoke. She went on: "You are in the
                  wrong place, I went to hear you preach last Sunday night. I do not think it right
                  for me to do so ordinarily, though you have often asked me. I could not enter a
                  place of worship which, in its whole service, denies all I hold dear. Let me say
                  out my say if you please," she said, as he was about to speak. "I did go to hear
                  you,—not from curiosity,—but because I wanted to know where you really stood. Had
                  I believed that you were a Unitarian preacher for life, I would never have
                  listened to you. Something my cousin Winthrop told me made me doubt. I am now
                  certain that you will not be one. Every line of your sermon was a record of the
                  battle in your own mind. You were trying not to convince your flock, but yourself.
                  It satisfied them,—thank God, it did not satisfy you! I saw it in your face when
                  you ended."</p>
               <p>Maurice had yielded to the desire for a polemical discourse on the part of his
                  people, and it was even as she had said. He had fought the Unitarian battle, and,
                  in his strong conscientiousness, had lost it. And this young girl had read him
                  truly. They were standing where they could look through the empty arches of the
                  windows of the chapel, into which the rising moon, near the full, was shining.
                  "Something tells me, Mr. Maurice," she continued, "that you will yet kneel at the
                  altar which shall be consecrated there." The same thought went through his mind
                  just ere she spoke.</p>
               <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7264-00000119"/>
               <p>"Tell me," he said, entreatingly, "by what art you are so reading my very
                  soul."—"By no art—I cannot help seeing it."—"Yes," he said sadly, after a pause,
                  you are right. I am in doubt, and that sermon made me resolve, never to preach
                  another, almost. I see that this system of ours does not help me to do the things
                  I am set to do. I cannot visit the sick, or save men from evil ways, or comfort
                  those in trouble, or even teach the little ones, because of perpetual doubt. I see
                  your cousin Winthrop, who is no better man than I—I mean in mind—in his simple
                  way, doing all these things, and I do see that there is a power behind him by
                  which he does them." "He believes in his office," she said, "and you do not. He
                  has a faith to preach, and you only a system of nicely balanced denials." "But why
                  have I no faith? I know I have not—but why? I have the Bible as well as he."</p>
               <p>"Because you lack the keystone of your arch. Before a line of the Gospels was
                  written, the foremost Apostle confessed his Lord, saying, 'Thou art the Christ,
                  the Son of the living God.' Surely more was wrapped up in that saying, which flesh
                  and blood had not revealed unto him, but the Father in heaven—a saying for which
                  his Lord pronounced him blessed'—than that Jesus of Nazareth was a teacher, or
                  even the teacher of righteousness. But you long ago gave your heart to the Master;
                  give Him your faith now:—believe that He did not leave his Church comfortless,
                  without certain knowledge of Him." "Where is his Church?" asked Maurice. "The
                  Church of the Apostles—the Church which holds to apostolic faith and practice. Not
                  the future ideal Church which men are always going to rear; but the one once
                  built—the Church that is weak, imperfect, sinful, because of men and for men; but
                  divine because given by God. The Church that is not cumbered with expedients of
                  much serving; but sitting at the Lord's feet and learning of him. But I must
                  return home. Will you kindly see me to my own door, for it is late for me?"</p>
               <p>Maurice could only bow, and they left the spot, Maud was silent, and he felt he
                  could not speak. She, though he knew it not, was inwardly praying—he was repeating
                  to himself her words over and over again. As they reached the house, in the
                  pleasant bowery street, a tall gentleman met them at the gate. "Oh! uncle, have
                  you come? I am so glad!" exclaimed she. "Uncle, this is Mr. Maurice, and you are
                  in the right time." And Maurice met the proffered hand of Gardiner with a clasp in
                  the energy of which was the first joy of a returning hope.</p>
               <p>"Come in, come in," said Gardiner. "I cannot," said Maurice; "I must go to my room
                  to-night. I half expect a friend from he city, and must not be out." Maud's
                  countenance fell. "I am sorry for it, for it is no one I care much to see, and I
                  shall have to be at home all the evening." Maurice had plead the excuse in a
                  sudden attack of shyness. A talk with Gardiner was what he had been longing for,
                  yet he dreaded it. "Cannot I see you to-morrow?" he said. "No, I go to the city in
                  the morning. I only stopped over to see my niece and Winthrop. I am sorry, too,
                  for I hoped for a chat with you, and was quite rejoiced when I saw you coming down
                  the street."</p>
               <p>Maurice stood irresolute. "I can spare you, uncle," said Maud. There was a meaning
                  tone in her voice which the quick ear of Gardiner caught. "Come," said he, "I
                  won't lose the chance; your friend can't be up till half past nine?" "No," said
                  Maurice. "Very well, then, I'll come up to your room, and sit till then."</p>
               <p>Maurice did not decline, and Gardiner went with him to his room. When they were
                  comfortably established there, Gardiner began: "Well, my young friend, you are
                  just where I expected to find you." "What, in Norowam?" said Maurice, astonished.
                  "No, of course not; I mean in the Unitarian ministry. Have you found your ideal of
                  a church?" "No, sir, I have not." "Are you contented?" "No, sir, the furthest from
                  it." "The first thing you have to do is to get out of it at once; you have
                  determined the thing you were in doubt upon when we met in Rome——whether to be a
                  Christian; I take that for granted by finding you; in the ministry." "Then, sir,"
                  said Maurice, jumping at the supposed admission, "you grant me to be a Christian
                  minister?" "Oh, no! it shows a Christian purpose in you, that is all; but the
                  intent cannot make the accomplishment You might determine to be a lawyer; but, if
                  you studied the jurisprudence of China, that would hardly fit you for the American
                  bar. If you purposed to be a physician, but persisted in taking up only quack
                  science, you would not be one. There is but one Christian ministry—that
                     established<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7264-00000120"/> by Christ and his
                  apostles. There can be but one." "But how am I to find that? many claim to be."
                  "Go back to first principles." "But none are agreed upon those." "Pardon me, all
                  are agreed; it is upon secondary results that men begin to quarrel." Maurice
                  looked, as he felt, bewildered. "It is a simple question of history." "But
                  historians differ." "No, there is but one history, the New Testament; you receive
                  that as authority?" "Yes, sir." "Very well, then, that is settled. Now take the
                  Book of the Acts; does that speak of a church to be, or of one that is? Clearly of
                  one in being. 'The Lord added daily to the Church Then what are we to look for in
                  that book; rules for making a church, accounts of the formation of a church, or
                  allusion to one already formed? Which was first, the Church or the book?" "The
                  book, I suppose," said Maurice, after a pause. "So far, so good. Now, if those
                  recognitions correspond to certain established facts, purporting to relate back to
                  that period, tally with them, do they not prove the origin of the facts, and that
                  they were pre-existent to the record?" "They do." Furthermore, if you find these
                  same facts continued in the Epistles, written still later on, do they not confirm
                  the others?" "Yes, sir." "For instance, when St. Paul writes from Ephesus to
                  Corinth concerning the right way to observe the Lord's supper, can you' not see,
                  that there was a' Church there already practicing that rite, something for his
                  letter to be addressed to, and for it to be about?" "I see that," said Maurice; "I
                  wonder I never saw it before." "Easily enough, because your Bible was put into
                  your hand as a talisman, an oracle, not as a revealed history. Now turn to that
                  history. You find officers mentioned by titles—apostles, presbyters, and deacons;
                  you find a laity also; you find the mention of baptism as the sacrament of
                  initiation; you find a formula of faith alluded to." "Stop, there comes in a
                  doubt. If there be such an one, why not give in full?" "For the reason I just gave
                  you; it was already in practice, and for another reason to cone presently.</p>
               <p>"Belief is required, is it not?" "Yes, sir." "Belief in what? Not in Christian
                  principles," said Gardiner, seeing Maurice hesitate. "Those are results, not
                  starting points. Very well, then, to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, must you
                  not know something about Him? Put yourself into the position of a Greek Gentile,
                  and imagine me Apollos of Alexandria telling you to believe on Him, would not your
                  first question be as to what you ought to believe?" "Yes, of course." "Should I
                  not have to tell you what He was?" "You would send me to the Bible." "But I have
                  no Bible. There is no Greek New Testament yet written, and you could not
                  understand my Hebrew Scriptures, even in the version of the Septuagint. I must
                  tell you facts, and those facts I must put in a shape for you to remember easily,
                  and dwell on daily. They must be also essential facts; and do not essential facts
                  imply others? Do they not—and what I meant to say is just this—do they not imply
                  the further statements which shall limit them against further contradictions?"</p>
               <p>"I do not quite see that." "Let me put it for you a little more explicitly. I tell
                  you that Jesus Christ was crucified, dead, and buried. Some false teacher—let us
                  say my former disciple, Apollinarius we will call him—some false teacher
                     <emph>tells</emph> you that Christ did not really die; only a phantom suffered
                  on the cross. Remember you are a Greek; and this whole debate touches upon the one
                  vital point which can interest you—the resurrection of the body. Does not this
                  require me, as an authoritative teacher, to show you that He was man as well as
                  God—born of the Virgin Mary, as well as conceived of the Holy Ghost?"</p>
               <p>"I see," said Maurice. "Then you must grant a creed to be the only way to show
                  that you did believe. You are not, as now-a-days, supposed to believe, because you
                  read a Bible. You find it a very vital question, outside or inside the Church, is
                  what it turns upon."</p>
               <p>"Well, I see a creed is necessary; I am not disposed to fight that: but the
                  extra-scriptural language of the Nicene Creed is another matter; there is my true
                  difficulty. I have been an Arian, I think." "The Council of Nice did not change:
                  it only affirmed the faith of the Church. Extra-scriptural denials required
                  extra-scriptural terms to re-affirm the unchanged faith." "Can you prove that?"
                  "Certainly. Read the history of that Council, and you will see." "But there was no
                  affirmation by the Lord's own lips of His Divinity."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me! there was. There was assumption by Him<pb n="240-241"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000121"/> of the prerogatives of Divinity. Forgiveness of
                  sins by His own personal authority, for one. He was underetood by the Jews to
                  claim that position. 'Thou, being a man, makest thyself God.' was their
                  accusation." "Why did He not explicitly claim that, then?" "For the best of
                  reasons. If they could not see the proof that was in His works, to which He
                  constantly referred them, His bare assertion would have carried no weight. I have
                  always regarded the indirectness of the Lord's reply a most convincing proof. He
                  was leading them, if they could, to work out the conclusion themselves. He always
                  taught the public in that manner; sowing the seeds of truth, as it were, out of
                  sight that they might grow. The Divinity of the Lord <emph>is</emph> taught
                  explicitly by St. John, who expressly affirmed it. We know that, because it is in
                  answer to denials. The Word, the Logos, which we know from the controversies of
                  the time means only Christ, is declared by him to be God. Then what was the first
                  denial? Not of the Lord's Divinity, but of His Humanity. Now that shows most
                  plainly that the Church did not hold that He was neither God nor man." "Well, I
                  waive the creeds." "But will you not receive them? Will you not concede that the
                  Church held them both, apostolic faith and apostolic order? Could it hold anything
                  else?" "No, sir." "Then when there is now in being a Church which claims original
                  descent, and shows for her claim the Holy Scriptures, a present ministry, and the
                  unchanged faith, has it no claim upon you?" "Yes, sir; but what becomes then of
                  one's liberty of conscience, of free opinion?" "Have you liberty to hold a
                  falsehood?" "No, sir, not in conscience," said Maurice, after a thoughtful pause,
                  "Does it not, then, mean free opinion to choose the right?" "But suppose I do not
                  choose?" "Then you take the consequence, which puts you where you are."</p>
               <p>"But you say," said Bryan, trying to work away from the position, "you say
                  apostolic Order: that always seemed to me an unfounded assumption on the part of
                  your Church." "Why unfounded? What is the meaning of the word 'Apostle?' I need
                  not <emph>tell</emph> you to define that." "One sent, of course," said Maurice.
                  "Now turn to the Epistles to the Seven Churches of Asia. What are they called
                  there? 'Angels,' that is, messengers—the same idea only modified, more personal to
                  the office. You have the two sides of the thought—the one sent, the one who bears
                  the message, who may be removed one step from the original commission."</p>
               <p>"But I never," said Bryan, "understood the Angels of the Churches to mean men; I
                  thought it was a figurative personifying of the Church." Gardiner smiled. "Well
                  done, New England! I hope you are willing to accept the new exegesis, since, in
                  some parts of the Church Catholic, the title has been preserved to this day, or
                  was till lately. Now take the movement of the idea: first, the founders of
                  Christianity were to be witnesses of the kingdom, then preachers of the kingdom,
                  then administrators of the kingdom. The next step is to call the same officer the
                  representative head of the Church, the overscer—Episcopos—marking the change of
                  the Church from a missionary to a permanent estate. It would be a parallel case,
                  if we called our first bishops in this country, who were consecrated abroad,
                  Apostles, as sent from the Mother Church; our missionary bishops, Angels; and when
                  they became diocesan or see bishops, Episcopals—Bishops."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Maurice; "but I have always thought that the apostles were distinct in
                  office as well as in name." "Only in this, they were witnesses, a power which was
                  personal and could not descend. And they were founders, a prerogative which could
                  not be repeated. So the first kings of a dynasty are founders, but that does not
                  prevent their successors from being kings. Royalty descends: primal position does
                  not, of course. But look at another point. Who were the pseudo-apostles—false,
                  sham apostles? Just mark the significance of that fact. They belong to a little
                  later period of the Church. Do you suppose that they were men who personated the
                  original twelve? That would be a trick unmasked at once. It was only to confront
                  them with a witness vim had known the real parties, to demand a miracle, and they
                  would be exposed. Do you think St. Paul would have hesitated at that? Does he
                  anywhere write 'Certain have come to you, pretending to be Peter or James or John;
                  but James is dead, and Peter is in the East, and John is with me here in Ephesus,
                  and will shortly come to you?' No: what these false apostles claimed was the
                  office, not the personality, of the twelve. Now, nothing could be in are
                  improbable than the one deception should be<pb n="242-243"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000122"/> ever attempted; nothing more likely than that the
                  other would be. The See-Episcopate not yet being established and defined, and the
                  original apostolate increased by the ministry to the Gentiles, there is just one
                  time when this pseudo-apostolate is possible, between the dawning and the daylight
                  of the Church. Now the point I make is just here: these men would not have
                  attempted a pretence, by its very nature, baseless. Hence it follows, that there
                  could be true apostles not of the original twelve, or, like St. Paul, specially
                  commissioned. We do not counterfeit bank-notes for countries having no
                  paper-currency: the forgery proves a true original. For instance, if it were in
                  doubt whether there were original Gospels in existence at a particular date the
                  existence of apocryphal Gospels goes far to prove the fact."</p>
               <p>Maurice saw the point, but fought hard. He was not now a seeker open to all phases
                  of truth, but standing on his own ground of prejudice. "It seems to me," he said,
                  "more natural that these separate church communities should have organized
                  themselves. What possible sympathy could there be between scholastic Athens and
                  commercial Corinth, Asian Ephesus and the stern imperialism of Rome? I rather
                  judge that the different church systems which are organic and representative
                  sprang up about the same time, originating from different sources, and called into
                  being by diverse social necessities. These were afterwards hardened into one
                  concrete form by the usurpations of the hierarchy, which then developed into the
                  patriarchate and the papacy."</p>
               <p>There came an amused look over Gardiner's face as he listened, and at the end he
                  broke out into a laugh. "Excuse me, but I cannot help enjoying your idea. I
                  suppose the church at Ephesus must then have been episcopal, at Corinth
                  congregational (there were certainly proceedings somewhat savoring of Independency
                  until the hierarchy, in the person of Bishop Paul of Tarsus, put a heavy hand on
                  them.) We should look for Quakers at Philadelphia, if anywhere; and as for Athens,
                  why not let us say, liberal Christians, who did not believe the resurrection of
                  the dead? But, seriously, I am glad to see that you have thought upon the matter
                  from that point of view. There is a profound truth in what you have said just now.
                  It is just what would have resulted had Christianity in the mere form of doctrine
                  taken root in these different centres, viz., an independent growth of conflicting
                  systems; but, mark my words, if it had taken root. That was just as impossible as
                  to make corn grow on an iceberg from seeds let fall by passing birds. However, let
                  me examine your position in full." And Gardiner drew himself up with the look of
                  one who feels that the day is his own, seeing that the enemy has left a fatal gap
                  in his centre. "In the first place, your theory of differences needs modification.
                  There were to all these places unity of law and community of language. That you
                  admit. Then there was the great solvent of the Hebrew element in all these. The
                  basis of almost every Gentile church was its Hebrew converts. Your thought is of
                  the west, western. You fancy a number of men educated upon the Christian basis
                  forming their mere ecclesiastical clubs as it were according to their own notions.
                  But the church came to all these communities ready-formed. There was nothing to go
                  upon on the part of the converts, but what they received. They could originate
                  nothing, possessing nothing beforehand. Can you not see how utterly impossible it
                  would be for any Christian truth to come to them except through institutions? Now
                  just take St. Paul arriving at Corinth. He embodies the church in himself. He has
                  the ordaining power; he possesses the doctrine. He has the right to baptize and
                  administer the sacraments. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Ubi apostolos ibi
                     ecclesia.</foreign> What does he begin to preach? An awakening sermon, calling
                  on the Gentiles to repent of their sins? What sins? Shall he talk to the Spartan
                  of the wickedness of theft, or to the Corinthian of the wrong of worshipping
                  idols, of sacrificing to Venus? He is met by a morality alien in all things to his
                  own. The devout Corinthian religiously practices the very things most hateful to
                  Christianity. Where shall he find the one vulnerable opening? The resurrection of
                  the body. There is the one point, the tangible promise, all can appreciate and
                  feel. The Greek loved his body, and cherished it. He desired immortality, and
                  dreaded the gloomy Hades of shadows. The miracle attested the teacher. The promise
                  so sealed was all-powerful. Then came the inquiry how to obtain it. 'How shall I,'
                  asked the hearer, 'gain this new life?' 'Believe on the Lord Jesus is the answer.
                  'Who is, He?' asks<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7264-00000123"/> the disciple. He is
                  told—there you have the Creed—Believe, and be baptized.' 'I am ready for baptism.'
                  Repent, and forsake your old life.' Pie is ready enough for that also. The old
                  Creed is outworn; the gods are dead; the old faith is a jargon of philosophies, or
                  a tissue of legends. He is baptized. Into what? Into a living society, into an
                  order, into a community. Look at the dissensions of the Corinthian church, and you
                  will see what they presuppose. 'Were ye baptized into the name of Paul?' No, into,
                  the Christian Church, into allegiance to a person, into a kingdom. Then men put on
                  institutions which developed, of course, as numbers were added—that, of course—but
                  developed according to apostolic authority. 'The rest will set in
                     <emph>order</emph> when I come Here is a very living episcopate. And, if you
                  think this power personal to St. Paul, read his epistles to Timothy and Titus, and
                  see how the same rule was transmitted to them. Christianity could come only in a
                  tangible form—that of an institution. Take the next point. Could that institution
                  have varied with the different localities? Certainly not, in any essential,
                  radical points. There must have been everywhere the great leading features, since
                  there were affiliated societies, Men going from one to the other, contributions
                  passing to and fro, everywhere the same central facts, the sacraments, the Creed,
                  the ministry, all instituted by Christ himself. When out of the mutual antagonism
                  of Jew and Gentile there is trouble, the first General Council is called—to
                  arrange a concordat between different evangelical sects? No, to make a law for the
                  whole Church. Again, do you not see another necessity? There was but one safeguard
                  against transgression of Christian morality and discipline—excommunication. That
                  is powerless, upon your supposition. What would it amount to, if there existed no
                  body to be expelled from, or if a dozen other bodies stood ready to take up the
                  new member as a persecuted man? There was no general Christian sentiment as now;
                  leaving the community and making ecclesiastical censure not without effect even
                  among non-believers. One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, was the watchword of a
                  church, which must be at unity in order even to live, much more to grow."</p>
               <p>"Why, the great battle of St. Paul's life was to merge in one the Gentile and
                  Jewish elements. Now, I want you to do this, to show me when and where, and by
                  whom, this usurpation of episcopal authority of which you spoke came in. I give
                  you a dilemma you may take at your leisure. Either the churches were all from the
                  first episcopal, or since, as we know, and nobody ever did or could deny it, were
                  all such at the beginning of the third century. All other systems had proved such
                  manifest failures as to be abandoned by the universal consent of Christendom."</p>
               <p>Gardiner paused, and looked Maurice full in the face. The young man found himself
                  in the grasp of a logic too strong for him. "But," he said at last, "does not this
                  send me to that very Romanism from which you kept me? Why cannot the Catholic
                  retort all you have said upon you?" "Because I <emph>can</emph> do what I have
                  challenged you to do—put my finger upon every one of his corruptions. I show
                  where, when and how the Western Church ceased to be Catholic, and became papal. Is
                  it transubstantiation, celibacy of the clergy, worship of relics and images,
                  appeals to Rome, Virgin-worship? Anything we protest against, we do so, knowing
                  when it was not the faith of the Church, knowing, in most cases, when it crept
                  in." "But how about your apostolic succession? what proof have we that it still
                  exists, when there are a thousand probabilities that it has been broken?"</p>
               <p>"My young friend, have you ever examined that valuable problem which so bewilders
                  the unenlightened intellect—the one which arguing from the fact that every one
                  must have two parents, and each of these two parents, conclusively shows that each
                  man has infinite millions of ancestors? What is the answer? Why, that the lines
                  cross. Instead of there being one broadening track of succession, there are
                  multitudinous ones. You can't miss your road back, because all lead to it. Yours
                  is the Presbyterian theory, which admits breaks, and to which these would be
                  fatal. There may be constant failures of offspring in families, but races and
                  nations continue. The principle of Episcopal Consecration is its own safeguard.
                  Each bishop receives the succession through several others. That is one object of
                  the Episcopate. Suppose, for instance, I have been validly consecrated a bishop,
                  and ordain twenty or an hundred Presbyters and deacons. Some of these may be
                  improperly ordained and one such gets to be a<pb n="246-247"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000124"/> bishop. Can he vitiate the succession? No: his
                  brother bishops possess and transmit the power. The worst he can do will be to
                  vitiate the orders he himself confers on the lower clergy, who die out, and leave
                  the succession pure. We have also, as you will see when you are ordained a priest,
                  the added guaranty of presbyterial laying-on of hands. The fact is, the apostolic
                  succession in our Church has been but twice imperilled; and those times we know
                  about, they having been thoroughly ventilated by controversy. One was the
                  consecration of Archbishop Parker, after the death of Queen Mary; and the other,
                  that of the American bishops. In each case, we have the fullest admission of our
                  bitterest opponents, that the succession, though brought to a single link, was not
                  broken. Now, take this illustration. You stand at the mouth of the Mississippi;
                  you see the broad river emptying into the Gulf. You take up a drop from it. It is
                  said to you, 'How impossible to prove that this single drop can have had
                  communication with the source! There are two thousand miles from the source of the
                  Missouri, in the Rocky Mountains: you cannot see whence it comes.' You simply
                  answer, 'It is here.' Its presence is the best of proofs. If there was a break
                  anywhere, it could not have got to us. Remember it is not apostolic virtues, but
                  the apostolic office, that we claim. Good bishops or bad bishops make no
                  difference, Lord Macaulay, whom you have been reading, has misled you by confusing
                  the point. Now, if we should say, There are spots along the river where it could
                  have been cut off all you have to do is to go to them, and see why its flow was
                  not interrupted, how the mountain chain was cloven for its passage. So it is with
                  the succession. The Church knows it, because she has it. There are the Methodists
                  who profess the episcopal form; we point to their break, '<foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >ex nihilo, nihil fit.</foreign>' They deny the value of succession, or claim
                  it upon Presbyterian grounds, because John Wesley could not confer what he had not
                  himself. However if you want the records, you can have them in the Archbishops of
                  Canterbury to the very days of Augustine. Remember, that from the original
                  apostles went forth twelve streams of descent—thirteen if you count St. Paul in,
                  for Matthias took the place of Judas—which must have multiplied and recrossed
                  infinitely in the course of the first centuries; even so, that in every living
                  bishop to-day who has been validly consecrated is the succession of all the
                  apostles."</p>
               <p>Maurice had fired his last shot, and made his last stand. He sat silent and
                  thoughtful, yet not displeased. It was before him, the crisis of his fate. "What
                  shall I do?" was his thought; anything but yielding—and yet and yet it was right
                  to yield, only how should he save his dignity? "Give me a week," he said, "to
                  decide this." "Why should I give you anything?" replied Gardiner. "I have no right
                  to give you or refuse you. You own that you have failed to satisfy yourself. You
                  have asked for a better way: are you satisfied, or are you not? I cannot tell how
                  we stand, and therefore dare not advise. If you have been debating with me to gain
                  a support against your own doubts, I have no right to give you counsel: if you are
                  coming to me as a friend, I know what I should say. It is not time yet for me to
                  say that."</p>
               <p>"One thing more, at least, let me ask. You do not regard me as a minister, I see.
                  I do not quarrel with that; but, tell me, am I not so far a minister to myself,
                  that I ought not to relinquish that calling?" Gardiner was upon the point of
                  saying no, for he misapprehended the drift of Maurice's question; and, had he done
                  so, all would have gone wrong. But something in the young man's tone, something of
                  subdued feeling, caught his ear and he hesitated. With that subtle rapidity of
                  perception which he possessed beyond most men, he seemed to enter into the other's
                  thought. "If you mean," he said, "that, having proposed that work of serving
                  Christ as his minister, you have put your hand to the plough, and ought not to
                  look back, you are right. God forbid that I should hinder you. Only let me, if you
                  are satisfied that I see you are holding it with an unauthorized hand, and
                  ignorantly, take it from you, and put it rightly into your grasp." Maurice's face
                  flushed with joy. "Then your church will not reject me from its ministry?" "I know
                  no reason, if you believe her faith, accept her orders, and can answer her tests,
                  why you should be refused. You must give up your place here, of course. If you
                  will go to Broadwater, and study at the Cranmer School for six months, you can,
                  under the canon, be entitled, upon proper recommendations, to become a deacon, and
                  then a priest. I will give you a letter to my<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000125"/> friend, the Bishop of ——, who is now there in the
                  absence of the diocesan. He will at once baptize and confirm you, if you need
                  baptism. I should advise that in any case; for hypothetical baptism would settle
                  all doubts concerning the validity of your Unitarian baptism." "I have never had
                  even that. I remember asking about it of my parents. My father was not a
                  church-member, and my mother said she wished it; but our minister told her to
                  wait, and let me choose for myself when I grew up."</p>
               <p>"Very well, then; give me paper and a pen—thank you, a quill, if you have it, for
                  I hate these steel abominations' said Gardiner, in his cheery tones, relieved from
                  the graver accents in which the discussion had been held—"and I will write the
                  letter; and then, if your friend does not come by the train which I hear
                  whistling, you must come with me to Mr. ——'s, where I am staying, and I will give
                  you a copy of the canons you will need to consult, and also a little book I wish
                  you to look at, which will meet your case." He drew up to the table and began to
                  write. Maurice waited, and thought in silence. He was ready to draw back. This
                  friend was a young lawyer from the city, who had urged Maurice to throw up his
                  profession and go to the West with him, where he <emph>had</emph> secured a good
                  opening. Maurice had thought of it. He was now committed, yet longed to escape
                  from the net. If his friend did not come, he would hold the matter decided for
                  him. So he listened, and, while Gardiner's pen raced rapidly on, heard the train
                  arrive and departed, and, soon after, steps come and go, and carriages drive by
                  outside; and still no one came to his door. He got up at last, as Gardiner sealed
                  the letter and gave it him, and walked to the window with a long sigh of relief.
                  Then a great anxiety seized him, and he almost hurried Gardiner away, lest the
                  expected one might still arrive, after all; and, as they walked down the street,
                  he shrank nervously into the shadows at each passer-by from the direction of the
                  station. This may seem childish and foolish in him; but any one who has ever felt
                  the pressure of a great decision upon him knows how stranded and weak and helpless
                  the effort may leave him. When they reached Gardiner's stopping-place, they found
                  Maud De Forrest alone in the parlor. She laid down her book; Gardiner went
                  directly up stairs to his room, leaving Maurice. She looked up inquiringly, then
                  came forward, and put both hands in his. "I see how it is; I know it," she said:
                  "oh, how good God is to me!" and then she sat down on the sofa, and covered her
                  face with her hands to hide her tears. Then she left the room hastily, and did not
                  return. When Gardiner re-appeared, he had in his hand a little packet, in addition
                  to the things he had promised. "My niece wished me to give you this. Open it when
                  you get to Broad water. I suppose you cannot get away this week, but you had
                  better preach your last sermon and resign, and leave next Monday morning. You must
                  excuse Maud to-night; and, if you permit me to say it, excuse me also, for I leave
                  in the early train, and am very tired."</p>

               <p>THE next morning's post brought Maurice two letters. JL He opened the first, which
                  had a foreign post-mark, without looking at the other. The letter was from
                  Saltonstall Wise, and ran thus:—</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"MY DEAR OLD FELLOW:—So you have really kept true to your early purpose, and
                     are preaching in the wilds of Wooden-nutmegdom. So have not I. I think you must
                     have heard an absurd story of my seeking to rest upon the infallible bosom of
                     the one true Church. You write as if you had. I had half a mind to resist it.
                     My grandfather, as you know, came home, one evening in the days of his youth,
                     and turned half a tea-caddy full of prime Souchong out of his silver-buckled
                     shoes, which (the tea, not the shoes), in spite of the piteous wailings of his
                     mother and maiden aunts, he put into the fire, and then went to wash the
                     war-paint off his face. His grandfather assisted at the sacking of a Popish
                     mass-house at Pemaquid, or some such place, and with his own pious hands did
                     smash an ivory crucifix four feet high. His father, old Colonel Wise, was
                     present on duty at the occasion when the head of one William Laud, Archbishop
                     of Canterbury, was stricken off. Could a man with such antecedents go Rome
                     wards? Nevertheless, there is an ugly fact of truth in the rumor; and yet it is
                     not true. I did make profession, and was baptized by a priest. O, I wish I
                     could tell you what was then held out to me—visions of political advancement,
                     which were no delusions either, but based on most sure statistics. I don't
                     think I liked that. As a little boy, I always objected to take the lump of
                     sugar immediately after the medicine. It was mixing things not meant for each
                     other. It spoiled the sugar, and did not take away the bad taste. It
                        <emph>was</emph> a hard swallow, to put the whole thing down, Holy Father at
                     the Vatican and all; but I had done it, preferring any thing to the utterly
                     horrible feeling of having no belief, no religion, no Church, at all. So I
                     could not stand the discovery, that, after all my pains, I had only beer
                     promoting my interest in the kingdom of this world, especially when the
                     latter's paths were so very miry. You ask me—I can see you looking at me with
                     all your eyes—What am I now?' I am just nothing. This I feel sure of—that I
                     cannot well go back; and yet, if I chafed before, I feel like raving now. Do
                     you remember Browning's glorious myth which begins— <q>
                        <l>'Over the sea our galleys went?'</l>
                     </q> It is in 'Paracelsus.' Get it, and read it, and you will know how I feel.
                     But this is not why I write: it is to advise you, while there is time. You will
                     have to make your choice. You are not satisfied with Unitarianism: none of us,
                     who are good for aught, are. You will tire of your own experimenting, and then
                     you must go somewhere. Don't go to Rome: whatever else you do, not that. I used
                     to think our people were very foolish in their fears; that, if one could
                     believe that religion, it might do as well as another. I know better now. It is
                     just possible you may bring up in the Episcopal Church. If you can find rest
                     there, go to it I don't say that you can; but, if you can, don't let pride or
                     prejudice keep you out. You will have two things to contend against—you will
                     really lose position and profit, and your people will make you think, if they
                     can, they are led by interested motives. There are not thirty mitres in the
                     whole Church, I think; and fifteen of three years, are not desirable head-gear.
                     They drop in on an average of one in three years, and there are two thousand
                     clergy eligible to the vacancies. Nevertheless, if you go over, the first thing
                     our folks (I call them so from old habit) will tell you is, that you are hoping
                     to be made a bishop. The only thing that draws me at all toward these
                     Church-people, as they call themselves, is that their clergy work, and work
                     hard, and that in the least conspicuous and paying ways.</p>
                  <p>"For myself, I am going to retire from diplomacy; the more so because my worthy
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chef</foreign> will go out with the present
                     administration, and I have no fancy to stay here, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ad

                     to travel awhile; and then, Maurice, dear old boy, when I come home I shall try
                     to be whatever you are. I have put my faith utterly in you. If you are settled,
                     I will be taught and guided. It is awful earnest with me, so be very careful
                     what you do and decide."</p>

                  safe with it in his hands, so much did he dread his own weakness. He was not
                  tempted by its prospects. Nor did he ever think of accepting the call. That which
                  he dreaded was the reopening in his own mind of the old debate, whether he ought
                  not to give the thing a fuller trial. He was in a state of morbid
                  conscientiousness, for which action was the only relief. So he wrote;—</p>

                           <p>"MY DEAR BOY:—I am shocked and pained beyond measure that, with your
                              bright hopes and uncommon abilities, you should leave us for that
                              Church which, of all others, least recognizes the personal powers of
                              its ministers. I suppose yon have been allured by the idea of
                              advancement—that you may be a bishop. They won't make you one: such
                              things are not for converts who are too shaky. There is no body
                              wherein there is so much jealousy of outsiders as the Episcopal
                              Church. It is no place for a man of talent. It dwarfs and warps a
                              man's intellect, all that strict law which it observes. After two
                              generations of it, men really seem to run out. All the prominent posts
                              in it, nearly, seem to be filled by men who have come into it from
                              other denominations. ['I <emph>should</emph> like to reconcile your
                              two propositions, Dr. Hooper,' said Maurice to himself]. Don't go into
                              this thing. People will say at once that you are run out, and fit for
                              nothing better. You will be lost, swallowed up, in that Church. They
                              bury a man in a country parsonage, and leave him to starve. The
                              Methodists push all their rising men, the Baptists stick like Highland
                              clansmen one to another, but the Episcopalians will let you work all
                              your life, and then think you paid by a D. D. from any twopenny
                              college. By the way, you'll never get the degree from Harvard now. Of
                              course, they have flattered you, and will do it. They have so few men
                              of note, that real talent like yours will be a very great treasure. It
                              is so ridiculous in you to cut yourself off from all your old friends.
                              Besides, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entre nous,</foreign> you ought not
                              to leave us now, if you do by and by. There is a current—a sort of
                              temporary fancy, perhaps—among us setting that way; and, if we were to
                              come in as a body, you know, bringing the wealth and intellect of New
                              England with us, we might make terms, such as we never shall get if we
                              go singly. If I were at liberty to tell you of all the brethren who
                              have thought of this thing, you might be startled. But we shall hold
                              on, though some of the young men are shaky. But do be resolute: take
                              this call. I've not sent in your letter. In a couple of years, you may
                              be very glad.</p>

                              of their bishops, I wish you would learn this for me. I am under the
                              impression that they recognize the Roman-Catholic orders. Why could
                              you not be made a priest abroad, and then come to the Episcopal
                              Church? They would think twice as much of you. It is the way

               <p>"Bravo, Doctor! you have thought enough about it, it seems, to have found Mrs. H.
                  an obstacle,"-said Maurice to himself, as he laid down this second letter. Then he
                  wrote a brief reply:—</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"MY DEAR DOCTOR.—<emph>My</emph> mind is made up. If <emph>you</emph> are
                     thinking of the same thing—and I must say your letter reads so—all I can say
                     is, go at once, and by the straight road."</p>
               </q>
               <p>It is easier to advise than to act. Maurice did not go the straight or the short
                  road; but out of Unitarianism and its ministry he was determined to go. He sat
                  clown and wrote his farewell sermon. At the close of the morning service, on the
                  following Sunday, he briefly stated his resignation, and that his farewell sermon
                  would be in the evening. His little chapel was crammed, even to aisles and
                  doorways. He felt under a strange excitement. He had tried to put the ease calmly
                  and dispassionately, but the effort to do so forced him into plainer talk than he
                     had<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7264-00000128"/> ever before used. It was in
                  marked contrast to the showy and vague style he had been drifting into. There was
                  breathless silence as he told his flock that he was satisfied that no Divine
                  commission could be given him by congregational forms or from their own body; that
                  their faith was wanting in essential elements, and was a compromise of dexterous
                  concealments; and that the liberty of believing as one pleased was a delusion and
                  a snare.</p>
               <p>He took his text from the book of Judges, from the story of Micah and his idols.
                  He drew a spirited picture of the lawless Israel when there was no king, and every
                  man did that which was right in his own eyes; and he then applied this, with a
                  severity of which he hardly himself felt the force, to those theories of a "Church
                  of the future" which he had once indulged in.</p>
               <p>His people went out of the church cowed and stunned. In after days they woke up to
                  a hurt and angry feeling. Some drifted away into other bodies; but the original
                  Universalist element, which had been kept down by his Harvard Unitarianism,
                  revived, and they called an out-and-out Universalist, and the society droned on
                  under a half-educated man, who ran no risk of being borne away by what the
                  womankind of the parish considered the main cause of Maurice's perversion—the
                  Episcopalian parties in the great houses of Norowam. Let us leave them in peace:
                  our story concerns them no more.</p>
               <p>Maurice did not care to linger in Norowam. He could not determine to go to Broad
                  water yet: he felt the inaction and lassitude which follows intense strain of mind
                  and purpose. So he packed up his things, and started for a brief summer ramble. He
                  found himself landed at nightfall at the Massasoit in Springfield, from which
                  place he intended to go to Northampton the next day, and then loiter up the
                  Connecticut Valley to the White Mountains. He found the hotel crowded. The halls
                  and parlors were swarming with young men. There was a familiar look and tone to
                  them which struck his attention while he was waiting at the clerk's desk. It was
                  some time before that functionary could attend to him; but, when he did, it was
                  not very satisfactory. His words were brief, as of a man in the midst of great
                  events. "Sorry, sir; but, unless you wrote a week ago, you've no chance;
                  everything is taken. We turned off fifty to-night!" "What's the matter?" was
                  Maurice's reply. "Crowninshield, Endicott; seventy-three. Yes, all right. John,
                  take those gentlemen's things to seventy-three," said the clerk. Then to Maurice
                  again, "Beg your pardon, sir; but the college regatta to-morrow on the river. Yale
                  stops at the United States; Harvard stops here; all full. If you are Harvard, you
                  may find some friend who can give you a room; I can do nothing for you. If you're
                  Yale, you had better go down to the other house." Just then, Maurice felt his hand
                  seized, and violently shaken. "Bryan, old boy! you here! that's glorious! We'll
                  take care of you, if you can stand a shake-down on the floor. Our class has No.
                  17. You won't get much sleep. We're rather old birds to be here; but then, for the
                  sake of the boating interest, some of us always turn out to the regattas, and,
                  this is a special affair. Come in and get your supper. Five of the fellows came in
                  the Boston train—Sears, Howe, Morton, Keyes, and Pepper Osgood: that, with you,
                  and me, and Fred Tilton, will make eight of us. Here, waiter, show us the
                  dining-room." So rattled on an old classmate, and Maurice found himself borne off
                  into the large dining-room, usually, at that hour,' here and there dotted with
                  silent travellers, enacting the solemn rites of the evening sacrifice to nightmare
                  and dyspepsia, but which now buzzed with noise and laughter. He was greeted warmly
                  by his old classmates, now, like himself, entered upon manhood, but rejoicing in
                  this brief return to the frolic and boyishness of university days. The talk was
                  mainly upon the one absorbing topic. "Where is our crew? any of them here?" asked
                  one. "Oh, no! they are snug in bed, and two of the Sophs on guard that nobody
                  disturbs them, or smuggles in a cigar or a drink. They have been in training—let
                  me see, since the May exhibition—and you can just fancy how, at the last moment,
                  they must long to break over. Won't they go it, by this time to-morrow night!"</p>
               <p>Opposite Maurice's party at the table were a number of the undergraduates, whose
                  talk was livelier than even that of their elders. "I say, Ned, I've just come up
                  from the States. I went to get a squint at their crew, and fell in with some of
                  the Yale men. I booked a couple of bets; I've got five to three from them, so they
                  are bound to crow to the last.<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7264-00000129"/> I was
                  ready to go even, but they would give me no chance. Think they are trying to
                  bluff?" "No, no, not between colleges. What's the use? a man bets for his college
                  all he can spare, and takes the risk; it isn't the money. How are their boats? I
                  hear they have gone to the best New York builders. Hang boats; it's the men that
                  do it. We always have won, and we mean to to-morrow." "Shells, I suppose?" "I
                     <emph>should</emph> think so. Why, they are as thin as a paper nautilus, and
                  the men have to use hooks and eyes instead of buttons; a button off would spoil
                  the time." The speaker emphasized this remark by the pop of a champagne cork,
                  echoed back from various parts of the room; and even the waiters were drawn into
                  the excitement, and, being seized by strong and active hands, submitted to be
                  decorated with the red rosette of Harvard. Maurice's party speedily withdrew to
                  their own room, preferring to keep their reunion more quietly. Sleep was out of
                  the question till long after midnight. From the dining-room came up the notes of
                  many a song, and the cheers and laughter; and, older and graver though they were,
                  these elder graduates had much lively talk to get through. However, they went at
                  last to their cots.</p>
               <p>Fair and clear rose the morning. The race was to come off at six in the afternoon.
                  Maurice found no time to be alone, nor did he wish it. It was a great relief to
                  him to plunge into the midst of the gay talk and jolly liveliness of the young men
                  around him. There is, moreover, about Harvard a wonderful continuity of descent.
                  You meet a class five years younger than your own, and the brothers of your
                  classmates are on its roll. Twenty years, and the sons of the dear old fellows are
                  beginning to come up to the Freshman examination. Thirty years, and you are
                  sitting on the platform, very choky about the throat, and moist as to the
                  spectacles, as a young gentleman of your own name answers to the "expectatur
                  dissertatio" of the president. So that whenever Harvard men meet, in spite of
                  disparity of years, they are sure to find common ground somewhere. Maurice was
                  introduced to the two crews, and could not but admire the noble young fellows,
                  with their frank, open faces, and joyous, larking ways and talk. There was a most
                  healthy realism in it all. One or two of the old professors appeared in the course
                  of the day—<foreign xml:lang="FRA">en</foreign>
                  <foreign xml:lang="FRA">route</foreign> for somewhere else, they said,—who shyly
                  drew up to the groups, talking shop-talk, as is the wont of professors when
                  stranded upon the shoals of undergraduate life, but showing, in a quiet way,
                  scarcely less interest. The sultry afternoon wore on, and at length a fresh breeze
                  swept down from the region where Holyoke faces Tom, cooling the air and crisping
                  the broad river-reach. By half-past five, the banks were crowded; all Springfield
                  seemingly turning out to enjoy the spectacle. The Harvard boats, sent down by
                  rail, were carefully placed in the water. The crews took their seats with grim
                  earnestness, and then, with beautiful precision, the result of long practice,
                  pulled slowly but steadily down to the starting-place. The Yale boat, and another
                  from one of the minor colleges, were getting under way from the opposite bank.
                  There was much criticism passed upon them, in low tones, by the Harvard men. There
                  was more of flourish, and loud-voiced command: a simple sign or a quiet word had
                  been all the Cambridge captains permitted themselves to use. Yale showed something
                  of flurry, which boded ill. As the headmost boat shot out into the stream, a voice
                  from the bank called out loud and clear, "Now Yale!" and a ringing cheer went up
                  from the eager hundreds of young men. Their coxswain called out hoarsely, "Way
                  enough! toss!" and the cheer was acknowledged by a returning salute. "That gives
                  us the race, boys!" cried a quick-sighted Harvard man at Maurice's side. "That
                  fellow knows no better than to tire his crew by a useless flourish at the start.
                  It will take him half-way to the ground to get them into good stroke again, and
                  every minute of breathing-time there is precious. Yale pulls too quick: wait till
                  we settle to our long stroke, and you'll see." There was a period of restless,
                  breathless suspense. Far below could be seen the flash of Harvard's oars; and then
                  the boats rounded to, and lay motionless, black points in the river, slightly
                  nearer the eastern shore. Then Yale and the fourth boat reached the spot. Minutes
                  seemed hours as they got into line. All eyes were gazing down the stream. Then
                  came a flash and puff of white smoke, from the bank below, and then the moments of
                  growing, culminating fever of attention. Presently went up from the further bank
                  the cry of "Yale! Yale!" first from solitary voices high up upon the roofs of
                     houses,<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7264-00000130"/> whence the keen-eyed
                  watchers, from their perilous perches, could see the position of the boats, then
                  caught up by the crowd beneath, and then dying away in the breathless doubt of the
                  struggle. "Wait till our stroke tells!" muttered the men around Maurice; and then
                  suddenly was heard from below a solitary shout of "Har-vard!" and Maurice fancied
                  he could see a gap between the boats. One was certainly tailing the rest, which
                  one he could not tell. 'Most every hand now held a watch, and eager eyes were
                  glancing from the dial-plates to the gleaming river. And now they could see the
                  rise and fall of the bending backs, and the swift roll of the oars flashing and
                  feathering in one sweep. "Hurrah for the long stroke!" cried a looker-on, and then
                  the murmur swelled into a cheer and shouting up toward the goal, amid the cries of
                  "Well done, Y. Y.!" "Harvard! Harvard!" The university boat led right gallantly
                  the way. "Give way, Y. Y.! fifty for ever!" was the cry of many voices, as more
                  practiced eyes than Bryan's saw that pressing the champion boat hard came the
                  brave little four-oars. The Yale boat seemed to lap on the quarter of the Y. Y.;
                  but, as the leading boat came abreast, all could see a mighty gap, not to be
                  closed: and then, amid such cheering as drowned every other sound, the Harvard
                  crews rested on their oars beyond the goal, Yale pulled gallantly to the last, but
                  hopelessly, while the fourth boat, abandoning the utterly vain attempt, was
                  steered into the shore; and the Harvard bowman unfurled and placed in the bow the
                  little champion-flag of crimson silk for which so much endurance and courage had
                  contended. The landing was a tumult of triumphant delight. The strong young
                  fellows, dripping with perspiration, were hustled into their overcoats, and not
                  permitted to set foot upon the ground, but were hoisted upon the linked arms of
                  their comrades, and borne in triumph to their hotel. It was a Babel of voices;
                  every one was telling of the time, the incidents, of the race: while Yale more
                  quietly gathered in a dense crowd upon the other side of the river; not forgetting
                  to raise a hearty cheer of congratulation to the rival and victor college, which
                  was manfully responded to, in all the generous enthusiasm of success, by the young
                  men of Harvard.</p>
               <p>Maurice turned quietly away from the river's margin. Now, that the furor of the
                  race was over, his thoughts came back to himself. He felt that he was no longer
                  young, that life was other than, a summer holiday for him, and he strolled away to
                  the hill which the Arsenal crowns, in a deep reverie. A strange sympathy came over
                  him for the losing side. He too, he thought, as he sat upon the hill-top and
                  watched the gorgeous melting of the sunset clouds—he too had pulled in his race,
                  and lost. He slowly started homewards past the United States Hotel. Little groups
                  of long-haired Yale students were standing on the sidewalk, and they looked at him
                  as he passed, jealously watching for some glance of triumph which might be
                  resented. Whether they saw no such signs, as he slowly loitered by, or were
                  restrained by the natural instinct of gentlemanliness, he could not tell, but they
                  went on with their talk as before.</p>
               <p>"Well, boys," said one, "we're beaten this time; but, if training will do it,
                  we'll have that champion-flag in New Haven harbor yet." "Yes," said another,
                  "that's so: it is poor pluck that gives up at one beat." The words sank deep into
                  Maurice's mind. He remembered that he had a classmate living in Springfield, and
                  went into a shop to learn of his abode. That was soon found; and, at the very gate
                  of the pretty little house, he met his friend. Maurice was warmly greeted, taken
                  into the house and presented to his friend's wife, a bright, lovely little woman,
                  who wore conspicuously the Harvard colors. They kept him to tea; and, over that
                  social meal, the chat flowed freely. "You are a Unitarian minister somewhere in
                  Connecticut, they told me. I thought you would have gone into the law," said his
                  friend. "I was that," replied Maurice. He had changed his clerical-cut coat he
                  wore in Norowam, for a light summer-sack, and had put on a blue neck-tie, so the
                  question was hesitatingly asked, and a look of surprise came over the wife's face.
                  "I was that; but I have left the Unitarians." "I wonder if you had as good a
                  reason as I had," said his host, glancing across the table to his wife, who
                  smiled, and blushed a little, and then said, "Will has a better reason than me, I
                  hope, though I did take him with me to church." "Well, I am satisfied now, any
                  way; but how was it with you, if I may ask?" "I am afraid I have had no such good
                  reason," said Maurice; "at least [with a bow to the<pb n="260-261"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000131"/> lady] not so fair a temptation. I have left
                  Unitarianism because I have tried it, and found it wanting. And now I am adrift. I
                  have thought—I wish I could make up my mind—that I should go to Broadwater to
                  study for the Episcopal Church." "O Mr. Maurice, do! I am sure you ought. I
                     <emph>know</emph> you will never feel contented till you do." "But, deary,
                  perhaps Mr. Maurice does not feel ready to take such a responsibility." "Why not?
                  he <emph>has</emph> taken it already. It is his work: he must not give it up; it
                  is settled for him. The only thing is in what way to do it—the right way or the
                  wrong." "You see, Maurice, my wife (woman-like) cannot think any way but her own
                  the right." "Well, now, isn't it?" said she. Maurice smiled; but twice that day a
                  casual word had-hit him hard. He went back to the Massasoit at ten. The noise and
                  fun was at its height, a grand supper was in progress, and from the dining-hall
                  came the roar of sturdy choruses, and then a rich voice trolling out a solo,
                  followed with cheers, and the jingle of glass, and shouts of laughter. There are
                  black sheep in every flock, and weakness of the flesh, and foolish young fellows
                  who will be led into excess. As Maurice passed through the hall, he met a party of
                  undergraduates. They were helping one of their number up to bed. The fair young
                  face was all flushed and stupid with drink, and the athletic, manly limbs all
                  relaxed. Maurice saw it with a pained feeling. He knew that such things would be,
                  and that one outbreak did not necessarily mean the ruin of the boy, who would
                  probably wake well shamed on the morrow; but he was saddened by the sight. He felt
                  that which, the first time we do feel it, comes with a very chilling sense—the
                  power of worldliness; not what is usually meant by worldliness in sermons and
                  essays, but the real spell of the world. Here was all this gay life around
                  him—this hearty, happy animation, with all its redeeming traits, too, of chivalric
                  pluck and gentlemanliness and honor, and even its excesses, which were not
                  deep-seated evils, and what was it worth?</p>
               <p>He sat thinking it over in his room. He was not disposed to take the Puritan view
                  at all. He did not believe renunciation of the world meant giving up anything
                  intended for our use and enjoyment. He admitted this boat-race, even with its
                  fringe of dissipation as good and healthy in its way. But he felt the contrast of
                  the life he had half-purposed to himself to return to, with such a life as
                  Winthrop was leading. It was not in itself bad, but it needed that it should be
                  infused with the strong leaven of a downright, uncompromising Christian,
                  principle. He now saw clearly, for the first time, the worth and the value of the
                  ministerial office. It was to be a work in the world; not a Sunday work, but among
                  men. There flashed upon his soul the opposing sides of the day's experience—its
                  tendencies downwards, its coarse, degrading possibilities; its ennobling, hopeful,
                  purifying opportunities. He felt the want of his own influence in the scale of
                  right. All this culture, all this training of body and mind, was a great fallow
                  field. The end of life was not running boat-races or enjoying triumphs. He saw his
                  life-work before him, and he knew that the old seaman's words to him were true—he
                  had been saved from the wild waves of the Newfoundland Banks to do God service in
                  his church. Had he found that church? It seemed to him that he had done so. No one
                  could deal with these young men unless possessed of an admitted authority. He had
                  seen in Winthrop the ministry of a church which acted with power. He had felt the
                  difference in the bearing of young men toward him and toward his friend. He saw
                  the cause of his own failures. He determined to take the morning train for
                  Broadwater.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <p>THE morning after the boat-race, a classmate, whom Maurice met at the
                  breakfast-table brought him news of some changes in his probable position in life.
                  He had inherited a comfortable estate, and had never been required to give any
                  other care to it than simply to receive and spend his dividends. He now learnt
                  that, through the fraud of its president, the manufacturing company in which a
                  large part of his property was invested was on the brink of failure. It was feared
                  that, by a series of adroit forgeries, the stockholders were to be made
                  individually liable. He had to hurry to Boston. For two months' time his life was
                  wholly changed. He was compelled to pass his days in dusty and hot offices, in
                  consultation with lawyers. At one time, he was in hourly expectation of having to
                  begin the world anew, with nothing but the clothes in his trunk, his own head and
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"If the worst come to the worst," said his lawyer to him one of these dark days,
                  "I will take you into my" office and give you the best chance I can; but the
                  ministry will be out of the question." Maurice never knew how much this was to
                  him, till it seemed out of his reach. He mentally resolved to seek a clerkship,
                  and to earn his daily bread while studying fir the six months required. At length,
                  however, light broke. Through his own shrewd mastery of the details of a very dark
                  transaction, he was enabled to trace the disposition of the embezzled property.
                  The company came out of the trial sorely crippled, without hope of making a
                  dividend under two or three years. He was offered a place in its employ at a very
                  tempting salary. One great gain he had made; he had conquered his dreamy,
                  balancing temper to a great extent, had gained an insight into the practical
                  business life of the world. He had learned economy too; to live simply, and to
                  deny himself. He asked and obtained leave, at the final meeting of the directors,
                  when the winding-up of the affair was reached, to consider for one week their
                  proposal, and then, once more, he took up the line of life which for two months he
                  had dropped.</p>
               <p>"We shall have you back with us soon," said one of his friends. "You have too good
                  a brain to be buried in the pettinesses of a country parsonage."</p>
               <p>Bryan felt the force of this; he had a just pride in his own success; he had felt,
                  too, the charm of business enterprise, but not yet its weariness. But he had also,
                  in another's fall, seen the awful temptation which besets the American business
                  life. He had looked into the vortex of that dreadful maelstrom, "stock
                  speculation;" he had seen the shipwrecks and ghastly drowned faces looking up from
                  that wild whirl. He knew in his soul that he that maketh haste to be rich maketh
                  to himself sin. Strong as was the allurement of material activities, a stronger
                  spell lay upon him in the unopened letter which day by clay he had carried in his
                  bosom, and in the hopes sown by that fair river, amid the western hills of
                  New-England. So, asking for his week, he rose up and went his way in feverish
                  impatience, and yet checked by the clinging pressure of the past.</p>
               <p>The summer had ended when Maurice trod again the streets of Broad water. The
                  beautiful old town seemed, as it always seems, unchanged from its sleepy quietude.
                  It was night when he arrived, however, and this must pass for an after
                  recognition. He only knew then that he went straight to the hotel, and, tired with
                  travel, made no attempt to visit the Divinity School that night. He had taken with
                  him sundry papers, which yet required to be gone over, and which he had calculated
                  he could attend to before bed-time. But he was too sleepy, and, after nodding over
                  them for half an hour, he gave it up and went to bed. The consequence was, that he
                  did not stir out the next morning, but was putting the last paper into his valise
                  as the gong of the Decatur House rung for dinner.</p>
               <p>That over, he sallied forth. At the hotel-door the attack of irresolution came
                  back upon him once more, fiercer than ever. He strolled up to the hills above
                  Broadwater. He found himself at the gate of a cemetery. He went in along the
                  winding path that led to the monument, idly taking<pb n="264-265"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000133"/> notice of all things in the effort to stay the
                  tumult of his thoughts. The moment for decision had come, and yet he was wanting
                  to it. The fact that he felt a doubt seemed to press heavily against him. What
                  business had he to be hesitating? He sat weariedly down upon the summit, and
                  looked around over the lovely landscape, in the first russet changes of its
                  autumnal beauty, Beneath lay Broadwater, buried in its elms. Westward, like the
                  ridgy back of a long wave, rising with the shoreward "sene" of the ground-swell,
                  just ere it curls and breaks, against the horizon, he could trace the crest of the
                  Hoveden Hills. To the eastward shone the silver reaches of the winding river. Far
                  to the north, a dim blue cloud against the sky-line marked a well-known mountain
                  in a neighboring State. He looked down into a mass of groves, and the four
                  chimneys of a stately mansion-house peeped out—one of the old family seats of the
                  aristocratic heart of the State. He noted all, lingering on each point with
                  leisurely distinctness, as one trying to escape the pressure of importunate
                  thought; but his eye would come back slowly yet inevitably to the square
                  observatory of the Cranmer School building.</p>
               <p>He had come expressly to Broadwater to find rest for his irresolution, and now he
                  was minded to flee from the haven where he would be. He caught sight of the smoke
                  of a steamer upon the river. It was the boat for New York. He half rose from his
                  seat upon the grass, in the impulse to go down to the landing, and take passage in
                  her for the city. He put his hand in his pocket, to see if he had his wallet with
                  him, and his grasp met Gardiner's letter. Another one was with it. It was the
                  written offer of the Chesun-cook Falls Manufacturing Company, to him, to take
                  their sub-agency, with the promise of the chief place in a year, and a salary of
                  —— thousand dollars, with perquisites and prospects unlimited. The week was not
                  up. Dr. Hopper he had seen in Boston, and he had said that the pulpit offered to
                  Maurice was still vacant. He could reach the wharf in time, or, failing that, take
                  the night train. He laid the two letters side by side before him, on the grass,
                  and watched the approaching column of smoke. Let not the reader unacquainted with
                  such mental trials despise this conflict. Reason and study had convinced him; but
                  reason and study are powerless, when the mystery of the soul's perplexity, as to
                  absolute right and wrong, in personal decision, comes upon us. He felt the one
                  thing for him to do was to sit still: it was literally "his strength to sit
                  still." Desperately he sat there upon the hill-top, watching the approaching boat,
                  from which he could not take his eyes, till he could see her swiftly bearing down
                  past the quarries of Sandiland, and gliding behind the island-screen of drooping
                  willow-boughs, upon the hither side of the river-channel. He watched her till she
                  reached the wharf: even then it was not too late. She might stop a half-hour for
                  freighting, and he get aboard. Ten minutes more would take him to the pier, and
                  then a letter would reclaim his valise, and discharge his bill. He all but clung
                  to the short grass to keep his place. After all—the thought came to him—staying
                  where he was, decided nothing. He would not be compelled to enter the school
                  because the boat left him.</p>
               <p>He turned sharply round, as if the thought stung him. He looked no more toward
                  Broadwater, but gazed fixedly at the Hoveden Hills, as if he would imprint their
                  outline upon his memory, until he heard the faint toll of the steamboat-bell. Then
                  he-stood lip, and I saw her drive with gathering speed past the lower buildings of
                  the town, and swing out into the broad reach toward the gorge beyond. Then he
                  walked, with deliberate but firm steps, down the hill toward the Divinity School.
                  The tone of his mind-came back as he reached its northern entrance. He had now a
                  practical embarrassment, to find those of whom he was in search, and he was
                  himself again. The life he had been leading seemed to come to his aid, and he
                  bethought himself of the necessary steps to make his errand known. He went
                  straight up the stairs, meeting no one, to the little ante-room before the chapel,
                  thinking to wait until some one appeared. To his surprise, he found it changed.
                  The altar was no longer there, but only a chair and table in its place. The
                  lectern had disappeared, and only a few little tables were standing in front of
                  the seats. The door of one of the adjoining rooms opened, and a young man came
                  out. Maurice, without speaking, put into his hand his card and the letter which
                  Gardiner had given him. The young man glanced at the address, and then said, "The
                  Bishop of —— is now in the study; walk in here, sir, and he will see you." Maurice
                  entered a small chamber, partially screened off to<pb n="266-267"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000134"/> form a sleeping-room, and passed through into a
                  large and nobly proportioned apartment. Upon the dark-crimson papered walls were
                  hung various prints and engravings. One side was entirely lined with well-filled
                  book-shelves. A large study-table was in the centre; a small table, heaped with
                  papers and the confused litter of a busy man's working-room, occupied a corner.
                  Various broad and comfortable chairs stood invitingly about. The large
                  French-folding sashes of the east window were open, and a pleasant breeze came
                  fluttering in. A gentleman rose from his seat, by the little table, to greet him.
                  He was of middle height, with black, curling hair, just touched here and there
                  with gray. He was stouter and shorter than Gardiner, erect, and with a dash and
                  mobility of movement, and a quick play of features, which were clear cut, and
                  conveyed an assurance more of energy than of reserved power. His smile was
                  singularly pleasant; and, as he took the letter and card, he motioned Maurice to a
                  seat. He read the letter almost at a glance, threw it on the table, and, starting
                  up, held out both hands to Maurice, clasping his with a warm pressure.</p>
               <p>"I am delighted to see you," he said, "and your mind is made up, is it? I judge so
                  by your coming to us. Thank God, thank God, for it. Gardiner writes to me every
                  thing good about you. I had a letter from him last night, anxiously inquiring
                  about you, and saying that your place should be ready in the school as soon as you
                  came. And you desire, of course, Holy Baptism first? Mr. Vincent—the Rev. Mr.
                  Vincent, Mr. Maurice—will you be good enough to see that the font is ready, and to
                  get out my robes, there in my trunk, in my chamber? And now, my dear fellow, we
                  must have your confirmation to follow. I am acting here while the Bishop is away,
                  and have his full authority. You are really determined, are you? Sit down, and
                  tell me all you want to say."</p>
               <p>Vincent had left the room, and the two were alone. The kindly, earnest manner of
                  the Bishop fairly opened Maurice's heart, strained, as it was, with the long
                  emotion of his mental conflict. He could only murmur a few incoherent words:
                  "Thank you, thank yon, Bishop;" and then he bowed his face on his hands. The
                  Bishop laid one hand gently on his shoulder, and then waited for self-control to
                  come back. Then Maurice lifted up his head. His eyes were tearless and his mouth
                  firm. "I came here," he said, "to ask for Baptism only, to lay aside my old
                  heresies, to resign myself into the hands of my only Lord. I have tried and failed
                  as a minister. I know not whether I ought to ask more than this; even to be
                  confirmed, to become a communicant, seems too much." "No: it is not too much. We
                  will not hurry you, but indeed your failure was not your fault. I have heard a
                  great deal about you from one who knew you well. She—eh—well, that person," said
                  the good Bishop, slightly confused, "assures me that you can do the Church noble
                  service. Your work failed, because it was not built on any thing strong or stable.
                  I judge that you failed, because you worked too well,—too much like a Churchman.
                  Winthrop has the greatest admiration for you. If you see your mistake now,—that
                  your belief was wrong and your work outside the church instead of in it,—why
                  should not you take a new start?" "I feel so weak, so doubtful of myself." "That
                  is just as you ought to feel; but do you not think you arc called to the work of
                  the ministry?" "I thought so once; when I was saved from the wreck of the Mystic I
                  vowed myself to that. Oh, if I could have only come here then! These lost years!
                  These lost years!" "My dear young friend, not lost; you have had training, you
                  have gained experience, you have learned that it is not theories but convictions
                  which succeed; you are better fitted for our ministry, instead of being worse
                  fitted, by what you have gone through. Every clergyman makes some failures and
                  blunders; I wish I could have made mine upon Unitarians. But we won't speak of
                  what is to come yet. You are ready and desirous to be baptized, seeking therein
                  remission of sins, and to profess your faith in Christ, God as your only Saviour?"
                  "Indeed and indeed I am." "And you would not shrink from owning that faith before
                  men, and trying to live according to it?" "I would not," said Maurice, "God
                  helping me;" and his eye, full of sad earnestness, was lifted to meet the gaze of
                  the other. "And you would not shrink from those means and helps which will give
                  you strength to keep your vows. If the Lord were on earth, and bade you come to
                  Him, you would not turn away?" "I hope not," said Maurice. "Then you will not
                  refuse the invitation, the offer He<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7264-00000135"/>
                  makes of himself invisibly through the Sacrament?" "If I may,—I do not know,—it is
                  too much to think of now." "Well, I will not press you; you must want time for
                  preparation. Yet, if it were only Maundy Thursday, we might unite all the
                  services. It is almost a pity," said the Bishop, whose enthusiastic love for the
                  Church led him to make the most of her rites. "However, perhaps it is best as it
                  is. We have evening service at seven to-night in the Chapel, instead of the usual
                  hour. I have two or three others to confirm, two of the school from my own
                  diocese, who were brought up Congregationalists. And now sit here, my dear boy, as
                  long as you like; but please excuse me, as I am much engaged till then. Would you
                  prefer to be alone? I am sure the ladies would be glad to have you join us at tea;
                  but, judging from my own feeling, I thought you would rather not meet any one till
                  after the service." "Thank you, Bishop. I should very much prefer being alone till
                  then' The Bishop put a little manual of devotional preparation into his hands and
                  left him. Maurice sat for some time busily reading it and striving to control the
                  current of his thoughts. Doubts, questions, the errors of his past days,
                  self-distrust, all manner of perplexities, came to beset and bewilder him; Yet
                  clearer and clearer was the firm resolution to go on. He closed the book. He took
                  from his pocket the little Prayer-book which had belonged to Frank, and the packet
                  which Maud had given him. He remembered he was to read it then. He broke the seal;
                  it contained a brief portion of a letter and some verses. The fragment of the
                  letter was in Frank's handwriting, and was as follows:—</p>
               <p>"And now, dear Maud, I have resolved to give myself to God. I do not take this
                  step, that I may be more worthy of you, though I pray for that continually, but
                  because, as you have taught me, it is right. I shall be confirmed next Thursday,
                  at Grace Church in the City, not waiting for the Bishop to come to Cambridge. May
                  God help me to keep my vows!" The rest of the letter vas torn off! Upon the back
                  of this, fragment was, in Maud's hand, this indorsement: "All that remains to me
                  of my dear, dear Frank." The verses were in Maud's writing; but, as Maurice read
                  them, he felt they were not her own. We give them as they were:—<q>

               </p>
               <p>The only other thing in the parcel was a note addressed as follows: "To my brother
                  in the Lord, Bryan Maurice, to be opened after his Baptism."</p>
               <p>He replaced the papers hastily, as the opening of the door startled him. It was
                  not the Bishop, but the young clergyman whom he had met at first. "The Bishop sent
                  me to say to you, sir," he began, "that perhaps you would like to go into the
                  Chapel before the rest, and I will take you in." Maurice understood the thoughtful
                  kindness of the act. He would gladly have passed some of the time in prayer; but
                  in a strange room, where he dreaded interruption, his New England shyness
                  interposed. "Is the Chapel far?" he asked. "It used to be in the house." "Far! Oh,
                  no! you can see it from here," and he stepped to a side window and pointed.
                  Maurice looked out. Across a little grassy quadrangle, one side open to the
                  street, itself forming the south side, was an exquisite little building, built
                  from the red sandstone of the neighboring quarries. It had arisen since Maurice's
                  former visit to Broadwater. Its sharp roof was covered with many kinds of colored
                  slates. Midway of the nave rose a little pointed bell-cote, in front of which
                  projected a porch of open-work, screening the entrance.</p>
               <p>"That is the new chapel," said Vincent; "shall we go to it?" He led the way by a
                  different staircase from that by which Maurice had entered, descending into the
                  body of the<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7264-00000136"/> house. Maurice caught a
                  glimpse of a broad hall and stately suit of rooms, and he heard the sound of
                  ladies' voices. He shrank from meeting any one, and was relieved to follow his
                  guide along an outer passage, an enclosed piazza, sashed and glazed, which served
                  as a cloister to lead to the quadrangle, They crossed this, and reached the little
                  porch. Vincent unlocked it, and said, "It is now near six. I will lock the door,
                  if you like, and then you cannot be disturbed till just before seven, when Martin
                  comes to light up and ring the bell." He held out his hand, saying, "I trust to
                  welcome you here soon," and Maurice felt there was kindly sympathy in the
                  pressure. "You will find a seat on that side," he added, pointing to some low open
                  forms, and then withdrew. Maurice could not but look about him.</p>
               <p>The little building, for it was small, was exquisite in proportions and
                  adornments. The roof was of illuminated panels of gold and ultramarine, relieved
                  with vermilion. The rafters were disclosed with color-decorations along their
                  chamfered edges. The chancel-roof was sprinkled with golden stars. In the centre
                  of its apse was a high window, with a very lovely full-length picture of the
                  Saviour walking on the sea. Beneath was the altar, richly vested in an altar-cloth
                  of dark-lined velvet, with the sacred Monogram embroidered on the centre. Midway
                  of the nave ran a transverse passage, and the eastern part was raised a single
                  step, for a choir," with a triple row of stalls on either side like an English
                  College Chapel. West of the passage were plain open forms, facing the chancel. The
                  windows of the nave were slender lancets, with cusped heads; two of them were
                  adorned with armorial bearings, over which were the mitre and keys, and the
                  inscriptions beneath told that they were memorials of the deceased Bishops of the
                  diocese. The lesser chancel-lights were four quatre-foils, each bearing the type
                  of an evangelist. In front of the chancel stood a lectern of carved wood. A white
                  marble font was at the entrance of the choir. The rail of the altar was within the
                  arch, its gates opened wide. A small organ, the pipes richly decorated in colors,
                  occupied the niche opposite the entrance, completing the transeptal outline of the
                  building. At the west gable was another door, and over it a window, with the arms
                  of the school, a mitre and crossed keys, emblazoned on it. Maurice owned the
                  subduing influence of the place. As soon as he could compose himself, he knelt
                  down at the font, and remained there some time.</p>
               <p>In the hush of prayer, the wild whirl of doubts and perplexities went from him. He
                  rose from his knees, and went and sat down at the place pointed out, and quietly
                  watched the deepening of the twilight, with which the flaming windows faded to
                  darker and richer, tints. It was to his soul absolute repose. At length he heard
                  the key turn in the lock, and presently an old man came in and began to light the
                  gas. He gave a quick glance at Main-ice, but said no word. Presently he went out,
                  and the quick toll of the chapel-bell was heard. One and another came in; but
                  Maurice bent over his prayer-book, and was rather aware of their coming than saw
                  them with his bodily eyes. He heard the quiet rustle of garments, and caught the
                  passing shadows of black dresses. At last a student took his place at the organ
                  and began a voluntary. The students thronged in, mostly in their black gowns, then
                  several surpliced clergy, and last of all, the Bishop in his robes. The stalls
                  were quite full, though not entirely. The Bishop did not take the mitred stall,
                  but passed on into the chancel within the rail, and presently one of the students
                  came to close the gates, but, at a sign from the Bishop, returned to his place.
                  Maurice expected the usual Cranmer School service, but found instead that the full
                  Even song of the Church was used. The psalter, however, was chanted antiphonally
                  and very heartily. A student read the lessons; the rest of the service was taken
                  by Vincent. Maurice could not help wondering if he were an officer of the school,
                  as he looked at his handsome face, and noted the slender moustache which shaded
                  his lip. In the midst of his tension of feeling, Bryan had that double
                  consciousness not unusual to prolonged excitement. It is said, men on trial for
                  their lives note the veriest trifles with absorbing interest. It was not till the
                  second lesson was drawing to a close, that he remembered that he must come
                  forward. All the blood in his body seemed to well up into his face. One whisper at
                  his heart bade him rise up and flee before was too late. Another, like a far off
                  voice, bade him go on. The lesson ended, and the organist sat quietly turned away
                  from his<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7264-00000137"/> instrument, while wondering
                  looks were exchanged by the students. The Bishop came forward, with a quick and
                  resolute step, toward the font, and, fixing his eyes on Maurice, said, "Let the
                  candidate for baptism present himself." Maurice hardly knew what he must do.
                  Fortunately he did the most natural thing, which was, to come to the front of the
                  choir. He had never seen an adult baptism before, and his ignorance of its details
                  flashed upon him suddenly. Vincent came from the choir-stalls and stood at his
                  right hand. Some one else, he felt, was standing behind him, but who he knew not.
                  He was following, with the utmost intent, each word of the exhortation. A perfect
                  calm had come upon him. He could almost have started at the sound of his own
                  voice, when he replied to the questions, it rang so firm and true. At the second
                  one—"Dost them believe all the articles of the Christian faith as contained in the
                  Apostles' Creed?"—he paused for a moment as he mentally repeated them, and then
                  bowing his head, replied in an accent, the repressed fervor of which thrilled the
                  listeners, "I do." Most impressive were the Bishop's brief prayers, as his hand
                  was held above the head of the candidate. But what voice was it, which, as he
                  knelt, answered to the Bishop's demand, "Name this person?" It was a familiar
                  tone, which aided to swell higher the wave of feeling which swept over him. To his
                  closed eyes, as the water-drops fell on his brow, and the sign of the cross was
                  traced, there came a brief vision of the face and form of Frank, in pure and
                  shining robes. As the service ended, he turned to resume his seat; and the
                  students, rising, began the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Benedic anima.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>He then saw who had been his witnesses. The tall form of Mrs. Gardiner showed that
                  she had been one; but who was the other? That dark, sunbrowned face, hidden by the
                  long, drooping moustache and pointed beard, was known to him, and yet strange. He
                  could not believe himself; but, as for a moment then eyes met, a light of joy and
                  thankfulness came into those of the stranger, which brought back old days and old
                  memories, and Maurice recognized in his other witness—SALTONSTALL WISE.</p>
               <p>The prayers were over, and the Bishop gave out two verses of a psalm, bidding the
                  candidates for confirmation to come forward. Two of the young men in the first row
                  of stalls arose and obeyed. Maurice followed them, and Wise was still at his side.
                  Maurice was past all wonder, with only one feeling—that of a great and rejoicing
                  hope. He had felt that morning utterly cut off from all friends and former ties,
                  and here, he could hardly tell how, they were all around him.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, with the exception of adult baptism, there is no rite of the Church, so
                  impressive to a looker-on as confirmation. Brief as was the interval between the
                  sacrament and his recognition of it, Bryan felt the reality all the more of his
                  witness to his vows. He rejoiced in the laying-on of apostolic hands as the
                  setting of a confirming seal upon his purpose. Each moment was taking him
                  irrevocably from his old self, away from the weary past.</p>
               <p>He rose up from that rail strengthened, renewed, and manful of resolve. And then,
                  sitting in his chair, in quiet tones, which were, nevertheless, almost painfully
                  audible in the hushed stillness of the chapel, the Bishop addressed them. Perhaps
                  it is as well to give his words in their completeness, that non-episcopalian
                  readers may get an idea of what a Bishop says on such occasions.</p>
               <p>"My dear young brethren, it is with no ordinary feeling that I bid you God-speed.
                  It may never again fall to my lot to confirm such a class as this, composed
                  entirely of those who are looking forward to that other laying-on of hands which
                  shall advance them to the ministration-of Christian teaching to others. Yet, if
                  that hope shall lift you; as it surely must, above many of the ordinary
                  temptations that beset the Christian life, it brings you, perhaps, into more
                  dangerous nearness to others. In the low-lying desert, the Tempter-solicited the
                  animal appetite. He took our Lord to the exceeding high mountain, where he would
                  assail the ambition of the intellect. He placed Him upon the giddy pinnacle of the
                  temple, where he appealed to the spiritual pride. Hem ember ever, as you daily
                  pray here, to lay seriously to heart the honor and danger of the trust to which
                  you are to be called.</p>
               <p>"And now, that you may do this, let me give you these few words of caution:
                  Remember that the Church is no place for individual display. It is Christ's
                  kingdom, wherein all are subjects—His vineyard, wherein all are laborers—His army,
                  wherein all move as the Captain of our salvation<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000138"/> wills. What to-night you have renounced was the
                  will and the intent to please yourselves. You are here to learn how more
                  effectually to serve, to arm yourselves, not for the combat which shall win renown
                  and spoil, but for the stern,, hard battle, the wearying strife, wherein, as one
                  falls unheeded, the next must step before—where, so long as the lines advance, the
                  individual deaths are lost in the coming victory. You, at least, whatever the case
                  of the lay-Christian, are to bear in daily remembrance that your reward is not
                  here.</p>
               <p>"And now, my dear young friends, to whom I feel bound by a closer tie than the
                  ordinary interest which a Bishop must ever feel, let me welcome you to your work
                  and your newness of life.</p>
               <p>"From the bondage of the opposing yet confederated errors which assail the life of
                  the Catholic Church, you have come forth. With sincere conviction, I believe and
                  trust, with steadfast purposes, with noble resolves, you stand upon the threshold
                  of active Christian manhood. May the same Holy Spirit whom we have invoked over
                  you guide you, comfort you, defend you, and, at the last, be your approving
                  witness in the great day, when all service shall be accounted unto Him, by whom we
                  are delivered, and for whom we labor!"</p>
               <p>The chapel was empty.: Our two young friends stood face to face in the moonlight,
                  outside the porch. "Bryan, dear old boy!" "Saltonstall, God bless you!" was all
                  they had power to say. In a moment, Vincent came back to look for them. "Come up
                  to the study, please, gentlemen, the Bishop wants to see you."</p>
               <p>As they passed through the hall of the school, Mrs. Gardiner met them. "I hope you
                  did not think it strange my standing as your witness' she said. "I got a note by
                  the evening mail just before I went to chapel, written from Norowam, from Miss De
                  Forrest, my niece. She said she expected you would be at Broadwater daily, and
                  begged me to act as her proxy. She did not like to give up her right as your
                  nearest friend in the Church, as your sister; and yet she could not very well,
                  among strangers here, appear herself. You remember that we met in Rome, Mr.
                  Maurice, and I am delighted to think you will be one of us."</p>
               <p>The Bishop greeted them warmly. "Of course," he said, "Mr. Maurice, my work is
                  ended. You must wait till the Bishop of the diocese returns, before you can
                  complete your arrangements for the school; but that will be only for two days, but
                  do not think of giving up the ministry. Here is your friend, who owns that he once
                  deserted you at Cambridge; you must practice Christian forbearance and
                  forgiveness, and stand by him here. It will be but six months before you can both
                  be ordained deacons. I see you want to be together; to-morrow morning come in and
                  have a long talk with me."</p>
               <p>So Wise and Maurice walked out, and up the moonlit street. "Tell me all about it,
                  Wise, and how, of all men, <emph>you</emph> turned up <emph>here?</emph>"
                  "Maurice, you remember my last letter; you must have got it about two months ago.
                  Well, it was written, but not dated, some eight months before that. I mailed it to
                  you from this country, not knowing your whereabouts, doctrinally I mean, but
                  hoping it would draw your fire and then I could get at you. Between the writing
                  and the sending, I was led to take orders in the I had a fit of fresh and I went
                  Church of Rome—sub-deacon's orders. I had a fit of fresh skepticism, more violent
                  than ever, assail me, and I 'went it blind as they say, in utter desperation. I
                  was never confirmed in the Romish Church, for some reason or other, and my orders
                  were conferred by the abbot of the confraternity—if they are orders, which the
                  Bishop here seems to doubt. Well, this step, which you would have thought final,
                  was the saving of me. I did not herd with the English priests, of whom there are a
                  lot about Rome; their over faith and enormous credulity sickened me. I went in
                  with the Italian priests. They found I was an American; and somehow made me out
                  for a liberal. They let me into a state of things which astounded me, but did me
                  good. Maurice, there is a large body of them, larger than any on-e dreams of here,
                  who are ripe for a reformation. They can think and talk of nothing else when they
                  meet one they can trust. In and through them, I got my first idea of a truly
                     <emph>Catholic</emph> Church, of an inherent vitality which would survive
                  chance and change. I learned another thing, also, and that is that the Church of
                  England and our Church—our Church, Maurice, think of that—are really working for
                  unity of Christendom. I found myself in the society, the<pb n="276-277"
                     xml:id="VAC7264-00000139"/>
                  <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vera catholica,</foreign> which numbers thousands of
                  members. They put into my hands its pamphlets; one of them was written by Bishop
                  ——, the one who has just confirmed us. Then I went in their interests to Paris,
                  and saw the Abb Guette and the Russian arch-priest, Wassileff. They completed the
                  work, and told me what to do. I returned home and learned that Bishop —— was here.
                  I have been with him for six weeks past, though I had not talked with him two days
                  before I found what I wanted. He sent for me this evening, asking me to stand
                  sponsor for a young Unitarian minister, who was to be baptized. You can't think
                  what" I felt when I saw you; however, it was all right. I am herd to live and to
                  die, for the first time in my life, with clear convictions and a definite field of
                  duty. I never had or professed to have such before. It has been all experiment.
                  Now stand by me, won't you?"</p>
               <p>Maurice was silent. "If I have the gift," he said at last, "the power, and the
                  privilege, to serve at my Church's altars, I shall take it. It seems to me awful
                  presumption, after what I have known, and my failures and all; but those who are
                  wiser than I think differently. I leave it in their hands."</p>
               <p>Then followed, of course, the long outpouring of confidences and details of each
                  other's life since they parted.</p>
               <p>We need not go over that again. When Maurice was alone once more, he broke open
                  with hasty hands Maud's letter. "Dear Bryan' it began," when you read this, you
                  will be, by God's grace, my brother. Frank, our dear Frank, was my betrothed
                  lover, my first, my only love; we were both too young to look for an immediate
                  marriage, when we were engaged. When Frank sailed for Europe, after his father's
                  death, there had been, as I told you, a political quarrel between my father and
                  his; but we were just as sure friends as ever, though we did not meet. He suddenly
                  sent me back my letters and presents, and broke the engagement. I did not know
                  why, only, in a brief note, he said it was in no respect my fault. Now I know. The
                  doctor had told him he could not hope for many years of life; he might prolong
                  them by going abroad and living there. He hoped, in the' singleness of his heart,
                  that he might make me give him up entirely, by his seeming harshness. His sister
                  told me all. I had heard it only the week before I met you in the graveyard at
                  Norowam, and I <emph>could</emph> not tell you then. He told her to tell me after
                  he was gone, and to bid me be happy in a new engagement if I could. I have
                  forgiven him the wrong he did my constancy, forgave him in the hour of our only,
                  our last, communion. My uncle and my great-aunt knew nothing of it then. I have, I
                  trust, no unworthy repinings, but my heart lies buried beneath the cypresses of
                  Rome. My life is the Church's. And now that I have told you this, you will not
                  misunderstand me when I say, that you were as a holy bequest, to me from him, that
                  I have prayed for you, watched over you, and have done what I could to bring you
                  into the communion, and, if God will, into the ministry of the Church of Christ.
                  When we meet again, it will be, I trust, to welcome you in that holy calling, to
                  reverence you as my priest, to be taught by you as my pastor. Frank left his whole
                  fortune. I keep it in trust to build and endow a church to the free service of
                  Almighty God. When you are fitted to take charge of that, come to me, and it shall
                  be yours. I shall enter into a sisterhood for the care of the sick, and teaching
                  of the young, the womanly service of our Lord's appointment. The memory of the
                  blessed dead shall be ours for evermore. Yet you, I trust, will marry when the
                  right time comes; I shall never'</p>
               <p>It seemed Bryan's fate to be moved about the world by unexpected coming of
                  letters. That happens, however, to most of us. The Chesuncook Company sent him
                  instructions to go on to Philadelphia. He was still their agent, as far as such
                  work was concerned; so he resigned himself to his fate, and gave up his hope of
                  making his first communion at the chapel the next Sunday. He was directed to pick
                  up his legal adviser in New York, on his way through; which he did, and, in such
                  good company, made his first visit to the Quaker City. They found the business
                  detain them over the hours of departure of any thing earlier than a night-train.
                  It was barely possible something might come up for their attention on Monday
                  morning. So they decided to remain the Sunday. Maurice's companion, as a Boston
                  lawyer, declared his intention of going to hear the distinguished Unitarian
                  preacher. Bryan walked with him as far as the plain little building whose exterior
                  is so disproportionate to the intellectual brilliancy within; and then<pb
                     n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7264-00000140"/> turned westward in search of a church
                  where, he had been assured at the hotel, all the strangers liked to go. He was
                  told to keep on till he reached one of the western squares, and at its corner he
                  would find the place he sought.</p>
               <p>Before he reached the place, he came to a church which arrested his attention, and
                  which he was unwilling to pass by. It stood in its own green yard, with its noble
                  tower abutting on the street, and serving as the porch of entrance. The tower
                  terminated in a broached spire of wonderfully correct proportions, relieved by
                  lucerne windows, not, as ordinarily, looking like excrescences stuck upon the
                  surface, but just breaking the monotony of its outline. A deep chancel, with three
                  windows at its side, was partly decked with clinging ivy wreaths. Each gable was
                  surmounted by a cross. Maurice lingered, for it was yet early, gazing at the
                  architecture, every detail of which showed a feeling most unusual in our land of
                  routine copyists. He passed by, and found that the west end was not inferior; but
                  that, in the same enclosure, stood a little group of irregular buildings in the
                  same style,—evidently the schools of the church. A sound of children's voices
                  singing a hymn was heard through the open windows. He turned back, and looked in
                  at the deep portal. A gentleman was just entering. "Is this an Episcopal Church?"
                  asked Maurice. "Yes, sir. Would you like a seat? Come with me: I shall be most
                  happy to give you one." "I had thought," said Maurice, "of going to —— Church; but
                  this attracts me so much, I do not feel as if I could pass by it. Thank you: I
                  should be most happy." Maurice followed his guide through the deep portal. A
                  curtain was partially drawn aside. The font, richly carved, stood beside a stone
                  pillar on the left of the entrance. It seemed to bid him specially welcome, and to
                  remind him that his was now the believer's privilege. A broad transept division
                  led to a north doorway, through which the children of the Sunday School were
                  coming in. The pavement was of figured tiles, upon which the tread fell without
                  noise. The church was divided into nave and aisles by seven arches on either side,
                  and the lofty clere-story was surmounted by an open roof. The sittings were of
                  oak, low and massive. Maurice noted that the walls were of stone within as well as
                  without, that paint and plaster were nowhere used, and that the columns were
                  monoliths, each with a carved capital. The whole effect was impressive and
                  delightful to a degree he was quite unprepared for. Beyond extended the deep
                  chancel, unbroken by desk or pulpit, with the altar seen afar, upon the rich
                  covering of which stood a pair of chalices, with delicate squares of lawn veiling
                  them; while upon a credence-table, formed by a shelf niched in the wall, were the
                  oblata, covered with their snowy napkin The pulpit was set against the Avail of
                  the chancel arch, while opposite it appeared the lectern: upon it was the open
                  volume of the Holy Book.</p>
               <p>Bryan followed his conductor to a seat not far from the chancel. When he rose from
                  his own private prayers, he was surprised to find his companion still
                  kneeling,—not merely bent forward, but upon his knees; and, as the church filled,
                  he could not help seeing that this was the habit of the place. Almost all who came
                  in, whether young men or old, women or children, showed the same devotion. It was
                  very different from the fashionable carelessness he had been used to witness, and
                  he felt that he had made a happy choice. He looked up at the large east window,
                  the central figure in which was the Saviour, with four apostles and saints beside;
                  and, though to a critical study these would have hardly borne close inspection, in
                  his present mood they impressed him. Presently, the organ, which was placed at the
                  north side of the chancel, behind a fretted screen of carved oak, began a
                  voluntary, and two surpliced and stoled clergymen issued from the vestry, and
                  knelt at the stalls on either side. The one farthest from him, next the lectern,
                  read the opening sentences in a clear, rich voice, and then, turning to the
                  people, began the exhortation. Maurice was struck with the purity his face
                  expressed, the refined and tender intellectual cast of his delicate features. His
                  accent was the slightly peculiar one of Philadelphia,—a pleasant change from the
                  nasality of the New England head-voice. The Confession followed,—all around him
                  rising up the subdued murmur of voices from the entire congregation: at the close
                  of which, there came, in unison with a single organ-note, a chanted "Amen." Then
                  followed the Absolution, with the same response. The unseen choir in front replied
                  in the same manner to the versicles and <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Gloria;</foreign>
                  and, after the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Venite,</foreign> the Psalter of the day<pb
                     n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7264-00000141"/> was chanted, antiphonally, to a series
                  of beautiful Anglican chants. It was to Maurice very moving to stand there with
                  his thought following the rapt utterances of the Psalms, and looking into the
                  vista, on either side of which, like guardian angels, were the white-robed clergy.
                  Beneath the great east window, he saw the floriated cross upon the altar's
                  frontal, and, above, the golden gleam of the chalices. He could, with a new
                  emotion, lift up his voice in the simple but stirring Gregorian to which the
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Te Deum</foreign> was sung, and his heart was very
                  "joyful in the Lord" in the thrilling burst of the <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >Jubilate.</foreign> Then followed the Nicene Creed. It was to him a personal
                  confession of his faith in the "one Lord JESUS CHRIST," as, like a wind-swept
                  harvest-field, all heads bowed at the beloved name. Tears rose to his eyes as he
                  repeated, "I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins." He could join now
                  in the prayers of the Litany, as never before, with a love both purified and
                  humbled. At the close of the Litany, the other clergyman announced the Introit for
                  the day. Maurice caught sight of his face, and, with a start of joy, recognized
                  Professor Wentworth. It was very comforting to him that it would not be a stranger
                  who should give him his first communion. The responses to the Commandments were
                  chanted to a peculiarly beautiful movement; and this (to Maurice) new feature in
                  the worship was at first strange, and then very pleasing. At the close of the
                  ante-Communion service, the Rector gave out the hymn, but did not go into the
                  vestry: he merely knelt at the rail during the last verse, and then went straight
                  into the pulpit. Without announcement of text or subject, he began a brief
                  address. It was a concise statement of the threefold meaning of the office he was
                  about to celebrate: "A sacrifice, not in letter, but in spirit; for 'ye do show
                  forth the Lord's death till he come.' It was offered in commemoration by the
                  Christian priest, upon the Christian altar; yet, as all were kings and priests
                  unto the Lord, while the ministerial work was that of official commemoration, the
                  worshipping people were to offer and present their souls and bodies, a reasonable,
                  holy, and living sacrifice. It was a Eucharist also,—the great thank-offering for
                  accomplished redemption. It was the sign of rejoicing, which, though dimmed by the
                  sense of sin, was yet animated by the Christian hope, was the symbol of the
                  reposing posing faith of Paradise, and the full fruition of heaven. It was also,
                  and last, the Communion by faith with the invisible presence of Christ, was the
                  reception of the sanctifying life of the Holy Ghost, and the type of access to the
                  forgiving Father, wrought through the union of the Divine Son, both with that
                  Father above, and with the repentant and returning child below. As the seal and
                  pledge of these mysteries, it was to each and all, with each and all, the common
                  partaking." And then his voice swelled and deepened in an earnest appeal to those
                  present not to turn away. After all earthly ties were sundered, he bade them
                  remember this remained: for the faithful dead who slept in the Lord Jesus, for the
                  sorrowing believers who lingered here, there was this great and exceeding comfort.
                  By their sense of sins forgiven, by their thankfulness for blessings manifold, by
                  their renewed aspirations after holiness, he besought them not to turn away. The
                  deep hush which followed the eloquent tones of that voice, which all who listen to
                  love, was broken only by the rising of the congregation at the Ascription, and the
                  chanting of the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Gloria Patri</foreign> which followed. The
                  Rector re-entered the chancel, and took from the credence the golden alms-basins.
                  The gentleman at his side gave a quick glance around, and then rose and went
                  forward. Maurice was struck with the reverent manner of the wardens and vestrymen,
                  so unlike the careless lounge or pompous strut which BO frequently disfigures the
                  lay assistance in this part of the service. Only one thing jarred at all upon
                  Maurice's mood; the gold-piece he laid upon the plate lay amid a number of the
                  smallest silver coin known to our currency. He blushed as if he had made a
                  blunder: but the answering color came into the face of the tall and nobler-looking
                  vestryman who bore the plate; and Maurice, if he had known, might have found that
                  his offering had called forth a twenty-dollar note from the pocket of the other.
                  No one stirred from the slip in which Maurice was, as the non-communicants passed
                  quietly out. There was no noisy blare of the organ, as too often at such times,
                  but a quiet gliding away, as dissolving snows melt into quiet droplets. Maurice
                  did not rise from his knees till the Rector's voice began the address, and then
                  the congregation in front of him seemed in no degree less dense. It was a strange,
                  feeling to Maurice when he found<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7264-00000142"/>
                  himself no longer a spectator, but a participant in the service. He strove with
                  all his might to abstract himself in the rite. He succeeded in part; but it was
                  not till the ' silence which came when the kneeling celebrant partook of the
                  consecrated gifts that he was able to lift his thoughts entirely to what was
                  before him. The haunting, distressful feeling of unfitness which so often besets
                  the first communion, before the spirit is disciplined and trained, was upon him.
                  One sentence that he had heard that morning came to his aid—"worthy because of
                  unworthiness, fit because <emph>conscious</emph> of unfitness;" yet, though calmed
                  by prayer, his heart beat very quickly as he followed his companion at last up to
                  the chancel. A lady dressed in quiet half-mourning stood immediately before him,
                  so that they knelt side by side at the first place left vacant. As the priest
                  stood before them, Maurice saw him break a portion of the bread in twain as he
                  administered it. The communion was very full, and the elements were obliged to be
                  carefully given. It shared between him and his neighbor the same fragment; and
                  presently, when the bearer of the chalices came to them, each drank at the same
                  moment. Maurice thought nothing of it then, of course; but, presently, it was to
                  come to him in a way he little expected. In that excited state of the perceptions
                  which is apt to co-exist with strong spiritual emotion, we are often compelled to
                  note and remember similar circumstances.</p>
               <p>Deep was the feeling, almost overpowering the joy, with which Maurice returned to
                  his place. He knelt, praying long and fervently, till the congregation rose to
                  join in the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Gloria in Excelsis.</foreign> Then his eye
                  fell upon the young lady who had knelt beside him. Several, who had occupied
                  intermediate slips, had left the church after receiving (for the church had been
                  very full, and more than three hundred had been at the rail before Maurice went
                  up.) She was standing but a few slips in advance, and something familiar, which he
                  could not explain, drew his attention to her. The choir had mostly left the church
                  after the Trisagion, leaving only two or three voices to lead the congregation.
                  The <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Gloria</foreign> was sung to an invariable chant,
                  well-known to all. Somewhere, there rang in his ears a familiar voice, and,
                  strangely, fantastically, it seemed to him, he was thinking of the city of Rome.
                  He thrust back the thought resentfully fully, as an alien intrusive feeling. When
                  the benediction had been spoken, and Maurice was ready to depart, he turned to
                  thank the stranger who had given him a seat. This would, no doubt, have led to
                  further conversation; but another of the vestry came up to say something, and
                  Maurice, thinking he would wait outside, went toward the west door. The sexton had
                  lifted its curtain, as the congregation retired, and the full radiance of noon
                  poured through the arch. A female figure was standing in the clear, bright space
                  of the door-way. Her dark dress helped to give the impression of mere outline—a
                  distinct, dark shadow, and nothing more—and so the peculiarities of attitude were
                  the more marked. Maurice saw it all in a moment. It "was precisely thus that he
                  had seen the young Quakeress stand upon the night when she had lost her way at
                  Rome. There was just the patient, waiting, enduring look. The blood rushed to his
                  heart, and a sick and faint feeling came over him. It was cruel for such a mocking
                  likeness to come at such a time. He stepped hastily forward, and then as
                  instinctively checked himself. Just then a little girl came from the church-yard.
                  "O-Miss Ellen!" she said, "I've been waiting and waiting ever so long to tell you
                  that Jane is better, and mother says she will have her baptized tomorrow, at
                  evening service." "Thank you, Lucy, dear. Tell your mother I will come and see
                  here was the reply. Maurice could doubt no longer, and yet the sea, the pitiless
                  sea, gives not up its dead. He shook his head sadly. It was a cruel trial. She
                  left the church. Maurice was about to follow, when he saw that she crossed the
                  yard, and went into the school-building. He turned again to the porch, meaning to
                  wait on the street outside. Two ladies stood in the entrance talking. He overheard
                  one say, "Did you see Ellen Win row, to-day? Her face was almost heavenly, I have
                  not seen her look so happy since the night when she was confirmed." Maurice could
                  hesitate no longer: he turned back at once, determined to seek her out. She had re
                  entered the church, with her Sunday-school class-books in her hand, and was
                  passing through it, so that they met just at the font. The broad light of noonday
                  revealed them each to the other. She stood perfectly still, her eyes growing
                  larger and larger, and then sank down at the base of the carved stone of the font.
                  Maurice sprang to her to<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7264-00000143"/> raise her up,
                  saying (for his calmness came back to him) "Ellen!—Miss Winrow!—do not be alarmed:
                  it is I—Bryan Maurice' The ladies in the porch had seen it all, and hastened back.
                  Ellen unclosed her eyes a moment, murmuring only, "Thankful!—so thankful! I knew—I
                  knew it would come' and then relapsed into her fainting spell. Maurice gently laid
                  her head in the lap of one of the ladies, the one who had spoken, who had at once
                  sat down on the base of the font beside her; and then, after one glance into the
                  basin to see if by chance any water could be left there, which of course there was
                  not, darted off to the vestry. He startled the good Rector and assistant very
                  decidedly by his abrupt entrance, as he seized the water-pitcher, only pausing to
                  say, "A lady fainted' which caused them to hurry on their coats, in place of their
                  just-discarded cassocks, and to follow him down the aisle. 'The gray-haired sexton
                  had partially dropped the curtain, the elder of the two ladies had taken off
                  Ellen's bonnet, and the younger was fanning her energetically. Both looked sharply
                  at Maurice, as with the feminine instinct of sisterly sympathy, they regarded him,
                  in some wicked way the cause of so much emotion. But all suspicions were put to
                  flight as the young girl opened her eyes once more; and, as she saw Maurice, the
                  blood surged back to her cheeks. She tried to rise. Maurice knelt down beside her,
                  and put his hand in hers. She held it with a long-clinging clasp. "You have come
                  back to me from the dead' she said, "at last, I knew at the altar to-day that a
                  great blessing was coming to me; but I did not know what it was." "Hush, hush!
                  Ellen: you must not try to talk. Dr. Wentworth, we must have a carriage for her,
                  and get her home' said the lady who was holding her. "Oh, no; I am better: let me
                  get up." "Keep still, deary, keep still; and Dr. Wentworth or Mr. Arden, if one of
                  you will send a carriage, we will wait here with her." So, as she was really
                  bettor, though very weak, the others went away, leaving Maurice with the ladies.
                  Most peremptorily, Mrs. —— the eider, forbade anything like explanations, saying,
                  "No, no: you shall see each other to-morrow, and talk as much as you like; but now
                  it would only distress her. It is enough for you, deary, if you know that it is
                  all right: keep entirely qui." Which counsel, considering that she (an experienced
                  enced mother and happy wife, with a most tender sympathy, and eke abundant
                  curiosity) was burning to know more, was very praiseworthy. The sexton returned
                  with the carriage, and Ellen was able to walk to it, and even to protest against
                  any one being allowed to go home with her. She was obliged to submit, and the
                  younger lady, a fellow teacher in the Sunday School, got in with her. Maurice
                  would gladly have followed, but the matron interposed. "No," she said, "I shall
                  play duenna to-day to you young folks; and meanwhile, as my home is but a little
                  way from here, I shall insist upon taking you with me, sir. You are not fit to
                  walk to any of the hotels, and there are no cars on Sunday." She saw that Maurice
                  was fearfully overdone by excitement, was pale and trembling now, and she, with
                  that rare instinct of good sense that she possesses, had comprehended that it was
                  a case wherein ordinary etiquette should be postponed. Maurice was too much
                  agitated to do anything but passively yield. She would not let him speak a word,
                  even to apologize, but took him straight to her house, and got him comfortably
                  seated in her cool parlor, and made him swallow a glass of wine before she let him
                  utter a syllable. Then, placing herself quietly on the sofa, and untying her
                  bonnet, she began: "I suppose I guess a good deal, and I think I ought to know
                  more, for Ellen Winrow is almost like one of my own girls ever since she lost her
                  father and mother. I have taken it for granted that she would approve what I am
                  doing. It was not mere surprise that made her faint. Were you the gentleman she
                  met in Rome, and who was with her on the 'Mystic on her last voyage?" Maurice
                  bowed: he could not trust himself to speak. "You see, sir, I know a part: Ellen
                  told me some things when she was preparing for confirmation; not much, but
                  something which came out in explanation, and I feel as if I ought to know more."
                  "There was no formal engagement between us," Maurice said, "but I had reason to
                  hope, that, if we reached home in safety, there would be: and now, if Ellen—if
                  Miss Winrow—is free, and not changed in heart—" "That you must find out for
                  yourself: I am not to give, but to get confidence, sir. I see that you are a
                  communicant of the church; but I think I may, without impertinence, waive ceremony
                  so far as to ask you what else you are?" "I have been a Unitarian minister:<pb
                     n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7264-00000144"/> I am now, or next week to be, a
                  candidate for orders in the Cranmer School at Broadwater. My father was the late
                  Judge Maurice of Massachusetts "Whom I knew in Washington, when he was in Congress
                  from your State. I thought I saw a look of some one I knew very well. That is
                  quite enough for me. So I ask no more questions, except why on earth you never met
                  Ellen since?"</p>
               <p>The reader shall not be required to be present at the unfolding of that mystery,
                  which came out by means of a longer conversation than we need to give. Miss Winrow
                  was saved by a fishing-boat, and taken into St. John's, Newfoundland, and from
                  there got passage to England, to join her brother, who had remained in London to
                  enter a business house. Her name did not appear at the time Upon the lists of the
                  saved; and Maurice, arriving before the rest of the rescued, was, for a like
                  reason, not included. Each supposed the other lost. The quiet life which Maurice
                  had led, and his disinclination to speak of his shipwreck, had prevented his
                  hearing of Ellen's return. Any one who knows the nine-days'-wonder rapidity with
                  which events pass out of the American mind will hot find this strange. The good
                  lady, being satisfied that she was doing right, would not hear of Maurice's
                  returning to his hotel. "You are in six months to be a clergyman—and that is next
                  to being one-and no clergyman goes out of this house without sharing its
                  hospitality." So she kept him to dinner; and then insisted that he should go to
                  afternoon service, and return to tea, to meet Dr. Wentworth, whom she found that
                  he knew. She added, playfully, that he should not stir out of her sight till it
                  was too late for him to go and try to see Miss Winrow. So, as he did not, and
                  could not, discover where, in the tolerably good-sized city, Miss Winrow was to be
                  found, he rested content, perforce, in a promise that on the morrow the
                  information should be given. He did not know that Mrs. —— had snatched a moment's
                  opportunity to write a loving little note to Ellen, telling her that she could not
                  see Mr. Maurice till the next day, and that she must not do anything but rest.
                  Very quietly the gentle-spirited girl resigned herself to it, and lay on her sofa
                  at her home, now at her aunt's house, where she had lived since her return. She
                  knew all: she had the feeling of utter trust. God had given back to her the one of
                  whom she had not ceased to think in the reserve of her virgin heart.</p>
               <p>The next morning there came, however, a natural revulsion of doubt. Her heart was
                  beating very fast when the door-bell rang, and she was sent for to the parlor.
                  Mrs. ——, her friend, was there alone. "I have just tell minutes to spare, Ellen,
                  with you: not one more. I peremptorily ordered Mr. Maurice to walk four squares up
                  Chestnut before he returned into 1-th. When he comes back, he is to pass through
                  here, and, where he sees me at the window, he may ring the bell. I would not tell
                  him the number, or let him see me come in. I would not have you taken by surprise;
                  and, if you do not want to see him, you shall say so. When he comes, I shall go up
                  to your aunt's room, and sit with her as long as I think proper for him to stay,
                  and then come down and order him off. I will tell aunty all I know about him,
                  which is all good. You were made for a minister's wife, Nelly; and now you have
                  your chance, darling." Ellen blushed crimson, as a tumult of happy thoughts rushed
                  upon her. She was puzzling herself much, however, over this last remark, which she
                  inwardly resolved should not be long of explanation; but, in all the timidity of
                  maidenly reserve, she, busied herself with a vase of flowers upon the table,
                  arranging them with hands that trembled in spite of her efforts to be composed.
                  The good lady walked to the window and pulled up the blind, regardless of the fact
                  that it was high noon, and utterly unconventional for her to be sitting there in
                  bonnet and shawl. She kept up a steady stream of talk, waiting for no answers;
                  till, suddenly, with a brief nod towards the street, she sprang up, saying, "Now
                  for aunty!" took Ellen to her heart, and kissed her; and then swept out of the
                  room, past the servant who was just answering the bell of the hall-door.</p>
               <p>One moment, and Maurice was beside his long-lost, newfound love. He knew not what
                  he said, or she what she answered, if she did answer; but her head lay upon his
                  bosom, his strong arm was holding her in that clasp which seals, before witnessing
                  angels, the pledge for a life-long faith.</p>
               <p>Nobody will care for the plain prose of the journey home to Broadwater, which
                  Maurice had to take the next day. Ellen would not hear of his lingering for her
                  sake. She was heroic for him. It was necessary that he should begin at once his
                  course of study, in order to be ready for the Lenten-Embertide ordination. He
                  could get away at Christmas<pb n="288" xml:id="VAC7264-00000145"/> mas, but not
                  before; and, after Easter, if he said so, her home should be wherever was his.
                  Meanwhile, letters were to be his comfort and her daily joy. So they parted, after
                  brief meeting. But her Sunday-school children, and the poor, among whom she had
                  been a very sister of charity, never worshipped her so much, never found her so
                  lovely as during that winter of untiring service; and stormy indeed was the winter
                  day that missed her steps from the deep-arched portal of her church, and her
                  presence at its daily prayers. People asked inquisitively why Ellen Winrow had
                  left off her mourning, but got no satisfactory answer from the Very few friends
                  who were in the secret.</p>
               <p>There stands a lovely church in one of our flourishing towns, which, with its
                  schools and rectory, almost realizes the Dreamland fancies of the good Bishop in
                  whose diocese it is. There, laboring and preaching, catechizing, praying, and
                  ministering the sacraments of the New Birth and the Heavenly Life, is Bryan
                  Maurice. Not alone; for Ellen is with him. Not friendless; for, beside the warm
                  hearts who are gathering to his side, there conies to that parsonage, at the
                  holy-tide of Easter, one who is ever a loved guest; for sister Maud then takes a
                  brief resting-spell from her constant work of mercy. She comes to her one great
                  joy—the keeping of the Queen of Festivals in the church whose every stone is the
                  memorial to her buried love. No other hand than hers is suffered to order the
                  flowers which fill, and droop over, the white marble font, upon whose vase is
                  carven, in tiny letters which only the loving few who know its history can read
                  and understand, "In memory of F. G." There is a beautiful east window, too, upon
                  whose glowing panes is the figure of the Lord stilling the tempest; and, upon the
                  slender scroll which threads the fair colors at its foot, you may read, in ancient
                  type, the text, "And there was no more sea." If your eyes are good, you may also
                  trace the fainter inscription: "A thank-offering for great deliverance." And
                  Saltonstall Wise comes there, in the summer heats, from his busy city parish, and
                  writes cheery and quaint letters, filled with his fiery hopes of a united
                  Christendom—of his frank indignation of all time-serving and pettinesses which
                  delay the Church's needful work. Men say, too, that upon him will yet be laid the
                  solemn cares, the dread responsibilities of a Missionary Bishopric.</p>
