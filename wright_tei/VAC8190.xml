OO.'BVUSSELL t CO., PBINTBrm .-    PREFACE ONE year since, with fear and trembling, I gave to the world my testimony against the Mormon delu- sion.* It was not a history of that people, or the rise and progress of their singular creed. It made no pretensions even to trace them as a body through their various settlements in the Western country pre- vious to their emigration to the Valley, of the Great Salt Lake. It was designed simply as a record of personal experience--a transcript of events written from memory; a faithful narrative of such hopes and fears, joys and sorrows, as any woman placed in such circumstances must necessarily feel. The success of that venture emboldens me to send another barque in the same track, though this time it is the experiencedand adventures of another-of a man. Of course he takes a somewhat different view, * is Female Life Among the Momions;'   &#xD;<pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC8190-00000004"/> Vi         PFAOZB.  -  o    . .. -.   .  ... but his account corroborates my testimony. EHe pre- sents a philosophical view of the Mormonswith their moral and social' condition as a community; but that neither softens nor modifies the nature of thie facts which came beneath his observation. It was not from ambition or the love of gold, but a sense of duty to my country and, the 'orld, that the other book was written. The impostors .are still-abroad in the land; every month brings the arrival of- their dupes from foreign shores. Again I lift the -voice of warning. Beware of their ats.--Enter hot. the circleoof their fascinations; their-charms are like those of the ser- pent, and lead to the death of all that is holy and beautiful in this life, and all 'that can support the anxious soul 'in its moments of dissolution, and give it a happy and abundant entrance into the presence 'of just men made perfect. I have been careful to preserve "the thoughts and 'sexitiments of the writer. -In no case have I changed or omitted a sentence, because it did 'not agree with my feelings and opinions. I wished to be true to him as I'had!been -to myself. Thewrniter was the nephew of my husband.

I hand them over tog you, kind public, relying on your candor and gene- rosity for a charitable appreciation of the work and the motives which prompted it. - MARTA WARD. * , * *  *  &#xD;<pb n="viii-ix" xml:id="VAC8190-00000005"/>  THE EDITOR'S DESIGN.  THE public mind has begun to appreciate, with some degree of correctness,' the evil influence of the Mormon faith, and the true nature of its institutions. It has at least commenced to perceive the extent of folly and wickedness that must naturally grow up under such a system, adverse alike to democratic institutions and the truths of Christianity. Priestcraft, in its worst phase, is the soul and life of Mormonism. The United States, as well as foreign countries, teem a with these men and their confederates, whose morality is even more lax, whose delusion finds readier dupes, and whose designs are more sinister and dangerous than those of, Rome. Polygamy and the con- version. of women are accounted -among the chief instrumentalities to promote their designs. To support the one and effect the other the most strenuous exertions are made. Nor is it always the case that efforts to secure fresh victims are confined to the use of persuasion and advice, but physical assistance can be rendered when necessary to abduct and carry off, in some emigrant train or caravan, such youth of either sex as circumstances throw in their way. If either of these volumes * should be the means of warning one individual to escape their nefarious designs, I shall have been amply repaid for all my pains and labor. * The Author here refers to the popular work entitled "Female Life among the Mormons."      . , . - 1*  &#xD;<pb n="x-xi (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC8190-00000006"/>  C ON T E N T S.

The Great Salt Lake City, called Zion by the Mor- mons, is pleasantly situated. They are fond of comparing it to the ancient capital of Judea, though to find any resemblance between the two, must require a great stretch of imagination. For sublime and picturesque scenery, the Mormon city has o, rival in the world. Behind it, like an amphitheatre, rise the lofty summits of the Wahsatih mountains, whence never-failing streams of fresh water descend, and are conducted in small channels on either side ot the streets. The city is well laid out ; the streets, which ares one hundred and twenty feet wide, intersect each other at right angles, and are ornamented by rows of cottonwood trees. The houses are all adobes with the exception of the Governor's palace. They are substantial and elegant, and though generally small, a few are very large and commodi- ous; each house Stands back a short distance from the street, and is surrounded by a, small garden; each block has a bishop or spiritual overseer, whose duty it is to know   INCIDENTS AND FPRST IMPRESSIONS.     17 everything passing within his jurisdiction. He must examine every week into the moral and material condition of each family, and report to the Governor. With this prelimi- nary notice of Utah, and its famous city, I shall proceed to recount whatever was most interesting, amusing, and instructive to me during my visit to that place, in the sum- mer of 1855. INCIDENTS AND FIRST IMPRESSIONS. I was one of a small company who took the overland route to California, n ore for the amusement of the thing than any other purpose. We hunted buffalo on the plains, visited trappers in the mountains, and feasted with half- naked savages, till novelty gave place to weariness, and our approach to the habitations of civilized man, was attended with feelings of decided pleasure. When the saints from the United States, or other parts of the world, arrive within sight of the city, they prostrate themselves to the earth like the Mohammedans when they discover the sacred edifices of Mecca; in our case, however, the discovery of its gleam- ing habitations was only hailed by a shout of joy, and accelerated speed along the well-worn road. This road, though generally good, was quite as remarkable as other things belonging to the same territory. It went bending, hither and thither, first to to the right, then- to thexleft, winding around the mountain spurs, and the bases of hills, till finally reaching the plain on which the city stands, we  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8190-00000010"/> 18       THE IiU8S BAND IN UTAH. entered it just as the -sun was declining in the western horizon, and the shadows of night began to gather on the mountain tops. Of course our first desire was to obtain shelter and food, not only for that night, but several weeks. Zion was crowded with visitors, travellers, and emigrants, under similar necessities. There are some persons who for a consideration will supply what we want-I say for a con. sideration-the Mormon brethren in this respect resembling the Jews of old, who while. affecting to despise the Gen- tiles, were at the same time strongly enamored of Gentile gold. We applied for lodgings at the United States Hotel, kept by the Hon. Mr. Kinney, U. S. judge for the terri- tory of Utah, but to our great disappointment his house was full. He likewise expressed regret, but gave us directions to a smaller and much inferior establishment, kept by a- Aormon-Brother Underwood. "BROTHER UNDERWOOD!" I said to myself, walking in the direction of his house, "that name sounds familiar," nd I patiently strove to recall where or under what circumstances I became acquainted with its owner. Thus meditating, I reached the domicile. It was now nearly dark ; there was no candle or lamp burn- ing, and I could obtain only a very unsatisfactory glimpse of my host.  Yet his manner was kind and cordial, and he spoke in a frank cheerful voice. I told him my necessi- -ties. He said, very well, he would see, and disappeared.   BROrtUlEs UNDERWOOD.        19 The formality usual in Eastern hotels was entirely di- pensed with here. There was no registry of names, and there seemed to be no clerks or assistants, with the exception of a small boy, who acted in the double capacity of errand runner and bar-tender. At present he sat dozing behind a small counter, apparently unconscious of the presence of a stranger ; meanwhile We heard some one (whom we sup- posed to be our'host) running up and down stairs, opening and shutting doors, and calling through the rooms, "Nelly, Nellyl"After an absence sufficiently prolonged to have cooked and prepared a good supper, he returned with the dismal intelligence that there was no one in the house who could get us anything to eat, but that he would show us to our apartments if we desired to remain. 'My companions  angrily expostulated with the man. He excused the matter by throwing the blame on his wives ; they generally took turns, he said, in. going out, and the one whose duty it was to stay at home, had neglected or forgotten it. He supposed she was at a neighbor's, though where, it would be impossible to tell. All but myself decided to depart. I was secure of a shelter, that was half I sought, and I hoped that the remainder might be forthcoming; so taking up my tra- velling-bag, I bade my companions call on me the ensuing day, and with a hearty " good night," prepared to follow my obsequious host.  The room to which he consigned me was a sort of little cell. He had brought up in his hand a -short piece of tallow candle, contained in an iron can-    &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8190-00000011"/> 20       THE HUSBAND m  UTAH. dlestick, which to judge from its appearance, might have been coeval with Noah's ark. This he placed on a rude semblance of a table, and unceremoniously withdrew. I scarcely had- courage to inspect the apartment. I hoped that the roof was tight, and the bed clean. I hoped too, that by-and-by I might be summoned to supper, though my better judgment rebelled against such anticipations. On rummaging my pockets, however, I found the remains of a broken cracker, and a small portion of dried fruit, which " had hitherto escaped my notice. This I ate, and commend- ing myself to Divine Providence, retired to bed, though determining to lie awake, at least, until the candle burnt out. The more I saw of Brother Underwood the morel firmly I became convinced that I had been previously acquainted with him. At length, with a sudden flash of thought, I remembered the time and circumstances. It was in the State of New York. My introduction to him was merely casual, though with the woman he subsequently married I was intimately acquainted.- How exceedingly strange I Would she know me? Would she receive me as a friend? I questioned. Only those who have been far from home and friends can realize with what delight I anticipated meeting with an old acquaintance, in whose society some of the happiest days in my life had been spent. Then it occurred to -me that I might be mistaken, and having by this time relinquished all hopes of supper, I saw the candle swale, flare, and flicker without reluctance. A moment   MY ACCo1MOUDATI'ONS.       21 more it blazed, flashed up suddenly, then the wick fell over to one side, became saturated in the melted tallow, and'all was darkness.  I cannot say that my bed reminded me of any I had ever slept in before ; for to tell the truth, it did not. Though . not much inclined to luxuriousness, I found it hard, cold, and uncomfortable. It was yet early in the season, and cool nights are characteristic of the climate of Utah, even in the midst of summer. I wished: for a warm quilt or cover- lid, but as none could be had, determined to be satisfied without it. After all, there is no philosophy like that which prompts a man to conform to circumstances, and make the bdst -of everything. With these feelings I composed myself to rest, and soon fell asleep. I awoke in the morning with a gnawing sensation of hunger, and actually shivering with cold. Silence prevailed throughout the house, and no one seemed to be stirring, though it was broad day. I had full leisure and opportunity to examine my room and its con- comitants. I found it a hard thing, indeed, to be satisfied therewith, and unavoidably found myself wishing that its general appearance were otherwise. Notwithstanding all my philosophy, I felt that my satisfaction would be greater were more neatness a;d taste displayed in its arrangements. I had been accustomed to lave my hands and face in the fresh mountain springs, and could not be content with the quart bowl of water prepared for my use. Then the napkfn had evidently grown old in some other employment before being applied to its present purpose. I think that if the  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8190-00000012"/> 22       THE HUSBAND IN tTAH. floor had been well scrubbed and sanded, this wall piece of old, dusty, faded rag .carpet might be happily dispensed with. The uncurtained window looks unpleasant, the glass being so dingy that before looking through it to. obtain a viewof the mountains, I am obliged to wash it with the napkin, in which laudable endeavor to exercise the vocation of chamber-maid, I pushed out one of the panes. It fell to the ground and broke -with a crash, probably awaking the family, as I heard them moving about soon after. In attempting to seat myself on one of the chairs, it let me sprawling to the floor, and I ascertained that, one leg being broken, it could only be retained 'in an upright position while standing with its back to the wall. My table had evidently been a stranger to hydropathy for a very long time. Instead of a lock, my door was fastened with a wooden button. The fireplace was filled with ashes and cinders, while the jambs were literally festooned with pendent webs. I look around for a bell. The apartment is not furnished with Iny such convenience. I think of ordering a fire. I wonder when breakfast will be. ready. I ponder the best way of making myself known to the landlady. I muse on a thousand other things, till tired out of all patience with wait; ing to be summoned below, I hastil scended and made my way to the bar-room without foi6abty. T I found Brother Underwood in the bar. He was quietly munching a hard brown lump, designated a rusk. He looked up, and his broad features relaxed into a smile. "-Got in a hurry for breakfast, eh Y" he inquired.    BECOOQ LtNSG- AN ACQUAIMT1A1OE.   28 I replied in the affirmative, reminding him that I had no supper the night before. "Ah yes," he answered, "I recollect, Nelly was out." I paid no attention to this remark, but again referred to the morning meal. "Certainly, certainly," he said, "it will soon be ready." There was certainly a great rush-of business going on in a neighboring apartment, and as my host seemed communi- cative, lively, and amiable, I sat -down to wait patiently and converse with him. "How   long have you been in Utah'?"I ventured to inquire. "About five years," he replied, musingly. "Ad you removed from   Cortland County, in the State of New York." "Why do you ask?" "Because your voice, and   face, and name, strongly remind me of one with whom I was formerly acquainted.'; "Your name?" he inquired, I mentioned it. He   looked earnestly in my face for a minute or two. "Yes," he observed, " I have a faint recollection of your features, and I have heard my wife speak of you." "Her name was Maria R   " He assented, and held out his hand. I  met his grasp with a cordial pressure. "I shall'be most happy to see her," I observed.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8190-00000013"/> 24       THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. "You will probably meet at breakfast," he said. "I wonder whether or not she will know you?" Probably an hour elapsed before we were summoned to breakfast, and then a faded woman came to the door with the announcement. I directed an inquiring glance towards my host. "My second wife," be remarked. "Oh, I beg pardon." A "No apologies are necessary," he replied, leading the way to the breakfast room. Half a dozen women, all the wives of my host, were standing around. I knew Maria at a glance, though she gave me no look or token of recogni- tion. Her husband smiled, and inquired if she had forgotten an old friend; she gazed curiously in my face, then her countenance lighted up, and she cordially offered her hand. Our meeting, however, under such circumstances was one- of painful embarrassment. I could not help speculating on the appearance of Maria compared to what it had formerly ' been. I had known her as one of the most tidy and indus- trious of girls, and now her dress and manner were indica- tive of the utmost carelessness and negligence, to say noth- ing of the want of neatness conspicuous in every part of the house. Though my hunger gave it a zest, the breakfast was anything but good. There was not a dish on the table even tolerably well cooked. The coffee was bitter and "muddy," the meat burned, the bread half dough, and the' butter-but I forbear to speak of that-it looked inde- scribably, and I did not taste it.   AN INVITATION.        25 ' As you are an old acquaintance," said Underwood, "I shall expect you to make my house your home during your stay in this place. You can scarcely expect to be better accommodated. Quiet is a, great thing, sir, a very great thing. I have no boarders except my family, and littip custom.  Of course, I don't want much-just a little to bring in a trifle of change, is all that I desire. It is expen- sive living here, very-so many mouths to fill," and he glanced at his wives. "]ow long did you design staying?" inquired Maria. "That depends on circumstances." "You will stay with us, I will see that you have com- fortable accommodations," said Maria. "All the other houses of entertainment are full," con- tinued Underwood.  "They always are.  The brethren moved out here to be separated from the rest of the world, and build up a righteous and holy kingdom, but it seems that the world cannot do without them." - Maria turned her eyes towards him imploringly, "I should suppose that my companions would soon be here," I  observed, wishing to change the conversation; nor was I   mistaken. On rising from from the tabe, I heard' voices in the bar-room. "They have come," I  ejaculated, and: taking French leave of the ladies, went out to meet them. "And what do  you think of Mormondom?" inquired Harry Buck, the moment we were out of the house. "I shall reply by retorting the same question," I answer- d. "What -do you think of it?"  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8190-00000014"/> 26       THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. "What will induce me to get away as soon as possible," he said. "We, are going on to-morrow." "To-morrow!"I exclaimed with surprise. "You needn't look so scared up," he, said, laughing. "Is it strange that a man should wish to leave a place where he can get nb food but roasted potatoes, and no shelter but an old emigrant wagon cover." "Has this been your fare?" "Certainly it 'has. - We went around to the different houses of entertainment, but all were full. We could pre- sent no claim to the hospitality of the Saints, and had not an old Indian fortunately come to our assistance, we should have been compelled to pass the night in the streets, or to have sought. you out with a certainty of not getting any supper." And the old fellow took pity, on your forlorn con-  dition?"  "He did. He cheerfully shared his bed and food with us. It was poor and scant to be sure, and only better than none."?' "Is he a Mormon?" "A Mormon! No; he hates and despises the whole sect  says they are thieves, liars, and devils; in short, the greatest rascals in existence." "That may be all true," I replied, " yet I prefer to have evidence of the fact. I have succeeded in finding an old friend, and shall remain some time, probably all summer."   i They tried in vain to dissuade me, but my resolution once    BIRO'mTB; rvNDIRWOOD'8 ORTEODOXY.     27 taken was not easily moved. Various reasons which it is not necessary to repeat, influenced my decision, and the matter was settled.. I. found a manifest improvement in the appearance of things at Brother Underwood's when I returned tt night. Thefloors had been newly swept, the webs brushed away, and the dingy windows cleansed. When I ascended to my room of the previous evening, I fund that the good work had extended even there. A cheerful fire was burning on the hearth, the broken chair had been removed, and so many little additions to comfort and convenience had been furnish- ed that the transformation was complete. I could easily guess who had done this, and what motive inspired it; Maria was ambitious to make her circumstances appear in the best possible light to one she had formerly known. There was no harm, and there might be much good in that. Just at dusk I was called to a plentiful supper, at which she presided, while the other wives of her husband remained in the kitchen. I subsequently discovered that Brother Underwood was not considered  strictly orthodox. He belonged to the Mormon church, and practised polygamy, yet he was not so liberal with .his money as the elders desired, and had on several occasions boldly refuied to pay his assessment -of tithes. He possessed, however, and in an eminent degree, one quality which Mormon   husbands especially nee'd, and which at all times and seasons they arerequired to exercise. This was good natnre, and that easy sort of dis- /  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8190-00000015"/> 28       THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. position, whiqh rests satisfied with getting along "some- hiow." If things went wrong," oh well, never mind." If the meals were not prepared by the right. time, or not at all, it made little difference to him. He would roast a potato, or munch a crust, and expected to live just as long as though everything went on in the smoothest manner. His wives generally partook of the same qualities. They were "the laziest set it .was ever my fortune to behold, and the five did not perform on an average the ordinary work of one good housewife in the Eastern States. Yet strange aso it may appear, Underwood had married them solely with the view to, their labor. He wished to keep a hotel or boarding- house without the extra expense of servants.  When Maria's health failed, and she could not perform the duties  devolving on. her, instead of hiring a girl he married another wife. She refused to work, and he resorted again to the same alternative with no better success. Thus one after another had been added to his family with no advantage to him. Fortunately they bore few children, or his circum- stances would have been -still more embarrassed. These women divided their time pretty equally between visiting, sleeping, and going to church; one attending to the house- hold affairs this day, and another the next ; while such general concerns as washing and scrubbing were utterly neglected. Though these women were actually too indolent to quarrel, they had no domestic feeling, no interest in common with their husband to preserve order, ant promote the family welfare. In this apathy and indifference they strongly resemble the /             '*   SEARCHNG FOR INFORMATION.       29 servants, for whom they were designed to be a substitute. These things were obvious enough to a stranger; I deter. mined to ascertain whether or not Brother Underwood. regarded thein in the same light. I felt little delicacy in. broaching the subject, as the Mormon, unlike the Mussul- man, manifests little sensitiveness in regard to his wives. They will sit for hours relating their domestic experiences, vexations, and the motives that caused them to desire so intimate a connection with so-many women. Of course there will be different views, but in many cases it is my candid opinion that the husband is more to be pitied than his wives. One day, when our acquaintance had ripened into familiarity, I inquired of Brother Underwood if he considered polygamy conducive to the happiness of those husbands who practised He frankly replied, "Generally speaking, I do not. One thing is certain, it has been my ruin in a pecuniary view- uot that exactly either, but it has caused a stagnation in my affairs that to a person of different temperament would have occasioned madness or suicide.  Fortunately I take things easy, and never suffer myself to be worried, come what may."       ' No one, I believe who had seen his broad, smiling, good- natured countenance would have disputed this. "It seems to me  that you mightdo a good business at hotel keeping 'under-other circumstances," I remarked. i "No   one can be more certain of that than I am," he answered, broadly smiling; "yet I have given up all hopes ;                   d  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8190-00000016"/> 30       THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. ,of that; in fact I care no longer about it. One or two boarders at a time is quite enough. I wish to retain what little property I have succeeded in getting; I have no expec- tation of ever obtaining more." "Candidly and truly, do not you, who have tried both, consider the one-wife system to be the best pecuniarily, as well as morally and socially?" "Not a doubt of it," he replied; but uneasiness seems characteristic of human nature. Few men, I believe, are entirely satisfied with one wife. They find deficiencies in Tier which they seek to remedy, where polygamy is allow- ed, by taking another, and as no woman is ever perfect, the number from this same motive may be indefinitely increased.": "And no one knows exactly what a thing is until he has tried it," I replied. "Exactly so." "Do you not suppose that many who have tried polygamy would gladly go back to the one-wife system, could they reasonably do so?"  "I know it ; but a marriage once consummated is not to be readily abandoned. Justice to the woman requires its permanency." "And you find no difficulty in procuring second, third, or even the seventh or eighth wife:" "None whatever, so far as I am aware. It is evensaid, that the more wiPes a man has, the more he may have, especially in those families where labor is required of the  ,.*    "ARGE FAMLIES THE SOURCE OF DISQUIETUDE.   31 female members. I have been told that many girls make it a condition in .their courtship that their future husbands shall marry at least two other wives, in order that the cares and burdens of household duties, with the annoyance of children, may be lessened by being divided." "A practical view, certainly." "And one which serves admirably to banish whatever objections a female might reasonably have to married life. Most women strongly -object to being mothers to large families, and if such is the case it is decidedly against their wishes and wills. The'first child is welcomed,the second tolerated, the prospect of a-tthird occasions tears and re- preaches, and that of the fourth is attended with exhibitions of temper, ebullitions of spleen, fits of melancholy, and not unfrequently with actual dislike or hatred of the husband. Whatever unhappiness the want of children may occasion in some families and under certain circumstances-it cannot be denied by any one even tolerably acquainted with the facts of the case, that too many of them is a source of greater disquietude and- discontent to those that give them birth, and on whom during infancy and childhood the care'of them necessarily devolves."         t Likely enough ; yet what bearing has this on the system of polygamy?" "Much, very miuh. Where polygamy is indulged, few women ever give birth to more than two or three children apiece.

"But Maria was doubtless averse to your second mar- riage?" Without noticing my last remark, he continued: "I could point you to many women in Utah who are strong advocates of poiygamy, though their husbands are doubtful of its utility, and hesitates about practising it." I became subsequently convinced that there wag much truth in his statement, and was forcibly reminded of Lady Mary Wortley Montague's remarks, where she expresses her belief that the ladies in the Turkish harems lead the easiest and happiest lives in the world, and also of what a young lady of good sense and respectable position in society once said in-my hearing, " that. she would rather be the fiftieth wife of a rich man who could support her without the neces- sity of labor,- or the inthrallment of family affairs, than -the only wife ofone who would expect her to perform all sorts of menial labors, besides giving birth to and-rearing a dozen children."(a.) 9 *       I     fi   , -      .  .-  . -    / GLANCES AND GLIMPSES o        83 CHAPTER II. GLANCES AND GLIMPSES-COSTUME-SCENES IN THE STREETS, ETC. W HLE walking the streets of Zion my thoughts con- stantly referred to the great changes that a few short years had   sufficed to accomplish. Land rescued from savages and wild beasts; redeemed from the wild; elegant structures built; a populous city, rich in the various ele- ments of prosperity, and the resort of thousands of emigrants from all parts of the worId, is a great work to be, performed in half a score of years, more especially when its isolated con- dition, and the absence of all water communication with the ocean is considered. One thing is certain ; the Mormons, whatever may be the faults of their religious or social sys- tem, are not deficient in the energy and perseverance of the Anglo-Saxon race.   Yet not a  tithe of the country they nominally occupy is cleared or inhabited. Little colonies of Mormons are settled here, and there, at fifty, forty or twenty miles from the main settlement, to which, for various reasons they pay a semi-annual visit much in the same man- 2*  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8190-00000018"/> 34       THR HUSBAND IN UTAH.     , ner as the ancient Jews went up to Jerusalem. The appear- ance of these-people, when seen in the streets, is much infe- rior to that of the natives- of Zion, and you soon-learn to distinguish them. They are coarse and rude in manner, impudent, staring-and curious, miserably dressed in acos- tume half-way between that of the Indian and white man. You are surprised at the unmistakable marks of Indian descent that many of the younger ones exhibit.   The straight, well-proportioned figure, long coarse hair, .high cheek bones, and wary expression of eye and countenance betray to the most casual observer the mixture of races. One thing that strikes you as remarkable,'is the assem- blage of different nations to be seen in the streets. Gibrajl- ter itself can scarcely be more favored in this respect. Every nation in Europe, and every State in the Union has representatives here.- The tall Norwegian, fresh from his native pine forests; the Dane, probably a descendant of some sea-king of old; the blue-eyed German, meet, and probably salute you in a language whose strange unintelli- gible gibberish has no more meaning to your ears than the gabble of so many geese. These generally retain their national costume for a time, but sooner or later adopt that of the Mormons, which varies little from the usual style of English dress. Brigham Young, the patriarch, attempted to lead the fashions, and set out with a slouched yellow hat, much too large even for his large head, green frock coat, and- pants large in size and loose in fit, white socks, and slippers. He was, followed by some of the elders, though    COSTUMES.           35 the young men and dandies were so intolerably wicked as to prefer imitating the people of the world. Zion, like other cities, has its fashionable streets. In these some are dressed with foppish extravagance, and a great many in clothes of expensive material. You are tempted to wonder how so much finery ever found its way to such an out-of-the-way place. Of course, the ladies in personal adornment must keep up with their khsbands and lovers. The wives and daughters of the rich dress expensively, with good taste and effect. Many of them are attractive in appearance, and some would produce a decided sensation in any European drawing-room. These were objects of especial attention to the United States officers and soldiers, which' gave great umbrage to the Mormons: Many of the poorer class of women work in the fields. These adopted a costume something like the Bloomer, con- sisting of wide pants, gathered with a band around the ankle, short skirts, and a broad-brimmed straw hat of home manufacture, yet all the better for that. They were adorned  with knots of ribbon, and being rather jauntily worn on one side, had altogether a pleasant effect.  The arrival. of an emigrant train always occasioned. a great amount of bustle and excitement, and such arrivals were of frequent occurrence. Some were bound to Oregon, others to California, but by far the greater number 'Were foreign Mormons, who came to join their brethren in the promised land.

Even after that, they are s4p- plied with cattle, domestic utensils, food, clothing, and other necessaries at a trifling cost, until they are enabled to get a "start." .This seems to me a praiseworthy and humane policy. U'Thou shalt not oppress the stranger, for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt," said the great Jewish law-- giver; a maxim too often forgotten by our own people. These emigrants are a source of great wealth to the Mor- mon Church, besides being an important addition to their numbers. Many of them bring large sums in gold and sil- ver; others have strong hands and willing hearts to work, and thereby increase the material wealth of the country'; and all are blindly attached to their novel faith and creed. Such emigrants are precisely the kind of people required to bring out the resources of a State. Few " gentlemen " among them, and no " ladies " but all true-hearted men and women, inured to toil and hardship, with brawny shoulders, firm step, and coarse hands. Deficient in the exterior graces of polite education, they generally exhibit a strong native sense of right, and what is due from man to man. 'They soon found employment, and in most cases, were busy and satisfied. (b.) The exceptions were those of old people, who had left their native country for the sake of ending their days in thee society of their children, and who seemed to sadly miss the old familiar accociations of former years. I was always fond of the society of aged people, and some of these interested me very much, though I could neither speak   AN INTERESTING AGED COUPLE,      87 nor understand a connected sentence in their language, I was deeply struck with the appearance of two old Norwe- gians-husband and wife, who lived with their son and his family, in a small adobe house, on one of the principal streets. They had all the appearance of great age-long white locks, and bent forms, with that indescribable something in manner and countenance, which even among the rudest peo- ple commands veneration. They seemed inseparable-that old man and his equally ancient wife. When the air was damp or chill, you could see them sitting by the window. In warm sunshiny weather they often came out on the little porch, but it was easy enough to be perceived that the old people were not happy. There was an air of loneliness about them., They were home-sick-how could it be other- wise? They were too old to form new friendships, or seek new pleasures. They are tired of isolation from all the habits to which they have been accustomed through a long  and undoubtedly happy life, besides being disgusted with the condition of the things they find around them. The wife pines for her old neighbors, her little village church, the voice of her aged pastor, and the mounds in the tidy grave-yard, where her ancestors sleep. I missed them one day from the window, and still the next they were invisible. Then rumors came that the old Norwegian woman had fallen down in a, fit. Another quickly followed, that she was dead, and I felt a certain presentiment that her com- panion could not long survive. I attended the funeral, which was conducted after the manner usual in Norway    &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8190-00000020"/> 38 8      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. The joffin was borne on the shoulders of six stout foreign- ers, and followed to the place of burial by a large company of foreign men and women. First, and conspicuous among. them,) was the aged husband of the deceased, bending beneath the weight of unutterable sorrow, and looking older by several years, than when I had last beheld him, E He seemed utterly decrepid and helpless, and was obliged to lean heavily for support on the arm of his son. His frame was that of a giant, and he must have been in his best days of wonderful strength, though now, he shook and shivered as if under the influence of strong convulsions. The procession passed out into a little open plain, bounded by large rocks, and extremely desolate in appearance. It halted by an open grave, over which a solitary cottonwood waved its huge branches. After the usual preliminaries, the coffin was lowered down; when the old man tottered to the head of the grave, and sat down, with one long, earnest, straining look into its gloomy recesses. Then the son, tak- ing his station at the foot, opened a small book, and read from it in- his native- tongue, what I supposed to be the funeral service of the Norwegian church, during which the whole assemblage reverently uncovered their heads. Many of these were evidently illiterate, and somewhat, boorish in manner, but all seemed deeply influenced by unaffected-feel- ing. Several of the women sobbed and wept bitterly, and the reader himself paused at intervals, apparently overcome by the depth of his emotions. This exercise was succeeded by a few moments of silence, /    A BIURTAL.          39 when another person stepped from the crowd, End began a short address, perhaps eulogistic of the virtues of the deceased, or more probably a strain of exhortation to the living. His manner was earnest, and the tone of his voice solemn and impressive. He finished, when -a few.. handsful of earth were throwne into the grave, when those who had acted as bearers came immediately forward, and taking some shovels proceeded to fill the grave. While this was transpiring, the son took his former place, and some one in the assembly -raised a hymn, with a long, slow, mournful air. The strain was immediately taken up by many voices, while the echoes rolled and died away in musical cadence among the hills. I was deeply affected, though unable to under- stand a syllable. Meantime, a man had gone into the ravine near by, whence he- returned with- two small branches with green leaves, that he had broken off a chenopodiaceous shrub, native to the place. He approached with the apparent intention of erecting them at the head of the grave, when the old husband, who had sat immovable, his face buried in his hands, made a hasty gesture of dissent, and pointed to a dwarf pine growing on a small mound at a little distance. The man understood his mistake, and throwing down the shrubs, proceeded to'gather the pine boughs, with their green tufts of long spiral leaves and pointed cones. These were placed upright at either extremity of the grave. A few sentences of prayer were then repeated in a low voice ; the old man, assisted by his son, rose to his feet, and all dis-  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8190-00000021"/> 40       THE HUSBAND IN"UTAH. persed. For. a day or two I thought much of the old Nor- wegian, and the probable effect which the decease of his wife would have on him. Then I took a short trip to a neighboring settlement, where I remained nearly a week. I purchased a horse, and returned by a bridle-path, leading near the old wonman's place of burial. Suddenly my horse -pricked up his ears, as if listening intently, and in another moment the loud echoes of a martial strain reverberated through the woods. Riding on, I soon discovered that another funeral was proceeding. The singers were standing around a new-made grave, chanting with most impressive utterance anrid gestures, the national air of Norway, and simultaneously bursting into a chorus, of which the burden, prolonged in a loud, full-toned, enthusiastic aspiration was, "Gamle Norge." I reined ln my horse till the pine branches were erected, when the company peaceably dispersed, and all that remained to earth of the old-man, was left sleeping quietly by his wife. Upon inquiry, I found that he had been a patriot and a warrior, and that his name was honorably mentioned in his native land.(c.) Many emigrant trains on their way to California or Ore- gon stop at the Mormon city to obtain rest and refreshment. This is obviously a great advantage to the country; and con- fributes largely to its wealth, by furnishing a market for all kinds of produce. These trains are not the least remarka-  ble feat'ire of the western world.' They come from all quarters-Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Missouri, and such a combination of strange characters rarely and perhaps   AMERICAN RESIDENTS.        41 never meet under other circumstances.  Each -family is generally furnished with a large stout wagon drawn by mules or oxen, in almost fabulous numbers, and capable of accommodating quite a number of people. Hoops, bent to form a half-circle, with a coarse white cloth stretched over them, make-a- passable cover. These are attended by men on horseback, with hunters and half-breeds on foot. Many a time emigrant parties double in number while journeying across the plains. The Americans, or those who had resided for several years in the States, were, usually well-dressed, though mostly rough and coarse, and generally fond of spirituous liquors. The men were not sociable, except when the prices and qualities of land, or the abundance of gold in their prospective home, was the subject of discussion. This, r . however, I attributed to a sort of jealous fear of the Mor- mons, whom they had learned to regard as enemies, and whose movements they incessantly watched. They took care to show the handles of concealed weapons, and man- aged fire-arms with dexterity, though carefully avoiding all altercations and disputes. One -thing was particularly observable in many of them-a Straining after effect, and an attempt to make themselves appear more wealthy and intelligent than. they really were. Their language was generally ungrammatical, idiomatic, and extravagant; ex- cessively profane, and interlarded with obsolete phrases, and nicknames applied almost indiscriminately. Yet one of these men, who had acquired some little property, and felt t                  ' I   &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8190-00000022"/> 42       THE, HUSBAND IN UTAH. very large in consequence, though he could neither read writing nor write his name, had the impudence (what else can we call it?) to cause himself to be nominated as can7di- date for the legislature of his native State, was supported, by an independent ticket, and obtained the office, after which he .aspired to be governor. Failing in this, he con- ceived the idea of going West, where his talents would be better appreciated.  Hence he had gone  roving about, always dissatisfied because the people refused to( trust him with some high  office. He was evidently a singu- lar man, uniting in himself the confidence and self-possession of the well-bred gentleman, with the coarseness and low tastes of the uncivilized boor. He would exhibit in one day the most opposite qualities. Frankness and reserve, recklessness and self-control, penuriousness and prodigality., I was told of one act which he originated and carried through the legislature, and which empowered each of the members to purchase at the public expense a leather trunk, dressing case, and gold pencil of the value of ten dollars. Could ariything  show the man in a clearer light? It was amusing to witness the sharp eyes with which these men regarded the movements of their women when the Mormons were about.

In one of the trains en route for California was a beautiful girl, of most bewitching manners, slightly addicted to coquetry and remarkably fond of society. Her mother was dead, and she had inherited from her a small property, which she lavishy expended in dress and ornaments. Her father, a man of naturally kind ,and humane disposition, with true parental feeling attempted to restrain the faults of his child. During their journey she had little opportunity to exercise her levity of disposition, but once encamped in the imme- diate vicinity of a populous town, and that' town a military post, she determined by present indulgence to make amends for past restraint. Her beauty soon became the general topic of conversation, at least among  a certain class, and her little coquettish arts delighted and excited the young soldiers -in no small degree. Several of the younger Mormons seem- also struck with her fascinations. Like most other women, however, she preferred a military uniform, and when a young lieutenant became her constant attendant her happiness seemed complete. Meanwhile Mr. Scott, the father, forbade her lovers approaching his tent, and reprimanded her severely for encouraging them. A scene ensued. The father was violent, the daughter impetuous. He threatened her with punishment; she defied his power.   That night shoe fled.

Friendship among travellers is of rapid growth. Utterly ignorant of what had occurred, I went the next day to his tent, and found him in a state bordering on distraction. He knew her recklessness and impetuosity, and doubted not that she had rushed headlong into the most deplorable evils.

"I certainly should not, except for your own words," I replied; " but what occasioned it?" "Those cursed Mormons, sir, those cursed Mormons were all the time. running after her. I forbade their coming, and talked Either savagely to her-too much so, sir; a father should never indulge his passions towards his children-- never sir-that caused my daughter to run away."' "Perhaps she will come back." "Never, sir ; she's too much grit for that. She'll never come back unless she's brought back-,sir, brought back by main force.

It is much more probable that some one of these young officers has deluded her." "Do you think so?" he inquired meditatively. ' I certainly do." "I should like to know your reasons."   A VARIETY OF OPINIONS.        45 "I believe that Miss Scott was rather partial to the military." "And I know she was," interposed the stepmother, who had been a listener to our conversation, and who manifested little disturbance at her daughter's flight. I was sincere in this belief, and circumstances, as I con- ceived, warranted the full expression of them, not only that the ends of justice might be met, but to prevent a collision between the Mormons and the exasperated travel- lers, which must result fatally ,to the latter. "What shall I do, sir, what can I do?'" he inquired. "The camp will be moving in a day or two-and to leave my daughter, sir, I cannot think of such thing." Not knowing what better to say, I simply remarked, "I presume not." "If she prefers a rascally soldier to yourself, I should say, let her go, observed the step-mother. Her husband silenced her with a look. Others of the emigrant party came in, and expressed great exasperation. Some persisted that the Mormons had kidnapped or abducted the girl, and proposed all sorts of violent measures to effect her rescue. Others contended, with much more show of reason, that she had voluntarily sought the protection. of a lover.

RURAL SCENERY-RURAL LIFE-JUDGE WHTE-HS OPINION OF POLYGAMY--THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THAT INSTITUTION. SOME of the Mormons are wealthy, and not a few have fine farms at some distance from the city, besides town- houses of considerable pretensions to architectural elegahce. Of course they would suffer in comparison with the buildings of New York, or other eastern .cities, though in this place they really look well. Usually these men have several wives with families. The first wife, with two or three others, resides on the farm probably, while the others are supported in the city, or it may be the reverse. The husband revolves between these two establishments ; blessing one place with his presence for perhaps a month, and then staying an equal length of time at the other. I understand that these husbands are greatly petted; each wife vieing with the other to best entertain her lord. As the dispositions of women are various, in certain instances this may be the case ; in others it is not. It was a fine, warm, bright morning when I started on a   t XsA DISAGRREEARLE PARTY.                  49 stroll with my fishing-rod up City Creek. This stream is rapid and beautiful. It runs from a wild gorge on thesnorth side of the city, along the banks of the principal canal, conducting the water for distribution into one part of the town. The stream was full of trout, waich, however, declin- ed to bite, and I resolved to visit the farm of Judge White, which I knew could not be far off. Certain business connec- tions hard led me to form an acquaintance with this man, who was considered a pattern saint, and who, at sundry times, had pressed me to share his hospitality. Striking into a narrow path I walked rapidly along the edge of -the plateau at the base of the mountain, for about two miles, when I came suddenly on a little mud shanty of indescribable appearance. It seemed to swarm with children. A parcel were playing at the door when I approached. Seeing me, there was a hurried ejaculation, and they ran in quickly to communicate the news. Three men immediately came out, and double that quantity of women showed their faces at the door, while the lesser ones behind were pushing and crowd- ing to obtain a glimpse. My approach had produced a sensation more than I considered safe or agreeable. Two of the men were half breeds; the other the most villainous looking white fellow it was ever my misfortune to behold. Snaky glittering eyes, shaggy brows, and sensual mouth, with an expression of countenance at once malicious, cunning, and devilish. The women were suitable matches for such met, nearly naked and undescribably filthy. I approached them frankly. The white man held out his hand. Not wishing 3 &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8190-00000026"/> s0o      THE HUSBAtND IN UTAH. to encounter the grasp of such a man, I tobk no notice of the action, but inquired if he could direct me to the residence of Judge White. "Judge White?" he reiterated. "Really, stranger, but come in here, and we will see," motioning towards the cabin. This movement revealed the handle of a concealed dirk. That, however, was nothing of consequence ; weapons, in this coun- try, being considered a necessary appendage to every man. "No, sir," I replied. "Have no occasion. Will you direct me?"  - "Walk in, and we'll have a game," he said, drawing a pack of cards from his bosom, where they rested side by side with the dirk. I declined in the least offensive manner I could assume, satisfied that the lman had evil designs towards me. "But I say you must, stranger," he continued, with an attempt to be facetious, with ended in a hideous leer. "It isn't often that anybody comes this way, when they do, we must be. civil and obliging. Now there han't'been better liquor to be had around here since old Noah came out of the ark, than I've got in yonder. I want you to go in and taste it, come," and he grasped me by the shoulder, attempting to drag. me forward. He was a powerfal man, broad-chested, and long-limbed, and his grip was that of a vice ; but I shook him off, and ran; yes, ran, with all my might across the plain: I heard a great shouting-and-laughing at my expense, but no one followed me.. Wandering about in one direction and another I became   JUDGE WHTE'S HOUSE.         51 thoroughly wearied, when ascending a small eminence the house I sought appeared before me. I had heard it described so often that I knew it instantly. It was a large adobe house, two stories high, with a piazza running all around. A pretty stream of'water coursed rapidly a short distance in the rear, and being lined with a growth of trees, it had an Eastern appearance truly refreshing. On the other side of the way was a large and convenient barn, with other out- buildidgs, suitable for the rearing and sheltering of stock. The house was surrounded by a good fence, with very neat gates. The yard was intersected bygravelled walks, with beds of flowers on either side. I noticed some very beautiful flowering shrubs peculiar to the country, and others also of which the seeds had been brought from the East. Two or three stout healthy-looking boys were playing on the grass, and the sound of a spinning wheel mingled with singing came through the -open door. "Judge White lives here, does he not;"I asked of one of the boys. "Yes sir," said the little fellow, with a smile of intelli- genee. ' Is he at home 1"I asked again. "Down at. the stable yonder," said the boy, pointing to a large new-building. "The Devons are there, too ; he thinks a great deal of them." While I was speaking to the child, a good-looking woman came to the door, courteously saluted me, with an invitation to "walk in."  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8190-00000027"/> 52       THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. "Run, boys, and tell your father that a gentleman wishes to see him," she said, addressing the children who scampered off with great glee. I followed her into a large and handsomely furnished room; carpets covered the floor ; there was a neat, well-filled book- case, a mirror, several pictures, fancy chairs, a sofa, and elegant harp. Bouquets and vases of flowers were tastefully arranged in various parts of the room, and there was that comfortable pleasant air, in which most Mormon homes are sadly deficient. Handing me a chair, and seating her- self nearly opposite, she prepared to act the cheerful enter- tainer duringlthe absence of her husband, and commenced by asking me if I was a stranger in the Mormon country, td which I made- a suitable reply.  "And how do you like our people?" she asked. * My answer -as rather equivocal. "Better than I ex- pected." "I admire your intelligence," she said with a bland smile. "We- have been greatly -misrepresented. People who come among us as a general thing, are much too prejudiced to form a cool dispassionate judgment of our institutions. They see and report only one side; this is scarcely fair?" I answered that it was not. The extreme cases of female suffering and unhappiness reported in the'books and papers which circulate through the Eastern States, are by no means general. I am told, however, that formerly it was much more the case than now. Opposition to polygamy is the effect of habit and education.   53' POLYGAMY A PATRIARCHAL INSTITUTION. Females become -reconciled to it by custom. Perceiving that she was -willing to discuss the matter, I said that among civilized nations, polygamy-had generally taken the name of a crime, that I believed it was rarely attended with donmes- tic happiness, and that few women .would be allowed to tolerate a rival in the affections of their lord. She answered that jealousies and heart-burnings in such cases were preposterous, and that if there was a class of women on earth who were really and truly objects of pity, it was the wives of small farmers and poor mechanics, who, generially speaking, were nothing more than household drudges-doing work of half-a-dozen, though unable to work at all. "You refer to the States?" "I do,-where thousands of women are expected to bear and rear from six to one dozen children apiece, besides all the cooking, washing, scrubbing, making, and mending for their families.

Bathsheba, the fourth or fifth wife of David, was the-lineal progenitor of Christ, Here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Judge White. He welcomed me to his house with great cordiality, excusing himself for not coming sooner, by saying, that he had just purchased some very fine Devons, and wished to superintend feeding and stabling them. Many of these Mormon farmers pay great attention to the breeding of stock, and no country in the world can boast a superior quality of butter and cheese. The bunch grass, indigenous to the climate, gives it a peculiar yet most delicious flavor. ' Accompanying Judge White, over his extensive farm, I was surprised and delighted with its judicious arrangements. Whatever may be the errors of Mormon theology, or the evils of its social customs, it certainly does not disqualify a man for the business of life. I have rarely seen a place on which everything was more admirably contrived for comfort, convenience, labor-saving, andJonuomy of space. The sta-, ble was a model of its kind, and the animals were sleek, docile, and kind; soft and pliant of skin, abundant. milkers, and excessively fond of the bunch grass. There are extensive bottom lands on this farm, subject to 'be flooded by freshets, when the snow melts on the moun- tains. Here, the cows are, pastured usually with the assist-- ance of " herders," who are paid for their services-by monthly wages. These fellows were sitting on rocks quietly tuning :'    AN ABRUPT QUESTION.        65 a rude pipe, or lying at full length on the grass -beneath the shade of cottonwood trees, while the cows were feeding )  a little way off. The whole scene was suggestive of the pas- toral ages. The lands devoted to wheat and corn, were rather ele- vated, and of very fertile soil., The wheat was heading, and gave promise of an abundant harvest, and the long sward- like leaves of the corn, were of the rankest, deepest green, and rustled pleasantly ap we approachedL There were extensive fields of potatoes, a large garden filled with vegetables, and a young peach orchard. Several laborers were employed on the farm, and I learned that wages were much the same as in -the Eastern States. At tea-time we returned to the house, and were ushered. into the dining-room, where we found a table abundantly furnished with the good things of life. The lady with whom I conversed on my first arrival, presided at the table, and I was introduced to three several Mrs. Whites whom I had not seen. We all sat down together. There were no exhibitions of ill temper or moroseness, and I could not help wondering whether or not was this good nature affected, and what scenes were reserved for the special enter- tainment of the judge. When the supper was finished, I was left alone with the judge for a time. The conversation had flagged for a few minutes, when my host abruptly asked what I thought of Mormonism. The question was sudden and unexpected, and I hesitated to answer it. He laughed outright, saying, You do not know what to think!"   &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8190-00000029"/> (56       THE HUSBAND IN UTAH.- "Indeed, I do not," I answered. "And why not?" "Because no one can form a- just idea of' a people until he has seen them, nor even then without the exercise of great sagacity and judgment, especially if their institutions should be different from those to which he had been accus- tomed." "A wise thought, happily expressed," said Judge White, "though the usual custom of tourists is to run through a country, selecting and sketching the most prominent. objects, looking out extreme cases and supposing them to be general, and then, after a large blank is filled up entirely from the imagination, the world receives the benefit of swallowing the; crude and ill-concocted mass. Our people are not per- fect by any means. The Mormon church requires reform. I am not perfectly satisfied with the system as it exists among us, but in this age of the world, where free opinion is universally tolerated, no two people think alike. What one considers a deformity is regarded by another as a great beauty, and the very thing that one desires to preserve, an- other will wish to purge. We must take things as we find them, though beneath a standard of imaginary excellence. The same course is necessary in your own churches." "I am aware of that." "I used to be frequently-amused, when listening to dis- cussions on the relative and comparative merit of the differ- ent churches. How common was the remark, "I don't think my Church perfectly right, but only the nearest right. But   CONVERSATION  WITH JUDGE WHTE.     57 whatever may be the faults of Mormonism, polygamy is not   A of the number." I was glad when he touched on this point, feeling some delicacy in introducing it. "Is not?"I replied inquiringly. "One Mormon gentleman with whom I conversed, and who had several wives, objected to the whole system, and expressed regret that he had ever been tempted to adopt it. I referred to Brother Under- wood. ' Is he a man of property?" inquired White. "Some considerable." "Then he has probably been unfortunate in the choice of his wives." "Very likely."  "Still that proves nothing against the system. Have you  never heard men with only one wife express regret that they were ever married?" "Frequently." "Yet you never set it down as the fault of the system, but that of the individual." "Even so, thou'gh I have thought, and still think, that there is more unhappiness in marriage than in celibacy. To early marriages and the necessity of supporting large families without previous provision being made for them, nine-tenths of the poverties and miseries in our large cities may be attributed." "I believe it," he replied. "Among us it is the custom to obtain the consent of the first wife to the second mar- 3*  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8190-00000030"/> 58       THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. riage, not because the law requires it, but as a matter of domestic policy." And do the first wives consent to this willingly?" "Generally they do," I am told. ' Of course your wife did." "Have you been conversing with her?" he inquired archly. "A short time this morning." "She had no complaints to enter?" "Nothing of the kind." "She gets along admirably. The same as a mother with her daughters. I never entertained a thought of taking the second wife, till she, herself, made me the proposition. We had a very large dairy; it made abundance of work, and help was scarce, with high wages. What was still worse, the hired girls, if reproved, or required to do anything not perfectly agreeable, would get offended and go away, leaving us in the lurch. On one such occasion, when Betty ran off with a half-breed Indian without giving us a moment's warn- ing, my wife thus addressed me : "'My dear, I am utterly disgusted with this system of hiring girls.' "' So am I; but what are we to do? You cannot possibly bear the whole burden of labor.' "' No, I can't; but you can take another wife.' "'Take another wife,' I said, surprised that she should propose the matter so bluntly. "'Certainly; why not?' she answered. ' There is Sarah   THE JUDGE AND HS WIVES.       59 Fogg, a most excellent dairy-maid, and a girl of good dispo- sition. If you could marry her it would be much better than to hire a servant. She would take more interest in the work, and I think we could get along quite as well together. What do you say?' "'That I will do so, if you wish it.' And the next month Sarah Fogg became my wife. Since then, I have united with others, as it seemed expedient." "Expedience, then, is the governing principle in Mormon marriages ." "Sometimes, though not always," he replied. "Many women are ' sealed' to a husband for the sake of salvation." This absurdity was too much for my gravity, and I could not suppress a smile. A shade of displeasure passed over his countenance. It was but momentary, however, and he became serene and cheerful. Is it possible, I thought, that a man of such seeming intelligence and probity can cherish ridiculous notions, or is all that I have heard of Mormon hypocrisy, indeed, true? Perhaps he guessed what was pass- ing in my mind, though too well bred to manifest anger. We were soon joined by the ladies, all wives of my host. I believe they were all very industrious, and so many hands certainly made labor light. They came in, each with her knitting work, and alt apparently cheerful and contented.

When the music ceased, and I had complimented her execution, which was very good, her husband informed me, that she was the daughter of a wealthy New England family, who, becoming converted to Mormonism, had abandoned their home and friends, and emigrated with the saints. He considered her courage, perseverance, and eminent love of truth, as most remarkable, and said these qualities first won his regard. When -bed-time approached, the ladies took leave of each other, with a friendly good-night, and retired. "Do you prefer to sit up late?" inquired my host, look- ing at his watch, "it is now past ten." "About my'usual bed-time," I replied, rising. Judge White rose also, took a silver candlestick from the table, and said that he would show me to my room. I fol lowed him up stairs, to a very comfortable chamber, neatly furnished. He sat down the light, politely hoped that I would sleep well, bade me good-night, and went out shutting the door behind him. The bed was good and well made, the apartment fresh and airy, yet I found it impossible to sleep. Judge White and his wives, their seeming intelligence, yet absurd and depraved ideas, filled my mind.

I had beeun aught that it was a holy ordinance, instituted by the   Almighty, and that a union thus consummated would be per-  t petuated in another world. But to sanction and excuse poly-  gamy, my Mormon friend had taken an entirely different view   of the subject ; he had divested it of every charm only mere  practical utility; his connections were purely sexual, with  neither romance nor sentiment to clothe and adorn them i How would my pious and venerable mother'regard such  sophistries?

Descending from my chamber to the sitting-room of the^ previous evening, I found the table laid out preparatory to  the morning meal. It was covered with a cloth, white as  the snow on the mountains. The dishes were stone china of  elegant pattern, and the knives and forks had been rubbed    BRiARFAB  T.          . 63 aid poed until they shone like a mirror. The food was brought   iisby the two  first wives of the judge, and break- fast was an ounced. The two milkers had not yet come in, and we sat. own without them. I have rarely seen a table better provided with good substantial edibles. There were fried fowl, and fried bacon and eggs, with cold ham and game. Therwre were preserved strawberries and honey. There were cold wheaten bread, and hot corn bread, hot biscuits, and hot shortcakes.  There were home-made butter and cheese, with most excellent coffee. A pitcher of milk stood on the corner of the table, and glass tumblers were placed by each plate to receive it when wished for. Judge White made a short extemporary prayer, nowise different from those usually delivered on such occasions-thankiug the Lord for the bounties- of nature set before them, and the revelation of divine truth which had enlightened their minds. At the conclusion, the females pronounced  Amen"  with one voice, and their lord requested me to "help myself," though without waiting for me to do so, he commenced iling the delicious viands on my plate. I ate heartily, and my host was evidently delighted. " Don't you think the patriarchal institution works admi- rably in my family ?" he inquired.(d.) " It seems to," 'I answered. There is no seeming about it," he said quickly, "it is all real-matter of fact. Don't you believe it ?" "Certainly I have no reason to doubt it."

I have more than once suspected them of injuring my cattle  and once I caught them in the very act of dressing one of my sheep." ".Are they Mormons?"I inquired. "They come under the spiritual jurisdiction of our pro- phet, though they have no faith-no religion of any kind. We have made great efforts for their conversion, but without success." "They seem to have adopted Mormon institutions. I saw several females with them." "Yes ; they have two or three wives apiece, and I don't kntow how many children." "Does the system do well in their case?"I inquired. "I should expect not, very," he replied. "If I had the laws to make, such fellows should not get married at all." I looked surprised, perhaps inquiringly. "No one should have the privilege of getting married, who had not made provision for taking care of a wife." Thinking that the conversation might be profitably changed, I inquired what he thought of the general condi- tion and character of the Half-breeds. His observations and opinions might not be of much value here, though they verified. my own experience of the same people. He said they combined the worst qualities-of the   THE HALF BREEDS.        65 Indian and white man, with little of the good belonging to either; were lazy, shiftless, improvident, and lived wretch- edly; rarely working at all, but depending for subsistence on the precarious supply of hunting and fishing, or the plun- der of fields and folds. I observed that they seemed quite numerous. "They are numerous," he replied, "more so than you would suppose from your short acquaintance in this country. There are hundreds, and, I verily believe, thousands of them of all sexes and ages." Mrs. White here interposed that some of the half-breeds were respectable, wealthy, independent men, far superior to the general class of Indians, and fully equal to the whites, whose opportunities for education and knowledge of the world had been no greater. "Oh, yes, my dear," he replied, " there are exceptions to the most general rule." He then stated as a grand cli- macteric to their depravity, that they were sadly deficient in religious faith; that neither their hopes nor fears of future punishments or pleasures could be excited; though he owned that they were disposed to relish and practise polygamy. I subsequently learned that though sufficiently numerous, their isolated condition, as individuals, precluded their form- ing a distinct class, and that the circumstances attending their births generally threw them into association. with the Indians. They compose the illegitimate offspring of white hunters, trappers, and United States soldiers, and Indian females. *,  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8190-00000034"/> - 66       THE auSJrAND DN UTAH. As the habits of these people are migratory, and they rarely occupy permanent residences, the mother and her child, or children, is usually left among her own people. The men are generally robust, capable of great endurance, though predisposed to intemperate habits. Their complexion is sin- gular, taking, in matured manhood, the color of a dark red berry; their features are those of the white man, with the black, snaky, glittering eye of the sons. of the wilderness. Like other mongrels, they are said to be short-lived, and ex- tremely liable to the attacks of infectious diseases. Some of the half-breed females are said to be models of womanly beauty, combining in the most exquisite degree the- lithe, agile figure and graceful proportions of their mother's race, with delicate features and clear olive complexions. These are frequently sought in honorable marriage by the whites, and it cannot be denied that they make good wivest and affectionate mothers; being, as an old trapper once  assured me, much more modest and humble, and much less. exacting and capricious, than their white sisters. The old fellow had good opportunities to know something about it, having shared his cabin with seven or eight different ones at different timed, and being, according to his own account, the father of nearly a score of children.  I saw many of these women in the Mormon city. They were quite as distinguishable as the, Quadroon women of the South. Some were residents with Mormon husbands, though the greater part were occasional visitors. They usually wore the picturesque costume common among Indian females of.

They embroider buffalo robes, woollen blankets, moccasins, and similar articles, in the most beautiful manner; are extremely skillful in knitting bead work-pockets, necklaces, and armlets; weave mats and baskets from the inside bark of certain kinds of trees and rushes, and practise other little arts of handicraft. These articles they barter for beads, those indispensable ornaments for the toilet of an Indian belle, needles, vermilion, and similar things, though they have learned the value of money, and prize it highly. , And thus it is wherever the white man treads. Love of gold, like a shadow, follows his footsteps, and all with whom he comes in contact are infected with the same selfish passion.  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8190-00000035"/> 68       THE HUSBB  D IN UTAH. CHAPTER IV. ALEXANDER BURNHAM-HS HOUSE-TRAGIC OCCURRENCES- WEDDINGS-DEATHS. HAVE described, perhaps with tedious prolixity, the order and decorum  manifest in. the family arrange- ments of Judge White; for the purpose of giving an idea of the phases which polygamy under certain circumstances assumes, and the arguments by which its votaries attempt to excuse it; yet this aspect must not be considered as a general characteristic, but only as occurring in rare and exceptional cases, where the disposition of the parties combine with pecuniary abilities, in a manner particularly favorable. Notwithstanding all that has been said and written of the sentimentality and romantic tendencies of women, I find by observation that as a general thing they are excessively practical. They ask husbands who can support them in ease and splendor, and so long as this is obtained care little for moral character and personal habits. Do not many in, all our large cities prefer living in style as the mistresses of   POLYGAMY.          69 rich men to being the lowly and industrious wives of poor tradesmen or mechanics? Even in the Empire State I have known women not averse to polygamy. Fifteen or twenty years since there lived in Onondaga County, a man named Warner, who owned three farms, with large brick houses, and supported a wife at either place., The dwellings were in one vicinity, and the women were good neighbors to each other, frequently visiting and otherwise extending little courtesies. The younger of these women had refused the hand of a respectable, but poor man, declaring that what she asked and would have of a husband was physical support above, the actual necessity of labor. Another man in the same State had two wives, who lived in two houses close together, on the same farm. Both had families, and the children ran and played together with great harmony. This man might often be seen at public places with his wives, one on either arm. They usually dressed precisely alike, and might readily have been mistaken for two sisters. They were very friendly, and never manifested a jealous or contentious disposition. A former acquaintance of mine is now living in the State of Ohio, with his two wives. The women seem perfectly satisfied with their condition, and assist each other in the performance of domestic duties, with great alacrity. Yet none of these women or their spouses were Mormons, and I have mentioned them to show that after all the Mrs.  Whites were not the unique and singular beings that some might imagine.  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8190-00000036"/> 70   -   THE iuSBAND IN UTAH. Now, even in Mormondom, if the females would unani- mously set their faces against polygamy it might soon be be abolished. Why they do not is referrible to particular causes. They have neither the time, nor opportunity, nor capacity for concerted action on the subject. Many of them, I verily believe, are well suited with it. Others consider it necessary because the elders tell them it is, and the remain- der, being the minority, are obliged to conform. How much the former are to be pitied I leave the theolo- gian and moral philosopher to decide; but the condition of the latter is most deplorable. Generally impulsive and passionate, they cannot view things with the cool expediency of Mrs. White, and not sufficiently superstitious to be governed in all their feelings and sentiments by the priest- hood, their souls revolt at the associations and connections in which they are placed. Their lives become a continued scene of bickerings, jealousies, and contentions, rendering themselves and all around them supremely miserable. In such cases, as Maria Underwood informed me, the most tragic occurrences are not uncommon, yet it usually happens that the affair is hushed up, and very few either hear or even suspect the truth,- I requested her to relate without exaggeration the history of these events. She smiled sadly in return, and asked me if I ever heard of a woman in the States stabbing or poison ing her rival through jealousy and hatred? "Certainly, I have heard of such things," I replied. "Then you can readily conceive what they do here under   POLYGAMY.          71 the influence of the same passions," she answered. Human nature is the same everywhere, and in some cases proves itself superior to spiritual wickedness in high places, though yielding perhaps to as great evils of another kind." She then went on to inform me that the most strenuous opposers to polygamy were those who came there ignorant of its existence, or those who with little or no faith in the Mormon doctrines, had accompanied their husbands thither rather than'be abandoned by them. "And do women, who are not converts, ever come here?" I inquired with some surprise. "Certainly they do," she answered. "There is Mrs. White." "And what is she?" "A believer in the doctrines of Fanny Wright." "Is it possible?"        " "Even so. She lived in Massachusetts several years, where she lectured on Woman's rights and other issues of the day." "She seemed very intelligent." "Of course, she is intelligent, no one doubts that." "But, Maria," I questioned, " can't you relate to me some of those tragic occurrences of which you have spoken?" "I could, though it might occasion trouble for me to do so." "What kind of trouble you Cannot, certainly, be afraid of your husband?"V "Not exactly afraid of him, but it is the safest here, I  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8190-00000037"/> 72-      THE HUSBBND IN UTAH. believe, as it is everywhere else, to see nothing, hear noth- ing, and know nothing. By professing ignorance I have frequently avoided trouble." "But such professions will not avail you now," I replied. She smiled, and rising, went to the door, opened it and looked out. "Whom do you fear?"I inquired. "No one," she answered, but proceeded to examine the windows. She then remarked, as if talking to herself: "They have all gone, I believe, but Underwood, and he is in the bar entertaining a drunken soldier, and will hardly- have time to play the eavesdropper." Then seating herself, she inquired: "Did you ever know, or have you ever seen Alexander Burnham?" "Never to my knowledge ; but what of him?" "Nothing of him, though what I am about to relate occurred in his family." "The same thing," I suggested. "Well, it makes no difference, but come to the window and I will point out his house ;" and she led the way. "You see that dwelling yonder, seemingly isolated, and occupying a picturesque situation on the elevated plateau?" I assented, remarking that I should suppose it -to be a very pleasant place. "It is," she answered. "The landscape is agreeably diversified with hill and valley, mountain and meadow, and presents altogether a rare combination of natural beauties; but the house-you just ought to see the house."   MRs. BURNHAM.          73 "What is there remarkable about that?"I inquired. "Nothing so very remarkable, when all things are con- sidered," she replied; "yet to one accustomed only to the square, plain, substantial buildings of the Eastern and Mid- dle States, it would be neither more nor less than a curi. osity." "What is it like?"I inquired. "It is a long, rambling, irregular concern," she answered. "At first it was a plain adobe structure, with three apart- ments on the ground floor, and as many above; but since then wings and lean-tos have been built, and domestic offi- ces, such as kitchens and nurseries, erected; these various rooms communicating with each other by closets or small and generally dark entries. "Then you have been there?"I said inquiringly. "Certainly, I have been there to both weddings and funerals." "And how many wives has Mr. Burnham?" "Only three at present,'? she answered. "To accommo- date these wives, the rooms are subdivided into suites of apartments, wonderfully alike in their appearance and ap- pointments. To describe one will give a general idea of all. Each consists of a bed-room, sitting-room, and closet, simply furnished with such necessary conveniences as civilized life renders'indispensable to neatness and comfort. Yet all the movables, the chairs, tables, curtains, glasses, beds, even to the scent-bottles and work-baskets, are precisely of the same 4  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8190-00000038"/> 74:      THE bugSBsAN) IN UTAH. color, quality and cost. In the living inmates of these rooms alone a difference exists, and that is difference indeed. "Mr. Burnham was a well disposed man, whose character exhibited a singular mixture of strength and weakness, wis- dom and folly: Though apparently wishing to make all around him happy,'his well-meant endeavors frequently mis- carried; through his own want of foresight and judgment. He had a pleasant voice, a kind face, and was generally liked as a neighborly, good sort of man. He was probably aware of his mental-deficiencies when he concluded to embark his domestic happiness amid the quicksands of polygamy. He might have considered himself asdto educe order out of that chaos in the family establishment, though it is much more likely that he thought nothing about it, but married his second wife, as most men do their first, from mere pas- sional attraction." "Had he been long a resident of Utah?" 1     u He came in with the first settlers, bringing his wife and one daughter. Mrs. Burnham was a woman of high pas- sions, great strength of character, and unusual mental power. She was tall and commanding in stature, moved with the majesty and grace of a queen; yet these exterior advan- tages were more than counterbalanced by a deficiency in moral and religious principle. "Though the daughter of pious parents, and educated by a mother particularly exemplary, she seemed utterly devoid of conscientious restraints. Public opinion, however, exer-   MRS. BURNHAM.          75 cised great influence overi her, and while many doubted her goodness of heart, no one could point to any open infringe. ment of the laws of society, or the fact of a lax morality. She was the senior of her husband by several years, and it was*hispered that the marriage on his part was one of ex- pedience, rather than affection. Whether as a consequence of this, or his knowledge of her unprincipled character, or both combined, Mrs. Burnham never acquired any great in- fluence over her husband's mind, though her love for him was of the most ardent and passionate nature. When the Mormon missionaries came to their native village, and his easy and credulous mind was won' to the belief of their tenets, she cared little, and said less. All religions, or none at all, were the same to her, and when he openly avowed his deter- mruination to emigrate to Utah, she readily declared her willingness to follow him, even to the ends of the earth, if he desired it. "Mrs. Burnham had always been conscious that her pas- sionate affection was not returned measure for measure, though she never found occasion to complain of neglect or ill-treatment. He was uniformly kind, and when a daughter was given to their arms, his demonstrations of tenderness were neither few nor feigned. Time, however, gradually effaced the novelty of paternity. The father relapsed into' his accustomed manner of coldness and constraint, and his wife solaced herself with a mother's cares, and their reward. ;  "Mrs. Burnham was one of those people who never weary in the pursuit of an object. She had determined during the  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8190-00000039"/> 76       THE HUSBAND IN TTAH. first year of her matrimonial life, that if she could not com- mand her husband's love, she would at least extort his praise by good management and attention to all wifely duties. And this laudable design she carried out by the most unremitted exertions. His appetites were consulted, his tastes gratified. His home was always pleasant, neat, and cheerful, and his table spread in the nicest manner. At evening the most comfortable place by the glowing fire was ,kept for him, and the easy-chair, slippers and newspaper provided to his hand. "Could Mrs. Burnham have found it in her heart to be satisfied with gratitude and 'esteem, anything in short but passionate affection, she might have been happy, though as it was, she continually pined and longed for the good beyond her reach. She felt that gratitude and esteem were cold and commonplace. She had given love, and she asked it in return. Thus several years passed away. "It is well known that some time elapsed after the rise of Mormonism before its peculiar doctrines were publicly proclaimed. Had Mrs. Burnham fully understood them, it is \ to be presumed that she would have opposed her husband's scheme of uniting with that people. But accustomed to comply with his wishes, she bade farewell to the scenes of her youth, without a tear, and almost without a sigh. "It is unnecessary to recount the incidents of their jour- ney. They arrived in Utah, and Mr. Burnham prepared a home for his family, and tried with a right good will to make them Comfortable and contented. But Mrs. Burnham dis- ' }   MRS. BTRNHAM.          " covered too late that she had taken a step most fatal to her peace. For the first time she had reason to reproach her husband for neglect. He would perhaps be detained from home on business of the church, leaving her without food or fuel. Then, too, she was shocked with the develop- ments of polygamy, but true to her woman's nature, she never for a moment wavered in her resolution, to be all and everything to her husband. This she conceived would guard him against the temptation to take another wife, and through weariness and grief, and manifold discouragements she toiled and struggled. "I Mr. Burnham had been absent from home two or three days, and returned unusually hilarious and cheerful, embraced his wife and kissed his daughter with a great demonstration of affection, and then sitting down, commenced a conversa- tion at once singular and unique. "'My dear,' he said, addressing his wife, 'we have a nice little place here, I think. It makes no pretensions, and it is cosy and comfortable. Amy's bright face is a great improvement to it. But Amy needs a companion. Now, my dear, would you have any objection to take a child, one of the finest and freshest creatures on earth?' "'A child I take a child I' echoed Mrs. Burnham   in supreme astonishment. "'Not exactly a child in years,' pursued Mr. Burnham, 'but a child of nature, simple, unsophisticated, enthusiastic, V and an orphan, the daughter of my old friend. Though she can play, sing, dance, draw, sketch, and write poetry, it is,  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8190-00000040"/> 78   -    THE HUSBAND IN UTAh. her misfortune that she could never learn to do anything really useful. She is much too delicate for household labors ; sewing she fears would spoil her fine eyes. She has no patience with children, and so is incapable of teaching, or attending on them. A being so helpless and guileless, with such a fine inaptitude for worldly affairs, must excite the sympathy of every man.' "' I believe, however, that few women would- fancy such an addition to their household,' said Mrs. Burnham. "' It has been revealed to me,' continued Burnham, with- out noticing his wife's remark, 'that it is my duty to adopt her into my family. The will of Heaven must be obeyed, whatever may be the consequences.' "A sudden and mortal sickness shot through the heart of Mrs. Burnham at this announcement. All her previous fears seemed about to be realized. Her husband loved another, and that loved one was about to'be introduced into her pre- sence, and to share her home. All her cares and toils, and the deep, deep love she had lavished on him had been of no avail. A fearful, a horrible thought flashed into her -mind so suddenly and with such distinctness, that it seemed the suggestion of another. Was it the tempting of a fiend? "That afternoon," continued Maria, "I paid Mrs. Burn- ham a visit. She received me with great friendliness, though her countenance bore the traces of great mental anguish. To my inquiries if she was ill, she returned the monosyllable 'No.' We had been on terms of intimacy for some time, and I pressed her to tell me what the matter was.

"'Only to think--to think that he intends to bring such a silly, coquettish, lazy thing- as she is here, and then to insult me with talking about her fine eyes, and her helpless- ness, as if I am going to be her slave-her slave, indeed i' and her countenance indicated some fearful purpose. I soon took leave, determining to watch the progress of events. "The next day Mrs. Burnham returned my visit. She seemed cheerful-even joyous. I was somewhat surprised at the change which such a short time had sufficed to bring about. She laughed outright. ' What is the use of mak- ing-fools of ourselves?' she said. 'My mind has changed much since yesterday; and I have called to request that you will not report anything I said in reference to this pro- jected marriage. It might create further difficulties.' "I assured her that I would not, with a feeling of pleasure that the affair was likely to terminate so happily. "The next week we were invited to the wedding-feast. There was a great company present; for Mr. Burnham was a noted man in the Church. , The apostles and elders were all there-some with two or three wives, and others with only one. . My attention, however, was chiefly engrossed b'y the bride, and the first Mrs. Burnham, who, it seemed to me, were the most dissimilar beings in existence The former  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8190-00000041"/> C80      THS HUSBAND IN UTAH. was a delicate little thing, with -rather a large head; but her face was fairy-like, her voice sweet, and she really looked charming.' All she said was free from effort, and spontaneous; and she had such a captivating gaiety in lier laugh, that it was fascinating to hear her. She'bandied jests with every one, and manifested the utmost brilliancy and enjoyment." "And the first Mrs. Burnham?"I suggested. "It would be difficult to give you an idea of her appear- ance. She was calm, yet rigid; and it was evident that her features and gestures were schooled for the occasion. Once, and once only, she was thrown off her guard, and then the nervous twitching of the muscles of her mouth betrayed a degree of internal agony painful to behold. There was a gleam, too, in her eye, as it followed the motions of the bride, that filled me with secret apprehen- sions I cared not to reveal. "The husband evidently wished the occasion to be a joy- ous one, and-between-demonstrations of tenderness for his new bride, acd nonsensical remarks, designed to excite the mirth of those present-acted, as I thought, excessively silly. One of the elders breathed an extempore prayer, when cotillions were formed, the twelve Apostles leading off in the first set." "Is it, indeed, a fact that cotillions are introduced with prayers?"I inquired. "It is; and the effect is most ludicrous. I could scarcely ,help laughing outright."   A MYSTERIOUS DEATH.         8 "A fitter subject for weeping i"I replied. "Well, every one to their mimd," she continued. "But I could riot help thinking that both exercises were remarkably similar-both seemed got up for the especial occasion. The new husband, in his zeal and fervor, quite outdid himself- balancing to this one, turning that one, and then whirling round his young wife for a final flourish, till she grew quite giddy. "The first Mrs. Burnham presided at the table. The dinner was excellent and abundant. After eating heartily, the whole company resorted to dancing again, which was kept up with little variation till late at night. And the, next day we were astounded by the intelligence that the bride was dead!" "Dead I How did she die?"I ejaculated. "EHow did she die? How often was that question asked I but who could answer? It was all a mystery. It was not even known when she died. An hour after the company dispersed, she was found by her husband in the portico of the dwelling, senseless and speechless. A physician was summoned, but the remedies- came too late, and before morning she expired. "We went to the funeral. The husband seemed incon- solable. The first wife was rigid and indifferent, though, when she approached to look at the corpse, I either saw or fancied that a momentary gleam of malicious pleasure flitted over her countenance. Amy, too, wept with unaccountable bitterness.

"And did Burnham relinquish the idea of taking another wife?" "Far from it. Before one month had elapsed, his versa- tile and fickle fancy had selected -another. The courtship was carried on with all that fond intercourse usual where no wife exists. The-day for the wedding was set, when the bride elect suddenly sickened and died. People thought it strange. The elders condoled with the afflicted brother, and many of them advised him to try again." "And his wife "-- "Carried herself as usual, though perhaps a close observer might have detected a greater degree of haughtiness in her manner, and a cautious reserve in her conversation, even with her most intimate friends. "That. season was proverbially sickly. Bilious and other fevers extensively prevailed. Mrs. Burnham was among the first attacked. I was summoned to watch by her bed-side. She was wildly delirious, and raved in a manner really frightful. I shuddered; listening to the revelations of her guilt. She avowed herself a murderess, and called on Hean ven to witness the truth of what she said. Her husband stood by, livid as chalk, and trembling like an aspen. She accused him of destroying her soul, by exposing her to such horrible temptations. I never saw such a death-bed before." May I be mercifully spared from seeing such again!"   DEATH  OF MRS.

DIzjwKjIENT SENTIMENTS-POOR CLASS OF MORMONS--MSERY OF WIVES-ETC. FIND that, even among husbands, the utmost diversity of sentiment, with regard to polygamy, prevails. It cannot be disguised that the whole system is indebted, for support, to the protection and countenance of the elders. These monopolize the fairest, most healthy women, leaving the old, ugly, and decrepid to be shared among their follow- ers. I have known some of the most virtuous and intelli- gent of these people to be exceedingly disgusted with what they saw and heard, though evidently cautious not to express publicly their feelings of disapprobation. Slavery and poly- gamy, both institutions of barbaric ages and countries, have this in common, that while increasing the luxuries of the rich, they add to the discomforts- and miseries of the poor. A poor man-by which I mean one dependent on his daily labor for the necessaries of life-will generally find the decent support of one wife, and her little brood, quite   COMPARISONS ABE ODIOUS.       85 enough for his exertions. But poverty exempts no one from the passions inherent to the race; and if a rich man indulges himself by taking six wives, his poor neighbor will imitate him as far as possible, and probably take two, though against his better judgment, and fully aware that his domestic happiness Will be thereby destroyed. In conversation with an intelligent Mormon, I inquired how it happened-that they were so well supplied with wo- men, as the proportion of the female population to that of the males was about as four to one.  He replied that the ranks were thus filled by the female converts to Mormonism. "You would imply, then, that more women than men embrace your doctrines?"I suggested. "A great many more," he replied. "'Women, in all ages, have been the most susceptible of truth, you know." "And of imposition, too," I replied. "The first believers and preachers of Christianity were women," he continued, without noticing my last remark. "And  the first convert to Mohammedanism was a wo- man," I answered. "Your comparisons are odious and unjust," he retorted, angrily. "The truth should. not be either," I replied. "Women, from their peculiarly susceptible temperaments, are ex- tremely liable to be charmed with novelties. While their devotional sentiments are more easily excited than those of the men, it holds, as a general thing, that her reasoning powers are much inferior; hence I question whether she is  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8190-00000044"/> -                       0 86       THE hUSBAND IN UTAH.       , as capable of perceiving and appreciating the truth as are the stronger sex."           ' My Mormon friend, however, did not seem inclined to discuss the subject further, and our interview ended with manifest displeasure on his part. Another with whom I conversed, considered this abund- ance of women as a providential interposition in behalf of the saints; and when I attempted to argue with him on the absurdity of such notions, he broke out in a ralediction, denouncing me as an infidel, Gentile, and heathen. It is a fact that Utah, as compared with other portions of our country, is disproportionately supplied with women, and many of them excuse or advocate polygamy for that reason. "Suppose," they say, " that only one woman was married to each man; then for one married woman you have three or four single ones. What is to be done with them? Shall we let them sink into vulgar, degraded, and abandoned habits, as they do in all your large cities? Shall their young affections run to waste? Shall the State be deprived of the children they ought to bear? And last, not least, mhust they spend their lives in a hopeless celibacy, because certain legislators have deemed it expedient to restrict the intercourse of one husband to that of one wife?" When i remarked that I should fancy they would be happier single than married, under such circumstances, "They don't think so," would always be the answer. "We have no difficulty in obtaining wives." I scarcely think they do.   CONDITION OF THE LABORING CrASST.  . A  87 The laboring- class in Utah 'are not so comfortably pro- vided for as might be wished, yet the question arises, Where, in the wide world, is not such the case? In civilized, Christianized, and' enlightened London, to marry two wives is- a crime considered worthy of transportation, though to let a next-door neighbor starve, yourself rolling in luxury meanwhile, elicits no reproach. New-York, the great, the spacious, the commercial, has its free schools and churches, side by side with dens of squalid poverty and haunts of crime. Where, I say, are the comforts of the laboring classes duly considered, or where do they take the position in society they are justly entitled to? It would be a hard  '. .' thing to tell. As a general thing, however, labor is more respected in Zion, than in any other city which I have visited; and laboring people do not form, as elsewhere, a separate and distinct class. This may be chiefly owing to the discordant elements of which society is composed, and which require mixture and fusion before the scum can rise to the top, or the dregs settle to the bottom. Yet I am inclined to think that it originates in the policy of the Mormon leaders; and, without looking further, we can find very good reasons why they should wish to have it so. Though accused of laziness themselves, the Mormon elders are " loud " against its being practised by others,'and take every occasion to enforce the duty and necessity, of industry. Of course, there is a class -of loafers, but these are mostly outsiders, visitors, and GTentiles.  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8190-00000045"/> 88       THE HtSBAND IN UTAH. Most of the mechanics, small farmers, and day-laborers, \ have each two or three wives. Some of these women are very industrious, though others are not. Indeed, I thought laziness more prevalent among them than any other class. Perhaps that is owing to polygamy.-perhaps to natural dis. position. I do not attempt to decide. But in this hetero- geneous; assemblage from different parts of the earth, a great diversity of character necessarily exists. In walking out, one morning, I came unexpectedly to a .miserable shanty, and called, to rest and look around. It was occu- pied by four women, all the wives of one man. One of them was weaving a kind of coarse cloth, and the' others did not seem to have anything to do. I ascertained that the husband was a blacksmith, who had emigrated from Cayuga county, in the State of New-York, but a few years previous. One wife only had emigrated with him. He found' the others subsequent to his arrival. They were aware of his condition, and that nothing better than a hovel could be afforded them, yet each one preferreds ar- ing this with the others and a husband, to living in celibacy. I inquired if the husband followed his trade, and received a negative answer. .            / "Why not?" "No particular reason, that I know of, except that he prefers to hunt and fish." "Prefers to hunt and fish, does he? And yet I should suppose that a rather precarious manner of gaining a liveli- hood." * .      X    A CHARACTER.          89 * "You would, ha? We live as well as our neighbors, sir-poor people, I mean-yet, if you have a trifle to give me, I should thank you, sir-I should, indeed!" I tossed a twenty-five cent piece into her lap, and bade 'her "good-day." My curiosity was excited to look further. The cabins which I entered were,usually occupied by two or three, and sometimes six or seven, very dirty women, and a group of ragged, squalid, miserable-looking children.' There was but one room and loft to each cabin, or, where there were two rooms, they were occupied by two families. They were very destitute of furniture, and without any ground floor. There was no glass in the windows; and the whole scene was com- fortiess in the extreme. I encountered one old fellow sitting near the entrance of a covered wagon-body, which had been removed from the wheels. His countenance had a simple, idiotic expression; and I approached, accosting him with the inquiry of, "What are you doing there, uncle?" "Nothing at all," he answered.

Thinking this idea to be a good one, I encouraged him in it, and passed on., Yet these were soli- tary cases. Entering a small' cabin by the road-side, I found two women, one man, and three or four children. The house and its furniture looked very well; so did the women and children; but a large bandage was bound over the face and one eye of the man, that gave him a grotesque appearance. "What is the matter with your face, friend?"I inquired. "Burnt it," he answered, gruffly. The women looked at each other with ill-concealed merri- ment, while the husband rose and went out. "I've a great mind to tell the stranger how it hap- pened," said one. "Do,"- answered the other. ' I should like to know, certainly," I replied. "Well," resumed the first speaker, "our husband is a little queer sometimes." "He always is," suggested the other. "For three or four years, however, when anything occur- red to rumple him, he would refuse to go to bed, and actu- ally sit up the whole night, dozing away his time in the rocking-chair." "Did he suppose that plagued any one but himself 1" "He knew very well that it plagued me ; but often I was as innocent as you were of giving him cause for offence.- If the' pigs got into the yard, he was mad about it, and wouldn't go to bed.

Sometimes, by coaxing and flattery, I would succeed in getting him off; but I grewtired of this, and concluded to let him set up till he got enough of it. Yesterday, he got sullen, as usual. Neither of us said a word, or took any notice of him. When bed-timae came, we retired, leav- ing him to his meditations. In the night we were awakened by a loud shriek. We fancied what had happened, but determined not to rise or go to his assistance, unless he requested it. We heard him going about the house, but he said nothing to us, and this morning his face was bound up, as you see. I suppose he got to sleep, and fell against the stove." "It will probably be a lesson to him," I said, though I could scarcely speak for laughing. "I should think so," she replied.  These women did not seem miserable.  have seen few that did. They have probably become accustomed to the prevailing state of things; and custom, it is said, is second nature. I believe that the manifestation of deep feeling, by the wife, when her husband takes his second partner, is exceedingly rare. Are they restrained by fear, or is it actual indifference, or do both these feelings come in for a share? Maria Underwood, to whom I mentioned the subject, declared that the greater part, though outwardly calm, were inwardly dying with grief, vexation, and jealousy, and attributed to-polygamy all the shiftlessne6s and laziness  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8190-00000047"/> s92      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. observable in certain quarters. I should doubtless have received the same impression, had I not been aware that similar habits existed among a certain class where polygamy was never tolerated. Yet there can be no doubt, I think, that it operates unfavorably on the mind of the. wife, by removing the great stimulus to the proper discharge of her family duties. St. Paul, a wise man, and accurate observer of human nature, thus remarks : "The married woman careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband." And there can be little doubt that the chief stimulus to exertion - in the female mind is the idea of pleasing the husband. "What will he say?-How will he like it?-Will it suit him?"-are the thoughts constantly recurring to her mind, though, when discouraged by his indifference, she becomes weary, careless, and aimless. Maria Underwood informed C  me of two or three cases where the first wife had actually poisoned or drowned herself on the advent of the second though, the second cared little or nothing when the third was taken. "Mr. Griscom formerly resided in New-Jersey, and was a member of the Presbyterian Church, yet few thought him to be a mnan of much principle, and many openly questioned his honesty. But he was wealthy, and wealth is respecta- ble.  Consequently his conversion to Mormonism made a decided sensation-a  sort of nine days' wonder-in his native village. Mrs. Griscom had riches in her own right, but the scheming husband had contrived to get them all in   AR EX-PRESBY'IXKIAN.        93 his possession, thus leaving her penniless for voluntary and separate support. When he proposed to unite with the Mormons, and emigrate, her friends iecidedly objected to her accompanying him. To this he maisted entire indif- ference, telling her to go or stay, whichever she preferred; but when she- mentioned her property, he told her plainly that he should not voluntarily relinquish one cent, and that the law, under the circumstances, would give her nothing. Not wishing to become a burden to her friends, she deter- mined to remain with him. "After innumerable difficulties and dangers, they reached Deseret, with a company of the first settlers. The country was wild, and inhabited by Indians ; but one thing was in their favor-they had the choice of pleasant localities. "Mr. Griscom made immediate preparations for extensive grazing. He justly concluded that milk, butter, and cheese would be in extensive demand;  and, to make sure of "help,': in 'the domestic department, he hired a great, red- faced, freckled, and- blowzy German girl, who immediately became a candidate -for matrimonial honors. Most men are vain, and Mr. Griscom was manifestly flattered by her endearments and attentions, while his poor wife looked on in insufferable agony. "A year elapsed, and the consequence of their intimacy became manifest. Mr. Griscom was a proud man, and she was not exactly such a woman as he would have selected, even for his second wife.' -But there was no alternative; she refused to leave the house, and in this determination the th    i  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8190-00000048"/> "       THE MUfSBAND IN UTAH. elders encouraged her. - Finally--and, it may be, for the sake of his child-his reluctance wasg overcome.  They were married in the evening; before morning she became a mother. On this occasion, the absence of the first Mrs. Griscom was observable.  Inquiries were made, but she could not be found. Two days elapsed, still she came not. A week went by, when some hunters discovered the body of a woman floating in the thermal spring. It was soon ascer- tained to be that of Mrs. Griscom. The poor lady, whose prospects of life were once fair and bright, had .been reduced to the last great extremity of committing suicide." "And how did he get along with his German wife?"I asked. "Extremely bad," she replied. "His domestic establish- ment embraces at this time six or seven more, but they are 'little better than, slaves. He appoints their daily tasks, and when they fail in the performance, punishes them. "For my own part," continued Maria, introducing the subject which I had longed to hear her touch upon-" for my own part, I didn't lay it to heart like some women would. Of course, I worried a little at first, but soon con- cluded it was no use to make a fool of mysblf. If Under- wood had grown tired of me, and thought another would suit him better, why, let him try it. I was never much given to sentimentality. I always considered marriage to be of all things most exceedingly practical. I could very well be contented with beef, bread, and butter, with or with- out the husband. As the formatidn of matrimonial con-   MARIA WARD'S PHLOSOPEY.        95 nections with another would not cancel his obligations to me, I raised no objections, but kept all the time thinking, with a slight variation, of the old song: "'I think light of him as he can think of me, Not a fig for an old man who 'marries two or three.' ( After the second wife came here, I determined to take matters easy, and I have done so." "And the others have imitated your example, I guess." "Yes; we don't all perform the labor that one indus- trious woman would." Another woman of intelligence and strict propriety in- formed me that the general tendency of polygamy was to make husbands either dupes or despots. If they were of an easy and moderate disposition, their domestic concerns would be neglected, and the utmost disorder, waste, and discomfort prevail-while, on the other hand, if they could and would bring themselves to treat thei wives like so many servants, they might get along tolerably well, though the happiness usually' experienced where one wife received 'all the affection and care of her lord, was out of the ques- tion. Many wives, she thought, brought themselves into a state of apathetic- indifference, but then they had little affection and no respect for their husbands, and generally managed to make them miserable. Her husband, she continued,. had married another wife soon after their arrival in Zion, and they managed to get .    &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8190-00000049"/> ' 9t}     THE HUSBAND. IN UTAH. along comfortably, and with little. quarreling-quarreling she always detested--but, as for taking care of his house or clothes since, she hadn't-done it, and didn't design to do it. She believed most men found it more difficult to get a but- ton sewed on a shirt, where their houses were filled with wives, than to have the whole shirt 'made where there was only one. "And are husbands often despotic? .That is, do they often punish their wives, to enforce labor and obedience?" Well, she rather thought not. She did not suppose it was very common, though the Germans and other foreigners had little mercy on their women,- One German that she knew, accustomed his wives to working in the fields, himself standing by, with a whip in his hahd, and looking for all the world like a Southern slavedriver. 'When reproved for such an exhibition of unmanliness, he excused the matter by say- ing that it was the custom in Germany, and he didn't see why the women were better here than there. "But'is there no law to bring husbands to account for such brutality?" She guessed not; had never heard of such a thing ; was pretty certain there-was not. The operating -laws of the Territory were all founded on the, code of, Mormon ; and husbands, according to-that precious document, could do no wrong. '- Then the safety of the wife, or wives, depends altogether on the naturally himaane disposition of the husband. If he    ILL-TREATMENT OF WIgVJS.       97 chooses to punish her, or make her a slave, he can do it with absolute impunity, and that, too, within a country famed for its enlightened and liberal institutions." I had frequently observed that most Mormon women were cautious in the expression of sentimnents adverse to the pre- vailing customs, and, before giving information on such points, required a promise of secrecy. To account for this, I subsequently learned that some of the more orthodox husbands chastised their wives for heresy-meaning by this, the manifestation of displeasure or opposition to Mormon institutions in the presence of Gentiles. This brutality on the part of husbands, however, cannot be justly attributed to polygamy. Husbands, uneducated, low, vicious, and sensual, have manifested the same tempers in the monogamous state. The ill-treatment of wives is a common topic of newspaper and neighborhood gossip, and of such frequent occurrence that no one wonders to hear or read of it. Even in our Christianized and enlightened State, wives are butchered, are poisoned, are subjected to all kinds of brutality, that would sicken- one's heart to hear of, if perpetrated in a distant country. I have never yet heard of one instance where a Mormon husband has actually and in cold blood murdered his wife. Would to Heaven I could say the same of those who are not Mormons I(e.) But there is a phase of polygamy which I have not , noticed yet, and which seems really cruel, though the mono- gamous system is aot exempt from the same or similar evils. 5  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8190-00000050"/> 98       THE HtSBAND IN UTAH. I encountered, one morning, in my walk, a poor woman, middle-aged, and faded, through- hardship and exposure. She complained that her husband had deserted her and her children; that her house was cold, open, and exceedingly unr omfortable; that she had neither food, fuel, nor neces- sary clothing; though her lord resided with a younger and fairer wife, in a sumptuous mansion, partaking all the plea- sures and luxuries of life. Upon inquiry, I found that provision for the wife was 'optional with the husband, and that if he chose to neglect or abandon her, she had no legal remedy. e   AN ENG6TISHMAN'S OPINION.     99 CHAPTER VI.

"But we shall probably get clear of both." "Far from it. Slavery has become already too deeply incorporated with your social and political system, and polygamy soon will be.

Their general treat. ment of women was rude, discourteous, and boorish. If a woman met one of them on a bridge, or at the streets crossings, she must turn and go back, giving him the way, at the risk of being thrust into the mud and water. In vehicles or churches, they always usurp and keep the best places.  At the table, they rudely appropriate the Mpst dainty pieces of vegetables or game. They seem to have no appreciation of any one's comfort but their own, and are quite as deficient of artificial politeness as of natural kind- ness of heart. I did not wonder that such fellows were polygamists in principle, though I really did wonder how they were ever enabled to practise it, as it does, or ought to, take two to make a bargain. ENGLISH EMGRANT MORMONS.(C.) About twenty miles from Zion, near an outlet of the Great Salt Lake, a company of English emigrant Mormons had squatted down, and I determined one day to make them a  visit. Informing Maria Underwood of my intention, she attempted to dissuade me, saying that she feared I would meet rough treatment. "iVhy so?"I inquired. "Because they will think you a spy, or something of that character," shereplied. "Are they then so afraid of strangers 1' I questioned. "Oh, I don't know what is the matter with them; but   A CALL ON BROTHAS WELLS.       103 they are singular, and have such strange notions, and are so insolent and impertinent, that I shouldn't like to trust myself among them." "If that is all, it is rather an inducement to go," I replied, and accordingly determined to start the next morn- ing. I was up early, ate my breakfast with a good appe- tite, and, being abundantly supplied with cakes by Maria, took my gun and set off across the plain. Though it was rather the wrong season for game, I congratulated myself with the idea that my appearance among them would be somewhat excusable on the plea of hunting. The morning was beautiful, the breezes fresh from the mountains, and the whole scenery delightful.  I pressed rapidly forward, but before five miles had been passed over, began to regret that I had undertaken such a journey on foot. Fortunately the residence of brother Wells was near. This man was a very good Mormon, had four wives, and, what was of infi- nitely more interest to me, owned several valuable horses. Of course, I did not wish to buy, but to hire one for a day or two. As I approached his dwelling, two or three dogs ran out of their kennel, barking and yelping; and presently a large aldermanic-looking individual came to the door, and, seeing me, advance, instantly came out of the house, and withdrew around .the corner. I followed him. tHe was standing near a small out-house, evidently awaiting my approach. As I passed around the dwelling, I heard evi- dences that hot work was going on within. Children were screaming, women scolding, and abusing each other in the  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8190-00000053"/> 104      THE HUSBAND  T UTAH, .  most vulgar language. The man looked worried, and half frightened. I didn't wonder why; for the horrible discord grew louder and louder, and I could hear to distinguish the profane and obscene words.     .- "Have I the pleasure of 'addressing Mr. Wells?"I   l inquired; but the noise from the house completely drowned my voice.             -            I "Sir?" he said, coming nearer, and looking towards tho window, which was literally filled with heads. "Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Wells?"I  repeated, making my best b6w.                i "Yes; that is my name. Yes"--advancing still nearer. There was a momentary pause in the domestic tempest-  curiosity connected with my appearance and business, over- coming anger for the time being. I took advantage of the   silence to make known my errand with as little peroration as i possible.                         I; "I should like to hire a horse for a day or two.

' You won't do any such thing 1 She sha  hv  the first red cent 1" screamed the vixen. 5*  .*  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC8190-00000054"/> 106      THE HUSBAND Im UTAH. "I will Hthat I will!" yelled the other; and she made a plunge at her antagonist. I expected to see the husband rush in, to put an end to the melee, but he never stirred.               i "Those women are fighting, sir.

"You will bring him back, of course, and not override or otherwise injure him?" "I will take good care of the horse," I replied ; "and return him safe and sound." I was obliged to raise my voice to a- pretty loud key, as the tumult from the house effectually precluded hearing common conversation. "This way," said Mr. Wells. "This way, sir." I followed, glad to escape" the uproar. He led me half way down the side of a small hill, to a well-built adobe stable, in which several noble animals were standing. The master entered, and spoke to them in a pleasant voice. p- They recognized him with a low neigh. Surely this man cannot be utterly' depraved, I thought--an affection for dumb animals having always seemed to me as inherent to a noble spirit.  ,   JO uaNE  Y TO SALT RIFS.       10 "I keep my horses stabled," he said, addressing me while preparing to adjust the saddle.

Here, also, the road forked-one branch leading directly to the lake, and the other bearing off to the southward. I took the southern -track, leaving the lake, of which I had just obtained a glimpse at my right hand. I paused for some time, to take in a view of the scenery, it was so wonderfully sublime, "grand, and impressive. ' The prospect to the north was uninterrupted for. a great distance, but, stretching away southward, the huge Alps of the Western World towered in majestic grandeur, the cradle of tempests and the birth--  place of a thousand streams.  Nestled  in their deepest recesses is the Utah Lake, a broad sheet of clear, fresh water, that ever holds a mirror to the purple heaven. Here Nature-seems to exult in sublimity. In outline, everything is massive, grand, and imposing.         * Following the slight traces of a road, we came suddenly upon a  singular vehicular establishment.

A  man, poorly dressed, and with a crownless hat, was lying on the ground, in the shadow of the wagon, while two hounds were squatting on their haunches, in close companionship.- The man eyed me with a  sullen stare, while- the dogs growled and showed their teeth. "Good-day, friend," said I, advancing. * *       ,          ^  *  \ '   * *   BIsOr -TOWN.         109 He barely noticed my salute.

"I don't see why ye can be Wanting to go there," he replied, without looking up. "I don't know that it matters why," I answered; "though if you would give me the direction, I should esteem it a great favor." "Well, yes.

"But you'll know it when you reach it; and then keep right on through that, till you see the houses. You can't miss it." I Not seeing any probability of obtaining more perspicuous directions, I thanked him, and rode on. I did, indeed, know the sand when I came to it, which was very soon. It was deep and heavy, with a vegetation of large flowering cactuses; but, fortunately; it did not extend far; and I soon came in sight of a long, low fringe of green, which I knew to be a belt of cottonwood trees, such as always in this country line the margin of the streams.- I soon came to the village. It was a cluster of wretched; mud-hovels, with pig-sties close to the doors, and miserable little gardens, growing nothing but -weeds. There seemed  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8190-00000056"/> 1[0      THE HUSBjAND IN UTA.    - an abundance of women, children, and dogs, tnbugh but little of anything else. Few of the houses had either win- dows or doors, and their only furniture seemed to be old barrels, boxes, and such like lumber. Of course, I attracted great attention. Heads were thrust from the windows, and the little, low doors were crowded with women of uncouth shape and feature. I have scarce ever seen females, of any age or country, more decidedly ugly. They laughed, leered, and talked to each other in a loud voice, as I passed by. Approaching one of the hovels, which had an air of decency, compared with the rest, I alighted, hitched my horse to an oldr cart, and went in. The air of the- apart- ment was almost suffocating, so hot and offensive, and great untidiness prevailed, though it is doubtful how far neatness is compatible with such -a place. There was no fireplace, but a great, thick, old-fashioned cook-stove occupied nearly one-fourth of the room. I -ubsequently ascertained that it was the only oven in the village, and quite a public concern, as all the baking required for the whole was done in it, and that, consequently, it was reeking with heat the greater part of the time. I presume the inhabitants of the cabin had become accustomed to the sweltering atmosphere. A man, looking very dirty and dissipated, was lying at full length on the ground, smoking a short, black, stumpy pipe. A  woman, with a bruised face, held to her bosom a little, gasping baby; while another woman, who looked younger, but whose cast of feature was excessively disagreeable, sup.

All occupations, except the smoking, stopped; and, though none welcomed, all looked at me. "Well, my friends," I said, assuming an air of careless-. ness which I certainly did not feel, "I am something of a stranger in these parts. Can you direct me to a house where I can obtain refreshment for myself and my horse?"  "Don't you want something else?" growled the man on the floor. "Wouldn't you -like to have some whisky now, or a swig of rum, in exchange for a broad piece of silver?" "No, sir," I replied. "I've no occasion for anything of the kind, though I would thank you for a drink of cold water." "Cold water!" cried the, man. "Ha 1 ha I that's too good I Cold water in hell I We live in hell, sir 1-that's what I call it. Run, some of ye, and get some water, such as it isJ. But nobody stirred. "Can you direct me to the bishop's?"I aske&amp;, at length. "And what do you want to, go there for?" he inquired. "-The bishop is no better off than the rest of us. They hadn't nothing to- eat yesterday. I don't b'lieve they have to-day." I glanced at the women. The one with the small baby  looked sad and sorrowful, while the other broke out in a coarse, disgusting laugh.,  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC8190-00000057"/> -       "         '(  THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. "Do you suppose the bishop to be at homie?"I inquired, hesitatingly. "Better look after your horse, I guess," said the man. "The bishop wants nothing of such as you." "But I want something of him," I answered. "Come, here is money, if you will tell me ;" and I drew a half-dollar from my pocket. In a moment, I saw the impropriety of this act. A telegraphic look of intelligence was suddenly exchanged all round, excepting the woman with the small baby.  The boy let go his hold of the dog. The man rose from the floor, took his pipe from his mouth, and came towards me. "The bishop is no better off than the rest," he said, ' Shouldn't wonder if some on us is better off than him. But Jim Leek, down here, I should think likely he'd keep you. At any rate, I'll go and see." "Where does he live?"I asked. "Don't worry yourself,'" said the man. "Set down here, if you can-find anything to set on. I'll find out." And he started. I was somewhat surprised at the sudden interest he manifested in my welfare' but, raising my eyesri encoun- tered those of the woman, who was looking at ne with a gaze full of meaning. A sudden, yet fearful, suspicior flashed into my mind. Yet I said no more. I felt that the only person who would willingly give me the desired infor- mation, durst not do so; and so, not knowing what else to do, I  went out; and stood by my horse. I saw the man coming; and, attracted by my appearance,   THE BISHOPBa HOUSE.       113 several others came and stood around. They were ill-look- ing fellows, and I could not but notice their significant glances. "Jim Leek says that he'll tyke you," cried the fellow, "though his accommodations ain't none of the best; and I guess you can get along somehow. Come on." I had had time for deliberation, however; and, turning suddenly around to the bystanders, said, "Will some one of you tell me where the bishop lives? I have pressing'busi- ness with him, and have been already detained too long." "He lives down there, in that house standing by itself," replied a half-idiotic fellow, who did not or would not under- stand the winks and gestures around him-' the house clear down furthest of any." "Thanks, my good fellow I  May you always find a friend in need!"I said ; and, loosening my horse, mounted, and rode in the direction he had pointed out. To tell the truth, however, I began to fear thatmy curi- osity, like that of the wives of Bluebeard, would be the means of .getting me into trouble. The sun was just sink- ing behind the western horizon. I ws both hungry and thirsty, and so was nmy faithful animal. Even if I found the bishop at home, I was not certain of a welcome recep- tion but of one thing there could be no doubt-it was a nest of thieves and cut-throats, who would not shrink from the commission of the foulest crime. The bishop's house was not a whit superior to the others, that I could discover; and I had little hope that the char-  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC8190-00000058"/> "4E      THEE-.

He returned the salutation more courteously than I expected, though- not so much so as I desired. "Have I the pleasure of addressing the bishop?"I asked. "I am that petson," he responded. "What may your business be?" "I am a stranger in this place," I replied; " and if you can accommodate me and my horse with shter and refresh- ments for the night, I " "Can't do it," he answered. "This is a poor place for i strangers. Don't see what they ever come here for." "-Different motives call them here, I presume. But, my good friend, you see I don't ask you to-give this to me, I am able and willing to pay you abundantly." His countenance brightened in a moment. "Well, weil. I will see what can be done. Our accom- modations are none of the best, but such as we have is all that we can give." "uCertainly, sir." He then pointed out a sort of hovel, where he said my horse could stand through the night. I requested food and water for her. "Yes, he would see how they were. on it for meal," and went into the house. In a few minutes he returned, with an old water-bucket, and a -tin' dish; filled with coarse meal. For water, I was directed to a spring at a little distance.. Though I found *   THE BISHOP'S THREE WIVES.      115 it without difficulty, the water was foul and muddy, and nothing but extreme thirst could have induced the mare to drink. As the grass grew plentifully around the 'spring, I permitted her to feed till dusk, then led her to the hovel, and gave her the meal. Though somewhat apprehensive of leaving her in such an .exposed situation, I could do no better. On returning to the bishop's house, he met me at the door, and invited me to enter, with apparent cordiality: "Walk in, sir; walk in; and don't be surprised at our poor appearance. Take a seat;" and he handed along the only chair to be seen in the apartment. "Thank you, sir; occupy the chair yourself. I will sit here, if you please ;" and I took possession of a low bench. There was a dim light, formed by a wick floating loosely in a saucer of melted grease, and the room was swarming with mosquitoes. Presently, two women came in, saluted me coldly, and sat down. "Couldn't you prepare this gentleman a little supper?" inquired the'bishop,' whom I now understood to be the hus- band of the two. Neither deigned an answer, and I began to consider my chances rather doubtful. Presently, another woman came in, a third and younger wife, who, being reigning sultana for the time, desired to appear amiable. Again the bishop proposed that some one should get supper for me. "What shall I getVa?" she inquired. \       &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC8190-00000059"/> "6      THE Eu  .SBND IN tUTAH. "Oh, anything that you can. I dare say the gentleman is not particular," he answered. '"Well, I will see," she said. She did see ; but found the larder empty, with the excep- tion of a little coarse meal and a few potatoes. Then the / water was gone, the fire out, and, to judge from appear- ances, I was likely to make a great deal of trouble. See- ing this, I begged them to desist, saying that I could do very well without supper. The bishop, however-who pro- bably had an eye to the pay--insisted ,that it would never do to exhibit towards a stranger such an infringement of the laws of hospitality; that he could get the water, while she made the fire; that it would take very little time, beginning being more than half. "Liz, go and borrow some fire, can't you?" said the third favorite, addressing one of the others. "No ; I shan't," retorted Liz. "You go, Sally, won't you, while I peel the potatoes," Sally shrugged hek' shoulders, but made no move to go. ': Well, I can go myself, and no thanks to you?" she con- tinued.  The two women sat like dumps, apparently sullen -or sulky. The bishop, meanwhile, went out, with a pail on ' , his arm, and his wife followed, to borrow fire, leaving me to my meditations. These, it will readily be conceived, were not of the most pleasant character; but they were sud- denly interrupted by a loud scream overhead. "There I that young un's awake," said Liz, and she * t   mounted the ladder leading to the loft. The scream was followed by others, in quick succession, anf it seemed, from four or five voices, go multitudinous and I/ud was the din. "Darn the young uns, I say!" out red Sally,. likewise ascending. the ladder.  The music overhead seemed momentarily to increase, between the harsh scolding of the women and the cries of the children, varied, by way of chorus, with an occasional noise of blows. In the midst, the fire-borrower-whom I shall henceforth denominate my hostess-returned, carrying a small handful of coals between some hollow pieces of bark. "You fcon't have matches here," I remarked, wishing to appear sociable. "Matches!" she reiterated, with an accent of some str- prise-"Matches I - should think there was enough of them!"  "Then why don't you use them? They are very handy.'J As What do you mean?" she said. "Ithought you was talking about matches-getting married." This ludicrous misunderstanding completely upset  my gravity, and we laughed together, thus becoming acquaint- ances and very good friends. /It is astonishing how a joke will unbend the most austere ; how it inspires patience and creates intimacies; how, from laughing with a stranger, you get to talking to him.' It is ever so with me. ". The tempest overhead has subsided," I remarked. "What?" she queried.

"I have become so used to such sounds that I don't mind them at all. Neither does pa." No fire yet!" said the bishop, entering the house, and setting down the pail of water, with a loud grunt. "And little prospect of any," she echoed. Indeed, it was becoming doubtful whether the few bor- rowed coals, instead of kindling a flame, would not become totally extinguished. "Here, pa ; you set down and whittle up some shavings, can't you?" she said. "Be sure, I can. I declare, these hot nights are enough to kill the devil!" he continued. I thought so, too, and finally left the house to procure a breath of fresh air. Outside, my ears were greeted with a concert, though not of sweet sounds. Two or three dogs were barking, probably for their own. amusement, while shouts and oaths of drunken, profanity came from a cabin where several men had assembled to hold a debauch. The night was sultry--not a breath of air stirring-and I re- -turned into the house. The bishop had sunk down on a bench, and was violently fanning himself with a handkerchief. His wife was squat- ting before the fire-place, quite as violently blowing the fire with her apron, of which the corners were wrapped around her hands ; and the motion up and'down puffed out great gusts .of smoke and embers, completely enveloping her and filling the room.-  "Sit down," said the bishop. "We've got a beginning, %    ' GETTING SUPPER.         119 you see, and beginning's half. - There's never smoke without fire." He was disposed to be facetious. "I exceedingly regret putting your family to so much trouble," I said..  "Never mind that-money'll make it all square." If he could feel so, I was satisfied. At length the- smoke cleared away, and its place was sup- plied by a bright, clear flame. An iron pot-which did triple service, as tea-kettle, boiler, and stew-pan-was brought out from its seclusion in the corner, filled with water, and set over the flame. Then, while the Rev. Mor- mon peeled-a handful of potatoes with his jack-knife; my hostess mixed a corn-cake, after the most approved back- woods fashion. The dough.-simple meal and water, with a little salt-she flattened, with her,hand, on a long, narrow, but smooth board, and placed, it on one edge before the fire. In this reflection of glowing heat, the cake soon acquired the requisite tint of brownness, when it was nicely turned, and the other side exposed to the same ordeal. Meanwhile, the potatoes were being boiled ; and an hour before midnight my supper was pronounced ready. Though. got up with extraordinary effort, it was not a very extra- ordinary affair. Tea or coffee was not to be thought of in' such a connection. Meat was a proscribed delicacy. Sweet- cakes: and sweetmeats were Aut of the question; but a sharp- - ened appetite gave a zest to the most. ordinary food, and I made a hearty, though frugal meal.   .    .   &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8190-00000061"/> 120      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. During the repast, I attempted to open a conversation with-the bishop ab out the prospects of the Mormon Church, and its connections in Europe. He was not inclined to give me the information I desired, but I fancied that he seemed dissatisfied. I learned, however, jthat he was a man of small property in England, frugal, contented, and happy in the affections of a small and virtuous family. But the ser- pent crept into his Eden-the tempter came. He whispered of wealth, honor, and distinction in the new churc The  , dormant passions of his nature were aroused. Thoughts and feeliags in his heart that had always slept, came into strange and tumultuous exercise. He no longer relished the simple pleasures of his home. He shrunk from toil, and despised the honest and honorable occupations of his ancestors. The glowing accounts of the New World, with its Land of Promise, whose beauty of climate and fertility of. soil was described as unequalled, induced him to emigrate. He sold his property, placed the proceeds in the general church-fund, and, with others of his countrymen, took pas-  sage in a ship for New-York, under the superintendence of a Mormon priest. After many difficulties, they reached Ziori, in a state of want, discomfort, and disorganization absolutely :indescribable. Their national spirit, however, kept them together.' They hated the Yankees, and the Yankees despised them. Brigham took the matter in hand, but could not reconcile the jarring factions. Finally, he advocated their removal and settlement in a separate col- ony-thus forming a distinct branch of his church, with a   THE BISHOP ON POLYGAMY.,       121 bishop, chosen from their number, to superintend their spir- itual affairs.' They consented to this, and my entertainer was the one selected. Yet his promotion was merely nomi- nal, and barren alike of wealth or honor.  He informed me that the Mormons were quite numerous in England, and had their chapels and places for public worship in many parts of London. "Do they practise, polygamy there?"I inqurec. "No ; the laws will not allow it," he answered. "And do you really and truly consider it an advantage?" I asked. He shook his head. "Are the' Mormons in England aware of the practice here?" "They were not, till recently," he replied. "I under- stand that it proves a great stumbling-block in foreign' countries, and thiat many who would otherwise join us hesi- tate about doing so on that account."  Having finished my supper, the bishop pointed to a sort of cot in one corner of the apartment, where he said I could sleep; and then, after making some remarks on the latenesS of the hour, and several excuses for the paucity of my accommodations, he ascended to the loft, followed by his wife, who bade me "good-night " as she disappeared. Without disrobing, I threw myself on the cot, and attempted to-sleep, but in vain. The heated atmosphere grew closer and more stifling every moment. I was assailed on all sides by buzzing, stinging insects, and yet more naun- f      n  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC8190-00000062"/> 122      THE XH SsBAN D vI UTAH. seous vermin. It was near morning when I sunk into an uneasy slumber, from which the advent of half a dozen / children aroused me in the morning. They were little, dirty, elfish-looking beings, only half clad, in -old, faded garments. The females soon followed, and, last of all, came the bishop himself. Not wishing for a repetition of the scenes of the previous evening, I made immediate prepara- tions to depart, and inquired of my host what I should pay him for all the trouble that I had occasioned. Of course, I expected a pretty good charge, but was hardly prepared for the unreasonable demand of five dollars. However, I paid it without grumbling, and was rather amused at- his appa- rent pleasure when I bade them " good-morning." I started direct for 'the outhouse where I had left my filly, with some apprehensions that she might have been stolen. Fortunately, in that respect, at least, I had miscon- ceived their characters. She was there, and recognized my ^ approach with a low neigh. I adjusted the bridle and sad- dle to her head and back, and, leading her forth, was met by the man with whom. I had conversed the previous eve- ning. He was evidently recovering from a debauch of the preceding night.        - :' Going now?" he said, with a satanic leer. "I am. Have you any objections?"I replied, with more complaisance than, under other circumstances, I might have manifested at so unceremonious an intrusion. /  "Well, you can't go ; not yet," he said, taking the horse by the head. "I've a bill to settle with you."   *A LUOCK  ESCAPE.       123 This was said with a voice, gesture, and manner that I find utterly impossible to describe. "What'kind of a bill?"I repeated, wishing to humor the fellow, though strongly inclined to knock him down. "Let go of my horse, will you?"I continued-" and tell me what I can do for you;" and I vaulted on her back. "No; I shan't let go the horse," he replied ; and now he was joined by three others, quite as ugly anddepraved as -himself. I really felt alarmed, and began to consider the best way of escaping their clutches. "You're a 'formant!" said one. "A spy 1" chimed another. ' I knowed that last night i" cried a third, pleased with the idea of his superior penetration. A lucky thought occurred, to me. Taking a handful of loose change and coppers from my pocket, I scattered them on the ground. The man let go his hold of the, horse on the instant. His companions scrambled for a share, while I quietly rode off without further opposition. I subsequently ascertained that they practised a regular system of sponging on travellers, and that one was fortu- nate to escape as easily as I did. I stopped several times on my homeward route, to allow the horse to feed; and, having accidentally lost my game of the previous day, shot three more ducks. It was-near night'when I reached the residence of brother Wells. He was pleased to see me, probably because I brought his horse safely back. I  was foolish enough to think that pos-  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8190-00000063"/> 124j     THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. sibly he might invite me to take supper with him, though I much doubted the capability of his household to prepare anything eatable. Whether on this account, or because he was conscientiously opposed. to wasting hospitality on a Gentile, he breathed no. murmur of invitation ; and I plod- ded back to Zion, actually more hungry than I had ever been before. A-         9i s    BSTPERIORITY OF THE FIR6T WIFE.     125 CHAPTER VII. THE MRS. UNDERWOOD^S JEALOUSIES, MSUNDERSTANDINGS, AND REMOVAL. TN most Mormon families where polygamy is practised, I believe the superiority of the first wife to be involunta- rily acknowledged. Certain it is, that the others are jealous of her, and act as spies on her conduct. If they can find, or invent with the least plausibility, any cause of reproach against her, they are only too happy to communicate the same to their lord. Thus, family difficulties are occasioned, and actions really innocent in themselves become, through jealousy and misrepresentation, the cause of great domestic trouble. I had been admitted, as a boarder, to brother Under- wood's house, yet a former acquaintance with his wife had certainly given me a right to be treated with greater consid- eration than a mere stranger. I had sought and obtained as many opportunities of conversing with Maria, thoughtless that my attentions could be construed to mean more than mere friendly regard, or that the easy and amiable Under-  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8190-00000064"/> 126       THE HUSBAND I JTAH. wood could be induced to cherish a jealous feeling. I had noticed for some time an increased coolness on his part towards me, and had half suspected that a system  of espionageion my conversation and conduct was being prac- tised. Latterly, when conversing with Maria, a flitting shadow, the sudden fall of something, or the echo of a retreating footstep, would indicate the presence of a third person, till I really began to think that the wives of brother Under- wood possessed a remarkable sort of ubiquity. They were ever hovering near you. If you sat in the dining-room, the doors would be left open, and your eyes delighted by the continual passing and repassing of petticoats. If you as- cended the stairs, keen black eyes watched your progress. Where you least expected their appearance, they would Abe, sometimes with a meaning-smile on their countenances-at others, with a leer- but always with an expression that seemed to me extremely disagreeable. I am not naturally suspicious, and for a long time considered these little cir- cumstances as accidental, of'course, and though excessively annoying, not sufficiently so to warrant my removal from the house. Recently, however, I began to suspect that more was meant than met the eye, and determined to be as guarded and circumspect in my deportment as possible. On the-day of my return from Brickville, I went at once to my boarding-house. It was near dusk ; and two drunken Indians, and one or two soldiers, were in the bar-room, with Underwood behind the Counter. 'He took no notice of my ,. .    Bdl.

"Who is housekeeper for to-day?"I inquired. Mrs. Maria," answered one of them, laying a peculiar emphasis on the "Mrs." , And where is she?" They all' giggled but returned no answer. Not seeing anything so very ludicrous in my question, I inquired what they were all laughing at. This redoubled their mirth, when, flinging the ducks at the feet of one, I hastily retreated towards my room. It was now duskish, and I encountered Maria on the land- ing-place. She carried a small candle, and had evidently been weeping. Instantly recognizing me, she said, "So you have returned; but you must go away again." "Where to?" I demanded. "Anywhere. You must seek another home." "Seek another home I Why, pray?" B , "Eer se--because- oh, we have had such another time during your absence I My husband was so angry I In short, he is jealous of you."

I dare say that this moment there are listeners to our conversation. You must go hence immediately, and return no more." I( ..

"Together again!" said one whom I knew to be Under- wood. I looked around. He was standing at the bottom of the staircase, two or three women peering over his shoulders, on tip-toe, and the bar-room group- leering and staring behind them. Maria retreated hastily. I stood still, facing the group; for I thought some explanation due myself and her. Addressing Underwood, I requested to know the meaning of" such strange conduct. "You know very well what it means," he replied. "Wasn't you talking just now to Maria, and she to you? Tell me that l' "We certainly were conversing." "What about?" asked one of the soldiers. "Jealous husbands, and wives who act the part of spies," I replied, and passed on to my room. The agitation of my feelings almost precluded the idea of hunger. Then Nature asserted her rights over sentiment. I descended the stairs, went direct to the larder, and helped myself. Whether any one se w me or not, I neither knew nor cared. My first business next morning was to procure new lodg- ings, and I determined, rather presumptuously, not to go where there was more than one wife. My inquiries -must- have seemed ridiculous enough. In the Eastern cities, the number of children often determines the bargain in such cases, but with me it was rather the number of wives.   "OOKING FOR BOARD.        129   "Do you know of any place where I could obtain board for a month or so?"I said to an old Mormon with whom I had become slightly acquainted. "Well, I don't know," he replied. "There's brother Solomon-a' very good man-takes in boarders sometimes. Don't know whether or not he wants any now." "How many wives?"I inquired.  "Only ten." "Won't do for me." "Why not?-the more the merrier I One is a good singer. 'Another plays the harp beautifully. I should think you would be agreeably entertained." I shook my head. He smiled. "Is there a man n this city with only one wife?" "There may be, though I know of none." "Not one?" "No. Stay--yes; there is Elder Hyde. I recollect hearing that he had but one." "And do you suppose that he could be induced to take me ink?" "Doubtful. His wife, they say, won't suffer any addition to the family. She fears it might lead to the consequences she most dreads." "I shall make the trial." "You can do so, but I think it will be useless." I made the .trial-it was useless. "*  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC8190-00000066"/> 130    THE ITUSBAND IN UTA. MRS. HYDE. I found Mrs. Hyde, and her family, in a small, yet con. venient, adobe house, situated at the east er side of the city, in a very public place. I say " her family ;" for she certainly seemed the ruling, reigning spirt, monopolizing the conversation, and manifesting her independence in a thousamd little ways. I was quite charmed with her naive simplicity, though I saw that it augured adverse to my scheme.  Addressing the elder, I inquired, "If he could find it convenient to take a boarder." Ask her," he replied. "I have nothing to say about it.' "We have had several applicationsfor board lately,' she interposed,.with remarkable vivacity. , Excuse me, sir but are you a stranger!"i She said this flitting around the house like a humming- bird, very busy in preparing dinner. "Not exactly a stranger, madam. I have been in this place about two months." "Where have you been living!" she continued, with true feminine curiosity "At Underwood's." "Indeed!  And why don't you stay there?"       ] She was determined to have the whoIe story, while I felt such questions to be decidedly impertinent. -P  nent,  '"-*        *   MRS. HEYD.   ,      131 "Excuse my freedom, madam, but I scarcely think that subject pertinent to our present business," I answered. Her face flushed for a) moment, then her black eyes twinkled, and she finally burst into a laugh. "That's right!" said the elder, with mirth depicted on his countenance. "The curiosity of women is" "Now, hiish!" said the little, vivacious wife, clapping her delicate hand over his mouth. The husband laughed and struggled. "There was no harm in her asking," I said. "And there was no harm in your refusing to tell," she answered. "I understand your feelings ; the rebuff was merited. Yet, in a place like this, where there is such a constant influx of strangers, it is necessary to know some- thing of one's character, especially if he proposes to become an inmate of orie's family." This was said with such a charming air, and so depre- cating a manner, that I felt half ashamed of myself, and wondered that I had attributed to mere feminine curiosity what had evidently arisen from a better and nobler feeling. Mrs. Hyde, assisted by her husband, set out the dinner- table. Then she laid the cloth, and selected the dishes necessary to the repast, but found, in the meantime, abun- dant opportunity to talk. "I made up my mind some time ago, that nothing should -induce me to receive any additions to my family ;" and;she -glanced at her husband. " I do my own housework, and I find it quite sufficient to keep me busy." -  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC8190-00000067"/> 1i82     THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. "I have, told her, sometimes, that we had much better take in two or three boarders, and keep a hired- girl. I think we. could make it profitable," said the husband. "No hired girl comes on the premises while I stay 1" she answered quickly, her black eyes fairly snapping. "I de- test the whole tribe!" "That is a strong expression," said the husband. "It's a true one, however," she replied. "Come, dinner is ready." I was invited to partake, and not having received a defi- nite answer to my, proposal, was not prepared to depart, and in consequence accepted it. The food was excellently dished, and served with taste. There was no disorder nor disarrangement. Everything looked well, and ate well; for all was suitable and in place. The elder was complaisant, the lady social, and I thought she took great painis to inter- est and amuse him, though immovable in her determination on certain points. When the dinner was finished, and we had risen from the table, she again addressed me: "Now, sir, not to keep you longer in suspense, I must firmly, yet respectfully, decline to receive you." The husband looked towards her as if he wished that she had decided otherwise. ,' I have one question to ask, however, which I really hope you will' not consider impertinent. I -wish to know what induced you to make application here for a home. It   SA SENrRT F Wpan.       133 is a perfect mystery to me why so many seem disposed to abide with us." I could not help smiling at her earnestness, but doubted the expediency of making the communication she desired. "You hesitate," she began. "Shall I guess?" "Certainly." "And you will tell me then?" "Be sure, I will." "Is it because my husband has but one wife?" "It is. At least, that was the inducement with me." "I thought so." And she looked archly towards her. husband. He sat apparently in meditative mood. "Have you seen much of polygamy?" she questioned. "I could not be in this country without seeing enough of it," I replied. "In my opinion," she said, "it is the most abominable practice ever introduced into the world. If I had a daugh- ter, I would much rather -see her shrouded for a coffin, than married to a Mormon." "But a Mormon might be a just alnf upright man." "Might be," she repeated. "Yes, might be, as my hus- band is ; but you have no security in law, Christianity, or public opinion. If my husband goes out, I cannot help thinking that possibly he may return with another wife. If a single lady comes to visit me, how can I be sure that she has no designs on him? And the worst of all is, I am under the necessity of concealing my feelings."  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC8190-00000068"/> 134      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. "That must be a vexation to one so free-spoken as your. self," retorted the husband. "I have no fears that this gentleman will ever take the trouble to report my conversation," she said. "I hope, sir, that you will not," said the elder, addressing me. "It is all unfounded prejudice on her part. Many families live happily, I believe, where there are two or even more wives."                    - "I replied that, after my hospitable reception and enter- tainment in their family, it would be the height of ingrati- tude in me to-report anything that might tend to their dis- advantage; and soon after took leave, really pleased with my visit.

He evidently considered it beneath his dignity to pay much attention to his guests--sometimes rudely turning his back when inquiries were made olfhim, and scarcely ever heeding complaints or requests. His wives were far his superiors in manners, but as they were expected to do all the work, and perform the duties of attendance on the boarders besides, it is not surprising that many things were disregarded that should have been attended to, and that it seemed the study of each to shirk the labors and responsibilities herself, by laying them thick and heavy on the shoulders of her companion. Thus; if the towels were not changed, or the chamber service duly performed, Martha accused Hannah of the remissness, or Hannah declared that all the blame was chargeable to Martha. But I was chiefly amused, though many times half vexed, at Inkley's manner of praising himself and the arrangements of his household. It was the only subject over which he ever grew eloquent; "What an excellent supper you have got, Martha I I declare, you beat all women for getting up good things, with little effort, though I cannot say without cost. Wish I could; it would be better for all concerned," he began, drawing his chair unceremoniously to the table, and inviting me to follow.  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC8190-00000069"/> 136     I THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. "We have little variety here," he continued. "Though I never fancied variety in- food-a few dishes, and good ones, I say. Martha understands that 1" At this juncture, Hannah flung out of the room in high O dudgeon, while Martha smiled complacently, and I looked in vain to discover some particular, excellence in the dishes before me. They consisted of cold salt-meat, dry slices of bread, stale butter, and some kind of wild fruit, stewed in water, without spice or sugar. The weakest nerves could not have been deranged by the tea, wlich was served with blue milk only, while cakes and preserves seemed unknown or forbidden delicacies. "Now, do help yourself," said Inkley, setting the exam- ple. "Make yourself -at home, as Aaron used to say. Don't you remember, Martha, when we went to Aaron's, that time, with your sister's family, and you, being afraid that Susy wouldn't like so many of us coming at once, took along an old dress, to work in, and assist her about getting dinner ;. and how pleased Aaron seemed, and how he tickled you by continually saying, 'Now, Matty, make yourself at home?'" "Oh, yes;. I remember it all," said Martha; "but it was hardly necessary to repeat it here." "Help yourself to the butter. Excellent butter we have in Deseret-far superior to that in the States," he continued, affecting to eat eagerly, though in-reality devouring little.

"We have a very nice chamber in readiness for you, sir," he said, soon after tea. "My dear," addressing Martha, "that bed has been properly aired, has it not? I know you always have things very nice and comfortable, but thought no harm could come of mentioning it." Martha replied that -if he wished to know about that, he must go to Hannah. "Well, I presume it's all right. We will go, if you please."           I followed him up stairs, to a small room, in one corner of the house, next under the roof. To judge from appear- ances, not a soul had entered it that day. The door was closed, the windows had been shut, and the air was as hot and stifling as that of an oven. "A very niceschamber, this," said Inkley; "convenient and comfortable." "Uncomfortable, you might have said," I suggested. "The heat is intolerable ; the room has not been sufficiently ventilated," and I threw, up a window. "Strange!" said Inkley. "This room has always been a favorite with every one. I had some thoughts of occupy- ing it myself, but the boarders always liked it so well, that I hesitated to deprive them of it. Hope you are not more difficult to suit than the others hive been.

I slept, as usual, with the windows open, and awoke in the morning, refreshed and    :X invigorated. Various domestie sounds saluted my ears.   fi- The husband talking, one woman scolding, another laugh-    ing, with the racing, shouting, and crying of children, quite counterbalanced my natural tendency to a morning reverie in bed. I rose hastily, but no conveniences for a gentle-  ; man's toilet were at hand-neither water-pitcher, stand, napkin, or mirror. There was no bell; but had there been, who would have answered it? Fortunately, I had acquired a habit of taking things as they came, and- had been too -  long accustomed to a camp-life, to be discomposed by trivial circumstances. Taking care that my apartment should have a good airing, at least, for that day, I removed the sheets, shook up the bed, and extended the windows to their utmost capacity. While making these arrangements, I heard Inkley's voice calling- from the foot of the stairs, "Breakfast is ready, sir." I descended, to find that breakfast was not ready, but only in a state of preparation. The kitchen was divided from the sitting-room by a thin partition; and it was impos- sible, while remaining in the one, to be ignorant of what was going on in the other. The women were quarrelling, land applying to each other the coarsest and most brutal epi- thets; and the husband, by attempts to reconcile them, e only made matters worse. Growing vexed and wearied at  this, he seized the broom, and threatened to strike the first one that opened her mouth to speak again. "And get   GATHERING HONEY-DEW.        139 breakfast ready in double-quick time. Don't you know that the gentleman is waiting-?" "Let him, wait, thenf muttered one of them. By the time that b eakfast was ready, however, Hannah had become good-natured, though Martha refused to appear at the table. The master, as usual, extolled the fare, and pronounced the lady beside him the most accomplished housekeeper in the world. During this time, the children were scrambling for the choice of pieces, and drawing the saucer of berries from one to the other, alternately, across the table. "Good children, they are," said the father, " though full of spirits, and a little boisterous sometimes. But we were all children once, I suppose, and probably no better than those we see around us now. People-don't realize this as they should, or they would exhibit more patience with the little ones."      , Having finished my breakfast, I went out to breathe the fresh air; and, walking to the banks of a small stream, encountered a party gathering honey-dew from the leaves' of the cottonwood trees growing along its banks. They were in high spirits, and the valley rang with their shouts, songs, and hilarious laughter. There were old and young- men, maidens, and boys--some with spoons and saucers, and others without-but all, it seemed to me, more intent on enjoyment than on obtaining the honeyed secretion, whith stood in great saccharine globules on the leaves.

'I did not mingle with the group, but seated myself on the trunk of a fallen tree, within sight and hearing, where I was presently joined by one of the party.

As I have told you, my mother is dead. Love and gratitude to the authors of my being, first brought me here, and the same feelings now detain me." Meanwhile, the gatherers of the honey-dew had obtained all the sweets to be found there, and departed to look else- where.. We were not sorry to be alone. He told me of their beautiful home in New York, and how happy they- were in the society of friends and neighbors, till the tempter came.       , "My father," he continued; " was simple in his ways and habits, 4insophisticated- and ignorant of the world as a child.

It breathed her usual tenderness, but I detected in it a change from the usual placid serenity. I felt, in a moment, that something had occurred to agitate or wound her feelings, though of its nature I had not the most distant idea. That day, in look- ing over the newspaper published in my native village, I saw an announcement that the Mormons were- to preach in the schoolhouse, at an appointed time, with a preliminary view of the rise and peculiarities -of the hnew faith. Yet I never dreamed that my honored parents could be seduced from allegiance to the church they had loved and honored from childhood. 'I had too much confidence in their stabil- ity of principle and abiding good-sense, and only thought of them as wonderiftg at the defection and apostasy of 4hers.

"And you went home?" "I went home, after asking leave of absence, which was reluctantly given. The stage stopped near my father's door. I alighted, ran to the house, and entered the parlor, without announcement. It was dusk, and the apartment was lighted by a lamp. I was surprised to see so much companyaround, and all were too busy to notice my abrupt, yet noiseless, entrance. My mother was seated near the table, on which lay apile of papers ; and a lawyer-bending over her chair, and pointing with his finger to recent inkmarks on one of them-was repeating, ' You acknowledge this to'-- "I comprehended the scene in an instant: ' Stop, mother I For Heaven's sake, stop I' She lifted her eyes, sprung towards me, and fell, fainting, into my arms."

We had sat a short half-hour together, when a coarse, red-faced woman, with a flannel night-cap on her head, came in, and seemed perfectly at home. When she went out, I inquired, 'Does that woman live with you?  "' Yes.' "' In what capacity?' "Her lips quivered, her whole. frame trembled, and her eyes filled with tears.

With tears streaming down her face, and her voice broken by sobs, she went on to narrate how this ugly,.greasy specimen of womarinhood had been formerly attached to the harem of a priest, where she kept the whole house in an uproar. He determined to get rid of her, and so persuaded my kind- hearted parent that it was his duty to take her. The old man hesitated, and asbed time for deliberation.

"I have brought you a visitor, father," said Frederick. The old man raised his head, and returned my salutation with affability. He had mild, brown eyes, with such an easy, guileless expression of countenance, that I doubted not his complete subjection to the designs of the impostors. Strange as it may appear, his faith in Mormonism was not in the least shaken; and when I commenced conversing with him, he answered by exhorting me to come out from the world and unite with the saints. I inquired if his happiness had been promoted by his union with them, to which he replied that, whether or not, such questions were irrelevant to the subject; that they were not expecting happiness here, and must be contented to cheerfully bear minor trials, in consideration of the glori- ous consummation in prospect. The simple creature then proceeded to relate the marvels and miracles that had been wrought in favor of the Mor- mons. According to him, their journey was attended with events almost as wonderful and supernatural as that of the Israelites when they went up out of Egypt.

Why shouldn't miracles be common now, as they were then? Why shouldn't they, sure I Others than himself have asked that question. When I bade the old man farewell, Frederick accompa- nied me a short distance towards my boarding-house. "You see my father, what he is--a mere child. I can- not leave him to the tender mercies of these creatures. Duty, honor, filial affection, forbid it. He is weak and imbecile. Still he is my father;, and not till his earthly pilgrimage closes, shall I leave the Mormon city."

THE DINNER---A NEW WIFE-JAUNT TO GRANTSVILLE, AND WHAT I SAW THERE, ETC. THE dinner was got up with unusual taste, and a new divinity presided at the table. She was a little, neat woman, with brown complexion, and black eyes. Her mo- tions were quick and graceful; and, flitting from thing to thing, she strongly reminded me of Mrs. Hyde. Inkley was highly pleased, and exceedingly loquacious. He laughed pinched the lady's cheek, and jogged my elbow in a man- ner quite unaccountable. Hannah and Martha were invisi- ble, but their lord did not seem to perceive, much less to regret their absence. The children, too, had disappeared, and were, probably, at that moment dining .with their mam-  mas, in another apartment. I subsequently learned the history of this woman. It was somewhat singular. Her maiden name was Sarah Car- ter, and she had rich and highly respectable connexions in the State of Rhode Island. Sarah, when a child, was chiefly noted for versatility-of talent and changeableness of   &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8190-00000077"/> 152      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. purpose. In her studies, before one science was half mas- tered, she flew off to another. She abandoned French for music, music for crayon-drawing, and drawing for sculpture. She gave up school-teaching and became a public lecturer on woman's rights. Wearying of this, she became a clair- voyant, then a spirit-rapper, and finally fetched up on the shoals of Mormonism. That she was witty and graceful, no one could deny, and many would have admired her style of beauty. A Mormon elder certainly did. He saw her on the ferry-boat that plies between Jersey City and the island of Manhattan, was struck with her appearance, and inquired her name. Learning this, he presented himself, without the ceremony of an introduction, was graciously received, and soon became one of her most devoted admirers, though six or seven wives pined for his embraces at home. The lover was ardent in his protestations, liberal in gifts, and the con- sequences of their intimacy soon became visible. At this juncture, he persuaded her to follow him to Salt Lake. Change was her element, and she consented; but immedi- ately on their arrival, he abandoned her. Among strangers, and without resources, she became a pensioner on the bounty of Parley Pratt. Here Inkley saw her, was made acquainted with her circumstances, proposed for her hand, was accepted, and the marriage celebrated-all in one day. The next morning-the day on which I    saw her-he brought her home, which was the first intimation that his other wives had received of the affair. They were surprised, but not angry, and at once abandoned all the house-keeping arrange-   - DINM TALK.        153 ments to her hands. She accepted the charge with a very good grace, and doubtless with the expectation of resigning it in her turn to another. She addressed me across the table, with great good-humor, saying that she was curious to know why I came to Salt Lake City. Without waiting for my answer, Inkley replied: "The same that others come for, probably-to see and be seen. Wasn't that so, sir?" "Doubtless that had something to do with my motives," I replied. The lady then launched into a Voluble strain--talked of Mesmerism, spirit-rapping, and woman's rights-said that Lucy Stone was the greatest woman of the age, that Mrs. Bloomer deserved a monument, and Antoinette Brown a wreath of laurel. "And yet all these women are in pursuit of an idea rather than a principle," I said. "They cannot succeed, 4  because they oppose nature.". "How oppose nature?" she inquired. "Because man and woman never advance side by side. He leads the way-she follows. He acts the tyrant-she becomes the slave. He affects the noble and godlike-she rises proportionately. Never has woman opened a path in literature, art, or scien6e." Inkley laughed heartily, and the bride looked vexed. "If anything-were wanting," I continued, "' to prove how completely woman is, subjected by nature to the caprices ox man, we have a practical exemplification   of it directly  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC8190-00000078"/> 154      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. before our eyes. How readily she assumes the character he destines for her I How" "I do not understand you," she said, interrupting me. "I dq," said Inkley. "I have often thought of the same. Many think polygamy degrading to women; that is unde- niable. I can't say that I do, however. But whether it is or not, matters Lttle. One thing is certain-they are impo- tent to resist it. -Man wills it, and, whether she wishes it or not, woman submits." Dinner being over, Mr. Inkley informed me that business connected with the Church would call him to Grantsville, and that he expected to be absent for several days. I im- mediately asked permission to accompany him, and inquired for the locality of that settlement. "About forty miles west," he replied, and went on to impart considerable information connected with the place 'and its inhabitants, which tended to increase rather than diminish my curiosity and spirit of adventure. The afternoon was spent in preparations for the projected journey. We had a cold supper, and retired early, pur- posing to start at daybreak. In the night, I was awakened by a loud clap of thunder, and sensations similar to those experienced in a shower-bath. It was raining violently; and the roof being leaky, and the window-casements loose, the water dripped and drove in from every quarter, wetting the bed, and standing in large pools on the floor. The night was black as pitch, except the occasional gleams of lightning, followed instantaneously by the crack of thunder,   A 'rElTBLE STORM. loud and terrific as if heaven and earth were coming together. In a pause of the storm, I ascertained that the inmates of the house were all up and in motion. Once C there was a loud crash,- and fall, as of a heavy body tum- bling down stairs ; then the suppressed screams of women and children, and a man's voice, in a softer-key, caught my ear. I arose, but my garments were saturated with wet. Those protected by the cover of my trunk, however, were in a better condition. After long searching in the dark, I found and put them on. Simultaneous with this, the house was illumined by a blinding flash, of which I took advan- tage, to rush out of my room and down the stairs. The family were all in the kitchen; and a small lamp, burning on the hearth, sufficed to give a view of each blank and terror-stricken countenance. The children were weeping, the women sobbing, and all, except Sarah, huddled together, like a group of frightened sheep. She was walking up and down the apartment, wringing her hands, and making ges- tures of -the wildest despair, while exclaiming, "Oh, poor sinners I What will become of- poor sinners I The day of judgment, has come 1-the great day of judgment I Oh, oh 1" Seeing me, she cried out, "Are you ready to stand before the bar of the great God?" "Compose yourself, madam," I replied. "There is no occasion for all this terror. And were it as you say, though vice has always- cause for fear, virtue should stand unblenched amid the ruins of the world." "Poor sinners 1- Oh, poor sinners!" she continued, shriek- r  *     .  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC8190-00000079"/> 156       THE HUTSBAND IN UTAH. ing-thus forcibly depicting the horrors of superstition, auk illustrating the fact that, whatever may be the boasted knowledge of the age, weak minds will be terrified at the phenomena of nature. Presently, the flashes came no more, and -the thunder rolled in the distance. Then the clouds parted--one great body rolling off to the eastward, while the other settled into the south.  The moon, just sinking in thewestern horizon, came out in its mild, pale beauty, and a few stars, seen here and there, glanced out, like the eyes of angels. Inkley remarked on the suddenness and violence of the storm, and Sarah, now that it was,past, laughed at her unreasonable fears. Then all retired again to their respective chambers; except myself.' I was not partial to a wet-sheet pack, just then, but stretched my limbs on a buffalo-robe, and soon fell asleep. It was that most delicious of hours, between dawn and sunrise, when I  awoke. Hastily rising, I went out. The air was fresh, delicious, and invigorating; but everywhere were to be seen traces of the last night's tempest. Trees and shrubs had been torn to pieces or overblown, fences levelled, and fields of grain bent to the ground. In all the hollows, pools of water were gathered, while the streams rushed wild and turgid down the declivities. Hearing a voice behind me, I turned, to meet the countenance of Ink- ley. He, too, had risen, and come out to ascertain the state of the weather. Considering this favorable, the women were called up, and immediate preparations for breakfast made.    JUNT TO GRA'TSVVLLE.       157 This being over, and our small amount of baggage ready, we mounted a wagon with two wheels, exactly resembling a cart, except that it was covered with a coarse white cloth, drawn tightly over bows, benit in a half circle, and fastened, by the ends, to the wagon sides. Elder Lyman had talked of going along--more for company, I believe, than anything else. We called first at his house, and were answered, from the door, by a woman with a blowzy face, flaring from a red nightcap, that the elder could not travel in the com- pany of Gentiles. "Is that all?" inquired Inkley. She said that it was. ' Where is he?V" "In the house." "Can I see him?" She hesitated a moment, when, finally, it came out that the worthy was taking his morning snooze. "Let him go, and be d-d 1" said my companion, in a low voice, starting the mules into a gallop. For two or three miles, we moved on rapidly, over a tolerably good road ; then the ground became soft, spongy, and, in many places, decidedly muddy. Sometimes a deep gully would intercept our progress, .and sometimes we would have to circumnavigate a -fallen tree. The jolting was severe and incessant,' yet, as if to make up for this, the whole scenery was perfectly delightful. The day was fine- not a cloud to be seen-and the mountains flashed their summits in the rich sunlight. We-passed around the elbow  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8190-00000080"/> 158       THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. of the mountain range, on the lower steppe of which the city is built, and went directly north-first by the warm springs, which furnish to visitors the luxury of a bath, and then by the hot springs, of which the ascending vapor is such a remarkable addition to the scenery. After a time, the road diverged to the left, and- some very pretty farm-houses, surrounded by fields of grain, appeared in view. Mr. Inkley stopped at one of these, leaving me in the wagon, to hold the mules, with the posi- tive assurance that he would be back in five minutes, though his stay was prolonged to an hour. He returned to the wagon, evidently pleased with the success of his visit. "Very nice place; sir," he began.. "Nice people, too, sir-very nice; though sister Laton appeared rather down- cast. Shedfinds it hard to conform  to the rules-of. our faith-very hard, sir. But, as I told her, 'no cross, no crown.?' Mr. Inkley interlarded'his conversation withl expletives, at certain times ;- at others he did not. "What is it that she finds so hard?"I questioned, excusing myself, mentally, for such a breach of etiquette, by remembering that Inkley loved to tell news quite as well as any one could delight to hear it. "The fact is, sir, that brother Laton has been seriously exercised about taking another wife. He kows very well that it is his duty, but hitherto, from respect to the preju- dices of his first wife, has neglected it. 'Tbe case went before the church, and the council of elders decided that, to   FF -M'ATE '"HELP" DANGEROUS.    159  ensure his salvation and that of his family, he must conform in all things to the requirements of our faith." "And Mrs.. Laton" "Fainted away. when informed of that decision." "Who is the candidate for promotion?" "The hired girl, I believe," he answered, with all the coolness imaginable. "Brother Laton was much affected by the distress of his wife, and it required all the arguments I could bring, backed by the influence of the church, to strengthen his resolution." "What did the girl say?" "Oh, nothing. Mrs. Laton was an Eastern woman, and very proud. I suppose it cuts close to have a servant ele- vated to an equality with herself. But the proud shall be brought low, and the humble exalted-such is the language of Scripture." "When is Laton to marry his second wife?" "Next week.  Her bridal robes have been ready for some time." "It must be dangerous, in Utah, to have a hired girl 1" -"Rather l" he replied, laughing, and the subject was dropped, For the remainder of the day, we journeyed over a good road, along the lake-the ascending vapor of the hot-spring hanging like a thin veil of gauze at the base of the moun- tains, and the City dimly visible in the rear. This, however, entirely faded from view as-we descended into the valley of the Weber, and paused to rest, in one of the loveliest spots  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8190-00000081"/> 160      THE ausuAND IN UTrH. imaginable. Here the mules were unharnessed, and left to feed on the rich grass, while we sat beneath the cooling shade of some very handsome trees, or strolled, in search of wild flowers and odd-looking pebbles, along the margin of the stream. The banks were exceedingly steep and precipitous, and the water coursed along with the rapidity of a race- horse. We crossed the Weber on a bridge, and then we had a rough and troublesome causeway of brush and poles for half a mile, through a wet piece of ground. I had heard this place mentioned, previously,-as very dangerous, in miring animals; but the falling of the river, and some repairs, enabled us to pass it in perfect safety. Thus far we had been on the regular California route, and I was loth to leave the well-beaten road for the scarcely perceptible Indian trail which Inkley said -led to Grantsville, the place of our destination. Making a virtue of necessity, however, we turned off;, over a rough piece of ground, and descended the valley of the stream, amidst a labyrinth of mountains, irregular highlands, and frightful gorges, which it would be quite impossible to describe. I no longer wondered that so many travellers, hunters, and emigrant trains had become lost, in their long wandering among the mysterious passes.  I even began to fear that the same calamity would befall us, and hinted as much to Inkley, who laughed, and said that there was no danger. Of all countries, it seems to me that Utah is most lonely and desolate-most destitute of animal life. Mountains -         .     .   CMMPr-IN-OUT.         161 generally are the resort of game. With the single excep- tion of wild fowl, there is very little here. You may travel a whole day without hearing the voice of a solitary bird. The buffalo never leave the prairies; the Rocky-Mountain goats are scarce, and chiefly inhabit farther north; grizzly bears are seldom seen, and rarely caught; but a species of small rabbit abounds, in great plenty, and the grasshoppers in summer are almost a match for the locusts of Egypt. Our animals had become so weary that we concluded to halt for the night, when two-thirds of our journey was accomplished.  Our camping-ground was a beautiful valley, carpeted with herbage, and watered by a clear, cool stream, a tributary of the Weber. Our wagon contained plenty'of eatables, which were brought out at sunset, and we had a cold but delicious supper; for a good appetite gave it zest. Inkley, as usual, talked vivaciously, and praised every- thing, even to the luxury of a hard bed on the bottom of the wagon. Slumber readily comes to weariness, and I fell asleep, dreaming of vagabonds and Indians. Our repose was undisturbed. We were up by daylight, and, having untethered the mules, let them range two hours, for pas- ture, previous to resuming our journey. The remains of our supper served for breakfast';. and, having dispatched this, we were soon ready for a start. There is a certain sameness connected with this scenery that wearies the most ardent lover of nature. The mind wearies of sublimity-the eye becomes tired of resting on the great and grand.

I was really glad when the road diverged into u pleasant valley, and the village we sought appeared in the distance, though seeming little better than a camping-ground of sav- ages. It was simply a collection of huts, built in wigwam fashion, with few of the appurtenances or appearances of civilization. The nearer we approached, the more conspicu- ous became these features, until I could scarcely persuade myself that I was approaching a Christianized community. "Is that Grantsville?"I inquired, with some surprise. "It is," returned by guide. "Then all I have to say is, that report has spoken better of it than it deserves." "I hardly think so,"- he replied. "There is a flourishing church, chiefly composed of converted savages and half- breeds; and it could .hardly be expected that they would assume at'once all the peculiarities of civilized life." I assented to this, not without wondering how many vices of which they were previously innocent, had been engrafted, with this religious system, on their simple, unsophisticated l ;    -natures. They were certainly the most impudent and un- mannerly creatures I ever beheld. Noticing our approach, they came rushing out to meet us, surrounded the wagon, clambered up the sides, pillaged the remnants of our food, and actually began to examine the contents of our baggage, begging, all the while, in a whining, abject tone, for beads and trinkets. Inkley, in a loud voice, and with a flourish of   OCCUP&amp;TIONS OF THE WOMEN.       163 his whip, commanded them to desist, and, showing a small silver coin, declared that he would give it to the one who should first inform the elder of our arrival. That was a sufficient inducement, and off they all ran-men, women, and children-helter-skelter, whooping and shouting, and each one trying to outstrip his companions, while we brought up the rear at a moderately slow pace. I saw, at a glance, that Indian blood greatly predomi- nated in the population. They were athletic fellows, but vagabonds, to a man. Thiey had no regular occupation, but fished a little, hunted a little, and smoked and lounged a great deal. After the. usual fashion of savages, the women performed...the labor. Several were out in the fields, hoeing or weeding small patches of maize; and we passed by a place where two women were busily engaged in building a hut, a man. standing by, apparently giving directions, and overseeing the work. He nodded familiarly, and with an air of great satisfaction, to my companion. "( Are you acquainted with that fellow?"I asked.  Inkley replied that he was. t And who are those women under his command?" "His wives. He married them last week, both at a time, so that neither could claim precedence. They seem to be building a house." JIn consideration of my hearers, I forbore the expression of contempt that was rising to my throat.

Their singularity of appearance was greatly heightened by grotesqueness of apparel. Many of the women had on men's hats and coats, and some had even put on the worn- out and cast-off breeches of hunters and travellers, which were much too large for them. The children were keen, bright-looking little creatures, nearly nude, and with an expression of countenance and agility ofemotion strongly reminding one of the young of wild animals. I was all eyes and ears, till the wagon drew up before a building-differing little from the rest, though somewhat superior. "Does the elder live here?"I inquired. The answer was affirmative, with a wonder that he -didn't show himself, followed by the exclamation, "Here he comes." A man, evidently a half-breed, with a face the color of some rich, ripe berry, made his appearance, and bowed with such a ludicrous air to Inkley, that I could not forbear laughing. He had been drinking, which rendered his idio- matic pronunciation more harsh and guttural. "He good fellow, broder," he began. "Tub;in; tum in. Gad to see you," and he made a step forward, to meet us, when, his toe coming in contact with something on the floor, he lost his equilibrium, and fell prostrate. The noise brought out two women. Without noticing us, they seized "a   " swaP."         165 their lord, and bore him, notwithstanding his struggles to the contrary, into the cabin. "What shall we do?" said I, not relishing the idea of a drunken Indian host. "Get out, and go in, of course," said Inkley, leaping from. the wagon. I followed his example, and, after hitching the mules to a low stockade fence, we gathered up our hbggage, and entered the house,with a great train of men, women, and children at our heels. Such a motley set I never saw before, and hope never to see again. They were pushing, jamming, crowding, and trampling on each other, with the manifest intention of getting at us and our baggage. The word "swap" was continually on their tongues. First one and then another would grab at some article of my clothing, and, pulling it violently, would call out, "Swap?"Some of the women were actually determined to have my vest, whether or not; and, .with great want of discretion, I dis- played mj pocket-handkerchief, by wiping my face with it. Its brighlt olor instantly attracted attention, and one, more bold than che others, snatched it from my hands, and made off with it, leaving me to the consolation of thinking that the gang thereby was numerically Weakened. After being made to understand that we could not and would not "swap," they became curious to know what we possessed. Our fefusal- to gratify their curiosity only in- creased it, and, as a last resort, we unrolled our bundles, carefully separating, shaking out, and holding up each arti-  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC8190-00000084"/> 166      THE BUSBAND IN UTAH cle they contained, so that all might obtain a full view. A grunt of pleasure announced their satisfaction ; and, after a long time and much persuasion, they were induced to dis- perse. While this was going on, our Mormon dignitary overcame his drunkenness sufficiently to sit up, and signify by gestures and an unintelligible lingo, his deep anxiety to become possessed of our things. As I watched his coun- tenance, and noted the villainous expression of his: eye, I really began to be apprehensive for our safety, notwith- standing his sacerdotal- character. Three wives and seven children composed the family of this nondescript, and all were huddled in this little cabin, with a dirty stable in the rear. One of the women, evi- 3,      dently the oldest, and apparently mistress of the' establish- ment, invited Inkley to drive his mules around under the shelter, where she said they could stand in perfect security. While he was attending to them, the Indian elder became drowsy, with the fumes of intoxication. His head swayed to and fro, like a reed shaken: by the wind,; aiid he began muttering and spluttering, in a style unintelligible to me, but which occasioned great merriment to his wives. The youngest of these, going up beside him, gave' him a push that completely upset his centre of gravity, and tumbled him on the floor. In another moment he was sound asleep. It will readily be believed that this cabin was in a state of great filth, dirt, and confusion. What else could be expected, or who could have been neat in such a place 7? A 4og-kennel, in one corner of the hut, was swarming with #^-    DIS'GUSTING FOOD. 1o. inhabitants; and while I sat, looking around, the mistress  I  approached, seized ohe of the puppies by the hind legs, and deliberately proceeded to knock out its brains against the wall. I turned away my head, overpowered by a sickening sensation; and when I looked again, it was skinned and dressed. The prejudices of civilization were strong within me, and, with emotions of intense disgust, I saw her thrust it into a pot, with water, kindle a fire beneath it, and under- stood at once that it was designed for our supper. Her motions were not lost on Inkley.  He went to her, and, with the significance of words and gestures, succeeded in making her understand  that we had brought provisions with us, and consequently did not require her hospitality. With a nod, she pointed to the children--as much as to say that they would need it. We slept in our wagon again that night, and by morning our Indian host had become sufficiently sober to enter on the business of the church. These Mormon settlements, as auxiliaries and branches of the mother establishment in Zion, are subject to her government and supervision. Brig- ham Young, as supreme   pontiff, provides each one with a presiding bishop. or elder, whose duty it is to render a monthly account of all the affairs connected with his spirit- ual jurisdiction-the number of births, marriages, and con- verts; the amount of tithes ; and other matters in-general. With an appearance of great sincerity, the Indian--or, rather, half-breed-praised the zeal manifegted by the male members of his flock, which had run rampant to marry and ! .                   e  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC8190-00000085"/> 168      THE HUSBAND IN' UTAH. give in marriage, till not a single woman could be found in the neighborhood. Several times he Spoke of divorces, in connection with these marriages; and I ascertained, on inquiry, that the transferrence, or exchange, of wives, was nothing uncommon-that is, a woman would be divorced, by the church, from her husband, with the express under- standing that she should marry another man. He said that scarcely a day occurred in which he was not called upon to solemnize such connections, and that he believed the want of money to pay for it, prevented many more such matches from taking place. While we were conversing, a couple came into the cabin, though whether Indians, or half-breeds; it would be difficult to say. They were clasping each other's hands, and seemed very loving. The man stepped up to the elder, and whis- pered something to him which I could not hear, displaying, at the same time, a small silver coin, in the palm of his hand. "Nodder wife, eh?" said the Indian priest, with a grin: It would be impossible to transcribe their language, but I learned that the wives of this fellow having all deserted him for other men, he had begun taking a new stock. Not being particularly interested in their affairs, I strolled out for a walk, and, by going around the back way, and keep- ing out of sight as much as possible, managed to avoid having a crowd at my heels. Descending into a small val- ley on the eastern side of the village, by an Indian trail, I - was greatly surprised to see a large emigrant wagon, with   A FAMTLY OF EMGRATS.        169 169 six oxen quietly feeding on the luscious pasture, while an elderly man, a young woman, and three children, were sit- ting and lying around, in various attitudes. 'They were busily talking. "How I want to get away from here i" said the old man. "So do I," answered his companion. "I hope none of the fellows up yonder will discover us. They are very devils, and I shouldn't feel safe a moment if they knew we were here." '"Nor I either.." "Do you think they' would kill us?" inquired one of the children. "Don't know.   Can't say. Like as not," replied the mnan. I coughed slightly, to attract their attention. They started, looked towards me, and  said no more. I ap proached nearer, and addressed them. The old man had a thin, withered, and very brown face, with a speaking twinkle in his eye. -He  was dressed in clothes of the Quaker cut and color--a broad-brimmed, low-crowned, grey-colored hat, white cotton shirt, open in front, and without cra- vat, a long-skirted, snuff-colored coat, of coarse home. spun, short trowsers, of blue drilling, and heavy cowhide shoes.

"How can you talk so, father 1" said the woman. "There was a young girl in our company, the daughter of a widow considered rich, and certainly beautiful. She was a great favorite with the elder, who, though possessing several wives already, made a formal proposal for her hand. A young hunter from Illinois, not a Mormon, was likewise her'suitor.

CHAPTER IX. RETURN-OGDEN'S CITY, ETC. HE next morning, bright and early, we started on our return route, which lay through Ogden's City, another auxiliary branch of the Mormon Church. Inkley was very   I conversable, and found something to commend, even in the  detestable manners of the brutalized inhabitants of Grants- ville. "You should have seen these people one year ago, sir- one short year ago-and then you might form some estimate  of their advance in civilization. Why, bless my heart  they were savages then-had little knowledge of a Creator, none of a Saviour, and, if not exactly worshipping idols, had no regular attendance on public exercises of devotion. Yes, sir, their improvement has been little short of mirac- ulous." Such a palpable and manifest misrepresentation excited my risibility. He laughed, too, for company. "My character is original," he began, after a moment's silence. "I am aware of that. Most people delight in finding fault; it is my-abhorrence. In the ugliest counte- ? .

I find something or other to praise, wherever I go. It may be a little, still it is some. thing, and it always makes me feel better myself, and think better of my kind." "And what did you find at Grantsville?" That woman's ready hospitality struck me as a beautiful trait." I turned my head aside at the recollection. "You view the subject altogether in a wrong light," he said, reproachfully. "She was preparing for us the best that she had, and what she considered excellent herself. Could the most polished female have done better? Would she probably have done as well?" "But what proofs of an advance in civilization could you discover?-for, to tell the truth, I thought their manners much more disgusting and insolent than those of the wild, untutored natives." "You must make allowance for the many foreigners, of all classes and nations, that they are in the habit of seeing, and whose manners they insensibly imbibe. Ogden's City, however, is far superior.

About five miles, from Ogden City, we stopped'at an exquisitely neat adobe house, standing a short distance off the road, with a beautiful pine in front of it. The windows is were without glass, but drapery, of snowy muslin, restrained the currents of air, and admitted light. The master of the house, a hale, companionable fellow, gave us a gracious welcome, and his wife looked so happy, I wondered if poly- gamy could be there. Everything waq neat; nothing costly. Taste, not ornament, had evidently been consulted in the  .^ arrangement of the furniture. There was a table that had  ? been polished with soap and sand, till it shone almost like a mirror; several benches, white and clean as wood could be made ; a small dresser, on which some very nice patterns of queen's-ware cups and saucers were upturned, in the most approved style, while plates to match were ranged on their edges behind them. A small iron-furnace stood in one cor- ner of the fireplace, supporting the tea-kettle, bright and shining as a new dollar. Above this, on a nail, hung a spider, as free from soot as if it had never been touched by smoke. A rifle, powder-horn, and shot-pouch hung above -the mantelpiece, while some fishing tackle garnished the wall opposite. We had been seated but a short time, when the husband glanched towards his wife. She understood the signal, and, rising, with a smile, took her tea-kettle to a pail, very white   BROTHER' RIPLEYS.       1" and sweet, that the husband had just brought in, brimming full of cold, fresh- water. Then, while she was filling the kettle with the fluid, he kindled a warm, light, blaze in the furnace, over which it was placed for the second time. Not wishing to prolong our stay until after tea, I proposed going, when both the man and wife seemed disappointed, and pressingly invited us to share their hospitality. My companion, however, excused us, on the plea of the lateness of the hour, the darkness of the night, and -the miles we had to travel, before reaching our destination. I inquired of Inkley if this family were Mormon. "He said they were not, though the saints had made great efforts to secure their conversion. He thought they were incorrigi- ble, and given over to hardness of heart. After dark, we found much difficulty in keeping the road, there being. frequent forks, and nothing to guide us. We crossed two or three brooks, and several miry places, while I began to grow impatient, when a cluster of lights appeared in the distance. - We soon reached a long, low cabin, which Inkley said was brother, Ripley's, and that we could be com- fortably entertained. This was, indeed, good news. The door was shut, to keep out the mosquitoes; but,- hearing our steps, the good man came, opened it, and asked us to enter. It was cheerful and comforting within, and formed an agreeable contrast with the damp, dark night. A bright lamp diffused a mellow light through the apartment, and a balsamic odorbreathed from the low fire of scented wood. A door to the right, opened to the background of supper- 8*  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC8190-00000090"/> 178      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. table and kitchen; and a nice, stout, hale-looking, but old- ish lady, in a tieat cap, came forth to welcome ur, while a boy was dispatched to attend to the mules. \ / When wewere somewhat rested, supper was a nounced by a negress, in a very white bib, and a very red( turban. There were several preparations of swine's flesh, fresh fish, i chicken, wheat and corn bread, with very rich short cakes  / and two or three kinds of sweetmeats. Both tea and cof were served, and water, cooled with the luxury of ice. f After supper, while Mrs. Ripley was absent from the room, superintending her domestic affairs, Mr. Inkley inquired of our host whether or not he had taken a second wife. "I have not," said Ripley, "and probably never shall. : t One good wife, like mine, is worth more to a man than a dozen poor ones. I have long thought that." "But it is the duty of the saints, you know." -"I don't know any such thing. If a man chooses to curse himself with more than one wife, I have nothing to say. If he remains contented with one, it is quite as well, in my opinion."         . "You will probably change your mind," said Inkley, "when the right one crosses your path." "I think not," answered Ripley. "For twenty years-I    : have lived in an atmosphere of domestic happiness. 'My expectations of connubial felicity have been fully verified. In sickness and in health, in poverty and wealth, my wife  has been the sun that diffused life and light and joy through the sphere in which I moved. At my advanced period of     -  .                 ,   ,'   A COMFORTARJLPi APARTMENT.     - 179 life, with my knowledge of womankind and the world, it would scarcely be policy to attempt the experiment." Here Mrs. Ripley came in, and the subject was dropped Her husband arose, and presented her with a chair, with all the gallantry of youth; and it was beautiful to see the itle y courtesies and attentions they bestowed on each other, and which are generally so sadly neglected in the marriage state. I could ot help hoping that the great good-sense and real happiness of this amiable old gentleman would pre- serve him from ever listening to the tempter, whose counsel, in his case, at least, would be a certain prelude of misery and disappointment. The room in which we lodged that night; was one of the best I had seen in the 'Mormon country.  All its appoin t- ments and furniture bespoke the neat and thrifty housewife. Nothing at loose ends, or out of place. Nothing neglected for some one else to oversee. Our bed-chamber was a house in itself, separated from the main building, though connected with it by a  platform or gallery in front. The window- sashes had been raised, for ventilation, and their places sup- plied by mosquito-curtains. 'Two stuffed easy-chairs stood near the fireplace, each with a tub of tepid water, to bathe our weary feet,. before it, while a' small lamp shed just enough light to render the apartment pleasant. Every-: thing for comfort and convenience was so much superior to what I had been 'accustomed to see in this country, that I could not help noticing and remarking on it to my com-  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC8190-00000091"/> 180      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. panion. Strange to say, however, he was rather disposed to cavil: and find fault, thus revealing a phase of character by no means singular.  The next day we visited the elder, and, through all the Mormon empire, I, have not seen a man more truly and really lovable and worthy. To my infinite surprise, he had no wife at all, and his house was kept in order by a youthful niece Though E rigid Mormon in other respects, he was bitterly opposed to polygamy, and had several times refused his niece to the solicitations of men with families. His   j example had not been without its influence. A majority of those within his spiritual jurisdiction had but one wife--few,  if any, had more than two; and I was ready to make the  inquiry,.if the superiority of Ogden's City over other Mor- mon neighborhoods was to be attributed to this fact. Accompanied by the elder, we visited the tabernacle, which was not remarkable for architectural taste or beauty, though answering all the ends of a roomy structure. It is large on the ground, very low, and has a wretchedly tame  - appearance. However, father Smith, our guide, informed me that when the church became-sufficiently wealthy, an- other and better building would be reared, and the present one removed, and applied to other purposes.. Many excellent farms are in this neighborhood. Fine meadow and pasture lands border the river- on which the city stands, and which bears the same name. I noticed very fine herds of cattle, and sheep of improved breeds. s - Wi,   TRADITIONS OF OGDEN'S HOLE.      181 The whole region had an air of pastoral simplicity, blent with romantic associations, and I became insensibly in love with it. The city itself (which is merely a thickly-settled neighbor- hood, or large village) is near the mountains-huge, frown- ing battlements, that seem to pierce the clouds. Along their sides you can trace the wavy paths made by the moc- casined feet of the Indians, in finding their way to their inaccessible dens and caverns among the heights. Ogden's Hole, a noted place in this region, is celebrated for one of those desperate encounters between white men and savages which are fast becoming traditionary. Who knows but that the future pen of the novelist may make it famous as Ellerslie and Wallace's Cave. It is simply a quiet, sequestered nook of the canon, whence the river flows, in which one Ogden, with a party of white hunters, made a successful stand against a host of Indians. It-is noted,-too, as the sceAe of a romance of softer char- acter and more recent date: One of the Indian chiefs had a beautiful daughter, who was sought after, in marriage, by a roving hunter, named White. The belle of the wilder- ness could not resist the fascinations of the white man. They were married according to the Indian mode, and took up their residence in Ogden's Hole. The luxuries and appli- ances of civilization were wanting in their retreat, yet they- were happy and; comfortable. His rifle supplied them with food. He contended successfully with the grizzly bear, and dragged the panther from  his laiiP  Such exhibitions of  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC8190-00000092"/> 182      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH.  strength and bravery gave him great influence over the natives. His retreat, sheltered from tempests, remained  green the entire year, and he gathered about him a remark- ably fine herd of cattle. These he drove off to California, and returned with a splendid lot of horses. His reputed  wealth tempted the cupidity of his Mormon neighbors.  Then he was not a believer in their faith, and did not hesi- ii tate to reprove their practices. He went out hunting, one day, but did not return. His wife was alarmed, and, with her relatives, instituted a search. They found him dead,  from the effects of a bullet that had penetrated his brain. But who aimed the murderous weapon? Alas I the rocks and deep glens had no tongue for mortal ears. His pro- perty was seized, under some pretense, and eventually distri- buted among the dignitaries of the Mormon church, though,  i to the credit of father Smith, be it said, he returned his portion to the bereaved widow and her. orphan babes. I heard of many such instances, and cannot wonder that the  Mormons are greatly detested   Ogden's City boasts, likewis a drinking-house or tavern, which I visited, from sheer curiosity. I had been informed that one Goodall, a man famous through all the West for his narrow escapes and daring exploits, was there to be seen, with his men; and I went to' look at them, as to a collection of natural curiosities, or a menagerie of strange animals. They were lounging around the door, and in the house, which seemed filled with them-swarthy Mexicans and Indians, of nameless tribes, dressed in 'their native cos-   GOODAIL  AND HS HORSE.      183 tumes. There was also a Lipan, with the keen, fiery eyes peculiar to his race; and two Pinos, from the interior of New-Mexico. A number of thieving, murdering Camanches exhibited their hateful physiognomies; and the whole com- pany had such a vagabond look, that I wondered Goodall was not afraid of them. Goodall hails from New-York State, where he left a wife and several children, though he has since assumed the mar- riage relation in nearly or quite all the native tribes among whom he has traded. It gives him influence, and, no doubt, the Indian belles are glad to secure so attractive a lover. His costume is decidedly picturesque. It consists of ri'lh embroidered buckskin pants and moccasins, exhibiting a great degree of taste. A gaudy belt around his waist, garnished with- weapons, giving him the appearance of a finished mountain-rover. Several very large dogs, of the Newfoundland and Spanish breeds, were attached to his train, and he rode, when in motion, one of the finest horses I ever beheld. I was strongly reminded of Dick Turpin's favorite Black Bess, while listening to the anecdotes related of this won, derful animal. Goodall declared! that he could do every- thing but talk, and had a way of expressing himself that no one could misunderstand.  He seems to be perfectly aware that he is a privileged being-allows no one to mount him but his master, and domineers like a despot over every other horse or animal that comes in his way. Marvellous stories are told of him. How he saved his mas-  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC8190-00000093"/> 184:      THE tUSlSAD  N..

Goodall was no friend to the Mormons; it was business, and that alone, vyhich induced him to pass through their territory. He had a drove of sheep, quartered at a little  distance in the valley. At first, he took me for one of the  Mormons, and was rather shy; but ascertaining that such  was not the case-that I was simply a tourist, travelling for instruction and amusement-he became communicative, and invited me out to see his camp. The sheep-long-legged, coarse-woolled, and black-nosed animals-were quietly feed- ing, in a beautiful pasture-ground near the "corral," into  which they were gathered at night, and which consisted of upright logs, stockade fashion. I inquired if there was not danger that some of the animals would be stolen.   , "Danger '1" he replied. Of course, there is danger--, otherwise there would be no necessity for keeping a gang to watch them." I asked whom he feared. His reply was characteristic, and to the point-- , "The Mormons, of course." I replied that the Mormons seemed to bear rather a bad name, but I supposed that there must be honest men among  them.  "Not a damn one 1" he answered, quickly. "Not a damn i   GOODALL'S OPINIuN OF THE MORMONS.    185 one   Stranger, I've always knowed 'em. I knowed Jo Smith, and a greater rascal never trod shoe-leather. I knowed Brigham Young when he was a boy. We went to school together.  I knowed Elder Gould, and hundreds more; and I never yet knew one that could be trusted. To lie, and steal, and cheat, is a part of their religion. I say it is !" " But I should think that among so many, there must be some good and sincere men." "Not a damn one I Not a damn one 1" he repeated. "It takes a good while to find them out, sometimes; but the knowledge will surely come." "I hope it may not." "Stranger," he continued, 'until I came among these Mormons, I had faith in human nature. I have none now. I had faith in virtue, in purity, and in goodness. It is all gone. I curse them, because they have cursed me with the sight of their inborn depravity. They will curse you in the same manner." I could hardly forbear smiling at his earnestness. The hunters and traders cherish, very generally, an ill-feeling towards the Mormons. This might partly be explained without accusing either party of dishono r or actual dishon- esty. 'The Mormons have contrived to absorb most of the Indian trade; and the herding business is much less profit- able, since so many have embarked in it. Then, too, the hunting-grounds have been materially lessened in extent, the game rapidly diminished, and the natives thereby incited to &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC8190-00000094"/> 186      TWE  USBAND IN UTAH.  acts of violence and opposition to the wishes and interests of those they had formerly treated and regarded as friends. "What everybody says, must be true," is an iold adage;  I 6ind all agree in telling one story about the Mormons, and attributing to them the grossest deception and the foulest ! vices.                           i    ,ii   A 'AT T FROM FREDEBIOK B- ..     187 CHAPTER X.

I was weary, and  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC8190-00000095"/> 188      THE HUSBADm IN UTAH. so postponed going until morning. When morning came, breakfast was: later than usual, and it was near ten o'clock before I could obey the summons. My heart misgave me.    I I felt almost certain that something unusual had happened, though its nature I failed to define. I quickened my pace, only'pausing to salute two or three acquaintances, and soon arrived at the place. The door was shut, and I knocked softly. . "'Come in," said a voice that I knew to be Frederick's. I entered the apartment, when the first object that met my view was the old man, apparently in the last agonies. His son was bending over him, with all the tenderness of a woman, wiping the death-damps from his brow, moistening his parched tongue, and otherwise administering to- his phy-  sical comfort. He pressed my hand, in silence, glanced at the sufferer, and resumed his post by the bedside. I sat down-on a low bench, an-interested spectator in the scene. The old man's senses were wandering. He muttered, scarce intelligibly, of the days and events of his youth. His marriage, the birth of his child, and their happiness in the cottage-home, all came back,.in pleasing retrospect. At  length his tone changed, his words became fewer and more  i distinct, and he suddenly woke to recollection. We both knew it to be the last flickering beam of life and intellect, and he felt it so himself. Holding out his hand 'to his, son, i he said, "I am going to meet your mother, Frederick. She  was with me, just now ; but her garments were white, and her face was that of an angel's." 4                            .   DEATH OF FREDERIOKS FATHER.      189 Overcome by the violence of his emotions, the strong man sobbed aloud. "Now, don't-don't-my son," he said. "I am an old man. My time has come. It is meet that I should go. I die in the faith." - " What faith, father ?" " Of the Lord Jesus Christ," and he fell back, dead. Frederick lifted his hands, and said, " May you meet my mother in that land where there is neither change nor apos- tasy V" " 0 God, it is a fearful thing, To see the human soul take wing!" More fearful, perhaps, in the stillness, and gloom, and sorrow of a home to be bereaved, than in the earthquake, the storm, or the battle, where all the softer and tenderer emo- tions are wrought to an intensity of excitement that borders on sublimity. After the lapse of a few moments, I arose, and proceeded to perform the last sad offices of affection for the dead, dis- posing the decent limbs, folding the meek hands over the quiet breast, and sealing the waxen eyelids in an attitude of slumber. The next day was appointed for the funeral, which Frederick decided to keep secret as. possible. With the assistance of a few friends, a coffin was procured, and the robes for the dead prepared. "No Mormon has been spoken to," said Frederick. "I I hope they will remain in entire ignorance of what is going on."  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC8190-00000096"/> 190        THE aiUSIBAND 1 UTAH. "For your sake, I hope so, too, though it is rather, unlikely." A slight noise at the window attracted my attention, and, looking around, I beheld a pair of glaring eyes. "Who is there?"I whispered to Frederick; pointing towards them. But, before he could turn, they had disap- peared. "The vultures will soon be here," he said, and he spoke truly. When a Mormon dies, the church assumes the right to look after his property, if he is possessed of any. In half an hour, a priest was at the door. He came in with- out ceremony of knocking, and deported himself with an insolence altogether unbearable. "So our brother has gone," he said. "Peace to his memory I Dying happily, as a Gentile never dies; and- certain of taking his place in the promised land, at the last day."       - "-My father died in the faith of Christ, and in no other," said Frederick, somewhat tartly. "Ours is the faith of Christ," said the priest. "He was one of us; our brother. He loved our institutions; he followed our practices. What are you, to assume the dicta- tion of affairs? That prerogative belongs to the church." "Begone i" said Frederick. "I have not words to waste on such a reptile." The countenance of the priest actually assumed a fiendish expression. "Time will manifest who is lord here," he muttered, and went out.   A DISGRACOEU L SO6C1.      191 "He has gone for a reinforcement," I observed. "This is dreadful!" said Frederick. "The necessity of quarrelling over the body of so near and dear a relative!" In a few minutes the priest returned, leading the woman who, in thfe Mormon ritual, had been "sealed" to that old man as his second wife, and whom Frederick had expelled from the house. "The church," said the priest, addressing her, "delegates you the mistress here. - Take possession and authority." "She shall not!" said Frederick. "She shall!" said the priest. "He is her husband."  "He is my father." The hag, meanwhile, stood a silent, though apparently well-pleased spectator. Seeing how matters must terminate, I slipped from the room, without saying a word to any one, ran to the hotel of Colonel Kinney, where I knew that the officers of the mili- tary were boarding. Fortunately, the commandant was dis- engaged. He received me graciously, listened to my state- ment of the pending difficulty, and immediately dispatched a corporal, at the head of his platoon,-to occupy the pre- mises, and see that order was maintained. As I anticipated, the house was filled with Mormons, on my return. Frederick was lying, bound, on the floor, and that hideous woman sitting beside the corpse. They were evidently disconcerted when the military appeared, and the priest grew wonderfully respectful when addressing the offi- cer. He seemed to comprehend affairs at a glance, ordered   &#xD;<pb n="192" xml:id="VAC8190-00000097"/> 192      THE HUSBAND IN UTAE.  them all to disperse and departf assured the woman that it was no place for her-that she looked much more like going into a wash-tub than to a funeral-and carried out his cornm mands by compelling obedience. -The priest asserted his right to stay, as a minister of religion; but the gallant soldier plai lytd him that his orders were imperative, without distinction of class or profession. Uttering impre- cations against the soldiers, the government, and every- thing in general that might dare to interfere with the liberties of the saints, he departed.. Released from the ignominious cords with which his enemies had bound him, Frederick stood again beside his dead. The soldiers-hushed, reverent, and uncovered, in the presence of death-occupied one side of the house. I sat near, conscious that the mourner required my presence, as a support in this hour of affliction. To avoid the public gaze-above all, to prevent the attendance of those whose faith he loathed, and whose presence he hated-Frederick determined that the burial should take place at midnight. "The hour is unseemly," I said, "for such as your father-a peaceful and good man. It would do well for a brigand-a man of war and bloodshed-but not for such as him."   "We are among brigands," he replied, and his resolution- remained unchanged. That night, therefore, when the city was silent with slumber, the procession moved from the house, and slowly   &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-193" xml:id="VAC8190-00000098"/> ,-   : , ' ,i ,1 \--. .

There they paused, and, after a ,little preparation, lowered down the coffin, by the, strong glare of torches, held high above their heads by the others in . attendance. Then followed the striking of spades in the"gravelly earth, and the ringing of clods- on' the coffin-sounds so fearful and ominous- to the human-- heart. RWhen tl' cavty was filled,. the soldiers,: at agw'ord from their commander, moved silently-and reverently away, leaving us alone, .with, the deep solemnity. of darkness around us, and the stars' watching above.

A -light broke into my mind, but I said nothing. He passed around the room, in the darkness, and finally, with outstretched hands, caught hold of me. "One of two things is certain," he remarked-" that we have either mistaken the place, or those wretches have been here and stripped the house in our absence. Fortunately, if I cannot find a candle, I can strike a match." He did so, and applied it to some fragments of dry wood, which instantly illuminated -the apartment. Every vestige of the furniture had been removed--the table, chairs, and bed; in short, all the movables. "This is more than I expected!" said Frederick, with a look of blank amazement: The whole affair was so singular, I could not wonder at his surprise. "Only another proof of their artfulness, and the constant espionage they practise," he continued. "Many a time the uneasy consciousness of the probable presence of some one when I was not assured of his or her being near, has made me nervous. I suppose -they feared that something might escape their brigandism, if they waited till morning. Well, I hope they are satisfied." r Very heartily I echoed the devout wish, and proposed that we should Adjourn to my boarding-house. "Do you live With a Mormon?"5 inquired "Frederick. Being assured that I did, he declined the invitatipn, -           -     A MO]RMOS' THEATRE.       195 because he had formed the solemn resolution never, on any condition; to -accept hospitality from a people by whom his parents had been so grievously wronged and deceived. "Where, then, will you go?"I inquired. "To the house of Mrs. Canfield, my mother's best friend." "Mrs. Canfield, the actress?"I echoed, in some surprise. "The same."- -"But she is a Mormon." "You mistake. Policy induces her to assume a friendli- ness towards them, which she is far from feeling. Come, -let us be going." Together we left the empty house, and passed along the street; but I could not reconcile it with my notions of pro- priety, to ask, at such an hour, the hospitality of a stranger- lady, and so we separated, for the time.     4 I cannot tell how the next day passed. I, suppose like many others that leave no abiding impression. I never look out for adventures-they are wearisome. I care little about incidents-they are commonplace. But that night I went to the theatre. Yes, friends, a veritable Mormon theatre; for, whether you do or not, you should know that these worthies are quite as fond of carnal pleasures as the Gentiles, though not quite so well fixed for enjoying them. The building dedicated to the worship of Thespis bears little comparison to those of the same character in our Eastern "cities. It wants their style, their finish, their ele- gant adaptation to comfort and convenience; yet this deficiency is more than made up!by the novelty of every- i.  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC8190-00000100"/> 196      THE HTUSBAND IN UTAH. thing around you, and the singular appearance of the hete- rogeneous crowd that throng on every, side. The Mormon theatre is always well filled. There meet the hunters from the head-waters of the Colorado, the falls of the-Columbia, and the great northern lakes'of Canada. Here the Santa-Fd trader and New-Mexican stand side by side with the Dane, Norwegian, and German. Here soldiers in uniform jostle plain citizens, or stately Indian chiefs, in all the 'glory of war-paint and feathers, bend their stern brows inflexibly and immovably over the scene. Last, though. not least, are the stately elders and their fair spouses. The High Priest usually appears with ten or a dozen, Kimball with as many more, Dr. Richards-with nine, and Parley Pratt with an equal number. I was there early, and it was really amusing to see these dignitaries of the church provide seats for the members of their harems. The gentleman would colme in first, followed by his wives, in -the order of two by two. He would look around, as if calculating distances-and numbers. If there was an empty seat, well and good. He took possession of the middle, and his ladies ranged themselves on either side of him--the youngest and fairest, next his person ; the old- est and ugliest on the outside. Let me hazard the compari- son of some stately knight of the barnyard, on his perch, accompanied by his numerous and faithful retinue of females  The youngest ladies, as the favorites of their husbands for the time, were the best dressed, and many of them were decidedly beautiful.

HOW -TO TELL A FRENCHWOMAN.      197 position of ninth or tenth wife to old and not particularly handsome men, excited my wonder; and I was beginning to speculate on the weakness' and folly of women, in a man- 'ner that would have gained me no credit among the strong- minded sisterhood, when my meditations were disturbed by a little Frenchwoman, who came in and seated herself very unceremoniously beside me. Mademoiselle was not timid. It made no difference to her that we had not been introduced; and my gallantry would not permit me to treat a lady with rudeness, under any circumstances. With the utmost familiarity she began a conversation, and my curiosity impelled me to listed and reply. "How do you know that she was a Frenchwoman, if you were strangers?" says one. I knew it by her appearance; by the becoming taste manifested in her dress; by the knots and bows of ribbon, the sprigs of flowers, and pearl ornaments, conspicuously displayed on her person, to say nothing of the thousand little graces and arts, which others may imitate artificially, but which seem natural only' to them. All the world over, you can tell a Frenchwoman; and, before she had spoken, I knew, intuitively, that she was such. "Do you see dat beautiful lady, yonder?" she asked, with the most charming confidence. "Where?" "Dat one setting next Brigham, de prophet." Mademoiselle spoke with sufficient foreign accent to ren-  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC8190-00000101"/> 198      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH.              V der her conversation interesting, but she was much too artful  to disgust a fastidious English ear by an ungrammatic or idiomatic style. "I see her."                        ^ I did, indeed. I had rested my eyes, for some moments, on her sylph-like form--her fair neck, bosom, and arms, veiled, not covered, by a thin scarf of gauze lace-her bright hair, her patrician features, their damask bloom, and the flash of conscious triumph that lighted her eye. Why had she come here to practise her fascinations! Mademoiselle recalled my wandering thoughts. "Dat lady be forty years old." "Impossible!" "FactI I know. We came to California, in de same steamer, from la belle France-cher Paris. Den we come  here." "What for?"     - "Oui ; Monsieur mustn't be curus! Ver good reason; -ver good, indeed." I assured her there was no necessity for telling, and turned my attention to the play. The Frenchwoman, how- sever, was not to be put off. She touched my elbow. I looked around. "Dat lady-would Monsieur like to hear her history?" she asked , "Perhaps so, at some other time." "Oui'; Monsieur wishes to see de play." "I do."   MANNERS AT THE THEATRE.       199 "Ver well, not hinder," and she turned away. After sitting a few minutes in silence, she arose, flirted away, and sat down by another gentleman, with whom she was soon deeply engaged in conversation. He evidently admired her,   A and was not bashful about making it known, while a woman, probably his wife, sat on the other side of him, and mani- fested great uneasiness. The utmost latitude in manners prevails at the theatre. The private drawing-room of Rosanna Townsend would never have-tolerated such scenes as are publicly enacted there; and tht worst of it is, there is no distinction. In our theatres, the disreputable characters occupy certain places-here they are mixed up with the rest. The acting was on a stage, raised three or four feet above the floor of the room occupied by the spectators. The play was the Lady of Lyons, of which the Mormons are exces- sively fond. It ran season after season, with little varia- tion and they were dissatisfied when another was substituted in its stead. On this occasion, the performance was good, and might be relished by one able to divert his mind from other scenes passing around him. Some of the chief actors exhibited decided ability. Among these, Mrs. Canfield, as the mother of Claude, performed her part admnirably, and Mrs. Wheelock, who represented Pauline, to the life. The latter is very beautiful. Her face beams with intelli- gence, and hUr voice is thrillingly melodious. Her husband having been absent in Australia nearly two years, a multi-  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC8190-00000102"/> o00       THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. tude of saints, prophets, and apostles are in full chase after  her. According to Mormon theology, the absence of a hus- band releases the wife from all obligation, and she is at per- fect liberty to form a union, at pleasure, with another man.  One of the most eager in this pursuit, is the man who enacted the part of Claude, and whose passionate protesta- tions had an air of the sincerest reality. Neither were the (/ other actors indifferent to her charms. Indeed, their mani- festations of gallantry seriously interfered with the perform- anee intended for the public amusement. MRS. CANFIELD Is an, English woman, from Bath, who, having been deserted by her husband, has been obliged to resort to the stage, to : obtain bread for her children. I called on Frederick, at her' house, to-day. She received me with great affability, and related, for my entertainment, many interesting incidents connected with her travels and adventures. The room was garnished with pictures and mementoes of her native city, and her eyes filleO mith tears, while explaining the particular points of interest, or relating the associations that gave to each its relative value. She was not a believer in Mormon- ism, as she assured me, but necessity impelled her stay among them. At first, she tried to obtain a livelihood by sewing, and found plenty of employment, but little pay. Then she resorted to school-teaching, with even worse suc- cess; and finally, as a last experiment, attempted the stage,   MRS. OANim LD.        201 Here her fine talent for music procured her notoriety, and she might have found it profitable had it not been for the unusual number of free-tickets, which admit the elders and their families. I could not but be aware that one so good, beautiful, and intelligent, could not remain long in Mormondom without a train of suitors, and I subsequently learned that her hand had been sought by several men, some of whom were already husbands. But their offers were firmly, though respectfully, declined. Her conscience would not permit her to form a second marriage, until she was assured of her husband's death; but, under no consideration, would she ever be united with a sensual polygamist. ,  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC8190-00000103"/> 202      THE RMY8BAD IN UTAH. CHAPTER XI. THE TABERNACLE-FORM OF MORMON WORSHP- SPECIMEN OF PREACHNG, ETC, TEAR the Mormon theatre, and somewhat resembling it in appearance and capaciousness, is the Tabernacle- not the first one that was built, though it occupies the same situation. The first building was large on the ground, and presented the appearance of an immense oblong box. In 1854, this was taken down and removed, to make way for the magnificent temple that stands there now. It is hand- somely built of stone, and makes some pretensions to archi- tectural beauty, though chiefly remarkable for its immense size. It is said to be capable of accommodating five thou-  sand persons, with ease; and is surrounded by a high Wall, reared wih immense cost and labor. You enter by large folding-doors in the east end, which face the platform occu- pied by the priests and elders in the west. The seats are arranged in the form of an amphitheatre, and all are enabled to gratify their devotion and curiosity, by a plain view of those who conduct the worship. I attended once, and but once, there being little in the service that could interest the   ASSEMBRLAGE AT THE TABERNACLE.     203 sympathies, and still less that &amp;ould affect the understand- ing. Wanting in the plain, severe simplicity of the Protes- tant worship, it has none of the pomp and gorgeousness of the Catholic ceremonial. Yet Mormonism is in its infancy. It wants the prestige of age, to render it venerable; it requires the combined efforts of literature and art, of good taste, sound sense, and elegant ideas, to perfect its form of worship: Centuries of toil, study, and the most approved methods of art, combined with unbounded wealth, have "given to the Catholic Church its perfection in -appliances to captivate the senses. What may not the Mormons in eighteen centuries become? I conld not help thinking this, as, under the guidance of Elder Snow,(g.) I went up to the Tabernacle, one Sunday morning, and saw the immense assemblage gathered there from the four quarters of the globe. Unlike the Eastern polygamists, the Mormons do not attempt to confine their wives, or keep them secreted from the gaze of others. All entered the church promiscuously, and sat just as it hap- pened, though, generally, the husband placed himself in the 'midst of his wives. It was a strange assemblage, yet, who could expect anything better? And think you the followers of Christianity, in the first century of its existence, ap- peared much more respectable to the votaries of the fash- ionable religions of the day? How would they have char- acterized its professors as low, debauched, stupid, ignorant, and even deficient in the common attributes of humanity I How would they have scoffed, and jeered, and mocked them,  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC8190-00000104"/> 204      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. prophesying their utter extinction in a few short years I There was an extinction, it is true; but who were the victims. The old faith disappeared-the new triumphed. The rites of the 'Mormon worship open with singing and a full band of music. Many of the females had good voices, and the strain was solemn and impressive. When this was concluded, Brigham Young offered a prayer, for "Zion in the tops of the mountains" in particular, and for the saints all over the world in general. The Gentiles, of course,  e were excluded from the benefits of this petition. His dis- course was short, yet pertinent. He exhorted them to obedience and union, and reminded them that many females were yet unprovided with husbands, who ought to be mar- ried, and giving children to the church. "I think," he con- tinued, " that I have set you a good example. My wives outnumber those of David, and children, like olive-plants, gather about my table." He finished, and sat down, when the music struck up "Bruce's Address," followed bye' Old Lang Syne." It ceased, and Elder Cumming arose. He is tall, and remark- ably strong-built. While surveying his athletic form and sinewy limbs, joined to a countenance not particularly expressive of intelligence, I thought how much better he was adapted to agriculture, or some useful mechanic art, than in dealing out harangues on subjects of which his audience were quite as well qualified to judge as himself, His discourse abounded in anecdote, all relating to what seemed of chief interest to them-taking new wives. He o     THE DUTY OF MEN.         205 rated those women soundly, who, having the opportunity, neglect to get married; and said that a brother was deserving of "hell-fire" if he permitted a woman to remain single without making her an offer. "Who cares if she is old, and ugly, and deformed?--her child will be young, and probably beautiful. If she has no child, why, God has ordained it, and you have done your duty. When walking along' the streets, I make it a practice to inquire of every stranger woman I meet, whose wife she is. To this, many of my sisters here can testify. If she tells the name of her husband, I bless her, and say,' Go on your way rejoicing; have children, and rear them up for Zion I' If she has no husband, I bid her begone, and- get one." There was no evidence of a devotional spirit, though much that was said elicited the boisterous mirth of the audience. While listening to these discourses, I could not help thinking that the Mormons seemed to regard marriage not as a meanis for promoting social happiness, but solely as a method for th6 most convenient propagation of the race. Yet this view is not novel, and has been frequently enter- tained by restless and aspiring spirits. Augustus, after devastating the earth to promote his schemes of ambition, sought to replenish it again, by recommending, and even in some cases enforcing, marriage; and complained bitterly of the dancing-girls, and other women, who refused to "give children to the republic." Yet, why did he wish this? To increase the sum of human happiness, or promote the wel- fare of the race? No such thing; but that his empire  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC8190-00000105"/> 206       THE BUSBAND IN iTAH. might be replenished with taxable subjects, and his armies filled with new, soldiers. Bonaparte had the same idea in view, when he said that the greatest woman was the one who .had' borne the most children-which is certainly a great scandal on the sex, as it must be better, nobler, greater, to bear, bring up, and suitably educate two children, than to. simply give birth to a dozen poor, miserable, little outcasts, who ultimately come to the state-prison, poor-house, or gallows. The great desire of the Mormons to have children, and increase in population, displays, to us, some ulterior motive. They are looking forward, down the long vista of the future, to wealth and power--to independence, rank, and distin-- tion, among the nations of the earth. The examples of Moses and Mohannmed are before them, and the lessons of ages have not been lost. But the service was yet unfinished, and another speaker was on the floor. His words were nearly as follows: ': Now, my dear friends, what a dreadful thing it would be, if, after all your trials and afflictions, your perils in crossing the deep (for many before me have come from countries -beyond the sea)--after all this, and your difficul- ties and dangers in the howling wilderness, what a dreadful thing it would be to lose your inheritance among the saints I - ' Other sins are venal, other transgressions may be for- given, but there is no hope for him who, having once known the good way, has turned back.

My sisters, it is nothing to me-you must not imagine that it makes a particle of difference with me--whether you are married or not; but it does make a difference to you, and that a verv great one. Why, know you not that unless a woman is sealed or married to a man, and that man a true disciple, there can be no hope of her salvation? "Consider well, then, that if you lose your souls-your precious, immortal souls-by remaining single, you have- nobody but yourselves to blame. I have told you. You know that. And the good brothers are ready and willing to assistfyou, if you wfll only let them. Let them I Why, a woman, Tther than remain unmarried, should ask some elder or saintly brother to bestow on her the seal of salvation. "And, my dear sisters, there are other subjects on which I wish to speak. I have been informed that some of you have laid stumbling-blocks in the way of your husbands when they have proposed to seal other females. You have tried, by tears, and protestations, and rebellion, to hinder them from performing such duties. Know ye not that these things are deserving of damnation?. Know ye not that, in all things, your husbands are your superiors; that they stand to you in the place of God; and that obedience- unqualified,- unquestioning obedience-is your first, I had almost said your only, duty, as in that all others are com. prised.             .  .     &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC8190-00000106"/> 208      THE HlUSBAND IN UTAH. "Now, my sisters, an important thing for you to remem- ber is this: If your husbands want more wives, you must help to get them ; and then you must be peaceable, and not quarrel, and lie, and filch from each other, but live in har- mony, with all loving-kindness and charity. What a dread- ful thing it would be if the soul of one woman, through your opposition to her union with your husband, should be lost'l And, being in torments unspeakable, would she not forever cry out against you?" There was much more in a similar strain and to the same purpose, though, as literary efforts, they were beneath criti- cism. I returned home for dinner, and, while we were at table, Mr. Inkley inquired my opinion of the last discourse, declar- ing that it met his unqualified approbation. "Then you will be on the lookout for another wife, I suppose," was my reply, glancing towards Sarah, who sat at the table. She tossed her head, with an expression of the deepest scorn. "That such is my duty, I -own," he said, with affected gravity; "though it sorely taxes my energies to provide for those I now have." "Well thought of i" ejaculated Sarah. "It would be a pity," I said, "for any woman to lose her immortal soul, because, no man could afford to find her in f bread and butter. She might be sealed, to secure her sal- vation, and then left to take care of herself." "That is the way with many of them," said Sarah.   A CURIOUS GUARANTEE  TO SALYATION.   209 i"Of who?" "Why, these women that work about as nurses and assistants in families. You saw that very old lady who sat just before you, I suppose?" "That one dressed in blafk, who seemed so deeply inter ested in the services?"I asked. "The same," she answered. "Well, that old woman is eighty-five next September, and she has been sealed to Brigham Young just one month. She came on here with her children, though an unbeliever. But, recently, she became a convert, and the next thing was to be sealed. In consequence of her age and infirmities, the brothers hesi- tated to perform the duty, until the first and best one of all, touched by the consideration of her necessities, con- sented to become her husband, on the condition that she should remain with her children, and not be dependent on him for support or a home." "Then I suppose that the prophet has many such wives, or sealed ones?" "He has, indeed, more than any one knows of-probably more than he remembers himself." S "And this is considered' a certain guarantee of salva- tion'?"  "It is; and hence young girls and maidens are often sealed long before the age of puberty. I have witnessed the sealing of children not more than eight years old." "I have never heard of this before." "Very likely. There are many things among us that you  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC8190-00000107"/> 210      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. have never heard of; many rites and ceremonies known only to the initiated; many plans and purposes you could never guess." "But this sealing of young girls is against nature and religion." "Not more so than betrothals among the Jews, and yet this people had a warrant direct from heaven for all they did." "The examples of the Jews have been frequently quoted to furnish props for bad and mistaken conduct or ideas, by bad or mistaken men," I replied. "It is not for me to define or limit how far such practices were expedient under their laws, and the circumstances of their society. It is enough for us that here, and in this age, the marriage rela- tion is thereby degraded, and the happiness of thousands unrelentingly sacrificed. What sensations must, the be- trothal of a child to a man old enough to be her father excite I How can she ever regard him with thpse feelings of affection which are indispensably necessary to render the marriage state one of happiness?" "She can at least be obedient." "Seriously and candidly, Mrs. Inkley," I replied, "can you find it in your heart to approve of these things? If you had a young and beautiful daughter, would not all the better feelings of your nature revolt against her forming such an unnatural connection? Could you in silence behold the sacrifice of all her prospects of happiness, and know u/nd feel that nothing in this wide world was left for her but obedience to the caprices and whims of a tyrant?"

"Yet the Scriptures require obedience in the wife, you know, and make the husband stand in the same relation to her that Christ does to the church." "And again I must say that how far such passages are to be received in an unqualified sense, I shall not pretend to decide, but that they were ever meant to compel any woman, immortal and accountable, under any circumstances what- ever, to submit to polygamy, and practices so detestable as these 'sealings,' I. venture to discredit." "And so do I," said Martha Inkley, who had entered the room unnoticed, and seemed glad of an opportunity to disa- gree with her rival, "These 'sealings' of children are-I will not say what." She had caught the expression of her husband's eye, but it could not silence her.' There was brother Haywood's daughter," she continued, "a beautiful little girl, in short skirts and pantalets, who came into the room, to be sealed to a man four times her age, while crying for her doll and baby things; and when the new-made husband attempted to embrace her, she fled, screaming that he was big and ugly, and she did not like him. Is it likely that, as years advance, she will grow fonder of him, or more reconciled to her lot?" "An extreme case," said Inkley, blandly. "Not exactly an extreme case, either," replied Martha.

How she shrieked, and screamed, and protested against it, declaring that if she couldn't have Frederick Barnes, her youthful playmate, she wouldn't be married at all 1"V "But she hadn't arrived at the years of discretion," said the husband. "'Years of discretion or not, it was a shame and an abomination to force her into such a connection 1" I thought as much.           I  "Why,' continued Martha, "a man will marry two or three sisters, as brother Warner did. He married one, and then, to please his wife, he took her sister, and, finally, the mother of both, and they all had children by him. I asked sister Warner what relationship the children held to each other. She only laughed." During our conversation, the people were gathering for the afternoon service. Their singular appearance attracted my attention. One man passed along with his six wives, three on either side of him, lovingly locking arms. An- other company passed, the man ahead, and his four wives following in single file. There was no established rule ,or fashion, but all were at perfect liberty to walk single, double, or treble, as suited them best. Suddenly, my atten- tion was arrested by. a female walking alone, and without any apparent - connection with the passing crowd. She looked towards the window where I sat, and I had a very distinct view of her features. She was beautiful, though somewhat faded.   SEARCH FOR MSS SCOTT.       213 "That lady-who is she?"I asked, addressing Mrs. Inkley. "What her name may now be, I cannot say," she replied. "Her maiden name was Scott." "Miss Scott I I have known her. Where does she live?" "I cannot say. I know nothing about her, though I have heard that-that"      i "That what?" "That she had been the mistress of a soldier who had deserted her, and that now she was picking up a living as she best could." The remembrance of her father's anxiety, and my pro- mise to him, flashed into my mind. "I must see her," I said, seizing my hat. "You have just seen her," said Sarah, laughing. "But I wish to talk with her." The women glanced at each other. "I was- acquainted with 'her father," I said. "He was very anxious about her." "That was perfectly natural," said Sarah, with some- thing like a sneer. I said no more, but walked out'at the door. Miss Scott, however, was nowhere to be seen. I walked up one street and down another,.all to no purpose. Inquir- ing would have been useless, and I thought that possibly she might have gone to the Tabernacle. So thither I went, but the immense concourse, even greater than that in the- forenoon, effectually precluded individual recognition, and I was glad to get away long before-the service closed.  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC8190-00000109"/> *1;%4  *   Tzz      htR Dr ST.

"Oh, I pity you," says one, " shut up in the seclusion of the Great Basin for three long months"  But my goodlfriend, there is no occasion for your pity ;  my time has passed pleasantly, I might say happily. I have found, and I trust made, friends. Long ago I learned that if only one spot of sunshine appeared, to monopolize it ; if. only one flower grew in my path, to be sure and notice that; to scrutinize ugJy faces for the one handsome feature, and to look for Something cheer-  j ing in all dismal prospects. I confess that sometimes my resolution has almost vanished, and that while looking at the Mormons my faith in human nature has been sorely tested. I have grown weary of describing unpleasant scenes. I would much rather write of virtues than'vices ; of good, and pure, and honest men, than wicked and dibhonest ones. Byron said that he described 'men as they were, not   MORMON MRACLES.         215 as -they should be, and that nothing in his descriptions or characters had ever equalled the reality. In the propagation of a new faith it usually happens that dreams, visions, miracles, and supernatural appearances and occurrences are the stock in trade. It is comparatively much easier to influence the imagination than convince the judgment, hence credulity rather than reason is addressed. The Mormons will tell you of great cures wrought by their priests. They will tell you of instances where the sick have recovered beneath their magic touchy they will point out on the necks and limbs of their children the scars of great sores that have been healed ; they will tell you of the blind having recovered their eye-sight, and the deaf their hearing. . Shall we -dispute that such things sometimes occur after the recent experiments in electro-magnetism, especially when we consider the powerful influence of imagi- nation over a certain class of diseases. The question arises, are the priests impostors, or are they the dupes of their own credulity? I am inclined to think the latter. Few of them  have any knowledge of the natural sciences, or the philosophy that traces effects to their cause. "-There can be nothing superna tnral," I remarked, to Mr. Inkly. "Your people should be too enlightened to believe in miracles, in the general acceptation of that term."    X.

"And yet, you must know that had not your churchb  inculcated the belief that miracles were of common occur- rence eighteen centuries ago, the Mormons in this age would  never have dreamed of promulgating such an idea. But  the possibility of supernatural events being granted, the cavil all rests on a question of time, which is nothing. (.) In conclusion, Mr. Inkley invited me to attend with him a meeting of the Council of Health, at Social Hall. To my  'j inquiries, if I would not be considered in the light of an intruder, he replied in the negative, and said that the sisters  were always pleased with the attendance of gentlemen,   X particularly strangers, for whom a seat was left empty.  "Is it then a meeting of the sisters?"I asked.  "Certainly."  "Then you have your strong-minded women here. I thought that class peculiar to the North." "' With this slight difference, your strong-minded females ar generally old maids, in whose bosoms the milk of human kindness has become sour, whereas our are-are"      . "Married women," I suggested, " whose lives are embit - tered by the neglect and indifference of their husbands; a  fate to which that of the old maid is ten times prefer-.  able." I found, on further inquiry, that the sisters assembled at this meeting to talk over their various aches and complaints, and discuss the most approved methods of cure. All phy- sicians are entitled to a seat among them, with a voice iu   THE COUNCOIL OF IIMATLTH.     217  their deliberations; so are the priests and elders, while strangers are admitted to see and be seen. We went early and obtained good seats., At least sixty-five females were in attendance, who, so far as I could discover, presented nothing remarkable in appearance. They looked exactly like any other promiscuous gathering of women, old and young, gay and sad, pretty and ugly; coarse and vulgar in some cases, but intelligent and refined in others. The meeting was called to order by Dr. High, who made some appropriate remarks on the blessings of health, and the violation of physical laws, to which all diseases must be attributed. He was followed by Dr. Speight, who begged leave to dissent from his worthy brother in many important particu-. lars. It was very plain to him that sickness was often superinduced by a direct interposition of Divine Providence. Pestilence fell on the Israelites as a judgment from Heaven, because of the sin of David; Job was smitten with a hor- rible disease to try his faith, and even in our own age, he contended, that similar events had happened, and might happen again. It was easy to'see that the last speaker was a particular favorite with the sisters, especially-those whose countenance, appearance, and manner indicated the lower class of igno- rance. The female mind is naturally prone to superstition in its uncultivated state. Sister Newman, one of this stripe, was evidently aching to get the floor. She manifest- ed great uneasiness, wringing, twisting, and rocking to and   &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC8190-00000111"/> 218      THE HUSSAND IN -UTAH.  fro. The moment he sat down she bounded up, and began   - a tirade against such infidel teachers as Dr. High. She knowed, indeed she did, that sickness went just there it  was sent-that God was pleased to afflict some peopeemore  than he did others, and that the best ones genal were most afflicted. "You know I am nearly always sick, but then I feel that it does me good, Last winter in that spell I had I could almost touch the hem of His garment" "Because I gave her so much opium," whispered Dr. High.  "Could touch the hem ofHEis garment," she continued,  "and that's just the way, when I am well, if the heavenly dew descends, I am, so much like a cake of tallow, that it rolls off and leaves no impression, but when I am sick, why  then, my dear friends, I am just like a muslin sheet, one drop wets me all over." The absurdity of these comparisons excited a slight titter  at her expense, when she dropped spitefully into her seat, and sister Harris arose. She was a little vulgar-looking woman, with a countenance expressive of dissipation and sensuality, and her speech was a strange compound of superstition and absurdity. She commenced by expressing  her belief that the devil-was let loose, and that Mormon  women were the especial objects of his wrath and hatred.  i, This she declared to be all wrong-said that they ought not  to be subject to pain in any case, but that disease and even  death, must be banished from among them, and go to the :-4 :   I      Gentiles to whom they belonged-that God was about to glorify his name by cutting off the rotten nations of the earth, when all would be Mormons, and in a state of felicity somewhat resembling the derizens of Mohammed's Paradise. She was succeeded by sister Lippincott, who seemed to think that all their difficulties and troubles were occasioned by their not loving their husbands enough, and being as obedient to them as they ought. It was a rambling tirade, and as often happens at female meetings, those least capable of speaking monopolized the floor. She concluded by re- commending catnip tea as a remedy in certain complaints, at which sister Gibbs started up, declaring that catnip tea was good for nothing, but that enough lobelia would drive all the devils out. The quantity necessary to perform this wonder she did not prescribe. At length she began jump- ing up and down, clapping her hands, and crying out, "The spirit is upon me, the spirit is upon me, even now as it des- cended on the Apostles at the day of Pentecost." Then she broke forth into a strain that they called speaking in an unknown tongue. She was certainly phrenzied- or intoxi- cated. I am inclined to think the latter. Her language and gestures were actually indescribable, but soon ended in complete exhaustion, when she fell to the floor. The sisters crowded around her, raised her up, and laid her at full length on one of the seats. One of the elders then arose and attempted to interpret what she said, but the noise and confusion had become so great that it was impossible for me to hear what he said.   &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC8190-00000112"/> 220       THE B ufStAND IN TUTAH. Inkley, who seemed amazed, and I fancied felt disgusted at the scene, proposed to go away. Several of the more re- spectable and intelligent women actually departed. I wished. however, to see the end. The inspired sister soon fell asleep and order was restored. Sister Sanders then arose, and expressed her firm belief that all diseases, acute 'br chronic might be cured by the exercise of faith and the laying on of hands, and; dealt largely in her own miraculous powers. She cofild ease the most violent toothache, she said, by simply rubbing her hands over the part affected, and com- manding the pain to depart. She could stop hemorrhages of the most extravagant character, and last, though byr no means least, a word from her would restore a dislocated joint, or mend a broken bone. Her sister's arm had been badly injured by some unlucky accident, and she roundly asserted that it had been instantaneously recovered by the exercise of her power. One woman had a daughter present who was afflicted with some cutaneous disease, and who9 desired to have the remedy applied. The sisters, with the priests and elders, crowded-around her, laid their hands on her beadand person, when one of the most eminent was moved to bless her in an unknown tongue.  The oracular utterances were interpreted to mean the invocation of great blessings, both temporal and spiritual; she was .to possess all necessary good, all that the heart or sense could desire; her seed was to-outnumber the stars, and thence kings and priests-were to arise. She looked, however, as if some guarantee for the comforts and necessaries of life would be     AN A) TTWG PrATY.       .221 much more acceptable. She was scarcely sixteen, and yet had been married for some time. One child held to her clothes, another was in her lap, and there was evidently the prospect of a third. There were unmistakable, indications of poverty in her general appearance. She was poorly clad, and, I doubt not, ill-fed. After this -others came forward; some had aches in one part, others had pains in another. One was bruised, ano- ther wounded, a third was sick, a fourth had the fever; in short, I was strongly reminded of an excellent old lady, who was great for visiting among her neighbors, and whose enumeration of the complaints incident to her family was summed up in the following amusing style : "Jemmy has a boil on his hip, and Jerry a cut on his leg; my husband is very poorly, and so - much ails me that I really don't know what to complain of." . It really seemed that there was not a sound person in the community, at least in the house. All were full to overflowing of the troubles and afflictions which had befallen -their neighbors or themselves. Yet this trait of humanity is not peculiar to the Mormons. For a grievous list of ailments and sicknesses, commend me at any time to a party of -old women in the lower classes of life. I was, once greatly amused by a woman of ordinary intelligence, who, according to her phraseology, " never saw a well day," who always kept a dish of "systic," or some other, kind of herb tea in the corner, and who was exceedingly angry if the physician did not call at least V I   &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC8190-00000113"/> 222      THE' HUSBAND IN UTAH. twice a week to inquire after her health, though he could never find her at home. This interesting part of the business being finished, it was proposed to adjourn. Sister Petit, however, objected, as she had a remarkable vision to narrate.   This was neither more nor less than a tremendous conflict between the Lord and the devil, which closely resembled in its minute particulars the famous fight between Apollyon and Christian, recorded by Bunyan, in the Pilgrim's Progress. For a long time the battle raged with equal spirit on both sides, but the Lord triumphed in the end, and his sooty majesty was driven away. There was much more of similar absurdity. In review of these things, we find ourselves involuntarily asking how it could be possible for a system of religious faith, like Mormonism, to arise and flourish as that has done, unless some equally superstitious tendencies of education were at work on the public mind? Looking-at :Mormonism philosophically, we Ill find little in it that is original. It is an offshoot of Judaism, with a little borrowed from-Christianity to make it palatable to the present age. Thus, if you deprecate to a Mormon the idea of paying tithes, he will refer you at once to Abraham, who gave tithes of all he possessed to Melchisedek. If you com- plain of polygamy, he will tell you of Jacob, and David, and Solomon, and thus to the end of the chapter. Think you if priestcraft had not so flourished in other countries, it ever would have abounded as it does in Utah? It is not, difficult for a believer in spirits to believe in the spirit rappings.  f   ad s OF OM  ISION.       223 Yet it argues little for the progress of the age that this spurious and 'prurient birth should belong to the afternoon of the nineteenth century. We might have hoped and looked for better things. Is it not significant of an unpa- latable truth? Does it not prove conclusively that the advancement in moral and religious ideas has not kept pace with that of the physical sciences; that, notwithstanding railroads, steamboats, and telegraphs, we are yet hanging to the skirts of the past, fettered by its superstitions, and imitating its vices. Let no one think that I am attempting to excuse or palliate the vices of the Mormons. I quarrel with no man's creed except so far as it tends to make him vicious and dan- gerous to the community. Many things are simply absurd, and an assembly of old women, like those attending the Council of Health, could scarcely have deserved a passing notice, only as tending to show how human hearts, even in this enlightened age, may be darkened by superstition. In any other view, it was probably one of the most harmless assemblages thant ever convened in Utah. But there are things for which we must and do blame the Mormons, more even than for polygamy and kindred vices. Great as may be their sins of commission, those of omission are certainly greater. They will meet you on all sides with Scripture quotations, and bring the examples of patriarchs and prophets to sanction their adoption of old customs and ancient usages, but it is only on the side which tends to blacken and deform humanity. .

Their honesty, their truth, their moral integrity their unflinching adherence to the right, is made of little or no account; but the one fault into which they were betrayed by the age, or the circumstances in which they lived, oh I that is something to copy and applaud. We must blame the Mormons for reading our Bible as they do. You cannot open this book without finding on its eldest or newest leaves the purest and holiest lessons of truth and virtue, given in words that burn after the lapse of ages, yet all this they pass over with neglect and indifference. We blame them that they have retarded the progress of the age, and blackened the development of great and good ideasi ae womb of time. The world, mankind, the nine- teenth century all demanded a teacher not to instruct them in the doctrines of a new faith, but to diffuse vitality into the old. They demanded a knowledge of the Infinite God of the real man, not the fabulous, of actual divine Scrip- tures, not pregnant with dead forms and meaningless cere- monies, but filled with love, charity, and good-will to men. They wanted a live religion that should manifest itself in all the daily walk and conversation, as well on the broad high- way of letters, business, science, politics, or morals, as in the quiet seclusion of the cloister or the domestic shade. They asked a leader in a great religious movement, a pro- gressive enterprise. All things betoken this. Never before has the world witnessed such a grand conflict between the powers of light and darkness, between science and igno. i.*   FALSIrY OF THE MORMON SYSTEM.     225 rance, between the crumbling systems of the past, and- the rising phcenii of the present. We must blame the Mormons for rising up at such a time to deceive mankind with an egregious system of folly that copies the past in its vices, and looks for its future to the worst passions of men. We ( must blame them, that with such opportunities for doing good, they failed to do it, that in such a vast field of culture they only planted the old, dry, unprofitable weeds, which civilization and Christianity bad thrown away as vile and noxious, though superstition and barbarism had preserved the seeds. What if their followers are the poor, the lowly, even the stupidly ignorant, or the vile. Publicans and sinners were the companions of our Lord at table; it was to babes in knowledge that the glorious tidings of the Gospel were revealed. Does it not show a remissness in our churches that these weak ones, whose souls, however, are as precious; and whose happiness is as much worth caring for, as that of the monarch on his throne-that these weak ones, I say, should be left to herd with impostors, and swell the number of their dupes. Does it not prove that Christianity is no longer the glad tidings of great joy to all people, but rather to the rich and great. 7  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC8190-00000115"/> 226.      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. CHAPTER XIII.    I REMOVAL-M-m  NEW LANDLADY--MSS SCOTT, ETC. 'R. INKLEY came to my room    one morning before I Jl  had arisen. .There had never been any lock to the door, and entrance wag readily effected. Greatly surprised, I bade him "Good morning," while he seated himself with   equal composure on the side of the bed. "Your sojourn with me has been pleasant, sir, very plea- sant," he began. "I have striven to make it so. I believe I have succeeded.'" "Yes," I   replied, in rather a stereotyped phrase. "I have been quite as happy as could be expected." "And more so," he answered. "You could not certainly have expected to find such friends as you' have found. Haven't I   administered to your comfort in every way? Haven't I   gratified your curiosity, even at the expense of disgracing the church of which I am a leader? And this room-what a beautiful room it is-so apt and fit for lodg- ing."   FAMTrY PEACE!        22T I replied that the apartment was quite satisfactory. "Then you will feel regret at leaving us, if only on that account." "Leave you, when? I had not thought of leaving you till I left the country," I said, with some surprise, " unless, indeed, you desired it." "I have not desired it, no sir, not I; but a husband, though, presumed by the law of the States to be one with wife, is rather overshadowed when the number expands to three or four. Family peace, sir, is a great thing-a very great thing ; a man must make sacrifices to secure that- sacrifices, too, that are sometimes very trying to his feel- ings." "Am I then to understand, sir, that your wives desire my departure?" "Exactly so, sir; at least Sarah does." "In what- have I been so unfortunate as to offend that lady?" "Women- are captious, sir--very captious, capricious, and. whimsical, of course you know that. Domestic peace, sir, is a great thing. Sorry that it is so, but can't help it; spoiled children must be humored." "I understand ; if my presence has become obnoxious to Mrs. Inkley, I can only express sorrow for the fact, without the least idea of the cause." "Nothing, sir, just nothing. I believe it all originated in that conversation the other day, in which you rather favored the opinion of Martha."   .  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC8190-00000116"/> '228      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. "But Mrs. Inkley certainly cannot blame a man for the free expression of his opinions." "Oh, she don't know herself. She's whimsical, that's all --but domestic peace " Yes, domestic peace, and the idea -that even my absence would secure that in a family with three wives, had some- thing in it strangely in contrast with the nature of things. I was not disposed, however, to make ill-natured remarks, especially as he offered me a letter of introduction to Mrs. Farrow, an amiable Mormon lady, who lived at the eastern end of the city. After breakfast I started out, soon made my way to that part -of the town, found the good woman, presented my letter, and was well received. I was much pleased with the situation of her adobe cottage, and her own mild, intelli- gent countenance, and we soon struck a bargain. I removed thither immediately, and was accommodated with an agree- able, well-ventilated chamber, the windows of which looked out on some grounds, well laid out, and planted with beau- tiful flowers, native and exotic. The prospect is extensive, and stretches away on the south to a great distance ; north and east the mountains appear, through which the emigrant trains find their way into the valley. Mountains likewise appear on the western side; their summits tipped with snow the greater part of the year. Antelope Island, in the Salt Lake, is distinctly visible, though at a distance of twenty- two miles. Thus, the sublime and the beautiful of nature are wonderfully and harmoniously blended.   MSS?SNOW, THE POETESS.      229 Mrs. Farrow was an .active, kind, and lady-like New Englander; a rigid Mormon on all points except polygamy, which she seemed to thoroughly detest. She held a promi- nent position in society, and her house was the frequent resort of visitors. Amongsthese Eliza Snow shone conspicu- ously. She is a pale, mild-eyed, silly-looking girl, though she aspires to poetic honors, and many of her productions ,have received the unqualified approbation of the immaculate Mormon leader ;i yet, considered as literary efforts, they are beneath criticism. Her conversation is not more delectable than her poetry,. and for conceited egotism was really unmatch able. "I am not appreciated here," she said. "I cannot asso- ciate with kindred spirits; there is no one to sympathize with my feelings. I must have a field of labor. I must go where I can spread myself." This she repeated several times, to my infinite amusement, while Mrs. Farrow's fat sides fairly shook with suppressed laughter. Miss Snow, however, did not seem in the least offended, and her exces- sive vanity is rendered pardonable by her great good nature. She came one day, and brought a poem in manuscript, from 'which she read extracts for our entertainment. There were words without ideas, and ideas struggling through a redun- dancy of words; figures, metaphors, and similes without order or arrangement. When she finished, not a word was spoken, though she evidently expected the homage of flat- tery. The sincerest 'admirers of good -poetry are always most deeply disgusted with bad, and I really had the imper  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC8190-00000117"/> 230      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. tinence, on a subsequent occasion, to say that young damsels could be much better employed in household labors than in stringing together unmeaning rhyme, The poetess looked at her white and dimpled hand, which she boastingly asserted had never been soiled by dish-water. Her father is a man of considerable property, and the brother of Judge Snow, mentioned in a former part of this work. He evidently desires to make a fine lady of his daughter, and for that end has had her taught certain accomplishments, which here seem rather out of place. Mrs. Farrow grows facetious over the fact of her continual visiting here, and the repeated invitations I receive to dine at her father's house. This gentleman, who bears the title of elder, called on me one day with his daughter. He was a little bustling man, with an affected consequential air. We conversed for some time on general topics, when sud- denly, and without any preamble or apparent confusion, he introduced the subject of his business by making some inqui- ries regarding mine. "You design to stay some time in our country?" he said, inquiringly. "That depends on circumstances." "How would you like to make it your permanent resi- dence?' I wished to be guarded, and returned an equivocal answer "It is a very fine country; great- chances for men of enterprise and talent. Large families can be supported with ease.1"   ANGLING FOR A HUSBAND.       231 "But I have no family." 'I suppose not, just now, but will have probably." "Rather doubtful." "I should think otherwise. You must be in pursuit of a wife, what else could have brought you here?" The idea of going to Salt Lake city for a wife was deci- dedly, new, and excited a broad smile. The young lady tossed her head, tried to blush, and simpered, "Oh, papa!" "Yes," he continued. "I've hit the nail on the head- that must be it. Very well, it's all right. There must be marrying and giving in marriage till the day when we become like the angels." "I am afraid there is no such good luck in store for me." "Afraid I why man, how silly you be. ' The finest belles in Utah would consider themselves honored by your prefer- ence. Just try." I shook my head. "I know it; ask my daughter there, she has a strong predilection for Gentiles." Again came the shrug and the simper, "Oh, papa!" "I declare ishe has," he continued with a loud laugh, "she told me so herself." Here the young lady really blushed in earnest, and I was half tempted to kick the old fellow out of the room. "But you don't permit your girls to marry among the Gentiles, do you?" He twisted his mouth and features into the most ludicrous and extraordinary grimace imaginable, as much as to say  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC8190-00000118"/> 232 ^    --- THEu  sAJUD I N UTA M  what a great spoony you must be to take professions for more than they intend. "It is contrary to the rules of our church," he said, pre-  sently, "but girls will be headstrong, and parents easy, sometimes'; indeed I know of fathers, and mothers, too, as to that matter, who would rejoice to give their daughters to Gentile husbands, provided, in all cases, that their personal connivance to the affair could be kept concealed." "I thought that according to your creed a Mormon hus- band was essential to the salvation of the wife." "Yes,- according to our creed, and there are many things in the creeds of certain sectaries, which in their hearts they know to be false. At any rate, speaking for myself, I would risk that for my daughter, if she could thereby obtain an advantageous settlement for life." He spoke seriously, and with great deliberation. "Are t fire no such chances for a young and beautiful woman, among the people of your church?"I inquired, doubtingly. He scanned my countenance with an eager yet curious expression, and said: "What Hwant for my daughter, and what some other parents wish for their daughters, is a home, and a true, faithful, loving heart, solely and unquestionably hers-that will bear with her weaknesses, and strengthen her virtues.

One of our neighbors, a great burly Briton, with seven wives, is a candidate for Eliza's hand, and Brother Brigham recommends the match., But she lhates and despises him, and we cannot find it in our hearts to force her inclinations. And yet, according to our creed, disobedience to-:the prophet is a mortal sin." All this was said with a smiling countenance and affected good nature, yet it was easy to see how deeply the parent's heart was touched. "Is your daughter's suitor a man-of property and intelli- gence?"I inquired. "He is not," replied the unhappy father. 'a Last winter his family were in a state actually bordering on starvation. He will not work at his trade, which he pretends is degrad- ing, and his only ostensible means of livelihood is that of a comic actor at the theatre. I could not describe the huts in which his wives are kept, and though on the boards he is all fun, frolic, mirth and glee, his private life is whispered to be quite another thing. And now, to come to the point, could not you prevent the marriage between him and my daughter ever taking place." I was surprised beyond measure, and the young lady arose and left the room. "I prevent the marriage I how, pray?"   &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC8190-00000119"/> 234       THE HUSBAND IN UTAH,. "'By marrying her yourself. I speak plain, necessity impels it." "Sir, I could not do that," I replied. "I respect the lady, but never thought of her as a wife; you may com- mand my services in any way that will not compromise-my personal freedom and honor."          4 I really sympathized with the father, who seemed' pained and disappointed. "I fear then, that my poor girl must go to the altar of sacrifice," he said, "Persecution will be -brought to bear upon us, and ultimately we shall be forced to yield." "Has she no relations to whom you could send her?" "She has relatives to be sure, but how could she ever reach them? I could not think of exposing her to the diffi- culties and dangers of such a journey." "You are an elder in this Church"I said, " why not have its iniquitous practices and Ows abolished?" "They are too deeply interwen in our social system," he replied ; " too many are interested in perpetuating them; polygamy, like slavery, may be regarded as an evil by the very ones who practise it. Then, too, the real power of the church, all exists in its acknowledged head. The elder comparatively is little more than the meanest member." "But, sir, you must have sensible and honest men among you, who once convinced that polygamy is an evil, would unite their energies to extirpate it. Whether or not they regarded it- objectionable as husbands, if appealed to as fathers, their hearts would respond."'   EX(CANGE OF GIFTS.        235 He shook his head doubtingly. "You have sensible and honest men in the South, who question the policy,- justice, and humanity of the peculiar institution which flourishes there, yet who are utterly impo- tent to remove it." After some more desultory conversation, the elder took his leave, his daughter having previously gone, when curio- sity led me to make some inquiries of Mrs. Farrow. She informed me that Elder Snow had six wives, who resided together in one large house-that Eliza was the daughter of his first wife, a woman of some intelligence who evidently abhorred polygamy, and whose matronly instruc- tions had not fallen on barren ground. She laughed heartily at the elder's absurd proposal, and said she had been expect- ing it, though she gave little credit to his expressions of paternal feelings, and declared that other and sinister motives were at work in his mind. "Mormon fathers," she continued, "make no scruple of offering the hands of their daughters to marriageable men, and when the girls are beautiful or wealthy, they always require a consideration. They are not yet so lost to all feel- ings of shame or decency as to call it by its proper name, a boana fide sale."  "What, then, do they call it?" "Oh, an exchange of gifts,-or the son makes a present to his new-father, or lends some. valuable -article or animal to him, with the understanding that it shall not be reclaim- ed."  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC8190-00000120"/> 236      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH.             3 "Do you think sisuik things right or honorable?"    i "No;" she replied with emphasis.             i "Yet they are distinctive features of your Church." "I know that very well, I know that doctrine was prop-  X agated as a Revelation from Heaven, by the immaculate    I Joseph, yet I can tell how, in my opinion, the prophet was deceived." "I should like to hear."     -  "Why, Satan came to him in the form of an angel, and   i not being sufficiently fortified by faith and prayer, he was not able to detect the cheat, but received the devil's in- structions regarding polygamy, and kindred customs, as the veritable truth." "Well, that is saddling more on the Prince of Darkness thfan I should think him guilty of. There is no worse devil than a wicked man." Mrs. Farrow, however, said that she was careful not to talk loud, as she should hardly feel safe if the elders knew of her heresy. "Yet you do not suppose that they would injure you?" "No, but they would probably expel me from the church with a curse, and then I should be overtaken by all sorts of calamities." "None the more for that you wouldn't," I said. "Oh, but I should," she replied, 1"I well know that. One man whom tkey cursed and expelled from the church, was struck by lightning the very next day. Another was bit by a serpent, swelled and died in the greatest agony,  '    A   '    '   MRS.

"But, Mrs. Farrow," I said, "all this is superstition. Such accidents always occur in the regular course of nature. The lightning strikes indiscriminately, the serpent bites an intruder, and insanity comes as the result of disease or the violation of a physical law, but in no case can it be super- induced as the result of such agencies as you suppose." The worthy dame, however, persisted that one fact was better than a thousand theories, that she had experienced in her own person the potent influences of the blessing of the church, and that nothing should induce her to try the experiment of daring its curse. Of course I was silenced, though not conquered. Notwithstanding her superstitious motives, Mrs. Farrow was a woman of decided intelligence, shrewd, ingenious, and keen as a brier in driving a bargain, when opposed to a wealthy or speculating character, though no one- would more readily melt at a tale of woe, or respond with more heartiness to calls of clcharity. She kept a small shop or variety store, which was tended by one of her daughters, and was altogether a profitable concern. The sale of ready made. clothing was not, perhaps, the least thriving branch of her trade, and the assistance it enabled her to give poor women, wfs one of its most satisfactory results.  She bought grain, flour, pork, beef, anything eatable, which she retailed in small quantities, to such housekeepers as worked  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC8190-00000121"/> 238      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. for her, or if they preferred money, it was readily given. It was not in her nature to grind the poor for the increase of riches, and many a blessing have I heard invoked on her head, by the miserable recipients of her kindness and charity. One day, while sitting- in her snug little parlor, which was a model of neatness and comfort, I caught the glimpse of a woman just entering the store. It was but a glimpse, yet something in her carriage and appearance forcibly re- minded me of Miss Scott. The door between the two apartments being partly open, I could hear the plaintive tones of a melodious voice, without being able to distinguish the words. When she retired, I observed that she carried with her a small bundle, probably of sewing, and a basket that contained something covered by a paper. Mrs. Farrow soon came into the parlor; and her eyes were red, as if with recent tears. I was reading a novel, which observing, she remarked, with a sad smile, "How many scenes in real life exceed in misery and despair the most high-wrought crea-i tions of fancy." "And yet," I answered; "misery of that description is mostly self-made." "So much the worse for the sufferer; for then to his or her other tortures are added those of remorse. A young woman just left me, whose whole appearance was so indica- tive of sorrow and destitution, that without asking her name or requiring a reference, as usual, I gave her' the work she desired, and added thereto a small quantity of provisions O i   OLEARING UP X1  OHXRAOTEB.     239 Poor thing I her expressions of gratitude really overcame me"      , "Then you did not know her?" "I did not.? "I wish you had." "Why?" "Because I half suspect that she is a girl in whom I am deeply interested." A blank look of amazement settled on the countenance of the worthy dame. "Oh, I hope not, indeed, I really hope not," she re- plied. "Can you tell me where she lives?" "I cannot," she answered, gravely. "But why should you wish to know?    . I had sunk immeasurably in her opinion, and deemed it necessary to exculpate myself from the rumor the unworthy suspicion aroused in her mind. So, without further parley, I related all that I knew about Miss Scott, with her father's deep anxiety, and the interest which, for his sake, I had taken in her fate. - Mrs. Farrow listened attentively, and when I had finished, expressed her conviction that Miss Scott and the person with whom she so deeply sympathized were identical. She would make further inquiries, she said, and if the supposi- tion proved correct, we would take measures for restoring her to her father. I was not kept long in suspense. The next day she  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC8190-00000122"/> 240       THE HrSBBA  IN UTAH. returned with the work, and Mrs. Farrow at once intro- duced- the subject, by inquiring if her name was Scott. She replied, with some little hesitation, that it was. "And you came hither in an emigrant train for Califor- nia?" continued the matron. Her auditor assented. "And would you,be willing to return to your father should an opportunity present?" "But would it be possible for my father to forgive and receive me?" she said, bursting into a passion of tears. Mrs. Farrow assured her that there could be no doubt of it, and concluded by recommending her departure in the first emigrant train, declaring that she would supply the funds for all necessary expenses. Miss Scott expressed her readiness to go, and gave a general outline history of her trials in Mormondom. She had never ceased to regret the first false step in her life - her carelessness and neglect of parental teaching and advice. Disobedience, she said, led her to form an acquaint- ance, and ultimately a more intimate connection with the young lieutenant. Disobedience led her to fly .with him from her best and truest friend, and then, as the meed of her folly, she had met shame, desertion, and disgrace. Before she had lived a month with Fitzgerald, her seducer, he became weary of her, left hber for days, and even weeks, without fuel or food, at which times she would be obliged to go out and beg a scanty supply from her neighbors. These generally were most ungracious, and never failed to express   mtSS SCOTT'S MrERING8.       241 their abhorrence of her degraded condition; for, strange as it may appear, the sixth wife of a. Mormon holds in supreme contempt the unfortunate female who may become a mother without the sacred name of wife, or one whose connection with a lover has not been sanctioned by the marriage tie. 'She could have borne all this, she said, as a merited punishment, but the Mormon libertines taking advantage of her unprotected condition, began to insult her with disgust- ing proposals, of which even Fitzgerald urged her accept- ance.

But Miss Scott had other difficulties. The husbands in whose families she found employment, almost invariably solicited her to become a member of their seraglios, and sometimes she found it extremely difficult to escape their- importunities. For this she had been persecuted in various ways, and it was extremely difficult for her to supply herself with bread.

Sauntering along the streets, I came to a beautiful garden, the property of a man by the name of Sayres. His wife is a rigid Mormon, though he denounces the whole system as an abomination. He came here to gratify her absurd notions, and, for the sake of family peace, tolerates her ridiculous absurdities.- Garden- ing is his ruling passion. He is an extravagant lover of flowers, and many a floral curiosity has he found in this. region. He contemplates making a collection of all the plants native to the Basin, which will be a valuable addition to botany. A large plot of ground is thus most tastefully arranged, and clumps of beautiful and ornamental shade trees, stationed at regular intervals, with garden-chairs and benches for the accommodation of visitors. Several ladies, some bright little girls,.and two or three of the elders, were promenading the walks. One of them came up, and -cour- teously addressed me. He seemed an agreeable man, and we soon entered into conversation. He was decidedly intel- ligent, and appeared to anticipate all the objections that could be raised against the peculiarities of their social sys- tem.  He seemed candid, sincere, and tolerant, though whether with reality or not I cannot pretend to say. In reply to some remarks of his, I said- that it seemed to me that the elders and leaders of the church were permitted to exercise a permanent influence upon the character of the people, through their legislative and social power; and that such influence could scarcely fail to be undemocratic, unjust,   CONVERSATION WITH A MORMON ELDER.     245. and unsuitable to the jurisdiction and general principles of the federal government, though not unpardonable, and pro- bably not incapable of salutary change. "It must be evident to the most casual observer, that the exercise of power by one part of the people over the remain- der will affect unfavorably the character of the whole," I continued, "and the more readily the poorer and weaker class submit to the tyranny of the richer and mightier, the greater will be the injury to their true interests, and the dIeeper their moral and political degradation."  He replied, with perfect good humor, by referring to dif- ferences in opinions, feelings, and sentiments, and expressed his firm belief that polygamy had been, and would be, a great blessing to both male and female, individually and socially, though, if I understood him rightly, the advantages were prospective rather than otherwise, after all. He said that polygamy would be much more salutary and effective than law, public-opinion, and religion, or all combined, to eradicate certain evils, which always had, and always would flourish under a system of monogamy, to say nothing of the fearful diseases and such crimes as infanticide, which almost invariably- attend illicit connections, though rarely if ever occurring under a' system of marriage so extensive and complicated as that of the Mormons. "Your Eastern cities," he said, "point the finger of scorn at us in their true pharisaic spirit, yet how well might - we retort by referring-to the courtesans that throng their streets, to the innocent infants, mutilated, drowned, or left  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC8190-00000125"/> 246       THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. to the tender mercies of strangers, that swell their criminal reports, of deaths occasioned by nameless hideous ways i all of which prove that in their midst is a vice stalking at noonday that their most stringent laws have no power to remove or obliterate. And of all these crimes we are clear, thank God l"(i.) "You mean that in name these crimes do not exist among you; in fact, they certainly do," I replied. "As how?    There is no such thing as concubinage, because all- are married; there can be no illegitimate chil- dren, because all are born in wedlock; mothers are never induced by shame or the sternness of public opinion, to sacrifice their offspring; how then can you say that the crimes which I have instanced as part of your system belong to ours?"U(j.) Our conversation was long, and his defense of polygamy sophistical and eloquent. Gradually I led -him on to speak of the future of his people-of their hopes and aspirations. Yet few Mormons are idealists. With the single excep; tion of the  Jews, no sectaries are more truly practical. Their sermons and conversations relate particularly to pros- perity in this world. Only a  part of the females, the stupidly ignorant, and the half-insane, are visionaries. The remainder are much more ambitious of honor and wealth in this world, than desirous of the treasure that neither moth nor rust can corrupt. The Mormon leaders, as a general things are cautious and discreet in the expression of their views or plans for the future. It is against their purpose   PROSPEOTS OF MORMONISM.       24? to excite suspicion, or arouse the jealousy of a government which they secretly hate. Only on extraordinary occasions they wax eloquent, and you can gather fromfrcautiously- worded phrases, a sufficient insight into the boldness and originality of their schemes. "Mormonism," said the elder, " has escaped the serpents that would have destroyed it in its cradle-the Protestant and the Catholic church. Great events which it will take centuries to ripen, are in embryo. The beginning of the end is at hand. The miserable intrigues and subterfuges that deny to us the right of self-government, cannot always be tamely endured. We have yearly accessions of wealth and strength, and shall soon be in a position to command respect before the nations of the world."  "Do the-Mormons, then, desire to establish an indepen- dent nation?"' I inquired, coming at once to the point. "Such may be their destiny in the nature of things. We have all the elements of a distinct nationality. Our country is peculiarly fitted for self-reliance and defense. The Great Basin, with its own system of lakes and rivers, its fertile soil, mild climate, and mineral productions; above all its central position on the great line of travel from east to west, from north to south,'could'easily support ,millions of people, whose mountain passes would be as capable of stern defence as Thermopylae, and whose warriors in the cause of freedom and religion might defy the world." "But will your people have the temerity to rebel against the Federal Government?"  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC8190-00000126"/> A48       THl HUSBAND IN UTAH. "-Nothing dan be further from their thoughts than rebel lion in the present- state of things, or while the Federal Government continues the liberal and enlightened policy which mostly distinguishes it; but secret agencies are at work, the seeds of revolution have been planted. In less than a century, two distinct and separate confederacies will arise, phoenix-like, from the ruins of your present government. Then it will remain for us, on the western border, to assert our rights, our ,dignity, and our independence, with a pros- pect of success."        ' "If you wait till then; it will be a long, a very long time," I said.  "But what matters that?" he continued. "We can afford to wait for great events, or the acquisition of some abounding good; and compared to- eternity, or the long . lapse of future ages, how a century dwindles into insignifi- cance I Yes," he continued, clasping his hands with fervor, "we can afford to wait for that which will surely come." "But suppose it ccmes not?"  "That were impossible from the very nature of things. The clouds have already gathered on the horizon, there is the deep mutter of the earthquake which precedes the shock, the hollow moan of the volcano that indicates an explosion. Look at your Congress, wasting their time in silly intrigues and worthless cabals, while the real business of the adminis- tration, and the true interests- of the people are neglected. And does not every year witness a further dereliction from duty, a more wasteful expenditure of, the public money, a   MAIFEST DESTINY.          249 more shameful and shameless disposition to discord, and the subjugation of public business to private animosity. As the states expand and the population increases, the nature of your government requires the increase of the representa- tives,in exact ratio. This accession of numbers will aug- ment rather than diminish the difficulty. It is idle to sup- pose that a country so vast, with such separate interests, and clashing institutions, can be held together by the bands of a government so complicated in its machinery, and so defective in all that constitutes the true muscle of adminis- trative power. Your laws are much better adapted to secure the happiness of a small state than consolidate the provinces of a Continent in one huge Empire." "And do you believe all this?"      "Most certainly I do, and your people believe it, too, however loth to confess the fact. Very few have faith in the perpetuity of your institutions. Some openly prophesy the rupture; others fear, yet deprecate the idea, but it has found a place in the minds of all." "That is certainly too much the case." "Manifest destiny has a meaning with us," he continued ;'The Mormon church has been denounced as a humbug, and compared with Millerism, and other sects of ephemeral existence, but such is not the case. It is not a sect, but a faith, and the only faith at present in the world, that has a future before it." "I do not understand you," I said. "I mean,"' he resmed, "that as past religious history II*  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC8190-00000127"/> 250'      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. belongs to the East, the future depends on the West. Christianity has had its day. It arose in Asia, passed stead- ily over Europe, and gained the Continent of America, reflecting in its passage some scattering rays over the northern parts of Africa. But the Catholic church can never be more powerful than it is.  Protestantism has reached its culminating point. Mohammedanism is without either prestige or power, and the future is ours." I smiled at his enthusiasm. "You think me an enthusiast; very well," he went on. "But great effects spring from little causes. We know that the Genoese navigator never dreamed of discovering a new world when he set sail for Cipango and, the distant regions of India. When the Apostle of Mecca explained his first Revelation to a jeering, hooting crowd, what stretch of imagination would have reached the vast empires to be sub- jugated in liis name. In the earliest days of Christianity, who would have thought it possible that the instrument of torture to a malefactor would become the symbol of rank and honors-that warriors would carry it on their standards, and kings on their bosoms. Yet Christianity progressed with slower steps than Mormonism has done; at the end of three years Mohammed had made one convert, and that one his wife;; Joseph Smith had as many thousand follow- ers in that length of time. Has the world ever witnessed a parallel to our success?" "Seldom, I believe." "Yet our mission is only begun, our destiny, instead-of Y,^   CONsscIOtrs scRMT.      251 being accomplished is only commenced. We have a vast interior and almost impregnable- country, stretching away to the north and the south, the east and the west; and all this country is to be filled up with people of one faith, actuated by the same designs and desires." "But you forget that this country is already inhabited and occupied." "By whom?" he inquired, with some surprise. "The natives, of course." "Oh, that is nothing," he replied with contempt. "The Indians are doomed to extirpation, or extermination. That is their future, quite as certain as the other is ours." "And the Mormons, you think, will remain peaceful members of our Confederacy until there comes -ageneral rupture between the North and the South." "Probably, if our social and domestic institutions are not meddled with-7-if we are not required to abolish polygamy, or the union of church and state; but under other circum- stances our allegiance would be doubtful." "Yet, what could you promise yourselves by rebellion against a plower so much stronger than yours?" "Not so much stronger, either, when all is considered. Our mountains and deserts would supply the place of for- tresses and armies, and our triumph would be secure because defeat would be impossible." "There might be something in that," I said, wishing by a seeming harmony in views to lead him on. "You, must'know, and your government must know, that  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC8190-00000128"/> "O       THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. our dependence on it is by a very precarious tenure.

We are necessary to them, not they  to us."                       ' "How will you make that appear?" "How will I make it appear?" he replied. "I should think it would be obvious to the most casual observer.

We ask nothing of it only to be left alone."         j There can be no doubt but that this man spoke the truth. The Mormons desire no affiliation with us, our faith, or   S social institutions; all they ask is to be left alone. It is the wish of their leaders, it is in the hearts of the people. You I will hear it verbally, and tacitly expressed in a thousand ways. "We can take care of ourselves," is their constant   I and oft-recurring sentiment-"We want nothing of them,"    I "Why do they follow us?"These, and similar expressions are common with all. In no country have I ever heard such frequent reference  I: made to spies. If a beggar comes to the door and solicits    charity, he is instantly suspected of being a py. If a t:i   ^      .8 A  B JK sU t  -FtlU TUJ&amp;B. A a r stranger passes along the streets he is supposedto be of the same character. Such constant suspicion argues to my mind anything but the consciousness of innocence, or the firm rectitude that never shrinks from observation. And you consider this country capable of supporting a dense population!"I said, addressing the Elder. "-I do not know- of one whose capabilities are greater," he replied, " or whose resources for undeveloped wealth are more vast and complicated. Extensive territories wait for men to come and possess them. A soil never broken by the plow only asks tillage and cultivation to rival the famous fertility of the East. Hidden ores and metals sleep uncared for in the bowels of the earth. We might supply the world with salt for centuries, without exhausting the abundance of that indispensable article. Our hills are richer in pasture than the famed and famous Land of Goshen. Think of the time when all these facilities for exhaustless wealth shall be in progress of development, when tele- graphs shall span our mountains, and railroads traverse the 'valleys, while every ship wings, to us from all quarters of the globe the glory and honor of the Gentiles, and the devotees of our faith pour out their treasures in offerings on its shrines."  Whether or not the Mormons are destined to occupy the distinguished position in the world to which they aspire, is at present, problematical. That stranger things have hap- pened, is undeniable; that weaker beginnings have astounded the world with mighty results is equally certain, and no one  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC8190-00000129"/> 254      THE HUSBAND IN uITA. who has sufficiently examined their prospects and character, will be surprised if long before the vexed question of slavery is laid aside, another should arise in connection with them quite as intricate and complicated. It seems to me that few have looked on them or their creed in the philosophical light they deserve. The one is considered a humbug; the others dupes and impostors. Yet similar humbugs have been of vigorous growth and long continuance, and what finds favor among men in the present age will probably be quite as readily received by the next. But whether these speculations have a founda- tion in fact or in fancy, the future must decide, and another generation will probably be able to judge with cer- tainty. 'Our long colloquy erhded, and I bade my friend farewell with a feeling of regret. H e was a graduate of, Old Har- vard, and was closely connected with some of the most distinguished families in Massachusetts. We parted near the Tithing office, and I never saw him more. Two days after, I received intimation that he had been dispatched on a secret and highly important mission to a foreign land. Yet this man, according to Mrs. Farrow's statement, had three wives; one of them old enough to be his mother, ano ther middle-aged, and the third a mere child. I know very well that-such things appear incredible, but they are no -less facts, nor was he a solitary examnple of misdirected intelligence.

But the markets are capital places to study the varieties of life. The work-shops and small stores present at every step subjects for characteristic sketches, and set forth the every-day aspect of the common people. ' The piety of the Mormon. does not at all prevent his being extremely fond of a  good bargain, and, ten chances to one, if it stands in the way of his committing a regular, downright swindle, should an opportunity occur. The markets are well supplied with the usual comestibles of civilized life ; fis, flesh, and fowl abound, with all sorts of vegetables, butter, and cheese. - Little tables are usually   f :  -    aH OP-fEirS.         257 : set out in :onspicuous places,/with cakes, candies, and con- fectionaries, around which gather gay groups of soldiers, women, and children, laughing and chatting with all possible familiarity. You are surprised at the quantities of foreign wares conspicuously displayed in the windows. You had scarcely expected to find French gloves or Wellington boots. You think, perhaps, that the display of silks, costly shawls, and velvets, must be rather out of place. You begin to question in what manner they could ever have come here, forgetful that gold possesses a magic power that attracts everything which can be exchanged for it. But there are many shops of less pretention, devoted to the sale of second-hand or inferior articles, with clothes, hose, and similar goods of home-made manufacture. .You soon discover that the keepers of these establishments pos- sess a peculiar aptitude for trade. In dexterity and cun- ning they seem   even to surpass the Jews. You are surrounded in a moment by a dozen eager traders, all intent on selling you something, Aand each seeming to vie with the others in setting forth the value and utility of his wares. You cannot help feeling amused at the strange mixture of barbarous English, guttural German, and idio- matic French that reaches your ears; for these shop keepers are nearly all foreigners, and by them almost every nation in Europe is represented.

As yet you are unacquainted with his art, and look carelessly and indifferently around, till a beautifully embroidered buffalo-robe meets your gaze. Of course you have no use for that; it is in the midst of sum- mer, and you are thousands of miles away from home. It would be preposterous to swell your baggage with useless articles, but you can ask the price. The Frenchllman, how- ever, anticipates you. "Monsieur has well chosen," he says. "This is the most beautiful article of the kind in the market. Lord George Gordon, I think it was, won't be sure about the name, but at any rate he was an English lord, bought three of them from an Indian princess.

The words have scarcely escaped your lips, when he flings it over your shoulders, and the only course left for you is to count the gold. The shops devoted to the sale of second-hand goods are quite as characteristic and interesting. Surely such a col- lection of worn-out dilapidated merchandise was never before seen. The people are as singular: as the wares offered for sale. Here are two women Holding a solemn council over a superannuated frock, which one would think entirely worth- less. Close by is another, driving a hard bargain for a battered bonnet of Parisian make, which has served as an ornament and protection to probably a dozen heads, and has finally, found its way into this repository of antiquities. Here is one of the few places in which you will find a crowd. In general the streets are so broad, and the houses cover so small a portion of the ground, that you might almost fancy yourself in a town deserted by its inhabitants. But here the crowd, and throng, and press, are sufficient to make it 'all up. You look around, and wish yourself away, and the i  wish preludes the attempt to get away. In this you are obstructed by some venders of street merchandise, who cry their wares in your ears with downright effrontery, or block- ade the passage, so that you must either stop or run over them; of course you prefer the former.

If they get to quarrelling, I let them take it out over the face and eyes, and I tell you what, they have pretty warm work sometimes." You perhaps tell him that the whole system is an abomi- nation, when he laughs in your face, refers you to great examples, and persists in teasing you to buy. Finally, to escape the persecution, you purchase something, a trinket, perhaps, or fine-tooth comb, but be sure it is something you do not want, and for which you have no use.

There can be no doubt that when the increase of population demands it, and suffi- cinat inducements are offered, extensive manufactories rivalling those of the East will be put in operation. At pre- sent, the females card, spin,' and weave much after the fashion of our grandmothers, and some of the most beautiful blankets and the finest linen I ever beheld, was shown to me, with commendable pride, as being the work of their skillful fingers. It must not be supposed that the Mormons are all concentrated in Salt Lake City. A vast eitent of territory is being rapidly filled up with them. ] In the country, too, that is, on the farms, where the women --have constant and regular employment-where one weaves, and another spins, the third attends to the dairy, and the fourth is house- keeper-where there is plenty of the comforts, and many of the luxuries of life, polygamy seems to be attended by fewer evils, and to be the occasion of much less discomfort than in more confined situations, though of course the immorality of the practice is the same. The attention of the Mormons seems to have been early attracted to the manufacture of sugar from the beet-root. In 1852, a complete set of machinery for that purpose was imported thither at immense cost, and, after some delay, put in operation. The raising of beets excited afurore for the time in Mormondom, almost equal to the Multicaulis mania in the Eastern States. Gardens, fields, and even house- yards were planted with the saccharine vegetable. But the want of sufficiently experienced and competent workmen was   AVERSION TO OUTSDERSB.      263 severely felt. The cost of sugar production was found to greatly exceed that of importation, to say nothing of the superior quality of the latter. The experiment, though not a success, could not be considered an absolute failure. The practicability was tested, and probably some future age may reap the benefits of it. The Mormons are exceedingly adverse to dependence on outsiders, characterized lthem as Gentiles. This disposi- tion might tend So facilitate their progress in the mechanic arts, but they are almost equally opposed to profiting by the superior skill, knowledge, and attainments of those who, from education or principle, are opposed to their domestic institutions and their church.  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC8190-00000134"/> 264      TfE HUSBAND IN UTA.  CHAPTER XVI. SCHOOLS-LITERATURE--INTRODUCTION TO ELDER -XIMBALL, ETC. S might be supposed, the Mormon schools have nothing to boast of, being little more than an appanage of the church, where the children and youth may be trained in its doctrines, and brought up in habits of unlimited obedience to its requirements. The elders appoint the teachers, select the books, and superintend the general affairs of all con- nected with them. The Catholic Church in its palmy days- never manifested more jealousy of heretical doctrines, or was more vigorous in the expulsion of all works considered of that tendency. "What sciences do they teach, then?" you question. "What principles of political or domestic economy arre instilled into the tender minds of their youth?"

One of these ladies, females are all ladies in this age, came one day to the house of Mrs. Farrow to purchase necessa- ries, as she -termed it. These consisted of half a pint of molasses, half a pound of coffee, three candles, and an ounce of tea. I thought she must be well qualified to give the children lessons in economy. She was altogether one of the most remarkable specimens of womanhood I had seen in Utah-tall, though much--bent, stout, bony, square-cor- nered-with cold, yet eager grey eyes, grim aspect, and great volubility. A paralytic attack had deprived her of the use of one side, her arm was useless, and she was obliged to walk with a crutch. Indeed, she was down on the list as a pauper, till Brigham Young, actuated either by motives of charity or the desire to relieve the church of a burden, gave her the appointment of school-teacher, with the under- standing that in such a situation she must take care of her- self. ' Yet this singular woman had, seen better days. Some- where in the states she had a i husband and children, but their hearts having proved too hard to be softened by the new revelation, she abandoned them in the company of the first Great Prophet's family. She had one thousand dollars in her own right, and after managing to get hold of this the rogue, by the power of a special revelation, deliver- ed her over to the keeping of another. She remained with him a year, when he died, .,and she was left without friends 12 L  '  .  * ^  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC8190-00000135"/> 266       THE HUSBMAND N 'UTAH. or means.. But she had great industry, and having cast her lot with the saints, would not be separated from them. So she floated along in the current of emigration to Salt Lake City, working all the time like a slave. "Hqw many scholars, have you?"I inquired, when in- formed of her profession. "No particular number, sometimes near forty, and at others not over ten."  "Then the children are not regulrn attendance." "I don't think it makes much difference," she replied. "They do little besides knitting, sewing, and saying their catechism." "Manual labor, and theology," I suggested. "Do you not teach grammar?" "Grammar, no ; what's the use of grammar? . I never could see any sense in it, and very much doubt if any body else can. I wish my scholars to understand what pertains to their salvation, rather than the wisdom of this-world, which fadeth away."  "But, madam, life and its trials are here." She turned curtly away and made no answer. Yet so far as I could learn, she was a tolerably fair example of the class of school-teachers; but priestcraft, -all the world over, has been afraid of knowledge. -The spirit of the age, demands a school of some kind. It might be dangerous to refuse, hence the school is established, but is contrived to be only an- accessory of superstition. The Mormons have what they call a Library, though it   INTRODUCTION TO ELDER KIMBALL.     267 is not very well supplied with books. To make up the deficiency, however, the works, as a general thing, were well selected. Hume and Paine found a place side by side with Robertson and Volney. The most approved histories of ancient and modern times were conspicuously displayed, but there was little poetry, and less light literature, though a few standard novels were there, among which I particularly noticed the works of Dickens and Marryatt. While conversing with the librarian, Elder Kimball was seen approaching. I knew him to be one of the first men in the place, and when he entered we were introduced. He was very sociable, expressed great pleasure at seeing me, though I doubted his sincerity, and even went so far as to insinuate a desire that I would make his country my perma. nent home, declaring that it was one of the finest places on A   the earth, that the beauty of the climate, the magnificence of the scenery, and the fertility of the soil were altogether unsurpassed. He then expatiated largely on the unity and brotherly love that prevailed-the obedience and fecundity of the wives--with the wealth and generous tempers of the husbands. I was not disposed to controvert his position, but made some inquiries about the general appreciation of literature, and whether or not the use of the library were permitted to all indiscriminately.

"To all indiscriminately," 'he repliedi " with certain reser- vations and exceptions, that mean nothing." "Bt meaning nothing, why are they made?" He laughed lightly, and turning to the librarian, inquired if I had seen "' those choice manuscripts." As I had not; they were immediately produced. The one was a volume of poems by Eliza Snow, of which the principal ones have been published in the Deseret News. They were written in a fine, though legible running hand, and were much more interesting as a specimen of chirography than as poetry. The other was on the subject of theology, by Parley Pratt. "These works have never been published?"I said. "They have not," he answered. "We prize them very highly, and that is probably the reason why they have never been published." "Indeed." "Certainly ; there can be no doubt that if given to the world there would be a diversity of sentiment about them; at present there can be but one." "An original reason, truly."  "You must remember," continued the elder, "that the Mormon church is yet in its infaccy. Under the pressure of persecution, misrepresentations, and false doctrines from without, there could be little encouragement for the exercise of original genius. - We value these works rather for what they portend than for what they are.

"You design to monopolize the future?" "In part, and to speak in common parlance, who has a better right?

"Few come here with any other purpose in view than to turn us, and all we possess, into disgrace. They determine to be dissatisfied from the first, and with the utmost want of politeness and good breeding themselves, demand the most rigid courtesy of us. In their sight, we are no longer men, but beasts. I suppose they would deny us the privilege of living or breath- ing if they could. One woman who stopped here on her way toCalifornia, made great complaints that she was not treated with proper deference, because some men on the other side of a bridge preferred to walk over previous to her. Yet this same woman, lady I will not call her, never hesitated to quiz any one and everybody who came in her, way, demanding of women how many wives their husbands might have, and questioning little children about their father's families."     . ".Disagreeable, certainly." "Outrageous, scandalous," he persisted. "If, they do not like us, all they have to do is to let us alone; it is all we ask; our protection and dependence is 'all of ourselves. We ask no assistance from an arm of flesh." I have reason to believe, indeed I know, that similar feel- ings are generally cherished. They only wish to hold com- munication with the- "Gentiles" when such intercourse can be made beneficial to themselves, and contribute to forward their impious designs.

CHAPTER XV11.L DECEPTIONS-RASCALITIES-DUPES-IMPOSTORS-- PARLEY PRATT --HS SCHEMES TO RAISE MONEY--A BEREAVED HUSBAND AND FATHER, ETC. MORMONISM, from first to last, is'a system of delusion and imposition, consequently the votaries of that faith can .only be regarded in the light of impostors. Yet we cannot for a moment doubt that many of the weak-minded and ignorant men, and still more of the women, are actually sincere in their belief, and would probably endure martyr- dom rather-than renounce their faith. The elders, many of whom are men of decided talent and intelligence, seem to have brought deception to an art, and to practise it sys- tematically. Foreign countries present, of course, the most eligible theatre for their operations, and hundreds of mis- sionaries are constantly employed. These expatiate on the wonderful facilities to acquire wealth, and possess happiness, in the Mormon country-on the beauty and healthfulness of the climate, the exuberant fruitfulness of the soil, the dowry of land and stock, with the great demand for mechanic   - AN OPPOSER OF POLYGAMY.     273 labor. Sometimes they mention polygamy incidentally, though it is but too evident that many come here without the least suspicion of, being brought into contact with such an institution, but whose-disgust and horror, when informed of it, cannot shake their faith in the seductive impos- ture. I was much' pleased with the appearance of a beautiful little girl, who came on errands to Mrs. Farrow's store. She belonged to an English family of the better class, was very talkative and intelligent, and so prettily dressed that with her large, limpid blue eyes and floating curls, she looked like a fairy. "Is that lovely creature's home contaminated by the plu- rality system?"I queried of my good landlady. "No, indeed. I should as soon expect to see the summer turn to barrenness as Edward Cunningham with a second wife."  "Is he then an opposer of polygamy?" "I should think that he was." "And his wife?" "It would kill her, at lea-t she says that it would, and I cannot doubt it. Never was a woman more devoted to a man. Yet they do say,; continued Mrs. Farrow, "that some of the elders have exerted all their influence to induce him to take another wife." "I cannot see why they should have so much interest in the matter." "They say such examples are bad for the women whose 12*  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC8190-00000139"/> 9749      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. husbands have polygamous tendencies-that it makes them jealous, discontented, dissatisfied!" "I presume they will conquer in the end. If he believes their creed, it is scarcely possible that he can escape the contaminating influences brought to bear upon him." "He not only believes their creed, but is one of them," she answered, "or, perhaps I should say, one of us; for though I am opposed to some things the elders do and teach, I am-professedly a rigid Mormon." I could not refrain from smiling. "Well, as I was saying, Mr. Cunningham is a man of busi- ness capacity, holds a subordinate position in the Legislative Assembly, and-is mueh honored and sought after, though 'Mrs. Cunningham declares that had she known of polygamy and some other things, she would never have come here." "Then they did not know of it." "They never dreamed of it till somebody in St. Louis told them. But Mr. Cunningham asserted that it could not be, and persisted in his belief that the whole story was a scandal, got up by the malice of their enemies, till he. received ocular demonstration of the fact. Heighho, our elders are but men." Subsequently I had the pleasure of making Mrs. Cunning- ham's acquaintance, and 'learning further items in their his- tory. She had a family of beautiful daughters, and her maternal apprehensions with regard to their future fate were -easily excited. Lascivious eyes had already been cast upon them, and John Taylor, an old man, deformed and crippled,   MRS. OUNNINGHAM S EXPERIENCE.     27S who had been- wounded when Joe Smith was killed, and who was the husband of six half-starved wives, had actually pro- sumed to solicit that one of the blooming creatures might be sealed to him. 1 "Why," said the'passionate woman, her face flushing with excitement, "I would rather see my child dying at my feet, than know that such a doom  awaited her. The hideous old ogre i" She went on to tell how they had been cheated and deceived in various wa/ys, prefacing her account, however, with a hope that I would not betray her confidence, and saying that it was a relief to have the privilege of unbosom- ing her troubles to some onel whose mind was not warped with the infatuation that had been their ruin. She had an elegant piano, sofa, and other furniture usual with people in their station of life. The boxes in which they were packed arrived safely at St. Louis, when the Mor- mon agent, into whose hands they passed, took the liberty of opening and inspecting them. He was delighted with the prospect of punder, and succeeded in convincing Mrs. C :  that she had better leave the things with him, as the dry air of the plains, arid other emergencies, would render them worthless, and that he would give her a draft for their value, to be drawn on the governor. She complied with  this proposition, though with great reluctance, but her surprise was greater when arriving at Utah, and presenting her draft; the dignitary protested it, saying thatl it "wasn't worth the first red cent."  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC8190-00000140"/> 2t6      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. "I wouldn't have minded it so much," she said, " but we really needed the money. We were poor enough I can assure you.' I had never before known what poverty was. When we started to cross the plains, a number of wagons drawn by cattle were loaded with our goods, but my hus- band had not been accustomed to such travelling, or to taking care of cattle. His hired men were brutal. Over- exertion and the want of necessary nutriment reduced the animals to skeletons. They soon gave- out, and their bleaching bones mark the path for the future traveller. Worn out with suffering, and destitute, we arrived in the vicinity of the Salt Lake." It is customary with the Morimon leader, to go out a day's journey to meet an emigrating party, entertaining them with music, and fresh provisions, as a foretaste of the :g6bd things in store for them. It enables him to make a show, and gives a certain air of triumph on the acquisition of numbers to his church. "We were struggling through the mountain passes, weary and despondent," said Mrs. Cunningham " when our ears were, suddenly delighted with the sound of music, breathing and dying away amonig the hills, or rolling out in waves of harmony, that reverberated from rock to rock. We listened with beating hearts when a courier rode up, and informed us that the Leader was approaching with an escort to con- duct us to the city." "A token of welcome, I suppose." "And our hearts were gladdened by it; but, oh, sir, it                  w   DTSMAT, p SptaS.        2" did not last long. A few days found us living in this little house, so destitute of comfort, that for my children's sake, I know not what to do. For myself, I could bear it, but where are the advantages and accomplishments that I had promised my daughters. What is their prospective future? tit makes me shudder to think of it." This, I am satisfied is the case with many mothers, even of those who sit down quietly themselves under the curse of polygamy. They can bear it, but their hearts bleed for their daughters. And many a father who practises it unhesitatingly himself, shrinks with horror and despair from the immolation of a favorite child. "My hufsband," continued Mrs. Cunningham, " is very industrious ; yet, not being accustomed to manual labor, he could do little that way. The property he invested in the church has never returned him a cent, and probably never will. A situation was offered him in the theatre, and abso- lute necessity induced him to accept it. His days are spent copying laws, and his nights are devoted to those dissolute scenes. Oh, sir, my heart aches and my brain is maddened, when I think of it." The infatuation of this woman was effectually cured, but too late-too late-for all practical purposes. Her hand was fairly in the lion's mouth, and she could not remove it, nor break his teeth. I subsequently 'beheld her husband. He looked pale, discouraged, and worn out, though evidently pleased with the attention and respect his presence always com-  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC8190-00000141"/> 278      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. manded. But more substantial comforts were needed to render his life happy, and of these he found few enough. Few people are more to be pitied than those dupes of Mormon duplicity, who, belonging to the better class of foreigners, and unable from ignorance and the want of habit to. obtain a living by manual labor, embark their property as a speculation in the hands of the church, and are then left with their families in a beggarly state of wretchedness. Utah is rife with such examples yet the Mormon elders are really kind and generous to such poor emigrants as can work, and thereby increase the productive industry, and consequently the wealth of the country. They'are much too politic and observant not to understand the value to any community of a sturdy, hard-working yeomanry. I was much interested in the story of a rich German family, who had been converted to Mormonism, and the idea of emigration. It is really strange to me how people can be so easily induced to leave their homes, and the sweet associations of their childhood and riper years. But it is-the old story of the dog and the bone. Though well off, they concluded that their circumstances might be improved. They saw the shadow in the water, leaped for it,- and lost their all. When the various items of their property was collected together, it amounted to the snug sum of 15 or 20,000 dollars in gold, silver, plate, and jewelry. And of all this the silly man was induced to 'resign possession in favor of the elder to whom he attributed his conversion, that worthy promising, of course, to make all right at a subl   MSPLACED CONFIDENCE.       279 sequent day, to secure state-rooms for the family on board the ship in which they were to emigrate, and to provide them necessary and respectable accommodations on the entire route. Imagine, therefore, the surprise and indignation of this husband and father, when he found himself, his family, and -. all their baggage crowded into the steerage, amid filth, fever, noisome smells, and indescribable indecency. He remonstrated with the captain, but in vain. That dignitary plainly told him that it was too late to make alterations in the arrangements of the ship, and that if he confided his affairs to the discretion of a Mormon priest, there was no alternative but to abide the consequences. The elder, meanwhile, was accommodated with two state-rooms, and every convenience and luxury. Compelled to submit, but extremely dissatisfied with their treatment, they were landed at New York, and being utter strangers to the language, and customs of our country, without means or -fiends, nothing remained for them, but to float along in the current of emigration to Salt Lake. Here they were lodged in a wretched hut, without even the commonest necessaries of life, or any prospect of a bet- ter 'condition. They have made some disagreeable discover- ies. They have ascertained that the property deposited by the husband in the hands of the elder, belongs to the church, that if he wants a house, one can be built for him, for which he will be indebted to the church; and worse than all, that thei daughters are approaching a  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC8190-00000142"/> 280       THE UBBND    UTAH. marriageable age, and will soon be wanted to swell the number of victims to the institution of the church. They knew nothing of polygamy before coming here, ,and were filled with disgust and terror at the prospect before them. Yet it should not be supposed that these particular cases of individual suffering and discontent are general throughout the community, or that all, without exceptions, are utterly vile and depraved. Many,/doubtless, are pure in their feel- ings, and sincere in their desires to serve God, however -mistaken and unfounded the views' they have learned to entertain. Many would be glad to be freed from   their bonds, and like a liberated bird, exult at their release; but others are infatuated with their lot, and no inducement could tempt them to abandon it. In the language of the Scriptures, "-they are joined to their idols." What an awful weight of responsibility rests on the heads of the reverend guides and directors of the Mormon people, and what a fearful reckoning will bt theirs in the great day of accounts. As usual with their class in all ages and countries, these men are 'inveterate worshipers of the golden calf. They bow before it, it fills their imaginations, and concentrates their desires. Their cry for gold is inces- sant, and when this necessary article is not to be had at home in sufficient quantities, they generally start out on a mission, and thus it rarely fails that their pockets are reple- nished. It is rumored, though whether with truth or not I cannot pretend to say, that some of the elders, who have been best supplied with wives, have disposed of the- super-   PARLEY PRATT.      '   281 flUous to Indian chiefs, or half-breeds in the neighborhood; in all cases for a; valuable consideration in horses, furs, or other articles of ready merchandise. Incredible as this might appear, if related of any other enlightened community, I see no reason for disputing its occurrence here. The slavery and merchandise of women is the usual attendant of polygamy. Both are parts of one system, and in all countries where the former is tolerated, the latter comes in as coeval-and co-existent. I cannot see why the example of the patriarchs might not be quoted to support the one as well as the other, and with equal propriety. Parley Pratt, a noted saint in this region, an elder, and the husband of a multitude of wives, is accused of being the originator of this scheme to "raise the wind." At any rate, one or two of the Mrs. Pratts mysteriously disappear- ed, and the elder immediately came out with a fine stud of horses, known to have belonged to Walker, the Utah Chief. As report goes, a trapper, who visited Walker's lodge some- time afterwards, found it- inhabited by two or three white women, and, to his great amazement, learned the particu- lars of the affair. Parley, however, made a handsome speculation, sold the horses to some California emigrants, and employed the money in furnishing himself with an out- fit for a mission to Chili. The Mormon Missionaries make great pretensions to humility, and of going without purse or scrip, but this is only an excuse for'the mendicity they affect and practise. The initiated know very well, that large private resources  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC8190-00000143"/> 282      . THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. are at their command, though it is only in cases of emer- gency that they can be induced to resort to them. Parley is likewise an inveterate borrower. Mrs. Farrow informed me of several sisters, who having inherited money from Eastern quarters, were immediately assailed by the necessitated priest, whose exceedinglyl bland and courteous manner is seldom without its influence on the female mind. But it seems that men sometimes are quite as easily deluded as women, and this redoubtable elder, seems to drive a brisk trade at wheedling and swindling them. A poor man at San Bernardina, was induced by the wily hypocrite, to trust two or three hundred dollars of hard earnings in his hands. Repayment, though promised at the time, was never performed, and never will be. This man has a very even flow of language, converses with great ease, has the most. perfect suavity of manner, and looks altogether as if he never did and never could do wrong. He has great command of his countenance, never gets angry, though at times you can catch the lurking devil in his eye. Indeed he is a perfect specimen of the class of sanctimonious rascals. There seems a positive cruelty in the disposition of this man, which manifests itself in the sundering'of family-ties and connections. He has persuaded daughters to abandon their homes, wives to forsake their husbands, and mothers their children. He has carried blight: and desolation to many a fireside, and caused pangs fiercer' than those of   DETESTABLE PRACTICES.       283 death to many a human heart. Many a history of wrong  and shame, in which he has been chief actor, might be related. Many a tale of moral delinquency; and mental anguish and bereavement, is connected with his endeavors and success in proselyting unbelievers. Of course, many of the others-are equally wicked, and the distress they occasion by the separation of friends and families is actually incalcu- lable. I saw a beautiful young woman, who had abandoned her mother's dying bed, and left her grey-haired father to descend in sorrowful loneliness to the grave, to follow one of these impostors, and become his tenth or twentieth wife. This was vaunted as a great act of heroism on her part, and her praises were sung in all their churches. Another had deserted her lover and prospective husband, who was well nigh distracted; and a third was forcibly plucked from their clutches by her brother, who invoked the aid of the law (k). Yet so great was her infatuation, that all his prayers and entreaties were of no avail. It the night she arose, tore the sheets of her bed into strips, let herself down by them from the chamber window, and escaped to them. When sought again, she was not to be found; they had secreted her. Sometimes women, sometimes men, (1.) and sometimes children, fall victims to their arts. Their presence in the family circle is the sure prelude of misery and sin. The tale of Mr. Hays, an English cattle-trader, is only one amongst a thousand that might be told of the fanaticism and diabolism that ever attends the hideous and slimy  course of Mormonism in its progress over-the world.  ,  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC8190-00000144"/> 284.      THE itSBAND IN UTAH. This gentleman was wealthy and respectable. He had a beautiful cottage, situated on a small stream in the north of England; grounds tastefully laid out, surrounded it, and peace, plenty, and domestic happiness, abode within. The wife was loving and beloved; the daughters beautiful and obedient; the son honorable and intelligent. One stormy night, in the autumn of 1854, two mounted strangers came to the gate, and implored, for the sake of human brother- hood, that shelter and protection might be afforded them for the night. Mr. Hays, who could never find it in his heart to refuse the shelter of his roof even to the wandering men- dicant, readily granted their request. His servants were directed to take care of their hbrses; they were invited to his parlor, and made welcome at his board. The suavity of their manners, their intelligence and apparent respectability wok largely on the heart of the good man, and when it came out that they were Americans, and designed to stay some days in the neighborhood, he invited them to consider his house their home. For several days the subject of Mor- monism was not broached, indeed their first endeavors seemed to be to gain the good will-of the family. In this they fully succeeded, when their designs were gradually unfolded. ' However, the strong good sense of Mr. Hays preserved him from falling a victim to the delusion, but the son was easily dazzled with their glowing pictures of Mormon life and libertinism. He deserted his parents, went to Utah, was, it seems, highly delighted, was elevated to posts of   - A TRAITOROUS SON.       285 dignity and importance, and with each step became more and more in love with the institutions of Mormondom. When his faith was sufficiently established, and it was deemed expedient, he was returned to England as a mission- ary. His first efforts were against his father's house, but the good man, though receiving his son affectionately, utterly forbade all mention of his heretical doctrines. Opportunities, however, were not wanting ; the mother and sisters were duped, and consented to elope and go to Utah, without letting the husband and father into the secret of their designs. Such is the effect of fanaticism; it sears the heart, and renders it insensible to sympathy or natural affection. One Monday, after the arrival of his son, Mr. Hays started on one of, his usual expeditions to purchase cattle, leaving a large sum in money, a gold watch, and other valuables in the charge of his wife. He left his home just as years of domestic quiet, and happiness had endeared it to him, without a thought or misgiving of the fearful destruction awaiting his treasures. He returned on Satur- day, eager to greet his loved ones, and receive their affec- tionate welcome; but how great was his surprise, how unspeakable his horror I His habitation was stripped and deserted. There was no affectionate greeting, no provision for his comfort. He called, but there was no answer, and to describe his consternation and distress would be impossi- ble. The wife had not only deserted, but robbed her hus- band, and the son had proved the betrayer of his father. They had likewise induced all the children to accompany  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC8190-00000145"/> 286  ,    THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. them; the money, the jewels, the plate, everything portable, even to the bed-linen, had been removed. The poor man applied to the police in a state actually bordering. on distraction, and without suspecting that Mor- monism had wrought his ruin. By careful inquiries, and previous knowledge of the Mormoni character, the officers were induced to believe that such might be the case. They hastened to Liverpool, and learning that a large emigrating party- of that people had just departed in the ship Good Hope, Captain Sanders, for the New World, it was thought his family might be on board. A steamtug, moored at the dock, with the fires up, was put in requisition, and the pur- suit commenced. But the morning was far advanced, and the little party of pursuers were not much encouraged by the captain to hope that they would have any chance of overhauling the Good Hope, for she 'had been taken out to sea by a strong tug, and had all her sails set to a favoring breeze. After crossing the bar at the mouth of the Mersey, a dark object -like *a speck was discovered on the horizon, which the captain of the steamtug made out with his glass, and pronounced to be the ship. For two or three hours the chase continued, when it became evident that they were fast gaining on the big ship. When within hailing distance, the captain of the Good Hope slackened sail, supposing that his pursuers were the custom-house officers, and had scented something wrong.   Coming alongside, the party jumped aboard, and when they announced their errand, the excite- ment among the Mormons was intense.     The captain   -A HEBRTLESS WE.        87 received them courteously, invited them into his cabin, and asked to see the warrants utnder which they were acting. They had none, but that a husband should be so basely deceived and robbed of his household gods and goods at once, was pronounced and felt by the captain, who declared himself no Mormon, and 'ignorant dF the whole affair, an unendurable rascality, and he was evidently anxious to render the bereaved and nearly distracted man all the assistance in his power. The women and children, however, were kept carefully out of sight between decks. As the search went on; the excitement increased. The poor husband became almost a raving maniac ; alternately praying, coaxing, and threatening, sometimes actually kneel- ing-at the feet of the Mormon leaders, and beseeching them with words and gestures that should have melted a heart of stone, to restore his family. His entreaties were seconded by those of the captain and officers; but all were in vain. For two hours this scene continued, the ship all the time being carried further and further out to sea. Finally the officers declared that rather than fail in their mission, they would accompany the vessel to Boston, and denounce the whole gang of Mormon impostors to the British authorities tin that city. The firmness of the officers had its effect, and the elders consented to produce the woman, and let her have an -interview with her husband. ,The heartless creature manifested the utmost indifference to his distress, refused even to accept his proffered hand 'as a token of friendship, and turned a deaf ear to all his remonstrances, until the  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC8190-00000146"/> :288      THETHE HUSBAND IN UTAH. officers interposed, telling her that if she persisted in her determination, she would be denounced to the Boston authorities, and probably imprisoned. This information shook her resolution; with streaming tears and accents of woe, she bade farewell to her deceivers, and was handed into the tug with the youngest child. The husband still knelt on the bulwarks, the very picture of paternal distress, praying and entreating that yet more of his children might be restored to him. Even some of the Mormons were moved at his anguish; they began to murmur, and say that it was a shame and unnatural to separate a father from his children. At thisiuncture, the Mormon elders peremptorily ordered their subordinates to go below, but the captain, finding that numbers were on his side, ordered the two little girls of seven and nine years to be handed to their delighted parent. Two other daughters, seventeen and nineteen years of age, absolutely refused to return. Finding it impossible to break the spell of 'their infatuation, the tug cast off, and returned to Liverpool, where a large number of people were collected on the docks, anxiously waiting to learn the suc- cess of the expedition.

TME MMORON PARTY-MORMON BEiLES-INCIDENTAL NOTICE OF BRIGHAM YOUNG AND HS FAMLY, ETC. ATTENDED the Mormon party, to which Elder Kimball had been so polite as tQ extend me an invitation. It was sufficiently unique, and the first thing that surprised me was the great disparity between the numbers of women and the men. In my boyish days I had been accustomed to attend parties of pleasure in country places, where the invitations having been extended almost indiscriminately, resulted in iing three or four young men to every lady. In more selec/ssemblies they were always duly paired, but here each gentleman came attended by two, three, four, or even a greater number of the opposite sexi Ladies were on the sofas, in the chairs, and there was an abundance of wall- flowers. Surely the Mormons have not to complain of a scarcity of women, as is usual with many newly-settled States. Cotillions were the order of the day, and the figures were so arranged, that each gentleman danced with two ladies. A raised platform, well furnished with seats, accommodated   Tm   MORMON PARTY.       291-- the band of music, and more distinguished spectators, whose habits or disinclination forbade their taking part in the dance. Several of the elders countenanced the proceedings with their presence, attended, by their wives, both old and young. A number of Gentiles were present, among whom I noticed some young ladies who were attached to a California cara- van, and whose beauty it was evident made a decided impression on the susceptible Mormon elders, and their sub- jects. Several Mormon belles were pointed out to me, and con- stant flirtations and coquetries were carried on in the inter- vals of: the dance. These young ladies, however, either were or appeared decidedly partial to outsiders, and some dashing Californians were evidently made happy by the tokens of their partiality. One young fellow, ferociously bearded, and dressed in the extreme of Parisian style, attracted much attention. One ungloved hand was literally bespangled with rings, a large gold chain attached to a watch of the same metal, crossed his vest, and a diamond pin glittered on his bosom. He was evidently a gentleman loafer or gambler, and his attentions to the ladies seemed particularly displeasing in certain quarters. "These girls seem partial to the Gentiles," I observed to one of the bystanders. "Pshaw," he   replied, "that fellow, has gold in  his pockets, as well as on his person, they are after that."  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC8190-00000148"/> 292      TIM flu SiND IS TTAB. "'Think so?" "Nothing can be more certain. There will be a row soon. These Mormons are jealous fellows." Before I had time toreply, supper was announced, and there was a general scramble. The Californian gave his arm to one of the ladies,/the most beautiful in the company. She accepted it with appa- rent pleasure. He seated himself by her side at table, and helped her to the daintiest viands, receiving the brightest smiles and most beaming glances in return. The feast would have charmed an epicure, and both the elder who gave the party, and his numerous wives, seemed pleased with the hilarity and enjoyment of their guests. After supper, the dancing was resumed; the Californian meantime monopolizing. the beauty, and regarding those around him with a sneer and grin, that showed his white teeth glittering through his Moustache, exactly as a wolf might be supposed to regard his compeers, should -they 'i1 approach too near some dainty morsel reserved for him- self. "He'll haul in, his horns, when-Sam Sloan gets sight of him," said some one at my elbow. "I'll stake my salvation on that, any time." "Who is Sam Sloan?" "A young Mormon, who's a match for any Californian," was the answer. I had before heard of this worthy, and waited with some impatience for his appearance.   A ROW.          293 I was doomed to. disappointment. He did not come, but another young fellow, flush and fiery, walked up to the lady, and asked her hand for the dance. She was engaged for the evening. He turne d away, regarding the moustached Californian with a scowl of defiance, quite as black as his own. The fellow clapped his band to his side, as if to draw thence-a concealed weapon, when the Mormon deliberately trod on his toes. There was a low growl of rage, followed by a heavy blow. The Mormon staggered, but recovered in a moment, and returned it with interest. Others rushed in, not to separate, but take part with the combatants. "As I told you," whispered one beside me. -The- dancing ceased; there was a halt in the music; ladies screamed, the elders rose. At length, when the tumult was. fast becoming general, a voice rang out above the din in. clear, autthoritastive tones. "Put those fellows out in an instant," it said, " and pro, ceed with, the amusement.", Fifty stout men sprang in a moment to obey the orders, while I turned to- look at the speaker, and recognized Brigham: Youg. He had sat, silent and unnoticed, crouched in a dark pcorner, with, his hat on, though the others were uncovered. Whether this wasg accidental or the result of design,l I am unable to say. Certain it is, that his Mormon majesty never removes his hat in public.

Brigham Young is a remarkable man, second to the Mohammed of the Western Continent, and like Abubeker and Ali, abundantly qualified to carry out and perpetuate his scheme of imposture and fanaticism. He can ejiact the part of chief magistrate and supreme pontiff, or, with equal facility, he turns mountebank and astonishes the world by such antics as few civil and religious functionaries would dare to attempt. He supports by precept and example a domestic institution never before admitted among enlighten- ed people, yet his community receives monthly accessions of strength by thearrival of emigrant converts from the dif- ferent European nations. Young, beautiful, and accom- plished women-; men of property and intelligence lay their offerings on the shrine of his faith, solicitous of his benedic- tions, and obedient to his mandates. Some of his messages from the pulpit are perfect gems in their way, witty, original, in many respects decidedly laughable, and utterly unlike anything of the kind ever heard before. He chooses texts from a Bible, a newspaper, or an almanac. He quaintly touches on every conceivable topic--war, com- merce, peace, industry, art, and love. These comprehen- sive addresses generally include a pretty sharp dig at the President, and rather severe criticism on governmental affairs at Washington. Indeed, it is evident that indistinct visions of future greatness, and supreme independent power, some- times float through the brain of the distinguished hierarchy yet his strong good sense prevents any undue display of vanity or self-impertance. At. this time it is impossible to   BBIGHAM  YO1NQ.         29Y balance his faults and virtues, or to decide whether the title of enthusiast or impostor more properly belongs to him and his predecessor. There is but a step between the two. The warm suggestions of fancy might be mistaken for particular inspirations from heaven ; the labor of thought may expire in rapture and vision, and the inward sensation take, to? the deluded understanding, the form and attributes of an angel of God. History is filled with such instances. Numa, the beloved citizen, good king, and wise legislator, believed in his Egeria, and the demon of Socrates is a memorable example of how a wise man may deceive himself, how a good man may delude others, and how quietly the conscience may slumber in a middle state between self-illusion and volun- tary fraud. It is said that a prophet never has honor in his own country, and with equal propriety might have been added nor in his own time and age. The judgment of contem- poraries is generally inflamed by passion and prejudice, and it is a trait of human nature to despise the day of small things. Yet- "Large streams from little fountains flow- T! all oaks from little acorns grow." As an evidence of the talent and ability of the Mormon leader, I would let facts speak for themselves. They will reverberate through future ages, and influence the decisions of posterity. Whether -famous or. infamous, the name of Brigham Young is inseparably connected with the origin  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC8190-00000150"/> I      , *' .      THE at tVSAD  N UTAH. and history of a numerous and remarkable sebt. When strong enthusiasm impelled from within, and a fiery persecu- tion pressed from hout, he led them, then numbering many thousands, to Reek a safe home in the distant and almost impenetrable-wilderness. Could it have been mere chance or accident, or was it an extraordinary foresight that led them thither to build a city, that, like Tadmor in the Wilderness, should be a half-way house-a grand cara- vansera, to gather wealth and importance from the hun- dreds- of thousands soon to be. on their way to the Pacific shores.  Peace with the Mormons was not necessary in Illinois; it is at the great Salt Lake. This, man, likewise has-mana ged to, acquire and retain an -almost unbounded influence. over the minds of his followers. Neither envy, malice; nor rival leaders have succeeded in dethroning him.  Even the, worthy President seems to have considered the experiment of forcibly ejecting him. from authority as an act of dangerous tendency. Why else was the appointment, of Colonel Steptoe, to the territorial govern- ment of Utah and Mormondom suffered to quietly fall to the ground, when it was ascertained that Brigham would not willingly resign. Thi, step. affords a dangerous prece- dent.  Either the appointment should never have been mnade, or eEse cairned out- at all hazards. If-the general government cannot or does not make them respect its authority now, what are. wq, to expect when the population Of Utah haa. ioeasedi sevenflr  Yet it: must ba confessed that Brigham.

Setting himself above the laws of his country, and scorning the wisdom  of others, his own mother wit readily served as a substitute for both. Yet like many other great men, the Mormon leader is not eminently dis- tinguished for the moral virtues. In fact, he affects no superior sanctity, but is rather all things to all men. To the man of business, he is a man of business ; to the man of pleasure, a man of pleasure; to that class who, above all others, obtain the first place in the affections of a hero, he is most devoted in his attentions, and liberal of his gifts-- here a brooch, and there a ring ; here a collar, and there a muff. To those who have property to sell, he is a liberal buyer, and, to his credit be it spoken, he always pays -his debts. He is the munificent patron of artists and mechanics, especially those of his own people, and either employs them himself, or obtains employment for them. Yet Brigham Young  would be a dangerous enemy, and many fearful though secret crimes have been imputed to him, with what justice it is impossible to say. Perhaps the greatest evidence that these reports are not without foundation is afforded by the-fact, that he is so, afraid of assassination, as to be unpleasantly suspicious of strangers. Is this mere frailty of mental constitution, or is there another cause in the promptings of a guilty ^conscience? It is not only in the civil government of a people, or the rifntd a ed establishment of a new faith, that the chief of Mor  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC8190-00000151"/> 298      THE HUSBAND IN UTAH. mondom is distinguished. In his domestic relations he is equally remarkable. The conjugal ties of Mohammed sink into utter insignificance, when compared with those of the Mormon leader. The Commander of the Faithful, could only boast a daughter, while Brigham can point to his scores of children with the exultation of a Jewish Patriarch. It is evident, however, that motives of affection have not always governed in his choice of wives; many of these dames being old, ill-formed, and ugly, but it frequently hap- pens in matrimonial affairs, that the solid- charms of gold and silver are more highly prized than mental or- physical --accomplishments. It is said, too, that some of his vounger brides have been exceedingly reluctant, and that once or twice a rival disappeared in a remarkable manner.  But such reports are speedily hushed up without investigation, and the rumor left to itself soon dies. The polygamistic tendencies of the Mormon leader have been the  occasion of several tragic occurrences. How could it be otherwise when his insatiable appetite seems to increase with what it feeds on, and he is continually looking abroad for beautiful or wealthy women, whose physical or substantial charms can contribute to embellish still farther his domestic establishment. What is worse, the opposition of the female is never suffered to interfere with his arrange- ments.  By fair means or by  foul, by harsh or gentle measures, the  reluctance of the maiden must be over-' come. .He never abandons an object of pursuit or desire.

(i6  AITH, hope, and charity; and the greatest of these 1  is charity," saith the apostle. Faith in the abiding truths of Christianity, and the Rock of Ages; Hope in the strong good sense and principle of the Anglo-Saxon people; and Charity that covereth a multitude of sins, would lead us not to 'despair even of the Mormons. Influences,- both exterior and internal, are at work among them that can scarcely fail to soften and modify the more peculiar doctrines of their faith, and their most obnoxious practices. Could peoplekof other persuasions, with enlarged and benevolent views and motives, be induced to settle among them, esta- blish schools, and erect churches, there can be little doubt that in process of time a radical change might be effected in their peculiar tenets. Already the influence of the emi- grants and occasional visitors to the country, has. not been lost, and we may confidently anticipate that as travel   TEB YOUNG M  .    '   801 increases, and facilities for communication with other parts of the world are opened, while other communities and States spring up around them, the Mormons, for the sake of public opinion, and to conciliate the good witlf mankind, if for no other purpose, will grow ashamed of their excesses, and lop off such excrescences as must, when known, retard the pro- gress of their faith. Customs now tolerated for mere expe- dience and the increase of numbers, will be left to become nnfashionable, and finally grow obsolete, when the supposed necessity no longer exists. The younger portions of the community are evidently disaffected to the existing state of things. With the con- siderate, the thoughtful, and the intelligent, it could scarcely be otherwise. They know it to be an occasion of reproach, and naturally shrink before the contumely and maledictions of the civilized world. Thus far polygamy and its kindred vices have been indebted to the power of priestcraft for their support. When priestcraft falls, as it surely must, in the lapse of generations, we may expect the prohibition of its attendant vice. There is one class of the community whom hitherto I have not noticed, yet who are destined to act an important part in the future. I allude to the young men, flush, fiery fellows, characterized by a defiant air and independent spirit. Between these and the elders feuds and jealousies have already Wrisen, in many cases, and we cannot doubt that similar causes will produce the same effects, with still more gratifying results, in the tme to come. That the  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC8190-00000153"/> 302      THE  USBAND DI UTAH. elders should monopolize the youngest, most beautiful, and wealthy women, must of itself be'sufficiently displeasing to" the young men, without further aggravation from the fact, that as brothers they must witness the humiliation and unhappiness of their sisters, added to the dishonor and domestic annoyances of their mothers. I have heard young fellows anathematize the whole Mormon system on this account; while others would run off to California with their sweethearts, and there abide,; in order to preserve the objects of their love from falling beneath the libidinous influence of those they hated. Brothers frequently urge their sisters to depart for California, and escape the conta- mination of living in a Mormon harem.  A young man by the name of Bryce, a Mormon in sentiment, yet independent and, for a backwoodsman, uncommonly intelligent, said that he had a, sister whom Elder John Taylor had married for his sixth wife. That he considered such connections abomi- nable, and no marriage at all; that he told his sister so, and offered to bear her expenses wherever she wished to go, if she would only abandon the paramour. "And did she accept your offer?"I inquired. "No ; she said that here she was as good as the best ;" he answered, "but anywhere else she would certainly be despised, and her -child called by an opprobrious epithet, which she could not bear." A   young man, whose parents were from Oneida County, in the State of New York, expressed a  bitter aversion to polygamy. He had been-wounded in the tenderest point.   POLYGAMY AN EVIL.        303 His affianced bride, within one week of the time appointed for their marriage, jilted him in favor of one of the elders, an old man- of forty years, whose house was already shared by four wives. In consideration of her youth and beauty he promised the fifth a separate-establishment, which, how- ever, she never obtained. ' Another young man with whom I conversed, had suffered severely when a child, from the persecutions of his father's second wife. These women, it seems, are even more cruel and selfish than step-mothers are. reported to be, and the helpless children of their rivals are made the subjects of their concentrated jealousy and rage. This, however, must materially depend on the natural dispositions of the females, and would, by the Mormons at least, be referred to the faults of the individual rather than the system. A highly intelligent young man, a member of the Legisla- tive Assembly, thus expressed himself on the subject of polygamy:  "Polygamy, it must be admitted, is an evil. It is an institution that presses heavily against the best interests of our people. It banishes the best women; it operates against the increase of our population, instead of assisting it, as has been supposed. It prevents the establishment of families, obstructs the proper education of children, and is -the fruitful source oft a vast amount of- vice and misery. Being thus injutious, have the priests and eldelp] any right to fasten it on -our community? Shall the free Mormon people have, their best interests subverted, that these men,  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC8190-00000154"/> 804       THE: USBAND IN UTAH. fallible and erring like ourselves, may have a better chaned to gratify their libidinous desires? What is their sensual gratification compared with the great interests of the com- mon weal? Polygamy was first practised by the priest- hood-by the priesthood it has been supported. They have rendered it fashionable, and if its existence be prolonged to futurity,-it will be through their influence." Another one remarked, in language   almost equally strong:  Our females can &amp;ever take the rank and position among us that properly belong to them, while polygamy is tolerated. Deprived of their legitimate influence as wives and mothers of families, 'they lose that self-respect which is one of the strongest safe-guards of female virtue, become indolent, careless, and reckless,- and It is needless to say that the consequences to the whole community are most disastrous." And again: "The experience of ages may be trusted. Polygamy is a curse, a mildew that has blighted every region it has touched since the creation of the world. It presents no new phase, but from the first to the latest periods it has been destructive of the happiness of individuals, the peace of families, and the welfare of communities." It cannot be believed that many women sit down satisfied under the eisting state of things. Womanly nature must rise at- times 'superior to the influence of priestcraft, and   A PROPHEOCY FOR THE FUTUkc .*       305 though powerless in themselves to effect the change, they will be useful and efficient auxiliaries of reform. Hence, we may confidently expect that the Mormons of a hundred years hence will be very different from those to-day, and that future generations will redeem, in some degree, the errors of the-past and the present. -  .                       ,  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC8190-00000155"/> \ S                                            '               ,             ' J 8                i  1                 ,      ,                                                               EXPLANATORY NOTES.

And verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this. law are these: All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, as- 'sociations, or expectations, that are not -made and entered into, and sealed, by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity, and that too most holy, by revelation and commandment, through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time, on whom this power and the keys of the priesthood are conferred), are of no efficacy, virtue, or force, in and after the resurrection from the dead: for all contracts that are-not made unto this end, have an end when men are dead. 3.

Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me, nor by my word; and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world, and she with him, their covenant and marriage is not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world; therefore, when they are out of the world, they neither marry, nor-are given in mar- riage, but -are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are mninistering servants, to minister for those wlho are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory; for these angelsdid not abide by law, therefore they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without examination, in their saved con- dition, to all eternity, and from henceforth are not Gods, but are angels of God for ever and ever. 5. And again, verily. I say unto you, if a man marry a wife, and make a covenant with her for time, and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me, or by my word, which is my  law, and is not sealed the Holy Spirit of promise, through him whom I have anointed and appointed unto this power, then it is not valid, neither of' force, when they are out of the world, because they are not joined by me, saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are out of the world, it cannot be received there, because the angels and the Gods are appointed there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot, therefore, inherit my glory, for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God.  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC8190-00000159"/> 6. And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by, the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unth them by the 'Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unito whom I have appointed this power, and the keys of this priesthood, and it shall be said unto them, ye shall come iorth in the first resurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection ; and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and pow- ers, dominions, all heights and depths, then shall it be written in the Lamb's Book of Life, that he shall commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood ; and if ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall b, done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity, and shall be of full force wrhen they are out of the world; and they shall pass - by the angels, and the Gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fullness and continuation of the seeds for ever and ever. 7. Then shall they be Gods, because. they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to ever- lasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because things are subject unto them. Then shall they be; gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them. 8.

Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according to my word, and they are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, according to mine appointment, and he or she shall commit, any sin or transgression of the new and everlasting covenant whatever, and all man- ner of blasphemies, and if they commit no murder, wherein they shed innocent blood,-yet they shall come forth in the first resurrection, and enter into their exalta- tion, but they shall be destroyed in the flesh, and shall be delivered unto the buffetings of Satan, unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God. 10. The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall not be forgiven in the world, nor out of the world, is in that ye commit murder, wherein ye shed innocent blood, and assent unto my death, after ye have received my new and everlasting covenant, saith the Lord God; and he that abideth not this law, can in nowise enter into glory, but shall be damned, saith the Lord. ". I am the Lord thy God, and will give unto thee the law of my Holy Priesthood, as was ordained by me, and my Father, before the world was. Abraham received all things, whatsoever he received, by revelation and commandmenit, by my word, saith the Lord, and hath entered into his exaltation, and sitteth upon his throne. 12. Abraham received promises concerning his seed,  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC8190-00000160"/> 6          MORMONISM. and of the fruit of his loins,-from whose loins ye are, viz.: my servant Joseph-wwhich were to continue, Mso long as they were in the world; and as touching Abra- ham and his seed, out of the world, they should con- tinue; both in the world and out of the world should they continue as innumerable as the stars; or, if ye were to count the sand upon the sea-shore, ye could not num- ber them. This promise is yours also, because ye are of Abraham, and the promise was made unto Abraham; and by this law are the continuation of the works of my Father, wherein he glorifieth himself. Go ye, therefore, and do the works of Abraham: enter ye into my law, and ye shall be saved. But if ye enter not into my law, ye cannot receive the promises of my Father, which he made unto Abraham. 13. God commanded Abraham, and Sarah gave Ha- gar to Abraham, to wife. ABnd why did she do it? Because this was the law, and from Hagar sprang many people. This, therefore, was fulfilling, among other things, the promises. Was Abraham therefore, under condemnation? Verily, I say unto you, Nay; for I the Lord, commanded it. Abraham was commanded to offer his son Isaac; nevertheless, it was written, Thou shalt not kill. Abraham, however, did not refuse, and 'it was accounted unto 'him for righteousness. ". Abraham received concubines, and they bare him children, and it was accounted unto him for righteous- ness, because they were given unto him, and he abode in my law: as Isaac also and Jacob did none other things than that .which they were commanded ; and because they did none other things than that which they were commanded, they have entered into their exaltation, according to the promises and sit upon     ,                 .

David's wives and concubines were given unto him, of me, by, the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of'this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me, save in the case of Uriah and his wife ; and therefore, he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world; for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord. 16.

If she be not in the new and everlasting covenant, and she be with another man, she has committed adultery ; and if her husband be with another woman, and he was under -a vow, he hath broken his vow, and-hath committed adultery; and if she hath not committed adultery, but is innocent, and hath not bro- ken her vow, and she knoweth it, and I reveal it unto you, my servant'Joseph, then shall you have power, by the power of my Holy Priesthood, to take her, and give her unto him that hath not committed adultery, but hath  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8190-00000161"/> Mn MONSf. ?IIRzIORIJ-. .'1  been faithful, for he shall be made ruler over many; for 1 have conferred upon you the keys and power of the priesthood, wherein I restore all things, and make known unto you, all things in due time. 17.

And again, verily I say, whomsoever you bless, I will bless; and whomsoever you curse, I will curse, saith the Lord; for I, the Lord, am thy God. 19. And again, verily I say unto you, my servant Joseph, that whatsoever you give on earth, and to whomsoever you give any one on earth, by my word, and according to my law, it shall be visited with bless- ings, and not cursings, and with my power, saith the Lord, and shall be without condemnation on earth, and in heaven; for I am the Lord thy God, and will be with thee even unto the end of the world, and through all eternity : for verily I seal upon you your exaltation, and prepare a throne for you in the kingdom of my Father, with Abraham, your father. Behold, I have seen your sacrifices, and will forgive all your sins; I have seen your sacrifices, in obedience to that which I have told you: go, therefore, and I make a way for your escape, as I accepted the offering of Abraham, of his son Isaac. 20.

And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment, she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law; but if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do all these things for her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him, and multiply him, and give- unto him an hundred fold in this world, of fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns of eternal lives the eternal worlds. And again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses, and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has trespassed against me; and I the Lord thy God will bless her, and multiply her, and make her to rejoice. 22. And again, I say, let not my .servant Joseph put his property out of his hands, lest an enemy come and destroy him, for Satan seeketh to destroy; for I am the Lord thy God, and he is my servant; and behold I and lo, I am with him,-as I was with Abraham thy father, even unto his exaltation and glory. &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8190-00000162"/> 10         MOMONISM. 23.

Let no one, therefore, set on my servant Joseph; for I will justify him; for he shall do the sacrifice which I require at his hands, for his transgressions, saith the Lord your God. 24. And again, as pertaining to the law of the priest- hood: If any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, an-d the first give her consent; and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified ; he' cannot commit adul- tery, for they are given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him, and to none else; and if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law, he cannot commit adultery,for they belong to him ; and they atre given unto him,-therefore is he justified. But if one, or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused,\shall be with another man, she has com- mitted adultery, and shall be destroyed; for they are given unto -him to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my- commandment, and to fulfill the pro- mise which was given by my Father before the founda- tion of the world,; and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my father continued, that,he, may be glorified.  25.

Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for him to receive all things whatsoever I the Lord his God, will give unto him, because she did not believe and administer unto him, according to my word; and she then becomes the transgressor, and he is exempt from the law of Sarah, who administered' unto Abraham according to the law, when I commanded Abraham to take Hagar to wife. And now, as per taing to this law: Verily, verily, I say unto you, 1 will reveal more unto you, hereafter; therefore, let this suffice for the present. Behold, I am Alpha and Omega.

IT is quite unexpected to me, brethren and sisters, to be called upon to address you this forenoon; and still more so, to address you upon the principle which has been named, namely, a plurality of wives. It is rather new ground for me; that is, I have not been in the habit of publicly speaking upon this subject; and it is rather new ground to the inhabitants of the United States, and not only to them, but to a portion of the inhabitants of Europe; a portion of them have not been in the habit of preaching a doctrine of this description; consequently, we shall have to break up new ground. It is well known, however, to the congregation before me, that the latter-day saints have embraced the doc- trine of a plurality of wives, as a part of their religious faith. It is not. as many have supposed, a doctrine embraced by them to gratify the carnal lusts and feelings of man; that is not the object of the doctrine. We shall endeavor to set forth before this enlightened assembly, some of the causes why the Almighty has revealed such adoctrine, and why it is considered a part and portion of our religious faith. And I believe that they   CELESTIAL MARRIAGE.       13 will not, under our present forn of government (I mean the government of the United States), try us for treason for believing and practising our religious notions and ideas. I think, if I am not mistaken, that the Constitution gives the privilege to all the inhabitants of this country, of the free exercise of their religious notions, and the free- domn of their faith, and the practice of it. Then, if it "can be proven to a demonstration, that the latter-day saints- have actually embraced, as a portion of their religion, the doctrine of a plurality of wives, it is consti- tutional. And should there ever be laws enacted by this government to restrict them from the free exercise ,of this part of their religion, such laws must be uncon- stitutional. But, says the objector, we cannot see how this doc- trine can be embraced as a matter of religion and faith; we can hardly conceive how it can be embraced only as a kind of domestic concern, something that pertains to domestic pleasures, in no way connected with religion. In reply, we will show you that it is incorporated as a part of our religion, and necessary for our exaltation to the fullness of the Lord's glory in the eternal world. Would you like to know the reasons? Before we get through, we will endeavor to tell you why we consider it an essential doctrine to glory and exaltation, to our fullness of happiness in the wprld to come. We will first make a few preliminary remarks in regard to the existence of man, to his first existence in his first estate; and then say something in relation to his present state, and the bearing which it has upon his next or future state. The "Mormons" have .a peculiar doctrine in regara to our pre-existence, different from the views of the  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8190-00000164"/> "  9      MORMONISM. Christian world. so called, who -do not believe that man had a pre-existence. It is believed, by the religious world, that man, both body and' spirit, begins to live about the time that he is born into this world, or a little before; that then is the beginning of life. They believe that the Lord, by a direct act of creation, formed, in the first place, man out of the dust of the ground; and they believe that man is possessed of both body and spirit, by the union of which he became a living creature. Sup- pose we admit this doctrine concerning the formation of the body from the dust, then how was the spirit formed? Why, says one, we suppose it was made by a direct act of creation, by the Almighty Himself; that He moulded the spirit of man, formed and finished it in a proper like- ness to inhabit the tabernacle He had made out of the dust. Have you any account of this in the Bible? Do the Scriptures declare that the spirit was formed at the time the tabernacle was made? No. All the tabernacles of the children of men that were ever formed, from remote generations, from the days of- Adam to this time, have been formed out of the earth. We are of the earth, earthy. The tabernacle has been organized according to certain principles and laws of organization, with bones, and flesh, and sinews, and skin. Now, where do you suppose all these tabernacles got their spirits? Does the Lord make a new spirit every time a tabernacle is made? If so, the work of creation, according to the belief of Christendom, did not cease on the seventh day. If we admit their views, the Lord must be continually making spirits to inhabit all' the tabernacles of the children of men; He must make something like one thousand millions of spirits every century; He must be   CELESTIAL MARRIAGE.     . 15 working at it every day, for there are. many hundreds of individuals being born into the world every day. Does the Lord create a new spirit every time a new tabernacle comes into the world? That does not look reasonable, nor God-like. But how is it, you inquire? Why the fact is, that being that animates this body, that gives life and en- ergy, and power to move, to act, and o think: that be- ing that dwells within this tabernacle is much older than what the tabernacle is. That spirit that now dwells within each man, and each woman, of this vast assembly of people, is more than a thousand years old, and I would venture to say, that it is more than five thousand years old. But how was it made? when was it made? and by -whom was it made? If our spirits existed thousands of years ago-if they began to exist-if there were a be- ginning to their organization, by what process was this organization carried on? Through what medium, and by what system of laws? Was it by a direct creation of the Almighty? Or were we framed according to a certain system of laws, in the same manner as our tabernacles . If we were to reason from analogy-if we admit analogical reasoning in the question, what would we say? We should say, that our spirits were formed by  generation, the same as the body or tabernacle of flesh and bones. But what says revelation upon the subject? We will see whether revelation and analogy will agree. We read of a certain time 'when the corner stones of the earth were laid, and the foundations thereof were made sure-of a certain time when the Lord began to erect this beautiful and glorious habitation, the earth; then they had a time of joy. I do not know whether  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8190-00000165"/> 16         - aORMONI'SM. they had instruments of music, or whether they were engaged in the dance; but one thing is certain, they had great joy, and the heavens resounded with their shouts; yea, the Lord told Job, that all the sons of God shouted for joy, and the morning stars sang together, when the foundations of this globe were laid. The sows of God, recollect, shguted for joy, because there was a beautiful habitation being built, so that they could get tabernacles, and dwell thereon; they ex- pected the time-they looked forward to the period; and it was joyful to them to reflect, that the creation was about being formed, the corner stone of it was laid, on which they might, in their times, and in their seasons, and in their generations, go forth and receive, tabernacles for their spirits to dwell in. Do you bring it -home to yourselves, brethren: and sisters? Do you realize that you and I were there?  Can you bring it to your minds that you and I were among that happy number that shouted for joy when this creation was made? Says one, I don't recollect it. No wonder I for your recollection is taken from you, because you are in a tabernacle that is earthly; and all this is right and necessary. The same is written of Jesus Christ himself, who had to descend below all things. Though he had wisdom to assist in the organization -of this world; though it was through him, as the great leader of all these sons of God, the earth was framed, and framed toop, by the assistance of all his younger brethren--yet we finid, with all that great and mighty power he possessed, and the great .arid superior wisdom that was in his bosom, that after all his judgment had to be taken away; in  his humiliation, his reason, his intelli- gence, his knowledge,. and the power that he was for- f' o    CELESTIAL MARRIAGE.       17 merly in possession of, vanished from him as he entered into the infant tabernacle. He was obliged to begin down at the lowest principles of knowledge, and ascend upward by degrees, receiving grace for grace, truth for truth, knowledge for knowledge, until he was filled with all the fullness of the Father, and was capable of ruling, governing, and controlling all things, having ascended above all things. Just so with us; we that once lifted up our united voices as sons and daughters of God, and shouted for joy at the laying of the foundation of this earth, have come here and taken tabernacles, after the pattern of our elder brother: and in our humiliation-- for it is humiliation to be deprived of knowledge we once had, and the -power we once enjoyed-in our hu- miliation, just like our elder brother, our judgument is taken away. Do we not read also in the Bible, that God is the Father of our spirits?  We have ascertained that we have had a previous ex- istence. We find that Solomon, that wise man, says that when the body returns to the dust, the spirit re- turns to God who gave it. Now all of this congrega- tion very well know, that if we never existed there, we could not return there. I could not return to Califor- nia. Why?   Because I never have been there. If you never were with the Father, the same as Jesus was before the foundation of the world, you never could return there, any more than I could to the West Indies, where I have never been. ' But if we have once been there, then we canu see the force of the saying of the wise man, that the spirit returns to God who gave it --it goes back where it oncte was. Much more evidence might be derived in relation to this subject, even from the English translation of the -  ,      /  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8190-00000166"/> 1i8    dn    ofeeslO IS . Bible; but I do not feel disposed to dwell too long upon  any particular testimony; suffice it to say, that the a Prophet Joseph Slnitl's translation of the fore part of the book of Genesis is in print, and is exceedingly plain upon this matter. In this inspired translation we find the pre-existence of man clearly laid down, and that the spirits of all men, male and female, did have an'exis- tence, before man was formed out of the dust of the ,ground. But who was their Father? I have already quoted a saying that God is the Father of our spirits. In one sense of the word, there are more Gods than one; and in another sense there is but one God. The scriptures speak of more Gods than one. Moses was called a God to Aaron, in plain terms; and our Saviour, when speaking upon this subject, says, "If the Scrip- tures called them Gods unto whom the word of God came, why is it that you should seek to persecute me, a nd kill me, because I testify that I am the son of God?" This in substance was the word of our Saviour; those to whom the word of God, came, are called Gods, accord- ing to his testimony. All these beings of course are one, the same as the Father and the Son are one. 'The Son is called God, and so is the Father, and in some places the Holy Ghost is called God. They are one in power, in wisdom, in knowledge, and in the inheritance of celestial glory; they are one in theirs works; they possess all things, and all things are subject to them; (L they act in unison; and if one has power to become the Father of spirits, so has another; if one God can pro- pagate his species, and raise up spirits after his own image and likeness, and calt them his sons and daugh- ters, so can all other Gods that become like him, do the' same thing; consequently, there will be many Fathers,   CELESTIAL MARRIAGE.       19 and there will be many families, and .many sons and daughters; and they will be the children of those glo- rified celestial beings that are counted worthy to be Gods. Here let me bring for the satisfaction of the saints, the testimony of the vision given to our Prophet and Revelator Josephl Smith, and Sidney Rigdon, on the 25th day of February, 1832. They were engaged in translating, the New Testament, by inspiration; and 'while engaged in this great' work, they calne to the 29th verse of the 5th chapter of John, which was given to them in these words-" they who have done good, in the resurrection of thr just; and they who have done evil in the resurrection of the unjust." This being given in different words from the English translation, caused them to marvel and wonder; and they lifted up their hearts in prayer to God, that He would show them why it was that this should be given to them in a differ- ent manner; and behold, the visions of heaven opened before them. They gazed upon the eternal worlds, and saw things before this world was made. They saw the spiritual creation who were to come forth and take upon themselves bodies; and they saw things as they. are- to be in the future; they saw the celestial, terrestrial, .and telestial worlds, as well as the sufferings of the ungodly; all passed betore him in this. great and glorious vision. And while they were yet gazing upon things as they were before the-world was made, they were commanded to write, saying, ".this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him, that he lives; for we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father; that by him, and through him, and of him, the  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8190-00000167"/> go20          -iSO IrsrM'. worlds are and were created; .and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God." Notice this last expression, " the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and, daughters unto God," (meaning the different worlds that have been created and made) Notice, this does not say, that God, whom we serve and worship, was actually the Father Himself, in His own person, of all these sons and daughters of the different worlds; but they " are begotten sons and} daughters unto God;" that is, begotten by those who-are made like Him, after His image, and in His likeness;' they begat sons and daughters, and begat, them  unto' God, to inhabit these different worlds we have been speaking of. But more of this, if we have time, before we get through. We now come to the second division of our subject, or the entrance of these spirits upon their second estate, or their birth and existence in mortal taberna- cles. We ,are told that among this great family of spirits, some were more noble and great than others, having more intelligence. Where do you read that? says one. Out of the Book of Abraham, translated from the Egyptian papyrus by the Prophet Joseph  Smith.  Among the great and numerous family -of spirits-" the begotten sons and daughters of God "--there are some  more intelligent than others; and the Lord showed unto Abraham " the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones." And God said to Abraham, "thou \art one of them,   thou wast chosen before thou wast born." Abraham was chosen before he was born. Here then, is knowledge, if we had time to. notice it, upon the do-  ge, 1         it, upon te doc'-   CELESTIAL MAB RRIAGE.  trine of election. However, Imtay just remark, it does not mean unconditional election to eternal life of a cer- tain class, and the, rest doomed to eternal damnation. Suffice it to say, that Abraham and many others of the great and'noble ones in the family of spirits, were cho- sen 'before they were borin, for certain purposes, to bring about certain works, to have the privilege of coming upon the, stage of action, among the host of men, in favorable circumstances. Some came through good and holy parentages, to fulfill certain things the Lord decreed should come to pass, from before the foundations of the world. The Lord has ordained that these spirits should come here and take tabernacles by a certain law, through a certain channel; and that law is the law of marriage. There are a great many things that I will pass by; I perceive that if I were to, touch upon all these princi- ples, the time allotted for this discourse would be too short, therefore I am under the necessity of passing by many things in relation to these spirits in their first estate, and the laws that governed them there, and come to their second estate. The Lord ordained marriage between male and female as a law through which spirits should come here and take tabernacles, and enter into the second state of exis- tence. The Lord Himself solemnized the first marriage pertaining to this globe, and pertaining to flesh and bones here upon this earth. I do not say pertaining to mortality; for when the first marriage was celebrated, no mortality ~as there. The first marriage that we have any account of, was between two immortal beings --old father Adam and old mother Eve; they were immortal beings; deathhad no dominion, no power &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8190-00000168"/> 22         MORMONISM. over them; they were capable of enduring for ever and ever, in their organization. Had they fulfilled the law, and kept within certain conditions and bounds, their tabernacles would never have been seized by death; death entered entirely by sin, and sin alone. This mar- riage was celebrated between two immortal beings. For how long  Until death? No. That was entirely out of the question; there could have been no such thing in the ceremony.  What would you consider, my hearers, if a marriage was to be celebrated between two beings not subject to death? Would you consider them joined together for a certain number of years, and that then all their cove- nants were to cease for ever, and the marriage contract be dissolved? Would it look reasonable and consistent?- No. Every heart would say that the wolrk of God is perfect in and of itself, and inasmuch as sin had not brought imperfection upon the globe, what God joined together could not be dissolved, and destroyed, and torn asunder by any power beneath the celestial world, con- sequently it was eternal; the ordinance of union was eternal; the sealing of the great Jehovah upon Adam and Eve was eternal in its nature, and was never insti- tuted for the purpose of being overthrown and brought to an end. It is known that the '.'Mormons " are a peculiar people about marriage; we believe in marry- ing, not only foria time, bud for all eternity. This is a curious idea, says one, to be married for all eternity. It is not. curious at all; for when we come to examine the Scriptures, we find that the very first example set for the whole human family, as a pattern instituted for us ' to follow, was not instituted until death for death had no dominion at that time; but it was an eternal bless ,    I     OCwFT.3TA aL r MaBIA .     23 ing, pronounced upon our first-parents  I  have not time to explain further the marriage of Adam and Eve, but will pass on to their posterity.  It -is true, atthaey became, fallen, but there is a redemption. But some may consider that the redemp- tion only redeemed us in part, that is, merely from someo of the effects of the fall. But this is not the case; every man and woman must see at once that a redemption must include a complete restoration of all the privileges lost by the fall. Suppose, then, that the fall-was of such a nature as to dissolve the marriage covenant, by death--which is not necesslry to admit, for the covenant was sealed previous to the fall, and we hlave no account that it was dissolved --but suppose tiffs was the case, would not the redemp- tion be equally broad as the fall, to restore the posterity of Adain back to that which they lost.  And if Adam and Eve were married for all eternity, the ceremony was an everlasting ordinance, that they twain should be one flesh for ever. If you and I should ever be account- ed worthy to be restored back fromn our fallen and degraded condition to the/privileges enjoyed before the fall, slhould we not have n everlasting marriage seal, as it was with our first .progenitors? If' we had no other reasons in all the Bible, thh would-be sufficient to settle the case at once in the mind of every reflecting man and woman, that inasmuch as the fall of man has taken away any privileges in regard  to he union of male and female, these privileges must be restored in the redemption of man, or else it is not complete. What is the object of this union a is the next question. We are told the olbject of it: it is clearly expressed; for, says the Lord unto the male and female, I command  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8190-00000169"/> you to multip, and repenishthe earth. And, nasmuch you to multiply and replenish the earth. Agnd, inasmuch as we have proved that the marriage ordinance was eternal in its nature, previous to the fall, if we are restored back to what was lost by the fall, we are restor- ed for the purpose'of carrying onit the commandment gven before the fall, namely, to multiply and replenish the earth, Does it say, continue to multiply for a few years, and then the marriage contract must cease, and there shall be no further opportunity of carrying out this command, but it shall have: an end? No, there is nothing specified of this kind; but the fall has brought in disunion through death; it is riot a part of the original plan; consequently, when male and female are restored from  the fall, by virtue of the everlasting and eternal covenant of marriage, they will continue to increase and , multiply to all ages of eternity, to raise up beings after their own order, and in their own likeness and image, germs of intelligence, that are destined, in their times and seasons, to become not only sons of God, but gods themselves.. This acount s for the many worldswe heard Elder Grant speaking about yesterday afternoon. The peopling of worlds, or an endless increase, even of one family, would require an endless increase of worlds; and if one family were to be united in theeternal-covenant of marriage, to fulfill that great commandment, to multiply his species, and propagate thein, and if there be no end to the increase of his posterity, it would call for an end- less increase of new worlds. And if one family calls for this, what would innumerable millions of families call for? They would call for- as many worlds as have already been discovered by the telescope; yea, the number must be multiplied to'inlfinity in order that   CELESTIAL MA RRIAGF..      25 there may be room for the inheritance of the sons and daughters of the Gods. Do you, begin to understand how these worlds get their inhabitants? Have you learned that the sons and daughters of God before me this day, are His offspring -made after His own image ; that they are to multiply their species until they become innumerable. Let us say a few words, before we leave this part of the subject, on the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The promises were, Lift up your eyes, and behold the stars; so thy seed shall be, as numberless as the stars. What else did He promise? Go to the sea- shore, and look at the ocean of sand, and behold the smiallness of -the particles thereof, and then realize that your seed shalU be as numberless as the sands. Now let us take this into consideration. How large a bulk of sand would it take to make as many inhabitants as there Are now upon the earth? In about one cubic foot of sand, reckoning the grains of a certain size, there would be a thousand million particles. Now that is about the estimated population of our globe. If our earth were to continue 8,000 years, or eighty centuries, with an aver- age population of one thousand millions per century, then three cubic yards of sand would contain a greater nuimber of particles than the whole population of the globe, from the beginning, until the measure of the inhabitants of this creation is complete. If men then cdase to multiply, .where is the promise made to Abra- ham '-Is it fulfilled . No. If that is the end of his increase, behold, the Lord's promise is not fulfilled. For the amount of sand representing his seed, might all be drawn in a one-horse cart; and yet the Lord said to Abraham, thy seed ahall be as numerous as the sand   &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8190-00000170"/> 26    .     MORMONISM. upon the sea-shore; that is, to carry out the idea in full, it was to be endless; and therefore, there must be an infinity of worlds, for their residence. We cannot comprehend infinity. But suffice it to. say, if all the sands on the sea-shore were numbered, says the Prophet Enoch, and then all the particles of the earth besides, and then the particles of millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to all thy creations; and yet thou art there,' and thly bosom is there; and thy curtains are stretched out still. This gives plenty of room for the fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham, and enough to spare for the fulfillment of similar promises, to all his seed.' We read that those who do the works of Abraham, are to be blessed with the blessing of Abraham. Have you not, in the ordinances of this last dispensation, had- the blessings of Abraham pronounced upon your heads? O yes, you sav, I well recollect, since God-lhas restored the everlasting Priesthood, that by a certain ordinance these blessings were placed upon our heads-the bless- ings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Why, says one, I never thought of it in this light before. Why did you not think of it? Why not look upon Abraham's bless- ings' as your own, for the Lord blessed him with a promise of seed as numerous as the sand upon the sea- shore; so will you be blessed, or else you will not inherit the blessings of Abraham. How did Abraham manage- to get a foundation laid for this mighty kingdom? Was he to accomplish it all through one wifea . No. Sarah gave a certain woman to him whose name was Hagar, and by her a seed was to be raised up unto him. Is this all? No. We read of his wife Keturah, and also of a plurality of'wives and   CELESTIAL MBRRIAGE.       2Y concubines, which he had, from whom he raised up many sons. Here, then, was a foundation laid for the fulfillment of' the great and grand promise concerning the multiplicity of his seed. It would have been rather a slow process, if Abraham had been confined to one wife, like some of those narrow, contracted nations of modern Christianity. I think there is only about one-fifth of the population of the globe, that believe in the one-wife system; the other four-fifths believe in the doctrine of a plurality of wives. They have had it handed down from time immemorial, and are not half so narrow and contracted in their minds as some of the nations of Europe and America, who have done away with the promises, and deprived them- selves o: the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The nations dotnot know anything about the blessings of Abraham; and even those who have only one wife, cannot get rid of their covetousness, and get their little hearts large enough to share their property with a numerous family; they are so penurious, and so narrow and contracted in their feelings, that they take every possible care not to have their families large; they do not know what is in the future, nor what blessings they are depriving themselves of, because of the traditions of their fathers; they do not know that a man's posterity, in the eternal worlds, are to constitute his glory, his kingdom, and dominion. Here, then, we perceive, just from this one principle, reasoning from the blessings of Abraham alone, the necessity-if 'we would partake of the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob--of doing their works; and he that will not do the works of Abraham, and walk in his footsteps, will be deprived of his blessings.  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8190-00000171"/> 28         1IMORMONISM. Again, let us look at Sarah's peculiar position in regard to Abraham. She understood the whole matter; she knew that, unless seed was raised up to Abraham, he would come short of his glory; and she understood the promise of the Lord, and longed for Abraham to have seed. And when she saw that she was old, and fearing that she should not have the privilege of raising up seed, she gave to Abraham, Hagar. Would Gelitile Christendom do such things now-a-days? O no; they would consider it- enough to send a man to an endless hell of fire and brimstone. Why? Because tradition has instilled this in their minds as a dreadful, awful thing. It matters not to them how corrupt they are in female prostitution, if they are lawfully married to only one wife; but it would be considered an awful thing by them to raise up a posterity from more than one wife; this would- be wrong indeed ; but to go into a brothel, and there debauch themselves in the lowest haunts of degradation all the days of their lives, they consider only a trifling thing; nay, they can even license such institutions in Christian nations, and it all passes off very well. That is tradition; and their posterity have been fos- tered and brought up in the footsteps of wickedness. This is death, as it stalks abroad among the great and popular, cities of Europe and America. Do you find such haunts of prostitution, degradation, and misery here, in the cities of the mountains? No. Were such things in our midst, we should feel indignant enough to see that such persons be blotted out of the. page of existence. These would be the feelings of this 'community.   .              .   CELESTIAL MARRIAGE.      29 Look upon those who committed such iniquity in Israel, in ancient days; every man and woman who committed adultery were put to death. , I do not say that this people are going to do this; but I will tell you what we believe-we believe it ought to be done. Whoredom, adultery, and fornication, have cursed the nations of the earth for many generations, and are increasing fearfully upon the community; but they must be entirely done away from those who call themselves the people of God; if they are not, woe! woe! be unto them, also; for'" thus saith the Lord God Almighty," in the Book of Mormons, "Woe unto them that commit whoredoms, for, they shall be thrust down to hell!" There is no getting away, from it. Such things will not be allowed in this community; and such characters will find that the time will come, that God, whose eyes ar'e upon all the children of mnen, and who discerneth the things that are done in secret, will bring their acts'to light; and they will be made an example before the people; and shame and infamy will cleave to their pos- terity after them, unto the third and fourth generation of them that repent not. How is this to be prevented? for we have got a fallen nature to grapple with. It is to be prevented in the way the Lord devised in ancient times; that is, by giving to His faithful servants a plurality of wives, by which a numerous and faithful posterity can be raised up, and taught in the principles of righteousness and truth; and then, after they fully understand those prin- ciples that were given to the ancient Patriarchs, if they keep not the law of God, but commit adultery, and transgressions of this kind, let their names be blotted - "*  \ !     - " "  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8190-00000172"/> 30         MORMONISM. out from under heave n;that they may have no place among the people of God. But again, there is another reason'why this plurality should exist among the latter-day saints. I have already given you one reason, and that is, that you might inherit the blessings and promises made to Abra-. ham, Isaac, and Jacob, and receive a continuation of your posterity, that they may become as numerous as the sand upon the sea-shore. There is another reason, and a good one, too. What do you suppose it is? I will tell you; and it will appear reasonable to every man and woman of a reflecting mind. Do we not be- lieve, as the Scriptures have told us, that the wicked nations of the earth are doomed to destruction? Yes, we believe it. Do we not also believe, as the Prophets have foretold, concerning the last days, as well as what the new revelations have said upon the subject, that darkness prevails upon the earth, and gross darkness upon the minds of the people; and not only this, but that all flesh has corrupted its way upon the face of the earth; that is, that all nations, speaking of them as na- tions, have corrupted themselves before the Most- High God, by their wickedness, whoredoms,' idolatries, abomi- nations, adulteries, and all other kind of wickedness? And we furthermore believe, that according to the Jewish prophets, as well as the book of Mormon, and modern revelations given in the book of doctrine and cove- nants, that the sword -of the vengeance of the Almighty is already unsheathed, and stretched out, and will no more be put back into the scabbard until it falls upon the head of the nations until they are destroyed, except they repent. What else do we believe? We believe that God is gathering out from among these nations   CELESTIAL MARRIAGE.       31 those who will hearken to his voice, and receive the proclamation of the Gospel, to establish them as a peo- ple alone, by themselves, where they can be instructed in the right way, and brought to a knowledge of the truth. Very well: if this be the case, that the right- eous are gathering out, and are still being gathered from among the nations, and being planted by themselves, one thing is certain-that that people are better calcu- lated to bring up their children in the right way, than any other under the whole heavens. Oh yes, says one, if that is the case--if you are the people the ancient Prophets have spoken of, if you are tfhe people that are guided by tihe Lord, if you are under the influence, power, and guidance of the Almighty, you must be the best people under heaven, to dictate the young mind: but what has that to do with the plurality of wives? I will tell you. I have alreadyr told you that the spirits of men and women, all had a previous existence, thou- sanlds of years ago, in the heavens, in the presence of God; and I have already told you that among them are many spirits that are more noble, more intelligent than others, that were called the great and mighty ones, re- served until the dispensation of the fullness of times, to come forth upon the face of the earth, through a noble parentage that shall train their young and tender minds in the truths of eternity, that they may grow up in the Lord, and be strong in the power of His might, be clothed upon with His glory, be filled with exceeding great faith; that the visions of eternity may be opened to their minds; that they may be prophets, priests, and kings to the Most High God.  Do you believe, says one, that they are reserved until the last dispensation, for such a noble purpose Yes; and among the Saints  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8190-00000173"/> 32 M- ORMONISIM.  is the most likely place for these spirits to take their tabernacles, through a just and righteous parentage. They are to be sent to that people that are the most righteous of any other people upon the earth ;t there to be trained up properly, according to their nobility and intelligence, and according to the laws which the Lord ordained before they were born. 'This is the reason why the Lord is sending them' here, brethren and sisters; they are appointed to come and take their bodies here, that in their generations they may be raised up among the righteous. The Lord has not kept them in store for five or six thousand years past, and kept them waiting for their bodies all this ltime, to send them among the Hottentots, the African negroes, the idolatrous Hindoos, or any other of -the fallen nations that dwell upon the face of this earth. They are not kept in reserve in order to come forth to receive such a degraded parent- age upon the earth; no, the Lord is not such a being; His justice, goodness, and mercy will be magnified towards those who were chosen before they were born; and they long to come, and they will come, among the Saints of the living God; this would be their highest pleasure and joy, to know that they could have the privilege of being born of such noble parentage. Then is it not reasonable, and consistent that the Lord should say unto His faithful and chosen servants, that had proved themselves before Him all the day long, that had been ready and willing to do whatso- ever His will required them to perform;--take unto yourselves more wives, like- unto the patriarchs, Abra- ham, Isaac, and Jacob, of old-like those who lived in ancient times, who walked in my footsteps, and kept my commands? Why should they not do this? Sup-   OELESTIAL MARRIAGE.       U0 ose the Lord should answer this question, would Be ot say, I have here in reserve, noble spirits, that have een waiting for thousands of years, to come forth in he fullness of times, and which Hdesigned should conic orth through these my faithful and chosen servants, for know they will do my will, and they will teach their hildren after them to do it? Would not this be the ,ubstance of the language, if the Lord should give us an answer upon this subject  But then another question will arise; how are these things to be conducted. Are they to be left at ran- dom. Is every servant of God at liberty to run here and there, seeking out the-daughters of men as wives unto themselves without any restriction, law, or condi- tion!. No. We find these things were restricted in ancient times. Do you not recollect the circumstance of the Prophet Nathan's coming to David. He came to reprove him for certain disobedience, and told him about the wives he had lost through it; that the Lord Would give them to another; and he told him, if he had been faithful, that the Lord would have given him still more, if he had only asked for them. Nathan the Prophet, in relationto David, was the man that held the keys concerning this matter in ancient days; and it was governed by' the strictest laws. So in these days; let me announce to this congrega- tion, that there is but one man in all the world, at the same time, who can hold the keys of this matter; but one man Was power to turn the key to inquire of the Lord, and 0o saywhether I, or these my brethren, or any ofthe rest of this congregation, or the Saints upon the face of the whole earth, may have this blessing of ^^^e?^^^^^  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8190-00000174"/> 34          AIs .     , Abraham conferred upon them; he holds the keys of these matters now, the same as Nathan, in his day. But, salys one, how have you obtained this informa- tion By new revelation. Wllen was'it given, and to whom. It was given to our Prophet, Seer, and' Reve- lator, Joseph Smith, on the 12th day of July, 1843; only about eleven monthst before he was martyred for the testimony of Jesus. He held the keys of these matters; he had the right to inquire of the Lord; and the Lord has set bounds and restrictions to these things; he has told us in that revelation, that only one man can hold these keys upon. the earth at the same time; and they belong to that man who stands at the head to preside over all the affairs of the' church and kingdom of God in the last days. They are the sealing keys of power, or in other words, of Elijah, having been committed and restored to the earth by Elijah, the prophet, who held many keys, among which were-the keys of sealing, to bind the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the chil- dren to the fathers; together with all the other sealing keys and powers, pertaining to the last dispensation. They were committed by that angel who administered in the Mirtland Temple, and spoke unto Joseph the prophet, at the time of the endowments in that house. Now, let us enquire, what will become of those indi- viduals who have this law taught unto them in plainness if they reject it? [A voice in the stand, "they will be damned."] I will tell you: they will be damned, saith the Lord God Almighty; in the revelation he has given. Why? Because where much is given, much is required; where there is great knowledge unfolded for the exalta-   CLETSTIAL MARRIAGE.      35 tion, glory, and happiness of the sons and daughters of God, if they close up their hearts, if they reject the testimony of Hig word, and willnot give heed to the principles he has ordained for their good, they are worthy of damnation, aud the Lord- has said they shall be damned. This was the word of the Lord to His servant Joseph the prophet himself. With all the knowledge and light he had, he must comply with it, or, says the Lord unto him, you shall be damned; and the same is true in regard to all those who reject these things. What else have we heard from our President? He has related to us that there are some damnations that are eternal in their nature; while others are but for a certain period, they will have an end, they will not, receive a restoration to their former privileges, but a deliverance from certain punishments: and instead of being restored to all the privileges pertaining to man previous to the fall, they will only be permitted to enjoy a certain grade of happiness, not a full restora- tion. Let us inquire after those who are to be damned, admitting they will- be redeemed, which they will be, unless they have sinned against the Holy Ghost. They will be redeemed, but what will it be to? Will it be to exaltation, and to a fullness of glory? Will it be to become sons of God, or Gods to reign upon thrones, and multiply their posterity, and 'reign over them as kings? No, it will not. They have lost that exalted privilege for ever; though they may, after having been punished for long periods, escape -by the skin of their teeth; but no kingdom will be conferred upon them? What will be their condition? I will tell you what revelation says, not only concerning them that reject these things,  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8190-00000175"/> 36      hlC onMoXIBsr.        - but concerning those that through their carelessness, 6r want of faith, or something elseohave failed to have their marriages sealed for time and for all eternity; thlose that do not do these things, o80 as to have the same ordinances sealed' upon their heads by divine authority, as was upon the head of old Father Adam--if they fail to do it through wickedness, through their ungodlines they also will never have the privilege of possessin that which is- possessed by the Gods that hold the keys of power, of coming up to the thrones of their exalta- tion, and receiving their kingdoms. Why? Because, saith the Lord, all oaths, all covenants, and all agree- ments, etc., that have beeq made by man, and not by me, and by the authority I have established, shall cease when death shall separate the parties; that is the end; that is the cessation, they go no further; and such a person cannot comne up in the morning of the resurrec- tion, and say, Behold, I claim you as my wife; you are mine; I  married you in the other world before death therefore you are mine: he cannot say this. Why, Because he never married that person for eternity. Suppose they should enter into covenant and agree- ment, and conclude between themselves to live together to all eternity, and never have it sealed by the Lord's sealing power, by the holy priesthood, would they have any claim on each other in the morning of the resurrec- tion?  No; it would not be valid nor legal, and the I Lord would say, It was not byme; your covenants were not sealed -on the earth, and therefore they are not sealed in the heavens; they are not recorded on my book; thev ae not to be fbund in the records that are in the archives of eternity; therefore, the blessings you  might have had; are not for you to enjoy. What will   CELESTIAL MABRIAGE.      8- be their condition? The Lord has told us. He says thse are angels; because they keep not this law, they shall be ministering servants unto those who are worthy of obtaining a more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; wherefore, saith the Lord, they shall -remain' singly and separately in their saved condition, and shall not have power to enlarge themselves, and thus shall they remain forever and ever. Here, then, you can read their history; they are not Gods, but they are angels or servants to the Gods. There is a difference -between the two classes; the Gods are exalted; they hold keys of power; are made kings and priests; and this power is conferred upon them in time, by the everlasting priesthood, to 'hold a kingdom in eternity that shall never be taken from them worlds without end; and they will propagate their species. They are not servants; for one God is not to -be'a ser- vant to another God ; they are not angels; and this is the reason why Paul s'aid, know ye not, brethren, that we shall judge angels? Angels are inferior to the saints who are exalted as kings. These angels who are to be judged, and to become servants to the Gods, did not keep the law, therefore, though they are saved, they are to be servants to those who are in a higher condition.

AN ADDRESS DELIVERED BY PRESIDENT BRIGHAM YOUNG THE TABERNACLE, GREAT SALT LAKE CITY'. I wish to say a few words to the latter-day saints this morning, as there seems to be considerable excitement in the feelings of the people, and many inquiring what will be the result of the present Indian difficulties. I will give you my testimony, as far as I have one on ;he subject, concerning these difficulties in this territory, lorth and south, pertaining to our brethren, the Laman- tes. My testimony to all is--rr Is RIGHT, and perfectly calculated, like all other providences of the Lord, of the Like nature, to chasten this people until they are willing to take counsel. They will purify and sanctify the Saints, and prepare the wicked for their doom. There has nothing strange and uncommon to man, yet )ccurred; nothing has yet happened out of the ordinary providences of the Lord. Thiese common dealings of our treat Head with His people have been manifested from lays of old, in blessings and chastisements Wars, com- notions, tumults, strife, nation contending against na- ioin, and people against people, have all' been governed ind controlled by :Ttim whose right-it is to'control such matters.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8190-00000177"/> 40         MORMONISM. Among wicked nations, or among Saints, among the ancient Israelites, Philistines and Romans, the hand of the Lord Was felt; in short, all the powers that have been upon the earth, have been dictated, governed, controlled, and the final issue of their existence has been brought to pass, according to the wisdom of the Almighty. Then my testimony is, IT IS ALL RIGHT. There seems to be some excitement among the people, and fears are arising in the breasts of many, as to the- general safety. Some person has been shot at by the In- dians, or some Indians were seen in a hostile condition.- And away go messengers to report to head quarters, saying, "What shall we do? for we cannot tell, but we shall all be killed by- them; they have stolen our horses and driven off some cattle, which has created a great ex- citement in our settlement," etc; when, perhaps to-mor- row, the very Indians who have committed these depre- dations will come and say, How do you do , We are friendly, cannot you give us some 6 ChitcUp . "? They will shake hands, and appear as though it were impos- sible for them to be guilty of another hostility. And what is the next move? Why, our wise men, the elders of Israel, are either so fluctuating in their feelings, so unstable in- their ways, or so ignorant of the Indian character, 'that the least mark of friendship manifested by these treacherous red men, will lull all their fears, throw them entirely off their guard, saying, "It is all right; wife, take care of the stock, for I am going to the canon for a load of wood." Away he goes, without a gun or a pistol to defend himself in case of an attack from some Indian or In- * Indian language for something to eat.   INDIAN HOSTILITIES AND TREACHE Y.   41 dians, to rob him of his cattle and perhaps his life. Herds of cattle are driven upon the range, thefeeligs of the people are divested of all fear by this little show of Indian friendship, and their hearts are at peace with all mankind. They lie down to sleep at night with the doors of their houses open, and in many instances with no way to close them if they were willing, only by means of hanging up a blanket. Thus they go to sleep with their gans unloaded, and entirely without any means of defence, in case they should be attacked in the night. On the other hand, they no sooner discover an Indian in an hostile attitude, than the hue and cry is "We shall all ben mrdered immediately." That is the kind of stability, the kind of unshaken self-command, the style of generalship and wisdom manifested by el- ders in Israel. To-day all are in arms, war is on hand; "we are going to be destroyed, or to fight our way through," is in every mouth. To-morrow all is peace, and every man turns to his own way, wherever the com- mon avocations of life call him. No concern is felt as to protection in the future, but " all is right, all is safety, there is no fear of any further trouble," is the language of people's thoughts, and they lie down to sleep in a false security, to be murdered in the night by their ene- mies, if they are disposed to murder them. I can tell you one thing with regard to excitement and war. You may take Israel here, as a community, with all their experience, and with all they have passed through in the shape of war, and difficulties of various kinds, and these wild Indians are actually wiser in their generation in the art of war than this people are. They lay better plans, display greater skill, and are steadier in their feelings. They are not so easily excited, and  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8190-00000178"/> ,42 MORMONISM. when excited, are not so easily allayed, as the men who have come, to inhabit these mountains, from where they have been trained and educated in the civilization of modern nations. You may not believe this assertion; it is, however, no matter whether you do or do not, the fact remains unaltered, as well as the conviction of my own mind regarding it. I have been frequently asked, what is going to be the result of these troubles? I answer-the result will be good. What did you hear, you who have come to these valleys within the last few years, previous to your leav- ing your native country? You heard that all was peace and safety among the Saints in these regions; that the earth yielded in her strength, giving an abundance of food; and that this was a splendid country to raise stock. Your determination was then formed to go up to the valleys of the mountains, where you could enjoy peace and quiet, and follow the avocations of life- undis- turbed. When the people arrive here, many of them come to me and say, a Brother Biigham, can we go here or there to get us farms? Shall we enter into this or that speculation? We have been very poor, and we want to make some money, or we want the privilege of taking with us a few families to make a settlement in this or that distant valley." If I inquire why they can- not stay .here, their answer is, "because there is no room, the land is chiefly takenup, and we have a considera- ble stock of cattle, we want to go where we can have plenty of range for our stock, where we can mount our horses; and ride over the prairies, and say, I am lord of all I survey. We do not wish to be disturbed, in any way, nor to be asked to pay tithing, to work upon the roads, nor pay territorial tax, but we wish all the time to   INDIAN HOSTILITIES AND TREACHERYo   43 ourselves, to appropriate to our own use. I want you, brother Brigham, to give us counsel that we can get the whole world in a string after us, and have it all in our own possession by and by." If there is light enough in Israel, let it shine in your consciences, and illuminate your understandings, and give you toknow that I tell you the truth. This is the object many have, in wishing to settle and take in land that is far distant from the main body of the people. I have not given you the language of their lips to me, but the language of their hearts. Elders of Israel -are greedy after the thingsof this world. If you ask them if they are ready to build up the kingdom of God, their answer is prompt-"Why, to be sure we are, with our whole souls; but we want first to get so much gold, speculate and get rich, and then we can help the Church considerably. We willgo to Cali- fornia and get gold, go and buy goods and get rich, trade with the emigrants, build a mill, make a farm, get a large herd of cattle, and then we can do a great deal for Israel." When will you be ready to do it?"In a few years, brother Brigham, if you do not disturb us. We do not believe in the necessity of doing military duty, in giving over our surplus property for tithing; we never could see into it; but we want to go and get rich, to ac- cumulate and amass wealth, by securing all the land ad- joining us, and all we 'tave knowledge of." If that is not the spirit of this people, then I do not know what the truth is concerning the matter. Now I wish to say to you who are fearing and trem- ling, do not be afraid at all, for it is certain if we should be killed off by the Indians, we could not die any younger; this is, about as good a time as can be for us to die, and if we all go together, why, you know, we  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8190-00000179"/> "        MORMONISM. shall have a good company along with us; it will nothe lonesome passing through th"e valley, which is said to have a vail drawn over it. If we all go together, the dark valley of the shadow of death will be lighted up byus, so do not be scared. But there will not be enough slain by the Indians at this time to make the company very conspicuous in that dark valley. Do you begin to secretly wish you had stayed in the States or in England alittle longer, until this Indian war had copme to an end a There is a mighty fearing and tremblingin the hearts of many. I know what men have done heretofore; when they have seen the enemy advancing, they have skulked they were sure to be somewhere else than on hand when there was fighting to do, although, upon the whole, I have no fault to find with the latter-day saints, or with the Elders of Israel upon that subject, for they love to fight a little too well. If I were to have fears concern- ing them, it would not be that they would make war, but in the case of war being made on them, I should have more fear in consequence of the ignorant and fool- ish audacity of the elders, -than of their being afraid. I should fear they would rush into danger like an un- thinking horse into battle. So I will not findfault with regard to their courage. On that point I am a coward myself, and if people would do as I tell them, I would not only save my own life, but theirs likewise. Suppose, now, that we should say to this congregation, and to all the wards of this city, thie time has coeefo U8 tofrt A! do you not think a great many persons would come immediately to me, and inquire if I did not think theirhouses quite safe enough, without being put to that trouble and expense , Yes, my office would be crowded with such persons, wanting to know if they   INDIAN HOSILITIES AND TREACHERY.   45 might not live where they were now living, " for," they would say, " we have got good houses, and well finished off, besides, such a course will ruin them, and our gardens will go to destruction; we really cannot fort up. "Would there not be a great amount of hard. feel- ings upon the subject? I think so, whether you do or not. f I think I should want as many as a legion of angels to :assist we to convince every family it was necessary, if it actually was so. I do not know but that the time may come, and that speedily, when I shall build a fort myself in this city, and those who are disposed can go into it with me, while the rest can stay out. When I see it is absolutely neces- sary to do this, I shall do it. If the people of Utah Territory would do as they were told, they would always be safe. If the people in^San Pete county had done as they were told,!from the beginning of that settlement, they would have been safe at this time, and would not have lost their cattle. The day before yesterday, Friday, July 29th, the Indians came from the mbuntains, to Father Allred's settlement, and drove off all the stock, amounting to two hundred head. If the people had done as they were told, they would not have suffered this severe loss, which is a just chastisement. I recollect when we were down at Father Allred's settlement last April, they had previously been to me not only to know if they might settle in San Pete, but if they might separate widely from each other, over a piece of land about two miles square, eachl having a five acre lot for their garden, near their farms. They were told to build a good subst antial fort, until the settlement became sufficiently strong, and not live so far apart, and expose themselves and their property to danger. Father  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8190-00000180"/> "        MORMONISM,. Allred told me they were then so nigh together, they did not know how to live! I told him they had better make up their minds to be baptized into the Church again, and get the Spirit of God, that each one might be able to-live in peace with his neighbor in close quar- ters; and not think himself infringed upon. They wanted to know if they were to build a fort. "Why, yes," I said, " build a strong fort, and a corral to put your cattle, that the Indians cannot get them away from you." "Do you think, brother Brigham, the Indians will trouble us here " they inquired. I said, "It is none of your business whether -they will or not, hut you will see the time that you will need such preparations."' But I did not think it would come so quickly. There -will more come upon this people to destroy them than they at present think of, unless they are prepared to de- fend themselves, which-I shall not take time, this morn- ing, to dwell upon. I said also to the brethren at Utah, "' Do you make a fort, and let it be strong enough, that Indians 'cannot break into it." They commenced, and did not make even the shadow of a fort, for in some places there was nothing more than a line to mark where the approaching shadow would be. They began to set- tle round upon the various creeks and streamlets, and the part of a fort that existed was finally pulled up, and carried away somewhere else. I have told you, from the beginning, you would need forts, where to build them, .and how strong. I told you six years ago, to build a fort that the .Devil could not get into, unless you were disposed to let him in, and that would keep out the Indians. Excuse me for saying devil; I do not often use the old gentleman's name in vain, and if I do it, it is always i the pulpit, where I do all my swearing. \j,   INDIAN HOSTILrIES AED TREBAOHBRY   41 I make this apology because it is considered a sin to say devil, and it grates on refined ears. I told the settlement in San Pete, at the first, to build a fort. They did not do it, but huddled together beside a stone quarry, without a place of common shelter where they could defend themselves,- in case of an Indian difficulty. They had faith they could keep the Indians off. Well, now is the time to call it into exercise. They did, after a while, build a temporary fort at San Pete, which now shields them in a time of trouble. When the brethren went to Salt Creek, they wanted to make a settlement there, and inquired of me if they might do so. I told'them, no, unless they first built an efficient fort. I forbade them taking their women and children there, until that preparatory work was fully accomplished. Has it ever been done? No, but families went there and lived in wagons and brush houses, per- fectly exposed to be killed. If they have faith enough to keep the Indians off, it is all right. From the time these distant valleys began to be set- tled, until now, there has scarceely been a day but what I have felt twenty-five ton weight, as it were, upon me, in exercising faith to keep this people fromn destroying themselves; but if, any of them can exercise faith enough for themselves, and wish to excuse me, I will take my faith back.' The word has gone out now, to the different settle- ments, in the time of harvest, requiring them to build forts. Could it not have been done last winter, bette'r than now . YYes. Do you not suppose people will now wish they had brilt forts when they were told? If they do not, it proves what they have been all the time, shall I say fools? If .that is too harsh a term, I will say they l  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8190-00000181"/> 48         MORMONISM. have been foolish. It is better for me to labor in build- ing a house or a fort, to get out fencing timber, and wood to consume through the winter, when I have nothing else to do, and not be under the necessity of leaving my grain on the ground to do those things. Harvest is no time to build forts, neither is it the time to do it when we should be plowing and sowing. Now the harvest is upon us, I wish to say a few words concerning it. I desire you to-tell your neighbors, and wish them to tell their neighbors, and thius let it go to the several counties around- now is the time for women and children to assist in the harvest fields, the same as they do in other countries. I never asked this of them before; I do not now ask it as a general thing, but those employed in the expedition south, in the work of defend- ing their brethern from Indian depredations, who have heavy harvests on hand, rather than suffer the grain to waste, let the women get in the harvest, and put it where the Indians cannot steal it. And when you go into the harvest field, carry a good butcher knife in your belt, that if an Indian should come upon you, -supposing you to be unarmed, you would be sure to kill him. Tell your neighbors of this, and go to work, men, women, and children, and gather in your grain, and gather it clean, leave none to waste, and put it where "the Indians cannot destroy it. Does this language intimate anything terrific to you? It need not. If you will do as you are told, you will be safe continually. Secure your bread stuff, your wheat, and your corn, when it is ripe, and let every particle of grain raised in these valleys be put where it will be safe, and as much as possible from vermin, and espe- cially from the Indians, and then build forts.   INDIAN HOSTILITIES AND TREAU&amp;V iKY.  49 Let every man and woman who has a house make that house a fort, from which you can kill ten where yon now only kill one, if the Indians come upon you. "Brother Brigham, do you really expect Indians to come upon us in this city)?"This inquiry, I have no doubt, is at this moment in, the hearts of a few, almost breathless with fear. Were I to answer such inquirers as I feel, I should say, it is none of your business; but I will say, you are so instructed, to see if you will do as you are told. Let your dwelling house be a perfect fort. From the day I lived where brother Joseph Smith lived, I have been fortified all the time so as to resist twenty men, if they should come to my house in the night, with an intent to molest my family, assault my person, or destroy my property; and I have always been in the habit of sleeping with one eye open, and if I cannot then sufficiently watch, I will get my wife to help me. Let an hostile band of Indians come round my house, and I am good for quite a number of them. If one hundred should come, I calculate that only fifty would be able to go to the next house, and if the Saints there used up the other fifty, the third house would be safe. But instead of the people taking this course, almost every good rifle in the Territory hs been traded away to the Indians, with quantities of powder and lead, though they waste it in various ways when they have got it. The whites would sell the title to their lives, for the sake of trading with the Indians. They will learn better, I expect, by and by, for the people have never received such strict orders as they have got now. I will give you the pith of the last orders issued--"That man or family who will not do as  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8190-00000182"/> - SO        MORMONISM. they are told in the orders, are to be treated as stran- gers, yea, even as enemies, and not as friends." And if there should be such a contest, if we should be called upon to :defend ollr lives, our liberty, and our posses- sions, we would cut such off the first, and walk over their dead bodies to conquer the foe outside. Martial law is not enforced yet, although the whole Territory is in a state of war, apparently, but it is only the Utah [Indians] who have declared war on Utah [Territory]. Deseret has not yet declared war; how soon it will be declared is not for me to say; but we have a right, and it is our duty, to put ourselves in a state of self-defence. The few families that settled in Cedar Valley, at the point of the mountains, were instructed to leave there, lastS spring. They have gone back again, upon their own responsibility, and now want to know what they must do. They have been told to do just as -they have a mind to. Those who have taken their wives and children in the canons to live, have been, told to remove them into the city; and if you want to make shingles, or do any other work that requires you to remain there, have your gun in a situation that an Indian cannot creep up and steal it from you before you are aware, that you can be good for a few Indians if they should chance to come upon you. If I wished to live away from the- body of the people, my first effort should be direct{ed'towards building a good and efficient fort. When new  settlements were made in the eastern countries, they built them of tim- ber, and they were called " block-houses." I would advise that every house in -a new settlement should be   INDIAN HOSTILITIES AND TREACHERY.   51 made good for all the Indians that could approach it, with an intention to tear it down. If I did not do that, I would go to where I could be safe, I would take up my abode with the body of the people. I wonld take my family- there at least. By taking this course, every per- son will be safe from the depredations of the Indians, which are generally committed upon the defenceless, and unprotected portions of the community. I know what the feelings of the generality of the people are, at this time--they think all the Indians in the mountains are coming to kill off the latter-day saints. I have no more fear of that, than I have of the sun ceasing to give light upon the earth. I have studied, the Indian character sufficiently to know what the Indianls are in war, I have been with them more or less fromn my youth upward, where they have often had wars among themselves. , Let every man, woman, and child, that can handle a butcher knife, be good for one Indian, and you are safe. I am aware that the people want to ask me a thous- and and one questions, whether they have done it or not, touching the present Indian difficulties. I have tried to answer them all, in my own mind, by saying, it will be just as'the-Lord will. How many times have I been asked in the past week, what I intend to do with Walker. I say, LET HM ALONE, severely. I have not made war on the Indians, nor am I calculating to do it. . My policy is to give them presents,: and be kind to them. Instead of being Walker's ernkmy, I have sent him a great pile of tobacco to smoke when he is lonely in the mountains. He is now at war with the only friends he has upon this earth, and I want him to have some tobacco to smoke.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8190-00000183"/> 62         MORMONISM. I calculate to pursue just such a course. with the Indians, and when I am dictated to by existing circum- stances, and the Spirit of the Lord, to change my course, I will do it, and not until then. If you were to see Walker, do you think you would' kill him? You that want to kill him, I will give you a mission to that effect. A great many appear very bold, and desire to go and bring me Walker's head, but they want all the people in Utah to go with them.' 1 could point out thousands in this Territory who would follow these Indians, and continue to follow them, and leave the cattle fto be driven off by the emigrants, and the grain to perish, and thus subject the whole community to the ravages of famine, and its consequent evils. I have been teased and teased by men who will come to me and say, "Just give me twenty-five, fifty, or a hun- dred men, and I will go and fetch you Walker's head." I do not want his head, but I wish him to do all the devil wants him to do,.so far as the Lord will suffer him, and the devil to chastise this people for their good. I say to the Indians, as I have often said to the mob, go your length. You say you are going to kill us all off, you say you are going to obliterate the latter-day saints, and Wipe them from the earth, why don't you do it, you poor miserable curses - The mob only had power to drive the Saints to their duty, and to remember the Lord their God, and that is all the Indians can do. This people are worldly-minded, they want to get rich in earthly substance, and are apt to forget their God, the pit from which they were dug, and the rockrfrom which they were hewn, every man turning to his own way. Seemingly the Lord is chastening us until we turn and do 'His will. What are you willing to do I Would you be 88A    INDIAN HOSTILITIES AND TREACHERY.  53 . willing to build a fort, and all go in there to live? I tell you, you would have a hell of' your own, and devils enough to carry it on. Do you suppose you will ever see the time you would do that, and live at peace with each other, and have the spirit of the Lord enough to look each other in the face, and say, with a heart full of kindness-, "Good morning, Mary," or "How do you do, Maria?"You will be whipped until you have the Spirit of the Lord Jesus-Christ sufficiently to love your breth- ren and sisters freely, men, women, and children; until  you can live at peace with yourselves, and with every family around you; until you can treat every child as though it were the tender offspring of your own body, every man as your brother, and every woman as your 'sister; and until the young persons treat the old with that respect due to parents, and all learn to shake hands, with a warm heart, and a friendly grip, and say, "God bless you!" from morning until evening; until each per- son can say, "I love you all, I have no evil in my heart to any individual, I can send my children to school with yours, and can correct your children when they do wrong, as though they were my own, and I am willing you should correct mine, and let us live together until we are a holy and-sanctified society." There will always be Indians or somebody else to chastise you, until you come to that spot; so amen to the present Indian trouble, for it is all right. I am just as willing the rebellious of this people should be kicked, and cuffed, and mobbed, and hunted by the Indians, as not, for I have preached to them until I am tired. I will give no more counsel to any person upon the-duties of self-preservation; you . can do as you please; if you will not preserve yourselves, T may reason with you until my tongue cleaves to the  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8190-00000184"/> 54      -  MORMONISM. roof of my mouth, to no avail. Let the ,Lord extend the hand of benevolence to brother Walker, and he will make you do it by other means than' exhortations given in mildness. - This very same Indian Walker has a mission upon. him, and I do not blame him for what he is now doing; he is helping me do the will of the Lord to this people, he is doing with a chastening rod what I have failed to accomplish with soft words, while I have been handing * out my substance, feeding the hungry, comforting the- sick. , But this has no effect upon this people, at all, my counsel has not been heeded, so the Lold is making brother Walker an instrument to help me, and perhaps the means that he will use will have their due effect. Do you suppose I want to kill him? No. I should be killing the very means that will make this people do what we wanted them to do years ago. There are hundreds of witnesses to bear testimony that I have counselled this people, from the beginning, what to do to save themselves, both temporally and spiritually.          , In one of our orders issued lately, the southern settle- ments were advised to send their surplus cattle to this valley. No quicker had the news reached them, than our ears were greeted with one continued whine, which meant, "We are afraid you want them." So we did, to take care of them for you. When Father Allred was advised to adopt measures to secure themselves and their property, he replied, "Oh, I do hot think there is the least danger in the world; we are perfectly able to take care of our stock, and pro- tect ourselves against the Indians." All right, I thought, let cirncumstf n.es. nravae t hnt.   INDIAN HOSTILITIES AND TRBACHEBY.   65 Now, as difficulties surround them, they say to me, "Why, brother Brigham, if you had only told us what to do, we would have done it. Were we not always willing to take your counsel?"Yes, you are a great Ldeal more willing to take it, than to obey it. If people are willing to carry out good counsel, they will secure themselves accordingly., I have thought of setting a pattern, by securing my- self; but were I to build a fort for myself and family, I should want, about a legion of angels from the throne of God, to stay nine months with me, to get my folks wil- ling to go into it. But I am so independent about it, I care not the-snap of my finger for one of them. If my wives will not go into a place of security with me, it is all right, they can stay out, and I will go in and take my children with me. I say, I do not know but I may take a- notion to set a pattern by building a fort; if I do, some one in in this city may follow my example, and then somebody else, etc., until we have a perfect city of forts "Brother Brigham, do you really think we shall ever need them 8 YES, I DO. .All the difficulties there is in the community this year, is not a drop in comparison to the heavy shower that will come. "Well, and where is it coming from?"From hell, where every other trouble comes from. "And who do you think will be the actors?' Why, the Devil and his imps. [W. W Phelps in the stand. We could not do very well without a Devil.] No, sir, you are quite aware of that; you know we could riot do without him. If there had been' no devil to tempt Eve, she never would have got her eyes opened. We need a devil to stir up the wicked on the  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8190-00000185"/> earth toMuORMONIM    . earth to purify the saints. Therefore, let the devilf howl, let them rage, and thus exhibit themselves in the form of those poor; foolish Lamanites., Let theen go o in their work, and do you not desire to ill them, until they ought to be killed, and then we 'will extinguisl the Indian title, if it is required. Did you never feel to pity them, on viewing their wretched condition?

I will relate one action of Walker's life, which will serve to illustrate his character. He, with his band about last February, fell il with a small band of Payedes, and killed off thewhole of the men, took the squaws pris- oners, and sold the children to the Mexicans, and some few were disposed of in this Territory. This transaction was told by Arapeen, Walker's brother, though he vas not at the affray himself. The Indians in these mountains are continually on the decrease; bands that numbered 150 warriors when we first came here,'number not more than 35 now; and some of the little thibes in the southern parts of this Territory, towards New Mexico, have not a single squaw amongst them, for they have traded them off for horses, etc. This practice will soon make the race extinct. Besides, Walker is continually, whenever an opportu.   INDIAN HOSTILITIES AND TREAOHERY.   57 nity presents itself, killing and stealing children from the wandering bands that he has any power over, which also has its tendency to extinguish the race. Walker is hemmed in, he dare not go into California again. Dare he go east to the Snakes . No. Dare he go north? No, for they would rejoice to kill him. Here he is, penned up in a small compass, surrounded by ltis enemies; and now the elders of Israel long to eat up, as it were, him and his little band. What are they? They are a set of cursed fools. Do you not rather pity them? They dare not move over a certain boundary, on any of the four points of the compass, for fear of being killed; then they are killing one another, and making war upon this people that could use them up, and they not be a breakfast spell for them if they felt so disposed. See their condition, and I ask you, do you not pity them? From all appearance, there will not be an Indian left, in a short time, to steal a horse. Are they not fools, under these circumstances, to make war with their best friends?2 Do you want to run after them to kill them? I say, let them alone, for peradventure God may pour out His Spirit upon them, and show them the error of their ways. We may yet have to fight them, though they are of the house of Israel to whom the message of salvation is sent; for their wickedness is so great, that the Lord Al- mighty cannot get at the hearts of the older ones to teach them saving principles. Joseph Smith said we should have to figh t them. He said, "When this people mingle among the Lamanites, if they do not bow down in obedience to the Gospel, they will hunt them until there is but a small remnant of them left upon this con- tinent." They have either got to bow down to the Gos-  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8190-00000186"/> 58         3mOERMONISM i pel or be slain. Shall we slay them simply because they will not obey the Gospel? - No. But they will come to us and try to kill us, and, we shall be under the necessity of killing them to save our own lives. I wished to lay these things before the people this morning, to answer a great many-questions, and allay their fears. Yesterday, brother Kimball heard at his mill, ten miles north, that I had sent word to him, that the mountains were full of Indians, and he and the  families with him were to move into the city; so they inmmediately obeyed this report. Brother Kimball calne to me and inquired if I had sent such orders. I said no. But it is all right, for I wanted the women and children from  there. This shows the excited state of the people.  One thing more. I   ask you men who have been with Joseph in the wars he passed through, and who were with him at the time of his death, what was it that preserved us, to all outward appearances?  It is true in reality, God did it. But by what means did Hie keep the mob from destroying us?  It was by means of beiny  well armed with the weapons of death to sened them to . hell cross lots. Just so you have got to do., And for this people fostering to themselves that the day has come  for them to sell their guns and ammlni- tion to their enemies, and sit down to jsleep in peace, they will find themselves deceived, and before they know, they will sleep until they are slain. They have got to carry weapons with them, to be ready to send their enemies to hell cross lots, whether they be Lamanites, or mobs who may come   to take their lives, or destroy their property. We must be so prepared that they dare not come to us in a hostile manner without being assured    *               -  X   INDIAN HOSTILITIES AND TREAOHLbcY.   59 they will meet a vigorous resistance, and ten to one they will meet their grave. The Lord will suffer no more trouble to come upon us than is necessary to bring this people to their senses. You need not go to sleep under the impression that it is the north and south only that is in danger, and we are all safe here. Now mind, let this people here lie down to sleep, and be entirely off their watch, and the first thing they know, they are in the greatest danger. You must not desert the watch tower,- but do as I do-keep some, person awake in your house all night long, and be ready, at the least tap of the foot, to offer a stout resis- tance, if it is required. Be ready at any moment to kill twenty of your enemies at least. Let every house be a fort. After the cattle were stolen at San Pete, a messenger arrived here in about thirty hours to report the affair, and obtain advice. I told brother Wells, "you can write to them, and say, ' Inasmuch as you have no cows and oxen to trouble you, you can go to harvesting, and take care of yourselves. '" If you do not take care of yourselves, brethren, you will not be taken care of. I take care of them that help themselves. I will help you that try to help yourselves, and carry out the maxim of Doctor Dick--"God helps them that help them- selves.. ' I am my own policeman, and have slept, scores of nights, with my gun and sword by my side, that is, if I slept at all. I am still a policeman. Now is the day to watch. - It is as important for me to watch now, as well as pray, as it ever has been since I came into this king- dom.

If you are found there helping your, sons, your husbands and your brethren, to gather in the harvest, I say, God bless yon, and I will also.

I FEEL disposed to say a few words on the present occasion. It is said, that " at the sight of the eyes the heart is made to rejoice*" This is truly the case with me this afternoon, when I look upon the congregation to see this spacious hall filled with the Saints of the Most High, for the purpose of partaking of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. It is a sight which I have not had tile privilege of seeing before, only onr Conference days. This morning I looked round to see how the house was crowded, which was packed to that extent, that scores could not be seated. I looked if peradventure I could designate any person that did not belong to the Church, that did not profess to be a Saint; bui I could not see a single person of- that description, that I knew of. I thought, why not be as diligent to attend the afternoon meetings, to partake of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, as to attend the morning meetings I Hitherto it has not been the case, but my heart rejoices to'see the house so well filled this afternoon. I feel in my heart to bless you I it is full of blessings and not cursings. It is something that does not occupy my feelings to curse any individual, but I will modify this by saying those  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8190-00000188"/> 2      OMOBONIOSM. *     *  who ought not to be cursed. Who ought to be? Those who know their master's will, and do it not; they are worthy o many stripes; it is not those who do not know, and do not do, but those who know it, and do not do it-- they are the ones to be chastised. While the brethren have been speaking upon the} blessings the Lord bestows upon this people, my mind has reflected upon many of the cir cunstances of life, and upon certain principles. I will ask you a uestion- Do you think Persons can be blessed  too muei Iwill answer it myrself. Tea, they can, they can be blessed to their injury. For instance, suppose a person should be blessed with the knowledge of the holy Gospel, whose heart is set in him to do evil. We esteem this as a blessing, and would not the Lord consider it a blessing to bestow His favors and, mercies upon any individual, by giving him a knowledge of life and salvation  ] But suppose He bestowed it upon persons whose hearts were set in them to do evi, who would by their wickedness turn these blessings into curses, they would be blessed too much. It is possible to bless people to death, you can bless them to everlasting misery by heaping too many blessings upon them. Perhaps this is what is meant by the saying--It is like heaping coals of fire upon their heads; it will injure thern, consume them burn them, destroy them. Suffice it to say, that people can be blessed too much. Can you bless a wise man too much? a man who knows what to do with his blessings when they are bestowed upon him? No, Vou cannot. Can you bless a wise people too much ? No, it is im possible, when they know how  to im prove upon all blessings that are bestowed upon them. But the Lord does and will bless the inhabitants-of th e earth with   such great and inestimable blessings, in the proclamation of the Gospel, that they will be damned wlio reject them, for light brings condemnation ito men who love darkness rather than light. Have this people been blessed too much? I will not positively say, but I think they have, inasmuch as their blessings in some instances have been to their injury. Why? Because they have not known what to do with their blessings. While the brethren were speaking of the liberal hand of Providence in bestowing abundantly the products of' the earth, it occurred to me, that this people, to my certain knowledge, had felt that they had too much, and they esteemed it at good for nothing. It is true what brother: Jedediah Btrant said with regard to wheat, and other grains, for I have seen it myself. I have seen hundreds, and thousands, and scores of thousands of bushels of grain lying to waste and rot, when it has not brought a great prices MVIany of this people leave thought, and expressed themselves in language like-this -"I can go to California, and get so much gold, or I can trade and make so much gold, I cannot therefore spend time to take care of wheat, nor to raise it; let it lie there and rot while I go and accumulate riches," They were then wealthy, for. their granaries and barns were full of the blessings of the Lord, but now they are empty, because they did not know what to do with their blessings, I can tell this people how to dispose of all their bless- ings, if they will only allow me time enough; and if I cannot tell them how, I can show them. For instance, you who have fields of wheat, beyond the limits of grass- hoppers,. will have considerable crops when it is harvest-  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8190-00000189"/> MORMONTSM I ed and perhaps so much that you- will not know what to withit. I know what you Ought to do  with it;you ought to say to yonr poor brethren--, Come and help take care of my grain, and share with me, and feed yourselves and your families." If you have so much that you cannot take care of it, and your neighbor is not without bread, tell Bishop Hunter that you have got so many hundred bushels to lay over in the store, and you will have the benefit of it on your tithin That is what I recommend you to do with your blessings, when you have more than you can take care of yourselves. t say, hand it over and let your neighbors take care of it for you. This makes me think of what I saw the first year I came into this valley, the same year I moved my family, which was the next season after the pioneers arrived here. It was late in the season when I arrived, but from the ground where this house now stands, there had been two crops of wheat. They had harvested the first crop very early, and the water being flooded over, it again started from the roots, and produced a fair crop, say from ten to twelve bushels to the acre. That was bar. vested, and it was coming up again. I said to the brethren, Let these my brethren who have come witi me gather up this-wheat, " but they would not sufftr then to do it. Some of the brethren had gathered their crops of grain, and left a great deal wasting on the fields, I  said, ' Let the poor brethren, who have come in from abroad, glean in your fields." You can bear me wit- ness that a great many widows and poor men came here and brought but very little with them, and there never was a man, to my knowledge, ever explressed a desire to let them glean in his field. "All right, "I said, ' we   USE AND ABuSE OF BTLESSNGS.    65 can live on greefls," while. at the same time there was more wasted that season than to make up the deficiency, that all might have been comfortable. Late in the fall I saw one man working among his corn; he had a large crop, more than a single man could take care of. I saw he was going to let it go to waste ; I said to him, "Bro- ther, let the brethren and sisters help you to husk your corn, to gather it and put it safely away, for so much it will benefit them jand help. you. O, " he replied, A I have nothing to spare,- I can take care "of it myself" I saw it wasting, and said to him, "Brother, get your corn husked immediately, and let the brethren do it, sand pay them with a portion of it." He replied, "I cannot spare a bit of it." I have no question of it at all in my mind, but three-fourths of his corn went into the mud, and was trampled down by the cattle; and women and children went without bread in consequence of it. That man had no judgment, he knew not what to do with his blessings the Lord had bestowed upon him. Were I to ask the question, how much wheat or any- thing else a man must have to justify him in letting it go to waste, it would be hard to answer; figures are inadequate to give the amount. NSever let anything go to waste. Be prudent, save everything, and what you get more than you can take care of yourselves, ask your neighbors to help you. There are scores and hundreds of men in this house, if the question were asked them if they considered their grain a burthen and a drudge to them, when they had plenty last year and the year before, that would answer in the affirmative, and were ready to part with it for next to nothing. How do they feel now, when their granaries are empty If they had ,9* ' I    &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8190-00000190"/> "        hMORMONISM. a few thousand bushels to spare now, would they not consider it a blessing? They would. Why? Because it would bring the gold and silver. But pause for a mo- ment, and suppose you had millions of bushels to sell and could sell it for twenty dollars per bushel, or for a million of dollars per bushel, no matter what amount so that you sell all your wheat, and transport it out of the country, and you are lIft with nothing more than a  pile of gold, what good would it do you You, Could not eat it, drinkh it, wear it, or carry it off where you could have sonething to eat. The time will come that gold will hold no comparison in value to a bushel of wheat. Gold is not to be compared with it in value. Why would it be precious to you now? Simply because you could get gold -for it? . Gold is good for nothing, only as men value it. It is no better than a piece of iron, apiece of limestone, or a piece of sandstone, and it is not half so good as the soil from which we rise our wheat, and other necessaries of life. The children of men love it, they lust after it, are greedy for it, and are ready' to destroy themselves and those around them, over whom they have any influence, to gain it. When this people are blessed so much that they con- sider their blessings a burden and a drudge to them, you may always calculate on a cricket war, a grasshopper war, a drought, too much rain, or something else to make the scales preponderate the otherway. Thispeo- pie have been blessed too muchi, so that they have not known what to do with their blessings. Wlhat do we hear fromn the inhabitants of the different settlements? The cry is--"I do not wish ,to live out xoMder, for there is no chance to speculate and trade i'ith the emigrants." Have you plenty to eat? Hlave   USE AND ABUSE OF BLESSINGS.    67 you plenty of wheat, fowls, butter, cheese, and calves? Are you not raising stock in abundance for flesh meat of different kinds? What use is gold if you get enough to eat, drink, and wear without it? What is the iatter? "Why, we are away off, and cannot get rich all at once.' You are lusting after that which you do not know what to do with, for few men know what to do with riches when they possess them. The inhabitants of this valley have proved it. They have proved it. by their reckless waste of the products of the earth, by their undervaluing the blessings conferred upon them by the emigration, which has-administered clothing and other necessaries to them., We can see men who\can clothe themselves and their families easily, go int6thie canons in their broad cloth- pantaloons to get wood, or you may see them take a horse, and ride bare-backed until they tare them to pieces, that they are not fit to come to- meeting in.  They do not know how to take care of good clothing. Again, if we were digging in a water-ditch to-morrow, that required all hands, in con- sequence of the rising cf the water, I have no doubt but you would see what I saw the other day-one of our young dandies, who was perhaps not worth the shirt on his back, came to work in a water-ditch, dressed in his fine broad-cloth pantaloons, and a fine bosomed shirt, and I have no doubt he would have worn gloves too if he had been worth a pair. You would 'see men of this description, who are without understanding, -whole hearted, good fellows, and ready to do anything for the advancemerit of the public good, commence to dig in the mud and wet, in their fine clothes, and go into the water, up to their knees, with their fine calf-skin boots. This is a wanton waste of the blessings of God, that can- &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8190-00000191"/> 68         MO RO2M\sr.  \ not be justifiable in His eyes, and in the eyes of prudent thinking men, under ordinary circumstances. If pru- dence and economy are necessary at one time more than another, it is when a family or a nation are thrown upon its own resourses, as we are. But you may trace the whole lives of some men, and it will be impossible for you to point out a single portion of time, when they knew how to appreciate and how to use even the corn-  mon comforts of life, when they had them, to say nothing of an abundance of wealth. Again, there have been more contention and trouble between neighbors, in these valleys, with regard to sur- : plus -property, which was not needed by this people, than any other thing. For instance, a widow woman' comes in here from the United Statesj and turas out on t erange beyond Jordan, three yoke of oxen and a few cown^ or she considers she is too poor to have them herded. Again, a man comes in with ten yoke of oxen; he also turns them out to wander where they please. If he is asked why he does not put them in a herd, he will tell you I do not want to pay the herding fee." Another comes on with three or four span of horses, and twenty or thirty yoke of cattle. Has he any for sale . No, but he turns them all out upon the range and they are gone. By and by he sends a boy on horseback to hunt them, whoJs unsuccessful in finding them after a week's toil. The owner turns out himself, and all hands, to hunt up his stock, but they also fail in finding them, they are all lost except a very few. He was not able to have them herded, he thought, though he pos- sessed so much property, and knew nothing more than to turn them out to rub at large. Thus he consumes his time, running after his lostproperty. He frets his feel- t rpry     j8f-t i el   USE AND ABUSE OF BLESSINGS.    69 ings, for his mind is continually upon it; he is in such a hurry in the morning to go out to hunt his stock, that he has no time to pray; when lie returns home late at night, worn out with toil and anxiety of mind, he is unfit to pray; his cattle are lost, his mind is unhinged and darkened through -the neglect of his duty, and apostacy stares him in the face, for he is not satisfied with himself, and murmurs against his brethren, and against his God. By and by some of his cattle tarn up with a strange brand upon them; they have been taken up, and sold to this person or that one. This brings con- tention and dissatisfaction between neighbor and neigh- bor. Such a person has too much property, more than he knows what to do with. It would be much better for a man who is a mechanic, and intends to follow his business, to give one out of two cattle which he may possess, to some person, for taking care of the other. It would be better for those who. possess a great quantity of stock, to sell half of them to fence in a piece of land, to secure the other half, than to drive them all out to run at large, and lose three-fourths of them. If there are half-a-dozen men round me, and I can put a cow in their way or anything else that will do them any good, for fencing up a lot for me, the property I thus pay is not out of the world, but is turned over to those jnen who had not a mouthful of -meat, butter, or milk; it is doing them good, and I am reaping the profit and bene- fit of their labors in exchange. If I did not do this, I must either see them suffer, or'make a free distribution of a part 6f what I have among them. It is impossible for me to tell you how much a man must possess to entitle him to the liberty of wasting any- thing, or of letting it be stolen and run away with by  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8190-00000192"/> I                         I MORMONISM.  the Indians. The surplus property of this community, as poor as we are, has done more real -mischief than everything else besides". I will propose a plan to stop the stealing of cattle in coming time, and it is this-let those who have catt le  on hand join in a company, and fence in about fifty thousand acres of land, make a dividend of their cattle,  and appropiate what they can spare, to fence in a large eld, and this will give employment to immigrants who are coming in When you have done this, then get up  another company, and so keep on fencing until all the, vacant land is substantially enclosed.  a Some persons will perhaps say-"I do not know how good and how high a fence it will be necessary to build to keeD thieves out. I do not know either, except you build one that will keep out the devil. Build a fence  which the boyss and the cattle cannot pull down, and I  will ensure you will keep your stock. Let every man lay his plans so as to secure for his present necessities and hand over the rest to the laboring man; keep make i ing improvements, building, and making farms, and that will not only advance his own wealth, but the wealth of the community. A man has no right with property, which, according ;o the laws of the land, legally belongs to him, if he loes not want to use it; he ought to possess no more han he can put to usury, and cause to do good to him  elf and his fellow-man.

Every man who has got cattle, money, or wealth of any description, bone and sinew, should put it out to usury. If a man has the arm, body, head, the component parts of a system to constitute him a laboring man, and has nothing in the world to depend upon but his hands, let him put them to usury. Never hide up anything in a napkin, but put it forth to bring an increase. If you have got property of any kind, that you do not know what to, do with, lay it out in making a farm, or .building a saw mill or a woollen fac- tory, -and go to with your mights to put all your pro- perty to usury. If you have more oxen and other cattle than you need, put them in the hands of other men, and receive their labor in return, and put that labor where it will increase your property in value. I hope you will now lay your plans to set men to work who will be in here by and by, for there will be a host of them, and they will all want employment, who trust to their labor for a subsistence; they will all want something to eat, and calculate to work for it. In the first place keep the ground in good order to produce you plentiful crops of grain, and vegetables, and then take care of them. Let me say to the sisters, those who lave children, never consider that you have bread enough around you to suffer your children to waste a crust or a crumb of it.

No, I would rather feed the greatest enemy I have on the earth with it, than have it go into the fire. Remember it, do not waste anything, but take care of every- thing; save your grain, and make your calculations, so that when the brethren come in from the United States, from England, and other places, you can give them some potatoes, onions, beets, carrots, parsnips, water- melons, or anything else which you have, to comfort them, and cheer up their hearts, and if you- have wheat, dispose of it to them, and receive their labor in return. Raise enough and to spare of all the staple necessaries of life, and lay your plans to hire your brethren who will come in this fall to fence your farms, improve your gardens, and make your city lots beautiful. Lay your plans to secure enough to feed yourselves, and one or two of the brethren that are coming to dwell with us. When we first came into the valley, the question was asked me, if men would ever be allowed to colne into this Church, and remain in it and hoard up their pro- perty. I say, No. That is a short answer, and it is a pointed one.  The man who lays up his gold and silver who caches it a-way in a bank, or in his iron safe, or buries it up in the earth, and comes here, and professes to be aSaint, would tie up the hands of every individu- al in this kingdom, and make them his servants if he   X 1&amp; X3  17a r   73   USE AND ABUSE OF BLESSINGS.   could. It is an unrighteous, unhallowed, unholy, cove t- ous principle; it is of the devil, and is from beneath. Let every person who has capital, put it to usury. Is he required to bring his purse to mlp to any of the twelve, or to any person whatever, a lay it at their feet? N o, not by me. But I will tell you what to do with your means. If a man comes in the midst of this people with money, let him use it in making improve- ments, in building, in beautifying his inheritance in Zion, and in increasing his capital by thllus putting out his money to usury. Let him go and make a great farm, and stock it well, and fortify it all around with a good and efficient fence. What for? Why for the purpose of spending his .money. Then let him cut it up into fields, and adorn it with trees, and build a fine house upon it. , What for? Why for the purpose of spending his money. What will he do when his money is gone? The money thus spent with a wise and prudent hand, is in a situation to accumulate and increase a hundred fold. When he has done making his farm, and his means still increase by his diligent use of it, he can then commence and build a woollen factory, for instance, he can send and buy the sheep and have them brought here, have them herded here, and shear them here, and take care of them, then set the boys and girls to cleaning, carding, spinning, and weaving the wool into cloth, and thus employ hun. dreds and thousands of the brethren and sisters who have come from the manufacturing districts of the old coun- try, and, have not been accustomed to dig in the earth for their livelihood, who have not learned anything else but to work in the factory. This would feed them, and clothe them, and put within their reach the comforts of life; it would also create at home a steady market for   &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8190-00000194"/> 74         h MORMONISM. the produce of the agriculturist, and the labor of the mechanic. When he has spent his hundred and fifty thousand dollars, Mhch he began business with, and fed five hundred persons, from five to ten years, besides realizing a handsome profit from the labor of the hands employed, by the increased population, and consequent increased demand for manufactured goods, at the end of ten years his factory would be worth five hundred thousand dollars. Suppose he had wrapped up his hun- dred and fifty thousand in a napkin, for fear of losing it, it would have sent him down to perdition, for the princi- ple is from beneath. But when he puts forth his money to usury, not to me or any other person, but where it will redouble itself, by making farms, building factories for the manufacture of every kind of Material necessary for home consumption, establishing blacksmiths' shops and other mechanical establishments, making extensive improvements to beautify the whole face of the earth, until it shall become like the garden of Eden, it be- comes a saving blessing to him. and those around him. And when the kings, princes, and rulers of the earth shall come to Zion, bringing their gold, and silver, And precious stones with them, they will admire and desire your possessions, your fine farms, beautiful vineyards, and splendid mansions. They will say-- We have got plenty of money, but we are destitute of such posses- sions -as these." Their money loses its value in their eyes when compared with the comfortable possessions of the Saints, and they will want to purchase your pro- perty. The industrious capitalist inquires of one of them-"Do you want to purchase this property?  I have obtained it by my economy and judgment, and by the labor of, my brethren, and in exchange for their   USE AND ABUSE OF BLESSINGS.    75 labor I have been feeding and clothing them, until they also have comfortable si'tations, and means to live. I liave this farm, which I am willing to sell to enable me to advance my other improvements."' Well," says the rich man, 4 how much must I give you for it?" "Five hundred thousand dollars," and perhaps it has not cost him more than one hundred thousand. He takes the money and builds up three or four such farms, and em- ploys huntlreds of his brethren who arle poor. Money is not real capital, it bears the title only. True capital is labor, and is confined to the laboring classes. They only possess it. It is the 'tone, sinew, nerve, and muscle of man that subdue the earth, make it yield its strength and admillister to his varied wants. This power-tears down inountains and fills up valleys, builds cities and temples, and paves the streets. In short, what is there that yields shelter and comfort to civilized man, that is not produced by the strength of his arm the making elements bend to his will  I will not ask the question again--Row much must a man possess to authorize him to waste anything! Three or four years ago money was of little value in this country; you might go round exhibiting a back load of gold, andlhold out a large piece to a man, I was going to say, almost as big as this Bible, and ask him to work for you, but he would laugh at your offer, and tell you he was looking for some one to work for him. He would then hail another man who had been in Nauvoo, and passed through the pinches there, and had scarcely a shirt to his back, but he would reply--"I was looking for some man to work for me." Gold could not pur- chase labor, it was no temptation whatever, but those times are passed. It is not now as it was then. I con-  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8190-00000195"/> 76       - ;\OZMOMONISM.  sequently alter my counsel to the brethren. I used to command you to hand over your surplus property, or that which you could not take care of, to me, and I would apply it to a good purpose, but now I counsel you to put it into the hands of men who have nothing at all, and let them pay you for it in labor. I have never been troubled with thieves stealing my property. If I am not smart enough to take care of what the Lord lends me, I am smart enough to hold my tongue about it, until I come across the thief myself, and then I am ready to tie a string round his neck. I have not the least hesitation in saying that the loose conduct, and calculations, and manner of doing busi- ness, which have characterized men who have had pro- perty in their hands, have laid the foundation to bring our boys into the spirit of stealing. You have caused them to do it, you have laid before them every induce- ment possible, to learn their hands, and train their minds to take that which is not their own. Those young men who have been taken up the past season and condemned to ignominious punishment, may trace the cause of their shame to that foundation.  Distribute your property. The man that thinks he requires ten yoke of cattle, and can only use one yoke, is laboring under a mistake, he ought, to let nine yoke go to the laboring community. If every man would do this with the property which he is noq using, all would be employed and have sufficient. Ths would be the most effectual means of bringing the vile practice of stealing cattle and other property to a termination, which, as I have already said, has been en- couraged by covetous, selfish men, who have refused to use their properIty for their own good, or the commiunit t7 ff*,   Let us hold before our mind the miser. If the people of this community feel as though they wanted the whole world to themselves, hate any other person to possess anything, -and would hoard up their property, and placse it in a situation where it would not benefit either them- selves or the community, they are just as guilty as the hian who steals my property. You may inquire-- "What should be done with such a character?"Why, CUT HM OFF FROM THE CHURCH.  I ouldo disfellowship a man who had received liberally fromn the Zord, and re- fused to put it out to usury. We know this is right. I recollect well the days brother Grant was telling of, when it was so hard to raise fifty dollars for brother Jo- seph. I also remember we had a man for trial before the high council, a man who had plenty of money, and re- fused to loan it, or use it for the advancement of the cause of truth. He would not put his money out to usury. I was going into the council when he was making his plea, and he wept and sobbed. His name was Isaac McWithy, a man about fifty-three years of age. I knew him whe'n he lived on his farm in York State. He told them, in his plea, what he had done for the cause, that he had always been a Christian, and had done so much for the churches,-and for the priests, and been so liberal since he had been in this church, which was between three and four years. Some of the brethren said- "Brother McWithy, how much do you suppose you have ever given for the support of the Gospel?"The tears rolled down his cheeks, and he said, "Brethren, I believe I hbve given away in my lifetime two hundred and fifty dollars." I spake out and said, "If I could not preach as many months-'each year in this kingdom as you -have been years in this Church, and give no -more  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8190-00000196"/> 78        -M QORMONISM s than two hundred and fifty dollars, I should be ashamed of myself."    On one occasion, brother Joseph Young and myself had travelled more than two hours among snow, and in a piercing cold, to preach in his neighborhood o ne even  ing. Having had no dinner or supper, we went home  with him, and he never asked us to eat a mouthful of , supper, though he, did muster courage enough to go into the cellar with a little basket, he came up with the tears almost running down his cheeks, and said with some X difficulty---, Brethren, have some apples." i He held out the basket to us, and when we were about to help our- selves, his niggardly soul made him draw it back again, for fear we should take any. I saw he did not intend  us to have any apples, so I put my hand on the basket, and drew it out of his hand, saying-"Come here." I  took it on my knees, and invited brother Joseph to eat I some apples.  He did make out to give us some break-  fast ini the morning, and even then he got up from the  table before we had time to half finish our breakfast, to see if we would not give over-eating.- Said H-"Never mind, I shall eat what I want before I stop."' I am happy to say, through your trustee in trust, that the latter-day saints, in the capacity of a church and kingdom, d9 not owe near as much money as they have on hand. A iyear ago last April conference, we owed, over sixty thousand dollars, but we do not now owe a single red cent. May God bless us, that we may always have'enough, and know what to do with what we have, and how to use it for the good of all, for I would not give much for property unless I did know what to do with it.   "MORMONISM.        7 , MORMONISM." DISCOURSE DELIVERED BY PARLEY P. PRATT, IN THB TABERNACLE, GREAT SALT TAJKE CITY. I HOPE the congregation will lend us their undivided attention, and exercise their faith and prayers for those that speak, that the truth may be drawn out to the edi- fication of all. I always feel diffident to address the assemblies of the people of God, at- the seat of the government of the ' Church, knowing that there are many that can edify and enlighten our minds better than I can. I always feel that I would sooner hear than speak. But neverthe- less, I feel it my duty to impart my testimony, and exercise my gift among my brethren, according to my calling; I therefore shall address you for awhile this morning. There may be, many strangers assembled with us at this season of the year; many are passing through this city from diffe ent parts of the world. . The members of the Church 'need not complain, if I should address myself to the people as if they were all strangers, on the principles that are sometimes designated "MORMONISM ;" and confine myself to some of the plain, simple, intro- ductory principles of that system. It will refresh the minds of those acquainted with them, and perhaps edify them, and at the same time edify others.  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8190-00000197"/> 80              / Suppose I were to ask a question this morning, as a stranger, , What is Mormonism . "I suppose it is known to most men at all conversant with principles classed under that name, that it is a nickname, or a name applied to the public, and not used officially by the Church so called. Mormon was a man, a prophet, an author, a compiler, and a writer of a book. idtmon was .a teacher'of righteousness, holding certain doctrines The Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints are agreed with Mormon, as well as with many other ancient writers, and hold to the same principles; there- fore their neighbors have seen fit to call those principles : they holon, tmo MrOTISM.' 'ley might as well have  called rthem, Abrahamismno, Enocsm, or im because the ancient prophets,. patiarchs, and aapostles, held to the same truths in general terms, only differing in circumstances, in distant countries and ages of the world, Iand acted upon the same general principles, according to the particular circumstances that surrounded therm."ut the wrorld, out of all the ancients,. have selectedi one called -bormron, and all the principles held by all good inspired men of all ages and countries they have seen fif to sum up, and call "Mormonism."  Well, it is as well as anything else, for aught I know;  name does not affect the -principles.  The word'of God, as written in the good old Book, designates the people of dGod by the name of Saints;  which name is almost or ,quite as ancient, as any  writings extant. Saint was spoken of by Enoch long before the flood. The same term, was applied to the people of God by the prophets, the psalmist, and by  the writers of the New TestaMent.  Not only was this term applied to saints in ancient   MORMONISt.         81 days, but the patriarchs, prophets, and apostles applied it prophetically, speaking of the people of God in the latter days, when the kingdom should be given to the people of God, and the principles of God should bear rule over all the earth. Daniel and the other prophets, in-speaking of this subject, always call them the saints of the Most High. They do not call them "Mormon- ites," Methodists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Jews, Pagans, or Mohammedans, nor yet Catholics; but the language of the apostles and prophets is, that the SaINTS of the Most High shall prevail-prevail over the world, establish a true order of government, and, in short, rule the lower world; and that all the nations shall bow to him who is at their head, and to the principles held by them. Why riot this be continued and sustained, Oh ye peo- ple of Christendom, and, lettinig these party names go by the board, and be classed among the things that were in the darker ages, come to the proper and correct Scripture language, and when we speak of the people of God, call them SAINTs OF THE MOST HGH  Well, then, such is the name that the Church which I 'represent, do their business in. As such, they are known on their own records, and on the records of hea- ven, inasmuch as they are recognized there. But we know-what the worldd rean when they say "  Mormon- ism," and " 1 Mormon."  What are the principles called "Mormonism?." You'may ask those who profess to be instructors of the people abroad in the States, and else- where-'and very few of them will give you one correct idea in regard to the doctrines of the latter-day saints, Indeed, they have not informed themselves, but remain. 1n ignorance on the subject; and when they would  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8190-00000198"/> 82 show others, of course, they cannotinform thmc'orret] Ontatsbjc.    u you wil Ot i for tecorrcl onthatsubject. But youwzll generally be informed, that , /ormonism , is a new religion, that it i IsOme- tng new -under the sun, and of course is an innovation --a kind of trespass on Christianity on th ible,oton the good old way. "O!," ay Y some ofn thae -Bible9 toro     ). sysoe oft^ ou  riht to b e the most enlightened, and that-profess to be, /foronism  prevailS, hristianity will come down. Now suppose that we examine, principle by prlnciplr some of the fundamental principles of 'Mormonism,, and see whether there is one item that is newM or that is in any way an innovation on Christianity.

I need .not answer this question, neither need I bring Scripture to show what were the teachings and experience of Peter and the rest t of the apostles on this subject. The Bible is too com- mon a book, too, widely circulated in the world, and the people of the United States, especially, are too well read in its contents to suppose, for a moment, that Peter or the rest of the apostles would condemn a man because he believed in the ministration of angels, because he re-- lated an experience wherein he had had a vision of an angel. Now that was the principle that disturbed this genera- tion, in the -commencement of the introduction of that which is now called ' Mormonism"-a principle as com- *mon in the ancient church as the doctrine of repent- ance. I will say more--it is a principle that has been common in all dispensations; it is a principle which was had before the flood, and fully enjoyed by the ancient saints, or at least held to by them; a principle that was common among them; not that every man attained to it. But where can we read, under the government of the patriarchs, before the flood or after it; before Moses or after him; before Christ or after Christ--where can we read in sacred history of a people of God by whom the doctrine of visions and ministering of angels would be discarded, or be considered erroneous? It was common to all dispensations, it was enjoyed by the patriarchs and prophets under the law of Moses, before it and after it, and by the people of God among the ten tribes, and among the Jews. We will carry it still further. It was enjoyed among the Gentiles, before there was a people of God fully organized among them in the days of &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8190-00000199"/> 84         MORMONISM.  Christ. Cornelius had the ministering of angels before he became a member of the Christian Church, or under- stood there was a crucified and risen .Redeemer. He prayed to the living God, and gave alms of such things as he had. He was a good man, and an angel came to him and told him his prayers were heard, and his alms had come up as a memorial before God. It is astonishing then, to me, that the modern Chris- tian world consider this a new doctrine, an innovation-  a trespass -on Christianity.' No! it is as old -as the world, and as common among the true people of God, as His every day dealings with man. We will leave that point, and say, it is the Christian world, and not the latter-day saints, that have a new doctrine, provided they discard that principle.              - What next? Why, that man, by vision, the minister- ing of angels, and by revelation, should be called with a high and holy calling-commissioned with a holy mis- sion to preach, and teach, and warn, and prophesy, and call men to repentance. That was one of the first prin- ciples introductory to what is now called "Mormonism" in this age. Is there anything new about that, anything strange, anything that differs from the patriarchal ages, from  the Jewish economy, the Mosaic dispensation, or from the dispensation called Christian. Similar things hap- pened before Moses, in his day, and after his day; and among the prophets, and in different ages. Were not such things common in the days of Jesus Christ, and after that in the days of the apostles? Was not Johii the Baptist thus commissioned? Was not Jesus thus  commissioned. And were not His apostles, elders, and seventies? After 'is, resurrection and ascension into   MORMONISM.          -  Heaven, were not others called, and ordaied under the adse  of those-who were thus commissioned, and called ans,  o, th at twere mtus eomtata     n ,cetimes by visions and revelations directing them to hdie who were thus commissione d in order to be or- lained Th  at w asB no new doctrine, no innovation ol lhristianity, no pervers'i n of the Scriptural system , n or haos it anythio g new, unless yoD call the old principle Well, then, that the man thus commissioned should call upon others t tturnfrom their sins; and that an in- dividual, a government, a house, a city, a nation, or a  world of people srhoutldperish unless they did turn from their sins--is that anything ne w Nd. Every one con- versant with the Bible will say, that such things took place' frequently under all the different dispensations. The  heathen were warned in this way. Individuals, households, cities, nations, and the world have to be warned in this way, and especially under the Christian dispensation. So there was a spec ia cmmission given to the servants of :God, to go to all the world, andcall upon everybody to repent, or whole iations should be- come disfranchised, scattered, and millions be destroyed, as for instance the Jews at Jerusalem, because they would not hearken to it. It is nothing new, to cry to all men to repent, and warn different cities and nations of wars coming upon them, or that they will be damned if they do not repent. This is one of the early t rinci- paes called "Mormonism." Is there anything new in this Is thereanything strange or unscriptural  o; no sensible professing Christian will maintain such a point for a moment. Suppose that some people should hearken, whenthe ministering of angels takes place. Among many men  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8190-00000200"/> 86         MOlBMONI8M. one certain man is commissioned by revelation to preach the Gospel, and cry repentance. Suppose that some per- i sons should hearken and repent, -and he should take them and walk down to the water, and bury them in the water in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and raise them again out of the water, to representS the death and burial of Jesus Christ, and his resurrection from the dead; and to represent the faith i of the individual thus ministered to, that he does believe in Jesus Christ, that he died, and that he did rise from the dead, and that he, the individual, does put his trust and confidence in him for the remission of sins and eter- nal life-is that anything'new? Would that be new to Peter? Suppose some person was to relate before Peter and Paul to-day, and the Christians with them, that lived when they lived-suppose they were all present, and this person told them that a man came along preaching repentance, and he called upon us to believe in Jesus Christ, and we did so, believing their testimony, and they took us and buried us in water, and raised us again out the water unto newness of life-would Peter or John blame him? Would Paul say, "It is something new?" Or would he say, "Brother, thousands of us received the very-same thing in ancient days a" The Catholic Church profess to be the true church- the ground and pillar of the truth, handed down by regular -succession from the ancient church, of which they are still members; and their priesthood and apos- tles are now of the very same churchwhich the New Testament calls the true Qhurch %t Rome. These Roman Catholics of modern times profess to be members of that very same church that Paul wrote that epistle to. If they are, I will show you to demonstration, if the   8.7 MOMOliTI^ X.      . d M Scriptures be true, that this doctrine c alled "][o rmb n- ism is not a new doctrine, a u, writing to that cKnowc hurche of which they profess to be m emb ers, say s, Onow ye not, brethren, ye Romans, that as many of you as av e been baptized into Christ hav e been baptized into his death, being buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ rose from the dead, even so ye may walk in newness of life a Now this epistle containing this doctrine was written  au to the Church at Rome, and which these modern people called Roman Catholics profess to be members of. If they are what they profess to be, every one of them have been buried with Christ in baptism: and have risen again to newness of  life. We will, however, leave them to describe hether that is really the case, or whether they are con- tented to sprinkle a few drops of water on infant face and call that a burial! Paul said that was a prin- ciple of the true Church of Romne that had been buried with Christ by baptism into death, and had risen to new- ess of life. Have these modern Roman Catholics gone forward repenting of their sins, and been buried in forwater inthe likeness of Jesus Christ according to this pattern If they havenot they are a spurious Church of Rome, and not real. Therefore, if they be the real Church of Rome,:t wh be no new thing to them when the latter-day saints inforo them po being bur ed  with Christ in the likeness of his et. If this is a new doctrine to them, the hd better be looking about them to see if they have not got up a counterfeit abo Church of Rome, for Paul knew of only one, and the members of it were all buried with Christ in baptism If 500 persons here were to say they came repenting of their sin, and went down and were buried in the of thir si  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8190-00000201"/> -         , 88        M ORMONISM.  v waters of baptism, and had risen again to walk in new. I ness of life, Paul would say, if he were here, "It is just  what we used to do in ancient times; and I wrote to the Church of Rome, telling them that as many as were ' baptized into Christ were baptized into his death, buried with him by baptism into death," etc. Now if this doctrine is new to the Church of Rome, then that is that church, -that priesthood, and those i members that have introduced something new, who are departing from the old Christian religion, and not the "Mormons."    .    . . This reasoning applies just the same to the Church of  England. They have just as good a right to have a   Church in, England as anywhere else-tothave a national ! Church of England by law established, but if they are  a true Church of God, all of them have been buried with Christ in baptism, etc., or the apostle must have been mistaken, or there are two different kinds of Gos- , pel.                  i Now if I were speaking to the 'state Church of Eng- land, or the state churches of the Catholic world, I would tell them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to- repent of their new doctrine, and come back to the old standard spoken.' of by the Apostle, when be says, ' though we or an angel from heaven preach any other Gospel unto you than that which we have preadched unto you, let him be ,accursed," etc. I need not go through with this same application upon the Lutherans, upon the Presbyterians, upon the Methodists, and others,s for all these people sprinkle infants; for the principle once carried out will apply to the whole. If they are Christians according to the doc- trine of the ancient church, they hold the doctrine of   89 MOBMORMONISM..89 the aoatle, they have  repented of the ira d hsie en believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, ad  B  BIED with Christ by baptism into   not judge not, they may :judge' therseys, for I will not judge them If tey have got a new doctrine, different fro them.

"If Mormonism prev als, Christianity is in dangerZ for if it is a false mCirnstianity, the quicker it falls the better. We have examined three general principles, to see if there is anything new in Mormonism." First, the nistering of anls. Second, the commission of min- ministering of angels      to adnister in isters, apostles, prophets, and elders to administer aven. holy things, by revelation and the authority of heaven. Third, that all those that hear them, believe their words, and repent of their sins, shall go down into the waters of baptism, and be immersed or buried in the name of of baptism, and of the SOD, and of the Holy Ghost, and the Father      ,ufied and risen. thus show that they do believe in a crucified and isen Redeemer, and in the remission of sins through His naedeeme Sofar, thin-k, ave fairly stated some of the first principles of what the world calls "Mormon- ism ;" and every one hohas heard us, must decide that there is nothing new in these principles, but rather, that  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8190-00000202"/> those who have departed from them, are justly charge- able with introducing new things, and innovations on Christianity. - o    -          I Now 'suppose that one, two, or a dozen, or a hundred thousand, or even; millions of individuals thus baptized, should all come together, in their'several congregations, and should unite in earnest prayer, and a man commnis. sioned in the ministry of'Jesus Christ should rise and layi his hands on them, praying the Almighty God to give the Holy Spirit, and it be given as in days of old, and he confirms that promise upon them according to the pattern in the New Testament-would that be something new I W  ould it be an innovation -upon Christianity Would it be right to say " this is Mor- monism, come to do awaywith Christianity "Why no! Every sensible man, at all acquainted with the Holy Scriptures, would laugh at the idea. If the ancient saints were here, they would tell you it was their ancient manner; they would ask you if you had not read over their history, which describes how the :Holy Spirit was administered in days of old. Every man who has read the Bible, knows it. Well, then, the different sections of what is called Christianity, never do this, and call it something new. When the "  iMormons " do it, they are at once charged with innovation; and yet we have not got anything new in that respect, but 'simply a restoration of that which was. They arle the persons chargeable with new doctirie, and not the latter-day saints. , -Well, then, suppose that after this ordnance, the Holy Spirit falls upon these congregations, or upon these in- dividuals thus baptized and confirmed, and fills them and enlightens their minds, and bears testimonyto them  a   of the truth' which they have received, and confirms them in the faith of it, and fills them with the spirit of utterance and prayer, and with gifts whereby they. pro- phesy, or speak in tongues, lay hands on the sick and !?0 they recover, in the name- of Jesus, or whereby they are filled with the spirit of any gift, renewed in their"utter- ance, strengthened in their powers of intellect, so as to be able to speak with eloquence to the edification of others by the word of wisdom, knowledge and prophecy ; or perad- venture some one, two, or three of them have a heavenly vision, and happen to relate it-is this something new? Are these things an innovation on Christianity? Let the apostles of the ancient church. come up now, and be judges, not these innovators.. Oh yes, saints of ancient days, are these -things new to you  "No," they reply, (" but just exactly what we used to .lave among lus; and you who have read the New Testament know it is so. " If this, then, is Mormonism, it is no- thing new, but simply that which should have been in the world in order to constitute true Christianity. Now suppose, after all these have been established, the people organize on them; and that in the enjoyment and cultivation of them, this- people unite their efforts,  both temporally.,and spiritually, to build up themselves as a people, and each other as individuals, in righteous- ness upon the earth; and. the Spirit of the Lord God into which they were all baptized, should make them very great in union-in union of effect in counsel, in operation, in fellowship, in temporal things in a great measure, and in spiritual things, by which they are all of one heart and mind to a' great degree, and growing in it every day-is this something new, because it is "Mormonism V"  Or is this the very doctrine which  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8190-00000203"/> 92  MONM8lh;          l was inculcated in days of old by the apostles of Jesus Christ I' It was the main object for which the Holy Spirit was given, that they might all grow up in union, in fellow. ship, in co-operation, in holiness in the Lord. No mal who has read the New Testament, will say this is NEW when we say that the great object-of the Gospel is, that we may all become one in Christ Jesus-one in know. ledge, and in the love and practice of the peaceable things of God. Is it anything new 2 No. I Well, it is a part of what the world calls , MoRxosi;w; and I would to God it was more perfected among this people than it is. If any one of these principles in practice, should pre- vail over the whole Wvorldi it would be nothing new; but the world only hold this-last as a theory; as to the practice of it, they are strangers. We   have examined five or six general principles, called "Mormonism," and found nothing new in tlem. "But, says one, "I heard you had got a  new Bible; that is certainly an innovation." But stop; suppose, on inquiry, you become as much surprised and disappointed as many have who have asked for a "Mormon Bibles" and when we have presented them with one, behold it is King James' translation of the Scriptures, the stand- ard we read, containing the covenants, predictions, and hopes of the ancients, and the doctrines of Jesus Christ, just as we believe them, and hope for their fulfillment. Is that anything new? "Well, if you have not a new' Bible, you have certainly got a new book." Is that any thing strange? Have not other societies got new books The Church of England have not only the Scriptures, but the book   98   MRMXONISM.   of Common -Prayer, and the time was when they did not have such a book, therefore when they made that, it was something new. They are not alone in that, how- ever, for the Methodists have a new book called the "Methodist's Discipline." One hundred and twenty years ago there was no such thing in existence. If having a new book be an innovation, then all are guilty of it as well as the "Mormons." "But those other people do not profess that their books are inspired, and we have learned that you have a book that you believe is inspired. What is it, any how?" This is all a fact, and if it is wrong we will cheerfully plead guilty. We have got another book besides the Bible, that was an ancient. bk, and profess that it was inspired, and was written by prophets, and men that enjoyed the ministering of angels, more or less of them, and had communion with the heavens, and the spirit of prophecy. And moreover, we profess that this ancient book was restored to the knowledge of the modern world by inspiration, and the ministering of angels. Is that something new? It may be new to- the world in its history, and in its bearings; in that respect it may be new to them; but suppose, after all, it should contain no new doctrine, no new principle, no new pro- phecy, that is differing -from or doing away that which is already extant in the Bible I Well, then, I do not say that it would be a new doctrine. Men had books revealed in the days of old. "If it is no new doctrine, and if its predictions do not differ from those contained in the old apd new Testaments, what is the use of it?" The same question was inves- tigated in ancient times. A great conqueror had taken possession of an ancient library, when there were no  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8190-00000204"/> "         MORMONIM hr sa          I  printing presses, containing one. hundred thousand  volumes, all in manuscript, .comprising rmore history  than was in any library extant in the ancient world. SI The conqueror was a Mahomtnedan. lHe wrote to the head of the department to know what he would do with this library. It was invaluable in its cost and intrinsic worth. What shall I do with it?"  The reply was, "Ifit agrees with the Koran, we have no use for it; and M if it does not agree with the Koran, it is false anyhow; i so in either case burn it."  "Now if these latter-day saints have a book extant among them, and it agrees with the Bible, there is no kind of use for it," says the opposer, " for the Bible contains all that is necessary; if it does not agree with the Bible, it is false anyhow; so in either case burn it." This was a principle of Mahommedanism, and may be a principle of what is called modern Christianity. I hope not, however. "What is the use of the book in question, anyhow?" Why, in the first place, it differs in its history from the Bible. The Bible is a history of :things that took place in Asia principally, and a little'of what took place in Europe and Africa. The book of Mormon is a history of things in another hemisphere. The one book is the ancient history of the eastern hemisphere, in part; and the other is a history of the western hemisphere, in part. Si all we say, because we have the history of one part of the world, that the history of the other part of the world is good for nothing? Could the rulers of na- tions realize that fact, and could they only have a copy in their libraries at the cost of $100,000, they would appropriate it for this history of the western hemi- sphere.

These were the tidings, '"Go to all peo- ple." An angel must be a limited being, or be very ignorant in geographical knowledge, or partake largely of sectarian feelings of heart, to bear such tidings to one half of the globe, and not to the other. I knew an infidel once, that did not believe in the Christian religion, nor in the New Testament, nor in- the Saviour of the world. I asked him why he did not be- lieve this. " Because," says he, " according to the New Testament the manifestation of such an important affair was so limited. Hlere was half of the world, according to the New Testament, that never heard of it. A mes- sage so important should have been made more public.': "Well," said I, " if I will produce you a record, and a history, as well authenticated as the New Testament, showing that angels, the -risen Saviour, holy inspired prophets andapostles, ministered in the western hem- isphere, and preached the gospel to every creature, and handed it down, to ages, will you then believe " "Yes," he answered, " I will."  I presented him the Book of Mormon, which he perused. I inquired if he now believed. "Yes." he said, "I do;" and he has lived a Christian until now, for ought I know.

Were' there ships and steam vessels to bear them to this coun- try? No. Was there any communication kept up, or wanws this country known to them'? No. But the waves, and winds, and elements, and the great depths that in- tervened, even the unexplored-ocean, said to the ancient apostles, "Thus far shall ye go, and no further.' . This ocean, however, was no barrier to the fleet-footed angel of God, to the risen Jesus, and to immortal man They could come to this hemisphere, and reveal the things of heaven to the people, and could- rejoice in the same glad tidings, whether it was here or in Jerusalem, or if, it were in the uttermost parts of the earth. Though Peter was crucified at Rome, and Paul suf- fered in the sam emanner; though saints of the Most High were slaughtered by thousands and tens of thou: sands, and bled at the feet of Roman altars; yet a cruci- fled and risen Redeemer, angels of God, and the Hol] Spirit of truth that-ills all things, were not thus cur- tailed and limited, but could minister trhth to the utter- most bounds of the universe of God, where intelligences were mourning in darkness ; wherever the ravages of death had spread sorrow, wheierer there was a broken heart to be bound up, or-wherever there was'a despair- ing mortal to be inspired with hope, they could go and tell the glad tidings of life and salvation. The Book of Mormon says thiey did come to this continent. It is a history of their coming, and contains .the' doctrine taught to the people here by the risen Jesus, and by his predecessors. In short, the doctrine taught and prac-  omMOEMN6M.         99 tised in ancient America is there portrayed, together with the history of the people. Again, is this book of no interest with regard to the prophetic value? It reveals many things not noticed by the Jewish prophets. Did the old prophets touch upon every item that pertains to man in other countries? No, they did not, only in general terms together with the rest of the world. These other prophets portrayed many things not in their book, though agreeing with it as far as it goes, but touching events on which their book is silent. Has any person any cause to say that there has not been a multiplicity of revelations, testimony, prophecy, history and doctrine, developed in various countries by the same Spirit of God, and by angels? And is not all this of great worth, to compare, in order to blend it to- gether, that we may see mnore clearly the principles of the doctrines of salvation, and understand prophecy more extensively, especially in an age when the mind has been obscured by priestcraft. If these are the principles of "Mormonism," where can you point out an innovation on Christianity? But is this all? No, this is not all, and I shall not tell it all to- day. I do not -know it all yet. I have been twenty- three years learning '](Mormonism,"  and I know but little of it. If 'any one expects to learn all the doctrines of "  Mormonism," he must learn more than twenty-three years. For be it known unto you all, that " Mormon- ism," instead of being confined to a few dogmas or gen- eral truths, o'pens the flood-gates of all truth and knowl- edge, and teaches mankind to retain all the truth" they Can already comprehend,- and comprehend as much more as they can all the time.   &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC8190-00000207"/> 100        MORMONISM.  "Have you not other books?"Yes, we have histo- ries and compilations of the dealings of God with us as a people. We keep a record, if you must know, not only individually some of us, but as a church, as a body, or community. We have revelation penned, revelations and visions penned, we have revelation and prophecy penned, we have knowledge. penned, we have knowledge and principle penned,'we have plinciple -and history penned; the history comprising but a small portion, such as can be written, revealed to us latter-day saints, and practised upon; so that our modern books are like the ancient books--a mixture of revelation, prophecy, his- tory, and doctrine. Has any person any objections to this? I ask, should an angel administer to this or that man, or suppose an open vision was manifested to him, revealing many precious truths, would he not be a sim- pleton not to write it If the power of God, and the ministering of God, and the visions of the Almighty are extant in the world, these will be written. The practi- cal part of history will be writteiyfor if all were writ- ten, the world would not contain the books. The an- cient apo'stles and prophets wrote a few of the items re- vealed to them, and a history of the practical workings of the system over which they presided. Do we differ from them? No. "Well," says one, " to be'plain with you, Mr. Speaker, we have been taught to believe that the one book, called the Bible, contains all the revelations that God ever re- vealed to man, therefore- it is an innovation to offer any- thing else to the world as a revelation." This is a tra- dition of your own, so I have nothing to do with it. The Bible never taught that to you, nor angels, neither did any minister of God ever teach it to you ; and if it is a   MOBAONISMS. modern sectarian tradition, it is calculated to bind men into a cast iron creed, and the sooner you break the fet- ters the better; burst them asunder, and come out into liberty and freedom, and know and unders tand that there is no such doctrine in the broad principles of eter- nal truth, that heaven is full of knowledge, and the earth ought to be full of prophets, heaven and earth full of angels, andboth full of inspiration; and if the inhabit- antsof all the worlds of the universe were scribes, every blade of grass a pen, and every ocean ink, they could not write all the doings of the Almighty, of His servants, andof His angels. If I were to live for mil- lions of years to come, and then millions of millions more, I expect there would always be some being ready to reveal something new, and somecody would write it. The art of writing will never cease. We may not have pens and ink, but we may have something better. Suf- fice it to say, that the arts and sciences will not come to an end; yet man may have been traditionated to believe n end, yet man maay aGod ever said or that one small book contains a that God ever said or did. Such persons are to be pitied, and not to be rea- soned with. Whsontd is Mormonism." It is a restoration by new revelation, by the authorities'of heaven, by the minis- tration of angels, by the ordination of prophets and apostles, and ministers or elders, by their testimony and ministry on the earth, by the organization of saints, 'by the administration of ordinances, by the operations of the Holy Spirit; t is a restoration of these ancient principles revealed fro heaven, for the government of " s one, "You have said you are not going to tell the whole system to-day."

Your ma  ges," says the objector, " are fbunded upon principles entirely new, and different from the Christian world." say, without   any  cy I defy the world to estab- lish that assertion. Isay or marriage relations are nothing new at all. S  i nothiog new at all. There is no man, or set of men, or nation of men, where the Bible is extant, and they are readers, but what know that the institutions of' arriage contained in the Bible, and the organization of familie, differ widel from modern Christianity. W ediffer from modern Christianity, but not from the Bible. Patri- archs of the remotest ages, that obeyed the Lord od in regard to their marriages and familyVorganizations, have not disagreed with 1s, nor we with them, so far as we and they have obeyed the law of God. I  f thereis any difference at all , it was more developed among them han i i among us, we being in our infancy. If it should happen to be, thatthe whole modern world dif- fer from the Bible--have done away with the law of God, and we have come in contact with them, instead of with the word of G od  , then the boot is on the othe r foot, and in reaity w hat is said to Us applithe t m It is lik e the farmer and the lawyer.

"But ," said thefar- m  er, "I am mistaken, it w as thy bull that killed my   ox." " O," replied the lawyer, "that alters the case, and if-if-i-f--." Now, then, if it is the whole Christian world, from Catholicism down to the latest of her daughters, that have made void the law of God, and trampled under foot the institutions of heaven, the holy principles of matrimony and family government, and have made them void also, by their traditions, and introduced that which God never did; and "Mormonism" has restored the law of God, in theory and practice, then it is the so-called Christian world, and not us, that are wrong. Whether it regards family organization, the law of God, patriar- chal government, ordinances, principles and prophecy, I know of nothing new, or of nothing wherein we are innovators. As I said before, and I am able to maintain it when called upon, "Mormonism" is a system which was un- derstood and enjoyed by the ancients, and restored unto us by revelation. And if carried out, what will it do . It will simply fulfill the sayings of the prophets, both ancient and modern, put down all wickedness, abuse, proscription, -misrule, oppression, ignorance, darkness, and tyranny, and restore mankind to righteousness, truth, liberty, law and government, in which the Lord's will will be done on the earth as it is in heaven. That is what " ]Mormonism" will do, when carried out. May God bless you all. Amen.  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8190-00000209"/> 104a         dbMORKMOnTSM.          "EGITIMACY AND ITTEGITMAT. Y. A, SERMON DEIVERED BY ELDER JOHN TLO   , AT  SEWED^ EONFERENCE, IN THE TABERNACLE, REAT     SALT T AKE CITY.  IT rejoices my heart to hear the principles that have been advanced this-day by our President, because they have their foundation in truth, and based upon the prin- i ciplea of equity, and are calculated to promote the hap- piness, well-being, exaltation and glory of man, in time, and th-roughout eternity. Theey lead us back into eternity: they existed with us there, and in all the vari- ous stages of man's existenee they are calculated to ele- vate and  ennoble hinm; and place him in a proper position before. God, angels and men. They will put him in possession of his legitimate right, save him from ;he grasp of the adversar5y, froln every subtle strategem  )f the powers of darkness, and place him in his proper  itation in time and in eternity. I  have been much pleased with and edified by the emarks that have been made upon this stand during the onference. Wisdom has been displayed in them; from  hem the intelligence of heaven have beamed forth, the lysteries of eternityhave been spread before our minds, nd  .me have had a view of heavenlythings, that has IP -ur hearts with joy and our mouths with praise.   "EGITIMACY AND ILLEGITIMAIY.    105 It has made us feel as though we were upon the threshi- old of eternity; as though we were eternal beings, and had to do with eternal things ; as though the things of this world were short, fleeting and evanescent,. not worthy of a thought when compared with those things that are calculated to exalt and ennoble us in time and in eternity. The principles of justice, righteousness, and truth, which have an endless duration, can alone satisfy the capacious desires of the immortal soul. We may amuse ourselves like children do at play, or engage in the fri- volities of the dance. We may take our little enjoy- ments in our social assemblies, but when the man comes to reflect, when the Saint of God considers, and the visions of eternity are open to his view, and the unal- terable purposes of God are developed to his mind- when he contemplates his true position before God, angels and men, then he soars above the things of time and sense, and bursts the cords that bind him to earthly objects; he contemplates God and his own destiny in elhe economy'of heaven, and rejoices in a blooming hope of an immortal glory. Such have been some of our feelings, while our minds have been carried away from the things of earth to con- template the things with which eternal beings are asso- ciated, and the glories that await us in the everlasting mansions of the Gods. The principles that we have to do with, then, are eternal, and not simply to play a game upon the checker of mortality, on which people can win and lose for the time being. We have to do with that which shall con- tinue "'While life, and thought and beinig last, Or'immortality endures."   &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC8190-00000210"/> 106         MORMONISM. We seek not to build our hopes upon things that are  evanescent, fleeting and transitory. It is not he that can play the best game at checkers, that can take the most advantage of his neighbor, t]hat can grasp the most earthly good, or that can put llim- self in possession of anything his heart desires pertain- ing to time, that is the most happy; but it is he who does to that which will last, live and continue to abide with him while " immortality endures," and still be on the increase, worlds without end. If we can possess principles of this kind, then we are safe, everything else amounts to an illusion or a delusion, which cannot satisfy the desires of the mind, but, as the prophet says, it is like a thirsty man who dreams he is drinking, but when he awakes, he is faint, and his soul is thirsty; he dreams that he is eating, and when he awakes his soul is empty. This is the true situation of all men who are without God in the world; and nothing but a knowledge of eternal principles, of eternal laws, of eternal governments, of eternal justice and equity, and of eternal truth, can put us right, and satiate the appetite of the immortal soul. If we make not a just estimate of these things, it is in vain that we attempt to say, "Lord, Lord,'" because we do not the things which he says. Every thing associa- ted with the Gospel -of salvation is eternal, for it existed before the " morning stars sang together for joy," or this world rolled into existence. It existed then, just as it exists now with us, and it will exist the same wlhen time with us is no more. It is an eternal principle,: and every thing associated with it is everlasting. It is like the priesthood of the Son of God, "without beginning of days or end of years." It lives and abides for ever.

We have a Father, then, who is in heaven. He has placed us on this earth for some purpose. We foundl our- selves in posession of bodies, mental faculties, and reason- ing powers. In a word, we found ourselves intelligent beings, with minds capable of recalling the past and launching into the unborn future with lightning speed; and were it not for this earthly tabernacle, this tenement of clay, they would soar aloft and contemplate the un- veiled purposes of Jehovah in the mansions of the redeemed. We found ourselves here with minds capa- ble of all this and more. God, who has ordained all things from before the foundation of the world, is our Father. He placed us here to fulfill His wise and uner- ring counsels, that we might magnify our calling, honor our God, obtain an exaltation, and be placed in a more glorious,- exalted and dignified position than it would have been possible for us to enjoy if we had never taken upon us these bodies.

But, with these exceptions, the nations, kingdoms, powers, and dominions of the world have not been subject to the law, dominion, rule or, authority of God; but, as it is expressed by one of the ancients, the prince and power of the air, the god of this world has ruled in the hearts of the children of dis- obedience, and led them captive at his own will.

Go to any power that has existed upon this earth, and you will find that earthly government, earthly rule and dominion, have been obtained by the sword. It was the sword- of men that first put them-in possession of this power. They have walked up to their thrones through rivers of blood, through the clotted gore and the groans of the dying, and through the tears and lamentations of bereaved widows and helpless orphans; and hence the common saying is, "thrones won by blood, by blood must be maintained." By the same principle that they have been put in possession of ter- ritory, have they thought to sustain themselves-the same violence, the same fraud and the same oppres- sion have been made use of to sustain their illegiti- macy. Some of these powers, dominions, governments and rulers, have had in their possession the laws of God, and the admonitions of Jesus. Christ; and what have they done to his servants in different ages of the world, when he has sent them unto them? This question I need not stop to answer, for you are already made too familiar with it. This,. then, is the position of the world. Aui thority, dominion, rule, government has been obtained by fraud, and consequently is not legitimate. They say much about the ordination of kings, and their being anointed by the grace of God, etc. What think you of a murderer slaying hundreds and thousands of his fellow- creatures because he has the power, and while his sword is yet reeking with human blood, having a priest in sac- erdotal robes to anoint him to the kingship? They have done it.

If there has been such a nation, or if there is at tthis time such a government, it is a thing of which I am ignorant. The kings and potentates of the world profess to be anointed by the grace of God. But the priests who anoint them have no authority to do it. No person has authority to anoint a king or administer in one of the least of God's ordinances, except he is legally called and ordained of God to that power; and how can a man be called of God to administer in His name, that does not acknowledge the gift of prophecy to be the right of the children of God in all ages? It is impossible. These men have been grasping after power, and for this they have laid waste nations and destroyed countries. Some of them possessed it for awhile, and others were on the eve of getting it when they were cut off, and down they went. What became of them afterwards?  Isaiah in vision saw the kings of the ,earth gathered together as prisoners in a pit, and after many days they were to be visited. Having said so much in relation to other governors and governments, we will now notice the difference be- tween them and Abraham of old.- Abraham was a man who contended for the true and legitimate authority. God promised to him, and to his seed after him, the land of Canaan for their possession. "The Lord said unto Abraham, after that Lot was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art nortlihward, and southward, and eastward, and west- ward; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever." What did Stephen say generations afterwards? That God " gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on;   "5  XL  EGITIMAC Y A AN D ILLEGITIMAOTCY  t he promised that he would give it to hi n for a pos- ;sion , and to his seed after him, exen as yet he h sn ssiond ild to eel'vision of the dry bones explains this Aeming coL"A trac ton- The Lord said to him, S on of ,an, can these bones lv e" e tc.

Abraham and all his children  will then inherit the promises, through the principle of legitimacy. And there are many of the sons and daugh- ters of Abraham among us at the present time; these will be baptized for their dead brethren and sisters, and by this means bring them unto Christ, beginning on the outside branches of the tree, and so progressing to the main stock, and from that to the root. And it shall come to pass that all Israel shall be saved. Why? Be- cause it is their legitimate right. And they are Israel who do the works of Abraham. Thus it is, then, with Abraham. The old man feels perfectly easy about the matter; and if he does see many of his descendants existing as a cursed race on ac- count of their transgressions, many of them enjoying no higher, avocation than crying "old clothes," still the time of their redemption will come, and by means of the eternal Gospel and priesthood, they with us will be made perfect, and we with them. While the faithful are operating in heaven to bring this about, the saints are operating on earth; and by faith and works we will accomplish all things, we will redeem the dead and the living, and all shall come forth, and Abraham will stand at the head of his seed as their ruler. This is his legiti- mate position. We will now notice' those men who are contending for it without any authority, and make a contrast between the two. - We see them gathering their forces, and using their influence to destroy the poor among men. How long will the kings and rulers of the earth do this? Until they are dead and damned. And what   "7 X LW,ITIMncy AND iLLEGITIICY' " wna Theywillbecast down sinto a it. Isaiah saw all?

This was the case in ancient days, and has been car- ried on in modern times. I have, with my own eyes, seen holy prophets expire, who were killed by the hands of a murderous gang of blood-thirsty assassins, because they bore the same testimony that the holy prophets did in days of old. How many more of their brethren who dared to acknowledge the truth, have fallen beneath the same influences--have been shot, whipped, imprisoned, and put to death in a variety of ways, while hundreds of others, driven from their homes in the winters, have found their last bed; they wereworn out with suffering and- fatigue, the weary wheels of life stood still; they were obliged to forsake the world, in which they could no longer remain, because of the persecution heaped upon them by the enemies of the truth. The reason of all this vile outrage upon inn cent m en women and children, is because there is no legitimate rule upon the earth. God's laws and governmen.t are no   t known, and His servants are despised and cast out. Legitimacy and right, whether in heaven or on earth, cannot mix with anything that is not true, just and equitable; and truth is free from oppression and  injus- tice, as is:tlle bosom of Jehovah. Nothing but that will ultimately stand. What has been the positionof the world generally, arnong- themselves ? Y ou  see men marshalling armies, and making war with one another to destroy each other, and take possession of their terri tory and wealth. One man who is in possession of wealth, power and authority, sees oppression exercised by   "EGUITMACY AND ILLEGITIMACY.     19  kings; so he follows the example, as do rulers who exercise authority under their sovereign; then others in a still lower degree do the same; thus oppression treads upon the heels of oppression, and distress follows dis- tress. You will find' this to exist in a great measure through every grade of society, from the king on his throne, down to the match-maker or the chimney- sweep. To ameliorate the condition of man, there are a great many institutions introduced into the world in the shape of Tract Societies, Bible Societies, and many more too numerous for me to name. Many of them are founded by sincere men, but commencing on the wrong founda- tion, they keep wrong all the time, and fail to accomplish% the object desired. If any one of these different insti- tutions wlere to carry out their own principles, they would not only fail in accomplishing the object they have in view, but ultimately destroy themselves. There are Peace Societies among the rest; their object is to bring peace into the world, without the Spirit of God. They see plainly that peace is desirable, but they wish to graft it on to a rotten stock. In Europe they had a "Peace Congress," and sent their representatives to all parts of the world; and of course this "Congress of Peace " wished to regulate the world, make an end of war, and bring iu universal peace. Talk about peace, when rancorous discord makes its nest in the councils and cabinets of all nations, and the hearts of thdir statesmen are steeped in hatred one to another! Jealousy, animosity and strife, like the influ- ence of a deadly contagion, may be found in almost every family; brother rising up against sister, sister against brother, thb father against the mother, and the  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8190-00000217"/> 120  129   --     MORMONISM.            mother against the father, etc. We can find discord reigning even in the "Peace Society " itself.  Jesus Christ says, "My peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you," etc. Wherever this peace exists, it leaves an influence that is comfo .t- ing and refreshing to the souls of those who partake of it. It is like the morning dew to the thirsty plant. This peace is alone the gift of God, and- it can only be received from Him through obedience to His laws. If any man wishes to introduce peace into lis fnily r  among his friends, let him cultivate it in his own bosom; for sterling peace can only be had according to the legiti-  imate rule and authority of heaven, and obedience to its laws, Everything is disordered, and in confusion in the world. The reason is, because no legitimate authority has been known or acknowledged on the earth. Others have been trying to build up and establish what they supposed to be the kingdom of God. The socialists of France call themselves religious people, and they also expect to bring about a reign of glory through a species of Robespierreism. I was told by a man well acquainted with matters of fact in relation to these things, that if they gained the ascendancy in France, their first object would be to erect a statue to Robespierre. They were going to cut off thousands of people, to accomplish their designs; and had not -Napoleon taken active measures to head them, bands of men were ready on a moment's warning to cut Off the heads of thousands, and among these, I  was informed, fifty thousand priests were doomed. These are some of the principles and ideas that exist in the world, among the various nations and institutions of   "EGITMACY ND ILLEGITIMACY.   12" men, which are framed according to illegitimate princi. ples. Aehange of government changes not the condition of the people, for all are wrong, and acting without God. Our ideas are, that the time has come to favor God's people; a time about which prophets spoke in pathetic strains, and poets sung. These men of God looked through the dark vista of future ages, and being wrap- ped in prophetic vision, beheld the latter day glory-the time of -the dispensation of the fullness of times, spoken of by all the holy prophets since the world began; for they all looked forward with joyful anticipations to the things which have commenced with us; they all had their eye upon the time when legitimacy would obtain its proper place upon the earth, in the shape of the kingdom of God established in the world, when all false rule and doniinion would be put down, and the kring- doms of this world would become subject to God and His Christ. These are the ideas that they had, and theae are the things we are seeking to carry out. If we look at what illegitimacy has done in former times, we shall see the absolute necessity of the restitu- tion spoken of by the prophets, fpr it has filled the earth with evil, it has caused the world to groan in bondage, laid millions in the cold embrace of death, and caused disease to spread its pestiferous breath among the na- tions, leaving ruin, misery and desolation in its path, and made this fair earth a howling wilderness. And nothing but ithe wisdom and intelligence of God can change it. The kingdom of God will establish truth and correct principles-the principles of truth, equity and justice; in short, the principles that emanate from God,   &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC8190-00000218"/> 122  principles that are calculated to elevate man in time and through all eternitv. How shall this be Iwill be by a legitimate rule, authority and dominion. Wio have we for our ruling power? Whereandhow did he obtain his authority Or how did any of this Church and kingdom obtain it-? It was first obtained by a revelation from the Lord of the universe, by the talking about mis-rule and mis-government. If there is any form of government under the heavens where we can have legitimate rule and authority, it is among the Saints. Inthe first place, we have a man appointed by God, and, in the-second place, by the people. This man is chosen by yourselves, and every person raises his hand to sanction the choice. uHere is our President Brigham Young, whom we made choice of yesterdays who is he? He is the legitimate ruler  among this people. Can anybody dispossess him? They- cannot, because it is his legitimate right, and he reigns in the hearts of the people. ie obtains his  authority first from God, and  secondly from the people; and if a man possesses five grains of common sense, when he has a privilege of voting for or against a man, he will not vote for a man that oppresses the people; he will vote according to the dictates of his conscience, for this is the right a nd duty of this people in the choice of their Presi- dent, and other leading officers of the kingdom of God. While thiis s being done here, it is being done in every part  of the w orld, w herever the Church of Jesus Christ   "EGITIMACY AND ILLEGITIMAOY.   -123   of latter-day saints has a footing. Is there a monarch, -potentate or power under the heavens that undergoes a scrutiny as fine as this . No, there is not; and yet this is done twice a year, before all the Psaints in the world. Here are legitimacy and rule.. You place the power in their hands to govern, dictate, regulate and put in order, the affairs of the kingdom of God. This is Vox Dei vox populi. God appoints; the people sustain. You do this by your own act; very well, then, it is legitimate, and must stand, and every man is bound to abide it if it takes the hair off his head. I know that there are things sometimes that are hard, tough and pinching; but if a man is a man of God, he has his' eyes upon eternal things, and is aiming to accomplish the purposes of God, and all will be well with him in the end. What advantage is there, then, between this govern- ment and others? Why we have peace, and as eternal beings we have knowledge of eternal things. While listening to the remarks made on this stand, what have we not heard--what have we not known? The curtains of heaven have been withdrawn, and we have gazed as by vision upon eternal realities. While, in the profess- ing world, doubt and uncertainty throw their dark mantle over every mind. Let us now notice our political position in the world. What are we going to do-  We are going to possess the earth. Why? Because it belongs to Jesus Christ, and he belongs to us, and we to him; we are all one, and will take the kingdom and possess it under the whole heatvens, and reign over it for ever and ever. Now, ye kings and exmAperors, help yourselves, if you can. This is the truth, and it may as well be told at this time as at any other.  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8190-00000219"/> 124       o 4MORMONISMf.  "There's a good time coming, Saints,    A good time coming, There's a good time coming, Saints,.  Wait a little longer."  Having said so much on this point, we will return to - the principle of legitimacy. God is our legitimate Fa- ther, and we are HiIs children, and have a claim upon Him, and'He has a claim upon us. We have come into  this world to accomplish a certain purpose, and we haveinto  come in the dispensation of the fullness of times, when  whether they be things in heaven or on earth; and everything that has been' in existence in any age of the world, or that is, or will be, which is calculated to benefit and exalt men, we shall have; consequently, it is for us to look after anything and everything that ever has been true, or that eve has been developed in any  period of the history of man, for it all belongs to us, and ' has got to be restored, for restittion means bringing back that which was lost. If the antedeluvians enjor- ed anything that Was good, true and eternal, which is  not yet made known to us, it has to be restored; or if  anything existed among the ancient patriarchs and pro- phets, that has been lost, it has to be restored. There are any people of God upon any       th any detached part of this world, they with it have got to be restored. God's word  will also be gathered into one, and His -people and thile Jews will hear the words of the Nephites, and the ten ttibes must hear the words of theJews  ad Nephites, n and God's people be gathered and be one. All things will be gathered in one, and Zion be redeemned, the story of God be revealed, and all flesh see it together.  God's dominion will be established on the earth, the    "EGITIMACY AND ILLEGITIMACY.   125      law go forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem, and the kingdoms of this world will become subject to God and His Christ. As eternal beings, then, we existed with our Father in the eternal worlds. We came on to this earth, and obtained tabernacles, that through taking possession of them, and passing through a scene of trial, and tribula- tion, and suffering, we might be exalted to more glory, dignity and power, than, would have been possible for us to obtain had we not been placed in our present position. If any of you do not believe this, let me refer you to a passage of Scripture or two. How was man created at first'? We are told that God made man a little lower than the angels ; then says Paul, "Know ye not that we shall judge angels." What through? It is through the atonement of Jesus Christ, through the taking of our bodies, the powers of the holy priesthood, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ, that we shall obtain a higher exaltation than it would have been possible for us to enjoy, if we had not fallen. To do right in our present state, then, we must carry out the principle of legitimacy according to a correct rule, and, if we profess to be subjects of the kingdom of God, we must be subject to the dominion, rule, legitimacy, and authority of God. No person can escape from this un- less he apostatizes, and goes to the devil, like a fool. He must be a fool who would barter away eternal life, thrones, principalities and powers in the eternal world, for the paltry trash which exists in the shape of wealth and worldly honor; to let go his chance of heaven and of God, of being a king and priest unto Him, of living and reigning for ever, and standing among the chiefs of Israel. I cannot help calling such men fools, for they  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8190-00000220"/> v26        MORMONISM B are damned now in meaking such choice, and will be hereafter.  I will say a little more on legitimacy and right to rule. What would be the position of a man who would take a course to rob his neighbor, or take advantage of him in the case of his legitimacy, which you have heard of this morning.' S.uch a man must be a greater fool than the other   For instance, a good man dies, who has served God in righteousness all his days; -the weary wheels of life stand still,'and he goes to the world of spirits: HIe believed in the principles of justice, equity, rightebusness, anmdtruth, and that his rights would be :held sacred to him  by his brethren  after he was gone. But some professed man of God comes to his widow, and wants to steal her away from  him; he would rob the dead with impunity, under the ostensible garb of justice to her and her dead husband; he will tell her he is doing it Out of pure love to them both, and he is going to exalt them in the kingdom of God.  We read of the kingdom of God suffering violence; if violence is ever attempted, it is in a case of this kind. It is bad enough to steal from a  man his earthly property; his oxen, his cow, his horse, his harness, his wagon wheels, and other paraphernalia; but what think you of a man that would rob the dead  of a  treasure which he holds the most dear, and prized as the most precious thing he possessed on earth--his affectionate wife! . Such a person will assur- edly miss his figure.     ' You will find in the ancient laws of Israel,'there were proper-rules in.relation to these matters; one was, that if a   man died without a  child, his brother or the nearest relation of the husband should take the widow, and raise up seed to the husband, that his name might be continued   "EOITIMAOY AlNI ILLEGITIMACY.    127 in Israel, and not be blotted out. Where did these laws come from?  We are told they came from God.   But instead of doing this, suppose he should try to steal this woman away, and rob his brother-how would he- get along, I wonder, with such a case against him, at the bar of justices? The laws and ordinances that exist in the eternal world have -their pattern in the things which are revealed to the children of men on earth.  The priest- hood as it exists on the earth is a pattern of things in heaven.  As I said in former part of this discourse, priesthood is legitim' rule, whether on earth or in heaven. When we have the true priesthood on earth, we lake it with us into, the heavens; it changes not, but continues the same in the eternal world. There is another feature of that ancient law which I will mention. It was considered an act of injustice for the nearest relation not to take the wife of the deceased  if he refused to do it, he was obliged to go before the elders of a Israel, and his brother's wife shall loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall an- swer and say, So shall it be done unto the man that will not build up his brother's house; and his name shall be called in. Israel, The house of him who hath his shoe loosed." If the restitution of all things is to be brought to pass, there must be a restitution of these things; everything will be-put right, and in its proper place. There is another thing which is most grievous, afflict- ing and distressing so contemplate. When a man takes to himself a, woman that properly belongs to another, and defiles her, it interferes with the fountain of life, and corrupts the very source of existence. There is an offspring comes forth as the fruit of that union, and that  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8190-00000221"/> 128  8MORMONISM.  offspring is an eternal being-how can it be lobked upon .To reflect upon it, wounds the finest feelings of human nature in time and will in eternity. For who can gaze upon the degradation of their wife, and the corruption of their seed, without peculiar sensations? How much more is this pr ing enhanced when the wronged man considers that hope has been robbed by one who professed to be his friend  This thing is motto be tried with, but is of the greatest importance; hence the necessity of the sealing powers, that all things may be pure, chastity maintained, and lasciviousness be rooted out from among the saints. Why so a That we may have a holy offspring, that shall be great, and clothed with the mighty power of God, to rule in His kingdom, and accomplish the work we propose they shall filfill; and that when we go to sleep, we mav sleep in peace, knowing that justice will be administered in righteousness. We shall know that we have a claim upon our own in the first resurrection; we shall know  that our wives and our children will be there to join us, justice will be administered, and we shall have a claim upon them in the eternal world, and that no unprincipled - scoundrel will be pernitted to set his foot on another, or  rob him of his just claims. Why is a woman sealed to a man for time and all eternity? Because there is legi- timate power on earth to do it. This power-will bind on earth and in heaven; it can loose on earth, and it is - loosed in heaven; it can seal on earth, and it is sealed in heaven. There is a legitimate,' authorized agent of God - upon earth; this sealing power is regulated by him; hence what is done by that, is done righf, and is record- Ad.

Let us do righteously, and you who would seek to in- jure another, and take advantage of one who was just and faithful to his God in his day, how would you like, when you get a few years older and drop into eternity, for somebody to come and serve you the same?

We have been told to preach confidence; correct principles and just dealings alone will inspire it. If a man speaks- that which is not true about another, can you have confidence in him? No. If a man defrauds another, can you have confidence in him? No. But if you would, through a principle of covetousness, seek to' sap the foundation of another's happiness, by trying to wrench from him those sacred rights which pertain to his interest in the eternal world, how much greater will be your condemnationI Nothing but truth, integrity, virtue, honor, and every pure principle, will stand in the great day of God Almighty. If such a person happens to get through this world, he will find barriers in the oxt, and probably miss a chance of obtaining a place I the firsts resurrection. Nothing contrary to the au- thority, rule, and government of heaven, will stand in time or in eternity; and if any man wants to be blessed and honored, and to obtain a high place in the eternal world, let him pursue a course of honor, righteousness,  &#xD;<pb n="130-131 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC8190-00000222"/> 130 MORMONISM. and virtue before his God; and if he wants to find him. self amongst usurpers, defirauders, oppressors, and those in possession of illegitimate claims, let him take an op: posite course.. If time would permit, much more might be said about social, family and individual legitimate rights; bu1t as time hastens, I forbear for the present. Well, brethren and sisters, may God bless you.
