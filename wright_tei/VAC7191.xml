                  District of New York.</edition>

            <head>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A PREFACE is generally considered to be a necessary appendage to a book. It is true
               that some readers pass it over with a psha! indicative of contempt; nevertheless
               there are others who would consider a book incomplete without it.</p>
            <p>In the following story the author has endeavored, under the garb of fiction to embody
               various romantic facts, which have come under his notice in the course of his early
               wanderings. He does not pretend to insult his readers by asserting that he has
               strictly adhered to literal facts. The veriest tyro in romance reading would know
               that this were impossible, even if it were desirable. No person, even in recounting
               historical truths, can adhere to the letter of actual fact. Such and such things he
               may know to have occurred at certain periods. It rests with him to show in what way
               they were brought about; to relate a conversation here, to speak of a fact which
               happened there, and, so to speak, to dovetail the fiction and the fact together in
               such a manner that the one may reasonably bring about, or explain the cause of the
               other, and according to the skill with which he has effected this depends the
               excellence of his work. Whether or not, in the present instance, the author<pb
                  n="iv-v" xml:id="VAC7191-00000004"/> has succeeded, he leaves to the judgment of
               his readers. With regard to the plot of the story, the following explanations as to
               the origin of some of the characters may be acceptable.</p>
            <p>Some years since, it was the fortune of the author to fall in with a sea captain
               whose characteristics he has endeavored to portray in his delineation of Seymour.
               This erratic individual commanded a ship of his own, and during his early
               peregrinations he had fallen in with, purchased, educated, and eventually married a
               Greek girl, almost literally under the circumstances detailed in the narrative.
               Guided by eccentricity in all his actions, he resolved, as much as possible, to
               isolate this lady from society, and he actually kept her for many years almost
               secluded from the world. The author met her on board her husband's ship, and was much
               delighted with her extraordinary personal beauty and the innocence and amiability of
               her disposition, as was every one who saw her. She, some few years after her
               marriage, came to an untimely end, and her husband, who really loved her to
               distraction, did not long survive her.</p>
            <p>With regard to those portions of the story which illustrate the method of slave
               dealing on the African coast, the author has merely presented disconnected facts in a
               connected manner. King Kettle and the Loango Chiefs, are living illustrations of the
               native slave dealers on the coast, and their portraiture is drawn from life—"nothing
               extenuate."</p>
            <p>As to the character of Mr. Mordant the author has endeavored to portray the
               vraisemblance of one of those men, by no means scarce in our community, who, while
               professing to be actuated by philanthropy in their hatred of the system of southern
               slavery and their open admiration of the principles of abolitionism, are really and
               truly interested in procuring slaves for the Cuban market, and it is a well known
               fact, that vessels have cleared from this and other ports, with false papers, whose
               destiny was to the coast, for the purpose of procuring negroes.</p>
            <p>The author has not ventured to discuss the question of slavery, as it at present
               exists in this country. He is fully aware that all argument on that subject is vain,
               and that very much evil has arisen from the ill directed zeal of Abolitionists, whose
               efforts only seem to exasperate the slaveholder and to bind faster the fetters of the
               slave. Slavery as it at present exists in the southern portion of this Union is an
               evil that can never be eradicated by violent diatribe, and it is equally as certain
               that the efforts made to prevent the kidnapping of negroes from Africa, have led and
               do lead still to greater hardships being inflicted upon the unhappy wretches thus
               ruthlessly torn from their homes, although the use of steamers upon the coast has
               rendered, of late years, the practice of slave catching, more hazardous than it has
               been heretofore.</p>
            <p>The Cabin Boy, in this narrative has told his own story, very little varnished, or
               exaggerated; he has had little occasion to do so; for to use a hackneyed yet
               veritable phrase, "Truth is strange—stranger than fiction."</p>
            <p>With this explanation, he gives the story to his readers.</p>

                  <p>Ho! for California—Shipping Hands for the new El Dorado.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE astounding discovery of the auriferous treasure buried beneath the soil of the
                  long-considered barren desert of California, created an unwonted stir amongst the
                  shipping in the port of New York, as well as in every other port in the United
                  States; for every merchant, who could by any means manage to do so, was eager to
                  possess himself of a share of the almost fabulous wealth then for the first time
                  laid bare to the cupidity of mankind; consequently all the vessels that could be
                  obtained, were readily freighted for the shores of the "land of golden promise."
                  Freights increased in value—there was a rise in seamen's wages—a scarcity of
                  seamen for every other destination, and a proportionable increase in everything
                  connected with the shipping interest.</p>
               <p>One fine summer's evening, shortly after the news had burst upon the world, and
                  men had satisfied themselves that they were not dreaming or listening to an
                  exaggerated story, there was an unusual bustle in a well known shipping office for
                  seamen, in the vicinity of the East River; for the proprietor had within a few
                  days received almost unlimited requisitions from divers ship-owners and masters,
                  to procure crews for their vessels. The office was thronged to excess with seamen,
                  "Outward bounders," as, in nautical parlance, Jack is termed, when he has run his
                  tether to its full length ashore, and having spent the hard earned wages of
                  months, and sometimes of years, in a few days, finds himself snubbed by his
                  landlady and<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7191-00000009"/> looked shy upon by the fair,
                  but frail nymphs, in the sunshine of whose favors he so lately basked.</p>
               <p>But, strange to say, there was not that seeming anxiety amongst the men to get a
                  berth, almost without regard to the place of their destination, that was customary
                  when the throng was so great. The hardy fellows rather seemed to hang back—albeit,
                  they had not "a shot left in the locker"—and to feel a desire to pick and choose
                  with all the nicety and independence of a cautious "Homeward bounder," determined
                  to take warning from past follies and mishaps, and go to sea again before his
                  pockets had been drained by land sharks in the shape of landlords, tavern keepers,
                  sharpers, long-shore-men, cyprians <foreign xml:lang="LAT">et hoc genus
                     omne.</foreign> Let us listen awhile to what was going on, and we may be able
                  to understand how this happened. A stout, burly, black whiskered, weather-beaten,
                  and yet, withal, good-tempered looking man, walked into the office, elbowed his
                  way through the crowd of sailors, and approaching the shipping master, said, "Good
                  morning Mr. Sharply—have you got my crew all ready? We haul out at four o'clock
                  this afternoon, and I must have the men all on board by that time."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to say captain," replied the shipping master, "that there are six
                  hands wanting yet. 'Pon my word, in all my experience I never saw such a
                  difficulty in procuring sailors for these northern voyages." Then, raising his
                  voice, and addressing the assembled seamen, he shouted—</p>
               <p>"Now, lads, who's for a trip to Antwerp in the 'Mermaid?'—Fine ship—A—1—good
                  captain—first rate provisions—tiptop wages, and a capital time of year for the
                  voyage. Six hands wanted, at two dollars a month above ordinary wages."</p>
               <p>There was no reply to these tempting offers. Two or three men seemed half-inclined
                  to come forward; but they drew back again—a low conversation was kept up amidst
                  the throng for a few minutes, and then all was silent.</p>
               <p>The captain and the shipping master both looked disappointed, but in the course of
                  a few minutes, the former left the office saying <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto
                     voce</foreign> to the shipping master, as he turned to go away—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Sharply, you <emph>must</emph> get me six men by four o'clock, by hook or by
                  crook—some way or other; even if you have still to increase the wages."</p>
               <p>Scarcely had the captain of the Antwerp ship left the office before another
                  captain entered. He saluted the shipping master familiarly, and asked if his crew
                  was ready.</p>
               <p>"Hardly yet," replied the latter smiling, "hardly yet, captain. I only received
                  your order an hour ago—but I shall have no difficulty in procuring you a
                  first-rate crew immediately."</p>
               <p>"Who wants to go to San Francisco," continued he, addressing the sailors, "I want
                  fourteen hands for the Flying Fish, to sail to-morrow morning?"</p>
               <p>Scarcely had the words escaped his lips, before there was a rush to the desk of
                  twice the number of hands wanted, all eager to register their names for the
                  voyage. The requisite crew was soon procured, and it was not until the day began
                  to grow late, and there appeared no more prospect of any fresh calls for
                  California voyages, that any desire was expressed to ship on board other vessels.
                  Then, however, the men who were left, thrust their hands disconsolately into their
                  empty pockets, and began to think of the cool reception they were likely to meet
                  with at their boarding-houses, and after some cogitation, reluctantly expressed
                  their readiness to take such chances as still offered themselves, and by this
                  means, the requisite crews for the less popular voyages were procured.</p>
               <p>The office was considerably thinned of its numbers; indeed, but very few remained,
                  and most of these rather stayed from curiosity, than from any immediate desire to
                  procure ships, and the shipping master was beginning to think of closing his
                  office for the night, for it was growing dark, when a tall, dark, and exceedingly
                  handsome young man, a seaman evidently—his bronzed complexion told that—but having
                  the martial bearing of an officer of the navy, rather than a merchant captain,
                  entered the office.</p>
               <p>He saluted the shipping master as the others had done before him, and then put the
                  same question to him with regard to his crew—</p>
               <p>"No, Captain Seymour," replied the shipping master, "since you are so extremely
                  particular with regard to the crew you wish to ship, I had rather that you would
                  pick out the men yourself. If you will call to-morrow, I will have some that I
                  think will suit you on hand, and will then let you explain matters to them. Let me
                  see, you are bound to——"</p>
               <p>"To—Acapulco—and—and to California," replied the captain, with a strange
                  hesitation in his speech. "You know the kind of men I want; none of your
                  milksop—half and half fellows—but thorough sea dogs—every one of them; fellows
                  that will stand any hardship, and do any amount of fighting, if it be
                  necessary."</p>
               <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7191-00000010"/>
               <p>"I understand you, Captain Seymour," replied the shipping master; and I have had
                  my eye for some days past on just such a set of men as you require; but, as I said
                  before, you had better call in the morning and arrange matters for yourself."</p>
               <p>"I will do go," replied the captain; and wishing the shipping master "Good-night,"
                  he left the office.</p>
               <p>Just before the last-mentioned captain had entered, a young, delicate-looking, but
                  very dark-complexioned lad had joined the crowd of seamen. He was evidently
                  anxious to procure a berth, and was about to press forward to the shipping
                  master's desk, when, observing Captain Seymour, he was apparently seized with a
                  nervous timidity, which had been sufficiently manifest before to attract the
                  notice, and call forth the coarse jokes of the rude seamen who were standing near
                  him, and he shrunk back again in a corner, evidently endeavoring to escape notice.
                  He had not been perceived by the shipping master, and yet it appeared that he had
                  been a previous applicant at the office for a berth, for after the captain had
                  retired, the shipping master, as he stepped down from his desk to clear out and
                  close the office, recognised him, and said—</p>
               <p>"Ha! Davis—you here? I didn't see you before. Wait a moment till I close the
                  shutters. I want to speak with you."</p>
               <p>The lad did as he was desired; and when the shipping master had closed all up, he
                  returned to his desk, lit a candle, and called the lad to him.</p>
               <p>"You want to go to California, you say, Davis. I have two or three crews to ship
                  for vessels bound for San Francisco, tomorrow or next day; be on hand, and perhaps
                  I may be able to get you a berth. You have been to sea before?"</p>
               <p>"No Sir!" timidly replied the lad, "that is to say," he continued, "I have once
                  made a voyage to and fro between New York and Liverpool."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Why, to look at your sun-burnt face, one would have thought you had been
                  a cruise to the West Indies, or some part of the tropics. Well, come to-morrow,
                  and I will see what can be done."</p>
               <p>"I should like to get a berth on board the Albatross," said the lad.</p>
               <p>"On board the Albatross! Why, my boy, I think you are hardly fitted to make one of
                     <emph>her</emph> crew. Why did you not speak to Captain Seymour when he was
                  here just now?"</p>
               <p>"I was afraid," replied the lad, "I wish you would speak for me. I did go and ask
                  the mate, and he told me you had the shipping of the crew."</p>
               <p>"Why not any other vessel bound to California, as well as the Albatross?"</p>
               <p>"I have taken a fancy to go in the Albatross with Captain Seymour," replied the
                  lad, blushing deeply through his bronzed cheeks as he spoke, although the
                  shipping-master did not perceive the blush.</p>
               <p>"Well, I will do what I can for you, for I like your looks; but I can give you but
                  little hope; however, come here at nine o'clock to-morrow morning, and I will
                  speak to Captain Seymour about you. You might answer for his cabin boy,
                  perhaps."</p>
               <p>The youth left the office, and proceeded to his boarding house, which was not one
                  of those frequented by seamen, but one of a superior sort, where he had had
                  possession of a room for a week. He walked on with hurried steps, holding his head
                  down, and striving apparently to escape notice. The shipping master observed this,
                  for he had closed the office and was following the youth at a short distance.</p>
               <p>"There is something mysterious about that boy," he said to himself—"It's my belief
                  he's running away from home. His looks show that he comes of a better class than
                  sailor boys in general. Some young scamp, I suppose, who has taken a freak into
                  his head, which a rough voyage or so will soon put out again; however, he's a
                  smart-looking boy—strange he should so particularly desire to go in the Albatross.
                  I should hardly think <emph>he</emph> would be of much use on board
                     <emph>her;</emph> still, I'll give him a chance."</p>
               <p>On the following morning, according to appointment, the captain of the Albatross
                  called at the shipping office and selected his hands, and a hard, ill-favored
                  looking set they were, and an uncommonly numerous crew the captain shipped. When
                  at length he was satisfied, the shipping master directed his attention to the boy,
                  who had called as he had been directed on the previous evening, but who,
                  notwithstanding his anxiety to ship on board the Albatross, had kept himself in
                  the back-ground, as though he shrunk from the ordeal of examination. "Oh, by the
                  bye, captain, now you are satisfied with your crew, do you think you can find room
                  for this lad; he has a particular desire to sail in the Albatross."</p>
               <p>"I don't think he'll be of much service to me," replied the captain, "I want no
                  more hands on board my ship than can catch mice." He was turning away when he
                  appeared struck with something in the appearance of the boy, for he gazed at him
                  earnestly and inquired, "What is your name, boy?"</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7191-00000011"/>
               <p>"Henry Davis, sir."</p>
               <p>"Well, Henry, I may want a lad to mix my grog for me, in fine weather. I don't
                  suppose for some time to come, you'll be much use; but I will give you a berth as
                  cabin boy. What say you—will that suit you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied the youth, his eyes beaming with delight, "I shall be glad to
                  accept the berth."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, be in readiness with the rest of the crew this afternoon; or stay, is
                  your <emph>kit</emph> all ready?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"Well then, go on board at once, and tell the mate I sent you."</p>
               <p>The youth did as he was desired, and in the evening of the same day the Albatross
                  was hauled out into the stream. Two or three loungers on the pier wondered to
                  themselves what a vessel bound to Acapulco and California, needed so many water
                  casks for; for at the very last moment a barge load of "shakings," as staves and
                  hoops for the manufacture of casks are called, was taken on board; and other
                  remarks were made respecting the number of the crew; some said, jokingly, that the
                  captain meant to fill the casks with gold dust—and one or two knowing fellows
                  whispered that they had heard there was no insurance upon the vessel, which was
                  strange for so fine a ship; but the Albatross was soon out in the stream, and the
                  loungers and lookers-on returned home.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The reader is introduced to a New York merchant and his family. The mysterious
                     disappearance of Jane Miller.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A FEW weeks prior to the date of the occurrences recorded in the preceding
                  chapter, a large party was assembled at the splendid residence of an extensive and
                  wealthy ship-owner, situated in one of the most fashionable localities in the
                  upper portion of the city.</p>
               <p>Seated on a sofa at one end of the large apartment that was thrown open for
                  dancing, were two young ladies, daughters of the merchant, whom we will call
                  Mordant. Near them were two other ladies, one of whom had just left off playing on
                  the piano-forte, and the other was engaged in languidly turning over the leaves of
                  a Book of Beauty, which lay upon a side-table near by.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you've found time to stop jingling away at the piano, Ellen," said
                  Sarah Mordant, the elder of the sisters to her cousin, Ellen Urquhart. "Come, now,
                  give us your opinion of Captain Seymour. Isn't he handsome?"</p>
               <p>"He is a charming young man," said Ellen, "so gentlemanly, and such an elegant
                  dancer."</p>
               <p>"And what a sweet moustache, and what lovely black eyes and curly hair he has,"
                  said Adeline, the other cousin, whose interest in the Book of Beauty seemed to
                  have departed now Captain Seymour had become the theme of her cousin's and her
                  sister's conversation.</p>
               <p>"I wonder what he can see to admire so much in Jane Miller," said Mary, the
                  younger daughter of the merchant, joining in the conversation—"I wish mamma
                  wouldn't ask Jane here when Captain Seymour is coming—he directs all his attention
                  to her. It's hardly polite."</p>
               <p>"I saw him waltzing with you to-night, Mary," interposed Adeline.</p>
               <p>"Yes—just for one waltz, and then back he went to Jane and asked her hand for the
                  next dance. It is so always. I have no patience with him."</p>
               <p>"I can't think what he so admires in Jane," said Sarah Mordant; I don't think her
                  pretty."</p>
               <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7191-00000012"/>
               <p>"Pretty! no indeed," exclaimed the other ladies, in a breath, and with a toss of
                  their own beautiful heads, and Mary added—</p>
               <p>"I am sure there are many in the room whose charms quite eclipse those of Jane
                  Miller.</p>
               <p>Several gentlemen now came up and solicited the honor of being the partners of the
                  discontented belles for the next dance, and the conversation was for the time
                  suspended.</p>
               <p>While they are thus engaged we will introduce Jane Miller to the reader, and
                  explain the origin of her intimacy with the beau of the evening—the envy of his
                  own sex and the admired of the fair—the gay, handsome and gallant Captain
                  Seymour.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the remarks of the young ladies in disparagement of Jane Miller's
                  personal attractions, she was, in reality a very pretty girl, of perhaps eighteen
                  years of age. She was the daughter of a widow lady at this time on a visit to some
                  friends in New York and its vicinity; but whose abode was in one of the New
                  England States, near the sea-shore, where she owned a small farm which ensured her
                  a competence, though a very small one. Jane's father, who had been a clergyman,
                  had died when she was still a child, and the widow was left with a son and
                  daughter. The son was the younger of the two, and was, at this period, still at
                  school, studying for the naval service. Mr. Mordant, whose wife was the sister of
                  the late Mr. Miller, (hence the intimacy of the family) had promised to procure a
                  midshipman's appointment for the youth, as soon as he had completed his studies.
                  Mrs. Miller was residing at this time near Jersey City, but she with her daughter
                  had been invited to the ball.</p>
               <p>Captain Seymour was the commander of one of Mr. Mordant's vessels, and for some
                  reason unknown, was treated by the merchant on terms of equality not accorded to
                  any other captains in his employ. There were many surmises regarding the cause of
                  this favor. Some said that Captain Seymour was himself a relative of the family;
                  others, that although captain of a merchantman, he was very wealthy; again it was
                  said that he bore a commission in the navy. However, though none could correctly
                  define his position, all agreed that he was one of the most gentlemanly and most
                  elegant men they had ever known—full of wit and gaiety, and capable of rendering
                  himself agreeable to all with whom he came in contact. Consequently he was a
                  constant visitor at all the gay parties given in the neighborhood, and languishing
                  glances were cast upon him by more than one fair damsel. He danced, and flirted
                  and talked with all, but greatly to the annoyance of his fair friends, Jane
                  Miller, the humblest of all the belles he met in this gay society, seemed to be
                  his favorite. It is true that some ill-natured reports got abroad that were
                  prejudicial to the character of Seymour. It was said that he had played the gay
                  deceiver with many a trusting heart; but these reports did not injure him in the
                  estimation of his fair admirers; indeed they seemed to like him better in
                  consequence, and to dare him to the encounter with their own charms;—besides, was
                  he not the confidential friend of Mr. Mordant? and was not that a proof of his
                  respectability and integrity?</p>
               <p>Several times he had called at the residence of the window Miller in New Jersey,
                  for the express purpose of seeing Jane, and taking her out for a ride with him—and
                  both the mother and the daughter were proud of the favor he had shown them.</p>
               <p>Thus matters were progressing until about three weeks before the period at which
                  we first introduced Captain Seymour to the reader. His visits to Jane became more
                  and more frequent, and it was thought that something more than mere friendship was
                  intended by these visits. At this period, however, Jane Miller received an
                  anonymous letter written in a female hand, which read as follows:</p>
               <p>"Lady, beware of the man who calls himself Captain Seymour: he has deceived me and
                  others; he will deceive you. If you think he wishes to make you his wife, I tell
                  you he cannot and dare not. Do not disregard this warning, and you may hear from
                  me again.</p>
               <p>"One whose hopes George Seymour has blighted."</p>
               <p>Jane Miller was greatly distressed upon the receipt of this letter, for words
                  stronger than those of mere friendship had passed between her and Seymour.</p>
               <p>She resolved, after much thought and a severe mental struggle, to show Seymour the
                  letter. She would not allow her lover's fair fame to be injured and her own hopes
                  blasted by an anonymous and probably a false and malicious letter, and on their
                  next meeting she accepted his invitation to walk with him as usual, and after some
                  conversation, told him of the letter she had received, and showed it to him.</p>
               <p>He laughed at it. A mean device of some of my fair, jealous friends, your rivals
                  for my good graces Jane," said, he. "Heed them not; I like you better than they,
                  and that is the cause of their malice."</p>
               <p>Jane believed him, for her heart inclined her to listen to the<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000013"/> denial of the charges preferred against him,
                  therefore, very little protestation on his part satisfied her; (but had she been
                  less infatuated, she could but have noted the hollow, tremulous tone of voice in
                  which he spoke. Had she gazed upon his features with an earnest gaze of scrutiny,
                  at that moment she would have noticed the quiver of the muscles of his face and
                  the pallor of his complexion; but all was over in a moment, and his countenance
                  resumed its composure, his voice its assured and measured tone.)</p>
               <p>A few days after this, however, Mrs. Miller received a similar letter to that
                  which had been received by her daughter, and shortly afterwards Jane received a
                  third letter written in the same handwriting. The mother's fears were aroused, and
                  she forbade her daughter to see Seymour, and for three days Jane complied with her
                  mother's request. She herself had become alarmed, and she refused the captain's
                  visits. Still her heart refused to cast him off, without further proof than that
                  which a mere letter, the writer of which was unknown, could afford.</p>
               <p>She listened again to his importunities, and promised, unknown to her mother, who
                  was absent on a visit of a few days' duration at her New England home, to walk out
                  with him and listen to his explanations.</p>
               <p>When, a few days after, the widow returned home, her daughter was not to be found.
                  The widow was in an agony of distress. Captain Seymour was interrogated, and he
                  confessed to have walked out with her on the Jersey shore of the river, a few days
                  before, and to have escorted her back to her home, and left her at the door of her
                  mother's house.</p>
               <p>The other occupants of the house did not recollect seeing her after she left the
                  house with Capt. Seymour, but felt no alarm, as they supposed she had gone on a
                  visit to her friends in the city.</p>
               <p>Seymour appeared as much grieved and shocked as the rest of the friends who had
                  known her. Every search was made in vain; but it was discovered by the widow that
                  her daughter's jewelry had been removed, as well as a considerable portion of her
                  clothing; and, as she believed, by her daughter's hand, from the particular
                  articles that had been taken, and the care and caution with which the selection
                  had been made.</p>
               <p>The Albatross sailed about a week after this; but, during that week, Captain
                  Seymour called frequently upon the widow, and always expressed great anxiety and
                  distress respecting Jane. Captain Seymour had been gone from the port about a
                  week, when the neighborhood of Mrs. Miller's residence was alarmed by a report
                  that the body of a young woman, which had apparently been two or three weeks in
                  the water, and the features of which were so much decomposed as to prevent the
                  possibility of recognition, had been picked up by some boatmen, floating near the
                  banks of the river. Some persons who had seen the body, said that the clothing
                  (what remained of it, for it had been much torn) resembled that usually worn by
                  Jane Miller, and the unhappy widow went to see the body. She thought she
                  recognized the clothing, and also a ring on the third finger of the right hand,
                  that had been placed there by Captain Seymour in the mother's presence, at the
                  time when she thought the Captain's intentions to her daughter were dictated by
                  feelings of honor, and when she had, therefore, rather encouraged his addresses,
                  little dreaming that she would have been so soon called on to mourn over so
                  melancholy a termination of that daughter's earthly career. But who was the
                  murderer? Did her poor child die by violence or by suicide? These were the fearful
                  questions that alternately presented themselves to the widow's mind. Perhaps she
                  had, by forbidding her daughter any further intercourse with Captain Seymour, been
                  the cause of the rash act which now placed that daughter's form in its present
                  shape, before her? Again, it might be that the author of the mysterious letters
                  which she and her daughter had received, was in some way connected with the
                  murder; or perhaps, Captain Seymour was really the bad man her anonymous
                  correspondent described him to be. Each of these propositions had some weight, but
                  none of them were sufficiently proved to settle the question in her mind.</p>
               <p>A coroner's jury was summoned, and an inquest was held, and after such evidence as
                  could be brought forward was heard, the jury returned a verdict to the effect that
                  "the deceased came to her death by drowning accidentally or otherwise," and that
                  was all that was known of the matter. Mrs. Miller had the body decently interred.
                  Some time after, a gentleman residing in the neighborhood, with whom the widow was
                  partially acquainted, informed her that he had met her daughter walking out with
                  the captain, about the period of her disappearance, and that both appeared to be
                  highly excited. The captain was vehemently expostulating, and the young lady was
                  weeping. He said they were on the banks of the river when he met them, near the
                  spot where the body was found. He hinted his suspicions of Seymour; but the widow,
                  almost heartbroken<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7191-00000014"/> broken, disregarded
                  them. She, too, had her suspicions, and she had spoken to Mr. Mordant about
                  Seymour; but the merchant had given the captain so high a character, that she
                  scarcely knew what to think. She had noticed the state of excitement he had
                  appeared to be in when he called upon her, after her daughter's disappearance; but
                  this might either be the excitement of guilt or that of natural feeling and
                  anxiety. She, therefore, kept her suspicions within her own breast. Mrs. Miller
                  wore the ring as a memento of her lost child and her sad fate. She could not take
                  any measures calculated to clear up the mystery surrounding her daughter's
                  disappearance, except such as she felt would rake up sad remembrances she would
                  sooner let slumber.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Albatross sails from New York, and the secret object of her voyage becomes
                     known.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SOME days had elapsed since the departure of the Albatross. The vessel,
                  notwithstanding she had a very light cargo on board, had been so hampered, at the
                  moment of sailing, with goods that had been brought down in a hurry, and were as
                  hurriedly taken on board, that it had occupied all this interval to stow things
                  away in their places, and make everything shipshape. As long as this necessary
                  work was going on, Captain Seymour had displayed great energy, superintending the
                  arrangement of everything himself, and scarcely seeming to need rest. Fortunately,
                  the weather was fair, and the work was effected with greater rapidity than it
                  would otherwise have been, and at the expiration of the period alluded to above,
                  the Albatross wore an entirely different aspect; she had proceeded to sea more
                  lumbered up than is usual with even vessels employed in carrying emigrants or
                  troops; in fact, many persons wondered for what cause her departure had been so
                  hurried; now she presented the neat and trim appearance of a pleasure yacht, or of
                  a ship of war. The utmost cleanliness was observable everywhere, above and below,
                  and her decks were "holy stoned" to an almost chalky whiteness. Every visible
                  piece of metal was polished until it shone like burnished gold and silver, and
                  where-ever the paint on her sides or bulwarks had been chafed or smeared, in the
                  hurry and bustle of preparing for sea, the spot was carefully retouched, until not
                  a speck was to be found to mar the exquisite finish of the beautiful craft, within
                  or without. All this labor, however, had been so systematically effected, so
                  apportioned out to the crew, which was, as we have noticed, exceedingly numerous,
                  that, although all were busy, the work did not fall with excessive severity upon
                  any one, unless it were on the captain himself. The man-o'-war regulation of
                  "watch and watch" was strictly observed, and every officer and seaman had his
                  share of needful rest.</p>
               <p>Up to this period the sailors had had little time or opportunity to become
                  acquainted with each other, or to indulge in speculations relative to the voyage,
                  as is generally customary; still it was very evident that some eight or ten
                  amongst them knew more than the others, and they kept their council to themselves.
                  The crew had been divided into "messes," and to each "mess" two or more of the
                  knowing ones had been appointed, not for the purpose, <emph>as it appeared,</emph>
                  of exercising any authority over the others, still not without some obvious cause
                  for the arrangement on the part of the commander.</p>
               <p>Another regulation, seldom, however, to be met with except in national vessels,
                  but which was observed on board the Albatross, was the complete seclusion of the
                  captain from his officers. It is generally customary, however private the
                  captain's cabin may be at other times, for the first and second mates to take
                  their meals there, in company with the captain himself; not so on board the
                  Albatross. The crew were divided into three "watches," under the command,
                  severally, of the first, second, and third mates, and these officers "messed"
                  together, in a small cabin partitioned off from the after part of the steerage
                  deck on the starboard side; while a similar cabin on the larboard side,
                  immediately opposite, was appropriated to the boatswain, carpenter, sail-maker,
                  armorer, and gunner—none of whom were expected to keep watch at night, but who
                  were all required to be on duty the whole of the day—although the duties of the
                  two latter officers seemed merely nominal, and were the source of much speculation
                  and not a little merriment to many of the crew.</p>
               <p>It is necessary that we now endeavor to describe the appearance of the mates, upon
                  whom, now that the ship was made "tight and trim," appeared to be devolved by the
                  captain, her sole management.</p>
               <p>The first mate was a tall, sinewy-built, athletic Yankee—a<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000015"/> fair specimen, if one might form a judgment from
                  his appearance—of the nautical produce, in human form, of Nantucket and Martha's
                  Vineyard. His age might have been fifty, for his dark hair was slightly grizzled,
                  as were also the bushy dark whiskers, slightly tinged with red, which met beneath
                  his chin and almost concealed his sinewy throat. His face was furrowed with deep
                  marks, and the skin was tanned to a fiery bronze color, which effectually
                  resisted, now, any further action of the elements, and the large collar of his
                  coat was usually turned down over his broad shoulders, exposing his brawny chest.
                  His mouth had acquired a permanent upward twist, in consequence of his habit of
                  constantly keeping a huge plug of tobacco in his left cheek, and from the
                  opposite, downward corner of his mouth, a canal, through which the surplus tobacco
                  juice constantly flowed on to his chin, had been created by the same habit. The
                  expression of his face, though indicative of recklessness, had not, perhaps,
                  originally been unpleasant; but constant exposure from boyhood, to freezing winds
                  and scorching heats, and the presence of a suspicious cicatrized wound extending
                  from his brow across his cheek bone to the lower part of the face in front of the
                  left ear, gave him a stern, sinister aspect, that was not calculated to impress
                  the beholder favorably. The name of this worthy was Abijah Tolcroft, and he was as
                  rough and ungainly in his actions and conversation as he was in appearance,
                  although generally tolerably good-tempered after his own fashion; but there was
                  one peculiarity in Abijah—he could not endure to be questioned with regard to the
                  scar upon his face, and the unlucky querist who alluded to it in his presence, was
                  sure to arouse his ire, although sometimes, he would say to himself, casually, as
                  though in excuse for its ugliness, that it had been occasioned by his falling
                  forward upon the gunwale of a whale-boat, when he was a mere boy. So much for
                  Abijah Tolcroft, who, from his position, necessarily was a prominent personage on
                  board of the Albatross. The subordinate officers we shall describe more briefly;
                  the second mate, Edward Allan, was a short, stout young man of about twenty-eight
                  years of age; he possessed a very dark complexion, with regular and handsome
                  features, was lively in disposition and usually good tempered; but liable to
                  sudden gusts of uncontrolable passion. He hailed from Virginia, but his accent was
                  that of a foreigner, and when carried away by passion, he was wont to indulge in
                  terrific Spanish oaths. Many persons suspected, although they dared not hint it to
                  him it to him, that he was a Spanish Creole—and that, like a good many sailors, he
                  went by an adopted name. Both the above described officers had sailed several
                  voyages with captain Seymour—but the third mate, Françcois Perrin, a native of
                  Louisiana, born of French parents, and more of a Frenchman than an American in
                  manners and appearance, had been shipped in New York.</p>
               <p>François was quite a young man, apparently not more than twenty-five years of age;
                  but of immense stature, possessed of great personal strength, and morose and surly
                  in his disposition. Such as we have described were the officers of the
                  Albatross.</p>
               <p>The captain's quarters were more retired, and consisted of two small cabins, one
                  of which, the private cabin, was quite in the stern of the ship. It was a small,
                  very small place, but rendered light and airy by the two stern windows and the
                  large sky-light above; although a mere closet, it was compact and perfect in every
                  point, and furnished after a fashion that would have done credit to the most
                  refined taste ever shown in the arrangement of a lady's boudoir. A sofa of carved
                  rosewood, with crimson velvet cushions and pillows, ran the whole breadth of the
                  stern, and formed a luxurious lounge wherefrom to witness the white foam that the
                  vessel left behind as she cut her way swiftly through the yielding water, or, when
                  crossing the tropics to inhale the cool breeze and gaze down into the deep, where
                  disported the many-hued dolphin or the beautifully formed bonito, or to watch the
                  hungry yet timid and cautious shark, as surrounded by its parasites in the shape
                  of pilot fish, it now advanced towards the treacherous bait and smelt it—even
                  touching with its shovel-like snout the seemingly dainty morsel, and then turned
                  as if seized with sudden fright, and swam rapidly away, again and again to return,
                  each time grown more bold, until at last the fatal grip is made; for a moment the
                  white belly of the huge monster, as it turns upward to seize its prey, flashes
                  like a phosphorescent gleam beneath the blue water, and then a hurried flight with
                  the line, and a desperate thrashing of the water with the monster's tail, tells
                  that the terror of the ocean is captured by his inveterate foe, the sailor. The
                  rudder pipe was veneered with the finest mahogany, with gilded satin-wood
                  panels—and behind it, between the two stern windows, was a book-case reaching from
                  the sofa to the ceiling of the cabin, well stored with handsomely bound volumes,
                  chiefly consisting of poetry and works of imagination of the very highest order,
                  although the lower<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7191-00000016"/> shelf was devoted to
                  books of science and navigation and commerce, and other subjects connected with
                  the profession of the mariner.</p>
               <p>In the centre of the cabin, firmly lashed to the floor, was a handsome centre
                  table of highly polished, solid mahogany, and on each side of the cabin were two
                  recesses adapted for sleeping places, which were hidden from view by crimson silk,
                  and muslin curtains tastefully disposed; curtains of similar hue and material also
                  shaded the cabin windows. The main portion of the front of the cabin was occupied
                  by a large mirror, with a gorgeously covered and gilded frame, and in the vacant
                  places round about, hung small but exquisitely finished paintings, while from the
                  ceiling, immediately over the centre table, was suspended a handsome gilded
                  chandelier, with ground glass globes.</p>
               <p>The deck was covered with oil cloth neatly painted, and over the starboard bed
                  cabin, which was appropriated by Captain Seymour to his own use, hung a pair of
                  richly mounted pistols, and a sabre, carved after the fashion of a Turkish
                  scimitar, encased in a crimson velvet scabbard surmounted with gold, of which
                  metal the hilt appeared to be formed. The pistols and sabre, indeed, were the only
                  articles to be seen which would have led the casual observer to disincline to the
                  belief that the cabin had been purposely fitted up for the accommodation of a lady
                  of taste and fashion. From this beautiful little apartment doors on each side of
                  the mirror led into the fore-cabin used by the captain as a dining cabin and for
                  general purposes. Here the furniture, though good, was of commoner material, and
                  more appropriate to the generally conceived idea of a merchant ship's cabin. The
                  desk was covered with oil cloth, as in the after cabin; but the only light came
                  from the sky-light above, beneath which depended, directly over the dining table,
                  a thermometer and barometer. Muskets were placed in racks along the wainscot on
                  either side, and some half dozen ottomans, in lieu of chairs, were ranged around
                  the cabin; and, in a bracket over the companion way, was suspended a large ship's
                  spy glass. There was no other furniture in this cabin, except a small mahogany
                  stand screwed down in one of the aft corners, on which was firmly secured the
                  captain's chronometer. From the fore-cabin the deck was reached from a winding
                  stair-case, forming a semi-circle, around which was the steward's pantry—with a
                  sleeping place for that functionary beneath.</p>
               <p>There was, as there are in all merchant vessels, a forecastle cabin on deck,
                  filled with bunks and appropriated to the use of the sailors—but after the vessel
                  had been thoroughly set to rights, to the astonishment of the uninitiated seamen,
                  these bunks were filled up with the immediately required stores of the boatswain,
                  sailmaker and carpenter, and the men were ordered to swing their hammocks between
                  decks, man-of-war fashion—and to bring them up every morning, at the sound of the
                  boatswain's whistle, and stow them in the hammock nettings, the "watch below,"
                  during the hours of daylight, snoozing on their pea jackets, on the lower deck, or
                  amusing themselves by mending their clothing, and such other employments as
                  generally engage Jack, when at sea.</p>
               <p>Henry Davis had suffered severely from sea sickness during the first few days
                  after the vessel had left the port, and he had been treated very leniently by the
                  captain, or rather had been left pretty much to himself—Captain Seymour's time
                  having been, as we have said, fully occupied. He had been indulged with the use of
                  the larboard sleeping berth in the after cabin—where rest for a few days until he
                  had become accustomed to the motion of the vessel, restored him to his general
                  health. It was understood that he was then to occupy the post of steward, which,
                  during his temporary sickness was filled by a lad named Frank Martin, who had been
                  several voyages in others of Mr. Mordant's ships, although this was his first trip
                  in the Albatross. Frank was kind and considerate to his young shipmate,
                  notwithstanding he was compelled to fulfil his duties for him, for he had hitherto
                  been employed wholly as a cabin boy, and his ambition now prompted him to go
                  forward and rough it out with the foremast men, and to learn the duties of a
                  sailor.</p>
               <p>At length Henry recovered so far as, by the advice of the captain, to go on deck
                  and take an airing—</p>
               <p>"And go with him, Frank," added the captain, addressing the other lad—"have a chat
                  with him and tell him the name of the ropes and sails; it will cheer the poor
                  fellow's spirits up a little, I am going to read awhile in the after cabin—and
                  will ring the bell if I want your services."</p>
               <p>The two lads went on deck together, and after strolling up and down the quarter
                  deck for a few minutes, seated themselves upon the taffrail, and entered into
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>"Have you ever sailed with Captain Seymour before," asked Henry, or Harry, as he
                  was now called.</p>
               <p>"No: I have been six voyages to sea in others of Mr. Mordant's ships, but this is
                  my first trip in the Albatross."</p>
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7191-00000017"/>
               <p>"Are they all as handsome ships as this?" continued Harry. Frank laughed—</p>
               <p>"No, indeed they ain't," he answered. "For my part, I don't understand this ship
                  at all—and I don't understand Captain Seymour either. I once went on board a
                  man-of-war, when on a voyage up the Mediterranean, and they had just such rules
                  and regulations aboard as they have here; and, another thing, I can tell you, one
                  half the men don't seem to know what to make of the appearance of things. I have
                  heard them talking matters over—and I believe they would ask an explanation of the
                  captain or the officers, if it wasn't for fear of the others—those tough looking,
                  bearded fellows that the captain has placed in every one of the new fangled
                  "messes" as they are called. These chaps hang together, and I believe, though they
                  don't say so, that the other men are frightened of them."</p>
               <p>"Captain Seymour seems to be quite a gentleman," observed Harry.</p>
               <p>"A good deal too much of a gentleman for me to understand him," resumed his
                  companion; "I will tell you something strange. Do you know that since the third
                  day after leaving port we have been steering to the eastward instead of the
                  regular course of California ships?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps the captain and officers have their own reasons for so doing," replied
                  Harry.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps they have; reasons that no one else can fathom, for we are sailing close
                  to the wind, when a more southerly course would give us a leading breeze; but as
                  to the captain, I suppose he gives the mates orders how to steer; but I never
                  before saw a captain take so little heed of what was going on. He's more like a
                  passenger on board than anything else; and then, since we have got into 'blue
                  water,' he togs himself off in a navy undress and wears a cap with a gold band.
                  Seems to me that either I've got into an enchanted ship, or else into a man-o'-war
                  m disguise. I can't understand it."</p>
               <p>The bell in the captain's cabin rang, and Frank descended to learn what the
                  captain wanted.</p>
               <p>"Is Harry on deck still, Frank?" asked the captain.</p>
               <p>"Yes sir," replied the lad.</p>
               <p>"Send him down; tell him I want to speak to him, and come with him yourself."</p>
               <p>"Ay-ay, sir," responded Frank, as he left the cabin and rejoined his
                  companion.</p>
               <p>"Captain Seymour wants you, Harry," said he, "you are to go down with me into the
                  cabin."</p>
               <p>Harry rose from his seat and prepared to follow his young shipmate; his cheeks
                  flushed, and a slight tremor pervaded his limbs—the boy was naturally timid, and
                  perhaps he feared that the captain, although hitherto considerate towards him, was
                  about to find fault with him for the idle life he had led since he had come on
                  board, while every one else had been so busily employed—he followed Frank to the
                  cabin.</p>
               <p>The captain was reclining upon a sofa reading; he laid aside the book as the boys
                  entered, and thus addressed Harry—</p>
               <p>"Have you quite recovered from your sea sickness, boy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, I hope I have," answered the lad.</p>
               <p>"And you will be able to do the light duties that will in future be required of
                  you in the cabin?"</p>
               <p>"I hope so, sir. I will try my best."</p>
               <p>"Well, no one can do more. All I ask is that every one on board this ship shall
                  obey my orders implicitly and without a murmur; then you will find me a kind and
                  considerate master—otherwise, let them look out for themselves. They had better
                  wish themselves in h—I than on board the Albatross."</p>
               <p>A stern expression, such as neither of the lads had seen before, came over the
                  handsome features of the captain, as he gave vent to this last expression—but it
                  immediately vanished. It made apparently but little impression upon Frank, but
                  Harry trembled to such a degree that he was scarcely able to reply that he hoped
                  he should be able to please him.</p>
               <p>"Don't be frightened boy," said the captain, smiling. "I have no doubt you and I
                  shall agree very well together. Consider yourself from this moment installed into
                  the duties of my steward. You, Frank, Mr. Mordant informed me, are anxious to
                  learn a seaman's duties, so I suppose you will be glad to relinquish your post to
                  your successor. Well, you are in the right, boy—I will tell Mr. Tolcroft to
                  appoint you to one of the messes, and I hope I shall hear a good account of you.
                  You can both go now"—and taking up his book again, the captain was soon apparently
                  deeply absorbed in its contents.</p>
               <p>"Captain Seymour has more spirit than I gave him credit for, in spite of his dandy
                  dress and his white hands," whispered Frank to his companion.</p>
               <p>"The expression of his face was terrible," answered Harry—still trembling. "I
                  never could have believed such a change could have come over any one's features in
                  a moment, least of all—so handsome a face as that of Captain Seymour—<pb n="32-33"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000018"/> I am half sorry I shipped with him," and a deep but
                  expressive sigh escaped from the breast of the boy as he spoke.</p>
               <p>Frank laughed—"You will soon find out that a handsome face often conceals a d—I's
                  heart," he replied. "You are like a young bear, all your sorrows have yet to
                  come."</p>
               <p>We have never been able to understand to what particular sorrows a bear is
                  subjected, beyond those natural to all quadrupeds, or bipeds, too, for that
                  matter; but it has been, for time immemorial, a common expression amongst seamen;
                  is, by them, we presume, considered as remarkably witty, and therefore Frank is
                  held excusable in our opinion for delivering himself of it.</p>
               <p>Harry Davis took charge of the steward's pantry, and Frank Martin went on deck
                  again to commence his new duties.</p>
               <p>While this conversation had been going on in the cabin and on the quarter deck—a
                  group of seamen, tempted by the fineness of the evening, instead of returning to
                  their hammocks, when the "watch" was "piped below" had seated themselves in the
                  head of the vessel, and were amusing themselves with their pipes and cozy
                  chat.</p>
               <p>"Tell ye what it is, Bill," said one, as after knocking the ashes out of his pipe,
                  he had temporarily laid it aside. "Tell ye what it is—there ain't none o' them
                  black a vized chaps within ear hail, be there?"—added the man, stopping suddenly,
                  and looking cautiously around him.</p>
               <p>"No—by luck's chance there ain't, Dick—what then?"</p>
               <p>"Have ye got any bacca?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Then give us a chaw—and, shipmates, I'll tell ye a bit of my mind."</p>
               <p>The quid was supplied, and Dick forthwith deposited it in his cheek, and giving it
                  two or three rolls over with his tongue, so as to draw out the flavor—thus
                  proceeded.</p>
               <p>"Shipmates, there's somethin' or other as I can't understand as regards the
                  regulations o' this here craft; blowed if it don't conflisticate me entirely. I've
                  sailed in many a craft in my days. I've sailed aboard 'Uncle Sam,' and I've sailed
                  in merchantmen of every sort; but I never seed sich rummy moves as goes on board
                  this here hooker; d—me if she ain't like a craft as has been metarmorfussed—she's
                  got man-o'-war rules without man-o'-war guns. Then there's the skipper saunterin'
                  about, dressed as fine as a leeftenant, afore he's got used to the swabs upon his
                  shoulders, or a post-captain for the matter of that, while the first mate's as
                  rough and ready a chap as ye'd find aboard a Nantucket whaler; t'other mates they
                  never hardly speaks to the crew, except it be them black a vized chaps, they're
                  stuck into every mess—and they seems jist as distant with the captain. Now,
                  shipmates, I've got something else to say, I don't pretend to be any thing of a
                  schollard, seeing as how I never had more nor a quarter's schoolin' in my life;
                  but a fellow as has been upon the salt water, man and boy, a matter of twenty
                  years or more, doesn't want much book-larnin' to know as a East South East course
                  ain't the nearest way to steer to reach the 'Quator, and a barky must cross the
                  'Quator, at least, about amidships between the African and American shores to get
                  to Californy. It's my opinion as the skipper ain't bound to Californy at all.
                  Then, shipmates, who on 'arth ever see a crew of well on to thirty hands, besides
                  officers, in a small vessel such as this craft is? b'lieve me, all ain't right
                  aboard, and its our dooty to know where we are going to, and what sort of a craft
                  we've got aboard of," then lowering his voice to a whisper, Dick added,
                  "shipmates, its my private opinion as this 'ere blessed craft is either a slaver
                  or somethin' worse."</p>
               <p>"But she ain't got no guns aboard," replied one of the listeners.</p>
               <p>"Not so far as we knows," replied Dick, "but who among us knows what is aboard and
                  what ain't; she's got an armorer and a gunner—at any rate,—and I guess guns 'll be
                  found when they are wanted."</p>
               <p>"The skipper don't look much like a slaver captain," observed one of the
                  group—"He's too soft spoken, and too dandified."</p>
               <p>"If you'd had the trick at the helm, night afore last, Tom," replied Dick, "you
                  wouldn't ha' said that. He and the first mate were a talking earnestly together,
                  and the mate, he said somethin' that the skipper didn't seem to like, and blow me,
                  if I don't think it was relating to the crew—however, whatever it was, the skipper
                  looked as savage as ever I seed a man look in my life, and he turned on his heel,
                  and says he:</p>
               <p>"'We'll see when the proper time comes, Mr. Tolcroft; I never found the man yet
                  who dare oppose my will,' and away he walked, puffing the smoke from his cigar
                  like a high pressure <emph>ingine,</emph> as he strode half a dozen times up and
                  down the quarter deck, and then he dived into the cabin, and I seed no more on him
                  during that watch."</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7191-00000019"/>
               <p>"What had best be done, shipmates?" asked one of the group, after they had sat
                  silent for some moments.</p>
               <p>"Why," answered Dick, who appeared to have taken upon himself the office of
                  spokesman for the party; "what I recommends is this; there's on'y ten of them
                  black-a-vised chaps—and there's twenty of us—I b'lieve them to be in the skipper's
                  and mate's secret and we ain't; they may look fiercer with their mustachers and
                  black whiskers and beards; but they ain't no stronger nor no braver men than we
                  be. I proposes, as we makes up our minds to send a 'round robin' to the skipper,
                  respectfully axin' to know what sort of a v'yage we've shipped for. If he tells
                  us, so, well; if not; we must think o' somethin' else—but I goes dead ag'in
                  sailing in the dark."</p>
               <p>One of the men alluded to under the name of "black-a-vised chaps" now carelessly
                  joined the group, and the party shortly broke up and went below to their
                  hammocks.</p>
               <p>A fortnight passed, and it appeared that nothing had been determined upon by the
                  malcontents, since no "round robin" had been sent to the captain. A greater
                  distance than ever appeared to be observed by one portion of the crew with regard
                  to the other, and the symptoms of discontent were noticed by the captain and the
                  mates, but no movement towards an explanation was made.</p>
               <p>During this period, the wind had come round farther to the westward; the ship's
                  yards had been squared, and she had made extraordinary progress towards her
                  destination, wherever that might be. The wind had increased to gale but the ship
                  sped gallantly on before it, and made excellent weather, bounding over the billows
                  like a duck, without throwing a drop of spray on her decks. The captain, whose
                  listless habits had attracted the notice of the crew, now appeared oftener upon
                  deck, and sometimes, especially towards nightfall, he carefully scanned the
                  horizon with his spy-glass. Once or twice he remained on deck throughout the whole
                  night, merely taking an occasional nap on the hen-coop, wrapped up in his boat
                  cloak. One of the crew always chosen—although as if by a mere chance order—from
                  the ten men already alluded to, was constantly stationed at the topmast head, on
                  the look-out, and one morning the well known but always startling cry of "sail
                  ho!" was heard.</p>
               <p>The captain, who had gone down into the cabin to breakfast, was on deck, spy-glass
                  in hand, in a moment.</p>
               <p>"Where away?" he shouted to the look-out.</p>
               <p>"On the weather bow, sir?" was the reply.</p>
               <p>"What does she look like?"</p>
               <p>"I can't make out yet. I can but just see her topsails—the canvas looks white and
                  square. She may be a cruiser."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Tolcroft," said the captain, "we are out of the range of any regular traders;
                  that vessel must either be the craft I am looking out for, or one of the infernal
                  British cruisers. Any way, we had better get the weather gage of her. Brace
                  for'ard the yards, men," he shouted to the crew, for the first time since the
                  vessel had sailed from New York, taking the direction of the vessel into his own
                  hands.</p>
               <p>The yards were promptly braced almost sharp up, the vessel careened over to the
                  pressure of the wind, now brought abeam, and the captain again shouted to the
                  look-out aloft—"How does the strange sail bear now?"</p>
               <p>"On the lee beam," replied the man.</p>
               <p>"Can you see anything more of her?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir; her topsails only are yet in sight."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Tolcroft," said the captain, "we will keep her on this course for a couple of
                  hours until we have worked well to windward, before we approach her any nearer. We
                  can then do as we please, after obtaining a closer view." Then again addressing
                  the look-out, he shouted, "let me know if the strange sail alters her course, and
                  also as soon as you can distinguish her courses. Mr. Tolcroft," he added, "it
                  would be as well now to get up the guns; not however, that they will be needed,
                  because, if the stranger should turn out to be a cruiser, I mean to show her our
                  heels, and I should like to see one of the vermin that could touch the Albatross
                  in a breeze like this, and if she proves to be the vessel I expect, why her
                  captain and I will shake flippers together instead of fighting."</p>
               <p>"Would it not be better, Captain Seymour, to speak to the men now, afore I gives
                  the order? The time must come. Seems to me there's no time like the present," was
                  the mate's reply.</p>
               <p>"Ah, well thought of, Mr. Tolcroft, Call Allan and François aft, and then direct
                  the boatswain to pipe all hands."</p>
               <p>Thus saying, the captain descended to his cabin and armed himself with the pistols
                  described as hanging above his sleeping berth. Carefully concealing the weapons in
                  his bosom, he re-ascended just as the men, some of them still half asleep, there
                  emerging from the hatchways. Allan and Francois were standing conversing with the
                  first mate.</p>
               <p>"By gar!" said the latter, in reply to some remark of the<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000020"/> first mate's, just as the captain approached, and
                  loud enough for him to hear—"By gar! I would make short vork of it; they should
                  not dare to say dere soul vas dere own. Join us or walk de plank—"</p>
               <p>"Silence, Francois," interrupted the captain, in an authoritative tone. "Allan
                  once got me into a scrape through such brutality as you seem inclined to. Moral
                  suasion is the thing. There are few cases in which a spoonful of oil will not go
                  further than a quart of vinegar."</p>
               <p>By this time the men were assembled, wondering, the greater part of them, for what
                  purpose they had been summoned, yet partly guessing the cause.</p>
               <p>"My lads," said the captain, stepping forward, "I wish to know from your own lips,
                  whether or not you have found yourselves well treated since you have been under my
                  command?"</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay, sir," was the universal reply. None of the men could have responded
                  otherwise to this question.</p>
               <p>"Well then," continued the captain, "I shall say but a few words in explanation. I
                  dare say many of you, believing that you had shipped on board a merchant vessel
                  bound to California, have wondered not only at the regulations of my ship, but
                  also at the course I have thought proper to steer. I am glad, however, to find
                  that none amongst you have thought it necessary to remonstrate. Had such been the
                  case, it might have led to something <emph>unpleasant</emph> (laying a stress on
                  the word). I am not in the habit of having my slightest word disobeyed, nor even
                  disputed. My lads, we are bound not to California, but to the coast of Africa—not
                  after gold, but after what will put gold into our pockets, faster than it can be
                  found by the luckiest adventurer in California. The Albatross is bound to the
                  Coast for the slaves, which we shall dispose of in Havana or in the Brazils. There
                  are some amongst you who have all along known this. I have not thought it
                  necessary to inform the others until now. I wished first to see what you were made
                  of. As seamen, I acknowledge I am proud of you. Your conduct hitherto proves to me
                  that I can trust you. I am expecting hereabouts to meet with a consort, who will
                  give me perhaps, some valuable information respecting the state of affairs upon
                  the Coast at present. There is a vessel now in sight which may be the one of which
                  I am in search, or it may be a Britisher. I do not intend to approach much nearer
                  till I am satisfied which it be. Mr. Tolcroft is now about to rouse up the guns
                  which have hitherto been concealed in the lower hold. I have heard some of you
                  joking at the idea of my having a gunner and armorer on board. Well, lads, I have
                  no objections now and then to a harmless joke; but you will see that henceforward
                  the gunner and armorer will find employment for themselves.</p>
               <p>"Now, men, give one cheer to show that you are all satisfied, and then to work
                  with a will, and bowse up the guns from below."</p>
               <p>The men, not in the secret, had listened with amazement; but the confident manner
                  and tone of the captain had pleased them, and certain remarks he had made had
                  shown them, intuitively, that he was not a man to be trifled with. We have
                  observed in a preceding chapter, that the seamen had all been picked out by the
                  captain, on account of their appearance, and his belief that they were such as
                  would suit his purpose, though he had confided his secret but to a few, chosen on
                  account of the especial truculency of their appearance, and the recommendation of
                  the shipping master, who knew them. The novelty of the idea pleased the
                  rest—sailors like novelty; besides they saw at a glance they could not help
                  themselves, and visions of gain floated before their eyes in the distance. One
                  loud, unanimous shout was the response.</p>
               <p>"We will stick to you, captain, to the last," and under the direction of the
                  mates, they proceed to put the vessel into warlike trim.</p>
               <p>Harry Davis had heard the speech. He was standing by Frank, who whispered—</p>
               <p>"I guessed this, from the first. I don't care; but what would my mother say, if
                  she knew I was on board a slaver."</p>
               <p>"Good God!" was the reply of Harry. "Is it possible! Captain Seymour the commander
                  of a slave ship. Can Mr. Mordant be aware of this?"</p>
               <p>"Francois," said Captain Seymour, as, his harangue concluded, he left the mates
                  and crew to the execution of the orders he had given, and returned to the use of
                  his spy-glass, as if he felt satisfied that he had done and said enough.
                  "François, let this be a lesson to you. I see you are inclined to be impetuous; in
                  nine cases out of ten, impetuosity is not only needless, but positively injurious.
                  Men are to be governed by firmness and suavity mingled. When, as I grant sometimes
                  you may, you meet with doltheads too stupid to listen to reason and unable to
                  understand moral suasion, then hit right and left; kill and slay without
                  compunction; but such things should be avoided if possible. Just take a look
                  through your glass,<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7191-00000021"/> Mr. Allan," added he,
                  addressing the second mate. "I fancy I can discover the strange ship's top-g'ant
                  sails."</p>
               <p>The second mate did as he was requested, and leaving Captain Seymour and his crew
                  keeping a sharp lookout after the stranger, we will close the present chapter, and
                  beg the reader to return with us to the residence of the owner of the Albatross in
                  New York city.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Showing how the slave trade is maintained, and exposing the heartlessness
                     engendered by fashion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ON the very day week after the Albatross had sailed on her voyage, Mr. Mordant on
                  returning home from his office in the lower part of the city had taken his dinner
                  as usual with his family, and then something contrary to his usual custom, had
                  left the ladies in the park, and retired to his study, taking with him a roll of
                  documents, which he sat himself down to read carefully. There did not appear,
                  however, to be anything disagreeable in the nature of these documents; for Mr.
                  Mordant, on offering his study, before he sat down, had lit the globe lamp that
                  stood upon the centre table; then unlocked the door of a small buffet beneath a
                  bookcase and taking therefrom a decanter of Port and a wine-glass (Mr. Mordant was
                  a lover during the evening), he placed it on the table, with a wine glass, then
                  took off his coat, and taking a voluminous dressing-grown from a peg, he hung up
                  the coat, and wrapped the gown around him: this done, he poured out a glass of
                  wine, drank it off, smacked his lips, and with a smile upon his rather handsome,
                  threw himself lazily down into the chair.</p>
               <p>A negro servant answered the summons.</p>
               <p>"Ned," said the merchant, "bring up my slippers, and the coalscuttle."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied the man, and leaving the room, he returned in a few minutes
                  with the articles his master had called for.</p>
               <p>"Put some coals on the fire, Ned; and, Ned, I expect a gentleman to call upon me
                  this evening. When he comes, show him up stairs."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," again replied the servant, and Mr. Mordant was left to the perusal of
                  his papers and the enjoyment of his wine. He took things very leisurely; taking in
                  one hand his gold double eye-glass, he separated the glasses by touching the
                  spring, and applying them to his optics, slowly perused paper after paper.</p>
               <p>An exclamation of satisfaction, something between a sigh and a grunt, proceeded
                  from his lips as he laid aside the last of the documents, and then, after drinking
                  a second glass of wine, he muttered to himself as he sat turning the glasses in
                  his fingers, and gazing at the flickering flames in the cannel coal fire.</p>
               <p>"Altogether a very well managed piece of business—very—good—indeed (these last
                  words were uttered slowly), shall make a capital thing of it, if Seymour only is
                  as lucky this trip as he was on the last. He may lose the Albatross during her
                  next voyage in that case. One voyage has cleared her cost and all the expenses,
                  not only of that, but of the present one Cautious, and a devilish clever fellow is
                  Seymour, and such a gentlemanly dog withal; brave as a lion, too; perhaps a
                  little—just a <emph>leetle</emph> wild, but merely the hot blood of youth; it must
                  sow its wild oats. I wonder what keeps Grindley; it's past the hour on which he
                  promised to call."</p>
               <p>There was a ring at the bell at the hall door, and in a few moments the sound of
                  footsteps was heard ascending the stairs, and there was a rap at the door of the
                  study.</p>
               <p>"Come in," said the merchant—the negro servant entered and announced "Mr.
                  Douglass."</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant never swore in the full acceptation of the term—never even made use of
                  an ill-sounding word excepting when by himself, and then only when unusually
                  elated or depressed; but a naughty word almost escaped from his lips when the
                  announcement was made by the servant man. (He was almost excusable under the
                  circumstances—he had been on the tether hooks of expectation, awaiting the arrival
                  of Mr. Grindley, and Mr. Douglass was unexpectedly announced.) However, by a
                  strong effort he suppressed the wicked exclamation, and welcomed his visitor with
                  a smile.</p>
               <p>"I am happy to gee you, Mr. Douglass," said he, rising from his seat, and taking
                  his unlooked-for visitor by the hand. "Pray be seated. Ned"—turning to the
                  servant—"place a<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7191-00000022"/> wine glass on the table
                  for Mr. Douglass. Take a glass of wine, Mr. Douglass—such port as you don't often
                  find, sir—my own importation, vintage 1814.</p>
               <p>Mr. Douglass poured out a glass of wine and drank it, and took the proffered
                  chair. "I have called, knowing your benevolence, Mr. Mordant," said he, "on an
                  errand of charity. Some friends of mine, and yours too, who take a great interest
                  in African emancipation, are stirring themselves to raise a fund to enable a free
                  negro in this city to purchase his wife and children from their owner in
                  Louisiana. The price demanded is $1,100, and we have already raised $700. What sum
                  shall I put down opposite your name, Mr. Mordant?"</p>
               <p>"You may put me down for fifty dollars, Mr. Douglass. I am always glad to give my
                  mite in the cause of charity."</p>
               <p>"Very handsome, indeed, Mr. Mordant—very handsome; besides, sir, it is not only
                  your donation, liberal as it is, which pleases me; but I consider the example set
                  to other wealthy men. Your subscription will bring others, and amongst us, we
                  shall have the pleasure of serving our fellow creatures, the poor benighted
                  children of Africa."</p>
               <p>"I am thankful that I am in a situation to render such assistance," replied the
                  merchant, who was evidently impatient for his visitor to take his departure.
                  Perhaps Mr. Douglass noticed this, for after sitting a few moments, he said—</p>
               <p>"I see you are engaged, Mr. Mordant. I will not longer intrude upon your time. I
                  am confident that a gentleman so extensively engaged in business as you are, must
                  have all his time fully employed."</p>
               <p>"I am rather busy to-night, Mr. Douglass," said Mr. Mordant, glancing at the
                  papers on the table; "but I shall be happy to see you at any time. Drop in, in a
                  friendly manner, whenever you may chance to be passing this way." Then shaking his
                  visitor by the hand, he bade him "good-night," and Mr. Douglass left the room, and
                  was shown out by the servant man. "A very obtrusive man, that Douglass," muttered
                  the merchant after he had heard the servant close the street door. "There are
                  fifty dollars thrown away. Not that I care for the money, thank heaven! I can
                  afford that; and after all, these things do no harm; they help people on in the
                  world, and raise them wonderfully in the estimation of their friends, and then
                  when one comes to think of it, there is charity, real charity, in such donations
                  as these. Here is a poor man whose family are separated from him, and held in
                  slavery—a few wealthy persons interest themselves, and his wife and children are
                  set at liberty, and he is rendered happy. Now (again glancing at the papers on the
                  table) here the case is altogether different. They <emph>will</emph> purchase
                  slaves in Cuba and in the Brazils, and somebody or other <emph>will</emph> bring
                  them from Africa to sell. I fit out a ship for this purpose; take care that
                  everything on board is adapted for the comfort of the poor wretches on the
                  voyage—and I dispose of them at a great profit to myself, and to all who are
                  engaged in the undertaking with me. Very probably I am sowing the seeds of their
                  addition, or at least the adoption of their offspring into the Christian Church,
                  and fitting them for future emancipation. At all events, Seymour assures me they
                  are slaves to greater tyrants in their own country than they are in Cuba or
                  anywhere else—and, therefore, under any circumstances, I am doing them a service.
                  Then, it may be said, I am evading the laws of my country. So does everybody who
                  fetches a piece of silk or a bundle of lace over the water. Such offences are
                  merely venial. The guilt only lies in their discovery, and that I have taken every
                  precaution against."</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant was interrupted in his speciously argumentative soliloquy by a second
                  ring at the door-bell, and in a few seconds more Mr. Grindley was shown into the
                  study.</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Mr. Grindley," said the merchant, rising from his seat, and
                  cordially shaking the hand of his visitor. "I have been expecting you for some
                  time; I wish you to go over these writings with me to-night, to see that they are
                  all correct, in order that you may make no mistake in the entries at the Custom
                  House. You are sure these are duplicates?"</p>
               <p>"I copied them myself, Mr. Mordant, and will take my oath of their
                  correctness."</p>
               <p>"I am satisfied, Mr. Grindley, and your services shall be well rewarded. There
                  were no suspicions about the non-insurance?"</p>
               <p>"The matter was spoken of," replied Grindley, who as the reader will perceive was
                  a clever and cunning, though pliant tool in the merchant's hands—and who was
                  generally supposed to be merely a clerk in Mr. Mordant's employ. "The matter was
                  spoken of, but I effectually silenced any unpleasant remarks that might have been
                  made, by observing that you had so much merchandise embarked—in so many and such
                  varied channels—that you found it cheaper to risk an occasional loss than to pay
                  the immense sum that the insurance companies would annually draw from you."</p>
               <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7191-00000023"/>
               <p>"Quite right, Mr. Grindley, quite right; but how will that apply with regard to
                  the Stormy Petrel, which will sail for Calcutta on the first of next month. She
                     <emph>must</emph> be insured, you know."</p>
               <p>"Oh, we must make her an especial case. Such a valuable cargo on board, you see;
                  insured by other merchants in different offices, and so much of your own
                  merchandise on board besides, that in this case you think it really advisable to
                  insure."</p>
               <p>"You are a sharp fellow, Grindley," said the merchant, laughing. "Let me see—I
                  promised you $1000 if the Albatross came cleverly through her former voyage, and
                  $1000 more if you succeeded in getting her clear off to sea on the present
                  occasion. In both cases you have succeeded admirably. Here is a check for the
                  amount, I brought it with me from town to-day" (handing Grindley a paper).</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir," replied Grindley, "you will always find me ready and I trust
                  able to serve you."</p>
               <p>"Help yourself to some wine, Grindley," said the merchant.</p>
               <p>"By the by," said Grindley, after helping himself to a glass of wine; "did you
                  hear of the discovery of the body of a female found floating in the river, near
                  Hoboken, yesterday?"</p>
               <p>"I saw a paragraph to that effect in the morning papers, but these things are of
                  such common occurrence, I took no heed of it"—answered the merchant.</p>
               <p>"The body appeared as though it had been about a fortnight in the water,"
                  continued Grindley; "it was a silly thing in me, perhaps! but I couldn't help
                  thinking it might have been the body of the young lady, Miss Miller—who has been
                  unaccountably absent from her home about that time."</p>
               <p>"Oh no—impossible! impossible," exclaimed Mr. Mordant. "Miss Miller is distantly
                  related to our family. I would not have such a report get abroad for anything, Mr.
                  Grindley."</p>
               <p>"Then of course, sir, it shall go no further—but pardon me. Have you any idea
                  whether Captain Seymour knew anything of Miss Miller's abduction, or elopement, or
                  disappearance in some way or other? They were said to have been very intimate, and
                  he was in her company—near the spot where this body was found—not many days before
                  she was missing."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Grindley," said the merchant, "the subject of Miss Miller's disappearance is
                  a painful one to me. I beg that you will not again allude to it in my presence,
                  nor say anything to any one about the inquest held on the unfortunate female's
                  body yesterday, in connection with Miss Miller's name. Rest assured, however, that
                  Captain Seymour knew nothing of Miss Miller, further than as a friend whom he met
                  at my house, and to whom he paid the compliment of two or three calls at the house
                  of her mother."</p>
               <p>"I am aware," answered Grindley, "that the subject must be a painful one. It was
                  mere thoughtlessness on my part that induced me to mention the matter. Of course,
                  at your request, I shall be silent upon it in future."</p>
               <p>"You will find your account in following my wishes, in that regard, Mr. Grindley,"
                  returned the merchant, "and now I will wish you good night. Mrs. Mordant and my
                  daughters will be getting anxious for my appearance in the parlor."</p>
               <p>"Goodnight, sir, and success to the second trip of the Albatross, and to her
                  gallant commander, Captain Seymour," replied Grindley.</p>
               <p>"I thank you, Mr. Grindley," answered the merchant, as his visitor descended the
                  stairs. Mr. Mordant sat for some time, silently and thoughtfully gazing upon the
                  fire. There was a gloom upon his brow, which but little comported with his late
                  hilarity. At length he rose, looked most timidly around him, and shuddered
                  slightly, as exclaiming—</p>
               <p>"No, no—that could not be—I will not believe it," he descended the stairs himself,
                  and joined the party in the parlor.</p>
               <p>It comprised on this evening only his own family, consisting of his wife, the two
                  daughters already introduced to the reader, and his son Charles, a young man of
                  about twenty-five years of age, who was nominally studying for the bar, in Boston,
                  but who had, for a month or two past, been on a visit to his father and
                  mother.</p>
               <p>This youth was living a gay life upon the liberal allowance he received from his
                  father, and the credit he could readily obtain on the security of his future
                  expectations. Charles Mordant rather liked to be thought what is vulgarly called a
                  "fast man," and, therefore, he spent more money than was convenient to himself,
                  and indulged in vices and debaucheries that were injurious to his health, not so
                  much because he took pleasure in them as to distinguish himself from "slow men,"
                  whom he, in common with his companions, held in scorn and contempt.</p>
               <p>He had visited his family with the object of persuading his mother to induce his
                  father to foot some pretty heavy bills he had incurred in Boston, and on this
                  evening he had succeeded<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7191-00000024"/> in obtaining her
                  promise to enlist herself on his side. The old lady doted on her son, and he had
                  persuaded her that his allowance was quite inadequate to his position in life.</p>
               <p>His private <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tête-à-tête</foreign> with his mother had been
                  interrupted by his father's entrance. A short silence ensued, and then Sarah, the
                  eldest sister, by way of starting a new subject of conversation, alluded to the
                  mention in the morning papers of the discovery of the drowned body of a female in
                  the river between Jersey City and Hoboken.</p>
               <p>"Did you see the report in the paper, Charles?" she asked of her brother.</p>
               <p>A slight shudder passed over the frame of the young man, and his face turned pale,
                  as he replied:—</p>
               <p>"I glanced at the paragraph; but I never read such things—they depress my spirits
                  and make me nervous."</p>
               <p>"Why, Charles," retorted his sister, "one would think the ghost of the woman had
                  passed before your mental vision. My brother Charles frightened by a newspaper
                  paragraph! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>
               <p>"What a very shocking thing it is when viewed in connection with the singular
                  disappearance of Jane Miller," said Mary Mordant, taking up the subject of
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>"Very shocking, indeed; if the body found in the river was really hers," said
                  Charles, speaking in a tone of forced calmness: "but such things happen every
                  day."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but not in <emph>our</emph> circle," interrupted the eldest sister. "It's so
                  much more dreadful when these things occur in <emph>our</emph> set."</p>
               <p>"Jane Miller was hardly entitled to that distinction," said Mary. "You know the
                  Millers are so <emph>dreadfully</emph> poor."</p>
               <p>"But, unfortunately, Mrs. Miller happens to be one of those terrible bores called
                  'poor relations,' whom one can never get rid of," replied Sarah Mordant.</p>
               <p>"I do desire that the unfortunate occurrence may never be alluded to in my
                  presence," suddenly interposed Mr. Mordant, who had apparently, for some minutes
                  past, with difficulty restrained himself from interrupting the conversation. "Jane
                  Miller has disgraced herself—let us forget her, otherwise we may share in the
                  disgrace."</p>
               <p>"By all means, my dear papa," exclaimed Sarah. "I assure you I never had any great
                  store of love for Jane Miller—the forward, conceited thing! She—so poor as she
                  was, to think herself pretty! and give herself such airs in company."</p>
               <p>"And then, how dowdily she always dressed," said Mary; "I'm sure the silk dress
                  she used to wear at our parties, to which ma <emph>would</emph> invite her, was
                  quite shabby. I was really ashamed to acknowledge her; and—that reminds me, pa,"
                  she continued, running to the old gentleman and kissing him, "that you promised to
                  buy me a mantilla as soon as the latest fashion from Paris came out at Madame De
                  La Tour's. They came out yesterday. Now, pa, you must keep your promise—musn't he,
                  Sarah?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure, and so he will," said Sarah, in her turn drawing near to her father,
                  throwing her arms around his neck, and kissing his forehead.</p>
               <p>"You are a couple of coaxing minxes," said the merchant, gently disengaging
                  himself from his daughters' embrace; "but your old father will be as good as his
                  word, only let me never hear Jane Miller's name mentioned by either of you."</p>
               <p>So saying, he placed a roll of bills in the hands of his eldest daughter, adding,

               <p>The two girls skipped playfully away from his side, and resumed the seats they had

               <p>Charles looked wistfully at the bills; but, at a sign from his mother, he thought
                  it advisable to keep silent on the subject of money until she had prepared the way
                  with his father, and the remainder of the evening was spent in general
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>Some few weeks after this, the merchant received a letter from a correspondent on

               </argument>
               <p>IN a neat little cottage on the coast of Maine, near Camden, Penobscot Bay, there
                  resided, some few years prior to the date of the commencement of our story, a
                  widow lady named Martin. Her husband had been an officer in the United States
                  army; but, for many years before his death, he had retired from the service, in
                  consequence of ill health and infirmity superinduced<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000025"/> by the fatigues he had gone through during the
                  campaign of 1812-14 in the course of which he had been twice severely wounded. At
                  the close of the war he had retired to a small property in the locality we have
                  mentioned, which he had in-herited from his father. Here his health had rapidly
                  improved, and although already past the middle age, he had, to the surprise of
                  every one, for he was considered to be a confirmed old bachelor, taken unto
                  himself a wife, several years younger than her husband, who bore him three
                  children, William and Frank and Sarah, the second of whom has already been
                  introduced to the reader on board the Albatross.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Martin, however, did not live long after the birth of his daughter, and
                  at the period of his death, the eldest boy, William, had but just attained his
                  tenth year.</p>
               <p>Frank was three years younger, and little Sarah was only two years of age.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martin was left by her husband in rather straitened circumstances, although
                  in the distant part of the country where she resided and where living was much
                  more moderate than in the cities, she had sufficient, with the practice of
                  economy, to support her family in comfort.</p>
               <p>It was a wild romantic spot where the cottage was situated, overlooking as it did,
                  the rude, and stormy bay. Yet it was not devoid of natural beauties. In summer it
                  would have been considered a pleasant spot by the tourist, if ever any summer
                  tourist had thought of venturing so far in search of health or pleasure—for the
                  cottage stood in an ornamental enclosure, plentifully supplied with evergreens and
                  such hardy shrubs and trees as would withstand the rigors and exposures of the
                  winters of that latitude, while the wide parterres of flowers, which bloomed and
                  blossomed in profusion, enchanted the eye with their gorgeous colors and loaded
                  the surrounding atmosphere with their perfume—the smooth green-sward in front of
                  the house—the neat gravel walks edged with box bush—the pretty secluded cottage
                  almost hidden amidst the woodbine and sweetbriar bushes, which clambered over the
                  walls and roof, and clustered around the windows, showed a marked and agreeable
                  contrast with the dark rugged cliffs which formed the background of the landscape,
                  for the cottage stood in a dell or ravine, apparently created by some sudden
                  convulsion of nature at a remote period, which seemed to have severed the huge
                  cliff that towered above and around, and opened an agreeable valley, in which the
                  verdure that was denied to the surrounding ing exposed lands, grew and flourished
                  in perfection, all the more grateful to the eye, in consequence of the barren,
                  bleak aspect of the mountain scenery. On both sides and in the rear the cottage
                  was sheltered from the winds by tall over-hanging cliffs, which, in summer time
                  were clothed in a scanty garb of brownish moss of a neutral tint, which well set
                  off, in a sort of frame-work, the fresh verdure of the valley. In front were the
                  waters of the bay, above which the cottage stood at an elevation of some three
                  hundred feet; this in summer was an additional attraction, but in winter it looked
                  bleak and cheerless—although a jut of land stretching for a mile into the bay on
                  the southern side of the valley, protected it in a great measure, from the rude
                  breezes of the open ocean. A winding descent led from the eminence on which the
                  cottage was located to the sea beach, which formed a narrow rim at the foot of the
                  cliff, the sea, at high water rushing up to its base, in which it had worked
                  several dark, gloomy caverns, wherein numerous sea birds had taken up their
                  abode.</p>
               <p>Such was the appearance of the home of Frank Martin, and it is not be wondered at,
                  that with these associations around them from their earliest childhood, the two
                  sons of the widow should, at an early period, have shown a strong predilection for
                  a sea life. Their hours of leisure were spent in playing upon the sea-shore,
                  sailing mimic ships in the pools left on the beach by the receding waves—paddling
                  amongst the slimy rocks, and gathering seaweed—or scaling the cliffs and
                  penetrating into the dark, gloomy caverns in search of the eggs of sea-birds; and
                  from the period they first began to lisp, they expressed a wish to become sailors.
                  Until the death of Lieutenant Martin, the boys being mere children, these
                  expressions were laughed at by their parents, but when the widow was left the sole
                  protector of her family, she sought, by every means in her power, to disuade her
                  children from thinking of a sea life, and endeavored to turn their inclinations
                  into some other channel. With William she succeeded. He was of a more sober,
                  sedate disposition than his younger brother, generally not so much liked by his
                  boyish companions, for he was fond of making shrewd bargains with them, and always
                  managing to gain the upper hand; but he was a much greater favorite with the
                  schoolmaster at Camden, who praised him highly for his diligent attention to his
                  studies, and his serious behavior in school hours, while Frank was a young
                  scapegrace, generally at the bottom of his class, except when he chose to exert
                     himself<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7191-00000026"/> self to learn some favorite
                  lesson, when his natural aptitude enabled him to master it in advance of most of
                  his class-fellows. Frank was, however, the idol of his school-fellows and
                  playmates, and if the widow entertained any partiality towards either of her sons,
                  it was towards her second son, Frank, although she always said, and always tried
                  to persuade herself, that her sedate son William was the better behaved and more
                  affectionate lad of the two.</p>
               <p>At the age of fifteen, William Martin had, through the kind influence of a friend
                  of the widow's late husband, been taken into the office of a lawyer at Augusta,
                  where, at the date on which our story commences, he had resided four years. Frank,
                  as soon as his brother had gone forth from his mother's roof, to make his own way
                  in the world, began to urge the widow to consent to his wishes and give him her
                  permission to go to sea—although at this time he was but thirteen years of age.
                  This the widow would not consent to, and his sister Sarah also added her
                  persuasions to her mother's, for truly the widow had reason to dread the
                  vicissitudes of the treacherous element; she was the daughter of a sea captain,
                  who had perished at sea while engaged on a whaling voyage from Nantucket. She
                  thought that there was a fatality attending those of her family who ventured upon
                  a sea life—and hence shrunk with dread from the idea of either of her own children
                  becoming sailors; but all was of no avail—a sailor Frank Martin was resolved upon
                  being—and although he did not plead any longer with his mother, after once or
                  twice seeing her weep when he had pressed the subject with unusual warmth, for
                  Frank was an affectionate boy—for all his high spirits and mischievous pranks—he
                  secretly resolved that the sea should be his chosen profession at last, even if he
                  had to wait for years to attain his object, and commence his initiation in the
                  duty of gaining his own living in some other, and, to him, less congenial
                  employment. One thing, however, he determined upon, <emph>without</emph> his
                  mother's consent, he would not, while she lived, act against her wishes. He
                  trusted to time to work a change in her ideas. Meanwhile he attended school
                  regularly, and spent his leisure time as usual upon the beach or on the cliffs,
                  where, on a fine day, he would stroll for hours, looking longingly upon the vast
                  sluggish waters in the calm, or in imagination bounding in some gallant ship over
                  the swelling billows as they danced and sparkled, and foamed whilst borne onward
                  by the breeze.</p>
               <p>We have as yet said little of Sarah Martin, but it is at least necessary that we
                  give a partial description of this, the youngest of the Widow Martin's family,
                  since all the personages therein comprised will play their part individually in
                  the due course of our narrative.</p>
               <p>Sarah Martin, at this period, was only eight years of age; yet she already gave
                  promises of exceeding loveliness. Hers was not, however, beauty of the showy,
                  dashing description, calculated to make an instant impression on a heart sensitive
                  to the influence of feminine attractions, often proving as evanescent as it is
                  sudden and lively at the moment; beauty, but of that gentle, timid, retiring
                  character, which gradually but surely winds its coils around the heart of the
                  incautious beholder, and from which there is no escape—which only entangles him
                  who struggles to get free still more deeply in its meshes. At this period Sarah
                  was a lovely little girl, with large soft eyes, of a color which partook alike of
                  a shade of blue and gray, with long silken eyelashes, which drooped gracefully
                  over the lids when half closed, and dark, arched eyebrows, soft and silky as if
                  drawn with a limner's pencil. Her hair was of a rich brown auburn, and fell in
                  natural ringlets over her shoulders, forming a rich setting for her oval face, and
                  pretty, regular, delicate features. She was very fond of her brother Frank, and as
                  we have stated, would join her childish persuasions to those of her mother, and
                  entreat him not to go to sea and be drowned, as she was sure he would be, if he
                  ventured upon the treacherous element.</p>
               <p>About six mouths after William Martin had gone to live in Augusta, he sent a few
                  presents to his mother and brother and sister, not of great value in themselves,
                  but as a proof of his remembrance of them, and his wish that they should share in
                  the benefits derived from a gift bestowed upon him by his employer, as a proof of
                  his satisfaction with his conduct.</p>
               <p>Frank's share of his brother's generosity, consisted of two books, which William
                  had evidently chosen with a just appreciation of life younger brother's tastes—the
                  volumes consisted of Robinson Crusoe and Capt. Cook's voyages. Nothing could have
                  been more acceptable to Frank, who greedily perused their contents, and wished he
                  had lived in former years, and had had the good fortune to share the exploits and
                  dangers and triumphs of the gallant and adventurous Cook and his companions; but
                  Robinson Crusoe opened to his imagination a fairy world of delight. It was read
                  and re-read, each time with increasing satisfaction. Every word was believed by
                  the enthusiastic boy<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7191-00000027"/> to be strictly true,
                  and Robinson Crusoe was envied as having been the happiest of mankind.</p>
               <p>"Oh," sighed Frank, "Oh! that I could only be cast away upon some desert Island,
                  without food or clothing, and amongst lots of savage cannibals. How happy I should
                  be, and then if I could but get a Man Friday to help me to build a hut; and a
                  parrot to call out, 'Frank Martin! poor Frank Martin!' and a cat to follow me
                  about; and a goat-skin dress to wear. Oh, wouldn't it be jolly."</p>
               <p>From much musing upon this subject, Frank began to conceive a plan of establishing
                  a sort of Crusoe's dominion upon a rugged promontory, which extended from the
                  lower section of the cliff beneath his mother's dwelling, and which was only
                  accessible at low water, by scrambling over slimy and jagged rocks. Out of an old
                  buffalo robe which he managed to purloin from the house, he manufactured a mock
                  goatskin cap and coat, and his mother's tortoise shell cat supplied that important
                  addition to Crusoe's household. A natural cave at one end of the promontory served
                  for a ready-made habitation, as perfect as any Crusoe amateur could reasonably
                  desire, and a parrot he had ready to hand, for the widow had a favorite parrot,
                  which greatly to the wonder and distress of the lady, shared in the mysterious
                  disappearance of the cat, and though it could not say, "Frank Martin! oh, poor
                  Frank Martin!" it could and did screech, without ceasing, "What's o'clock, pretty
                  Polly? Poll, what's o'clock?" and that temporarily answered the purpose. A Man
                  Friday was a much more serious affair to be got over; but it was managed at
                  last—all things can be managed by those who <emph>will</emph>—though the Man
                  Friday was not a <emph>human</emph> subject of the amateur Crusoe. Frank pondered
                  long upon this difficulty; his object was to do the thing properly; and therefore
                  it was necessary that he should rescue his Man Friday from his pursuers, and that
                  he should do it on a Friday, too—or else, how could the name be appropriate?
                  Fortunately for the success of his scheme, one Friday just as he had stolen
                  secretly over to his cave to revel in his fancies for a few hours, he was startled
                  by the sound of a barrel organ—rather an unusual sound in those parts—and
                  notwithstanding Frank was attired in his buffalo, cap and all, he could not resist
                  the curiosity that impelled him to find out whence the sound proceeded. He
                  recrossed from the promontory, and peering round a projecting corner of the cliff,
                  espied two Italian organ boys, who were wending their way to Camden from the
                  village of Lincolnville. Forgetting in his curiosity the oddity of his attire, he
                  emerged from his hiding place—the boys saw his strange figure, and screaming with
                  affright, taking him to be some strange and savage brute, they started to run with
                  all haste along the pathway, while a monkey that was seated on the organ broke
                  loose from them, and also impelled by fear, rushed down the cliff to the beach,
                  and across the bridge of rocks which led to Frank's imaginary domain.</p>
               <p>It was a Godsend to Frank—a Man Friday was on the very day of the week presented
                  to his hand, actually flying from his captors and taking refuge in
                     <emph>his</emph> cave, for in that recess, the poor frightened brute secreted
                  itself, and was then easily captured by Frank—and therefrom retained a prisoner
                  until it began to know and be attached to its master. The Italian boys grieved
                  over the loss of their monkey, which they believed had fallen a prey to some
                  monster which had suddenly sprung up from the deep; but they never sought to
                  recover it, being glad to make their own escape. Frank now had everything
                  complete—and spent most of his leisure time in his cave, still poring over, and
                  gathering fresh ideas with regard to his pursuits from his favorite volume. His
                  mother and sister often remonstrated with him on account of his absenting himself
                  so much from the cottage; but he always excused himself, by saying that he had
                  been strolling along the cliff, and thus carefully kept his secret.</p>
               <p>One day, however, a cousin of the widow's—who was a sea captain, paid her a visit.
                  He asked after her son Frank—Mrs. Martin replied that she supposed he was
                  strolling upon the cliffs, to which amusement he showed a great partiality.</p>
               <p>"Then," said the captain, "I will take a stroll out, and look about me, and
                  perhaps I may fall in with the boy."</p>
               <p>Thus saying, he took his hat and walked leisurely along the cliff. He saw nothing,
                  however, of Frank, and was on the point of returning to the cottage, for it was
                  growing dusk, when turning a point, his attention was arrested by a human figure
                  beneath him, apparently struggling with the tide. It was Frank—who was also
                  thinking of returning home, and who having waited until the water had nearly
                  covered the bridge of rocks which formed the road to his domain, had stripped
                  himself in order to cross without wetting his clothes, which he had tied up in a
                  bundle and was carrying on his head. The captain gained the beach as quietly as
                  possible, in the hope of<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7191-00000028"/> rescuing what he
                  believed to be a lad struggling for life amidst the rocks, for he had no idea any
                  one could have voluntarily placed himself in such a position, and he just arrived
                  in time to see his young cousin land on the beach.</p>
               <p>"Why, Frank!" cried he, in amazement, "what on earth have you been doing out on
                  that jut of rock?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Captain Dobson," replied Frank—to whom the captain was well known, and
                  with whom he was a great favorite—"please wait till I put on my clothes, and I
                  will go home with you; but don't say anything to mother or to Sarah."</p>
               <p>"And why not, Frank?"</p>
               <p>"Because—because," repeated Frank—"I often go there—and I don't want them to
                  know."</p>
               <p>"Why, what attraction is there, Frank? <emph>I</emph> shall step across myself, at
                  low tide to-morrow, and see."</p>
               <p>"Please don't," implored Frank.</p>
               <p>The captain laughed. "Then tell me your secret," said he.</p>
               <p>"Will you keep it?"</p>
               <p>"That depends on circumstances. At all events, if there is no danger to yourself
                  in it, I shall not say anything to annoy you."</p>
               <p>"Then I will tell you," said the boy, after musing for some time, and he told his
                  good natured cousin of his scheme.</p>
               <p>"Upon my word," said the captain, laughing as he listened to the explanation. "I
                  must visit this Robinson Crusoe's cave of yours, Frank—I will go with you to your
                  domain to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"You won't say anything about it to mother to-night?"</p>
               <p>"No, make yourself easy on that score"—and thus chatting together, the captain and
                  his young cousin wended their way along the cliff to the widow's cottage.</p>
               <p>On the morrow Frank showed his cousin the mysteries of the promontory and the
                  natural cave.</p>
               <p>"And you have stolen the parrot that I brought your mother from the West Indies,
                  the strange loss of which she has been lamenting to me. Oh, Frank, you should not
                  have taken the parrot without your mother's leave, and the old tortoise shell cat.
                  I declare! and what the d—I this? a monkey, by all that's wonderful.</p>
               <p>"Why, what do you do with a monkey, Frank?"</p>
               <p>"That's my Man Friday," replied Frank, gravely, and he proceeded to tell his
                  cousin how he had got possession of it.</p>
               <p>"Why, you are a most romantic youth," said the captain, after having given way to
                  a burst of laughter, "but I must tell your mother where her parrot is secreted.
                  What put such a fancy as this into your head?"</p>
               <p>"I wish to be a sailor," replied the boy, "and mother won't let me; but I never
                  will be anything else."</p>
               <p>The captain was silent for some minutes; at length he said—</p>
               <p>"Frank, I shall tell your mother what I have discovered, for I don't think it safe
                  for you to visit this place. Some day you will be carried away by the tide in
                  attempting to cross; but as a recompense for breaking up your favorite amusement,
                  I will endeavor to persuade your mother to let you go to sea with <emph>me.</emph>
                  I think I can manage it, since you are so determined upon it."</p>
               <p>"Oh, if you can persuade her to that, your are welcome to tell her all."</p>
               <p>That very evening the captain broached the subject to his cousin, and obtained her
                  reluctant consent. The parrot and the favorite tortoise shell were returned to
                  their mistress, who said little to her son with regard to their loss—for she had
                  not the heart to breathe a word of reproach, now that he was about to leave her,
                  and even jocko was well housed in a vacant dog kennel and taken under the
                  protection of Sarah.</p>
               <p>Frank's object thus unexpectedly obtained, the promontory was restored to its
                  original solitude, and Frank, it was arranged, should go with his cousin to New
                  York, and sail as cabin boy with him in one of Mr. Mordant's ships—which the
                  captain commanded. A week from this period, after having bidden a tender adieu to
                  his mother and sister, and receiving numerous warnings and admonitions from the
                  former relative to his conduct, and with regard to the necessity of not exposing
                  himself too much to the night air during his voyage, and always wearing a night
                  cap when he went to bed, and saying his prayers, and reading his Bible, and
                  keeping the Sabbath day holy, and various other advice, which the widow gave in
                  her solicitude and ignorance of nautical habits, and which the youth promised to
                  obey, which made the captain smile to himself—but did not think it necessary to
                  explain; and, above all, bidding him never, never to forget his mother, and
                  receiving a hundred kisses from his sister, and promising her treasures such as
                  she had never dreamed of, to be brought from foreign parts, Frank Martin started
                  with his cousin to New York, and was immediately installed as cabin boy in Captain
                  Dobson's ship.</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7191-00000029"/>
               <p>Frank found that he had many disagreeable duties to perform, that he had not
                  thought of in his aspirations after a sailor's life; but he was too manly to
                  complain—and he set to work at once and cheerfully endeavored to fulfil his
                  duties. A few weeks afterwards the vessel sailed—Frank having meanwhile written to
                  his mother and sister, taking care to daub the letters with a little tar as an
                  emblem of the change in his life—and to give the paper a true ship-like
                  flavor.</p>
               <p>He sailed several voyages with Captain Dobson, until the latter retired from the
                  sea, and then, after a brief visit to his home, he was placed by Mr. Mordant, by
                  his own request, on board the Albatross, where we first introduced him to the
                  reader.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Albatross on her voyage—Harry is startled by discovering a locket
                     containing the portrait of a beautiful female in the captain's cabin, and
                     discovers the original in the Recluse of Annabon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE left Captain Seymour in a great state of anxiety with regard to the character
                  of the vessel which had been descried by the man on the look-out aloft. The second
                  mate, who had been ordered by the captain to look through his glass and give his
                  opinion, whether or not they were the topgallant sails of the stranger that he
                  could discern from the deck, peered long and anxiously—</p>
               <p>"I think, Captain Seymour, it is only a cloud—the outline seems undefined," said
                  he, at length.</p>
               <p>"I am half inclined to think so myself," responded the captain, putting aside his
                  glass, and walking to and fro for some minutes; he then raised the spy-glass
                  again, and peered long in the same direction—</p>
               <p>"No; by heavens! it is the upper sail of the stranger that I see. I can discern
                  her topsails now—the haze is clearing."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, the man aloft sung out, "On deck there."</p>
               <p>"Halloa!" replied the captain.</p>
               <p>"We are nearing the strange sail, sir. She must have seen us, and hove to. I can
                  see the black line of her bulwarks since the haze has lifted."</p>
               <p>"We must creep further to windward, Mr. Tolcroft," said the captain. "See that the
                  yards are braced sharp up."</p>
               <p>"For'ard, there! brace the yards sharp up," shouted the first mate.</p>
               <p>"How does the vessel bear now, my man?" shouted the captain, when the order had
                  been effected. "I have lost sight of the white speck again," he added, addressing
                  the mate. "D—n this confounded haze—it's rising from the water like a thick
                  fog."</p>
               <p>"She was on our lee quarter this moment, sir," replied the man; "but the fog is so
                  thick that I have lost sight of her."</p>
               <p>"Keep a bright look-out, and hail the deck if you catch a glimpse of her again,"
                  shouted the captain. "Keep her close my man," he added to the man at the helm.
                  "Quartermaster, see that the steering is well attended to. We will keep on this
                  course for an hour or two, and then I will bear down upon her until I am satisfied
                  as to her quality.</p>
               <p>Having given this order he descended to the cabin to finish his breakfast. In the
                  course of half an hour he was again on deck. The sun was shining forth
                  brilliantly, and the heat was growing oppressive. The haze was fast clearing off;
                  and, in the course of a few minutes, the man aloft again hailed the deck, saying
                  that he could distinctly see the outline of the hall again. The strange sail was
                  soon seen distinctly from the deck, with the aid of the glasses, and it became
                  very apparent that she was "lying to."</p>
               <p>"It must be our consort, sir," said the mate. "Were she one of the cruisers she
                  would have given chase, seeing us making to windward, for she must see that we
                  don't mean to show fight."</p>
               <p>"I rather incline to think it is," answered the captain; "but it may be only a
                  trick to deceive us. As to fighting, that is never worth while with an empty ship,
                  where nothing is to be gained but hard blows. If we were full, it would be another
                  matter. However," he added, "the wind is dying away, and it would be as well, now
                  we are well to windward, to examine her closer, and satisfy ourselves. Square the
                  yards, Mr. Tolcroft, and we will edge towards her at any rate."</p>
               <p>The yards were squared and the mainsail hauled up, and thus the bows of the
                  Albatross were brought to bear almost directly towards the stranger. The wind was
                  now light, but an hour's sail brought the two vessels sufficiently near for the
                  captains to scan each other with the aid of the spyglasses.</p>
               <p>The stranger had squared her main yard, when the Albatross had altered her course,
                  and, at the same time, had<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7191-00000030"/> diminished the
                  speed she would otherwise have made, by hauling up both her courses and lowering
                  her topgallant sails.</p>
               <p>In this movement there was an evidence of a desire of nearer approach, and, at the
                  same time, of caution, that satisfied the captain of the Albatross that he was
                  right in his conjecture as to the character of the vessel, and that it was his
                  expected consort that he had fallen in with. He hoisted his private signals,
                  which, in the course of a few minutes, were responded to on board the other
                  vessel, and the main yard of the stranger was again laid aback, and by this means,
                  in a short time, the vessels were within hail of each other. Captain Seymour was
                  the first to seize the speaking trumpet.</p>
               <p>"Ship ahoy!" shouted he; "what ship is that?"</p>
               <p>"The Dolphin," was the reply that came booming over the water, as the gruff voice
                  of the commander of the strange vessel shouted in reply. "That is the Albatross, I
                  presume," he continued, in a slightly foreign accent, "though I should scarcely
                  recognize her, she looks so trim to what she was when I last saw her."</p>
               <p>"The Albatross, it is," replied Captain Seymour. "How are you, Captain Junot.
                  What's the news?"</p>
               <p>"Ha! Captain Seymour," was the reply, now distinctly audible, as the vessels
                  neared each other. "By gar, I am glad to see you. Vat is de news you shall ask?
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ma foi! c'est miserable.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"What is the matter? Have you no cargo on board?" asked the captain of the
                  Albatross.</p>
               <p>"Cargo—<foreign xml:lang="FRA">non diable! sacre tonnere,</foreign> not von bit of
                  luck I've had since I leave New Orleans."</p>
               <p>"The devil!" exclaimed Seymour. Then he added: "Lower your boat, Junot, and come
                  aboard, and let's hear the news in detail from your own lips."</p>
               <p>Captain Junot gave the necessary orders to lower the boat, and in a few minutes he
                  descended the side, and ordered his men to pull alongside the Albatross, on board
                  of which he was cordially welcomed by Captain Seymour.</p>
               <p>The boat's crew of the strange ship consisted of half a dozen rough-looking
                  fellows, attired in red woollen caps and flannel shirts; while seated beside the
                  captain, in the stern sheets, was a truculent, dark complexioned man, whose
                  distinctive garb proclaimed him to be an officer, for he wore a fancifully-trimmed
                  silk jacket, with a strip of gold lace on one shoulder, and a gold lace band
                  around his cap.</p>
               <p>Captain Junot himself was attired in a similarly fanciful uniform, the only
                  difference in their dress being that the captain wore a gold badge on both
                  shoulders. His personal appearance was even less prepossessing than that of his
                  lieutenant, for he was a short, thick-set man, strongly marked with the small-pox,
                  which disease had rendered one eye useless, and it remained fixed in the socket,
                  while the other orb, small, but black as jet, rolled about incessantly beneath his
                  low brow, and thick, heavy, grizzled eyebrows. His complexion was tanned almost to
                  the blackness of a negro, and his thick and coarse hair, as well as the thicket of
                  moustache and beard that covered the lower part of his face, concealing his mouth
                  from view, was blanched to a dull grey. Add to this, the mark of a cicatrized
                  wound across his furrowed cheek, which the forest of hair upon his face did
                     <emph>not</emph> conceal, and it will be confessed that, despite his gay
                  attire, Captain Junot was no Adonis.</p>
               <p>A greater contrast could not exist between two human beings than existed between
                  the captains of the two slavers, as they shook hands upon the deck of the
                  Albatross.</p>
               <p>The elegant form and handsome features of Captain Seymour looked still more
                  elegant and handsome as he stood alongside his ill-favored comrade.</p>
               <p>The other officer also appeared to be well known to Captain Seymour, for, after
                  welcoming Junot on board, he extended his hand to his companion, saying—</p>
               <p>"And you are welcome, too, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor Contramæstre.</foreign> I
                  am glad to see you. Why I thought you were still in jail at Havana."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Estese quieto Capitano,</foreign>" replied the individual
                  thus addressed, in Spanish. "Gold opens all locks, however strong." And he gave a
                  knowing wink, which, although intended for pleasantry, singularly increased his
                  ugliness.</p>
               <p>"Come down into the cabin and let's hear the bad news you speak of," said Captain
                  Seymour to his visitors; and then saying to the mate—</p>
               <p>"Keep a good look-out, Mr. Tolcroft, that the vessels don't come too close
                  together," he descended with the French commander and his Spanish <foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">contramæstre</foreign> into the cabin.</p>
               <p>From them he learnt, amidst a whole vocabulary of French and Spanish oaths, that
                  the Dolphin had been for six weeks upon the coast watching an opportunity to run
                  in shore; but the vicinity of that part of the coast, upon which they expected to
                  find the living cargo they were in search of, was so<pb n="58-59"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000031"/> closely watched by British cruisers, that they had
                  not dared to approach the land.</p>
               <p>This information they had derived from a native, war-canoe, belonging to King
                  Kettle, who was the owner of the slaves that were in waiting for the expected
                  ships, and who was allowed to sail to and fro along the coast, in consequence of
                  the belief entertained that he was in league with the British to put down the
                  system of slave dealing, so commonly practised by the native chiefs. The
                  information of the anticipated arrival of two slayers, and of a large cargo of
                  slaves being secreted somewhere along the line of coast, had been given by the
                  captain of a merchant ship, trading for ivory, who had learnt it from a Krooman
                  who had been inveigled by the chief into aiding him in procuring the slaves, under
                  false pretences, and who had paid the forfeit of his temerity by being tortured
                  and sacrificed as a propitiatory offering to <hi rend="i"/>Cassa Jumba (the
                  devil.) Bitter vengeance was sworn by Captain Junot and his mate if ever they fell
                  in with the merchantman.</p>
               <p>"But what metal do the crusiers carry?—they surely did not cruise in company?"
                  replied Captain Seymour. "If I knew a cargo was awaiting me in any particular
                  spot—although I am opposed to fighting, if it can be avoided—I would have risked
                  the chance against a single cruiser, sooner than loose the spoil."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Madre de Dios!</foreign> the devils carry ten guns each,"
                  replied the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Contramæstre.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Sainte Vierge!</foreign>" exclaimed Captain Junot, in the
                  same breath, "the Dolphin only carries six guns, and she would be quite unable to
                  cope with the Englishman."</p>
               <p>"Nevertheless, although the Albatross is a smaller vessel, and only carries the
                  same armament, I shall not hesitate to approach the coast," replied Seymour.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Vous etes trop courageux Capitaine</foreign>" said Junot,
                  respectfully; for it was evident from the general bearing of the strangers that
                  they acknowledged the captain of the Albatross as their superior.</p>
               <p>If the test of superiority was left to the peculiar management, and the discipline
                  maintained on board the two vessels, it was most surely in Captain Seymour's
                  favor; for the Dolphin's decks would have given one an idea of the infernal
                  regions let loose: yet she was a beautiful craft—small, not perhaps above four
                  hundred tons register; but she had a smart and clipper-like look, and from the
                  flashing of her bright copper, showing that she was in light sailing trim, the
                  square cut of her sails, the symmetrical arrangement of her spars and rigging, and
                  her quarter boats—she looked so much like a man of war, that Captain Seymour was
                  quite justifiable with regard to the caution he had observed in approaching her.
                  With this, however, all similarity to a regular cruiser ceased; although her crew
                  was more numerous than that of the Albatross, consisting of forty-five or fifty
                  hands, it was not, as in the case of the Albatross, composed of American seamen,
                  but was a mixture, apparently, from the officers downwards, of all the nations
                  under the sun—there even being several negroes amongst it—and the decks were
                  dirty, the men lying idly about, except those actually on duty; while no sort of
                  discipline seemed to be maintained.</p>
               <p>In the course of an hour, the captain and <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >contræmastre</foreign> of the Dolphin returned on board, and the two vessels
                  parted company, the Albatross steering direct for the coast, while the fears of
                  the captain of the Dolphin still urged him to hang aloof.</p>
               <p>Henry Davis, who, when he shipped on board the Albatross, had not possessed the
                  slightest idea of the real character of the vessel, found himself in a very
                  uncomfortable position; and he could not reconcile himself to the idea that Mr.
                  Mordant could really be aware of the destination of his ship. His only confidant
                  was Frank Martin; and he being now engaged forward with the crew, he seldom was
                  able to converse with him. The two lads did, however, now and then, in the first
                  watch, find a few minutes leisure to chat together, and Frank did his best to
                  cheer the spirits of his shipmate. If he felt any uneasiness himself, he never
                  showed it before Harry; but would say, in reply to the other's remarks:</p>
               <p>"We can't help it; and therefore, my maxim is, 'Let us make the best of a bad
                  bargain, and keep a still tongue in our heads.' If we are heard to grumble, trust
                  me, we shall soon become food for the sharks."</p>
               <p>As to Harry's expressed doubts of Mr. Mordant's knowledge of the destination of
                  his vessel, he would reply:</p>
               <p>"Trust me, Harry, he knows all about it. I have heard hints of this before;
                  though, to tell the truth, I never believed them."</p>
               <p>"But," said Harry, during one of these conversations—for his ideas respecting the
                  avocations of slavers were not very clearly defined, and he confounded them with
                  those of pirates—of whose dreadful deeds he had often read—"surely, we shall<pb
                     n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7191-00000032"/> not sink any peaceable merchant ships we
                  come across and compel the crews to walk the plank, as I have read of?"</p>
               <p>"No," Frank replied—"I don't suppose we shall; though, for the matter of that, I
                  don't imagine Captain Seymour would miss a good chance where the risk was worth
                  anything. I tell you, Harry, I have no good opinion of Captain Seymour; for all
                  his good looks and gentle voice, when nothing ruffles his temper. But I often
                  wonder what made you take to a seafaring life. You are so timid and quiet. There
                  must have been some strange reason for your choice. I should like, some day, to
                  learn your history."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps, some day, and <emph>too</emph> soon, you may learn it," said
                  Harry—speaking the last words inaudibly—as he left the deck to reply to the
                  summons of the cabin bell.</p>
               <p>The weather had become almost calm, and the Albatross made but very slow progress
                  towards the point of her destination on the coast; and the captain passed a
                  considerable portion of his time lolling on a sofa he had brought on deck, and
                  placed beneath the awning. He was thus actuated, partly in consequence of the
                  sultry weather, and partly by the natural anxiety he felt, as he neared the land
                  and feared interruption from the cruisers.</p>
               <p>One day, just after he had gone on deck, some duty or other called Harry into the
                  after cabin, on the sofa in which the captain had been reclining. Lying upon the
                  sofa was a locket with a piece of black ribbon attached to it, which Harry had
                  frequently seen around Captain Seymour's neck. Curiosity prompted him to unclasp
                  it, and the moment he did so he started back as if struck with a panic; his breath
                  was for a moment suspended, and the blood forsook his cheeks, while the next
                  moment it bounded back from his heart, dyeing his clear olive skin to the color of
                  crimson. An ejaculation of pain burst from his lips, and he almost allowed the
                  trinket to slip from his hands. In a few minutes, however, he recovered himself,
                  and stood gazing intently upon the portrait in the locket, although his breast
                  still heaved convulsively; and yet there was nothing apparently to cause this
                  perturbation in the portrait he held in his hands. It was the face and bust of a
                  most beautiful female, with the peculiar almond-shaped eyes of the maidens of the
                  East, and a rich profusion of yellow hair, contrasting singularly with the rare
                  beauty of the dark eyes and eyebrows and long silken eyelashes. The features were
                  regular as those of the Greek Ideal; the brow was low and broad, the nose, mouth,
                  and chin of the purest Grecian cast, the nostrils thin and finely curved, almost
                  seeming to breathe with life in the picture, the lips were of a rosy red, slightly
                  parted, and displaying a row of teeth, white and even as pearls; and the
                  complexion was of the clearest white and red. Harry could not withdraw his gaze.
                  Was it the surpassing beauty of the portrait that enchanted him? So Captain
                  Seymour appeared to think; for while the boy stood thus seemingly entranced, the
                  captain descended into the cabin, unheard by him, and stood behind him, gazing
                  intently upon him, apparently pleased with the admiration with which he fancied
                  the boy was gazing upon the picture. He had always been particularly gentle and
                  conciliating to Harry, treating him more like a companion than as his cabin boy,
                  often lending him books, and appearing to find relief in his conversation from the
                  rude companionship of his officers and crew, and he was not displeased with what
                  he conceived the boy's admiration of the lovely countenance he was examining. At
                  length he said—</p>
               <p>"Why, Harry, you seem quite enchanted with that portrait. Well, in a few days you
                  may perhaps see the original; but, my boy, you must not look upon <emph>her</emph>
                  with such evident admiration," and he smiled as he spoke—"or I shall grow
                  jealous."</p>
               <p>Harry started, and again the color forsook his cheeks. Perhaps it was through
                  fear—evidently the captain thought it was—for he continued:</p>
               <p>"Boy! I am not angry with you. No one could look on that lovely face unmoved. I
                  have admired many maidens—almost loved some—but I have never <emph>really</emph>
                  loved any one but her."</p>
               <p>Harry trembled still in every limb, but the captain did not seem to observe him,
                  for he took the locket from his hand, and sat himself down on the sofa, and for
                  some minutes appeared buried in thought. His features assumed a mildness, almost a
                  gentleness, that Harry had never before observed, even in his most pleasant
                  moods.</p>
               <p>"Harry," he at length said, "I heard you reading aloud the other day, boy. You
                  read well; your voice is soft and musical as a woman's. Come here and read to me.
                  I am in a strange wayward mood to-day."</p>
               <p>Harry came forward at his captain's call, having hardly yet recovered his
                  composure. He advanced to the book-shelves; but seemed to hesitate what book he
                  should take down.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7191-00000033"/>
               <p>"Reach down Byron's poems, Harry," continued the captain, "and read from the
                  'Bride of Abydos,' commencing— <q>
                     <p>'Fair as the first that fell of womankind.'</p>
                  </q> and continue on through the verse."</p>
               <p>Harry obeyed, and read in a voice that sounded tremulously sweet, the more so in
                  consequence of the boy's emotion, until he had reached the concluding line— <q>
                     <l>"And oh, that eye was in itself a soul."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Captain Seymour had listened attentively to the first few lines, but ere the boy
                  had concluded, his thoughts appeared to wander, for he did not for some moments
                  observe that he had ceased. At length he raised his head and said—</p>
               <p>"Most admirably read, boy. Where did you acquire that rich soft voice? It reminds
                  me of——Bah!—no matter; turn over the pages and read the concluding lines of 'The
                  Corsair,' commencing at the verse— <q>
                     <l>"'His heart was formed for softness, warped to wrong.'"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Again Harry read, and this time the captain sat gazing intently at him, and
                  listening to the beautiful verses of the poem. It was concluded, and the captain
                  repeated aloud, and half unconsciously, the last line, <q>
                     <l>"Linked with one virtue and a thousand crimes."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"That will do, boy," he said, "you can go. You are a good boy, and some day must
                  tell me your history. You are not what you seem."</p>
               <p>The boy started, and looked earnestly and half fearfully at the captain; but he
                  was again, apparently, deeply absorbed in thought.</p>
               <p>The captain's gentle mood did not last long. Towards evening of that very day it
                  fell calm, and for a week the ship scarcely made any headway. The sea was smooth
                  as the surface of a mirror, while a thin scum covered it as far as the eye could
                  reach, and a light thin haze floated above to the height of two or three feet,
                  which reflected a glare from the rays of the tropical sun, glancing perpendicular
                  upon it, that was oppressive in the extreme, not only prostrating the physical
                  faculties, but depressing, also, the spirits of the crew; the sails hung in heavy
                  folds against the masts, and the decks and sides of the vessel were so heated that
                  the pitch fairly boiled out of the seams—while the iron and brass work was
                  rendered too hot to be touched even by the hard, horny hands of the seamen. It was
                  a situation calculated to try the temper of the most equable disposition, and
                  Captain Seymour fretted and raged after a fashion that fairly terrified those with
                  whom he came in contact. We have remarked, that hitherto he had been kindly
                  disposed towards Harry; now, however, he was querulous with him. Nothing pleased
                  him; his books, his chief companions during his leisure hours, were neglected; and
                  he was never a quarter of ah hour at rest night or day. The crew felt the change
                  severely; hitherto he had issued his orders to the mates, having only on very rare
                  occasions communicated them directly to the seamen. Now the watch was never at
                  rest; the sails were continually being uselessly shifted; they were kept
                  constantly wetted in the hope that they might catch and hold the slightest chance
                  flaw of wind—the standing rigging was set up again and again, as it relaxed under
                  the intense heat, and, at a time when it was a difficulty and trouble even to
                  move, the men were kept constantly busy; yet they dared not complain. There was
                  something in the tone of Captain Seymour's voice, and in his look, that told them
                  he was not to be trifled with. On one occasion, only, a stout, burly seaman
                  ventured to grumble, though almost inaudibly, at what he conceived to be some
                  unnecessary order. In a moment a powerful blow from the captain's muscular arm,
                  well directed and aimed at the man's temple, laid him senseless upon the deck,
                  cutting a deep wound, and causing a contusion of the brain. The poor man fell over
                  the raised poop upon the deck below, but the captain merely turned to some of his
                  messmates who were looking on in terror, and said calmly—more calmly than he had
                  spoken for many days—</p>
               <p>"Take that mutinous dog to his hammock and see to him," and then resumed his
                  orders as though nothing had happened.</p>
               <p>At length the long looked for breeze sprang up, the almost stagnant sea resumed
                  its billowy motion, the haze cleared away, and the Albatross went gaily bounding
                  on her course at the rate of six knots an hour. The captain's good humor returned,
                  and though he still remained a good deal on deck, he again left the management of
                  his ship to his officers, contenting himself with the duty of keeping a sharp
                  look-out around, often spending an hour at a time in the topmast cross tiers,
                     scanning<pb n="64" xml:id="VAC7191-00000034"/> the horizon with his glass in
                  all directions. Harry had never yet been aloft, but one morning the captain
                  ascended the rigging without his spyglass, and he called Harry to bring it up to
                  him.</p>
               <p>The boy obeyed, but in descending the cat-harpings, after having delivered the
                  glass into the captain's hands, he suddenly became giddy—the ship careened over to
                  a sudden gust of wind, and as she righted and slightly inclined over again to
                  windward, he fell headlong into the sea. Fortunately he had fallen with the
                  weather roll or he must have tumbled in board, and in all probability have been
                  instantly killed—as it was, the coldness of the water restored him; he rose to the
                  surface and attempted to swim. He was, however, evidently frightened, and
                  unacquainted with the exercise, for he tossed his arms wildly about, and it was
                  doubtful whether he could have kept himself above water until a boat could have
                  been lowered to his rescue.</p>
               <p>The captain had descended shortly after the boy had reached him the glass, and
                  coming down the rigging more rapidly, he was only a few feet above him when he
                  fell.</p>
               <p>"Lay the main yard aback and lower a boat," he shouted, and the next moment he
                  plunged into the water, and striking out, caught the struggling youth just as he
                  was on the point of sinking for the second time. The boat was lowered, and both
                  were brought on board—no mischief having occurred further than the fright which
                  Harry had received.</p>
               <p>"Go below and strip yourself, boy," said the captain to the lad—"a pretty fellow
                  you are for a sailor. You have caused me to lose my best spy-glass—and that is
                  more than you are worth. Here, stay," he added; "I will send Frank aft to help
                  you—and send some dry clothes on deck to me."</p>
               <p>"I can do without help," said the boy timidly.</p>
               <p>"Pooh! nonsense. Here, Frank, go below and get this lubberly fellow some dry
                  clothes."</p>
               <p>Frank obeyed, and descended to the cabin with Harry, but he soon reappeared with a
                  bundle of clothing for the captain, which Harry had desired him to carry up, and
                  when Frank returned he found that Harry had already stripped himself and put on
                  his dry clothing.</p>
               <p>"You are smart enough in putting on your toggery, at any rate," said Frank. By
                  Jove! it was lucky for you that the captain jumped overboard after you, or you
                  would have gone to Davy Jones' locker, sure enough, before the boat could have
                  reached you. I didn't give the captain credit for so much humanity<pb

                  returned to the deck.</p>
               <p>A day or two afterwards the ship reached the meridian of Cape Palmas, and standing
                  close hauled on the larboard tack, steered across the Gulf of Guinea—holding a W.
                  S. W. course to Majumba, a port in Loango, to the northward of the capital, where
                  the captain expected to find his cargo ready for him. A few days brought the
                  vessel in sight of the small, beautifully wooded island of Annabon, the southern
                  shore of which the Albatross closely hugged—so closely, indeed, that the
                  enchanting scenery of the island was plainly distinguishable. The captain kept a
                  white flag flying at the gaffend, all the time the land was in sight, and stood on
                  the quarter deck with a spyglass to his eye, intently gazing at one particular
                  spot. The vessel was still a considerable distance from the shore, but some of the
                  sailors said they fancied they could discern a similar white flag fluttering in
                  the breeze amongst the dark green foliage. Whether or not, the captain seemed
                  satisfied; for as the island gradually receded from view he lowered his glass, and
                  during the remainder of the day was in a particularly amiable temper. In the
                  evening a double allowance of grog was issued to the crew, and for the first time
                  during the voyage the mates were invited to dine at the captain's table.</p>
               <p>Three days after they sighted the main land, and towards nightfall anchored off
                  the little native town of Majumba.</p>
               <p>In the course of the evening several canoes filled with negroes came on board,
                  each canoe bearing a chief. They were, generally speaking, fine, athletic looking
                  men, with forms that would have served as models for the sculptor's chisel, and as
                  they were all entirely naked, every opportunity was given of judging of their
                  physical perfection. They were unmistakably negroes, but they had nothing in
                  common with the repulsiveness of the slave negro in their open countenances. They
                  were deeply scarified across the chest and on the calves of the legs—not with the
                  handsome, regular tattoo of the South Sea islanders, but with deeply cut, gaping,
                  black wounds, which had cicatrized, and left frightful scars, the only drawback to
                  their generally fine appearance. The chiefs, however, were distinguishable by
                  their uncommon and unique finery, which appeared to have been borrowed from the
                  cast-off dresses of some theatrical wardrobe, and scrambled for and appropriated
                  promiscuously by the wearers.</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7191-00000037"/>
               <p>The garments had probably been the gifts of various slave captains and captains of
                  men-of-war and merchantmen, who had at different periods visited the coast, and
                  the chiefs certainly presented a motley appearance. One, for instance, who seemed
                  to think himself of no little importance, had decked himself out in a woman's
                  flannel petticoat, over which he wore the red jacket of a marine, while a woollen
                  nightcap covered his head, and his feet were encased, one in a dress pump, and the
                  other in a huge sea boot. One had a sailor's jacket only, which he wore closely
                  buttoned round his body, while all the rest of his person was entirely naked.
                  Another took pride in a pair of blue navy pantaloons with gold lace stripes, but
                  disdaining the servile fashion of crippling the limbs by wearing them in the
                  ordinary manner, he wore them buttoned round his neck with the legs dangling
                  behind. Some had nothing but vests; the garments of others were confined to a
                  simple pair of knee-breeches—rarely, however, worn where breeches ought to be. One
                  stalwart savage, totally naked otherwise, rejoiced in a pair of long woollen hose,
                  drawn up above the knee, the feet of which having worn out, had been cut off at
                  the ancles, and, ornamented with feathers, were worn about the owner's neck, and
                  esteemed as a most powerful <emph>fetish,</emph> upon which no evil eye of man or
                  beast could look and remain scathless; but the crowning glory of attire was that
                  worn by the celebrated King Kettle, well known in the annals of the slave trade,
                  and notorious for his skill and cunning in diplomacy, he having for a long period
                  managed to keep on equal good terms with the commanders of the English ships of
                  war that visited the coast and the captains of the slavers, who constituted his
                  best customers. This cunning and powerful chief wore an old cocked hat, which he
                  had himself gaily fringed with feathers; a blue dress coat, rather shabby and
                  threadbare, but the shabbiness of which was in a great measure atoned for by a
                  pair of officers' epaulettes which he had mounted on his shoulders. He had a stock
                  about his neck, but no shirt, vest, or pantaloons, although a black silk apron was
                  tied around his waist and hung down in front of his person, reaching nearly to his
                  knees. He discarded stockings, probably on account of the heat of the climate; but
                  his feet were encased in Blucher boots, considerably dilapidated. The ornament,
                  however, in the possession of which he chiefly prided himself, and from which he
                  had derived his European appellation, was a small copper tea-kettle, polished to
                  the utmost brightness, which was suspended from his shoulders ders by a leathern
                  strap, and dangled against his posteriors as he walked.</p>
               <p>The interior contained a varied and valued, if not valuable, assortment of sea
                  shells, pieces of old iron and copper, and pebbles, which made a most confounded
                  clatter as his majesty walked along with haughty stride, the kettle banging
                  against him at every step. It had been especially blessed by the sorcerers, and
                  was considered the most powerful <emph>fetish</emph> in the country, and the
                  source of all King Kettle's power and influence.</p>
               <p>Most of the members of this motley group were welcomed as old acquaintances by
                  Captain Seymour and his first and second mates, while the third mate and several
                  of the crew were also recognized by them, thus proving that although It was their
                  first voyage on board the Albatross, it was not their first visit to the slave
                  coast.</p>
               <p>The conversation was chiefly carried on in Spanish and French—few of the Natives,
                  not excepting the chiefs, being able to speak more than a few words of broken
                  English.</p>
               <p>
                  <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Aguardiente</foreign> was the first thing asked for, and
                  then tobacco in the leaf, both of which were moderately supplied. On being
                  questioned by the captain, the chiefs informed him that the whole line of coast
                  from, Majumba as far south as Loanda had been for many weeks narrowly watched by
                  two British men-of-war, and King Kettle had found it necessary to remove his
                  slaves to Quaddah, a village on the Zaire river, beyond where it was unnavigable
                  by any thing but native canoes, and a distance of seven days' journey from the
                  coast, in consequence of the men-of-war's boats having pulled a great many miles
                  up the river.</p>
               <p>King Kettle also mentioned with pride and satisfaction that he had entrapped the
                  captain and crew of the brig that had given information to the men-of-war, and had
                  massacred them all, and to prevent suspicion, had burnt the vessel, after having
                  robbed her of every portable article. It would, he added, be at least half a moon
                  or more before the slaves could be brought back to the coast, although he believed
                  the King of England—as he termed the ships-of-war—had got tired of waiting, and
                  fancying the information had been false, had sheered off, and had not been seen
                  for nearly a moon.</p>
               <p>Captain Seymour, finding that he had a great deal of leisure time on hand, left
                  the management of the vessel, until the arrival of the slaves, to his mates, and
                  resolved to pay a visit, on<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7191-00000038"/> private
                  business of his own, as he stated, to the island of Annabon, and with this object
                  he ordered the large pinnace which the Albatross carried for the purpose of
                  sailing up the rivers, after slaves, to be got ready, and supplied with a
                  fortnight's provisions, and taking with him half a dozen of his men and the cabin
                  boy, Harry, he immediately set sail for the island.</p>
               <p>Making long stretches during the day, and taking advantage of the land breezes at
                  night, the pinnace reached Annabon in three days from leaving Majumba, and Captain
                  Seymour landed at a native Portuguese village, consisting of a score or two of
                  wretched huts, and taking Harry with him, leaving his crew to take charge of the
                  pinnace, he walked a mile or two from the village along a wild native road
                  skirting the ocean, and winding amidst some of the richest verdure and most
                  enchanting scenery that the world can produce. Mangoes, bananas, limes, and other
                  tropical fruits, hung in clusters on the bushes that skirted the road, which was
                  little more than a beaten footpath—the trees forming an archway over the head at
                  an elevation of sometimes a hundred feet, thus sheltering the traveller from the
                  ardent solar rays, without obstructing the free current of air from the ocean.
                  After having proceeded for two miles, they came upon a cultivated clearing amidst
                  the forest, open to the sea—which was thickly studded with negro huts—and in the
                  rear of which was a small cottage with a verandah running around it after the
                  style of a West Indian country residence. A winding walk led to the cottage, edged
                  on either side with mango and other fruit trees in full blossom, or bearing rich
                  clusters of ripe fruit which perfumed the atmosphere. Several negroes welcomed the
                  appearance of the captain in Portuguese and broken Spanish; but he cautiously
                  enjoined silence, and reached the cottage without being observed by any of its
                  inmates.</p>
               <p>He entered the door without ceremony, appearing to be well acquainted with the
                  place, and proceeded to an inner apartment—bidding Harry wait in the passage.</p>
               <p>As the captain entered, Harry heard a musical female voice exclaim, in tones of
                  delight, "Ah! <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Caro mio Quien es</foreign> V"—a light,
                  bounding step flew to meet him—and then was heard the soft, indistinct murmur of
                  mutual caresses—the door was closed, and all was silent.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes the captain came out of the room, and taking a carpet bag which
                  Harry had carried up from the boat, he took from it a small casket, which he
                  desired Harry to carry into the room, while he looked over the contents of the
                  bag—adding, "Harry, I told you one day at sea you should see the original of that
                  portrait you so much admired; but beware, boy," he continued laughingly, "beware
                  of my warning."</p>
               <p>Harry felt as if he had been transported into some scene of enchantment. He
                  scarcely knew what the captain said, but he mechanically took the casket and
                  entered the room. At the first glance he was still more astonished and bewildered
                  by the light and airy elegance of the apartment. It appeared as though by some
                  magic spell a fairy abode had been dropped in the midst of a primeval wilderness;
                  but turning his head, an object met his gaze which attracted all his attention,
                  for, lounging in a languid yet elegant posture, upon a crimson silk ottoman, was
                  the original of the portrait in the locket, far surpassing in rich, living
                  loveliness, the exquisite beauty of the painting. She was attired in a Greek
                  costume, and a negress, fancifully dressed, was seated near her, holding a huge
                  fan in her hand, with which it appeared she had been fanning her lovely mistress.
                  Harry had read of the exquisite refinement and beauty of the interior arrangements
                  of the dwelling of the favored mistress of a Turkish harem. To his fancy it seemed
                  as though he had been suddenly transported into one of these forbidden abodes. He
                  stood transfixed with astonishment, and a mingling of overwhelming sensations. So
                  much was he bewildered, that he even hesitated when the sweet voice of the lovely
                  lounger bade him approach and deliver into her hands the gift of her HUSBAND.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Habla V. Castellano?</foreign>" she added, noticing the
                  hesitation of the youth.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Me alegro mucho de ver a V. Que es esto!</foreign>"
                  pointing to the casket.</p>
               <p>Thus addressed, although he knew but little of Spanish, Harry advanced to the lady
                  and placed the casket in her hand.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Muchisimos gracios,</foreign>" she replied, as she opened
                  the box, and took thence a jewelled miniature of Captain Seymour.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>A letter from a correspondent of Mr. Mordant's at Sierra Leone—Another
                     anonymous letter received by the Widow Miller—A letter from Captain Seymour,
                     denying any knowledge of the abduction of Jane Miller—Some account of the
                     widow's family—Charles Mordant endeavors to obtain money on the security of his
                     expectations.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE mentioned in a former chapter that Mr. Mordant had received a letter from a
                  correspondent on the African coast, which occasioned him some considerable
                  uneasiness. The letter was from his factor at Fernando Po, and it stated that the
                  ship Dolphin, Captain Junot, commander, in the success of which he had some
                  considerable interest, had, he had learnt, been driven from the coast in
                  consequence of the rigid watch after slavers that was kept up by the British
                  cruisers, and he feared that a fine assortment of slaves, admirably adapted for
                  the Cuban market, would be lost. He added that the Albatross, under the command of
                  Captain Seymour, was expected shortly to arrive upon the coast, and although he
                  had great confidence in Captain Seymour's judgment and discretion, he feared he
                  might rush on to his destruction. There was sufficient in this letter to occasion
                  the merchant a great deal of uneasiness. To be sure, if the Albatross should be
                  captured, he thought he would not actually lose money, but he would miss a fine
                  opportunity of making it, which was as much to be deplored as would be an actual
                  loss; but this was not all. The honest, upright, straightforward, and, in the
                  estimation of mankind, most worthy merchant, was fearful that, if the Albatross
                  should be suddenly captured, without giving time for Captain Seymour to make such
                  preparations as he might think advisable, his own good name might suffer, since
                  there were numerous letters and other matters that might be readily traced to
                  him.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Mr. Mordant was considerably harassed by the importunities and
                  complaints of the widow Miller, who was, as the reader is well aware, still
                  troubled with doubts in regard to the fate of her child. At first she had been
                  almost satisfied that the body of the unfortunate female found in the river had
                  been her daughter's, though she was at a loss to account for the manner of her
                  death; then again doubts arose in her mind, in consequence of the knowledge that
                  certain articles of her daughter's scanty wardrobe and store of jewelry had been
                  carried ried off, which were just the articles she imagined she would have chosen
                  to carry with her herself had she been going anywhere upon a long visit. Amidst
                  all these doubts she began to credit the suspicion that had arisen in her mind
                  that Captain Seymour must have been concerned in her flight from home, and that
                  possibly he had managed to secrete her somewhere, and she might be still living.
                  The mother's heart clung to this belief, and she besought Mr. Mordant to make such
                  inquiries of Captain Seymour as should set her mind at rest. To add to her
                  distress and uncertainty, though she did not place much faith in anonymous
                  letters, she had received a third letter from the same singular and mysterious
                  correspondent, which contained the following lines:</p>
               <p>"Madam, grieve not for the <emph>death</emph> of your child, if you would sooner
                  know that she still lived, though forever disgraced, than that she had passed away
                  from the earth forever. The body of the unfortunate female found in the North
                  River was <emph>not</emph> that of Jane Miller."</p>
               <p>The ambiguous phraseology of this letter troubled the widow exceedingly. It was
                  scarcely comprehensible to her. Sometimes she thought that some person was
                  trifling with her, but she could not bring herself to believe that any one could
                  be so heartless, merely for the sake of mystifying her and gratifying a cruel
                  propensity to sport with her harrowed feelings.</p>
               <p>She called, therefore, at the office of Mr. Mordant, down town, and implored him
                  so earnestly to write to Captain Seymour, and ascertain truly whether he knew any
                  thing respecting her daughter's fate, promising even, if he would only relieve her
                  anxiety, to pardon him the wrong he might have done to her daughter and herself,
                  that the merchant promised to write, and as he was himself anxious to know how
                  Captain Seymour had succeeded, and whether the fears of his agent had proved
                  groundless, he did write by the very earliest mail to Fernando Po.</p>
               <p>It was of course a long time before any answer was received; and when at last, a
                  letter from the Captain arrived, Mr. Mordant was relieved of a great deal of
                  anxiety, for Seymour said that he had evaded the cruisers—indeed they had, he
                  believed, left the vicinity of the Loango coast before he arrived there; that he
                  had secured a prime lot of negroes—young and healthy—and that there was still a
                  sufficient cargo left to fill up the Dolphin when she should arrive, which she<pb
                     n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7191-00000040"/> had not done at the date of his writing.
                  Then followed a few words of badinage at the poltroonery of Captain Junot, and the
                  captain concluded his letter in the following words:</p>
               <p>"By the way, there is one subject mentioned in your letter which has occasioned me
                  a great deal of uneasiness and annoyance. You ask me if I know any thing of the
                  unfortunate young lady, Jane Miller, and insinuate that probably I might have
                  abducted or kidnapped her from her home and carried her on board the Albatross.
                  You hint, also, that if I have so done, you will look it over, if I can manage to
                  set her on shore somewhere on the coast, or in the Brazils, on my return, so that
                  the affair may not be noised about in New York—and further, that if her mother is
                  satisfied that the girl is living, she will be relieved from much anxiety, and
                  yourself from much unpleasant importunity, if she is made aware that her daughter
                  is in some foreign land—and that under such circumstances you will take measures
                  to enable her to rejoin her. I desire to inform you <emph>positively,</emph> that
                  no one, even amongst her own relations—setting aside her mother—was more shocked
                  than I was myself, when I heard of her disappearance. I did not seek to entice her
                  on board the Albatross, and she is not on board that vessel; but if she were I
                  would not act up to your expressed wishes regarding her. I know that I am
                  accounted a sad fellow amongst females—but I wish you to know that I am incapable
                  of premeditated cruelty to any woman, however much I may disregard the feelings of
                  the sterner sex. I paid considerable attention to Miss Miller when I was last in
                  New York—more, much more than I was justified in doing. I thought her a most
                  fascinating girl. I was at her mother's house only a day or two before her
                  mysterious disappearance, and I walked out with her. Our conversation was serious,
                  and when I quitted her, after conducting her home, I left her weeping. I will
                  confess I have had sad forebodings respecting her fate; but although my own
                  conscience might not acquit me, if any thing serious should have happened to her,
                  I am at least legally innocent of any crime against her. You are at liberty to
                  show this letter, or rather this postscript, to Mrs Miller, and to rest assured I
                  am writing the truth. I positively know nothing respecting the fate of Jane
                  Miller."</p>
               <p>The merchant delivered the postscript into the widow's hands. He and she both felt
                  satisfied that the captain had written the truth, and the widow went home in
                  despair; the last straw of hope at which the drowning wretch catches, was snatched
                  from her.</p>
               <p>As to Mr. Mordant, he was much annoyed at the tone of the latter portion of the
                  letter. He perceived that Captain Seymour knew full well the independent position
                  which he held with regard to the merchant—his nominal employer—and he saw that it
                  would be necessary for him in future to be guarded in his expressions in order
                  that he might not offend the young seaman; besides, he was disappointed to a
                  certain degree, because Jane Miller was not on board the Albatross. He would far
                  sooner she had been forever cast off and lost to society, than that subsequent
                  discoveries should prove that the drowned female was really her, as thus a sort of
                  stigma might attach itself to his family, in consequence of the distant connection
                  with the deceased.</p>
               <p>When the clerical cousin of Mr. Mordant had died, he had left his little property
                  in the hands of the merchant, who was at that time a much poorer man than he was
                  at the date in which our story opens; but being even then extensively engaged in
                  mercantile business, the simple-hearted clergyman had believed that he would do
                  his best to increase the property, so that on her attaining her majority, Jane
                  might have at least a comfortable dowry to carry with her to the man whom she
                  might marry. The widow had some little property of her own, and it was therefore
                  with his wife's full consent that he had devised his daughter's property to be
                  subjected to the management of her guardian.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Miller had been informed a few years afterwards that there was a flaw in the
                  title deeds of the property, and that it had been given up in consequence of an
                  original Dutch claim having been preferred; and as she had perfect trust in the
                  integrity of her late husband's cousin, she had believed him, and had instituted
                  no inquiry. She had expressed her regret at the unfortunate change in her child's
                  future prospects, and that was all. Thus matters had stood between the two
                  families up to the period of the present history.</p>
               <p>Charles Mordant, notwithstanding he had received a considerable addition to his
                  allowance from his father, in consequence of the pleading of his mother in his
                  behalf, still found that his expenses far outstripped his income, and he at length
                  came to the resolution to endeavor to raise some money upon the security of his
                  future expectations. With this object in view he called upon a lawyer, who had
                  done some rather dirty<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7191-00000041"/> work for him two
                  or three times before, and asked his advice how to proceed, guaranteeing him an
                  ample remuneration, if he would procure him an advance of money.</p>
               <p>By the suggestion of this crafty limb of the law, he managed to procure a copy of
                  his father's will, informing him also of all the circumstances that he was
                  acquainted with relative to his father's affairs. The lawyer promised to consider
                  the matter, and desired the young man to call again in a day or two, and he
                  probably by that time might be able to assist him. This the youth agreed to, and
                  at the appointed time be waited upon the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"You see, I am true to appointment, Mr. Harvey," said he, gaily. "What can you do
                  for me now, old fellow; come, let's hear what you have resolved upon?"</p>
               <p>"I think I may be able to raise some money, Mr. Charles," said the lawyer, "but
                  there is one thing I wish to ask you about; that little property in New Jersey?
                  Are you sure that belongs to your respected parent, or does he only hold it on
                  trust?"</p>
               <p>"I am sure he claims it as his own and receives the rents. I have often heard him
                  chuckle over the rapid increase in its value. Why, Harvey, ten years ago, when my
                  father purchased it, it did not fetch $300 a year. Now, it's worth a cool
                  $1,000."</p>
               <p>"Humph! Of whom did your respected father purchase this little property, sir, may
                  I ask? I thought it once belonged to Mr. Miller?"</p>
               <p>"I fancy it did once; but there was some flaw or other in the title deeds, and it
                  fell into the hands of some Dutchman, and I believe my father purchased it at a
                  low rate from him—for the fellow was poor and ignorant; but I never bother my head
                  about these matters. What have you done old fellow towards raising the wind; you
                  know there will be plenty of money by and by to make all fair and square
                  again."</p>
               <p>"I have done little as yet," replied the lawyer. "You see, Mr. Charles, your
                  respected father may live a long time yet, and it is difficult just now to raise
                  money; but call on Monday, young sir, and I will see what I can do; yes, I will
                  see what I can do."</p>
               <p>Charles Mordant left the office, inwardly cursing the plodding notions of the
                  crusty old lawyer, still believing that when he called again something
                  satisfactory would be effected; "For," said he to himself, "I see plainly enough
                  the old codger only wants me to come out with better offers to himself for the
                  share he may take in the matter."</p>
               <p>No sooner, however, had the young man reached the street, than the lawyer, who had
                  sat for some moments engrossed in thought, started up, and exclaimed, "A pretty
                  piece of information you have let me into the secret of, Master Charles. Procure
                  money for you, indeed. No, by my faith; but I'll make the old man plank down
                  handsomely to me, or else, by God, I'll spring a mine beneath his feet that he
                  little dreams of."</p>
               <p>Charles Mordant, on quitting the office of the lawyer, proceeded to his father's
                  counting-house to arrange some business with the old man. Mrs. Miller happened to
                  be there, and Charles saw her for the first time since her daughter's
                  disappearance. She held out her hand to him as he entered, and his attention was
                  immediately arrested by a ring she wore on the third finger.</p>
               <p>He let her hand fall from his grasp, and shuddered perceptibly. Both the widow and
                  his father inquired if he felt unwell.</p>
               <p>"No," said he; "it was merely a momentary qualm. I have been subject to such
                  attacks of late." And he seated himself, until the widow was about to leave, when,
                  to the astonishment of his father, and, indeed, of the widow herself, he offered
                  to escort her home. She declined, but he insisted, and they left the
                  counting-house together.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Miller," said he, in the course of conversation, "may I ask where you
                  obtained that ring with the remarkable stone in the centre? I never saw but one
                  resembling it before, and then it was on the finger of an intimate friend. Excuse
                  me for the seeming rudeness of the question, but the ring attracted my notice the
                  moment I saw it."</p>
               <p>"Alas!" replied the widow, "I fear that the ring is the only memento of the kind I
                  have left of my poor, unfortunate Jane."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me for recalling such painful recollections," said the young man. "Had I
                  known the circumstances, I would not have asked the question."</p>
               <p>He left the widow on board the Jersey ferry-boat, and walked towards the family
                  residence.</p>
               <p>"Good Heavens!" said he, half aloud, after he had walked for some minutes, deeply
                  absorbed in thought; "can it be possible that there are two rings of such very
                  peculiar appearance?<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7191-00000042"/> It may be, nay, it
                  must be, the case. I am a fool to trouble myself about the matter."</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Which introduces the reader to Zuleika's abode on the Island of
                     Annabon—Interview between Captain Seymour, King Kettle, and the Loango

               </argument>
               <p>IN the preceding chapter we left Henry Davis in the presence of the beautiful
                  original of the portrait that had so fascinated his gaze in the cabin, of the
                  occasion of his taking up the locket from off the sofa.</p>
               <p>"What a charming present! How handsome it is! How like my husband! It was what I
                  wished to possess when I last parted from him. How kind of him to think of me when
                  he is so far, oh, so very far away," exclaimed the lady, in Spanish, as she gazed
                  with admiration upon the beautifully executed miniature.</p>
               <p>Harry did not understand her (although he had, through hearing some of the sailors
                  who spoke Spanish, occasionally talking to each other in that language, became
                  sufficiently familiar with several expressions to gather the meaning of her words,
                  especially when coupled with the animated expression of her features), had he
                  really heard her speak; but a fit of abstraction, such as he had experienced in
                  the cabin on the occasion above alluded to, had again seized the boy, and he stood
                  still as a statue, gazing earnestly upon the young girl, who, although she called
                  Captain Seymour her husband, could not have numbered more than sixteen summers. On
                  her part, the lady was so occupied with the picture that she seemed to have
                  forgotten the presence of the youth; both were completely occupied with their own
                  thoughts, when Captain Seymour, having completed his search in the carpet bag,
                  re-entered the apartment, bearing several other costly trinkets in his hands.</p>
               <p>He stood for some moments, looking at the boy and at the young female, and then he
                  gave way to a peal of laughter, which rung merrily through the room.</p>
               <p>"Oh Harry, Harry," said he at last, "I see you are not inclined to take my
                  warning. I shall positively become jealous. Why, I declare the boy is blushing
                  like a girl," he continued, as Harry, recalled to himself by the captain's voice,
                  reddened through his clear olive skin to the color of crimson. "But I need not be
                  jealous of thee, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">mi tesora</foreign>" added he, seating
                  himself on the sofa beside the girl, and fondly placing his arm around her waist,
                  and addressing her in words of endearment, as he placed gift after gift in her
                  lap.</p>
               <p>"You can go and amuse yourself in the garden, Harry," he said to the boy, who left
                  the room, still moving as if mechanically, scarcely seeming to know what he was
                  doing.</p>
               <p>"What a handsome boy," said the young girl, after Harry had gone out and closed
                  the door.</p>
               <p>"Yes, the boy is good looking enough—pretty enough for a girl, Zuleika."</p>
               <p>"And you will remain a long time with me? It is <emph>so</emph> long since I have
                  seen you, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">caro mio,</foreign>" murmured the girl, after
                  some conversation had passed between her and Seymour.</p>
               <p>"Nay, dearest, not long—willingly would I stay with you altogether; but I cannot.
                  I hope the day will come when we shall reside constantly together; two or three
                  more voyages, and then I shall quit the sea, and nothing but death shall separate
                  us."</p>
               <p>The countenance of the young female assumed a melancholy aspect, as she
                  replied—</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am very sad, dear George, when you are absent from me, and so long absent.
                  I have nobody here to speak to—nobody but the negroes; they are kind; I love them;
                  but I cannot be happy when you are away from me."</p>
               <p>"And yet this is a pretty spot, and you have your guitar and your books, and
                  everything to make you happy, Zuleika?"</p>
               <p>"Every thing but you, dearest; and were you here always, I could well sacrifice
                  all the rest."</p>
               <p>There was such a tone of gentleness and sadness in the young girl's voice, such an
                  expression of childlike, trustful, and confiding love in her large, soft, dark
                  eyes, as she gazed up in the captain's face, and nestled close to him, as though
                  she feared that he would even now slip away from her, or as if she could still
                  scarcely realize the happiness that his visit had brought to her heart, that it
                  was no wonder that Captain Seymour caught her in his arms and covered her with
                  caresses, and gazed upon her with a look of fondness—such as a father would bestow
                  upon a child, mingled with the intense affection of a husband—a lover still.</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7191-00000043"/>
               <p>"A week I shall be with you, dearest," he said; "for one week we will talk and
                  think of nothing but love; we will stroll together along the beach at sunset, and
                  listen to the murmur of the surf as it breaks amongst the rocks. We will walk in
                  the cool groves, and cull the fruits, and flowers at early morning, and at noonday
                  we will recline in the shade, and I will read to you, or you shall sing to me, and
                  I will accompany you upon the guitar. Yes, for one week we will forget that there
                  is any trouble or misery in the world. Our world shall be this lovely paradise,
                  and you shall be my Eve, and we the only inhabitants of this, our own Garden of
                  Eden. We shall be all in all to each other."</p>
               <p>The girl smiled, and pressed the hand of the captain, and again looked up into his
                  face, with her gentle, confiding look; but a shade of sadness again covered her
                  brow, as she asked:</p>
               <p>"And is there, then, so much misery in the outer world? and do you share it? This
                  island is almost all the world I can recollect. Ah! you are sad when you are away
                  from <emph>me.</emph> Bur, surely, <emph>you</emph> have no troubles?
                     <emph>You</emph> know no wretchedness?"</p>
               <p>A pang shot through the bosom of Seymour, as he listened to the innocent, artless
                  expression of the lovely girl.</p>
               <p>"And have <emph>you</emph> known no misery during your short life, my Zuleika?" he
                  asked; "have you, indeed, no recollection of other scenes than this? No: I forget;
                  poor child! you were too young to have had more than an indistinct recollection.
                  Do you recollect nothing of your father? of your mother, Zuleika? Nothing of the
                  days when you were a child, like yonder <emph>picaninee?</emph>" pointing to a
                  little negro child who was amusing herself by throwing pieces of stick into a
                  rivulet that trickled beneath the window of the apartment where they were
                  sitting.</p>
               <p>Tears came into the eyes of the young girl, as she replied, still smiling through
                  the tears:</p>
               <p>"Little, very little. Sometimes I think I do; but all seems lost in mist, as
                  though it were a dream. You, my husband, have been my father—my brother—I never
                  knew my mother—"</p>
               <p>"And never need care to have known her," replied Seymour, in English, speaking as
                  it were to himself. "A tigress loves and will protect its young. Men and women
                  only, are such demons as to cast asunder and trample on the ties of nature."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Que dijo el, senor?</foreign>" said the young girl,
                  archly. "You must teach me that English language which you say your countrymen
                  speak."</p>
               <p>"By-and-bye, when we live always together, Zuleika, I will teach it to you,"
                  replied Seymour. Then he continued in a more lively tone, "So you saw my flag when
                  the Albatross sailed past the island the other day. I saw the white flag flying in
                  answer to my signal It gladdened me, but it was almost more than I expected,
                  Zuleika. Were you looking out for me? You could hardly think I should pass on that
                  particular day?"</p>
               <p>"Do I not look out for you every day when you are absent?" replied the girl. "My
                  first walk in the morning is to the summit of yonder eminence where the flag-staff
                  stands; my last walk in the evening is to the same spot. How many days do I wait
                  with disappointment! How long I watch and wait! Oh, George, you have provided
                  everything here to make me happy; but I am very—very lonely."</p>
               <p>"Poor child!" murmured Seymour.</p>
               <p>"Can I not sail with you in your ship, if you must still go those long voyages to
                  sea?" asked the girl. "I have read in the books you have brought me of women who
                  sailed with their husbands and shared all their dangers."</p>
               <p>"My ship would be no place for you, nor such as you" answered Seymour, moodily;
                  "but are you indeed so very lonely? Well, I must leave you in a week; but before I
                  go to America I will see you again." A sudden thought seemed to strike him.
                  "Zuleika," he continued, "I shall perhaps be a month or six weeks away. Shall I
                  leave you Harry for a companion. He will teach you that English language you wish
                  to learn, and will talk to you of that America that some day I will carry you to,
                  and about which you so much like to hear. I am wrong, poor child! to leave you
                  without any companions but these ignorant though trusty negroes. I will try and
                  get you a female companion when next I return here from America."</p>
               <p>The girl's eyes sparkled with joy. "I shall none the less long for you, dear
                  George," she said, "but that will be something new to amuse me;" and then she
                  laughed as merrily as a child (she was little more) as she continued, "but, Senor
                  I must teach Harry Spanish or Greek before I can learn English from him. You have
                  forgotten, Senor that he does not speak my language."</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7191-00000044"/>
               <p>"Oh, he will soon learn, and no doubt you will get along very well together,"
                  answered the captain, laughing. Harry is a good and trusty lad, and admires you
                  exceedingly, and I have no doubt will learn either Spanish or Greek from your
                  lips. I know it would riot take me long to learn the latter, if you were my
                  teacher, though now I have forgotten what little I once knew."</p>
               <p>Thus matters were planned. Captain Seymour was glad that he had thought of
                  something to relieve in some measure, the monotony of Zuleika's life, and the next
                  day he told Harry of the arrangement.</p>
               <p>The lad seemed pleased with the idea, though he hardly expressed any satisfaction
                  beyond a mere acquiescence in the arrangement.</p>
               <p>Captain Seymour remained a week on the island; his boat's crew enjoying themselves
                  and making the most of the holiday, for it was little they saw of their captain,
                  whose whole time was engrossed by Zuleika; but, at the expiration of that period,
                  the pinnace was got ready to return to the coast, and the captain bade Zuleika a
                  tender, although brief, farewell, reiterating his promise to return in a month or
                  six weeks at the farthest; and leaving Harry, according to arrangement, to bear
                  the young girl company until his return.</p>
               <p>A few days after this, we again find Captain Seymour on board the Albatross in
                  Majumba Bay. During his brief absence every preparation had been made for the
                  reception of the slaves—the coopers had been employed in forming the bundles of
                  shakings into water-casks, and a portion of the crew were still engaged in filling
                  the new casks with water, a task of no slight difficulty, since the boats had to
                  toil several miles up the river before the water could be procured sufficiently
                  fresh and pure. Other gangs of sailors, assisted by natives, were busied taking in
                  stores of Indian corn, plantains, and sweet potatoes; in fact, everybody was as
                  busy as possible. As yet, but a small portion of the expected slaves had arrived,
                  and these had been so hardly driven from the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >depot</foreign> at Quaddah, that it was found impossible to take them on board
                  until they had been allowed some days to recruit their exhausted strength, to
                  anoint and bathe their blistered feet and skins, and to heal the sores made by the
                  lashes of the slave-drivers. They were of all ages and both sexes; but,
                  altogether, such a sorry-looking set, that Captain Seymour remonstrated sharply
                  with King Kettle, assuring him that if the remaining portion were not in better
                  condition, he should refuse to take them on board. He resolved to go himself to
                  Quaddah, and ascertain the number and condition of the slaves said to be in
                  readiness for him; but, previously, he made a selection amongst those who had
                  arrived, of such as he deemed capable of making the voyage, resolving to leave the
                  remainder (ineligibles) on King Kettle's hands. There were about a hundred in all,
                  and of these at least one-third were aged persons, whom the captain at once and
                  firmly rejected, despite the remonstrances of the chiefs, who said that they had
                  been at great expense in procuring them as they were, and that they would be
                  useless to them, as they were only fit to "eat rice and plantain—very mooch—and to
                  sleep."</p>
               <p>"And what matters that to me?" asked the captain. "Do you suppose I want a parcel
                  of useless cattle, only fit as you say yourself to 'eat rice very much.' No, no,
                  Kettle—and you too, Gumbo;" addressing the chief next in rank, "I must have a
                  better set than those, or else I shall weigh anchor and be off to Cabenda—and see
                  what King Jacko has got to dispose of."</p>
               <p>"King Jacko—very much bad man, cheat too much—no makee good bargain—never mind,
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">es todos,</foreign>" replied King Kettle.</p>
               <p>"Very well, then, see that you don't cheat me. I shall start for Quaddah
                  to-morrow; meanwhile, see if you can't bring this lot round a little; allow them
                  exercise—give them plenty of rice, and let them bathe every day—by that means they
                  may be rendered worth something. You must give the children to some of your own
                  women to nurse till the mothers get strong—as to the batch of old ones there, you
                  must dispose of them as you best can. I shall have nothing to do with them. We
                  shall have to throw quite enough overboard before we get to Cuba, under any
                  circumstances; the Albatross can't be burdened with such a lot of superannuated
                  carrion."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Tambien. Entiendo</foreign>" replied King Kettle, who saw
                  that it was useless to remonstrate.</p>
               <p>The pinnace was again got in readiness, this time to ascend the river, and taking
                  Mr. Tolcroft and a dozen men with him, the captain took his departure on the
                  following morning. The land on the coast from Loando to Majumba, although very
                  fertile, is flat and swampy—the river, one of the branches of the Zaire, running
                  for several miles through a similarly flat, but tolerably well cultivated country.
                  At intervals there were groups of the wine palm tree and the lofty boabid, and
                     groves<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7191-00000045"/> of limes, papaws and plantains;
                  but the land is mainly occupied with fields of Indian corn, beans, cabbages, and
                  manioc—amongst which are scattered, at distant intervals, native huts grouped two
                  or three together within the customary corn fence, reaching about ten feet high
                  and keeping the occupants sheltered from the sun; while the uncultivated parts,
                  which, in the most fertile districts are covered with tall rank grass, afford
                  shelter, to a variety of wild beasts—amongst which there are numerous Hans, and to
                  myriads of poisonous reptiles. There was nothing therefore, to obstruct the view
                  of the bay for several miles above the mouth of the river.</p>
               <p>The river is of tolerable width but is so overspread with rank weeds and trunks of
                  fallen trees that the progress of a boat is necessarily slow, and though the wind
                  blew fresh from off the sea, and all sail was set on the pinnace, the men had
                  enough to do with their oars and poles and boat-hooks, to keep the course clear of
                  the numerous obstacles. In some places, even where the river was more than forty
                  feet in width between the banks, the rank herbage had grown out, partially buoyed
                  up by the water, to a distance of ten or fifteen feet on either side, scarcely
                  leaving space for the boat to pass between it, and occasionally its progress was
                  facilitated by tugging it along by the branches.</p>
               <p>At length they came to a sharp bend, with low marshy banks, the marsh extending
                  almost to the sea shore, and giving them an uninterrupted view of the town and
                  coast, for although they had sailed and tugged several miles, the river was so
                  tortuous and winding, and the bend so abrupt and inclining to seaward, that they
                  were still but a short distance, comparatively, from the shore. Mr. Tolcroft was
                  at the helm and Captain Seymour was standing in the stern sheets looking towards
                  the coast and occasionally raising his spy-glass to his eye and scanning his ship
                  as she lay at anchor in the bay.</p>
               <p>"Hallo! what the mischief s up now?" exclaimed he, lowering his glass and
                  addressing the mate. "Give me the helm, and take the glass, Mr. Tolcroft; they
                  surely can't be putting the slaves on board already. Mr. Allan would never dare to
                  disobey my orders, and yet it appears to me that those three canoes are full of
                  black figures."</p>
               <p>The mate; thus addressed, gave the helm to his commander, and giving his
                  everlasting quid a roll between his teeth and his cheek, he raised the glass to
                  his eye and peered long and earnestly in the direction of the bay.</p>
               <p>"What do you make of it?" asked the captain.</p>
               <p>The mate lowered his glass, and chuckled in an under-tone, as though he were
                  laughing internally—the nearest approach to merriment he ever showed.</p>
               <p>"I guess Cap'n Seymour as King Kettle is <emph>expending</emph> the old puns,"
                  said he. "Yes, by gum! there go the woolly heads—one, two, three, four on 'em
                  overboard from the foremost canoe—and there goes a batch from the second one. They
                  eat very mooch rice," he added, "and so old Kettle thinks it just as well the
                  sharks should eat them afore they breeds a famine," and again he gave vent to the
                  peculiar chuckle until his frame appeared to shake with suppressed merriment.
                  "He's a 'tarnal old cuss, that Kettle, sure<emph>ly,</emph>" he exclaimed, as he
                  handed the spy-glass back to the captain, and again took the helm.</p>
               <p>The captain raised the glass again.</p>
               <p>"It is so, I declare," said he; "well, poor devils! It can't be helped—they'd come
                  to that at last, and the sooner, perhaps the better for themselves. By Jove! I
                  believe the whole twenty-five are overboard now, and he must have tied stones to
                  their legs, for they have all sunk—no, there are two black specks striking out for
                  the land, and the canoe is turned in chase of them; they must have got clear of
                  the weights attached to them. What will Kettle do now, I wonder?" He kept the
                  glass to his eye a minute longer, and then added—" By Heaven! the old scamp is
                  beating out their brains with the paddles—Faugh!" and with a slight shudder, he
                  lowered the glass and turned away his head.</p>
               <p>"Sich things can't be <emph>avided</emph> in our business," said Tolcroft, coolly;
                  "for my part, I'm used to sich sights now, and thinks nothin' on 'em."</p>
               <p>"Ugh!" exclaimed the captain, "I think nothing of blowing out a man's brains when
                  my blood is up, or in a fair fight; but I can't abide such sights as these."</p>
               <p>"You were allers too soft about them 'ere matters, Cap'n," responded Tolcroft.
                  "Lor bless you, I thinks nothin' on if; now—no more does most as has followed the
                  trade for any length of time. I sailed one voyage with Cap'n Junot; and tho' I
                  can't say much for the Frenchman's seamanship, or foe the disci<emph>pline</emph>
                  of his craft, I must give him the credit to gay, that he took them 'ere
                  indispensable matters as coolly as possible. It was quite a credit to his
                     <emph>fil</emph>osophy; for arter all, them niggers bean't o' the same flesh
                  and blood as other humans; and I doubt, for the matter o' that, if they be of the
                  same account, humanly speaking, as a good dog-more 'specially<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000046"/> cially a Newfunlan', or any o' them larger and more
                  val'able breeds."</p>
               <p>The captain did not reply to the philosophical argument of his mate; he had
                  probably not listened to it, or had forgotten all about the subject, for he had
                  seated himself in the stern sheets, and was deeply absorbed in thought. It took
                  the pinnace, with the utmost exertion on the part of the crew, nearly a week to
                  reach the town of Quaddah, which was a collection of several hundred negro huts,
                  and contained perhaps six or seven thousand inhabitants. It was in fact larger
                  than Loando, the sea-board capital of the country, and was a place of considerable
                  traffic with the natives of the interior, in consequence of its being the chief
                  depot of the slaves that were shipped to the Loango coast. The town contained,
                  besides the huts already mentioned, several long low huts of large dimensions,
                  which were appropriated to the free use of stranger merchants, who brought down
                  from the interior batches of slaves to dispose of to King Kettle and his
                  agents—and the slave depot was an immense hut of similar construction, surrounded
                  with a strong reed fence, over which gigantic negroes were posted as guards to
                  prevent the escape of the slaves, which, however, was scarcely possible, since all
                  but the children, or very aged persons, were manacled with tough green withes,
                  which in some instances were tied so tight as to cut deep into the flesh of the
                  unhappy captives; besides, they did not betray any signs of thinking of escape;
                  they seemed to have given themselves up to hopeless despair. Slaves to the number
                  of two hundred were here collected, and the <hi rend="i"/>mafooka, or governor of
                  the town, said that several hundred more were on their way from the interior.
                  Those collected, although less worn out with fatigue than the division which had
                  been driven by forced marches to Majumba, were of much the same class. They were
                  all entirely naked, and of all ages and both sexes. They were divided into gangs,
                  the owners of each gang having charge over their own property, which, on the
                  arrival of Captain Seymour, they brought out of the block-house and paraded for
                  sale. The countenances of each and all wore an expression of stolid indifference,
                  varied with regard to some by an expression of surprise at the novelty of their
                  situation. They all bore, more or less, the marks of ill-usage, their flesh being
                  covered with blue wales raised by the lash, which was carried in the hands of the
                  slave-dealers, and applied, as it seemed, for mere amusement, or from the force of
                  habit, and always in a knowing style, when it was necessary to show off the paces,
                  or to give proof of the activity of a particular slave, who had attracted the
                  notice of a dealer.</p>
               <p>One only amongst all the assembled group showed traces of emotion; she was weeping
                  bitterly, but silently, and had crouched into a corner of one of the block houses
                  with the object, apparently, of escaping notice, and of indulging in her
                  grief.</p>
               <p>"What's that young woman sitting weeping there in the corner?" said Captain
                  Seymour, addressing the slave dealer, through the medium of the <hi rend="i"
                  />Mafooka, who spoke a little Spanish.</p>
               <p>The reply was the sharp application of the whip to the naked body of the young
                  woman, the pain causing her to spring to her feet, shrinking with anguish.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with her? She is a handsome negress as ever I clapped eyes
                  upon," said the captain, repeating his question.</p>
               <p>"By gum! she's a spry looking lass," added Mr. Tolcroft.</p>
               <p>"She has lost her children, the slave dealer tells me," replied the <hi rend="i"
                  />Mafooka. "She come a long way from the interior, and had twin children at the
                  breast when Yoorga purchased her. He gave a good price for her to the chief of her
                  tribe, whose wife she was, and he was obliged to take the children, too, though
                  they were too young to be of any use to him. The chief would not have sold her,
                  only his principal wife was jealous of her charms. You see, senor Capitano, she is
                  a handsome girl, and her price was two muskets and a keg of rum, besides several
                  hands of tobacco."</p>
               <p>"And where are her children?" asked Seymour, in Spanish.</p>
               <p>"Senor Capitano demands to know where are the children of the <hi rend="i"
                  />bemba?" exclaimed the <hi rend="i"/>Mafooka to the slave dealer, who was a great
                  burly negro of the <hi rend="i"/>Yunga Jagos tribe, and who was armed with a heavy
                  thong of plaited buffalo hide.</p>
               <p>"Gone for food to the lions," replied the negro, playfully flourishing his whip
                  over the shrinking form of the female as he spoke. He then entered into a long
                  explanation with the <hi rend="i"/>Mafooka—which the latter subsequently
                  interpreted to the captain, from which it appeared that the woman had travelled
                  nearly a moon's journey, and had carried her children nearly the whole way. She
                  had caused the slave dealer a great deal of trouble, as her progress had
                  necessarily been impeded by the children, and sometimes a vigorous application of
                  the whip had been necessary—that it had been fully applied, the poor creature's<pb

                  for they were scarified with sores, some of them still bleeding. "But, she would
                  have died if the children had been taken from her," continued the negro. "At
                  length, passing through a cane-brake—a few days journey from Quaddah—two lions had
                  suddenly rushed from the the canes and stood glaring their fiery eyeballs at the
                  cavalcade; the negroes in charge succeeded in frightening off the animals, and
                  they fled to the cane-brake, but the woman and her children were in the rear, and
                  as they were emerging from the brake, I observed one of the fierce brutes creeping
                  along, apparently for the purpose of making a spring at the mother and her
                  infants.</p>
               <p>"I fired my musket at the beast," added the negro, "and though he was not hit, the
                  lion skulked into the cane-brake, and then I was angry with the woman and urged
                  her forward to join the rest of the gang; the children encumbered her. I had had
                  trouble enough with them. I struck her with the whip, and tore the infants from
                  her—throwing them into the path beside the cane-brake—and then dragged the mother
                  to the rest of the gang. She is weeping for her children—it is not uncommon—that's
                  all."</p>
               <p>Captain Seymour made arrangements for the purchase and transportation to Majumba,
                  of one hundred slaves, including among them the Yunga Jagos woman, and then
                  returned to the coast. The cargo arrived a few days after he had reached the port,
                  and the fresh arrivals were placed with those previously picked out from the lot
                  that King Kettle had brought down, until the day of the departure—it being
                  desirable that they should remain ashore as long as possible, so as to be in
                  pretty good condition when shipped.</p>
               <p>All promising to be in readiness in a fortnight, Captain Seymour prepared to pay
                  his promised second visit to the Island of Annabon, and to the fair recluse of
                  that beautiful Island, the lovely Zuleika. As, however, he was on the point of
                  setting out, a vessel was seen in the offing, which the captain soon recognized as
                  the Dolphin, Captain Junot. As she drew nearer, it was perceptible that she had
                  met with severe usage some way or other, for her top-gallant masts had been
                  carried away, and her progress was so impeded for want of sail, that she stood
                  very slowly into the bay. The pinnace was just under sail when the Dolphin was
                  espied, and Captain Seymour resolved to go on board of her and learn what ill luck
                  had befallen her.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WE will, in the present chapter, retrace our steps, going back indeed to a period
                  anterior to the date of the commencement of our story.</p>
               <p>Captain Seymour, at the period that he was first introduced to the reader, was a
                  young man of about six or seven and twenty years of age. We now propose to give a
                  brief history of his life, since such is necessary for the better comprehension of
                  our narrative. He was a native of one of the Southern States—Virginia, we
                  believe—but from his early childhood until he had passed his twentieth year, his
                  life had been spent in Europe. His father was an Englishman, who had left his
                  native land while still a mere child, the grandfather of Seymour having emigrated
                  to the United States; not urged thereto by poverty, or the hope of bettering his
                  condition by directing his energies in a field less stocked with laborers, as is
                  generally the case with emigrants, for he was a man of great wealth, and one who
                  boasted his descent from a noble English family, being no other than that of
                  Seymour, whose head was the well-known first proud Duke of Somerset.</p>
               <p>Hot-brained and headstrong; a man of desperate and unbridled passions, to the
                  indulgence of which his great wealth allowed free scope, he had entered the army
                  at an early period of life—as affording a fair field for the dashing, daring
                  energy of his character. There he had rapidly risen to the rank of Colonel; when,
                  satisfied with active service, at the age of thirty-five, he had married a young
                  lady every way his equal in birth and fortune, who bore him one son, the father of
                  our present hero. The poor lady was, however, sadly neglected by her dissolute
                  husband, and she died soon after she had given birth to her son; it was rumored at
                  the time that she died heart-broken, in consequence of her husband's cruelty and
                  neglect and her knowledge of his flagrant infidelity. He pursued his course of
                     extravagance<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7191-00000048"/> vagance and dissipation
                  unchecked, until his fortieth year, when he was detected in a scandalous intrigue
                  with the handsome wife of a former brother officer. The consequence was that he
                  received a challenge from the outraged husband, who fell mortally wounded at the
                  first shot from his vile antagonist. There were rumors at the time that foul play
                  had taken place, and that the ball had been abstracted from the pistol of the
                  Colonel's antagonist, he having bribed the officer's second, who was a creature of
                  his own. The truth was never known; nor is it a pleasant task to pry into such
                  histories as these; suffice it to say, that through the power of his own wealth
                  and the influence of his wealthy connections, the affair was hushed up, on the
                  condition, exacted on the part of his relatives, that he should expatriate
                  himself, and that all future relationship should on their part be disowned.</p>
               <p>This was a matter of little consequence to Colonel Seymour, who cared little for
                  family ties, so long as he had unbounded wealth at his command to enable him to
                  continue—he cared not where—the career of dissipation that had become habitual to
                  him. He converted his wealth into cash, and with the partner of his guilt, the
                  widow of the murdered officer, he came to America. Here he pursued a similar
                  course of life for several years, but he died prematurely old, shortly after his
                  guilty partner, leaving his son Alfred, the father of our hero, full and perfect
                  possession of his immense wealth; although his extravagance and his improvidence
                  and neglect to a still greater degree had sadly impaired it.</p>
               <p>Brought up under such instructors, it was no wonder that the son had inherited the
                  bad passions, and been trained to the indulgence of the same evil propensities, as
                  had marked his father. He, however, partially retrieved his character, by falling
                  in love with a beautiful and well-born French lady, who had come out from Paris to
                  reside with her guardian in Louisiana, and, after a brief courtship, he married
                  her, and soon after the birth of his son George—he, at his wife's request, went to
                  reside permanently in the city of Paris.</p>
               <p>There our hero was educated; and from his earliest youth, he displayed an aptitude
                  for study that promised one day to enable him to obtain a position of eminence;
                  for wealth to help him on, step by step, he apparently already possessed. He
                  possessed many of the unprincipled traits of his father's character; but these
                  were so softened down and kept in subjection by his mother, and her gentle
                  attributes were seemingly so blended in his disposition, that his more impetuous
                  passions only served to give a dashing, lively semblance to his
                  disposition—befitting a youth of good expectations, and of an exterior of
                  remarkable beauty and elegance. His father died when he was a mere child, leaving
                  his son the sole heir to his property on the death of his mother; subjected only,
                  should she die while he was still a minor, to the guardianship of such executors
                  as he should appoint. Madame Seymour was a woman of very delicate frame, and her
                  death occurred about three years after the decease of her husband, when George was
                  about fourteen years of age. She bequeathed her only beloved child to the care of
                  a lawyer in whom she had unbounded confidence, and who, since her husband's death,
                  had managed her affairs.</p>
               <p>George, at the period of this occurrence, was at school at Dijon, where he had
                  given promise already of great scholastic attainments. He was deeply grieved at
                  the death of his mother, to whom he was tenderly attached. He returned to Paris to
                  attend the funeral, and to submit himself to the regulations of his guardian,
                  Monsieur Dichet. He had always had an ample allowance from his mother, and
                  Monsieur Dichet, after the funeral had taken place, told him that he intended to
                  increase it considerably; that his mother had left him the heir of great wealth,
                  and that it was but right that he should enjoy it while he was young. He also took
                  every means to lead the impulsive lad into every sort of temptation; for,
                  notwithstanding the good opinion Madame Seymour had entertained of him, he was a
                  man utterly devoid of principle, and the last person she would have chosen, had
                  she known his real character, to be the guide and guardian of her beloved and
                  orphaned child. M. Dichet had his own ends to serve. We shall see how he carried
                  out his plans.</p>
               <p>George, eventually, after having been permitted to run loose amidst all the
                  profligacy of the most profligate capital in the world, at an age when he most
                  required the care of a vigilant preceptor and adviser, went back to school; but he
                  was no longer the careful, indefatigable student he had hitherto been. He could
                  not put up with the restraints of scholastic discipline; and now, having an
                  abundance of money at his disposal, he was able to purchase over plenty of
                  so-called friends, willing to encourage him in setting his tutors at defiance,
                  and, indeed, in undermining the principles of his fellow-students. Still, at
                  times, the recollections of his mother would recall him to his senses, and,
                  perhaps for weeks, he would devote himself to<pb n="90-91"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000049"/> study with as great an intensity as ever; but,
                  by-and-by, all would be forgotten again, and he would break out into greater
                  dissipations than before, until, at length, although on account of his evident
                  talents and his wealth, his preceptors looked upon his failings with much greater
                  leniency than they would have done upon those of his fellows.</p>
               <p>At last, his conduct became so outrageous—so devoid of all decency—that he was
                  formally expelled from the college. He wrote to his guardian, saying that he
                  should not return to Paris, for he intended to travel, and he desired a still
                  greater augmentation of his allowance. This was readily granted, and his conduct
                  even approved of by his rascally guardian, who wrote that it could not be expected
                  that a young man of such splendid expectations should confine himself to the
                  rigorous regulations of a college; and he promised to supply him with what funds
                  he required. In company, therefore, with one of the tutors of the college—a man of
                  depraved mind—who had watched (knowing his wealth) the reckless career of the
                  young man, and who had gained a considerable ascendancy over him, although, even
                  at this early age (he was but fifteen, although tall and manly enough in
                  appearance to pass for eighteen or twenty) George Seymour would submit himself to
                  no person's guidance, he started upon a tour through Germany, which was
                  subsequently extended into Turkey and Asia Minor.</p>
               <p>Had it not been for the companionship of the worthless tutor, George might still
                  have been saved, but he urged him on to every extravagance, and ridiculed anything
                  like a return to the path of rectitude.</p>
               <p>The very spirit of adventure, which the youth possessed, and which is always
                  allied to a certain nobility of soul, might, we repeat, have otherwise led him to
                  take delight in more ennobling pursuits than those he followed under the direction
                  of his vile companion.</p>
               <p>Thus two years passed away, George, during that period, having visited almost
                  every capital in Germany and Austria, and having penetrated into Turkey after
                  first crossing the Black Sea from Odessa to Trebizond, in Asia Minor, he resolved
                  to return to Paris by way of Constantinople and the the Mediterranean Sea. While
                  at Constantinople curiosity prompted him to visit the slave market, although the
                  common impression that there are there to be seen exposed to vulgar gaze the
                  beauties of Georgia, Circassia, or the Isles of Greece is erroneous, these being
                  only shown to Turks of rank and fortune, who, it is expected, have a desire to
                  purchase them for their own harems, or perchance, for the purpose of making an
                  acceptable gift to some superior. The majority of the slaves exposed openly in the
                  market are negroes and mulattoes of various shades, and the sight in reality
                  offers little novelty to any one who has witnessed the sale of negroes at New
                  Orleans, or any other Southern slave mart.</p>
               <p>Whilst, however, George Seymour and his travelling companion were strolling
                  through the streets, the attention of the former was arrested by the sight of a
                  beautiful child of seven or eight years of age, who was being led up and down the
                  slave market by a female of prepossessing appearance, but whose features were
                  marked by a ferocity of expression that showed her to be the slave of the most
                  unbridled passions. She was attired, as well as the child, in the dress of the
                  females of the Grecian Archipelago; and evidently, from the anxious glances she
                  cast at those who noticed the beauty of the child, she sought a purchaser for
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Good God I" exclaimed George Seymour to his companion, "can it be possible that
                  infant is for sale!"</p>
               <p>"No doubt of it," answered the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ci-devant</foreign> usher,
                  whose name was Jollette; "both the Greeks and the Circassians sell their children;
                  but this little creature is rather young—that is the reason she is publicly
                  exposed. Were she older you would not get the chance of seeing her, unless you
                  were favored by getting the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entree</foreign> into the
                  bagnios where the slaves destined for the harems of the grand seigneurs are kept,
                  secluded from the curiosity of the vulgar. <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >Pardieu!</foreign> Monsieur George, it is as difficult to get a glimpse of one
                  of these veiled beauties before they become inmates of the harem, as it is
                  afterwards."</p>
               <p>"She is a lovely little creature," exclaimed George, whose attention was so
                  earnestly fixed upon the child that he had paid little heed to what his companion
                  had said.</p>
               <p>"Yes, she is pretty enough—<foreign xml:lang="FRA">mais tres petite</foreign> a
                  mere child."</p>
               <p>"And the most beautiful child I have ever seen," responded George. "See what
                  hair—thick, soft, and long, and glossy as silk. It shines in the sun like threads
                  of gold—and what eyes, and eyebrows, and eyelashes!"</p>
               <p>"And what a smooth forehead, and what a straight Grecian nose, and what a round,
                  finely moulded chin, and fair, pure complexion," said M. Jollette, laughing. "You
                  see, George, I can admire the points of female beauty as well as you; but,
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma foi!</foreign> it is so much admiration thrown away
                  upon one so<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7191-00000050"/> young. <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">Parbleu!</foreign> If you could only get admission into yonder
                  bagnio now—or were this damsel eighteen instead of eight years of age, it would be
                  another matter"—</p>
               <p>While this conversation had been going on, the object of the youth's admiration
                  had been gazing about her with an expression of bewildered delight at the novelty
                  of her situation, apparently quite unconcerned—probably ignorant of the fate to
                  which she was evidently destined.</p>
               <p>The female who had her in charge, however, had noticed the admiration that shone
                  in the ardent gaze of the younger of the Frank strangers, and she addressed him in
                  a Greek patois, which, with the knowledge of the Greek language he had acquired at
                  school, and which was still fresh in his memory, aided by the practice he had had
                  in the various dialects during the last six months of his travels, young Seymour
                  could, with some little difficulty, manage to comprehend.</p>
               <p>"Would the Frank milord buy the child?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"What does the woman say, George?" inquired M. Jollette, whose attention had been
                  elsewhere directed, but who had heard the woman's voice.</p>
               <p>"As well as I can make out, she asks if I will buy the child," replied George.</p>
               <p>Ha, ha, ha!" laughed M. Jollette. "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mon dieu! c'est drole
                     ca!</foreign> A precious bargain you would have, my friend. If, as I said, the
                  girl were eighteen, now, there would be some sense in it; but, <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">Parbleu!</foreign> even then, you could not carry her to
                  Paris."</p>
               <p>Not heeding the badinage of his companion, George had entered into a broken
                  conversation with the woman.</p>
               <p>"Is the child your own?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Mine to sell, monsieur," replied the woman.</p>
               <p>"But is she your daughter—your own child?"</p>
               <p>The woman smiled, but did not reply.</p>
               <p>"Where do you come from?"</p>
               <p>"From Scio, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">Signor</foreign>" said the woman, altering the
                  title she gave the querist at each reply—sometimes giving the French, sometimes
                  the Italian, and sometimes the Spanish title of respect.</p>
               <p>"Are you a native of that Island?"</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Si, Senor.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"And the child also?"</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Si, Excellenza.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"What are you talking about, George?" interposed M. Jollette lette; "you will
                  cause the woman to believe that you wish to purchase the child.</p>
               <p>"And if I do?"</p>
               <p>"Then I think you will be a great fool," replied M. Jollette.</p>
               <p>"M. Jollette," said George, sternly, "I would thank you not to address such
                  language to me again, or we part company. I will allow no one to address me in
                  that manner."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Pardon, Monsieur George,</foreign>" replied the
                  Frenchman; "it was a slip of the tongue; I meant no harm. You are too hasty. Have
                  your own way."</p>
               <p>"I mean to have it," answered George, curtly, as he proceeded again to question
                  the woman—</p>
               <p>"And you really wish to sell this pretty child?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Really, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Monsieur!</foreign> have I not already told your
                  excellency?"</p>
               <p>"And how much do you ask for her?"</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Monsieur?</foreign>" exclaimed the woman, apparently not
                  comprehending the question.</p>
               <p>"The price. How many piastres? I ask the price of the child."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes; <emph>Milord</emph> is rich, and the child is very beautiful I demand
                  one thousand piastres."</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh!" replied George, turning away; "you ask the price of a beauty old
                  enough to become the inmate of a harem."</p>
               <p>The woman feared that he was about to leave, and she hastily repeated—</p>
               <p>"The child is very beautiful. I will take eight hundred piastres."</p>
               <p>"If I were certain that you were the mother of the infant, and had the right to
                  dispose of her, I would purchase her," replied Seymour. "Who and what are you?" he
                  continued, "and by what right do you dispose of her?"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>am</emph> her mother, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Excellenza.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Good God! is it possible, woman?" exclaimed Seymour. "You a mother, and sell your
                  own child, and such a beautiful child as this!"</p>
               <p>"I am very poor, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor,</foreign> and my husband compels
                  me."</p>
               <p>"Have you other children?" asked the young man, scarcely able to control his
                  indignation.</p>
               <p>"I have a son at Scio; I have another daughter."</p>
               <p>"And she is dead?"</p>
               <p>"I have sold her, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Excellenza</foreign>—she was very
                  beautiful, more<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7191-00000051"/> beautiful than this
                  child. She is in the seraglio of the Sultan Mahmoud." [This occurrence took place,
                  it must be borne in mind, prior to the death of the Sultan Mahmoud, father of the
                  present Sultan Mahmoud, father of the present Sultan, Abd-el-Medjid.]</p>
               <p>"I will not purchase a child from its mother," said the young man, indignantly
                  turning away.</p>
               <p>"As your excellency pleases," replied the woman. "The child is beautiful; she will
                  find a purchaser."</p>
               <p>At this moment the little girl, who had been, apparently unconsciously, listening
                  to this conversation, but who had been, evidently, pleased with the admiration
                  with which Seymour regarded her, smiled innocently, and placed her hand in his.
                  This smile and the simple act of childish confidence, decided Seymour.</p>
               <p>"Woman, I will buy the girl," said he; "follow me to the caravansera, and I will
                  give you the money," He took the hand of the child and led her through the street,
                  heedless of the sneers of Jolette and the wondering gaze of numerous
                  spectators.</p>
               <p>"Would you like to come and live with me?" he asked the child, as plainly as he
                  could, addressing her in her native patois</p>
               <p>"You will be kind to me?" said she, inquiringly, yet still confidingly.</p>
               <p>"Very kind. I shall love you very much. Shall you not be very sorry to leave your
                  mother?"</p>
               <p>"Zoe beats me," replied the child.</p>
               <p>"But she is your mother?" inquired Seymour; "shall you not be sorry to leave
                  her?"</p>
               <p>"She makes me call her Zoe, not mother. I shall like to live with you. You will be
                  kind to me."</p>
               <p>"Indeed I will," answered Seymour.</p>
               <p>At this moment they arrived at the Turkish Inn, or caravansera; and the money was
                  paid over to the woman who had said she was the mother of the little girl, and she
                  became the property of George Seymour. Whether or not Zoe, as the child called
                  her, was really her mother, George never learnt. He made further inquiries after
                  her on the following day, but she had gone, immediately after she had received the
                  money, on board a Greek felucca, which was on the point of sailing for Scio—and he
                  never saw her again.</p>
               <p>It retired all George's determination to control the ridicule with which Jollette
                  would have assailed him had he dared; but his youthful companion had already
                  obtained a complete mastery over him, and Jollette contented himself with laughing
                  in his sleeve at what he considered the insane folly of his companion.</p>
               <p>"What is your name, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma petite?</foreign>" asked George of
                  the child, after he had carried her into his own apartment in the caravansera.</p>
               <p>"They call me Bedetta," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"And I shall call you Zuleika henceforward," answered George, "you will recollect
                  that—you are <emph>my</emph> Zuleika."</p>
               <p>"Yes—it is a pretty name," said the child, gazing trustingly in her new
                  protector's face.</p>
               <p>"Why have you chosen that name, George?" asked Jollette.</p>
               <p>"Because I fancy it," he replied—"because Byron's Zuleika was always a favorite
                  heroine of mine, and because I fancy this little girl is like her."</p>
               <p>"To-morrow we quit Constantinople for Naples," said Jollette after a pause.</p>
               <p>"Yes, to-morrow—I have got our permits ready."</p>
               <p>"And what do you intend to do with little Bedetta—Zuleika, I mean?"</p>
               <p>"Take her with me."</p>
               <p>"And then?"</p>
               <p>"Carry her with me to France."</p>
               <p>Jollette did not reply, but he opened his eyes very wide and shrugged his
                  shoulders.</p>
               <p>At length he ventured to ask—</p>
               <p>"And your future intentions regarding her—are?"</p>
               <p>"To have her educated, and when she is old enough to marry, to make her my wife.
                  It is a whim I have taken into my head."</p>
               <p>"And as foolish a whim as ever man determined upon," muttered Jollette to himself,
                  inaudibly, "we shall see what it comes to."</p>
               <p>On the following day, George Seymour and Jollette—the former with Zuleika, as we
                  shall now call her, under his care—sailed for Naples, and having remained there
                  for a few weeks, again sailed for Carthagena in Spain, Seymour having resolved to
                  make the tour of the Spanish Continent before he returned to Paris.</p>
               <p>Finding, however, that it was difficult to travel with the child, he placed her in
                  a convent at Grenada, for the purpose of being educated, leaving ample funds in
                  the hands of one of the sisters<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7191-00000052"/> for
                  present purposes, and promising to return within a year and renew his payment and
                  ascertain what progress the child had made.</p>
               <p>Thus far, all had been <foreign xml:lang="FRA">couleur de rose</foreign> in
                  Seymour's life, but now he was doomed to suffer a sad reverse of fortune. On his
                  arrival at Madrid, he had expected to have received remittances from France, but
                  he found none, and having expended all his available funds for the child's
                  education, he was put to great inconvenience. He, however, wrote to Paris, and
                  awaited a reply at Madrid. It came at last, but not in the form he had
                  anticipated.</p>
               <p>The letter came from his late mother's banker at Paris. It informed the young man
                  that Monsieur Dichet had failed in business, under circumstances of a dishonorable
                  nature, and had absconded, no one knew whither, deeply in debt, and having
                  withdrawn from the bank, some time before his embarrassed circumstances became
                  known, the whole of the large property he had in trust for George Seymour. The
                  young man perused the letter with dismay. A moment before, he had imagined himself
                  to be the possessor of immense wealth; now he was ruined, by the villainy of one
                  in whose faith he had implicitly trusted. He was, in fact, a pauper in a strange
                  land.</p>
               <p>He kept his own apartment, perfectly stupefied by the contents of the letter,
                  during the whole of that day. On the following morning he resolved to seek advice
                  of M. Jollette. He was not to be found. Upon inquiry, he learnt that he had
                  received a letter from Paris on the preceding day, and had immediately set out for
                  Prance. George soon found that this infamous man had not only quitted him in his
                  hour of misfortune, but had robbed him to a large amount. He had carried off with
                  him a trunk containing ail the most valuable of George's personal effects and the
                  little cash that he still had in his possession. George was thunderstruck,
                  stupefied, when he contemplated the perfidy of this villain; but the heaviest blow
                  had already fallen upon the victim, and now he bore the second, which a few hours
                  before would have almost prostrated his energies, with comparative stoicism. He
                  soon recovered from the temporary stupefaction which the desertion of his
                  companion had caused, and his eye lighted upon a letter on the mantel shelf of the
                  apartment. It was directed to him; he opened and read it. It ran as follows:</p>
               <q>

                     <body>

                           <p>"GEORGE SEYMOUR:—I have borne long enough with your patronage—and
                              while you were wealthy have put up with the scorn and contumely with
                              which you have treated me. Now, I have learnt you are penniless. Think
                              not that you have a friend in me. I used you—<emph>I,</emph> whom you
                              despised, as a tool to suit my own purposes; You are useful to me no

               </q>
               <p>This was sufficient to satisfy the betrayed youth that his companion, Jollette,
                  was a relative of his late infamous guardian, and had been employed by M. Dichet
                  for the furtherance of his own purposes. He had been amply supplied with money, in
                  order to blind his eyes to the duplicity of his guardian and his travelling
                  companion, and he had fallen into the snare.</p>
               <p>George Seymour was not one to fall into the depths of despair upon learning the
                  falsity of his supposed friends. Be did not tear his hair, or rend his garments,
                  or give himself up to sorrow; but he recorded a vow (falling into the other
                  extreme, and thinking that because those whom he had trusted had deceived him, all
                  men were deceitful), that his hand should thenceforth fee raised against every
                  man—that he would thenceforth have no compunction—that his own interests should be
                  paramount to any other consideration—that neither man nor woman should thereafter
                  stand in the way of the gratification of his will. One only reservation he made.
                  It was in favor of the little Scio girl whom he had purchased. Her he vowed to
                  love, protect, and cherish. She was, like himself, cast off—betrayed by her
                  natural protector—there was common cause between them—and while he lived he
                  resolved that she should not want-should know no sorrow—should be in the receipt
                  of every gratification it lay in his power to bestow.</p>
               <p>The remaining portion of George Seymour's career, until the period in which he was
                  introduced to the reader, was quite as singular, though in a different way, to
                  that which had preceded it.</p>
               <p>He raised money by the sale of his watch and jewels to reach Paris. There arrived,
                  he sought out the banker, and learnt from him the utter hopelessness of his
                  affairs. In him, however, he found a friend. He possessed considerable literary
                  talent, and obtained, through the banker, a situation on one of the leading
                  journals of the capital. In a short time his articles created great sensation, and
                  he seemed on the high road<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7191-00000053"/> to fame and
                  fortune—for successful journalism is, in France, a guarantee of fame—but his
                  notions were too republican—too democratic, to suit the court of Louis Phillippe;
                  and the writer was discovered, fined, and imprisoned. While in jail he, renewed
                  his vows of hatred and scorn towards mankind, and upon his release, heedless of
                  the future, he resolved; to put his theory into practice. He joined a band of
                  robbers in the passes of the Apennines, and remained with them six months, until
                  the band was dispersed by <foreign xml:lang="FRA">gendarmes.</foreign> He escaped
                  (though several Were captured), and wandered through Switzerland and Italy, living
                  upon the booty he had saved. Arrived at Otranto, searcely daring whither wag his
                  destination, and his, funds failing, he joined a Greek vessel that was about
                  sailing from that out of the way port altogether heedless of her character. She
                  proved to be a piratical crafty and in her hb cruised for months, distinguishing
                  himself, amongst his cruel comrades, by his Superior ferocity. Still amidst all
                  this, one humanizing influence prevailed; it was the thought of the; little
                  Zuleika whom he had left at Grenada.</p>
               <p>Amidst all his difficulties he had managed to transmit to the superior of the
                  convent from time to time, sufficient for her maintenance and education, though,
                  since he had placed her there he had never visited her. At last the pirate's
                  strong-told in the Greek seas was, broken up, and with a considerable amount of
                  property in his possession, which he turned in to money he sought the land of his
                  birth, without a thought of his future career. He arrived at Charleston, and was
                  persuaded by a sea captain, whom he fell in with, to take a trip to sea with him.
                  The vessel proved to have been secretly fitted out as a slaver, and on board of
                  her, nothing loth, George Seymour was initiated into the mysteries of the infamous
                  traffic in slaves on the African coast.</p>
               <p>On his return he was introduced to Mr. Mordant. His gentlemanly manners, and his
                  apparently unscrupulous principles, satisfied the merchant that he was a person
                  who would suit him, and he was forthwith installed as captain of one of his
                  vessels, secretly engaged in conveying slaves from the coast of Africa, and
                  disposing of them in Cuba and on the Brazilian coast.</p>
               <p>At this period George Seymour had only just attained his twenty-first year,
                  although his habits of life had made him seem older. On his first voyage he boldly
                  ran into Gibraltar with false papers, and leaving his ship, brought the young girl
                  Zuleika from Grenada, and hired a governess as companion to accompany her. The
                  pretty child he now found giving every promise of becoming a most beautiful woman.
                  She was transported with delight on again beholding her protector and he took her
                  with him to Sierra Leone. There he made a purchase from a Portuguese merchant of a
                  considerable lot of land in the lovely but almost unsettled island of Annabon upon
                  which he paused a handsome cottage to be erected, and there he placed Zuleika,
                  still under the tuition of her governess. During five years he visited her there
                  as often as he could which, however, was but seldom but he lavished freely upon
                  her, and upon her abode, the money he gained by his nefarious profession. At the
                  end of this period, when the girl was in her fifteenth year the governess died,
                  and was buried on the island, and Seymour, who was on a visit to Annabon at the
                  time, secured the services of a Portuguese padre, and married the young and
                  beautiful; girl. Thus Zuleika became the slave captain's bride, well educated, yet
                  ignorant, poor child, of all the conventionalities of life and all the more loved
                  by Seymour in consequence of this artlessness. Such was Zuleika at the period at
                  which she was introduced to the reader.</p>
               <p>We have giver a sufficient insight into the character of Seymour to show that he
                  was in many respects a man of heartless, unprincipled disposition; but,
                  notwithstanding his many failings, he was ever true to his love for the innocent
                  being whom he had taken muter his: protection, and whom he loved with a
                  passionate, all-passing affection.</p>

                  /> been notorious for the fatality of its climate to European constitutions; yet
                  it abounds with scenery of the most delightful and sometimes of the most romantic
                  character; nowhere has nature been so lavish of her gifts—nowhere has vegetation
                  revelled so wildly in the extravagance of luxuriance: for here she know no period
                  of torpidity; she know decay, it is true—for every earthly thing; animate or
                  inanimate, must wither and perish; but she needs no resting space to recover her
                  vitality; the full-blown leaves fall off—the matured herbage perishes; but the
                  germ of new life has already been sown,; add it Almost immediately springs into
                  maturity; Were this beautiful country cleared of its rank and superabundant
                  vegetation, which, falling to the earth, ere yet it is entirely withered; or its
                  moisture evaporated through the pressure fend rapid growth of young and healthy
                  shoots, loads the soil with decomposing vegetable matter, breeding malaria in its
                  most noxious and fatal form—were the soil drained and improved by thwarts of
                  civilization, it would be, we truly believe, one of the most salubrious, as it is
                  now one of the most enchanting portions of the globe. Poor, benighted Africa! In
                  all things Allowed to run waste—its people debased; its soil neglected; its
                  resources unknown! its interior unexplored; Will it ever occupy the position that
                  its situation and extent over the earth's surface, its mineral and agricultural
                  wealth, and its commercial promise should claim for it? Will the ban of the
                  patriarch pronounced against its children never be removed; or will it ever
                  remain, as it now is, the only portion of the habitable globe into which the light
                  of science and the spirit of Adventure has not penetrated? A mystery enshrouds the
                  depths f of its dark forests, and the unknown extent of its vast deserts. Its
                  sombre and apparently impassable, impregnable mountain fastnesses, and the
                  unfathomed beds of its mighty rivers—the sources of which are unknown, may contain
                  treasures, such as the world has not hitherto dreamed of—may form a barrier to
                  wonders, such as have never yet startled mankind. Who knows—who can surmise what
                  may be the condition of the interior of this vast continent? Will it always be
                  thus? We believe not. We think that the day will arrive when Africa, shunned and
                  despised now, will furnish a, wide and ample field for the labors of the
                  philanthropist and the man of science, and for the enterprise and energy of the
                  traveller and the merchant. Then, and not until then, when it is destroyed at then
                  fountain head, will the ban of slavery be removed, and the shocking scenes it has
                  been, and still will be our duty to depict, be seen, and heard of no more: then,
                  and not until then, will its, debased population become capable of asserting and
                  maintaining their rights, as denizens of the earth's surface and men made after
                  the image of the Creator, although their skins are darkened by the rays of an
                  ardent sun, their intellect brutalized by ages of paganism, and their spirit
                  crushed and subdued because "the hand of every man is turned against them," The
                  islands upon the coast of Africa, and those scattered in the bights of Biaffra and
                  Benin, are as famed for their fertile soil and theft magnificent scenery, as the
                  adjacent coast; and some instances as dreaded for their deadly climate. This is
                  the case with Fernando Po, St. Thomas, and the larger islands; but the latter
                  remark does not apply to those of smaller magnitude, the atmosphere of which is
                  kept cool and healthful by sea breezes, which penetrate throughout their whole
                  surface. These are lovely oases in the desert of ocean, and amongst these one of
                  the most beautiful, most fertile, and most healthful, is the delightful island of
                  Annabon.</p>
               <p>We have already briefly described the abode of Zuleika. It was situated near the
                  seaside, and embosomed in the forest, although there were several vistas through
                  which might be seen glimpses of lovely landscape stretching far into the
                  perspective. Winding paths through the forest and amidst the cane-brakes led to
                  various favorite spots of Zuleika's, where she loved to wander and repose on the
                  soft turf, and where she had caused arbors of mango trees to be formed in which
                  she could rest sheltered from the too ardent rays of the sun during the noonday
                  heats. There was one spot which was an especial favorite with her, and there, one
                  morning about three weeks after Captain Seymour had left for the coast, she and
                  Harry Davis had wandered together.</p>
               <p>This place was more, scant of trees than most parts of the island, and the scenery
                  around resembled more that of the temperate zones in its type, although the broad
                  leaves of the palm and cocoa trees, and the broad-bladed herbage and
                  wide-spreading cactuses and other prickly shrubs, still stamped it with the
                  impress of tropical verdure. In the back-ground, right in the centre of the
                  island, rose a range of lofty s and rugged mountains, covered half-way to the
                  summit with trees and herbage; but the lofty peaks of which were bleak and bare,
                  and sharply defined against the deep blue, clear, tropical sky.</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7191-00000055"/>
               <p>The island was but small, but this range of mountains—dome upon dome, peak—heaped
                  in very confusion as though an Atlas had stumbled with his burden and left the
                  broken fragments of a world behind him—gave an air of vastness and grandeur to the
                  view, and allowed free scope to the fancy to imagine a perspective of unmeasured
                  depth; the slopes of these mountains were lost amidst the forest growth which
                  stretched on either side around this favorite spot, and inclosed it, as it were,
                  in an amphitheatre, through the centre of which, between slopes coveted with
                  verdure and studded with picturesque clumps of trees, coursed a wide rivulet, on
                  which were several little islands thickly grown with long grass and reeds and
                  shrubbery, and around which the water rapidly flowing towards the sea temporarily
                  impeded in its course, whirled and rippled and created miniature whirlpools, A
                  grove of cocoas and palms thickly intertwined with parasite shrubbery, rich in
                  wild flowers of gorgeous coloring, grew along the margin of the rivulet, which
                  here and there widened and formed miniature bays and harbors, sheltered, shaded,
                  and darkened by the dense overhanging brushwood and a poet's fancy might have
                  dreamed that the wood nymphs and naiads of heathen mythology loved to sport and
                  play amidst the cool waters, or to rest beneath the cover of the foliage. Groups
                  of goats and antelopes which Seymour had caused to be brought from the southern
                  coast, bounded over the flowery turf, or leaped amongst the rocks and clambered
                  the hillocks which rose around in picturesque confusion, fearless of the attack of
                  the wild beasts of the forest, for these, though numerous on the coast are unknown
                  to the islands, where the largest and wildest inhabitant of the jungle is the
                  monkey or the squirrel. They had grown to know Zuleika, and would come bounding
                  toward her at her call, and feed from her hands, allowing her to pat and stroke
                  their soft, glossy coats. The rivulet broke into miniature Waterfall just above
                  the spot on which Zuleika had caused an arbor, covered with flowering acacias, to
                  be constructed and few yards beneath this, many hued fishes basked and played it
                  the sunshine; or darted to and fro in the clear water, their very rapid motion
                  marked by a streak of silvery lighting flashing into the eyes of the beholder.</p>
               <p>In this arbor, about three weeks (as we have said) after Captain Seymour had
                  returned to the coast, Zuleika and Harry were seated, alternately conversing
                  together, or reading the books that were strewn about, and which had been brought
                  from the cottage by Zuleika's negro attendant, or gazing upon the falling water
                  sparkling in the sunbeams, and displaying all the colors of the prism, and
                  watching the fishes as they darted to and fro, catching the crumbs of bread thrown
                  them by the youth and maiden.</p>
               <p>Harry could, speak, as we have said, a few words of Spanish, and could understand
                  much more, when he first arrived at Annabon; but, it was astonishing with what
                  rapidity he had progressed during the short period he had been there. He now found
                  no difficulty in conversing with Zuleika—in broken language, it is true, but such
                  as she could readily understand; and though she often smiled archly and
                  good-naturedly at his blunders and his utter defiance of the rules of grammar, she
                  sought to adapt her language to his comprehension; and thus they got along very
                  well together, as Captain Seymour had said they would when he left them.</p>
               <p>"And is America, then, as beautiful as this land? Are there such sweet scenes
                  there as this upon which we are now gazing?" asked Zuleika, in reply to some
                  remark made by her companion.</p>
               <p>"America is a vast continent," replied Harry; "and there is a great variety of
                  scenery. In the southern parts, though I have never been there, it may much
                  resemble this; but, though more rugged, even where I have been, the country is in
                  summer very beautiful."</p>
               <p>"Seymour has told me of cold, and snow which falls in winter, and I have read of
                  it in books; it must be strange. I should like to, see it;" and the young girl
                  sunk into a temporary reverie, her large eyes fixed on vacancy, as though the
                  scene she wished to visit floated before her mental vision.</p>
               <p>Harry sat gazing with a strange admixture of feelings upon her extraordinary
                  beauty; at length he gave vent to a long drawn sigh, which aroused the attention
                  of his companion.</p>
               <p>"You sigh—you are unhappy?" she said, inquiringly. "Why is it so? I would see
                  every one happy. Yet I often notice that you are thoughtful and spiritless. Why is
                  it so?"</p>
               <p>"Are you always happy, Zuleika?" asked Harry, evading the question, and, Yankee
                  fashion, substituting another.</p>
               <p>"No, not always. I often feel discontented at the thought of being confined to
                  this small island, or rather to the cultivated portion of it; for, small as it is,
                  the interior neither I nor any of my negroes have seen. And yet I
                     <emph>should</emph> be happy;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7191-00000056"/>
                  Seymour loves me and does every thing m his power to make me happy."</p>
               <p>"And you love him?"</p>
               <p>"Love him! How can I do otherwise? He is all in all to me—the only protector,
                  father, brother, lover, I have ever known; and he is my husband. Love him! yes,
                  dearer than I love my own life. Some day he will take me hence, or come here and
                  Jive with me always; he says so, and Seymour never told me a falsehood—and
                  then—yes then—I shall not want to leave this island; Is not George handsome?" she
                  added; "I have seen many men whom he has brought here, and sometimes I have seen
                  Portuguese traders here; but none, oh, none of them can compare with him.'</p>
               <p>"You were not born here?" asked Harry, his long pent-up curiosity respecting
                  Zuleika getting the better of his delicacy, of introducing questions regarding a
                  matter she had never dwelt upon.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no," and the girl laughed merrily. "No, Senor Harry, I was not born here—but
                  I was a child when George brought me here in his vessel. I recollect little of the
                  world but this island, and a convent in Granada—and sometimes I have an indistinct
                  recollection of something else, but what I cannot say. It is of an island—not
                  this, but like this—and a seashore such as we now see in the distance, in the
                  rippling waters of which the rays of the sun shone reflected as they do now upon
                  yonder sea—and of little playmates, and a woman who was perhaps my mother; but all
                  is seen as through a mist in my childhood's recollection. Harry, have you a
                  mother? My mother I never knew. George always evades the subject, and speaks to
                  himself in English, when I turn the conversation towards that point."</p>
               <p>A tear glistened in the eyes of the boy, as he replied:</p>
               <p>"Yes, Zuleika; I have a mother who loves me dearly."</p>
               <p>"And a father, and a brother and sister?" asked Zuleika.</p>
               <p>"My father is dead, but I have a brother in America—perhaps now, though, he is
                  upon the sea; he is to be a sailor. I have no sister."</p>
               <p>"I wish I had a brother and sister—at least a sister. George is my brother and my
                  husband too; but there are so many Masons why I should like sister. You are not
                  married—you have no wife?" she asked, suddenly breaking off in her abrupt way.</p>
               <p>"I have no wife," replied Harry, smiling; "why do you ask? I am too young to
                  marry."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Not too young to love," replied the girl; "I have loved Seymour as long I can
                  recollect. I could not live without his love—but then <emph>you</emph> have a
                  brother to love, and I never had brother or sister."</p>
               <p>She remained silent and thoughtful for several minutes, carelessly stroking the of
                  a favorites fawn, which followed her from amongst a group of antelopes like dog.
                  At length she said:</p>
               <p>"Harry, tell me your history. You are not like other sailor seen; they are coarse
                  and rough—you are gentle and kind—just as I should like my brother to be if
                  heaven. You shall be my brother," she added smiling in his face, and taking his
                  hand in her own. "Tell your sister your, history, Harry."</p>
               <p>"It is a mournful relation; perhaps some day I will tell it you. You ask me,
                  Zuleika, if I have ever loved? Yes; truly, fondly, trustingly. I set my heart upon
                  an idol, as you have done upon Seymour, and found my idol dashed to the ground
                  when I had forsaken all else to devote myself to its worship Nay more—I found that
                  the image I had set up before me as pure gold was but base clay. I was doubly
                  deceived; all my hopes blasted; myself—never mind—perhaps some day I will tell you
                  all—but—not now." He ceased speaking, and with difficulty suppressed his
                  emotion.</p>
               <p>"Porr Harry—how I pity you," replied the girl, a tear gilt-tering in her large
                  dark eyes. "It must be dreadful to love and not be loved again. If Seymour did not
                  love me, I should pray daily hourly, for death. If he were aught else than he
                  is—so good, so gentle, so kind, so handsome, so devotedly attached to me—I should
                     <emph>love</emph> him still, with all my soul—that I could not help; but I
                  should pine away and die with grief. Oh! the thought is too terrible—no wonder you
                  are unhappy Harry,"—and again she pressed his hand—"but I will be your sister, and
                  I will ask George to let you stay with me always He will do so;—he will refuse me
                  nothing, he loves me so dearly."</p>
               <p>Harry returned the pressure. "Poor girl!" he said, mentally, may your idol never
                  be shattered—may he be always to <emph>you</emph> what he is now; but—I fear the
                  future."</p>
               <p>The conversation had conjured up melancholy thoughts in the minds of both, and
                  they sat silently upon the mossy bank of the<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000057"/> arbor until the lengthening shadows warned them
                  that the brief twilight of a tropical sunset was approaching.</p>
               <p>Zuleika was the first to speak.</p>
               <p>"Let us go home, Harry," she said. "It will soon grow dark. We will each learn our
                  tasks—you, your Spanish; I, my English lesson—and then you shall sing to me while
                  I accompany you on the guitar. Your voice is soft and low. Not like Seymour's;
                  nobody can sing like him, to my fancy—he has such a deep, manly voice; but yours
                  is pretty, and soft almost as mine. Come, let us go."</p>
               <p>They arose from their seats, and made their way through the narrow path, trodden
                  amidst the brushwood and long, rank grass, which led to the cottage, some half
                  mile distant.</p>
               <p>We have observed that the islands of the African coast are free from the ravages
                  of savage beasts; but the deadly snake lurks in the forests and burrows amidst the
                  dead leaves, although it seldom ventures into the clearings, and always flies at
                  the approach of human beings.</p>
               <p>Harry, being the taller and stronger of the two, was walking first, and pushing
                  aside the tangled branches tot his companion, for the trodden path, which led by a
                  short cut to the house, only permitted them to walk in single file. They had
                  reached a turn in the path, which necessitated them to climb up a flight of steps
                  rudely cut in the rock, and Harry was preparing to clamber up Zuleika being few
                  steps behind, when the latter was alarmed by hearing her companion shriek. She
                  gazed at him with a look of horror imprinted upon her features; a huge black
                  snake, which had teen nestling amongst the long grass at the base of the rocks,
                  had suddenly coiled itself around Harry, and was hissing furiously and darting its
                  fangs at his legs. Zuleika, in her turn, gave vent to a piercing scream, which
                  brought a negro belonging the plantation, who was fortunately within hearing, to
                  their assistance. Meanwhile, the venomous reptile had made its escape. Zuleika
                  stood transfixed with terror; but Harry had fainted.</p>
               <p>The former soon recovered herself and saw that the negro, observing the marks of
                  the fangs of the reptile in Harry's trowsers had wisely drawn off his boots, for
                  the purpose of applying such herbs as long practice had taught these simple
                  creatures were an antidote to the poison of the most deadly snake, if applied in
                  time. The boots however; which Harry had put on that day for the purpose of
                  protecting his legs from the various prickly shrubs which so abound in these
                  Islands, had happily resisted the efforts of the reptile, and excepting the fright
                  he had sustained, he was unharmed.</p>
               <p>"Don't fear, Senorita Zuleika," said the negro, "de boy is not hurt; only de
                  fright he hab got. By de holy virgin, Senorita, it would be pity such a foot and
                  leg as Senor Harry hab got should be bit by de snake and poisoned. G'ah—it is like
                  a senora's—so white and delicate."</p>
               <p>"Carry him home to the cottage, Ninez," said Zuleika. "Poor fellow; he has fainted
                  away; no wonder! Make haste and carry him to the cottage that we may apply
                  restoratives. You had better call for some one to assist you."</p>
               <p>"No matter, Senorita—no matter," replied the burly black, lifting the light form
                  of Harry as though it were a feather weight, "Golly! Senorita, he is no more
                  weight den you-sef—light as a girl."</p>
               <p>Ninez quickly bore the fainting form of the lad to the cottage, followed by
                  Zuleika, and by her direction placed him on a couch in the apartment. He was about
                  to summon one of the negresses, but was prevented by Zuleika, who saw that Harry
                  showed symptoms of coming to himself.</p>
               <p>"Let him lie there, Ninez" said she, "he will soon better. See, he is opening his
                  eyes. I will undo his vest and shirt collar, and bathe his face with water. He
                  will soon be well again; poor fellow! no wonder he was frightened at the dreadful
                  reptile. He has perhaps never seen one of them before."</p>
               <p>The negro left the room as he was directed and Zuleika commenced to unfasten the
                  upper portions of Harry's clothing and to bathe his face with water.</p>
               <p>In a moment she started and looked bewildered. Her face flushed crimson and she
                  stepped to the door, as though about to call for Assistance, but she returned
                  again and gazed upon the fainting boy's features, earnestly—intently. Harry opened
                  his eyes and saw heir bending over him.</p>
               <p>Where am I?" said he. "Oh! I recollect that frightful reptile! but you are not
                  hurt Zuleika? We are safe now. How did we escape the serpent? Zuleika, what ails
                  you?" he suddenly exclaimed; starting up from the couch. "You are pallid as
                  death—tell we you are not hurt?" In a moment some strange idea seemed to flash
                  though his mind; he glanced at his shirt collar unbuttoned, the breast thrown
                  open, and his features, but a moment before pale as the young girl's, flushed
                  crimson to the very temples. He endeavored to speak, but the stuck in his throat
                  and he could not give them utterance<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7191-00000058"/> He
                  advanced towards the girl, but she pushed his extended hand from her with a fury
                  that he had not supposed her capable of. All the latent fire of her Greek nature
                  flashed in her eyes. "Go," she said. "Go hence—touch me not. Ah! was it a fable
                  you told me? <emph>You</emph> have shattered <emph>my</emph> idol, even at the
                  moment when I worshipped it with the most trusting devotion." She flung herself on
                  a couch and gave way, to a flood of tears, while the cause of this distress stood
                  gating upon her, motionless and pale as a marble statue, for the color had now
                  fled from his brow, and his heart had sunk within him. He was
                  speechless—overpowered by a variety of contrary and almost stiffling emotions.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Captain Junot relates his mishaps in consequence of falling in with a
                     cruiser—Captain Seymour visits Annabon—The secret is kept from him—Harry is

               </argument>
               <p>"HILLOA, Junot, what the d——l's the row?" shouted Captain Seymour, as the pinnace
                  came up alongside the Dolphin, "You've been, in the wars, it seems. Where did, you
                  meet with the mishap?"</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mille tonnerres</foreign> Seymour, <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">Es'ce vous?</foreign> You have escaped then; but come on board,
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign> and I will tell you."</p>
               <p>The sails of the pinnace were lowered, and a rope having been thrown, her from the
                  deck of the Dolphin, she came alongside. Captain Seymour came on board, and then
                  the boat was dropped astern, and the two captains walked aft to the quarterdeck
                  together.</p>
               <p>"Now, Junot" said Captain Seymour, "let's hear the news, I see you've been at
                  close quarters with somebody; when I first sighted you I thought you had met with
                  bad weather, but as I came up I saw signs of another sort of conflict."</p>
               <p>"I have fallen in with those cursed English cruisers and had a narrow chance of
                  capture too; luckily the Dolphin has a good pair, of heels, in a light breeze, and
                  those lumbering British crafts, d—n'em, they can't sail unless they have the tail
                  end of a hurricane blowing at their sterns."</p>
               <p>"The d—1! How was it, Junot?" inquired Captain Seymour.</p>
               <p>"Why, you see, some days after you and I parted company, I hauled my wind,
                  thinking I'd kept out of the way long enough to throw the cruisers off the scent,
                  and knowing a chap in Liberia had smuggled a lot of <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >emancipados,</foreign> who had been sent on shore from a slaver a short time
                  before, to an assignee on the Ivory coast, for the purpose of selling 'em over
                  again, I thought I would try if I couldn't make a spec with them before I ran down
                  to Loango. Well, a few days afterwards, I made Cape Palmas, keeping close in shore
                  so as to hug the coast all the way along, and satisfy myself that there were no
                  cruisers lurking about: when <foreign xml:lang="FRA">diable!</foreign> just as I
                  doubled Cape Tabou, what should I see but the two infernal brigs, both lying off
                  and on in the bay, their boats being ashore watering. It was before daylight in
                  the morning, and the land being high thereabouts and they close under it, I never
                  saw them till they had me in the trap, although, curse them, they had seen the
                  Dolphin in the offing. The first I knew of their proximity was, bang—bang—bang; by
                  G—d, a whole broadside poured into the Dolphin, though luckily the shots were
                  fired too high; they wanted to hit the lower masts and topmasts, and the d—ls only
                  managed to carry away my top-gallant masts. As soon as the smoke cleared away a
                  bit, and I recovered from my astonishment at this warm reception, I saw plainly
                  enough both crafts loosing their courses—they were only under their topsails, but
                  were setting their topgallant sails to make chase.</p>
               <p>"You may be sure I backed out fast enough and got clear of the point before they
                  had got their boats aboard and were ready to follow me. They thought they had
                  disabled me, no doubt, and therefore wen't in any great hurry; but they were
                  deceived. The Dolphin was too much for them, even without her top-gallant sails,
                  and after a few hours' chase, in the course of which I ran them nearly hull down,
                  they returned into port, and I shaped the best of my course here. Now you have
                  heard all I have got to say."</p>
               <p>"Damnation!" exclaimed Seymour, stamping his foot with vexation. "We shall have
                  them down upon us here, both together and here have I got my cargo of darkies all
                  ready for shipment; This is a d—l of a job."</p>
               <p>"I don't think there's any cause for alarm, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Monsieur
                     Capitaine,</foreign>" replied Junot. "They've been cruising off here for
                  several weeks, and old Kettle has thrown them off the scent. My opinion is, that
                  having seen me off Tabou, they'll search<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7191-00000059"
                  /> the whole length of the Ivory and Gold Coasts, down to Cape Coast
                  Castle—thinking that it is thereabouts we are likely to search for our freight. To
                  my knowledge there is a lot of Portuguese craft hanging about there, and they'll
                  be so busy with them that they'll give us plenty of time to be off from this.
                  That's why I shaped my course here, as soon as I got out of the sight of the cape.
                  Altogether, there's not much harm done, except the loss of my top-gallant
                  spars.</p>
               <p>"If that's all, I can soon replace them. I was just going off to Annabon, but I'll
                  return on shore and put things in train first, in case of accident."</p>
               <p>Seymour gave orders for the pinnace to be hauled alongside, and getting on board
                  he returned to the town, the Dolphin meanwhile coming to an anchor in the bay a
                  short distance from the Albatross.</p>
               <p>Under the present circumstances Captain Seymour thought it advisable to proceed
                  with the shipment of his cargo of slaves without delay; that is to say, he caused
                  them to be put on board immediately, with the exception of some of the women,
                  among whom was the <hi rend="i"/>Yunga Jagos woman, whom he thought it was perhaps
                  advisable to allow to remain on shore, and to recruit their strength as much as
                  possible before they were consigned to the horrible packing of a slave ship's
                  hold, even under the most favorable circumstances. The slaves daily expected from
                  Quaddah he ordered to be also taken on board as goon as they arrived, with the
                  exception of such of the females as might have become fatigued and weakened during
                  the journey; these were to be placed with the other women, and every means
                  employed to restore them to health, and having thus arranged matters, ordering Mr.
                  Tolcroft, in case he heard anything of the arrival of the cruisers in the
                  neighborhood, to take all on board forthwith, and to proceed to Annabon and lay
                  off and on for him, he left, in the pinnace, for that island, He resolved that he
                  would not under any circumstances, disappoint Zuleika, although he feared that his
                  promised visit Would be necessarily much abridged. Meanwhile Captain Junot, having
                  been provided; with rough spars from; the Albatross, set his carpenter to work to
                  make new top-gallant masts and yards, and busied himself in hastening the chiefs
                  in their exertions to procure him a cargo.</p>
               <p>The passage of the pinnace to the island was effected as rapidly as upon the
                  former occasion—and late one evening, within the specified period of six weeks,
                  the boat was grounded in the little bay which formed the only harbor, and Seymour
                  leaped on shore, eager as he ever was, to meet the only object of his love, and
                  hurried on through the darkness to the cottage of Zuleika.</p>
               <p>Nearly three weeks had elapsed since the evening on which the attack of the
                  venomous snake upon Harry had led to the singular Conduct of Zuleika, after she
                  had caused the fainting boy to beamed into her own private apartment by the negro
                  Ninez. The reader will recollect that we left Zuleika in tears upon the couch, and
                  Harry standing gazing upon her, scarcely conscious, and utterly unable; to reply
                  to her invectives.</p>
               <p>Several minutes he stood thus; at length he ventured to approach the weeping girl,
                  and gently took her hand.</p>
               <p>"Dear Zuleika," he said, "do not repulse me. I am sufficiently wretched; indeed I
                  am incapable of doing or thinking of evil towards you."</p>
               <p>The young girl's hand trembled in his grasp and a convulsive shudder passed
                  through her frame. She had ceased weeping, but her bosom was violently heaving,
                  showing the intensity of the feelings that were burning within. She burst into a
                  renewed fit of weeping as lie spoke, and at first made a motion to withdraw her
                  hand but it was not withdrawn.</p>
               <p>"Leave me," she sobbed, leave me. Oh, my God—I cannot talk to-night. Leave me to
                  myself. I will try to sleep. To-morrow I will see you; and—Harry—God grant you may
                  be able satisfactorily to account for yourself."</p>
               <p>Harry did not offer to remain—he knew—he felt—that at present the poor child would
                  be best left to herself; but he stopped and kissed her brow, and whispered in her
                  ear:</p>
               <p>"Believe me, Zuleika, all will be explained—all will be well with
                     <emph>you.</emph> Seymour loves you devotedly, I have had proof of that. I
                  alone am doomed to wretchedness."</p>
               <p>Harry, as well as the young Greek girl, pressed a sleepless couch that night, as
                  the haggard looks of both it the morning sufficiently testified. According to
                  Zuleika's expressed wish, Harry met her on the morrow; he was startled by the
                  expression of her countenance—so grief-worn, so dejected. Poor girl! she had
                  passed a night of intense anguish, felt ail $he more severely because it was the
                  first real sorrow she had ever known. Heretofore her life—at least since she had
                  passed the age of childhood—had been as a sunbeam, flitting hither and thither,
                  enlivening all it gleamed upon. The little troubles she had known had been merely
                  as the specks in tile sunbeam, which slightly mar its transparency, without
                  impairing its<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7191-00000060"/> lightness and beauty. Now
                  it appeared to her as though her young heart was crushed; as she had expressed
                  herself in her first burst of passion to Harry—now her idol was scattered; the
                  anchor, to the firmness of which she had trusted her hopes, had been broken. She
                  had lost "her hope, her life her joy, her all," and she felt as though that one
                  blow was sufficient to render her future life wretched.</p>
               <p>She received Harry in her own apartment, and for some hours they remained
                  together. It was past noon when they came forth. Harry was calm and composed, and
                  the deep gloom had left the brow of Zuleika; but a shaded of melancholy, unusual
                  to her features, still rested upon them, and a strange perplexity, as if she could
                  scarcely yet understand what had been revealed to her in that secret interview,
                  was apparent in her countenance.</p>
               <p>Still it was evident that confidence had been restored; nay, more than confidence;
                  for the arm of Harry was entwined around the slender waist of his companion, and
                  her hand rested lovingly upon his shoulder; and from time to time the Greek girl
                  raised her head towards Harry's face, and a glance of pity, mingled with the
                  expression of perplexity already noticed. They wandered towards the sea, beach,
                  and strolled for some hours along the pebbly shore.</p>
               <p>"And you are sure, quite sure that he loves me, as you say?" said Zuleika, in
                  reply to some remark from her companion.</p>
               <p>"Quite sure," replied the other. "Oh, Zuleika, I felt as you did; yesterday, when
                  I first saw that picture in the locket."</p>
               <p>"And he so much admired the picture?" said the girl, her beautiful features
                  losing, for a time, their melancholy expression, and lighting up into a delighted
                  smile.</p>
               <p>He did; who could help admiring it?" answered Harry, kindly; "and he told me I
                  should, perhaps, one day see the original, and bade me not be jealous;" and Harry
                  Smiled as he spoke. "Zuleika," he added, "I am not flattering you—but had I been
                  what both you and he deemed me, he might have had reason for his warning."</p>
               <p>The young girl blushed, and innocently, yet archly, asked:</p>
               <p>"Do you, then, think me so very beautiful?"</p>
               <p>"I do."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am so glad of it!"</p>
               <p>"Why, Zuleika?"</p>
               <p>"For George's sake," she replied; "but you are very beautiful tiful, Harry—even
                  disguised as you are. Are your countrywomen handsome?"</p>
               <p>"Many of them exceedingly so; but few, very few can boast of beauty such as
                  yours."</p>
               <p>Again the girl blushed, and falteringly remarked:</p>
               <p>"Perhaps George may think some of them more beautiful than me."</p>
               <p>"Set your heart at rest on that score, dear Zuleika," replied Harry; "Captain
                  Seymour, I have reason to know, loves you with a love that cannot be surpassed. If
                  you can be happy living in the knowledge of his love, you may well be so." He
                  turned aside his head and thought to himself, "God grant, poor, artless, confiding
                  child, that the misfortunes which threaten you in the future may never burst upon
                  your head—better before that day arrive that you be laid quietly at rest in your
                  grave."</p>
               <p>It is time, so far as the reader is concerned, that we raised the veil of mystery
                  which has thus far surrounded Henry Davis—or Jane Miller—for ere this he must have
                  seen through the filmy gauze. There are yet enough strange mysteries connected
                  with our tale to allow of our raising the curtain and exposing this. Harry's sex
                  was known to Zuleika, but to her alone; it was a long, long period, and many
                  strange scenes were passed through ere Captain Seymour was aware of the fact.</p>
               <p>When Jane Miller, therefore, had quitted Zuleika on the occasion mentioned above,
                  and had returned to her own apartment, she struggled long and arduously with her
                  own feelings as to the course she should pursue. She felt convinced of the
                  innocence and artlessness of the young Greek girl, and believed that she could
                  easily satisfy her with regard to the strong affection Captain Seymour entertained
                  towards her. She deeply pitied her in her heart, for she knew nothing of the
                  circumstances connected with her history—nothing of her marriage by the Portuguese
                  padre on the island of Annabon—and she did, not therefore know that she was in
                  reality Seymour's, wife. This she learnt on the morrow, and while, for Zuleika's
                  sake, in one sense, she was glad to hear it, she perhaps pitied her still the
                  more. She at first resolved in her own mind that she would tell her all: that she
                  would expose Seymour's Character to her, and teach her the true worth of the man
                  upon whom she had bestowed the whole treasure of her innocent love—for Jane Miller
                  was but human, and she could not help, in spite of herself, feeling a degree of
                  jealousy which, in the first instance,<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7191-00000061"/>
                  had approached to the verge of hatred towards her successful although innocent and
                  unconscious rival; but this had died away, and had been succeeded, as we have
                  said, by a feeling of pity and deep sorrow for the future prospects, of one whom
                  she was conscious deserved a happier fate than that which was probably in store
                  for her; one who was, by education and natural temperament, so little calculated
                  to endure the burden of a broken spirit; but she changed her mind, and finally
                  determined that she would only explain the reasons which led her to quit her horns
                  on so wild, so unmaidenly an adventure. She knew that, by acting as she had done,
                  and thus boldly repudiating the conventionalities of the social frame-work of
                  civilized society, she had forfeited all claim to the respect of her own sex at
                  home; but she knew that the artless yet ardent Greek girl, would think but lightly
                  of this—that she came from a people who listen not to the cold dictates of reason
                  when the feelings of the heart are stirred—and she then thought it her duty to set
                  the heart of the poor child at rest; to assure her of Seymour's love for her and
                  her alone, and then to let the matter rest, deeming wisely that "sufficient to the
                  day is the evil thereof." Accordingly Zuleika was told that she (Jane Miller) had
                  loved Seymour, and had resolved to follow him to sea, with what purpose she
                  scarcely knew; but to carry out this object she had forsaken all—mother, home, and
                  friends—but she had discovered, by means of the locket containing the portrait,
                  that he loved another too dearly; for his affections ever to be transferred, and
                  she had therefore resolved to bury her secret in her own bosom—to declare it to no
                  one—had not Zuleika so singularly discovered it. All this seemed plausible enongh,
                  even right, and as she would herself have acted to the artless, warm-blooded,
                  ardent Greek girl, utterly ignorant of the conventionalities of life. She
                  listened, doubted, and last avowed her full belief and confidence in the narrator
                  Thus matters rested when the two girls walked out on the sea beach of the island
                  together.</p>
               <p>"And now," said Jane, "to you alone, dear Zuleika, have I entrusted this secret;
                  it is yours to keep locked within your breast. No sign must be made, no word
                  spoken in the presence of others, winch may lead to an exposure. I hate told you
                  Jill in confidence. I have trusted to your generosity. You must not betray
                  me."</p>
               <p>"And I will not," replied Zuleika, pressing the hand of her companion.</p>
               <p>"And you will call me Harry still, and treat me, at least before others, and
                  especially before your hus——before Captain Seymour, as you have hitherto done."
                  (She could not yet bring herself, to acknowledge Seymour to be the husband of
                  Zuleika. Indeed, she believed still that the poor girl had been duped.)</p>
               <p>"I will," answered the girl; "but," she continued, "you will go home in George's
                  ship, and go to your mother's home again?"</p>
               <p>"Alas! I dare not return home again. You, Zuleika, are ignorant—happily, perhaps,
                  ignorant of the regulations of society as it exists amongst us. No, no, I have for
                  ever placed a barrier between myself and those near and dear to me. I shall not
                  stay longer than I can help with Captain Seymour. I shall go to Cuba or the
                  Brazilian coast, for thither is the Albatross bound, and not to the United States;
                  but my future is a blank"—and she mentally added, "as I fear, my poor child, yours
                  is also."</p>
               <p>The mournful tone in which she spake drew tears to the eyes of Zuleika. She walked
                  on in silence for some moments. At length she said:</p>
               <p>"Then why not remain here with me? George said, when last he was here, he would
                  get me a companion. If I ask him, he will allow you to remain here until he gives
                  up the sea."</p>
               <p>"He did not mean a companion such as he conceives me to be," replied Jane,
                  mournfully smiling: "you forget, Zuleika; he thinks of me still as his cabin
                  boy."</p>
               <p>"Still, if I ask him, he will let you stay—at least until he returns with the
                  companion he has promised me. I will ask him: of that I am determined; but you
                  will stay, will you not," she added—" you will stay if he gives you
                  permission?"</p>
               <p>The idea had not, heretofore, struck Jane; but she had begun to feel her solitary
                  position in the world. She now felt how utterly she had isolated herself, and she
                  replied:</p>
               <p>"Yes; if without my seeking, Captain Seymour, is desirous at your request, that I
                  should stay, dear Zuleika, I <emph>will.</emph>"</p>
               <p>That beach was, hence forward, the customary and favorite walk of the young women;
                  for no persuasions of Zuleika could again tempt Jane to venture into the
                  cane-brakes; and here, in the cool of the evening, they daily strolled, chatting
                  together on various subjects connected with America and the customs of other
                  lands; but the burden of every theme of<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7191-00000062"/>
                  conversation was sure to resolve itself in the end, on the part of Zuleika, into
                  praises of George Seymour.</p>
               <p>One evening, while thus strolling, just as they were on the point of going home to
                  the cottage, Zuleika's practiced, eye discovered the white sail of Seymour's
                  pinnace in the distance, although, to Jane Miller, it appeared only like the white
                  wing of a sea bird, hovering low down in the horizon. Zuleika, however, was
                  certain that it was he, returned to pay his promised visit, and she lingered until
                  the boat drew near enough to render assurance, doubly sure—then she and Jane
                  hastened to the bay into which the boat had entered, which was a long distance
                  from their accustomed walk, and they met the captain just as he had, turned off
                  from the beach in the direction of the cottage.</p>
               <p>One moment more, and Zuleika was in his arms, and nestling like a young bird on
                  his bosom.</p>
               <p>"Ah! my Zuleika—you here to meet me? By my faith, darling, but I wish I had half a
                  score of such trusty watchers on board the Albatross. And so you saw the pinnace
                  coming into the bay, did you? and Harry, here, too! Well, Harry, how have you and
                  Zuleika managed to get along together? Does Harry speak <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >Castellano</foreign> yet, Zuleika? If he doesn't, he must have been a sad
                  laggard and deserves to be whipped."</p>
               <p>Thus gaily conversing, the captain, with Zuleika hanging delightedly upon his arm,
                  and Jane Miller walking behind, strolled leisurely on towards the cottage, and as
                  they neared the plantation, the negroes rushed out with shouts of delight to
                  welcome his return.</p>
               <p>A sigh escaped from Seymour's breast:</p>
               <p>"How happy could I be, even; here, with Zuleika, would fortune and fate allow me
                  such a haven of rest," he thought to himself "but no; it must not be yet, it may
                  never be."</p>
               <p>The joy of the young bride was considerably damped however, when she learnt that,
                  owing, to unforeseen, circumstances, her husband's visit must of necessity be
                  considerably abridged, and that two or three days at the furthest was all the time
                  he could spare. "But it will riot, let us hope, be much longer, my Zuleika," he
                  added.</p>
               <p>"One or two voyages more—a year or two furthest—and then love, we shall be always
                  together. A year or two at furthest! Who can venture to predict what a year or two
                  may bring forth.</p>
               <p>But noticing the poor child's dejected looks, he added. "Cheer up Zuleika—I will
                  not forget to bring you out the companion I spake of—and then you will have some
                  one to converse with while I am absent. Poor little thing I" and he patted her
                  head land took her upon his knee, as if she had been really but a child, and he
                  her father. "You must be very dull and lonesome here. Never mind, darling, you
                  shall have gayer times in future."</p>
               <p>The young girl strove to be cheerful; her gloom was always of brief duration, and
                  in a few minutes she was prattling cheerfully—happy in the present, forgetful of
                  the past, and heedless of the future. During the evening the captain spoke of
                  Harry—and learnt from Zuleika, that he had been a pleasant companion to her.</p>
               <p>"Will you not leave him here, at least during this voyage until you get me another
                  companion?" she asked.</p>
               <p>The captain smiled.</p>
               <p>"Really," said he, "I shall have reason to grow jealous of Harry, I am afraid.
                  Why, what a notion, darling! I must first get Harry's acquiescence—the boy may not
                  choose to be left here, even with my Zuleika for a companion."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I am sure he will consent," exclaimed Zuleika.</p>
               <p>For a moment a Strange suspicion seemed to have taken possession of Seymour's mind
                  but he looked into the clear, soft, dark eyes of the girl, and smiled
                  contemptuously at his own surmises. Strange to say; he had from the first treated
                  Harry as a pet child rather than as one of the crew, and the man who would have
                  struck fiercely to the ground any other person of the male sex, man or boy, who
                  would have dared to have looked with even too ardent admiration upon Zuleika, was
                  content to trust her in Harry's keeping.</p>
               <p>"If Harry pleases, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">mi tesora,</foreign> it shall be so;
                  but as I said, we must get his consent."</p>
               <p>The next day Seymour put the question to Harry, who thought it advisable at first
                  somewhat to demur.</p>
               <p>"I should not object to stay here a few months with Senorita Zuleika" said he
                  (while speaking of Jane Miller in her assumed character, we shall continue to make
                  use of the masculine gender), "but who will do my duties on board the
                  Albatross?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Harry" said the captain, laughing, "you must assuredly entertain a high
                  opinion of yourself, as a valuable hand on board the ship. Frank will go back to
                  his old duties until the ship arrives at the Brazils, when I will procure<pb
                     n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7191-00000063"/> cure a steward—that is if you feel
                  inclined to return; but please yourself, boy, I have no desire into force
                  you."</p>
               <p>"In that case I have no objection to stay," said Harry.</p>
               <p>"Well then, that! matter is settled; but mind, boy, you know the character of my
                  vessel and the nature of the service in which I am engaged. Not a word—not a hint
                  of this to Zuleika—or else you may dread my anger."</p>
               <p>Harry promised to keep silence on this subject, and they parted, the captain being
                  anxious to return to the short-lived society of his idol.</p>
               <p>"Let the world think of me as it may. Let my soul be stepped in crime; whatever
                  befals me, I would be pure and true in Zuleika's eyes" he muttered to himself as
                  he walked towards the cottage. "I would rather she should die, that I should
                  myself die a thousand deaths than that she should have the faintest suspicion that
                  I am aught else than an honest man. God forbid, she should know me as I am
                  now—whatever I may be in future.</p>
               <p>Tow days after this Captain Seymour quitted the island to return to his vessel,
                  and Zuleika was again left to her solitude—yet—not now to her former solitude, for
                  she had, though her husband knew it not, a female companion.</p>
               <p>We must non return with the reader to the coast where the Albatross and the
                  Dolphin were taking in their living freight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tolcroft had made strenuous exertions-during the Captain's! absence, and when
                  he returned he found that his cargo was complete—that is, that he had as he could
                  readily take ion board, for Captain Seymour abjured what is termed "close
                  packing," which consists in making a row of negroes sit with legs stretched apart,
                  while another row is packed between their legs, and so on until the deck is
                  filled. He found the mortality so great in the case, that of late he had adopted
                  "loose packing," in which the slaves are arranged in four ranks the; of the two
                  outer ranks touching the sides of the ship, their feet pointing athwart the
                  vessel, while another row is stowed heads against their feet, in the same fashion
                  on both sides; the little space remaining being filled up by negroes placed
                  lengthwise between the feet of the second row; thus each slave has as much space
                  as he can occupy lying; in "tight packing," only as much as he occupies sitting.
                  The vessel held considerably fewer by this stowage, but the greater portion were
                  thus brought in a better condition to the market, and realized considerably more
                  in the sale, although even in this case, on first starting, until the negroes got
                  used to the diet and to the motion of the ship, and until their numbers were
                  thinned out, the mortality was sometimes very great. Such scenes, when the deck is
                  full, surpass description in their sickening horror. Most of the unhappy creatures
                  are sea-sick, and when they are too weak to be brought upon deck in relays, the
                  filth is cleansed, if so it can be termed, by dashing water amongst them as they
                  lay vomiting and groaning and dying around. However, we will leave these horrible
                  scenes to the reader's imagination, and proceed with our story.</p>
               <p>Fearful of the visit of the cruisers, which might again receive information of
                  their presence to the coast, both Seymour and Junot were anxious to get away as
                  quickly as possible; and as the slaves were by this time brought to the coast; in
                  great abundance, this was an easy matter. Thus, in consequence of Junot's freight
                  being ready shortly after he arrived, both vessels were ready to sail
                  together.</p>
               <p>The last boat took off the women, and the few children that had been
                  purchased.</p>
               <p>Amongst the latter, Captain Junot had purchased two infants, both seemingly of an
                  age, and both mere babes. Their extreme youth attracted the notice of Seymour, as
                  Junot was carrying them on board the boat in his arms.</p>
               <p>"What the d——!" exclaimed Seymour, laughing, "Captain Junot turned wet nurse. Why,
                  Junot, what are you going to do with that bargain? Bless me, why they surely are
                  not yet weaned!"</p>
               <p>"The are fine, healthy children of the <hi rend="i"/>Yunga Jagos tribe," replied
                  Junot, "and I have a nurse on my plantation in Cuba, who will bring them up if I
                  can only get; them over the water alive. I shall make some of the women nurse
                  them. I got the brats cheap-and perhaps they'll turn out a good speculation. If
                  not, I can but throw them overboard to the sharks; they were very nearly becoming
                  food for the lions, any way."</p>
               <p>"How was that?" inquired Seymour, whose curiosity was excited. "I heard some tale
                  of that sort from the <hi rend="i"/>Mafookah at Quaddah."</p>
               <p>"Why they belong to a woman who was lately brought down to the coast—and she, it
                  appears, lagged behind with them, and the driver snatched them from her and threw
                  them into a cane-brake. He had been alarmed by the appearance of lions just
                  before, and he was afraid of losing the woman, who was a handsome girl, and would
                  fetch a good price. But somehow, those<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7191-00000064"/>
                  beasts are easily scared; the lions must have got frightened and run away; for
                  another driver passing by shortly afterwards, founds the children struggling and
                  squalling by the side of the cane-brake He picked them up. He thought he could at
                  least get a few hands of tobacco for them, and he gave them to the women and made
                  them take turns to carry them to the dépôt—where I took a fancy to buy them."</p>
               <p>"And a strange fancy, too. Why, I believe I have bought the mother; that handsome,
                  sleek-looking negress you see in the stern-sheets of the boat there, sulking, with
                  her head bent on her knees. She'll soon get over it, though; but for heaven's sake
                  keep the children out of her sight."</p>
               <p>"Why not sell me the woman?" asked Junot, "it'll save me a good deal of bother
                  with the children."</p>
               <p>"No, no, I can't part with her; I took a fancy to her and bought her on my own
                  account. She'll fetch a rousing price—she's as handsome and has as regular
                  features as a quadroon—and her color won't make odds in the Brazils, where I am
                  bound."</p>
               <p>"Buy the children of me then?" said Junot.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! pray excuse me, Captain Junot, I want none so young as them on board the
                  Albatross; I wish you joy nurse—for pity's sake don't let the children get sight
                  of your face," and Seymour, laughing at his joke, walked towards his own boat,
                  which lay at some distance from that of Captain Junot.</p>
               <p>Both boats, however, put off together, and the motion caused the infants to cry.
                  The mother heard and knew the wail of her infants' voices, borne across the
                  waters, and she grew frantic. It was with difficulty she could be withheld from
                  leaping overboard. She was, however, safely lodged on board. The next day the
                  vessels sailed in company and for two days the kept together.</p>
               <p>"That are a spry-looking lass takes on terrible about her children," said Mr.
                  Tolcroft to his commander on the third morning. "Mr. Allen tells me she won't eat
                  anything—it's my opinion she means to starve herself."</p>
               <p>"Bring her up upon deck and place her aft here tie her hands through to one of the
                  stancheons, or else she'll be jumping overboard. How do the negress get on
                  generally, Mr. Tolcroft?"</p>
               <p>"Why passably well; ten died on the first day and four yesterday. Allan only
                  picked out two dead 'uns this morning, he tells me—but there's three or four gone
                  stone blind with that disease they allers catches when they first start—it would
                  be just as well to heave 'em overboard at once."</p>
               <p>"Let the poor d—Is die first, Tolcroft; I never could fancy that tossing overboard
                  alive, unless in case of some great emergency. Bring up the woman, however."</p>
               <p>"I allers said you were too kind-hearted, Captain Seymour," replied Tolcroft, as
                  he turned to execute the order. "For my part, I goes in for no onnecessary
                  cruelty, but they will die in a day or two at any rate, and it's only a useless
                  consumption of provisions. Now there's Captain Junot, he——"</p>
               <p>"Captain Junot can do as he pleases on board his vessel, as I will do on board
                  mine," interrupted Seymour, sharply; "bring up the woman."</p>
               <p>The poor creature was brought up and fastened to a stancheou near the wheel.</p>
               <p>"Hallo! What the devil have we here, the cruisers by G—d!" suddenly exclaimed
                  Seymour, as two sail came out from beneath a headland, along which the two slavers
                  were coasting. "Junot is close in shore, and they'll have Him to a certainty—the
                  fool! I advised him to keep a good offing. Ha I all hands on deck—aloft; make sail
                  there. We must show our heels. It'll never do to be captured with all these slaves
                  on board," shouted the captain; and in a few moments all was bustle and confusion.
                  The Albatross was soon tearing along at a rapid speed away from the coast; but the
                  Dolphin, having less wind in shore, found it impossible to escape. It soon became
                  evident that she had struck her flag.</p>
               <p>"The fool! the coward!" muttered Seymour between his teeth. "I would have blown
                  her up before I would have surrendered."</p>
               <p>One of the cruisers, now bore down towards the Albatross, while the other took
                  possession of the prize. It was soon evident, however, that the chase would be of
                  no avail; and the captain fairly danced with glee when he saw his ship gradually
                  creeping away further and further from her pursuer.</p>
               <p>"Hey! what's that?" he cried, as he heard a sudden splash in the water astern.</p>
               <p>"It's the woman that was brought up here just now," said the man at the wheel;
                  "she has managed to loosen her hands, and has jumped overboard."</p>
               <p>It was true. In the excitement of the chase no one had perceived her, and the poor
                  creature had freed her limbs and<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7191-00000065"/> leaped
                  overboard—either to seek an ocean grave, or else in the hope that she could gain
                  the ship on board of which she knew her children to be.</p>
               <p>The latter appeared to be the case, for she struck out boldly in the direction of
                  the approaching cruiser.</p>
               <p>"D——n!" muttered Seymour, "that girl would have fetched me a thousand dollars.
                  Lower away, the boats," he shouted; "we'll have her yet. By G—d, she swims like a
                  fish. No, no; keep all fast—I forgot; we can't afford to lose time, with that d——d
                  cruiser at our heels." And the woman was left to her fate.</p>
               <p>It soon became evident, however, that she would be enabled to keep afloat until
                  the man of war reached her, and she was watched with much anxiety from the ship.
                  The water was smooth, and she could be seen from a great distance.</p>
               <p>"She's gone, I believe," said Seymour, watching the black spot on the water with
                  his glass. "No—there—she's up again. I wonder if the man-of-war will 'round to' to
                  pick her up. If she stops to do that we're safe. No, by heaven! she shows no sign
                  of seeing her. Ah! yes, she does. There go the studding sails—alow and aloft! Up
                  goes her fore course!"</p>
               <p>She sweeps round gracefully to the wind. Men are seen in the larboard chains with
                  ropes, which they heave to the poor drowning wretch as the ship "sags" down upon
                  her. She seizes a rope—is hauled alongside—half a dozen stout arms are extended,
                  and the <hi rend="i"/>Yunga Jagos woman is safe on board the man-of-war.</p>
               <p>But will she be restored to her children? The vessel they are on board of is a
                  prize to her preservers. We shall see.</p>
               <p>"Well, she's safe, and I don't know that I'm sorry for it," said Seymour. "I've
                  lost her, but she has served us, too, with her tantrums—she's enabled us to get
                  far ahead of the cruiser. Aye, fill away, my hearties! brail up the skysail!
                  shiver the main and mizzen—brace round the fore yard—right your helm and away.
                  What—you're going to try it again, are you? Ha! ha! ha! A snail might as well try
                  to catch a hare. No, you've thought better of it, and are hauling your wind. Well
                  best be satisfied—you've got one prize, at all events. Junot's a d——d poltroon,
                  and he merits his fate."</p>
               <p>Thus speaking, Seymour turned away his head, for it was clear that the cruiser had
                  given up the chase, and directed his attention to his own vessel, resolving, to
                  keep her on her present course, to make assurance doubly sure, till nightfall. He
                  saw no more of the cruiser, and the next morning he shaped his course to Aracati,
                  on the coast of Brazil, whither he was bound; the destination of the unlucky
                  Dolphin having been to Trinidad de Cuba.</p>

                  <p>The departure of the young midshipman on his first voyage to sea—The
                     peculiarities of Mr. Mordant's views regarding slave dealing on the coast of
                     Africa.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN a small but neatly furnished parlor, in a cottage, situated on the confines of
                  Jersey City, of very moderate pretensions, although the tastefully trimmed garden,
                  and the arrangement of everthing connected with the household, exterior and
                  interior, marks it to be the abode of a person whose means are at least sufficient
                  to maintain an appearance of respectability, and even to make some faint efforts
                  towards elegance and luxury, are seated a lady—a little past the middle age—and a
                  youth of some fifteen or sixteen years. The countenance of the lady is care-worn
                  and her features wear an expression of melancholy and of suffering; but, evidently
                  suffering of the mind rather than of the body; for she betrays no symptoms of
                  ill-health, save the langour which the fretting of a "mind diseased" has imparted
                  to her frame.</p>
               <p>The youth is attired in the uniform of a midshipman of the United States navy—and
                  notwithstanding the regret at the idea of parting from his home, which all his
                  bright hopes and anticipations cannot entirely banish, he evidently looks with
                  pride upon his gay attire, and feels within his heart the buoyancy of spirit which
                  all boys feel when first about to go forth into the world and fight the battle of
                  life. A twinge of conscience may now and then arise and remind him that he is
                  wrong in feeling thus elated, when she who watched over his infancy and childhood
                  is so sorrowful at the thoughts of the parting that is about to take place; but
                  the remonstrance of the monitor, conscience, is forgotten as soon as listened to,
                  and bright visions of the future banish all regretful reflections as soon as
                  formed; all is <foreign xml:lang="FRA">couleur de rose</foreign> to the boy's
                  mental vision, and unheard of fame and glory, he fancies, await him in the gallant
                  profession into which he is about to enter.</p>
               <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7191-00000066"/>
               <p>The lady and the youth are Mrs. Miller and her son Thomas—the latter of whom the
                  reader will recollect we have heretofore alluded to, as studying for the naval
                  profession.</p>
               <p>"Are all my traps packed, mother?" asks the lad. "Bridget must have everything
                  ready to-night; because you know I leave for Norfolk the first thing in the
                  morning, and to-night I must go over to New York and see Uncle Mordant."</p>
               <p>"Everything is ready, my dear," replies the widow. "I have packed everything with
                  my own hands. Your uncle has been very kind, and has provided you with a complete
                  outfit, and I have added everything I can think of that can possibly tend to your
                  comfort. I have arranged your clothing properly, and locked up your trunks, and
                  here (handing the youth a bunch of keys), here are the keys. Take care of them,
                  Tom; and now, my boy, there is one thing I have kept out. It is the last thing
                  your mother presents you with—I give you this pocket Bible, Tom, and beg you will
                  read it whenever you have an opportunity. I do not say every day, my boy. I know
                  were you to promise me that, now, in good faith, the promise would be
                  broken—perhaps often necessarily broken—and I do not wish to bind you to promises
                  that are difficult to keep; but read it now and then, as often as you can, and
                  when you read it think of her who gave it you, and who would wish you to consider
                  it as her parting and most precious gift. Open the title page, my dear, I have
                  written a verse there—four simple lines only—but I trust when your eye lights upon
                  them however far away you may be, you will think of the writer—for, Tom, I much
                  fear you are my only earthly solace now," (and a tear bedewed the widow's eye, and
                  she sighed deeply, as her thoughts reverted to the memory of her lost
                  daughter.)</p>
               <p>The boy opened, the book, and glanced over the following lines:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Remember her who gave you this,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"I will, dear mother, I will," said the boy, and springing from his seat, he threw
                  his arm around his mothers peck, and kissed her cheek. The embrace was returned,
                  and the youth resumed:</p>
               <p>"But, mother, I hope it will be a long, long time before the event mentioned in
                  the last line comes to pass. You are not an old woman, mother, and I hope to be a
                  captain, and have a ship of my own to command before you die; and then, mother, we
                  do not know that poor Jane is dead. She may return, and you will be happy
                  again."</p>
               <p>"Ah, no, Tom, I fear she will never return. Even if she lives, perhaps, it were
                  better she did not—and yet—what am I saying? Better she did not! no, no, poor
                  child—were she steeped in shame—if all the world should forsake her, she should
                  find a mother's home to shelter her—a mother's heart to receive her; yes, and
                  without a word of reproach."</p>
               <p>The widow wiped away the tears which had gushed to her eyes, and after a few
                  moments' silence, during which she endeavored to compose her agitated feelings,
                  she said, addressing her son:</p>
               <p>"Tom, you had better go over to New York as soon as possible, dear, because I
                  should like you to be home early. Your last evening at home, for a long time at
                  any rate, must be spent with your mother, my boy."</p>
               <p>"It's now half-past three," said the boy, looking at his new gold watch, a present
                  from his uncle. "Uncle Mordant goes home from the city at four. So I shall just be
                  in time to meet him at —— Place. I shall be back by eight o'clock, mother."</p>
               <p>"Do, my boy; don't be later," replied the widow, and the lad slipped on his
                  overcoat, placed his cap on his head, and started off in the direction of the
                  Jersey City ferry, and Mrs. Miller, in order to occupy her mind till his return,
                  set to work thinking whether there was anything in her power to provide, that she
                  had not already provided, which would add to her son's comfort or pleasure during
                  his voyage.</p>
               <p>In the course of an hour, Thomas Miller had reached his uncle's mansion; the
                  merchant had not returned from the city but he was expected every moment, and the
                  youth was asked into the parlor where his aunt Mordant and his cousins were
                  seated. Tom was a fine handsome lad, and was rather a favorite with his cousins;
                  he had always been so, although they disliked his sister. The reason, however, was
                  evident Jane was a much finer-looking and handsomer girl than either Mary or Sarah
                  Mordant, and the very cause which led the young ladies to envy and dislike her,
                  led them to admire the youth. He was some years younger than they were, and he had
                  always been fondled and petted by them. He was complimented upon his appearance in
                  his uniform, and each of the young ladies, and their mother likewise, presented
                  him with a<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7191-00000067"/> valuable gift by way of a
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">souvenir.</foreign> Before he had been seated many
                  minutes, Mr. Mordant arrived home and cordially welcomed his nephew, whom, as we
                  have said, he had fitted out at his own expense, perhaps, as a set-off against his
                  short-comings, as regarded the other members of the Miller family. Who shall say?
                  At all events, the merchant shook the boy heartily by the hand, and said:</p>
               <p>"Why, I declare, Tom! you look quite bravely in your uniform. I hope I shall live
                  to see you a commodore, boy. Pity now, there isn't some trouble with Uncle Sam,
                  somewhere or other, so that you might have ah opportunity to distinguish
                  yourself—isn't it? However, you'll get on well enough, I warrant, I know Captain
                  P——, of the U. S. ship G——, intimately and I have written to him concerning you.
                  You will have a good berth on board, my boy, I have no doubt, and I hope you will
                  succeed in your profession, and become not only a comfort to your mother, but an
                  honor to the family; come, Mary, my love," turning to his daughter, "is dinner
                  ready? you'll dine with us to-day, Tom?" he added, again addressing the lad.</p>
               <p>"I should like to get home again as soon as possible," replied Tom, "my mother
                  expressly desires me to spend my last evening ashore, with her."</p>
               <p>"And so you shall—so you shall—you shall go home as soon as dinner is over; come,
                  offer your arm to your cousin Mary," and the merchant and his wife led the way
                  into the dining-room.</p>
               <p>"Fill your glass, Tom—which will you have, Sherry or Madeira?" said Mr. Mordant,
                  pushing the decanters towards his nephew: "I wish you happiness, health, and
                  success," and he emptied his own glass, adding—" and now, my boy, you can drink
                  the toast to yourself."</p>
               <p>"By-the-by, Uncle," said Tom, "your letter did hot mention the destination of the
                  sloop-of-War. If you know yourself, I should like to know whither I am bound."</p>
               <p>"To Pernambuco, I believe, Tom; and if I recollect aright, the G—— will relieve
                  some vessel now on that station, and will then wait for orders from the commodore
                  on the station."</p>
               <p>"I did make some inquiries," replied the lad, "but no one seemed to know anything
                  about it; still I saw a paragraph in the paper saying that a U. S. ship was going
                  to be despatched to the coast of Africa—I suppose to look after the slave trade.
                  Now, you were saying that it was a pity there was no chance of a dust with anybody
                  just now. It strikes me that the coast offers the best chance. Suppose by good
                  luck I should go there, and we should capture some slave ships; you know that
                  would be something in the way of practice; at all events, there seems nothing else
                  likely to turn up in the way of fighting just now; unless, indeed, we were to get
                  into a row with Spain about the Island of Cuba."</p>
               <p>"You may, perhaps, be ordered to the coast of Africa, Tom; but I think not; and,
                  for my part, if I were you, I would care little about going there; though, of
                  course, you must go, if you are ordered. It always seems to me poor, pitiful work,
                  that hunting after slavers—a sort of spy system, beneath the dignity of the
                  national service."</p>
               <p>"But you surely don't approve of the slave trade, sir?" continued the lad; "I
                  always believed you to be an abolitionist."</p>
               <p>"And so I am, Tom; but I think this hunting up the slave ships on the coast of
                  Africa is fraught with misery and death to the negroes. While a market can be
                  found for the sale of negroes, and while the sale continues as profitable as it is
                  now, there will be found persons bold enough to venture into the trade. If the
                  trade were legal, as it once was, and could be carried on openly, more care would
                  be taken of the slaves imported from Africa, and more roomy vessels provided for
                  them, ten times over, than are now provided for emigrants who cross the Atlantic
                  from Europe. As it is, they are crowded into small, fleet vessels, cramped for
                  room and for air, and they die off in great numbers. The government of England,
                  and that off America, too, are answerable for this evil; for whereas, negroes
                  would fall in value, were the trade open and any quantity easily imported, now the
                  individual price of the surviving negroes is enhanced in the market, according to
                  the mortality that has prevailed amongst them, during their passage across the
                  ocean. The dealers still make money, while the government compels them to make it
                  at the expense of the blood of the negroes."</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant had got quite excited while speaking, and Tom smilingly remarked—</p>
               <p>"Why, sir, if they were to hear you speak thus in an abolitionist meeting, they
                  would think you had changed your sentiments and gone bodily over to the other
                  side."</p>
               <p>"I do get a little excited when I think of the miseries the poor negroes-suffer,
                  through the ill-advised endeavors to curb the traffic in slaves; still, I am an
                  abolitionist for all that—<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7191-00000068"/> only, I
                  would leave the evil of slavery to work its own reformation."</p>
               <p>"By rendering it easy for any number to be imported and sold without restraint or
                  difficulty," said Tom, laughing.</p>
               <p>"It is a matter that you do not understand, and which I cannot properly explain,"
                  said Mr. Mordant, testily, and Tom, fearing to offend his uncle, changed the
                  subject of conversation.</p>
               <p>Dinner over, Tom prepared to go home. He bade farewell to his aunt and cousins,
                  shook his uncle's hand, and received from him a goodly roll of bank notes, as a
                  parting present, and hastened to return to his mother's cottage in Jersey
                  City.</p>
               <p>The evening was spent by the mother and son together in earnest conversation, and
                  it was far into the night when they retired. In the morning, at an early hour, Tom
                  arose; the widow was already up—for she had not undressed herself, but had lain
                  down on the couch in her bed-room. Soon the carriage was at the door, and the
                  luggage placed within it—there were more kisses, reiterated promises—still more
                  last words—the driver smacked his whip—the carriage rolled rapidly away towards
                  the railroad station—and the widow Miller, still gazing upon the departing
                  vehicle, was left alone. A sharp pang shot through her heart; she felt she was now
                  indeed solitary, in one sense, childless; for one child had gone she knew not
                  whither—she feared down into the grave—while the other would be separated from
                  her, perhaps for years.</p>

               <p>MERRILY onward, with a top-gallant breeze bearing her rapidly over the yielding
                  waters, and a sky above clear and serene as that which canopies the soil of Italy,
                  sped the Albatross, on her way towards her destined port in the Brazils. Merrily
                  onward, to outward seeming—the gallant bark, a thing of light, almost of life.
                  Cheerily across the billowy ocean, borne by the breeze, is heard—long after the
                  sun has sunk beneath the western horizon—the song of the mariners, as they sit on
                  the forecastle, mingling their rough voices in a rude, but—heard under these
                  circumstances—a not unmusical sea ditty; the dulcet tones of the violin and the
                  flute, not touched by the hands of artists, nor giving forth melody such as would
                  please the ears of musical connoisseurs—add depth and richness to the vocal
                  strains; for the rippling waters, parted by the swift keel of the vessel, unite in
                  the chorus, and the dying cadence melts slowly, faintly away in the gentle breeze.
                  Merrily onward, to outward seeming, for a successful voyage has been all but
                  accomplished, the dangers that threaten all illegal pursuits are passed, and a
                  rich harvest in silver and gold—the price of human flesh and blood awaits the
                  adventurers—merrily on, to outward seeming I but what a world of woe, of anguish
                  unutterable, is hidden in the dark hold of that gallant bark.</p>
               <p>Rude and savage—perhaps are the natures of its dusky occupants—stolid and sullen
                  their tempers—uncultivated and ignorant—inferior to the rest of the human race,
                  perchance, are the minds of the poor wretches who are imprisoned there; penned up
                  like cattle in the market place, but denied the free current of air, that the
                  beasts of the field are permitted to breathe, even there; their numbers at first
                  rapidly, then more slowly thinned by deaths, the dead bodies lying for hours
                  tossed to and fro amongst the living by the heaving of the vessel, as she dances,
                  seemingly so lightly and buoyantly over the billows, and dragged up and consigned
                  to the deep, each morning like so much carrion, without a prayer being read over
                  them—without a thought of compassion for their fate—nay, amidst the coarse, lewd
                  jokes of the crew. Rude, ignorant, savage, we repeat they may be—they are; but the
                  vilest animal that breathes, has its likes and attachments—to its young, to its
                  kind—to its native soil—to all amongst which it has been accustomed to live; and
                  have these poor untutored negroes no regrets! are they, ignorant and savage as
                  they are, yet still endowed with reason and with human feelings, of less account
                  in the eyes of their fellow men than the dumb beast of the field or forest! So
                  indeed would it seem; but a wail of human woe bursts forth continuously from
                  amongst that wretched herd, and though it fails to touch the hearts of the
                  monsters in human form, who hold them in chains and are about to barter them for
                  gold—it finds elsewhere a hearing, and will be responded to in curses upon the
                  heads of the ravishers and despoilers; perhaps not<pb n="130-131"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000069"/> yet—they may triumph in their wickedness and
                  cruelty for a time, but though it may be slow in coming, the hour of retribution
                  will arrive—and that most surely. Never yet, but in some way or other the wrongs
                  of the oppressed have been visited with double severity upon the oppressors.</p>
               <p>In the course of a few weeks the Albatross, with its living freight arrived safely
                  in the harbor of Aracati, and the negroes were quickly conveyed up the Sagaldo
                  river and disposed of to slave merchants who subsequently took them to Bahia,
                  Pernambuco, Maranham, and other large Brazilian cities, and easily and rapidly
                  again sold them at a large profit. Captain Seymour was well pleased as he surveyed
                  the heaps of gold that his adventure had brought, as it lay piled upon the cabin
                  table. The crew were called down one by one, and their wages paid and a douceur of
                  two hundred dollars presented to each in addition, and each was asked if he would
                  ship, for another voyage—after having been allowed a reasonable time on shore to
                  spend his ill-gotten wages, and to revel in the drunkenness and debaucheries
                  peculiar to seamen on the termination of a voyage. All agreed, for they were
                  pleased with the result of the voyage—and satisfied with the treatment they had
                  met with from the captain.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. Tolcroft, call the boy Frank down," said the captain to the chief
                  mate.</p>
               <p>Frank Martin made his appearance in the cabin.</p>
               <p>"Well, Frank," said Captain Seymour, "considering all things, my boy, we have had
                  a very prosperous voyage, and I am well satisfied. Your articles of indenture, I
                  find, guarantee you six dollars a mouth, besides providing for your board and
                  clothing. Here is the amount due you, and I have added twenty-five dollars, as a
                  present, out of my own pocket; I am well satisfied with your conduct. You will'
                  make a good seaman by-and-bye; and I shall interest myself with Mr. Mordant to
                  further your advancement."</p>
               <p>Frank thanked, the captain, and counted his money.</p>
               <p>"I suppose," continued Captain Seymour, you would like a fun on shore with the
                  rest for a day or two. This is Wednesday; Mr. Tolcroft fells me that everything is
                  in order on board. We shall sail on Saturday for Pernambuco. Tomorrow and Friday
                  you can have to yourself."</p>
               <p>"If you please, sir said the lad, "I should like to leave the Albatross, and go on
                  board some other of Mr. Mordant's vessels to serve out the remainder of my
                  time."</p>
               <p>"Why—what's the matter, boy? What fault do you find with the Albatross or her
                  Captain?" asked Seymour.</p>
               <p>"I have no fault to find with either, sir," responded Frank.</p>
               <p>"Why, then, do you wish to leave?"</p>
               <p>"When I joined the Albatross, I had no idea of the trade in which she was
                  engaged," said the boy, rather hesitatingly.</p>
               <p>"Oh! so you are troubled with scruples of conscience, are you?" replied the
                  captain, smiling ironically. "Well, let me think what's best to be done under
                  these circumstances. Mr. Tolcroft," addressing the mate, "I promised this youth a
                  couple of days' liberty on shore; but, since his conscience is so easily touched,
                  lie will undoubtedly be desirous of avoiding the scenes of license and debauchery
                  he will witness if he runs loose amongst his shipmates—so see that he does not
                  quit the vessel on any pretext. And you may as well give me back the money I have
                  paid you, my lad. Since you have no occasion to spend it, it will be safer in my
                  trust."</p>
               <p>"Please, sir, I think I have earned my wages, at least," diffidently replied the
                  lad; but his further speech was interrupted by the captain who said, sharply—</p>
               <p>"Place the money back again on the table, sir; and, since you are so exceedingly
                  conscientious, go on deck to your duty, and see that you attend to it strictly.
                  It's really a pleasure to have so scrupulous a youth on board the Albatross to
                  remind her captain of his duties. Mr. Tolcroft," he added, "see that this young

                  that on up account he quit the vessel You can go on deck, sir," addressing the
                  boy; and Frank Martin, rather crestfallen, ascended the companion ladder.</p>
               <p>"That boy must be looked after," said the captain to the mate, when the lad had
                  retired. "He'll make a good seaman by-and-bye—but I thought at the time it was a
                  foolish whim on the part of Mr. Mordant to put him on board the Albatross. Indeed,
                  had I riot felt satisfied that he knew more than it appears he did know, I would
                  not have taken him on board at all. Once here, however, here he must remain."</p>
               <p>"I'll keep a sharp eye on the youngster," said the mate.</p>
               <p>"Do so," replied the captain; "but don't be harsh with him. Probably by good
                  treatment we may bring him round. Harsh measures will only strengthen him in his
                  foolish notions."</p>
               <p>"I've known many such a lad, as had them 'ere scruples of conscience, as you call
                  'em, to tumble overboard <emph>accidentally</emph> on<pb n="132-133"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000070"/> a dark night," said the mate, leering horribly y
                  and giving vent to his accustomed chuckle, when he thought he had said a good
                  thing!</p>
               <p>The captain did not reply; and the conversation turned upon matters connected with
                  the ship.</p>
               <p>Frank had determined, if his remonstrance with the captain failed, to quit the
                  ship at all hazards, but in his eagerness he had overshot his mark, and he now
                  found himself in an awkward predicament—for, even if he managed to effect his
                  escape, what was he to do without clothing or money? In one regard, however, his
                  plan was facilitated, for neither the captain or mate thought he would venture to
                  make the attempt in his present position—and thus casting himself on shore in the
                  condition of a ship-wrecked seaman—and therefore, though he was not allowed to
                  leave the vessel, no very strict watch was kept over him during the day, though
                  one or other of the mates kept watch on deck at night.</p>
               <p>Frank saw that his chances were desperate—still he resolved to make the attempt.
                  On the Thursday not a chance occurred, but on the Friday he was sent over the side
                  to paint the white streak on the water line. The town of Aracati consists but of a
                  few hundred houses on the north side of a small bay; and the other shores are
                  covered with wood and thicket to the margin of the beach. The vessel lay at anchor
                  not more than a quarter of a mile distant from the wooded shores, and about a mile
                  from the town, with her stern towards it. The captain was sitting on a hen coop
                  beneath the awning on the quarter deck, on the larboard side, busily occupied in
                  reading. All the crew but the cook, and two of the mates, were ashore; and the two
                  latter were stretched at full length in the hammock nettings, on the same side the
                  deck as the captain, and lazily smoking their cigars. Consequently, Frank could
                  slip into the water from the starboard bow unperceived, and as he hoped reach the
                  shore by swimming, and penetrate into the woods before his flight was discovered.
                  He made an excuse to come oil deck, to reconnoitre and see that all was right; and
                  finding the captain and officers still in the same position, and the cook busily
                  employed in the galley, he again descended to the plank, and gently let himself
                  off into the water. He was unperceived, and had swam perhaps one hundred yards
                  before it was known that he had left the vessel's side; but unfortunately at this
                  moment the cook came to the side of the ship to draw a bucket of water for some
                  culinary purpose. He missed the lad from the plank, and casting his eyes toward
                  the shore, saw him at a distance boldly striking out for the shore. He immediately
                  gave the alarm, and the captain and mates were on their feet in an instant.</p>
               <p>"Curse the fellow," said the captain, stamping his foot with, vexation. "But he's
                  not far off, I'll spoil his sport yet. Hand me a musket, Mr. Allan."</p>
               <p>The second mate took one from the rack round the mainmast, which was always kept
                  full of muskets, pikes, and cutlasses when the vessel was in port, and handed it
                  to the captain.</p>
               <p>"Hilloa there!" shouted Captain Seymour to the boy, "come back here, you
                  scoundrel, come back, or I'll fire at you."</p>
               <p>Whether the boy heard his voice or not, the command was unheeded; he still swam
                  boldly, manfully on towards the shore.</p>
               <p>"Bang!" went the musket, and the ball whizzed through the air, striking the water
                  some distance astern of the swimmer, whence it bounded and rebounded, skipping
                  along past his ears.</p>
               <p>By —— I've missed him this time," said the captain, "hand me another musket,
                  Allan, and take one yourself; and you, too, Tolcroft—I'll show the young scoundrel
                  the penalty of breaking my orders. He'll never break any others."</p>
               <p>The boy had heard the report and the whiz of the ball as it bounded past him, and
                  sunk at last some yards in advance; he had momentarily turned his head, but only
                  to turn it back again and redouble his efforts to escape.</p>
               <p>"Now, Tolcroft and Allan, take good aim and steady. Fire!" shouted the captain,
                  and the three reports were simultaneously heard. Again the balls whistled through
                  the air; but Prank had, during the interval, placed several yards of greater
                  distance between himself and the vessel, and the balls touched the water at a
                  greater distance behind him than the single bullet had done before—again they
                  skipped and bounded over the surface, straight towards him, but they sank ere they
                  reached him.</p>
               <p>"Confound the useless things!" said the captain, throwing his musket
                  contemptuously to the deck—"lower a boat," he shouted, "by —— I'll have him yet,
                  dead or alive."</p>
               <p>But a boat was not so easily lowered; the pinnace and longboat were secured
                  amidships, ready for the ship's sailing on the following day—the jolly-boat was on
                  shore with the third<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7191-00000071"/> mate and the
                  captain's gig, the only remaining boat, had been hoisted on board and turned keel
                  up, for the purpose of being painted; the paint was not yet dry. Frank had been
                  employed upon it, and he had well calculated the difficulty there would be in
                  sending a boat after him.</p>
               <p>"D—n the paint!" shouted the captain, in reply to some remark of the mate's in
                  regard to it—"overboard with the boat, quick! we'll be able to catch the young
                  scamp before he reaches the shore:" and the 'boat was hoisted over the side as
                  quickly as possible; the captain himself assisting at the tackles. Both mates and
                  the captain sprang into it, and seized an oar a-piece, the captain using his
                  whale-boat fashion, to steer as well as to aid in propelling the boat.</p>
               <p>The chase was an exciting one. Frank had reached within a comparatively short
                  distance of the shore during the time that had been occupied in getting the gig
                  into the water; but his strength was Beginning to fail him—nevertheless he
                  strained every nerve—swiftly the boat cleft the smooth waters of the bay in
                  pursuit, and earnestly the pursuers bent to the oars, for there was excitement in
                  the chase; but their efforts were useless. When within one hundred yards or less
                  of the boy, the latter touched the shore, turned round, waved his hand as if in
                  exultation or derision, and disappeared in the woods.</p>
               <p>"Pull in, pull in—run the boat right upon the beach," cried the captain. "We may
                  catch him yet," and in a few minutes more the boat was on the shore, and the
                  captain and mates had sprung out and penetrated into the woods; but the boy was
                  lighter and more active than they. They found a difficulty in pushing through the
                  tangled weeds and brushwood, and soon gave up the search as useless, and returned
                  to the ship, wearied with their exertions.</p>
               <p>"By Heaven!" said Seymour, as he reached the vessel's deck, "the boy deserves to
                  escape for his courage; but his escape may be an awkward matter. I should have
                  liked to have caught him."</p>
               <p>"Or to have shot him," chuckled Tolcroft.</p>
               <p>Frank spent the night in the woods, sleeping amongst the branches of a lofty tree,
                  where he thought he would be secure from the attacks of wild beasts or venomous
                  reptiles—nor did he venture out until the evening of the following day, and then,
                  with the exception of one or two Brazilian coasters, the bay was devoid of
                  shipping. The Albatross had sailed for Pernambuco buco. Footsore and half
                  famished, he reached the town, and there he procured some simple refreshment and
                  the rest he so much needed in the hut of a negro, to whom he related his
                  adventures, as well as he could, for he knew but a few words of the broken patois
                  spoken by the black. However, he found no difficulty in getting a berth on board
                  one of the coasting crafts in the harbor, which was bound to Para—there he joined
                  another vessel, and worked his passage to Maranham, and thence he procured a berth
                  on regular wages to New Orleans.</p>
               <p>What little money was coming to him on his arrival at the latter port, together
                  with his advance money, he spent in such clothing as was necessary, and shipped on
                  board a cotton vessel bound to Liverpool.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Just at sunrise one fine morning, about three weeks after young Martin had sailed
                  for Liverpool, the captain of a fine vessel, the appearance of which would have
                  told at once, even to the least practised eye, that she was a ship of war, came on
                  deck, and addressing the officer of the watch, said: "Mr. Ross, let the watch keep
                  a sharp look out. We ought to sight the island of Barbadoes before 'seven
                  bells.'"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, sir," responded the officer, touching the peak of his cap with his
                  forefinger, and lowering the spy glass which for some time he had kept pointed
                  across the water to leeward. Having replied to his captain's command, and given
                  the necessary instructions to the men, he again raised the glass to his eye in the
                  same direction.</p>
               <p>"Our observations indicate that we are to leeward of the island, Mr. Ross," said
                  the captain to the young lieutenant; "I don't think you'll sight the land in that
                  direction."</p>
               <p>"It's not that I'm looking for, sir," replied the officer; "but since it grew
                  daylight, half an hour ago, I've seen a black speck thereaway to leeward, which I
                  can't make out properly. I first caught sight of it as I was sweeping the horison
                  with my glass at daybreak. I thought at first it was a rock; then that it was a
                  float of sea-weed; and then that it was a boat; but really, I can make nothing, at
                  all of it."</p>
               <p>The captain took the glass from his hands, and peered long and earnestly through
                  it himself.</p>
               <p>"I can't make it out," he said, at last. "As you say, it does look like a boat
                  sometimes, and yet, at other times, it looks like a mass of sea-weed. If I thought
                  it was really a boat I would bear down to it; but we have to beat to windward<pb
                     n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7191-00000072"/> ward to weather the island, and we
                  should lose so much ground. Here, Mr. Miller," he exclaimed, turning to the
                  midshipman of the watch, who was standing on the lee side of the deck, "your eyes
                  are younger than mine or Mr. Ross's either; take you the glass and see what you
                  can make of that object."</p>
               <p>The youth touched his cap, advanced, and took the glass from the captain. He
                  peered through it for some minutes, and then said: "It does not look like a boat,
                  sir, unless it is bottom up; but I think I can see some figures moving upon it. It
                  looks to me as if they were waving something or other for a signal of distress;
                  but the object is so distant and so small that I cannot properly make it out."</p>
               <p>"On deck, there!" shouted an old quarter-master, who, some time before the captain
                  had come on deck, had been sent aloft by the lieutenant with a spy glass, to see
                  if he could make anything out of the dark object.</p>
               <p>"Halloa! what is it?" answered the officer.</p>
               <p>"That dark object is a boat capsized, and two figures are clinging to it, sir,"
                  replied the seaman. "I could not make it out at first, but the sun is shining
                  right upon it now. They are waving something to attract our attention."</p>
               <p>"We'll run down toward the object, Mr. Ross," said the captain, "until we are near
                  enough to lower a boat, and then 'heave to;'" and the officer immediately gave the
                  necessary directions to trim the yards and alter the vessel's course.</p>
               <p>As the ship drew nearer, it became quite evident that it was indeed a boat,
                  floating keel upwards—the keel barely out of the water, borne down as it was by
                  the weight of two human beings, who were apparently lashed to the rudder stem—and
                  from the appearance of small pieces of wreck, and burnt and charred wood, and
                  masses of cotton burnt to a cinder, and floating heavily upon the water, it was
                  apparent that some sad catastrophe had occurred. It was immediately and correctly
                  surmised that a cotton ship had taken fire and burnt to the water's edge and sunk,
                  and that the hapless beings, to whom help was now arriving, were probably the sole
                  survivors of the crew.</p>
               <p>The sloop of war was "hove to," and a boat lowered and rapidly pulled towards the
                  poor creatures, and it shortly returned with a lad and a young woman, both of whom
                  were in such an exhausted state that they were unable to move or speak—a few hours
                  more of exposure, and all human aid would have availed naught, for the female was
                  already insensible.</p>
               <p>They were lifted gently aboard and carefully tended by the surgeon and his
                  assistants, and in a short time the youth had recovered sufficiently to tell his
                  story.</p>
               <p>The surgeon came on deck and reported the fact to the captain.</p>
               <p>"And the young woman?" said the captain inquiringly; "she is not past recovery, I
                  hope?"</p>
               <p>"No, I trust we shall be able to bring her round yet—indeed she already shows
                  symptoms of reviving; but, poor thing, she was all but gone when she was brought
                  on board."</p>
               <p>"I will see the lad directly," said the captain, "and hear his story. I suppose
                  the young woman was a passenger. Perhaps she was the captain's wife, poor
                  creature."</p>
               <p>"No, I don't think she is a married woman," replied the doctor; "at any rate, she
                  wears no wedding ring; but here is a locket, containing the portrait of a young
                  man, which was suspended by a blue ribbon to her neck—and I took this ring from
                  her finger. It is rather a curiosity," and the doctor handed the trinkets to the
                  captain, saying, "I must go down below again, and see how my patients are getting
                  on."</p>
               <p>The captain took the locket and ring in his hands, and slightly glanced at the
                  former, but the latter attracted more notice. He examined it curiously, and then
                  handed it to the lieutenant, remarking, "A quaint, curious device, that, Mr. Ross.
                  I never saw a ring like it before; but I must go below and see what the youth has
                  to say."</p>
               <p>The ring which the captain handed to the lieutenant was a plain circlet of gold,
                  with a massive setting, consisting of a star of small but pure pearls, and an
                  emerald heart in the centre, and the letter "J" was engraved inside. It was a
                  curiosity, and evidently of considerable value.</p>
               <p>The reader will scarcely require to be informed that the sloop-of-war was the U.S.
                  ship G——, Commander P——, on board of which young Miller had received an
                  appointment as midshipman. She had been to Pernambuco, and, after lying in the
                  harbor for some weeks, awaiting orders from the commodore, had received
                  instructions to sail for Havana, with despatches to the American man-of-war in
                  that harbor, which were subsequently to be sent to the United States Government;
                  and after delivering these to the commanding officer of the American ship, the G——
                  was ordered to proceed, as young Miller had anticipated, to the coast of
                  Africa.</p>
               <p>The captain descended below, and questioned the young lad<pb n="138-139"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000073"/> who had been picked up from the wreck, as to the
                  particulars of the disaster which had befallen him, and which had left so few yet
                  such sad traces behind.</p>
               <p>"What is your name, my man?" inquired the captain.</p>
               <p>"Frank Martin, sir," replied the youth.</p>
               <p>"And the name of the vessel, which, I presume, has been burnt?"</p>
               <p>"The Laurel, of Liverpool, loaded with cotton, from New Orleans. The vessel caught
                  fire ten days ago, off the Bahama islands, but a considerable distance, to the
                  southward and westward of them. We were not in sight of any land, and could get no
                  assistance. The fire burnt slowly for several days, and we had hopes of getting it
                  under; but at last it burst forth from the hold, and we found that any further
                  effort to save the vessel would be useless. We had barely time to get out the
                  boats; for in an hour after the fire had burst from the hatchways, the vessel and
                  rigging Were one sheet of living flame.</p>
               <p>"We had three boats, and they held the whole of the crew and a considerable
                  quantity of provisions, but they were sadly overloaded.</p>
               <p>"The night after we took to the boats a sudden gale arose, which lasted several
                  hours. The jolly boat, on board of which was the young woman you have saved,
                  together with myself and five others, was capsized, and all the others were
                  drowned. I managed to seize hold of the rudder of the boat, and seeing the young
                  woman struggling near me, I seized a portion of her clothing and dragged her
                  towards me, and succeeded in making both of us fast to the stern of the boat. In
                  the morning, when the gale moderated, no sign of the other boats was to be
                  seen—they were deeply loaded, for everybody had crowded into the larger boats. I
                  fear they are lost. Since yesterday morning we have been tossing to and fro,
                  immersed to our shoulders in water, and the upper portions of our bodies exposed
                  to the sun during the day and to the cold at night. I saw the ship this morning,
                  and attempted to call the attention of the young woman to it; but she was even
                  then insensible. I thought she was dead, but the doctor says she is reviving. I
                  managed to wave my neckerchief, as well as I could with my stiffened arms, and at
                  last had the happiness of seeing that we had been observed, and that the course of
                  the vessel was altered, and she was bearing down towards us."</p>
               <p>At this moment the surgeon approached and said, "I am happy to inform you that
                  your companion in peril is out of danger, and will soon recover. I have left her
                  sleeping soundly. Who is she—a passenger, I presume?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, she was the stewardess of the Laurel; her name is Charlotte—at least so
                  she was called—but I never heard her surname."</p>
               <p>"The stewardess!" exclaimed the doctor; "dear me, I shouldn't have thought that.
                  From her appearance, I should take her to have been delicately nurtured, and her
                  hands show that she has certainly been unused to hard work."</p>
               <p>"Well, I suppose, my man," interrupted the captain, "you will have no objection to
                  enter your name on the ship's books, since you have boarded us in such a strange
                  manner; you will then draw your pay from this day. We shall probably be out a
                  twelve-month. The ship is bound to the coast of Africa. What say you?"</p>
               <p>Frank thought he might as well make a virtue of necessity, and therefore he
                  readily agreed to have his name enrolled among the crew, and thus the late cabin
                  boy of the slaver became a seaman on board a cruiser bound to aid in the
                  suppression of the slave trade; but as yet Frank, for certain reasons of his own,
                  kept his own counsel with regard to his having escaped from the Albatross, on the
                  coast of Brazil.</p>
               <p>With regard to the young female, there was no recourse but to take her to the
                  coast, on board the man-of-war, and to send her back to the United States by the
                  first ship that the G—— should meet with bound thither.</p>
               <p>She was very thankful for the kindness shown her by the officers of the ship; but
                  was very reserved—all that could be learnt from her was that her name was
                  Charlotte Herbert, and noticing this reserve, the captain and officers forbore to
                  question her.</p>
               <p>In the course of a few weeks the G—— made the African coast, and cruised along it
                  from Loando as far north as Cape Coast Castle, without meeting with any slavers,
                  and the captain, for the sake of varying the monotony of the cruise, resolved to
                  visit the islands, commencing at Fernando Po, and proceeding southward to St.
                  Thomas and Annabon.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The origin of the Mystery of the Rings.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>CAN it be possible that two rings have been manufactured of such a very peculiar
                  appearance?" asked Charles Mordant of himself, as he quitted the Widow Miller at
                  the depot of the Jersey City ferry, as mentioned in a preceding chapters. "It
                  maybe, nay, it must be the case. I am a fool to trouble myself about the
                  matter."</p>
               <p>To enable the reader to understand wherefore Charles Mordant had shown such a
                  degree of anxiety and apparent distrust and uneasiness when he observed the ring
                  alluded to on Mrs. Miller's finger, we must partially retrace our history. The
                  reader is aware that Charles Mordant was, at the period of his first introduction,
                  studying for the legal profession in Boston; but like those of a great many young
                  men of large expectations in the present day, and especially in the United States,
                  his studies were merely nominal For form's sake he attended chambers occasionally,
                  but the chief portion of his time was spent in the pursuit of pleasure, and we are
                  sorry to say that the pleasures in which Charles Mordant took delight were not of
                  the most orthodox character. To tell the truth he was a frequenter of fashionable
                  saloons, gambling houses, and every other resort of which dissipation and
                  immorality were the leading characteristics. Some six months prior to the date of
                  the opening of our story he had been on a visit to Philadelphia, and while there,
                  by some means or other, he had formed an intimacy with a young lady whose parents
                  belonged to the Society of Friends, and whose; name was Jeannette Dixon. On the
                  part of the young man the intimacy had been commenced merely for the purpose of
                  creating some fresh excitement to refresh his jaded spirits. Jeannette Dixon was a
                  very pretty and interesting girl, and young Mordant had met her by, chance at the
                  house of a friend where she had been on a visit. He had paid the modest,
                  unassuming girl marked attention; and as he was a good-looking fellow enough—known
                  to be the prospective heir of great wealth, and supposed to be of good moral
                  character—and more particularly as the young woman had heretofore led a very
                  secluded life, and was now just of that age when the female heart is most
                  susceptible to the attractions of the opposite sex, she had been much flattered by
                  the preference shown towards her by young Mordant. She was shy and reserved at
                  first, but her very reserve, the fact that she kept her thoughts to herself,
                  rendered her more readily though secretly, susceptible to the young man's
                  assiduities and protestations of attachment. The result was, that what in the
                  first instance was merely a pleasurable, flattering sensation, causing her heart
                  to flutter, and her cheek to blush, at the thought of being the object of the
                  young man's especial notice and favor, rapidly ripened into a feeling of love.
                  Charles Mordant likewise began to discover that he felt very different sensations
                  with regard to the fair Quakeress, to those he had previously experienced when he
                  had thought fit to patronize, as he termed it, any young lady whom he could get to
                  listen to his flatteries. He began to feel that he could love Jeannette Dixon, at
                  least as much as he was capable of loving any one but himself, and that if she
                  were of a more wealthy family, that he could be content to make her his wife; but
                  then her parents, though highly respectable, were comparatively poor, and the idea
                  of marriage was not to be thought of in earnest—though he did not hesitate to
                  speak of it to Jeannette, who otherwise would have steeled her heart to all his
                  protestations of love—or, at least, would have striven to do so, and if she could
                  not, would have resisted the temptations that beset her.</p>
               <p>Such a rigid watch is kept over their children by the Quakers, that it was
                  impossible that this attachment on the part of their daughter and young Mordant
                  could long be kept a secret from Jeannette's parents, and she was warned by her
                  father and mother both of the difference in the worldly position of her lover and
                  herself, and also told that they would not give <emph>their</emph> consent to
                  their daughter's marriage with any one but a member of their own peculiar sect.
                  Jeannette told Charles of this determination on the part of her parents, but he
                  merely laughed at the prejudices of the old folks, as he called them, and thereby
                  drew upon himself a severe rebuke from his fair and confiding friend. He, however,
                  soon soothed her indignation; told her he would marry her at last, even if he had
                  to wait for years—and left her more than ever assured of his love.</p>
               <p>Thus matters continued for several weeks. Meanwhile Mr. Dixon had written to Mr.
                  Mordant, stating in plain terms the connection that existed between the young man
                  and his<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7191-00000075"/> daughter, and his own
                  objections to the marriage as well on the score of difference of religious
                  persuasion as of worldly position. He received a letter from Mr. Mordant thanking
                  him for the information—agreeing perfectly with his views—stating that he had
                  other intentions with regard to his son, and that he never would give his consent
                  to Ins union with Miss Dixon. The old merchant also wrote to his son, expressing
                  the same sentiments, and threatening him with disinheritance if he refused to act
                  in accordance with his wishes. Mr. Dixon showed the letter to his daughter, and
                  endeavored to reason her out of her misplaced attachment; but, as may well be
                  imagined, in vain. She felt confident that Charles loved her; had he not told; her
                  so, and added that he would sooner have her for his wife, and earn his own living
                  by the sweat of his brow, than wed another and revel in countless riches, and
                  after that could she doubt him? she asked herself, and her heart responded—no.</p>
               <p>Charles replied to his father's letter, saying that it was merely a harmless
                  flirtation that he was indulging in; that he had, no thoughts of anything serious,
                  and that the girl and her parents must be very simple to imagine such a thing; to
                  which Mr. Mordant replied that he was glad to hear it was so, at the same time
                  jokingly reminding his son that the moth that plays too near the candle can
                  scarcely avoid being singed at last.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding every precaution on the part of her parents, Charles and Jeannette
                  managed to contrive stolen interviews, and at last he told her in reply to her
                  questioning, that his father would not consent to their marriage; that he was
                  going to Boston to resume his studies, and urged her consent to a private wedding.
                  The poor girl was strongly attached to him; she dreaded his leaving her, and she
                  had already been taunted by her female friends, with regard to her infatuation, as
                  they were pleased to term it, to such a degree that her life had been rendered
                  wretched. In an evil moment she consented. She believed that he was privately
                  married by a minister of the Baptist church, when in fact only a mock ceremony
                  was, performed by a graceless companion and tool of the young and abandoned
                  spendthrift, and Jeannette Dixon quitted her happy home and followed her supposed
                  husband to Boston. Mr. Dixon wrote again to Mr. Mordant, when he discovered the
                  flight of his daughter, and the merchant wrote and demanded an explanation of his
                  sop. The young man denied any knowledge of the girl, and even said that he
                  believed her to be a worthless creature, whom it were folly for him to trouble
                  himself about farther, and thus the poor distressed parents were left quite unable
                  to discover what had become of their child. Jeannette wished to write to her
                  parents; but she was forbidden by Charles, who said that he would see his mother
                  in a short time and by her means, obtain his father's forgiveness; but, were the
                  marriage made known now, his father would in his anger, act up to his threats; and
                  fearful of injuring her supposed husband's future prospects, poor Jeannette was
                  led reluctantly to maintain secrecy.</p>
               <p>For some time Charles, who was, really much attached to the young woman, treated
                  her with the utmost kindness and attention, and lavished innumerable presents upon
                  her. One day he chanced to step into a jeweler's shop, with the intention of
                  making some purchases, when his notice was attracted towards a ring of peculiar
                  form and great value and beauty. He purchased it and gave it to Jeannette; but the
                  circlet being too large for her finger, he brought it back the next day to have it
                  altered and to have the letter "J" engraved inside.</p>
               <p>At this time, Captain Seymour, who had just returned from a successful voyage, had
                  gone on a short visit to Boston, and as the reader is aware, he had been
                  fascinated in New York by the charms of Mrs. Miller's pretty and interesting
                  daughter. He was desirous of making her a present of some jewelry, and by chance,
                  he wandered into the some jeweller's store that had in the morning been visited by
                  Charles Mordant. He made such purchases as he thought requisite, and was on the
                  point of leaving the store when he said:</p>
               <p>"Bey-the-bye, I should like to look at some finger-rings—I want to buy one for a
                  lady."</p>
               <p>The jeweller handed him a tray stored with the articles in question. "I don't like
                  any of these," said he, "they are all too common; can't you make me something out
                  of the way—entirely new?"</p>
               <p>A sudden thought struck the jeweller. He would make him a ring similar to that
                  which had been purchased by Charles Mordant. It was a singular pattern, and it was
                  unlikely that there were many like it to be found. He described it to his
                  customer, who gave him an order to make it as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>"By-the-bye," said Seymour, "engrave the letter "J" on it."</p>
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7191-00000076"/>
               <p>The jeweller looked surprised, but promised to fulfil the order as soon as
                  possible.</p>
               <p>He turned to his partner, however, as soon as Seymour had left the store, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"It is a strange coincidence. You recollect about two years ago, we made a ring
                  for a lady who came to the store in deep mourning accompanied by a gentleman—I
                  think they were English, but I forget their names—it was an emerald heart
                  encircled with diamonds, and the letter 'J' was engraved upon it. I made another
                  ring set with similar stones, and yesterday a gentleman purchased it, and to-day
                  he called for the purpose of having it altered, and the letter 'J' engraved upon
                  it. That gentleman who has just gone out, wanted a ring of some novel and strange
                  pattern, and I described the emerald and pearl rings to him. He has ordered one,
                  and strange enough, has requested it to be similarly engraved."</p>
               <p>"It is strange," replied the person addressed.</p>
               <p>"I shall make two while I am about it," said the first speaker; "since I had such
                  luck in selling the three, I may yet sell another—as a rare specimen—you know—they
                  seem to take people's fancy, as rarities, but if the pattern were to become
                  common; they would be a drug in the market."</p>
               <p>The jeweller, unknown to either Charles Mordant or Seymour, did make two, and thus
                  Charles and the Captain were both provided, leaving one still in the
                  manufacturer's possession.</p>
               <p>William Martin, who the reader will recollect we mentioned heretofore as studying
                  law with a gentleman in Augusta (Me.), had about this time come on to Boston to
                  complete his studies. The young man was at this time paying his addresses to a
                  young lady in Augusta, and it naturally enough occurred to him to send her a
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">souvenir</foreign> of his love and constancy. A few
                  weeks after Captain Seymour had purchased his ring, William Martin called at the
                  jeweller's store in question, and asked to look at some rings and other articles
                  of jewelry, and he was shown the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">fac simile</foreign> of
                  the rings already spoken of.</p>
               <p>"That will please Jessica," he thought to himself. "It will be quite a curiosity
                  down in Maine;" and he immediately purchased it of the jeweller. "By-the-bye,"
                  said he, as he was pulling out his purse to pay for the trinket, "I wish you would
                  get the letter 'J' engraved upon it for me."</p>
               <p>The jeweller was astonished. He thought at first that he must be dreaming. The
                  letter "J" began to assume a magical appearance in his eyes; but he promised to
                  get the letter engraved.</p>
               <p>"Very strange," he muttered to himself, as the young man left the store; "very
                  strange, indeed. I don't half like it, somehow or other. I won't make any more of
                  those rings."</p>
               <p>It was a similar ring to that which Mrs. Miller wore that Charles Mordant had
                  given to Jeannette Dixon; and Captain Seymour had given the ring he had purchased

               <p>In the following chapter the reader will perceive that Charles Mordant had ample
                  reason to feel the uneasiness he could scarcely dissemble, when he saw the emerald

               <p>BETWEEN the City Hall and Wall street, the great financial centre of the city of
                  New York—although, of late years, the Commercial Metropolis of the Western world
                  has stretched itself far, far along towards the confines of the Island of
                  Manhattan—and between Broadway, the great centre throughfare of this ever-crowded,
                  ever-increasing emporium of commerce, and William street—leading towards the
                  entrance of the sea, commonly known by the misnomer of the East River—is a dingy
                  neighborhood, amidst a labyrinth of dingy narrow streets; the sidewalks narrow
                  enough at the best, eternally choked up with goods, carted down for the purpose of
                  storage, or set out ready for exportation to air parts of this great Union—aye,
                  and to all parts of the world beyond; or else, less pardonably lumbered with empty
                  packing cases, which the passer by imagines, perchance, to be full, and which,
                  regardless of the bylaws of the city, and regardless of the rights of the foot
                  passenger, are daily paraded by the owners of the rubbish, to be taken in by their
                  clerks at night merely for the gratification of a ridiculous vanity—and to make
                  the world of passengers believe they are doing an immense deal more business than
                  really falls to their share.</p>
               <p>In this same neighborhood are numerous rattle trap buildings—the exterior of
                  which, perhaps, may be substantial<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7191-00000077"/>
                  enough, though they seldom hare any other outward recommendation, while the
                  interiors are in every imaginable process of dilapidation; stairs worn into holes
                  by continual treading; plaster fallen away; dirty passages—with ruinous banisters
                  deluding the unwary visitor with a promise of support, which lie would be luckless
                  indeed to trust to, out of which rooms open displaying floors covered with the
                  introdden dust of many years; and windows which, since the day the glazier
                  completed his work, have never known the luxury of clean water; windows from which
                  the dim light that is enabled to find its way into those dark and narrow streets,
                  is half excluded by the neglect of the occupants of the rooms, and in the corners
                  of which spiders innumerable have taken up their abode, feeling secure, in
                  consequence of long immunity from the fatal broom of the housewife—the furniture
                  is scant and dreary as can well be—bare deal stands, furnished with compartments
                  filled with little pieces of lead-colored metal, before each of which stands a
                  coatless individual who is busily occupied in removing the pieces of metal the
                  stands, and placing them one by one in regular order in a curiously formed metal
                  case he holds in his left hand. A strange click, click, click, as the several
                  pieces of metal are fixed in the case or "stick," resounds through the room—the
                  floor of which is littered with pieces of dirty manuscript and long slips of
                  printed paper; yet, from these dingy places, daily, weekly, and at all times,
                  printed by day, week day and Sabbath day alike, as may; be known by the incessant
                  rumbling of the mighty steam engines and printing presses buried in subterranean
                  caverns beneath the streets, like so many volcanoes in a state of perpetual
                  proximity to eruption, issue the thousands and tens of thousands of newspapers,
                  magazines, periodicals, circulars, and books of all descriptions, which well
                  excuse the boasts of Americans that the people of this, country are the greatest
                  readers, and the best patrons of the gray goose quill in the wide world.</p>
               <p>It is from the dingy, murky abodes that we have described, that are constantly
                  being sent forth the clean, clear, well-folded pages of printed matter, which form
                  the daily intellectual banquet of hundreds of thousands of human beings—who, as
                  they read the handsomely printed, well bound volume, little dream of the dreary
                  passage through which its pages have progressed, since the thoughts expressed by
                  the printed letters came from the brain of the author, and were jotted down, as
                  they struggled into life, on the blotted manuscript. And in this neighborhood,
                  likewise, are numerous offices, scarcely if at all more comfortable than those
                  tenanted by the printers, occupied by a class of men whom it has long been a
                  standing joke to designate as "necessary evils" in a civilized community—the class
                  of lawyers; necessary for what? because the incessant competition in business, and
                  the continual desire amongst civilized men to outstrip their neighbors in the race
                  for wealth, and fame, and power, leads them to fraud and chicanery—foreign to
                  human nature in its uncultivated and less corrupted condition, and compels the
                  intervention of the man of law to settle those disputes which in ruder times were
                  settled by a resort to physical strife. These men herd thick as bees in this
                  vicinity; lawyers of every calibre; men versed in legal lore; of extensive
                  knowledge, and of high attainments—men of such established integrity, and such
                  acknowledged talent, that the finger of envy and malevolence may point at them in
                  vain—men whom to know is to honor and esteem. And here those men herd likewise,
                  who habitually prostitute the little legal knowledge they possess—and who use the
                  means of sewing discord and hatching mischief which their profession gives to
                  them, for the vilest purposes, if a pecuniary reward is held out to them as an
                  inducement to the practice of villany, such as they cannot hope to reap in an
                  honest manner.</p>
               <p>It was towards this neighborhood that, as we mentioned in a former chapter,
                  Charles Mordant had directed his steps on the occasion of his visit to the lawyer,
                  whom we have chosen—having an wholesome fear of the law of libel before our eyes,
                  and knowing that the nearer the truth the greater is the libel held to be—to
                  designate by the name of Harvey.</p>
               <p>The reader will recall to his recollection the circumstances of the younger
                  Mordant's previous, Visit, for the purpose of raising money on the security of his
                  future expectations, to meet the demands upon his purse, created by his reckless
                  extravagance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harvey had discovered, by a close examination into some private documents
                  belonging to the elder Mordant, which Charles had brought him, that there was
                  something wrong with regard to a certain property in New Jersey, held by the
                  merchant, which had formerly belonged to Mr. Miller. True, the property had been
                  purchased from a Dutchman, although at a mere nominal price, quite in a regular
                  and business-like<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7191-00000078"/> manner; but the
                  lawyer, do all he could, was unable to discover by what right the Dutchman had
                  sold it, or by virtue of what original Dutch claim it had passed from the
                  possession of Mr. Miller into that of Mr. Peyster, who farmed a small property of
                  his own, somewhere in its neighborhood, and who had emigrated from Amsterdam some
                  fifty years before, when a mere child.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harvey had made a good deal of money out of Mr. Mordant in a fair and
                  legitimate way, as legal matters go, and now he did not see any just cause or
                  impediment to his making a little more, in the way of "black mail," as it is
                  called by vulgar, little-minded individuals, who cannot understand the delicate
                  operations of speculators upon other people's finances—especially if he could
                  prove the merchant guilty of underhanded and fraudulent dealings with a simple and
                  unprotected widow woman, and that widow woman his own near relative, and could
                  frighten him by threats of exposure; therefore, when the young spendthrift,
                  Charles, called, he had put off until the following Monday the further
                  consideration of the young man's business, and had determined, meanwhile, to hunt
                  up the said Dutch farmer, Mr. Peyster.</p>
               <p>This was no very difficult matter, for the plodding old Dutchman did not reside
                  more than thirty miles from New York, in the neighboring State of New Jersey; and
                  Mr. Harvey took the railroad cars to a certain village where was located the
                  nearest depot to the farm, and then, hiring a wagon from the landlord of the
                  village hotel, he set off by himself towards the residence of the farmer, whom he
                  found guiding the plow with his own hands across the furrows of one of his own
                  fields.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, sir; good morning!" said Mr. Harvey, who had dismounted from the
                  vehicle, and making the reins fast, had proceeded across the field to where the
                  Dutchman and his son were employed.</p>
               <p>"Have I the pleasure of seeing Mr. Peyster?"</p>
               <p>"Mine name is Peyster," said the Dutchman, surlily, and without discontinuing his
                  labor; "but I don't know what for it should be any bleasure to you to know
                  dat—w-hit, g'lang!" shouting to the horses that were yoked to the plow, and
                  cracking his whip, leaving the lawyer in some doubt whether the expression applied
                  to himself or to the horses.</p>
               <p>"But, my good sir, if I should happen to have business with you that would put
                  money in your pocket and mine, then, perhaps, it would be a mutual pleasure for us
                  to hold conversation together."</p>
               <p>"So! I likes de money—bus'ness mit me, eh? veil, vat business has you mit me dat
                  shall be bleasant to us both?"</p>
               <p>"My dear sir, I am a lawyer, and——"</p>
               <p>"Der tuyfil you is!" interrupted the farmer, "den let me tell you I vants no
                  business nor no bleasure mit you neider, mynheer—w-hit, gee whoo! vat der tuyfil
                  is de matter mit de horses?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Harvey saw at a glance that the Dutchman was a rude, ignorant clown, yet he
                  judged him to be a shrewd fellow withal, with whom it was no use to beat about the
                  bush, so he resolved to come at once to the purpose of his visit.</p>
               <p>"I called respecting a little property near your farm—adjoining it, I fancy—which
                  you sold some time ago to Mr. Mordant of New York. Let me see; how long ago was
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"Vat ish dat to you? I sold it, and I got de money and I spends him—dat is
                  all."</p>
               <p>"Not quite ail, my good friend, since I have reason to believe the property was
                  not yours to sell, and the rightful owner is about to reclaim it."</p>
               <p>"It vas not mine to sell!" exclaimed the Dutchman, "who tells you dat? If he vas
                  not, I've not got him now. Mr. Mordant has got him, and dey must go and ask him—I
                  has'nt got noting to do mit him."</p>
               <p>"But it is upon you that the claim will be made by Mr. Mordant for the money he
                  paid you for the property, unless you have the title deeds to prove your claim
                  over that of the late Mr. Miller."</p>
               <p>"I knows noting of de late Mr. Miller—I never see him—Mr. Mordant told me de
                  estate vas mine, and I sold him for less as he was wort, too—it is no business of
                  mine."</p>
               <p>"You will find to your cost that it is business of yours, and very serious
                  business, too, my good sir, unless you can prove that you really had a claim upon
                  it, or, indeed, unless you were deceived, overreached by Mr. Mordant."</p>
               <p>"Vy, vat vill dey do mit me—take mine varm from me?" said the Dutchman, evidently
                  growing alarmed. Suppose I vas deceived—vat else you call it—by Mr. Mordant, vot
                  den?"</p>
               <p>"Then, perhaps, in consideration of your ignorance, the odium would fall upon the
                  merchant, and he <emph>might</emph>—mind I do not say he <emph>would</emph>—be
                  compelled to make restitution to the real proprietors out of his <emph>own</emph>
                  pocket."</p>
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7191-00000079"/>
               <p>"Vat can I do mit de matter?" asked the Dutchman, now stopping his team, beside
                  which the lawyer had hitherto walked, his feet sinking into the sandy, clayey soil
                  at every step he made.</p>
               <p>"Finish your furrow, and then hitch up your team to the gate for half an hour, and
                  step into the farm-house with me. I told you at first I wanted to talk matters
                  over with you, and perhaps to help you as well as myself to a way of getting a
                  little money."</p>
               <p>This the farmer agreed to; and the furrow completed, he hitched the team to the
                  gate, and led the way into the farmhouse.</p>
               <p>"Now," said Mr. Harvey, when he and his boorish companion were seated—"now, it is
                  very probable—indeed, I may say certain, that the prosecuting party will put this
                  matter into my hands. I shall in that case have to prosecute you as principal in,
                  and Mr. Mordant as accessary, towards the perpetration of a wicked and flagitious
                  fraud—one that will arouse the indignation of the whole community and cause the
                  utter ruin of you both; unless <emph>you,</emph> by divulging to me now, the means
                  by which Mr. Mordant induced you—<emph>ignorantly</emph>—you mark me! to suppose
                  the property to be yours, and to sell it to him for less than its value—enable me
                  to plead that ignorance in your behalf, in a court of justice. It will, let me
                  add, be useless to deny it; because, I tell you at once, I know all about the
                  matter."</p>
               <p>"Vat you come for, den—to ask me to tell you vat you know? Vat for you not go to
                  Mr. Mordant. I am a poor man—I have got no money to give you."</p>
               <p>"When I say, I know all about the matter, I mean that I am perfectly aware that
                  fraud has been committed by both you and Mr. Mordant; but I am willing to believe
                  that Mr. Mordant deceived you—took advantage of your ignorance, and that the crime
                  rests upon his shoulders."</p>
               <p>"So it does—so help mine Got, it does," exclaimed the farmer, now thoroughly
                  frightened. "I had notting to do mit it, but to take the monies he paid me—mine
                  Got, and spend him too. <foreign xml:lang="DUT">Dunder an Blitzen</foreign> I
                  spends every shent of him, long ago."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, my good friend; don't be alarmed. <emph>You,</emph> I tell you again,
                  if you conceal nothing from me have nothing to fear for yourself. Now, tell me,"
                  and the wily lawyer hitched his chair closer to the farmer and laid his hand
                  encouragingly upon his knee, "now tell me, my honest friend, how this little
                  affair was managed?"</p>
               <p>The Dutchman hemmed and coughed to clear his throat, and sat for some moments in a
                  brown study—seemingly endeavoring to recall the subject to his memory. At length
                  he exclaimed:—</p>
               <p>"I must take a smoke mit my pipe—mine Got! I can tink of noting till I have smoke
                  mit my pipe."</p>
               <p>"Smoke, by all means, my friend," said the lawyer, who, although annoyed at the
                  farmer's dilatoriuess and stupidity, knew he would gain nothing by crossing his
                  humor.</p>
               <p>The pipe was produced, filled and lighted, and patiently puffed for a fall quarter
                  of an hour before the ideas of the Dutchman began to brighten up. At last, he laid
                  it aside and commenced.</p>
               <p>"It might be ten years ago—and p'raps more longer as dat—Mr. Mordant comes to me
                  von day ven I was plowing on my farm, just as you came to-day, and he says:—</p>
               <p>"'Goot morning, Mynheer Peyster'—and I said, 'goot morning Mr. Mordant'—because I
                  knowd him a goot long time before—and he said 'I am glad to hear of your goot
                  fortune, Mynheer Peyster—that is a nice little property you have got.'</p>
               <p>"And I said, 'Vere is my property Mr. Mordant? You are joking mit me.' 'Cause den
                  I only rented the little farm I owns now.</p>
               <p>"'Vat!' lie cried; 'you doesn't know dat your great grand-fader, who came oat to
                  this country by order of the States General of the Nederlands, many years before
                  you was born, owned all dis nice property hereby, and you are the rightful heir to
                  it!"</p>
               <p>"'No, I tells him—and he says—' tink now Mynheer Peyster, tink whether you never
                  heard your fader, ven you vas a little boy in Amsterdam, speaking of his property
                  in America and lie put a piece of money in my hand and says, 'let's come into de
                  house, Mynheer Peyster, and talk matters over' jist as you said jist now: and I
                  walks into de house, as; I did mit you, and takes my pipe and lights him, and
                  begins to smoke and to tink."</p>
               <p>And thus reminded of his favorite indulgence, the Dutchman again took up his pipe
                  and commenced to smoke, and Mr. Harvey was compelled to wait until he again, laid
                  the pipe aside.</p>

               <p>"'At last,' he continued, I turned to Mr. Mordant and looked him in de face and
                  said—'I have been tinking over de matter.'</p>
               <p>"'And at what conclusion has you arrived?' he asked, putting anoder piece of money
                  into my hand, and I looked at de coin and said, '<emph>Yah</emph>—I tink I do
                  recollect someting of de kind.'</p>
               <p>"And he put his hand in his pocket and took out his purse, and said:</p>
               <p>"'Tink again my vriend—be sure of it,' and I said, looking at de purse,</p>
               <p>"'<foreign xml:lang="DUT">Dunner and blitzen!</foreign> I am sure of it now.'</p>
               <p>"'And it was in New Jersey,' said he, 'on a portion of the State that was formerly
                  subject to Holland—in fact it was in dis neighborhood,' and he pulled open de
                  strings of his purse.</p>
               <p>"'<emph>Yah!</emph>' I said, 'I recollect now it vas here.'</p>
               <p>"'You are <emph>sure?</emph>' he said, laying a bill on de table. 'Quite sure said
                  I, and I took up de bill and put it in mine pocket mid de rest ob de money.</p>
               <p>"And Mr. Mordant said, 'vat a shame it was dat de poor Dutchmen should be cheated
                  out of dere rights—and I said:</p>
               <p>"'<emph>Yah!</emph>' and Mr. Mordant went on.</p>
               <p>"'Suppose now I should happen to find dis old claim of yours—vould you sell me de
                  estate at a reasonable price.'"</p>
               <p>"'<emph>Yah,</emph>' said I, and he replied, 'good morning, Mynheer Peyster' and
                  vent avay, and I took up mine pipe and sat and smoked and counted the monies and
                  tought I vas in luck.</p>
               <p>"A week afterwards he came again, and brought mit him an old lawyer—who had a
                  dirty piece of parchment in his pocket, and dey said dat vas my claim, and asked
                  vould I sell it—and I said '<emph>Yah,</emph> I vould,' and dey offers me a
                  tousand dollars for it, and I takes it, and den I goes and buys dis farm mit de
                  money, and gets me a vife, dat is all I knows."</p>
               <p>"Hem!" exclaimed Mr. Harvey—" very well and clearly told, my friend. Now, if I
                  give you twenty dollars, will you relate this to-morrow in the presence of a
                  witness—whom I shall bring here? Mind, the relation must be made
                     <emph>voluntarily</emph> on your part—say one word of the money, or of any
                  previous visit from me and you are a lost man."</p>
               <p>"I vill take de monies," answered the farmer.</p>
               <p>"Very well, now, can you write?"</p>
               <p>"No, but mine <foreign xml:lang="DUT">vrow</foreign> can."</p>
               <p>"Then let her write a letter which I will dictate."</p>
               <p>"As you please," said the farmer—and he called his wife into the room.</p>
               <p>"Your husband, Mrs. Peyster," said Mr. Harvey, "wishes you to write a letter to a
                  gentleman in New York, which I will put in the post-office for him as I go through
                  the village."</p>
               <p>"I shall be happy to write it, sir," said the female, who was a smart, tidy
                  American woman.</p>
               <p>"Then please to write as I dictate."</p>

                              husband has something to communicate to you, as Mr. Mordant's legal
                              adviser, of the utmost importance to him, and to that gentleman also.
                              On no account, however, mention this to Mr. Mordant until you have
                              called upon my husband or your visit will be useless.</p>

               <p>"I hope, sir, there is nothing in this letter calculated to injure my husband,"
                  said the farmer's wife, when she had finished writing, looking anxiously at Mr.
                  Harvey.</p>
               <p>"Nothing whatever, I assure you; on the contrary, it will result to his benefit.
                  Now," he added, "please to direct the letter to <q>
                     <p>"John Harvey, Esq., Solicitor, &amp;c., &amp;c.,<lb/> No — N—— street,<lb/>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The letter was directed and sealed, and dropped into the post-office at the next
                  village, and Mr. Harvey wished the farmer and his wife "good-day," and returned to
                  New York.</p>
               <p>On the following day he again visited Peyster, taking with him his clerk, and the
                  depositions of the farmer were duly taken down, and the paper signed by both the
                  parties.</p>
               <p>Thus armed, Mr. Harvey returned home, and on the same evening visited Mr. Mordant.
                  That gentleman was seated with his family in the parlor; but upon hearing that Mr.
                  Harvey wished to see him, he directed lights to be placed in his study, and
                  proceeded thither to meet him.</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Mr. Harvey," said he, "pray be seated.<pb n="154-155"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000081"/> To what am I indebted for the pleasure of such a
                  rarity as a visit from you?"</p>
               <p>"To a matter involving rather serious consequences, my dear sir," said Mr. Harvey,
                  taking from his pocket the document containing the depositions of the farmer.</p>
               <p>"Bless me! what's the matter?" exclaimed Mr. Mordant. "Nothing having reference to
                  that scapegrace son of mine, Charles, I hope; that boy, Mr. Harvey, is a source of
                  great uneasiness to me—not that I believe there is anything really evil in his
                  disposition, but he is wild, extravagant, and careless. Young men now-a-days,
                  sir,—the sons of wealthy parents, who know that they will be in future amply
                  provided for—are dreadfully improvident, and are a source of great anxiety to
                  their parents."</p>
               <p>"Set your mind at ease on this subject, Mr. Mordant; this matter does not relate
                  to the young gentleman, but to yourself more particularly. We men of law, Mr.
                  Mordant, are sometimes placed, with regard to our clients and patrons, in rather
                  an awkward position. I was sent for, a day or two since, by a man named Peyster, a
                  Dutch farmer I believe, who having got some strange whim in his head, fancied that
                  his conscience troubled him on account of the disposal of some property he came
                  into in New Jersey several years ago, which was supposed, as far as I can learn,
                  to have belonged to a clergyman named Miller—a relative of yours, Mr. Mordant, but
                  upon which property this Peyster had an old Dutch claim. Here is the letter, you
                  see. Please to read it" (handing the letter he himself had dictated, to Mr.
                  Mordant.)</p>
               <p>The merchant read the letter, and returned it, merely saying—</p>
               <p>"Well, pray proceed, Mr. Harvey. What then?"</p>
               <p>"Thinking that, perhaps, some interests of yours were involved, I visited the man
                  according to his request, and found that he was a rude, ignorant Dutch farmer, but
                  very shrewd and intelligent, Mr. Mordant. I may say, sir, <emph>very
                     shrewd.</emph>"</p>
               <p>And the lawyer refreshed himself with a pinch of snuff, handing the box afterwards
                  to Mr. Mordant.</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you," said the latter, "I never indulge in taking snuff; but what was
                  the nature of the subject upon which he wished to speak with you?"</p>
               <p>"It related to the property in New Jersey, as I have said," replied Mr. Harvey.
                  "Here are the depositions he made. I will read them," and the lawyer read them
                  through steadily and with emphasis. "You see, my dear sir," he continued, when he
                  had concluded the reading, "that this document will place you in a very awkward
                  position—a very disagreeable position, indeed, if the man should choose to be
                  obstinate."</p>
               <p>"But, Mr. Harvey, who will take heed of the ravings of a man like Peyster? he is
                  laboring under some delusion. I have the deed in my possession, and will show it
                  you. It is proof indisputable of the claim—which I purchase in good faith;" and
                  the merchant rose from his seat, and proceeded to extract the deed from an iron
                  safe in the study.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harvey was fully prepared for him; he had not resolved upon his action in this
                  matter without providing himself with every necessary means to go through with it.
                  When Charles Mordant, amongst other things, had abstracted this deed from his
                  father's safe in order fully to satisfy the lawyer of his future ability to
                  reimburse any amount of money he could raise for him, Mr. Harvey had accidently
                  held the yellow parchment up to the light, and discovering, by the merest
                  accident, the private mark and date of the manufacturer of the parchment, found
                  that it had been manufactured in London, upwards of a century after the conquest
                  of New Netherlands by the British, in fact some time after the Declaration of the
                  Independence of the United States of America; and this he knew was sufficient
                  proof of its being a forgery, and that the appearance of age had been affected by
                  artificial means. This discovery it was which had let him into the secret of the
                  fraudulent possession of the property of Mr. Mordant, and had determined him with
                  regard to his future operations.</p>
               <p>He had carefully taken a copy of the deed; making a special note of the date on
                  the parchment, in the margin, and had subsequently given the parchment an
                  appearance of sufficient age, and then, when Charles had visited him a second
                  time, he had directed him to replace the will and deed, and the other documents.
                  It was this copy lie had shown to Mr. Peyster.</p>
               <p>No sooner was the deed shown him, triumphantly, by the merchant, than his quick
                  eye glanced at the mark, which was only observable by a keen scrutiny when the
                  parchment was held in a particular light.</p>
               <p>"Humph!" exclaimed the sharp-witted man of law. "Who was the attorney who effected
                  the transfer of this deed, Mr. Mordant? It was before I was honored with your
                  patronage?"</p>
               <p>"His name was Johnston. He died suddenly about a year<pb n="156-157"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000082"/> afterwards. He was a keen fellow; one not likely to
                  allow himself to be taken in."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Mordant, I meant no, offence sir, indeed, I should be sorry to
                  suppose for a moment, that you were privy to the roguery which is apparent in this
                  affair; but, I should say that this Mr. Johnston <emph>was</emph> a keen fellow.
                  He made a copy of the deed, which, by some means or other, has got into Peyster's
                  hands, and the perusal of which has led to the qualms of conscience, which induced
                  him to send for me. On that copy, in the margin, it is stated that the
                  manufacturer's mark is dated many, many years subsequently to the protested grant
                  of the land. Now, I see that the original deed, which professes to be a grant of a
                  certain quantity of land to Pierre de Peyster—the ancestor, I presume, of the
                  farmer Peyster of whom you purchased the estate—is dated in the year 1654, while
                  the parchment on which it was written, was manufactured in the year 1789. A most
                  conclusive proof Mr. Mordant, of the worthlessness of the deed."</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant turned pale. He, for the moment, forgot himself and said—</p>
               <p>"But this man Peyster is an ignorant fellow. He cannot read. How could he have
                  made the discovery?"</p>
               <p>The astute lawyer took no heed of the implied admission of his knowledge of the
                  forgery on the part of the merchant; but he replied—</p>
               <p>"You forget, my dear sir, that his wife can read: recollect it was she who wrote
                  the letter in her husband's name. Oh! these women are always up to some
                  mischief."</p>
               <p>"I must have been deceived by Johnston; he must have been a consummate scoundrel,"
                  said Mordant; "but, really, this is a most unpleasant business. Excuse me, Harvey,
                  but you must be aware in what an awkward position I should be placed should the
                  affair be bruited abroad. It is a matter of days gone by—"</p>
               <p>"And all the more unpleasant, in consequence of the former proprietor being a
                  relative of yours, I believe," said Mr. Harvey, calmly interrupting the merchant,
                  while he helped himself to another pinch of snuff. "People are so prone to scandal
                  now-a-days, that your enemies, and every man in business—especially every man of
                  wealth like you, my dear sir, has enemies. Your enemies, I say, would seize upon
                  the facts, as a capital pretext to destroy the excellent reputation for integrity
                  that you enjoy."</p>
               <p>"What can be done under the circumstances?" inquired Mr. Mordant, In an agitated
                  manner. "The matter as I have observed, is an affair of days gone by. No one could
                  be injured if it were hushed up."</p>
               <p>"You forget, my dear sir, that the depositions were taken down by me in the
                  presence of a witness."</p>
               <p>"True; but, perhaps, for a consideration that witness might be silenced."</p>
               <p>"But," again interrupted the lawyer, "if I mistake not, Mrs. Miller, the relict of
                  the Reverend Ebenezer Miller, and the rightful owner of the estate, is still
                  living, and has a son still living, and <emph>she</emph>—the widow—is, I believe,
                  in a condition of comparative poverty. She would certainly obtain possession of
                  the property, if she brings forward a suit, and also to all the proceeds, rents,
                  &amp;c., for the last ten years or more. Yes, she would most certainly," he added,
                  in a thoughtful manner. "No doubt of it."</p>
               <p>"What, then, would you, as my legal adviser in this matter, and one in whom I
                  place implicit confidence," said Mr. Mordant, in a conciliating tone of voice,
                  seeing that he was at the lawyer's mercy, "What would you, my dear friend, advise
                  me to do?"</p>
               <p>"Acknowledge at once," said the lawyer, "that you were deceived by the false
                  representations of Mr. Johnston, and restore the property, rents, and
                  accumulations to the widow."</p>
               <p>"Bat are you aware, Mr. Harvey, that the rents of that estate, which, when I
                  purchased it, were worth only $300 per annum, now amount to $1,000, and have
                  realised that sum for the last five years? Why, my dear sir, I should feel the
                  loss severely. All my available capital, you know, as well as I do, is
                  employed."</p>
               <p>"There is one way by which the matter might be settled," replied Mr. Harvey, after
                  having sat for some moments apparently buried in thought. "I am aware how
                  seriously the loss of reputation would injure your credit; and I know also, that
                  when people are used to poverty, they are often really happier under the
                  privations it entails, than they would be if rolling in wealth. I have no doubt
                  Mrs. Miller is contented as she is, and I should be really sorry to see you, one
                  of my wealthiest and most respectable—let me add, most respected clients brought
                  into trouble. For myself, I care nothing. It is my duty to do the best I can for
                  those who employ me to manage their affairs; but this witness whom I took down
                  with me, not<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7191-00000083"/> suspecting for a moment,
                  Mr. Mordant—I would wish you to understand that—that anything of so serious a
                  nature was to be disclosed—this witness, I say, will require to be largely paid to
                  maintain silence. But I think I could manage to seal his tongue; yes, I think I
                     <emph>could</emph> manage it."</p>
               <p>"By what means? Mention how, and you will find me ready to meet your views," said
                  Mr. Mordant, much excited.</p>
               <p>"It would be rather expensive," continued the lawyer; "I could buy him over, and
                  pack him off to Europe or to California, and the probability is he would never be
                  heard of again."</p>
               <p>"And to effect this, how much would you require?"</p>
               <p>"Why, it is difficult to say. Perhaps, for two or three thousand dollars, the
                  thing might be done; yes, I should say that I could manage it for three thousand
                  dollars."</p>
               <p>"Three thousand dollars I" exclaimed the merchant.</p>
               <p>"Three thousand dollars, cash," interrupted the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"It is a very large sum," continued Mr. Mordant, with a sigh; but I suppose, if
                  you say so, I must consent to pay it. Really, this is a most troublesome affair—a
                  very distressing affair."</p>
               <p>"It is, indeed, my dear sir," said the lawyer;" but now, I presume, we may
                  consider it as settled. You will draw me a check for the amount."</p>
               <p>And with a sad heart and an unsteady hand the merchant drew the check and
                  presented it to the lawyer, who rose to take his leave, saying, as he shook the
                  merchant by the hand, on leaving the study—</p>
               <p>"I congratulate you, my dear sir, on the successful arrangement of this little
                  difficulty, for it may now be considered as settled—yes, you may now rest assured
                  that it <emph>will</emph> be settled."</p>
               <p>And he descended the stairs, and a moment afterwards Mr. Mordant heard the slam of
                  the street door, as the servant let the lawyer out.</p>
               <p>"A most consummate hypocrite—a finished scoundrel, that fellow," muttered the
                  merchant, as he listened to the retreating footsteps of the lawyer. "He has
                  actually swindled me out of that money. Three thousand dollars! But I can't help
                  it. He is too conversant with my affairs for me to treat him with the contempt I
                  otherwise would. Well, it's of no use lamenting the loss of the money. I must just
                  put up with it."</p>
               <p>So saying, Mr. Mordant descended to the parlor and joined the family circle, where
                  he endeavored to banish from his mind the recollection of the unpleasant
                  transactions in which he had been engaged.</p>
               <p>"I have Mordant under my thumb now, at all events," muttered Mr. Harvey, as, with
                  the check in his pocket, he plodded his way homewards; and, by Jove! HI keep him
                  there—screw him down like a vice;" and he fairly spit out the words. "However,
                  I've made three thousand dollars by my day's work, and that will do for the
                  present; but I don't mean to destroy the copy of that deed, as I promised I would.
                  Oh, no; I shall take good care of that.</p>
               <p>The lawyer reached the door of his own house and entered it. He retired to rest,
                  and dreamed that night of his gains—and in fancy invested his ill-gotten spoil in
                  various speculations. But were his dreams all happy? Oh, no, no! A guilty
                  conscience weighed like a nightmare upon his breast as he slumbered, and dreams of
                  fortune could not restore peace to the mind from which conscience had long since
                  driven it forth.</p>
               <p>On the following morning, according to appointment, Charles Mordant called
                  upon-Mr. Harvey at his office in N—— street, for the purpose of ascertaining
                  whether the lawyer would advance him the money he required.</p>
               <p>To a certain extent Harvey was satisfied with the aspect matters wore. It was a
                  part of his conceived project to entangle the young man in his toils, and the
                  money was readily advanced, security having been given by Charles upon the
                  property of his father, when it should come into his possession on the old
                  gentleman's death.</p>
               <p>But Charles, amidst all his idle pleasures and gayeties, had his troubles—troubles
                  which drove him deeper and deeper into the dissipations of drink and gambling in
                  order to strive to banish them. He had once or twice since the day on which he had
                  conducted Mrs. Miller to the ferry boat, called upon that lady; having been led to
                  do so in order that he might more closely examine the ring which had attracted his
                  attention when upon her finger. He wished to ascertain if the letter he had caused
                  to be engraved upon the inside of the ring he had given to Jeannette Dixon was on
                  that worn by Mrs. Miller, otherwise so similar; and at length, under pretence of
                  simple curiosity he begged her to let him examine it. The widow took it from her
                  finger and presented it to him. He eagerly glanced at the inside, and there was
                  the letter J plainly engraved.</p>
               <p>"It is that letter," said the widow, observing him notice it, "which satisfies me
                  that it really belonged to my poor unfortunate<pb n="160-161"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000084"/> tunate Jane. I should indeed have recognized it by
                  the peculiar setting; but that makes suspicion certainty, in spite of the
                  anonymous letters I am still receiving, telling me that my poor dear child is
                  still living."</p>
               <p>Charles Mordant became pallid as a corpse as he gazed upon the ring. The widow
                  thought he was touched with pity for her daughter's fate; and her heart softened
                  towards the young man, who, complaining of indisposition, rose to take his
                  leave.</p>
               <p>"God bless you, Charles," said Mrs. Miller, as she shook his hand. "I feel truly
                  grateful to you for the sympathy you feel for my loss. The poor fellow cannot hide
                  it from me," she added, as he left the house. "Poor Charles, I wonder if he was
                  attached to Jane—the thought never struck me before, yet it might have been so.
                  Young men now-a-days are not apt to exhibit such distress at the mere, thought of
                  even such a sad loss as that of mine."</p>
               <p>And Charles, as he returned to the city, thought to himself, "Yes, poor Jeannette
                  has carried out her threats of self destruction. She told me she could not bear to
                  live any longer, if she discovered that I had deceived her by a false marriage.
                  God knows who could have put that fancy into her head; but she must have
                  discovered the truth. Indeed, I thought as much that evening when we were walking
                  together on the Elysian Fields at Hoboken—and then that body found so shortly
                  afterwards, just on the spot, too, and the ring upon the finger. This Captain
                  Seymour might have given a ring that Mrs. Miller thinks resembles this to her
                  daughter; but it is quite improbable that he would have caused the letter: to be
                  engraved inside, and in the same style, too. No, no. God forgive me! I have caused
                  poor Jeannette to commit suicide, and her blood will call to heaven for vengeance
                  upon my head." And the young man, hardened as he was by vice and dissipation,
                  shuddered as he thought of the dreadful fate of his trusting and betrayed
                  victim.</p>

                  <p>A Shark Story—The Mystery of the Recluse of the Island of Annabon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE U. S. ship G—— came to anchor in Clarence Bay, Fernando Po, after having spent
                  several weeks in cruising along the neighboring coast, in the vain endeavor to
                  discover any traces of slavers. The British brig of war Rapid was at anchor in the
                  harbor, as well as two or three merchant ships, the masters of which had come for
                  the purpose of trading for fancy timber, which certainly in its live state should
                  have been sufficiently abundant on the Island, since from one end to the other,
                  and all round to the shores of the sea, it is overgrown with dense, almost
                  impenetrable forest, as are most of the islands upon the African coast in tropical
                  latitudes; although again, as is the case in most of these islands, a lofty, grim,
                  sombre-looking mountain rose in the interior, amidst the crags and precipices of
                  which probably no human foot had ever trodden—since it is generally supposed that
                  the interior of the island, which is of considerable extent, is uninhabited.</p>
               <p>There was little to occupy the men on board the G——, and therefore the crew
                  enjoyed liberty on shore by turns during their stay; and the officers of the G——
                  interchanged visits with those of the Rapid, and accompanied each other in
                  boating, fishing, and shooting excursions. Roads there were none, and but a small
                  settlement on this portion of the coast—another, still smaller settlement, being
                  formed upon the opposite shore; both settlements being peopled with a few dozen
                  whites, consisting of Englishmen and Spaniards—but no women—and the remainder of
                  the inhabitants consisting of coolies and the rude natives of the island, who had
                  been tempted to take up their abode near the European intruders, in the hope of
                  gain. The island was but scantily populated with natives, who bore a ferocious
                  character, having, it is said, once or twice risen and massacred the early Spanish
                  settlers. Be this as it may, at this time they appeared to be the very reverse of
                  ferocious, and were glad to be taken notice of by the sailors, and willingly
                  brought off pine apples and other tropical fruits to the ships, in their rude,
                  fragile canoes—which they exchanged for tobacco and half-worn articles of
                  clothing; and the impression generally prevailed that the ferocity formerly
                  imputed to their charge was occasioned by the cruelties of the Spaniards, who, it
                  was said, hunted them down with bloodhounds, for the purpose of forcing them into
                  slavery—a condition to which the simple natives had a most insuperable
                  objection.</p>
               <p>The natives of Fernando Po are a fine, athletic race of savages—possessing, it is
                  true, both the negro frizzled hair and the negro cast of countenance; but being in
                  general finely modelled, and free and independent in their, carriage. Their<pb
                     n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7191-00000085"/> color is probably black, like their
                  brethern on the coast and in the neighboring islands, but their faces and their
                  bodies, hair and all, from head to foot, are painted with a mixture of yellow palm
                  oil and red ochre, giving then a red salmon color, and a most unique and singular
                  appearance; inasmuch as when they are seen walking on the shore, the rays of the
                  sun shining upon them, they look like so many animated bronze statues. The climate
                  is said to be unhealthy—indeed, most fatal to European constitutions, but at
                  certain seasons of the year, for several weeks together, the malaria, which
                  conduces to this insalubrity, seems to disappear, and at these times, the
                  temperature, though sultry, is delightful and refreshing, in consequence of the
                  cool breezes which blow inland, and temper the heat which would otherwise be
                  insupportable.</p>
               <p>One day young Miller and Lieutenant Ross, accompanied by one of the officers of
                  the Rapid, took a fancy into their heads to start off at an early hour in the
                  morning, and penetrate as far into the forest as possible, in hopes of reaching
                  one of the native villages. Consequently, supplying themselves with a few gaudily
                  colored handkerchiefs, glass beads, common clasp knives, and a store of tobacco in
                  the leaf, to give to the natives they might chance to meet, as propitiatory
                  offerings, and arming themselves with pistols, in case of any difficulty
                  arising—although they took care to conceal their weapons, so as not to alarm the
                  natives they might fall in with—they started shortly after sunrise, and entered
                  the forest of brushwood and canes in the rear of the settlement, and were soon
                  completely enclosed by forest trees of immense size, and by parasite shrubs, and
                  compelled to push on in single file over a trodden path, which seemed to have been
                  traced by the natives by their frequent visits to the settlement. For a long time
                  they pushed on, taking care not to lose the forest path, lest they might miss
                  their way altogether, without meeting with any living thing, save the parrots and
                  other tropical birds which flew above their heads, or the monkeys and squirrels
                  that skipped to and fro from: branch to branch amongst the trees. At length, after
                  having penetrated, as well as they could estimate, for three or four miles into
                  the solitude of the forest, for their progress was necessarily slow, as they had
                  to make their way oftentimes through tangled brushwood and over fields of prickly
                  cactuses, and occasionally diverging from the trodden path to examine more
                  minutely some gigantic specimen of forest growth, or some singular shrub or
                  flower; and they then had to find their way back carefully to the beaten
                  track—they reached a stream, the approach to which was heralded by the grateful
                  sound of falling-water. Soon they came upon a small lake, so small and trim and
                  neat in appearance, that a very little stretch of imagination might have led them
                  to suppose it an artificial lake in the midst of a gentleman's pleasure grounds.
                  The water looked so cool, so pure, so sparkling to the weary travellers, that they
                  resolved to make this their temporary halting place, and to sit down by its banks
                  and lunch upon the biscuits they had brought with them, and to dilute the small
                  bottle of Jamaica that the English officer had thoughtfully provided, with some of
                  the cool water of the lake. However, as they advanced, they saw that a party of
                  natives were sitting on the bank not more than thirty yards in advance of them.
                  They had come upon them unperceived, having until then been concealed by the trees
                  and the undergrowth. A brief council was held, and it was resolved to endeavor to
                  make their acquaintance, more especially as they presented no very formidable
                  appearance, the party consisting of only one man and two women. As they ventured
                  near, the natives seemed at first to be alarmed, and to be thinking of flight; but
                  the officers made signs of amity, and they remained where they were, and allowed
                  them to approach, only taking the precaution of rising to their feet. It was soon
                  seen that the man was bound on a fishing excursion on the coast, and had brought
                  the women with him—his two wives, doubtless—for the purpose of assisting him in
                  his task, and carrying his fishing gear, consisting of a light wicker-work canoe,
                  borne by the women, and containing spears and baskets of baits, and lines of bark
                  with hard wood hooks, and such like rude materials. Since neither the man nor the
                  women could speak a word of English, or even of Spanish, it was impossible to hold
                  conversation with them; but the man courteously endeavored to explain the use of
                  the spears and the other articles in the canoe, while the women stood by and
                  laughed immoderately, as the officers presumed, at the singularity of their
                  appearance, hampered with the clothing, which the simple natives scorned—both the
                  man and the women being entirely naked, without even any attempt at ornament, as
                  common amongst savages as it is amongst civilized beings, unless the frightful
                  scars cut into their flesh, by way of tattoo, which, covering them from the
                  shoulders upwards, could be intended for ornament or for marks of distinction; yet
                  intended for one or the other, undoubtedly they were. A present of tobacco to the
                  man and of some<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7191-00000086"/> glass beads to the
                  women, made friends of them in a moment, and they partook of the biscuits the
                  officers had brought, and furnished them in return with a deliciously cool draught
                  of palm wine, or the inspissated juice of the palm tree, which is produced in
                  great abundance in these islands, and furnishes the favorite beverage of the
                  natives.</p>
               <p>After a little time the parties separated, the officers having resolved to reach a
                  village which they understood by signs from the man was only a short distance
                  before them, and the natives going their way towards the coast, the man walking
                  first, a free and independent lord of the creation, and the women tottering along
                  behind him, laden with the canoe and the fishing implements.</p>
               <p>Soon the sound of voices, shouting from the tops of the tall, straight palm trees,
                  notified the party of their, approach towards the village, and as they approached
                  nearer, numerous bronze-like figures were seen far above the heads of the
                  officers, supported at the very tops of the trees by strong hoops of bark which
                  passed around their bodies and the trees likewise, their knees pressing against
                  the bark, and their backs against the hoop, thus holding themselves securely
                  aloft, having reached their position by gradually wriggling the hoop in an upward
                  direction; a wide clearing was now before the party, in which some hundreds of the
                  natives were basking in the sun. A shout announced their approach, and the women
                  fled to the covert of the forest trees surrounding the clearing, and the officers
                  found themselves in the midst of the male inhabitants of the village. Their sudden
                  appearance seemed to create no alarm; the natives thronged around them
                  good-humoredly, and offered them palm wine to drink, and various fruits to refresh
                  themselves with; but, although disposed to friendship and communicative-ness,
                  unfortunately none of them could speak a word of any language intelligible to
                  their visitors. At last an old man was led forward supporting himself by a crutch,
                  who, from the reverence with which he was treated by the assemblage, was evidently
                  either a chief of note or a sorcerer. He was colored with the customary red ochre,
                  and frightfully gashed by the horrible tattoo process; nevertheless there was an
                  appearance of mildness in his features, and his great age, for he was a very old
                  man, inspired confidence and respect. He was led to Lieutenant Ross.</p>
               <p>"How do," "Thank you," "Good-bye," "God dam," "<foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >Tambien,</foreign>" "very well," "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Sacre
                     Tonnere,</foreign>" "<foreign xml:lang="SPA">muchas gracias,</foreign>" poured
                  forth from his lips with wonderful rapidity, testified to his abilities as a
                  linguist, and notwithstanding the strange mixture of phrases, and the equivocal
                  character of some of them, testified also, as the officers supposed, to his
                  amiable desire to extend to them a cordial welcome.</p>
               <p>"How do—Very well, thank you," replied the lieutenant, grasping the extended hand
                  of the aged chief. "<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Care tobacco V? mucha's
                     buono</foreign>—oh, very good I" at the same time tendering him a "hand" of
                  leaf tobacco, which he received with every evidence of extreme satisfaction; but
                  unfortunately this was the extent of the conversation that could be carried
                  on—since the vocabulary of the chief extended no further than to the expression of
                  the sentences he had already rehearsed. However, plenty of palm wine was drank,
                  and limes, and guavas, and cocoa nuts presented, as tokens of hospitality, and
                  after resting some time, the party bethought themselves of returning to their
                  vessel. They made signs to be introduced to the women, who, timid as they were,
                  were instinct with the natural curiosity of the daughters of Eve—and could be
                  discovered peeping cautiously out from behind the trees, but this introduction
                  could not be effected, and the salmon-colored beauties remained ensconced in their
                  hiding place.</p>
               <p>One singularity they noted, viz., that there appeared to be no huts—the sleeping
                  places of the villagers seeming to be the wicker work canoes, in which they
                  pursued their avocation of fishing, which were here and there slung like hammocks
                  between the trees.</p>
               <p>As they were about to leave, a youth came forward with a large basket of limes and
                  plantains, and various peppers for pickling, which he offered for sale to young
                  Miller. It was impossible to carry them to the ship then, but the young midshipman
                  made signs to the lad that if he would bring them to the ship himself on the
                  morrow, he would give him half a dollar, and a lot of tobacco for them. With this
                  bargain the lad appeared satisfied, and the officers went their way, arriving on
                  board the ship in the evening—rather fatigued, yet still pleased with their day's
                  adventure.</p>
               <p>On the following morning, probably encouraged by the visit of the preceding day,
                  not only was the lad already mentioned alongside of the ship in his canoe with the
                  limes and plantains, but a score of canoes filled with natives accompanied him,
                  all anxious to dispose of similar stores—and they found a ready market.</p>
               <p>Captain P—— was anxious to take some more ballast on<pb n="166-167"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000087"/> board, as the consumption of provisions and water
                  had considerably lightened the ship, and some stones that lay on a reef at a
                  distance offered the best ballast he could procure. He thought this a good
                  opportunity to obtain it without exposing his crew to the arduous and dangerous
                  task of getting it on board, exposed to the rays of the sun while immersed to the
                  waist in water. A bargain was struck with the natives, who eagerly accepted it, to
                  fill their canoes with ballast from the reef and bring it to the ship they leaving
                  their vegetables and fruits on board, to receive payment for them when the job was
                  completed.</p>
               <p>Away they went to work, and in a short time several canoe loads were brought on
                  board. Several accidents, such as the upsetting of canoes that were loaded, had
                  occurred, but they seemed only to be a source of merriment to the negroes, who
                  immediately righted their fragile craft, and getting on board again, proceeded to
                  refill them while, the crew enjoyed the scene from the decks of the G——.</p>
               <p>At length a more than usual commotion seemed to take place, in consequence of the
                  upsetting of a canoe, and the voices of the negroes were beard, in wail and
                  lamentation, borne across the water. The canoes were, perhaps, half a mile distant
                  from the ship, and nothing could be seen with the naked eye as to the cause of the
                  unusual disturbance Spy glasses were, however, put in requisition, and the fins of
                  several sharks were seen above the water, which had been attracted to the spot,
                  probably, by the scent of the naked bodies of the negroes, as they swam around the
                  canoes.</p>
               <p>"I fear some accident has happened," said a lieutenant to Captain P——; "the
                  negroes seem to be in a great fluster about something."</p>
               <p>"Oh, it's nothing of any consequence, depend upon it," was the reply of the
                  captain. "Those fellows are like fish in the water; they are merely amusing
                  themselves; but I wish they would hasten aboard and let us complete our
                  ballast."</p>
               <p>"By heaven! there are sharks all around them!" exclaimed the lieutenant again;
                  "see, doctor," handing his glass to the ship's surgeon.</p>
               <p>"Sharks, pooh! nonsense," replied the doctor; "there are only ground sharks
                  hereabouts, and they seldom or never attack human beings in the water." However,
                  he took the glass and peered through it, and then added, "Upon my word, I am
                  afraid something <emph>is</emph> the matter."</p>
               <p>"I have heard," said the captain, "that these ground sharks, though, in general,
                  lazy, lubberly brutes, are more savage than any other species, when awakened from
                  their semi-torpor. They must have been aroused by the noise and clamor of the
                  negroes, and very likely some of the poor devils have fallen victims to their
                  ferocity. Mr. Ross, let a boat be lowered, sir, and take half a dozen hands, and
                  go and see what is the matter."</p>
               <p>The boat was lowered with the promptitude always observable on board a man-of-war,
                  and the lieutenant and crew put off to the scene of distress—for that there really
                  was distress, was now plainly apparent; for, ringing clamorously over the water,
                  loader and louder, was heard the wail of the negroes, and the cry seemed to be
                  heard on shore, and understood and responded to, for groups of negroes gathered on
                  the hill-sides, and joined their wail to that of their comrades.</p>
               <p>Soon a large double banked canoe was seen to quit the beach, propelled by upwards
                  of twenty paddles, seeming to fly over the water with the swiftness of a bird,
                  rather than to cut its way through it; rapidly it flew past the man-of-war's boat,
                  and in an inconceivably short space of time was at the scene of disaster; and ere
                  the lieutenant reached the spot, the canoe was on its return, followed by all the
                  rest—the wail of distress rising louder and louder as they neared the ship. Soon
                  they were alongside—the larger canoe coming alongside under the ship's counter,
                  beneath the quarter-deck, on which the officers were grouped under the awning.</p>
               <p>A piece of torn sail was extended over the stern-sheets of the canoe, which was
                  raised when it came alongside; and as the negroes in the larger canoe raised it,
                  the wail and lamentation burst forth louder than ever, and was again responded to
                  from the shore.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my God!" exclaimed the surgeon, who happened at that moment to be looking
                  over the side; and he placed his hands before his face and shuddered.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Doctor?" inquired young Miller, who was standing near
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Look and see for yourself," replied the surgeon, taking the youth by the arm and
                  leading him to the bulwarks. "It is horrible—horrible!"</p>
               <p>The young midshipman went to the side and looked over. It was a horrible sight,
                  indeed, that met his gaze and that of a hundred others, who by this time
                  understood that the larger<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7191-00000088"/> canoe was
                  the object of attention, and who, perhaps, partially guessed the cause, for
                  extended in the bottom of the canoe, were the lifeless remains of the youth who
                  had sold young Miller the basket of limes in the morning. One of the legs had been
                  severed at the hip, as if chopped off with a hatchet. One of the arms had been
                  taken off, in like manner, a short distance above the elbow, and the entrails had
                  been torn out entirely, so that the interior of the body lay exposed like that of
                  a sheep at the butcher's shambles. The remaining portions of the flesh were torn
                  with the sharp teeth of the sharks, the head alone was untouched, and thus from
                  the features still in death, was the body recognized. Soon the larger canoe,
                  followed by the rest, went on shore, and loud throughout the night rose the wail
                  of the native watchers, and in the morning the body was buried, attended by
                  thousands of natives and numerous officers who were actuated by curiosity and a
                  wish to testify their sympathy in the sorrowful demonstrations of the negroes. All
                  the bits of crape and black cloth that were available were begged by the natives,
                  and worn around their arms in imitation of the officers, whom at different periods
                  they had seen following the body of some messmate, who had fallen a victim to the
                  diseases of the climate; and for two or three days the funeral ceremonies were
                  continued—watch fires being kept burning during the night—and the lamentations of
                  the women resounding across the water, and echoed by the hills. Simple as was the
                  funeral—rude as were the notions of the poor, ignorant creatures, it was a solemn
                  scene, and calculated to make an impression on the most careless beholder. At all
                  events it was sufficient proof, that, savage as might be the nature of the
                  untutored negroes, they were earnest and unfailing in their respect for the memory
                  of the dead.</p>
               <p>After this shocking catastrophe there was no more loading of ballast, and in the
                  course of a few days the G—— prepared for sea; the Rapid still remained behind;
                  but the captain came on board the G—— to see his friends off.</p>
               <p>"I wonder," said Captain P——, while standing by the side of the English captain,
                  watching the receding shore as the vessel sailed out of the bay, "I wonder if it
                  would be of any use taking another cruise along the coast just now; perhaps I
                  might meet with better luck than I met with before?"</p>
               <p>"I rather think not," replied the English captain. "The Rapid, in company with the
                  Firefly, has been cruising up and down from Loango to Cape Coast Castle, for some
                  months, in search of two noted slavers—one the Albatross. I don't know her
                  captain's name, but report says he is a terrible fellow; the other, the Dolphin,
                  commanded by a renegade Frenchman named Junot, one of the most unmitigated
                  scoundrels that ever breathed, and I much fear—indeed, I feel certain that both
                  have escaped. We captured the Dolphin off the coast, crammed full of slaves—that
                  is to say, the fellow entreated us to cease firing, lowered his flag, and allowed
                  me to send a master's mate on board as prize master. The captain was, of course,
                  put in irons, but my brig was short-handed—I have lost so many of my best men
                  since I have been on this infernal coast—and the crew were wanted to work the
                  prize. We thought there was no danger, especially as there were two of us, of her
                  escape—but the Firefly set sail in chase of the other fellow, and suddenly two or
                  three guns were fired right into my rigging, disabling me so much, and so wholly
                  unexpected was the fire, too, that I was unable for the moment to reply to it, and
                  the confounded brig shot ahead and was clear off in no time. I fired after her,
                  for pursuit in my crippled condition was useless; but the shot fell short. So, as
                  I have said, I lost one of the best prizes I ever captured. I would have given six
                  months pay to have got hold of that devil incarnate, Junot."</p>
               <p>"It was too bad," said Captain P——, "yet the fellow must be a clever
                  scoundrel."</p>
               <p>"Clever; bat an arrant coward, so report says."</p>
               <p>"And you never saw her again?"</p>
               <p>"Saw her again! Faith, no. She is lying at anchor in Cuba, by this time, I
                  presume. The worst part of the affair was, she went off with my master's mate and
                  six of my best seamen on board; poor fellows—I wonder what their fate has
                  been?"</p>
               <p>"I should hardly think the fellow would dare to harm <emph>them,</emph>" answered
                  Captain P——, "most likely he would treat them well, and put them on shore
                  somewhere."</p>
               <p>"I hope so! but I have my misgivings," replied the Englishman.</p>
               <p>"And the Firefly; did she succeed in the chase?"</p>
               <p>"No, she came back about three days afterwards—the Albatross that she was in chase
                  of, sails like a witch; and besides, they 'hove to' to pick up a poor negress whom
                  I suppose the captain tossed overboard, on purpose to try if the humanity of the
                  captain of the Firefly was greater than his sire to secure a prize."</p>
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7191-00000089"/>
               <p>"And where is the Firefly now?"</p>
               <p>"She is gone to Sierra Leone to repair, and I suppose the rescued negress will be
                  sent to Liberia."</p>
               <p>"Then you think it would be useless cruising just now along the coast. I must say
                  it is tedious work—unless something is to be gained by it."</p>
               <p>"I should say it was. Let the fellows have a few months respite, and then pounce
                  down upon them unawares. I think that would be the best plan; for my part, I have
                  set my heart on capturing this devil Junot; and, although, I am entitled to return
                  home, I exchanged with the officer that came to take my place, with the express
                  intention of remaining a few months longer, in the hope of success."</p>
               <p>"In that ease," said Captain P——, "I shall follow up my intention of visiting the
                  islands. I shall go to St. Thomas and thence to Annabon."</p>
               <p>"Oh, by the bye, speaking of Annabon," said the English captain, "that puts me in
                  mind of a little bit of romance connected with that island. My dear fellow, you
                  can't do better than pay a visit to the White Lady of Annabon."</p>
               <p>"The White Lady of Annabon!" exclaimed Captain P——. Who the d—l is she—a ghost or
                  a fairy?"</p>
               <p>"Neither the one nor the other, though beautiful and almost ethereal enough to be
                  the latter."'</p>
               <p>"Who is she, then?"</p>
               <p>"That nobody knows. She was only discovered by the captain of one of our cruisers
                  a few weeks since, and I have not seen her yet. I describe her from his
                  description. When I say discovered, I mean that until of late it was unknown that
                  such a being was upon the island, although it appears, from Captain Hall's
                  account, that she must have been residing there for years, and she has quite a
                  splendid establishment."</p>
               <p>"Have you no idea, then, who she is?"</p>
               <p>"Not the least in the world; although some of these days I mean to pay her a
                  visit, and to endeavor to find her out. I can only surmise that she is the wife,
                  or mistress, or daughter of some pirate or slave dealer, who has managed to keep
                  his treasure there in seclusion for years. It may be so it may be not. At any
                  rate, it is quite in the style of the corsair and Medora, or Juan and Haidee,
                  isn't it? It's enough to pique a fellow's curiosity."</p>
               <p>"It has raised mine to the highest pitch, I can assure you," said Captain P——,
                  "and I shall certainly follow your advice, and pay the lady a visit—but it isn't
                  all a hoax of Captain Hall's, as you call him?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no; I know Hall too well to fear that. That there is some enchanting
                  embodiment of female loveliness on the island of Annabon, I have no doubt. How she
                  got there, or who she is, are different matters."</p>
               <p>The G—— by this time had stretched far from the land, and shaking Captain P—— by
                  the hand, and bidding farewell to the officers, the captain of the Rapid returned
                  to the harbor, while the G—— held on her course towards St. Thomas. In the course
                  of a week she reached that island, but did not long remain there, as the captain,
                  excited by what he had heard from Captain Trainer, of the English brig, was
                  anxious to reach Annabon.</p>
               <p>He still had the young woman Charlotte Herbert on board, whom, the reader will
                  recollect, he had picked up at sea, after the burning of the Laurel. It had been
                  his intention to carry her to Sierra Leone, as the most desirable place to set her
                  on shore. Now a new idea came into his head. If it really turned out that a young
                  white female was residing on Annabon, he would leave the young girl temporarily
                  with her, for he was well aware a ship of war was no place for her to remain on
                  board of.</p>
               <p>In due time the G—— reached Annabon, and, to the captain's surprise—although he
                  now began to believe the story a hoax—no such person was known in the settlement,
                  off which ships usually anchored; but, by dint of earnest inquiry, he learnt from
                  some negroes that it was said there was such a being resident on the southern
                  coast, in a secluded bay.</p>
               <p>Rendered more curious than ever, the captain resolved to cruise round the island
                  as close to the shore as possible, and one morning his curiosity was gratified by
                  the sight of a cottage different entirely from those usual on the coast, and quite
                  concealed amongst the trees.</p>
               <p>The ship was brought to anchor in the offing—the bay was only navigable for small
                  boats: and Captain P—— resolved to send Charlotte Herbert on shore, with one of
                  his officers, as an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">avant courrier.</foreign> "Here, Mr.
                  Miller," he said, after the sails had been furled and the boat lowered, and he had
                  given notice to Charlotte Herbert of his intentions, "you are a smart looking
                  fellow, and, I should judge, ought to make a good squire of dames. Don your best
                  uniform, sir, and accompany Miss Herbert ashore to this fairy lady's abode, and
                  see that you bring<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7191-00000090"/> back a good account
                  of yourself. Give the lady my compliments, and say that Captain P——, of the U. S.
                  ship G——, will shortly do himself the honor of waiting upon her ladyship."</p>
               <p>The youth would not have desired any pleasanter errand. He was ready and on board
                  the boat in a few minutes. The boat put off from the ship's side, and five
                  minutes' pull carried her into the creek, which was the only visible landing
                  place. The captain watched them from the ship with his spyglass, and saw the young
                  midshipman and Miss Herbert enter the glade, where the foliage of trees and shrubs
                  concealed them from his view.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A Surprise and somewhat of a Mystery arising out of the Visit to the White Lady
                     of Annabon, and still more Mystery arising out of the Interview.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOR years it had remained unsuspected that the lonely island of Annabon contained
                  so lovely a specimen of budding womanhood as the fair Greek bridge of the slaver
                  captain, and but for the indiscretion of the young girl, or rather but for the
                  anxious hope that had led her without reflection to signalize a British cruiser,
                  thinking it was the Albatross, as many more years might have passed away without
                  Captain Seymour's secret having been discovered. One morning, about a month before
                  the G—— had entered Clarence Bay, Fernando Po, the British crusier Alacrity,
                  Captain Hall, sighted the Island of Annabon, while pursuing her course from
                  Ascension to the mouth of the river Gaboon in Biaffra. Curiosity probably tempted
                  the captain to hug the land closely, and as he, in company with the lieutenant of
                  the watch, was gazing upon the shore through his spy-glass, and expatiating upon
                  the beauties of the scenery as creek after creek opened to their view as they
                  rounded the various points, disclosing a panorama of the most enchanting and
                  inviting landscape scenery, the attention of both gentlemen was attracted by the
                  appearance of what seemed to be a white flag flying from a pole on the summit of a
                  hillock whence was a clear vista between the forest trees, from the hill to the
                  sea, forming either an artificial glade of wondrous beauty, or else being one of
                  those natural clearances often found in these generally thickly wooded islands, to
                  imitate which, would put to the test the skill of the most artistic landscape
                  gardener.</p>
               <p>"Bless me I" said the captain, lowering his glass for a moment, and turning to the
                  officer, "that is surely a white flag flying from the summit of yonder eminence;
                  there, between those forest trees in the opening," pointing with his finger in the
                  direction. "Do you see it?"</p>
               <p>"I have observed it for some minutes; I thought I saw it hoisted as soon as we
                  rounded the point there," replied the lieutenant; "but as I could not conceive
                  what it could, be at first, I did not speak—I wished to be certain that it was
                  really a flag. It is evidently some signal flying. What can it mean?"</p>
               <p>"I'm sure I can't say; a white flag; let me see; a single white flag answers to
                  none of our signals, except it be meant for a flag of truce, and that it can't
                  be," replied the captain, smiling at the conceit. "It must have been hoisted
                  purposely to arrest our attention, though, for, as you say, it was not flying when
                  we opened upon the glade. It surely can't be any party from our cruisers who have
                  by some means been left ashore here? However, we'll reply to it, Mr. Thompson.
                  Harley, (calling to a midshipman,) tell the signal man to give you the white flag,
                  and run it up; and brace forward the yards a little, Mr. Thompson, (again
                  addressing the lieutenant) we'll stand in a little closer; the water is deep here
                  close in to the land; and send a boat ashore. Get the gig ready, and put six hands
                  on board her, and you had better go; no, stay, I'll go myself, and solve the
                  mystery."</p>
               <p>The vessel was soon as close in shore as it was thought safe to run her, when the
                  captain ordered the main yard to be "laid aback," and descended into the gig,
                  which had already been lowered, and hauled up alongside. In a few minutes she had
                  entered the creek, which formed the landing place, and the captain sprung
                  ashore.</p>
               <p>Zuleika, as soon as she had seen the answer to her signal flying from the gaff-end
                  of the cruiser, had quitted the hillock without waiting to scrutinize more closely
                  the appearance of the vessel. Had she done so, after it had drawn nearer the land,
                  she would have perhaps known that it was not the Albatross, and a little
                  reflection might have told her that unless some accident had occurred to tender it
                  necessary for her husband's vessel to return, it could not have been the Albatross
                  that had so soon made her reappearance; but, poor child, she was not used to draw
                  deductions from reflection, and if she had<pb n="174-175"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000091"/> been, she would probably, in her simplicity, guided
                  by the sentiments of her own impulsive nature, have thought it nothing to be
                  wondered at, if Captain Seymour had returned to bid her again farewell, before he
                  left her for so long a time.</p>
               <p>Jane Miller had, however, remained behind for some minutes after Zuleika had
                  descended the hill, and when the vessel's main yard had been thrown "aback," she
                  saw, now the ship was close in shore, that there was some mistake. She hurried
                  after Zuleika, who was running in such breathless haste towards the lauding place,
                  that she had nearly arrived in sight of the creek before Jane overtook her.</p>
               <p>"There is some mistake that vessel is not the Albatross," she said; and at this
                  moment, the boat having grounded, Captain Hall was seen approaching—" and that is
                  not Captain Seymour," she added, directing Zuleika's attention to the
                  stranger.</p>
               <p>The poor girl suddenly stopped, trembling with disappointment and apprehension.
                  The thought struck her that something dreadful must have happened to her husband;
                  perhaps his vessel had been lost and he was drowned, and the stranger captain was
                  coming to tell her—for had he not answered her signal? Jane, who was more
                  conversant with sea usages, endeavored to reassure her, while she placed her arm
                  around the almost fainting girl's waist.</p>
               <p>"The signal has been answered, as all such signals would be, even by strangers,"
                  said she. "I have been told that there are several men-of-war on this coast. That
                  vessel looks like one to me. I once saw one in New York. The captain has
                  understood the signal as a request to send a boat ashore. He is coming to know
                  what's wanted."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Santa Maria!</foreign>" exclaimed Zuleika, her alarm now
                  taking another shape; "what shall we do?"</p>
               <p>"Simply answer the questions he may put, and inform him the flag was hoisted by
                  mistake."</p>
               <p>"And say that I took his vessel to be that of my husband," interrupted
                  Zuleika.</p>
               <p>"Nay," said Jane Miller, who, with more knowledge of the world than her companion,
                  feared that such an explanation would, perhaps, involve Seymour in difficulty at
                  some future day. "It is very likely the captain does not speak Spanish, or at
                  least, only indifferently, as I do. Say that the flag was hoisted by a mistake,
                  and leave him to infer the rest; and Zuleika, be careful; do not betray my
                  disguise."</p>
               <p>While this conversation had been going forward, Captain Hall had nearly reached
                  the spot where they stood. He had discovered them almost as soon as they had
                  perceived him.</p>
               <p>"A petticoat, by all that's wonderful!" was his rough, sailor-like exclamation.
                  "What can be the meaning of it? I've had the good fortune to fall in with a
                  romantic adventure, at all events. Quite a God-send to relieve the dull monotony
                  of cruising on this infernal coast."</p>
               <p>"Observing that the female, whoever she might be, was awaiting his arrival,
                  attended by a young man attired in European costume, he slackened his pace, and
                  walked leisurely towards them—and, as he had subsequently told Captain Trainer,
                  lie was perfectly astonished at the loveliness of the island damsel.</p>
               <p>As Jane Miller had anticipated, he scarcely spoke or understood a word of Spanish;
                  and having courteously addressed Zuleika in English, to which she, adopting Jane's
                  advice, replied in Spanish, although she was at this time sufficiently acquainted
                  with English to understand him. He turned to Jane, and addressed her in a similar
                  manner. Jane replied also in Spanish—sufficiently good to deceive the captain—but
                  observing the alarm of Zuleika, she endeavored to signify that a mistake had been
                  made in hoisting the flag, and to beg their unexpected visitor to accompany them
                  to the cottage and take some refreshment.</p>
               <p>The captain was able to understand this, and nothing loth to obey, he accompanied
                  them to their residence, which he found to be handsomely furnished, and supplied
                  with not only the necessaries but the luxuries of life; and situated in the midst
                  of a well cultivated garden, while the books and pictures, and instruments of
                  music scattered about the apartment, showed the intellectual taste of the fair
                  occupant.</p>
               <p>The captain was perfectly bewildered, and almost fancied himself the victim of
                  some fairy delusion. He, however, partook of the <emph>material</emph>
                  refreshments offered him, and, after resting for some time, courteously bade
                  farewell to his lovely hostess, and as much bewidered as ever—quite unable to
                  conceive who the beautiful being could be who resided thus in a condition of
                  almost perfect seclusion in this lonely isle—he returned to the boat and ordered
                  the men to pull him on board his vessel. He could only account for what he had
                  witnessed in the manner that he had done to Captain Trainer—viz., by supposing
                  that the lady of the isle was the wife, or more likely the daughter<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000092"/> of some pirate or slaver captain. Thus was effected
                  the discovery of the white lady of Annabon.</p>
               <p>The calm, sweet seclusion of Annabon once invaded, its future privacy was doomed.
                  The flower that bloomed upon its soil was top fair to remain hidden from the
                  world's admiration when once its beauties had been noised abroad. Annabon, lovely
                  and lonely island as it was, could no longer afford shelter and security to the
                  dove that whispered peace, and hope, and love to the heart of the wayward Seymour;
                  to her who alone was able to hush the strife of the discordant elements that raged
                  within his breast; to speak peace, and hope, and love, and awaken happiness in the
                  breast of him from whose bosom, but for her softening influence, the hope of
                  happiness would have been forever banished. But of this intrusion into the
                  sanctuary of his love he knew not yet. What was the result of it when he did know
                  it? Time will show.</p>
               <p>Both Zuleika and Jane Miller had seen the G—— as she approached the island, and
                  had observed the boat put off from her side and pull towards the creek; but,
                  warned by the result of former inadvertency, they had made no sign—hoisted no
                  signal of recognition. They awaited at the cottage the result of the visit, which
                  they believed was intended for them, and which they also believed had been caused
                  by the visit of the stranger captain a few weeks before.</p>
               <p>young Miller and Charlotte Herbert found no one, therefore, to meet them when they
                  stepped ashore from the boat; but they perceived the pathway that had been trodden
                  through the woods, hereabouts thinned of trees, but almost impenetrable, save by
                  the pathway, in consequence of the prickly cactuses—the weeds of this country—the
                  cherished exotics of northern climes—which spread themselves in every direction.
                  Following the path, they at length arrived in sight of the little clearing, the
                  plantation, and the cottage. Some negroes approached them, and asked what the
                  strangers wanted; but they could not understand them; they pointed to the cottage
                  and pursued their way. The influence of civilization—perhaps, still more, the
                  influence of the gentle being who had caused the refinement of civilization to
                  find an abiding place amidst these savage solitudes—had rendered the very negroes
                  courteous and kindly. Interpreting the signs made to them, they guided the
                  travellers on their way by the nearest and smoothest paths.</p>
               <p>Observing them approach the cottage, and seeing that one of the strange visitors
                  was female—a strange visitor, indeed, to the solitudes of Annabon—Zuleika and Jane
                  Miller came forth from the cottage to meet them; but the latter, to her mingled
                  surprise, joy, and consternation, recognized in the young officer her brother. Her
                  first impulse was to rush into his arms—her next, to fly, and hide herself from
                  his gaze; but then she thought, "Since I have been able to deceive Captain
                  Seymour, and even Zuleika, as regards my sex, it is hardly likely <emph>he</emph>
                  will recognize me. My attire, my close-cropped hair, my bronzed complexion, will
                  deceive him likewise." She hoped they would, and yet, strange contrariety, she
                  felt her heart swell and throb almost to bursting at the thought that her
                  brother—her only brother—should meet her, here, so far distant from those she
                  loved at home, an outcast from her friends by her own actions, a victim of her own
                  mad infatuation-and pass her by unheeded. She could not endure the thought, and
                  she turned aside her head to conceal the tears that, in spite of herself, gushed
                  to her eyes. What would she not have given to have met here, in this distant
                  solitude, her brother, alone; no one near to witness the interview—to become
                  cognizant of her shame. He was younger than she, but still, as her brother,
                  especially now that he was growing towards man's estate, she could have looked up
                  to him as a protector.</p>
               <p>"Oh, had I but met him alone," she murmured, "I would have confided all to
                  him."</p>
               <p>But she had little need to turn her head away, and hide her gushing tears. The
                  young man had hardly noticed her. He had seen one whom he believed to be a youth
                  of his own age accompany the lady he had been sent to visit, and then his whole
                  attention had been absorbed in the contemplation of the lady's surpassing
                  loveliness. Thomas Miller was just of that age when the imagination of youth first
                  commences to become susceptible to the influence of female beauty, and he thought
                  that he saw before him the embodiment of all that a poet's or a lover's
                  imagination (much the same thing in this regard) could conceive to be the
                  perfection of feminine loveliness—the cold, passionless ideal of the statuary's
                  art, wrought to perfection from the separate beauties of a dozen models, instinct
                  with life and feeling, and glowing in all her living, breathing, blushing,
                  peerless charms; and Jane observed this admiration, and a cold chill struck to her
                  heart. It was foolish—she knew her brother had not recognized her—she felt that,
                  as she was now, in the presence of those by whom she was surrounded, she would
                  sooner part from him forever—would sooner die, solitary<pb n="178-179"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000093"/> outcast as she felt herself to be, than that he
                     <emph>should</emph> recognize her; and yet she felt, bitterly felt, this
                  all-absorbing admiration of a stranger, while she, his lost sister, was so near;
                  and no look, not one searching gaze, not one perplexing doubt upon his features,
                  as he turned towards her, that might lead her to suppose he thought that in the
                  supposed youth before him he recognized his sister's lineaments. Was she then
                  utterly forgotten—cast adrift forever from the affections of those she had
                  abandoned at the dictates of an infatuation that now she shuddered and wondered
                  at? Yet it was as she had but that moment wished it would be—her disguise was
                  complete, her brother knew her not; and still, strange contrariety of human
                  nature, we, repeat, she felt as though the agony of soul she suffered were
                  unendurable, as thus she stood—her loss forgotten, her very existence seemingly
                  ignored by him whom, from the days of his earliest childhood, she had nursed, and
                  fondled, and loved with all the devotion of an only sister's love.</p>
               <p>The young midshipman knew only a very few phrases of Spanish, which he had picked
                  up at school, and he was using these very much at random, in the endeavor to make
                  himself agreeable to the unknown lady. He appeared quite to have forgotten that he
                  had the duty to perform of introducing Charlotte Herbert; and the young woman,
                  observing the absorption of her escort, smiled to herself, and advanced to the
                  spot where Jane Miller was standing. Perhaps the youth and good looks of the
                  supposed boy interested her; she addressed to Jane a few words in Spanish, with
                  which language she had, during her residence in New Orleans, become slightly
                  acquainted, and extended her hand. Jane took the proffered hand, and smiled
                  faintly, at the same time replying in Spanish; but suddenly she snatched her hand
                  away, as though it had been stung by a scorpion—a convulsive shudder passed
                  through her frame, and her heart seemed to rise in her throat and choke her
                  utterance. Her palm had come in contact with the ring Miss Herbert wore that day
                  on the third finger of the right hand, and she had glanced towards it. It was the
                  counterpart of the ring she had been presented with by Seymour. "Oh God!" she
                  thought, "is this another victim to <emph>his</emph> wiles—am I not alone in my
                  wretchedness?" and then she looked towards the spot where the young midshipman and
                  Zuleika were still engaged in broken attempts at conversation. "Alas!" she
                  murmured, "poor, poor deceived Zuleika!"</p>
               <p>Charlotte Herbert knew not what to think of the strange action of the supposed
                  boy. She and with a look of commiseration she imagined he again addressed him; but
                  Jane had turned her back, and walking towards an arbor, near by, she took from her
                  bosom a ring tied to a piece of black silk ribbon. "I could not have lost it," she
                  muttered; "no: and if I had, how could she have found it? it is too true; it must
                  be as I surmise. Here is my ring; I seldom look at it now. Henceforward it is
                  valueless, indeed. Seymour must have given a similar ring to that young woman; but
                  this is folly on my part; poor thing, she too, as well as I, is to be pitied.
                  Strange, too, that <emph>she</emph> should have come <emph>hither,</emph>" and
                  recovering in some degree her composure, she returned to Miss Herbert, made some
                  trifling excuse of sudden indisposition, and her resolution not to be recognized
                  by her brother, returning with renewed strength, she walked slowly towards the
                  cottage, leaving Zuleika and her visitors together.</p>
               <p>The young midshipman endeavored to make it understood that his captain would
                  shortly pay the lady of the isle a visit, and then, leaving Miss Herbert on shore
                  with Zuleika; he went back to the boat and returned on board the vessel.</p>
               <p>"Come on board, sir," said the youngster, as after ascending the side of the G——,
                  he advanced to the captain, touching his cap with his forefinger.</p>
               <p>"So I perceive Mr. Miller," said the captain, "well, sir, and what report have you
                  to make? Where is Miss Herbert?"</p>
               <p>"I left her behind, as you desired me to do, sir, if I was fortunate enough to
                  meet with the young lady."</p>
               <p>"From which I infer that you have been fortunate enough to do so. Did you deliver
                  my message?"</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, sir, I scarcely know whether I did or not. I tried to do so, at any
                  rate."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean by that, sirrah?" said the captain, sharply. "You
                     <emph>tried</emph> to deliver my message?"</p>
               <p>"As well as I could in Spanish, sir, but I guess my language was something like
                  that of Mr. Ross, when he held the palaver with the old chief at Fernando Po, a
                  sort of mixture of English, bad French, and worse Spanish."</p>
               <p>The lieutenant, who was standing near by, turned to the lad, and playfully shook
                  his fist at him. "None of your impertinent allusions to my Spanish," said he, "if
                  you please, Mr. Miller."</p>
               <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7191-00000094"/>
               <p>"Well, well," continued the captain, "I suppose you made yourself understood?"</p>
               <p>"I imagine I did, sir."</p>
               <p>"And what sort of a creature is this divinity of the island—this White Lady of
                  Annabon, as Trainer quaintly called her, Some hideous old hag, I suppose, whom the
                  vivid fancy of Captain Hall has persuaded himself is an angel of light. I have
                  known such Quixotic transformations of Dulcineas into Duchesses to occur often,
                  when a man has been six months out of sight of a petticoat."</p>
               <p>"Sir!" said the youth, in a tone of such apparent astonishment at the captain's
                  irreverence, that the latter, as well as the lieutenant, smiled.</p>
               <p>"Why, young gentleman," said the captain, "you are surely not smitten with the
                  charms of this island beauty, are you? Beware, youngster. Keep the fate of Don
                  Juan in remembrance, and beware how you give way to the influence of the charms of
                  this African Haidee, or perhaps you may find a second Lambro in her father or
                  lover, or, perchance, her husband. But, describe the enchantress of the isle, boy.
                  What is she like?"</p>
               <p>"The most lovely creature I ever saw—ever imagined," said the youth. "If Powers'
                  Greek Slave could step from her pedestal imbued with life, she would be nothing to
                  compare with her. No, nor yet the Medicean Venus either, let alone the wax-work
                  beauty in Barnum's Museum."</p>
               <p>Again the captain and lieutenant laughed, and this time heartily. Art length the
                  captain said—</p>
               <p>"A sad descent from your heroics, that lame termination of your comparison, Mr.
                  Miller. A step from the sublime to the ridiculous with a vengeance. However, you
                  have raised my curiosity, and I shall fulfil my intention of paying this
                  extraordinary beauty a visit, I was thinking of taking you on shore again; but I
                  am afraid you will lose your wits altogether, if I again expose you to the Circean
                  wiles of the island enchantress."</p>
               <p>"I hope you will not alter your intention, sir," said the youth, again touching
                  his cap.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," exclaimed the captain, "I see you are resolved not to take waning
                  Into the boat with you then. Mr. Ross (addressing the lieutenant) order the crew
                  into the boat again, sir. I shall be back in the course of an hour."</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, sir," said the lieutenant; and then he added—" My curiosity has been so
                  much excited that I should really like to accompany you on shore, in order to
                  gratify it, Captain P——, if you have no objection."</p>
               <p>"None in the least, Mr. Ross," said the captain—"Tell Mr. Roberts to take charge
                  of the deck and come along."</p>
               <p>Again the boat landed with the new visitors, and the captain and lieutenant were
                  conducted to the house by the young midshipman. They found Miss Herbert seated
                  with Zuleika, and already on very good terms apparently, endeavoring to converse
                  in a mixture of broken Spanish and English, but Jane Miller had disappeared.</p>
               <p>The captain and Mr. Ross were introduced rather through the medium of Miss Herbert
                  than by young Miller. Both were astonished and charmed with the beauty of the
                  island recluse.</p>
               <p>"By Jove!" said Captain P——, aside, to the lieutenant, "Captain Trainer had reason
                  to eulogize the White Lady of Annabon. Who <emph>can</emph> she be? and how did
                  she get here? I should much like to know, and yet it would be rude to ask, even if
                  she would inform us. She seems to be quite alone amongst these rude negroes."</p>
               <p>"There was a lad with her when I first came ashore," interposed young Miller, "who
                  seemed to be on pretty familiar terms with her too; a rough looking chap, dressed
                  like the cabin boy or steward of some merchantman. But I have not seen him this
                  time."</p>
               <p>"He is a very good looking, nay handsome lad," interrupted Miss Herbert; "but he
                  has retired. The lady intimates that he is unwell."</p>
               <p>"You may think him handsome," said the young midshipman; "but for my part I
                  thought him the most ungainly cub I had ever seen."</p>
               <p>"Take care, youngster," said the captain, laughing; "a little while ago, I feared
                  that you had fallen in love with the divinity of this island, and now you are
                  quarreling with Miss Herbert, because she happens to admire a youth of about your
                  age. Really, one would think you wished to engross the admiration of both ladies
                  yourself."</p>
               <p>This conversation had been carried on, in a low voice, while Zuleika sat on an
                  ottoman, at a short distance. She seemed ill at ease, and anxious that her
                  visitors should take their departure; and observing this, the captain and
                  lieutenant rose<pb n="182" xml:id="VAC7191-00000095"/> to take their leave. Miss
                  Herbert and the young midshipman, of course, following their example.</p>
               <p>At this moment a negro attendant entered the room and whispered in the ear of
                  Zuleika.</p>
               <p>"Will you be seated for a moment?" she said in Spanish, which request was
                  translated by Miss Herbert.</p>
               <p>Of course the party resumed their seats and in the course of a few minutes Zuleika
                  returned with a handsome bouquet of flowers which she presented to the captain,
                  who thanked her and bade her farewell. She glanced meaningly at Miss Herbert, who
                  fell behind the party and walked with her to the entrance of the plantation
                  surrounding the cottage.</p>
               <p>"The bouquet was but an excuse to gain time," she said to Miss Herbert. "Here are
                  two letters, one for you and that young gentleman," pointing to young Miller.
                  "Have been written while I was away on the pretext of getting' the flowers—keep it
                  secret that you have got them, and do not read them till you get on board your
                  ship." Utterly astonished as she was at this strange termination of a strange
                  visit, Miss Herbert, of course, gave the required promise, and bidding Zuleika
                  farewell, she hastened to rejoin the party.</p>
               <p>"Well, Miss Herbert," said Captain P——, "has this fairy queen been bestowing her
                  confidence upon you? Can you enlighten us at all, as to who she is, and how she
                  came to be recluse upon this island?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot, sir," said Miss Herbert. "I did endeavor make some inquiries while I
                  was left alone with her, but evaded them and Deemed displeased; so I did not press
                  besides, sometimes we could with difficulty understand other."</p>
               <p>"Well, I adhere to my already expressed supposition regarding her," said the
                  captain, as he stepped into the boat.</p>
               <p>"She certainly is the most beautiful creature I ever said Lieutenant Ross.</p>
               <p>"Hilloa, Ross—what! you smitten too?" exclaimed Captain P——, "why, that's a worse
                  case than that of Mr. Miller. Suppose I write word to Mrs. Ross. What'll she say,
                  when the G—— gets home again?"</p>
               <p>The lieutenant smiled, and replied, "Oh don't be alarmed, sir, I can admire beauty
                  without betraying my fealty to wife."</p>
               <p>"I hope so," said the captain, in a jocose, tone of voice; "but upon my word,
                  Ross, if I were in your wife's shoes, I<pb n=" (Illustration) "

                     <head>ZULEIKA IN HER COTTAGE AT ANNABO.</head>
                     <p>"Of course the party resumed their seats in a few minutes Zuleika returned
                        with a hand some boquet of flowers which she presented to the captain, who
                        thanked her farewell. She glanced meaningly at Miss Herbert who fell behind
                        the party walked with her to the entrance of the plantation surrounding the
                        cottage."</p>

                  <pb n="183" xml:id="VAC7191-00000097"/> shouldn't like you to pay too frequent
                  visits to this paragon of beauty."</p>
               <p>The boat reached the vessel, the captain, officers, and crew, with Miss Herbert,
                  ascended the side; the boat was hoisted in, the main-yard squared, and the ship
                  held in her course.</p>
               <p>Miss Herbert, to the astonishment of young Miller, placed the letter she had
                  received for him, which was sealed while hers was open, in his hand, the first
                  opportunity she had to do so unperceived, saying archly, "From the fair lady of
                  Annabon to Mr. Miller."</p>
               <p>She then sought her own cabin to read her letter—her curiosity to know the
                  contents of the mysterious epistle being of course greatly excited.</p>
               <p>She read it, and her astonishment was redoubled. It was written in a delicate
                  female hand, and ran as follows:</p>
               <p>"Lady, whoever you may be, trust not to him who gave you the ring you wear; he has
                  deceived me and another as well as me. He has caused my utter alienation from all
                  whom I have hitherto held dear; and I fear he has deceived and betrayed another,
                  who is too innocent and guiltless to distrust him. If he has not done so already,
                  he <emph>will</emph> betray you. I know not whether you are on board the
                  man-of-war with the intention of seeking him; but if so, I tell you, he has gone
                  home to America. I will not say what he is for the sake of the innocent being of
                  whom I have spoken, I would not injure him; but, be sure of this, he is not what
                  he represents himself to be. It is not the peaceful occupation of the merchant
                  service he follows—nor is he engaged in duties of the national service—you can
                  make your own comments—I have but done ray duty in warning you.</p>
               <p>"One who has loved and been deceived and betrayed, as I fear you have."</p>
               <p>Again and again did Charlotte Herbert peruse this singular note. "What can she
                  mean? to whom or to what can she allude. He who gave me this ring! (looking at the
                  ring upon her finger.) He is <emph>not what he seems,</emph>' perhaps in one
                  sense, he is not; in one sense I know too truly he is not. 'He <emph>is not in the
                     peaceful merchant service, nor yet engaged in the honorable duties of the
                     national service.</emph>' Well, I know he is not. '<emph>One who has loved and
                     been deceived and betrayed as, I fear, you have.</emph>' Ha! yes, there lies
                  the key to these mysterious warnings—yes, poor girl! <emph>she</emph> has been
                  deceived and betrayed and driven<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7191-00000098"/> to
                  insanity, and perhaps imprisoned on this lone island. That is her secret history,
                  at least the outline of it; perhaps there is a darker mystery beneath its
                  surface.</p>
               <p>"Shall I show this letter to captain P——? No, it would answer no purpose; besides
                  I must recollect he knows nothing of <emph>my</emph> history, other than that I
                  was picked up when at the point of death, by him—after the awful catastrophe on
                  board the ill-fated Laurel. I should like, however, to know what the poor creature
                  could have to say to Mr. Miller. Poor thing! I thought my own sorrows hard enough
                  to bear; but thank heaven my intellect has been spared me. So young, too, and so
                  exquisitely beautiful."</p>
               <p>Miss Herbert folded up her letter, placed it in her pocket, and went on deck to
                  breathe the cool air of the evening, as the vessel was slowly sailing along the
                  land, for the wind was light, and the island of Annabon was still in sight to
                  leeward.</p>
               <p>Let us now discover what was contained in the letter that had been delivered to
                  young Miller. His first thought when the letter was placed in his hand by Miss
                  Herbert, was a very vain and simple one; but after all, a very natural one to a
                  youth of his age, who, to tell the truth, was somewhat proud of his own good
                  looks.</p>
               <p>"So that beautiful creature has fallen in love with me, I guess, or else why
                  should she send me a letter? Well, if I thought so, I'd leave the ship if I could,
                  and get ashore on the island, and live with her always. What a happy life it would
                  be I Nobody to think of but ourselves—nothing to do but to make love to each other
                  continually. I don't wonder at the stories I have heard of sailors running away
                  after the island beauties of the South Seas, and giving up everything for their
                  sakes—that is to say, if they are only half as beautiful as this White Lady of
                  Annabon, as they call her; but of course it isn't to be expected that anybody can
                  be so perfect as she is. I wish my watch on deck was over. My fingers itch to open
                  the letter now, on deck; but I am determined to wait and enjoy it all to myself in
                  the gun-room. I am sure I shall dream of that girl all the watch below—that is, if
                  I get any sleep at all. Heigh-ho! I now begin to experience the truth of that at
                  which I have so often laughed, the torment of being in love; I've often thought
                  I've been in love; but I never felt what love really was until I saw that girl
                  to-day. I wonder who she is? and how she came to be on the island? Perhaps carried
                  there against her will, on account of her beauty. What a gallant thing it would be
                  to rescue her and carry her off. Perhaps she explains in the letter. The watch is
                  nearly out—I've a good mind to go below; I don't think I shall be, wanted or
                  missed from the deck, for I really cannot bear this suspense much longer."</p>
               <p>Thus, in disconnected thoughts, soliloquized the boy of sixteen, elated with the
                  idea of having gained the affections of the most beautiful being he had ever seen
                  or dreamed of; and casting a cautious glance around, and seeing the lieutenant of
                  the watch leaning lazily against the bulwarks, and none of the officers observing
                  him, he resolved to anticipate the end of the watch, and to go below. His foot was
                  already on the rounds of the ladder, when he heard the voice of the captain, who
                  had just come up from his cabin, shouting "Mr. Miller."</p>
               <p>"Here, sir," said the youth, hastily retracing his steps, and concealing the
                  letter which he had withdrawn from his pocket.</p>
               <p>"Jump up aloft, Mr. Miller, and take a spy-glass with you, and sweep the. horizon,
                  and let me know if there are any ships in sight—your eyes are good, especially,
                  look well along the shadow of the land."</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, sir," replied the youthful aspirant to naval honors, compelled to obey
                  and to assume an alacrity he did not feel, and the letter was again placed in his
                  pocket, and in another minute he was aloft and busily engaged in the—at this
                  time—somewhat annoying duty.</p>
               <p>"Do you make out anything?" shouted the captain from the deck.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, sir."</p>
               <p>"That will do, then; you can come down. What o'clock is it Mr. Roberts?"
                  addressing the officer of the watch.</p>
               <p>"Just eight bells, sir. I am going to order the watch to be called."</p>
               <p>The watch below was called; the watch on deck relieved, and at length the young
                  midshipman found the long-coveted opportunity to read the letter he had so
                  strangely received. As he opened the envelope a small package fell from the letter
                  to the deck; he let it lay for the present. The hand was evidently disguised, for
                  the formation of the letters varied considerably, and the first thought of the
                  youth, as he opened the letter, was, "What a pity se beautiful a creature should
                  write such a, clumsy hand. I can hardly spell it out; however, let's see what she
                  says—</p>
               <p>"You have this, day seen the sister whose absence may have<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000099"/> caused much grief to you and to her mother; and
                  yet, perhaps, you have already forgotten her, for you gazed upon her and did not
                  recognize her. Is she so much altered? IS her disguised then so perfect? Perhaps
                  it was so, and yet had there been one sign of recognition, she would have thrown
                  her arms around your neck, and embraced you; through her arms around your neck,
                  and embraced you; though her plans would have been frustrated, and to your
                  feelings as well as to hers, the <emph>expose</emph> might have been
                  painful'——</p>
               <p>"Hilloa! What the d—l's the meaning of this?" exclaimed the youngsters, who had
                  already became initiated into certain sea expletives more expressive than
                  euphonious. "Does that little witch mead to insinuate that she's my sister?" I
                  wish she was—no I don't, though—I'd sooner she was my cousin, or something of that
                  sort. But then she says, '<emph>Is her disguise so perfect?</emph>' That's a
                  little <emph>too</emph> much gammon, by Jove! Does she think that she's going to
                  make me believe that Jane—and poor Jane's a pretty girl, too—could effect so
                  complete a metamorphosis as that? Why, Jane's two inches taller, and stouter, and
                  has dark hair, and features entirely different. No, no—I'm not quite such a
                  simpleton as to be taken in that way. But let's see what more the little gipsy has
                  to say.</p>
               <p>'<emph>There was no occasion for you to have endeavored to speak in a foreign
                     language, of which you are almost entirely ignorant</emph> (very complimentary,
                  certainly); <emph>for, had you spoken English, you would have been, of course,
                     better understood.</emph> (The d—l! How provoking of the little witch. She
                  understands English, and kept me jabbering a parcel of nonsense in a language I
                  hardly know a dozen words of. I dare say she was laughing at time she was
                  pretending to look so serious. Just like the girls, that.) <emph>However, it was
                     better as it was. All is over; perhaps we shall never meet face to face
                     again.</emph> (We shall, if I can manage it.) <emph>I have been induced to
                     write because I wish you to let my mother,</emph> OUR <emph>mother know, and to
                     reveal the fact to her alone, that I am living, and in good bodily
                     health.</emph> (There she is again—off at a tangent. What the mischief can she
                  mean? She's not my sister—I know that well enough—and yet me read to the end.)
                     <emph>And now, dear brother, perhaps I now call you so for the last time</emph>
                  (Ah! Why didn't she say that when I was ashore—I'd have taken a kiss for that, at
                  any rate; but then, what humbug! 'dear brother,' as if she really expected me to
                  believe her. Where was I? ah!) <emph>for the last time. Pray keep this a secret
                     from every</emph>
                  <emph>one. Let no one know</emph> WHERE <emph>you have met me—not even</emph> OUR
                     <emph>mother. Some day we</emph> MAY <emph>meet again; if not, faremell. My
                     prayers and good wishes shall follow yon wherever you may wander—</emph>'and
                  that's all," exclaimed the youth, as he finished the perusal of the letter. "That
                  beats cock-fighting—<emph>our mother!</emph> Why, she's no more like Jane than
                  Miss Herbert is. Poor Jane! I wish I had met her. But how the d—<emph>I could
                     she</emph> know any thing about me? She can't surely be Jane! No, to be sure
                  she isn't—unless she's been transmogrified by some enchanter whose island she has
                  invaded, or is an enchantress herself, like Ariel in the 'Tempest.' It's almost
                  enough to make a fellow believe in such things, to see such a creature as she
                  living by herself in this out of the way part of the world. Halloa! what's this
                  that has fallen from the envelope?" continued the youth, now recollecting the
                  package that had fallen to the deck, and picking it up, he untwisted the paper,
                  which contained some solid substance. "What! by all that's wonderful! here's the
                  ring my mother had upon her finger when I left home—the very same ring—with the
                  first letter of Jane's name engraved inside." (The youth had never seen the ring
                  worn by Miss Herbert, and alluded to in the former letter, as she had only put it
                  on her finger when going ashore, and had removed it on her return on board.)
                  "Well, that caps the climax," continued he, drawing a long breath; "that's a
                  poser, at any rate; there's some magic about it, that's certain. I'll believe any
                  thing now. What's this inside the paper? '<emph>A proof, for my mother, that I am
                     still living. Tom, give it to her, and tell her to wear it for my sake.</emph>'
                  I wonder whether I'm awake or dreaming," said the lad, as he stood in a state of
                  bewilderment, alternately contemplating the ring and the letter. "I'll put it in
                  my pocket, at all events, and see if I can find it there in the morning. Perhaps
                  it may take a journey back again across the Atlantic. Well, I can make nothing of
                  it. Either I'm mad, or the little fairy on the island is mad, or we are all under
                  the influence of enchantment together. I shall turn in;" and the youth sprang into
                  his hammock, and was soon sound asleep. When the watch was called, his first
                  thought was to look for the letter and the ring. He thought he had been
                  dreaming—but no, both were in his pocket. He went on deck, resolving to say
                  nothing about the matter at present to any one. During the day Miss Herbert, whose
                  curiosity had been as much excited as had young Miller's, and who had been almost
                  equally as much puzzled to understand<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7191-00000100"/>
                  the allusions in her letter, sought an opportunity of speaking to the youth, and
                  playfully asked what news he had from the lady of Annabon.</p>
               <p>"News," said the youngster in reply, "why she's either mad or bewitched, or is
                  making a fool of me, one or the other. I don't want to hear anything more about
                  her."</p>
               <p>"Yes," thought Miss Herbert, turning away. "It is evident the poor creature's mad;
                  and yet there seems a 'method in her madness. 'I do wonder who she is, and how she
                  came to be placed in that singular position."</p>
               <p>From that period until the G—— went into Sierra Leone, where Miss Herbert was put
                  on board a vessel bound to New Orleans, the "White Lady of Annabon" was a frequent
                  subject of and jest amongst the officers; it was noticed that young Miller did not
                  like to jest upon the subject, and for that very reason he had to bear still more
                  frequently the rude jokes of his companions.</p>
               <p>He wrote home to his mother and uncle from Sierra Leone, saying nothing, however,
                  to the former with regard to his adventure at Annabon; but in his letter to his
                  uncle to mentioned the visit to the island, and spoke of a very beautiful girl who
                  had lately been discovered to be living there, who he said, jokingly, had set half
                  the captains and officers on the station crazy.</p>
               <p>Let us now shift the scene for a few moments before we wind up this present
                  chapter, and return to the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
               <p>Seymour having sold his cargo and settled his affairs, left his ship in Bahia, to
                  which place he had sailed from Aracati, and paid a visit to Mr. Mordant in New
                  York. There he remained for a considerable time, mingling as usual in the gayeties
                  of the city—still, as ever, the admiration of the ladies and the envy of the
                  beaux. At length the time arrived for him to leave for the purpose of rejoining
                  the Albatross. He was to start on another voyage to the coast of Africa, and he
                  was busily engaged settling affairs relative to the voyage with the merchant, for
                  a day or two previous to his departure. On the last day of his stay, while he was
                  actually closeted with the merchant, a packet of letters, which had just arrived
                  from Sierra Leone, were brought in by a servant. One by one Mr. Mordant took them
                  and read them. At length he lighted upon the one from his nephew.</p>
               <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, "a letter from my nephew Tom. By-the-by the-by, Seymour, I did
                  not tell you. My nephew, Thomas Miller, has got a midshipman's berth on board the
                  G——, and they have sent the boy to the coast. Let's see what the youngster says:"
                  and Mr. Mordant read the letter. He laughed when he came to the account of the
                  recluse of Annabon, and read the paragraph aloud to Seymour, saying when he had
                  finished it, "Have you ever heard of or seen this paragon of perfection,
                  Seymour?"</p>
               <p>"No," said the latter, abruptly. He had started and clenched his teeth and knit
                  his brows, while Mr. Mordant had been reading; but the merchant had not observed
                  him. Now, however, he noticed that he looked pale.</p>
               <p>"You are unwell Seymour?" said he.</p>
               <p>"I don't feel very well; the room is too warm. I will wish you good morning, Mr.
                  Mordant; the air will revive me; I have a slight headache;" and shaking the
                  merchant's hand he left the house.</p>
               <p>"D——tion. Ten thousand curses on the meddling fools!" he exclaimed, hissing the
                  words through his teeth, as he walked towards his lodgings. "So they have found my
                  nest, have they. Let them beware how they meddle with it. Now, I must indeed be
                  off to sea immediately."</p>

                  aloft.</p>
               <p>"On deck there," shouted he; "I think, Senor Capitano, I can just make out the

               <p>The officer thus addressed came down from aloft and joined his superior on the
                  quarter deck.</p>
               <p>The above conversation was carried on on board the Dolphin, after the lucky escape
                  of that vessel from her captors, related in a preceding chapter. The reader is
                  already aware that the officers and crew of the Dolphin comprised men of almost
                  every nation, and though the orders relating to the navigation of the vessel were
                  generally given in English, a running fire of sentences and expletives,
                  alternately given in French, English, and Spanish, characterized the usual
                  conversation of the crew, insomuch that a stranger, suddenly finding himself on
                  board the slaver, would have been under the impression that the owners had manned
                  and officered the vessel from the Tower of Babel.</p>
               <p>It was a fine starlight night; all possible sail was set, and studding sails
                  spread alow and aloft, for the wind had veered around to the eastward, and was
                  blowing a fine six knot breeze, and Captain Junot and his <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >contremaistre</foreign> were in high spirits at having escaped so fortunately
                  from under the guns of the man of war.</p>
               <p>"What is your pleasure, Senor, with regard to those devils the Englishman put on
                  board as a prize crew?" asked Paez of the captain.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ah! diable.</foreign> I had forgotten them. Bring the
                  dogs up from the hold. How many of our crew are hurt?"</p>
               <p>"Two were killed by the English sailors, while endeavoring to seize and overpower
                  them, and one more severely hurt."</p>
               <p>"Ha! who are they?"</p>
               <p>"Peters and Bruneau are killed, and the negro Quashy will hardly live till
                  daylight in the morning."</p>
               <p>"Three of our best men," said the captain. "Go, fetch the dogs upland I will
                  interrogate them," he added savagely, and the mate retired to obey the order.</p>
               <p>Captain Junot stood leaning against the railing of the quarter deck, gazing
                  savagely, and still with an air of exultation, upon the Water, as it seemed to
                  flash with phosphorescent light past the vessel.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">contremaistre</foreign> reappeared up
                  the hatchway, accompanied by two seamen as ferocious looking as himself, and
                  followed by the master's mate and the six English sailors, pale and weak from the
                  loss of blood from the severe wounds they had received in the struggle that had
                  been made to overpower them, their faces and clothing stained with the sanguinary
                  tide, and so heavily ironed that it was with difficulty they could drag their
                  limbs along to the quarter deck.</p>
               <p>As they emerged, one by one, from the hatchway, savage and sinister glances were
                  cast upon them by a score of villainous countenances, and as they passed the booby
                  hatch, upon which, covered over with canvas, lay the bodies of the dead pirates,
                  several harsh voices hoarsely muttered, "Blood for blood. The plank, the plank!
                  Throw the cursed hounds overboard to the sharks!"</p>
               <p>It seemed doubtful, even, whether they would reach the quarter deck, without the
                  vengeance of the savage crew anticipating the judgment of their no less savage
                  commander. Desperate wretches clustered round them, and the glitter of knives
                  could be discerned amidst the semi-darkness, for the brief twilight of the tropics
                  had already almost flitted away, and the stars which had for the previous half
                  hour faintly shone in the clear sky, now sparkled brilliantly in the dark azure
                  vault of heaven—but Paez, who was a man of gigantic stature and of immense
                  physical power, dealt severe blows with his fist upon those who approached
                  nearest, and the men held back, muttering dark and deadly curses between their
                  teeth.</p>
               <p>"Back with ye, men—back, I say! If another offers to interfere with the course of
                  justice, by the holy Virgin, I'll send him to h—l before his time. You shall have
                  justice, men, and Peters and Bruneau shall be revenged; but it must be meted out
                  formally by the captain. Here are the prisoners," added Paez, addressing the
                  captain.</p>
               <p>Captain Junot looked up from the water and glanced at the captives; his small
                  bloodshot eyes, gleaming like coals of fire from beneath his heavy, ragged,
                  grizzled eyebrows. There was a demoniacal ferocity in his, steady gaze, which
                  foretold the doom of the wretched prisoners before he spoke. Their blood ran chill
                  with horror; but they endeavored to bear themselves bravely, and to maintain an
                  appearance of outward composure—though one or two of them were so exhausted with
                  loss of blood that they reeled like drunken men as they stood before their savage
                  captor.</p>
               <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7191-00000102"/>
               <p>"You are the officer of the party, I see by your attire?" said the captain, after
                  he had silently gazed at the prisoners for some moments, addressing the master's
                  mate, whose name was Richards.</p>
               <p>"I am," replied the young man.</p>
               <p>"What death do you deserve to die, dog, for having caused the death of two of my
                  best hands?"</p>
               <p>"The men were killed by us in self-defence and in the fulfilment of our duty,"
                  boldly replied the officer.</p>
               <p>"Ha! so you think, perhaps; but men entertain different ideas of duty. What was it
                  to you or your cursed captain, that we were engaged in the slave trade? What right
                  have you to make or meddle with us?"</p>
               <p>"The right that justice and humanity bestows," replied the young man.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Bah!</emph> Don't talk to me of justice and humanity. You shall have
                  justice meted out to you shortly. As to humanity, it is only fool's talk. Two of
                  you must die, to revenge the death of two men of my crew who have fallen by your
                  hands, and if the negro Quashy dies, so surely shall another of you suffer death;
                  but on one condition I will save <emph>your</emph> life, as the officer of the
                  party. Inform me of every particular relative to the number and strength of the
                  cruisers, English and American, that are upon the coast."</p>
               <p>"I will accept of no conditions from you or such as you," said the officer boldly,
                  though his heart shrunk within him as he spoke, for he was a young man of scarcely
                  twenty years of age, and life was dear to him, and his future career brilliant
                  with the high hopes and anticipations of youth; but, he felt that he had his duty
                  to perform as an officer and an example to show his unfortunate companions—he felt
                  that to accept conditions for his life from a pirate, would be to tarnish his
                  honor forever, and then that death were preferable.</p>
               <p>"Hound, do you dare to taunt me thus," said the captain savagely, and he stepped
                  forward and struck the youth across the mouth with the hilt of his cutlass, "take
                  that, and learn to keep a civil tongue in your head."</p>
               <p>A murmur of savage applause was heard from the lips of the seamen who were looking
                  on, as they witnessed this brutal act of the captain's.</p>
               <p>"Strip off the fellow's jacket and search his pockets; perhaps he has papers or
                  letters with him that may be of service," said Captain Junot, whose passion was
                  now roused to demoniacal fury.</p>
               <p>A couple of seamen threw themselves upon the unfortunate youth and bore him to the
                  deck; his jacket was stripped off and searched, but nothing was found.</p>
               <p>A locket suspended from his neck, which had hitherto been concealed by his vest,
                  attracted the attention of the captain. "What is that?" said he. "Pull it off." It
                  was done, and the locked containing a lock of hair and the portrait of a dark-blue
                  eyed girl, was given into the monster's hands by his ready satellites.</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! a pretty piece of goods. I wish I had her here," exclaimed the captain,
                  and then throwing the trinket upon the deck he crushed it beneath the heel of his
                  heavy sea boot.</p>
               <p>"Now, dog of an Englishman, will you sue for your life?" demanded the brutal
                  pirate chief, compelling the youth to rise to his feet.</p>
               <p>"Never," responded the young officer.</p>
               <p>"Then take that," exclaimed the captain, dealing a heavy blow with the edge of his
                  cutlass, which he had drawn from the scabbard, upon the unprotected head of the
                  youth!</p>
               <p>The blade sunk deep into the skull of the unhappy captive, cleaving it in twain;
                  there was a groan of mortal agony, a horrible crushing sound, and the dead body
                  fell heavily to the deck, amidst the pool of blood which had gushed in torrents
                  from the frightful wound.</p>
               <p>"Heave the carrion overboard," said the captain, and the order was promptly
                  obeyed.</p>
               <p>"Now, dogs that you are, you see what justice I deal out," said the captain, whom
                  the sight of blood appeared to have driven to Insanity. "Mark the sign of the
                  cross upon your foreheads with that blood, and swear to embrace our trade, and
                  your lives shall be spared, all but two—two must die to avenge the deaths of my
                  own men; but for that you shall cast lots. What say you?"</p>
               <p>"Never," feebly responded the unhappy men, for they were sick with horror at the
                  sight they had witnessed.</p>
               <p>"Your blood be upon your own hands, then," exclaimed the Captain—and the men who
                  had gradually crowded closer and closer upon the quarter deck, murmured in harsh,
                  savage voices, "blood for blood."</p>
               <p>"Sailmaker," shouted Captain Junot, "are the dead men's hammocks ready and
                  shotted?"</p>
               <p>"All ready, sir," responded the sailmaker—a Portuguese seaman whose complexion was
                  bronzed to the color of a negro.</p>
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7191-00000103"/>
               <p>"Then, Senor Paez, take two of these men and place them back to back with the dead
                  bodies of Peters and Bruneau, and sew them up in the hammocks, and when you are
                  ready throw them overboard—and carpenter (shouting to that functionary) rig the
                  plank—the other four shall walk overboard. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ma,
                     foi!</foreign> but tine sharks shall have a feast to-night."</p>
               <p>Two of the unfortunate seamen, unable, to offer any resistance, were seized by the
                  wretches of pirates and bound back to back—living men with the corpses of the
                  dead—and the hammocks toeing sewed around them, heavily shotted, they were laid,
                  struggling with mortal terror, near the gangway.</p>
               <p>The "plank," meanwhile, had been rigged by the carpenter and his willing
                  assistants. It was a smooth piece of board, about eight feet long, which was
                  accurately balanced and secured by a tackle across the gangway. A weight of about
                  a hundred pounds was fastened to the end which hung in-board; so that until the
                  weight of a man's body approached the outward extremity, it would not top over.
                  This plank was raised by some of the crew, and the two hammocks, with their dead
                  and living freight, were launched from it into the deep. Pale with horror, the
                  unhappy remnant of the captives witnessed this frightful scene, and stood silently
                  awaiting their turn, for they felt that any appeal for mercy from the demons in
                  human form by whom they were surrounded, would be in vain; but the scene of
                  hellish horror was not yet ended; it needed yet some further embellishment of
                  Pandemoniacal cruelty.</p>
               <p>"Bring Quashy from his hammock," shouted the captain, and the negro, his usually
                  black complexion changed to a sickly yellow—frightful to look upon, and his
                  features distorted with pain, was brought up and supported by two of his negro
                  messmates in a position to view the tragedy that was being enacted.</p>
               <p>"Now, men," said Captain Junot, addressing his brutal crew, "and you, too, Quashy;
                  see how I avenge any injury offered to you. Peters and Bruneau have been revenged,
                  Quashy; these others die to satisfy your vengeance. Draw out two boarding-pikes"
                  (addressing two seamen who stood near him).</p>
               <p>The sharp instruments were brought from the row which glittered in the bracket
                  around the mainmast.</p>
               <p>"And now, dogs," said the captain to the hapless seamen, "walk that plank. What!
                  you won't. Then drive them with the pikes," added the captain to the two seamen
                  who held the weapons in their hands; and the sharp points of the pikes were
                  applied to the backs of the wretched, hapless captives, until they shrieked with
                  agony, while the blood coursed in streams from the wounds. Goaded to desperation,
                  the half-maddened seamen—to whom a speedy death was now the greatest mercy—stepped
                  upon the fatal plank, and walked to the opposite end; it tilted with their weight,
                  and in another moment, amidst the scouts, and taunts, and jeers of the demon crew,
                  they were lurched into the yielding waters; the irons fastened to their legs bore
                  them down, the waters closed above them, and the ship passed on; and the stars
                  shone forth as clearly, and the water sparkled as brilliantly with the
                  phosphorescent light as though no such deed of horror had happened.</p>
               <p>"Get water and wash these stains of blood from the deck," said the captain; but
                  the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">contremaistre</foreign> directed his attention to the
                  negro, who had been torn from his hammock to witness the consummation of the foul
                  tragedy. He was dead in the arms of his supporters.</p>
               <p>"Throw him overboard with the rest," said the captain, laughing brutally, "he is
                  only a negro, after all, and he has been revenged."</p>
               <p>And the body of Quashy plashed into the water and floated past, bobbing up and
                  down in the wake of the vessel, for no shot had been fastened to <emph>him.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>A murmur of disapprobation arose from the negro portion of the crew; but they
                  comprised a minority and were held in subjection by the rest, and they were soon
                  quieted.</p>
               <p>Captain Junot descended to his cabin with the air of a man who had carried out a
                  decree of justice. Thus were the fears of Captain Trainer, of the Rapid, verified,
                  and the expectations of Captain P——, that the slaver captain would not dare to
                  treat the captives with cruelty, proved faulty. Few men can conceive the condition
                  of utter callousness to human suffering that the hearts of those engaged in the
                  slave trade are inured to.</p>
               <p>It was the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">contremaistre's</foreign> watch on deck, and
                  Captain Junot, having descended to his cabin after the enaction of the horrid
                  cruelties we have described, poured out a tumbler half full of brandy, and
                  drinking it off at a draught, threw himself upon a sofa and was soon in a heavy
                  slumber, which continued until the watch was relieved at midnight</p>
               <p>But a change of scene had taken place overhead, although no symptom of the change
                  was apparent in the cabin, save that<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7191-00000104"/>
                  the sound of the water was no longer heard plashing against the sides as the ship
                  gallantly ploughed her path through the yielding element. All was hushed, silent,
                  ominously still, and although the stern windows of the cabin were open, the heat
                  was oppressive, and almost stifling, for no longer the cooling breeze rushed in
                  from the ocean. The captain glanced out of the cabin windows, and then seemed to
                  awaken to the presence of some approaching evil. With an oath upon his lips he
                  rushed upon deck. The vessel was lying motionless upon the water; her sails
                  flapping heavily and lazily against the mast, but none of them taken in. The stars
                  which had beamed so brightly from the dark azure canopy of heaven upon the late
                  scene of blood and horror, had vanished, and the sky was as dark as pitch; a
                  lead-colored haze, so dense as to seein almost palpable, pervaded the atmosphere,
                  and the ocean had lost its late phosphorescent brilliancy, and became dark and
                  turgid. The watch had been relieved before the change had occurred, although it
                  was not yet a quarter of an hour past midnight; but in these latitudes the changes
                  come on suddenly; the mate in charge of the deck—who had never before visited the
                  coast, having been shipped in Havana on a recommendation from a slave merchant, on
                  account of his reckless ferocity (he had for some years pursued the career of a
                  pirate in the Greek Archipelago)—had failed to take warning by the change while
                  the crew, stretched here and there about the decks, under the lee of the bulwarks,
                  soundly sleeping, or listlessly lounging over the railing of the vessel, were
                  gazing carelessly and thoughtlessly into the dark water.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mon Dieu! Sacre mille tonneres; mais nous aurons un
                     veritable pampero!</foreign>" exclaimed Captain Junot, and cursing the apathy
                  of the officer in charge, he ordered that all hands should be called immediately,
                  and sail taken in as rapidly as possible.</p>
               <p>The pamperos, or hurricanes peculiar to the coast of Africa, like the typhoons of
                  the East Indies, come on suddenly, only giving warning by the wind dying away and
                  the sky and the sea assuming an ashy hue, while the atmosphere becomes oppressive
                  in the extreme. This ominous calm is the precursor of torrents of rain, followed
                  by terrific squalls of wind, accompanied by thunder and lightning of the most
                  startling and vivid description. It is customary in such cases, when there is
                  plenty of sea room, to take in all possible sail, and allow the ship to run
                  directly before the gale, which sometimes lasts but an hour or two; although, when
                  the pampero is of unusual violence, it endures for as many days.</p>
               <p>There was still hope that before the rain came on there might be time to clew up
                  the sails, and all hands were now fully aroused to the critical nature of their
                  position. The negro boys were ordered aloft to furl the royals and take in the
                  topgallant studding sails, the topgallant sails were clewed up, and the topsail
                  halyards let go by the run, preparatory to being furled; when a strange rushing
                  sound, like that of a cataract that had been dammed up, suddenly broken loose, and
                  precipitated with resistless fury over a valley beneath, was heard to the
                  northwestward; then came a vivid flash of lightning, and a peal of deafening
                  thunder, and the cry arose from a score of voices at once, "The pampero—the
                  pampero is upon us!"</p>
               <p>The order was given to put the vessel before the wind, which was expected to come
                  from the quarter whence the sound of the approaching rain and the first peal of
                  thunder had been heard; but the ship was too much encumbered with sail, and the
                  wind, almost as soon as the first heavy rain-drops pattered upon the deck, burst
                  upon them with such violence that it was found impracticable to obey the order.
                  The ship would not answer her helm, the waves rose as rapidly as the wind, and the
                  vessel was thrown into the trough of the sea.</p>
               <p>"Aloft there! you lazy, lubberly, black rascals—bear a hand and furl those
                  royals," shouted the captain, through his speaking trumpet. "Hurry, men,
                  hurry—roll up the sails—cut, cut them adrift with your knives if you cannot furl
                  them," he added, his voice rising to a shrill shriek, as he repeated his
                  orders—the danger becoming every moment more imminent; but his shouts were
                  unheard—had they been heard they would have been alike unheeded; for the men were
                  blinded and bewildered by the rain driven horizontally by the force of the wind,
                  and cutting the flesh like hail, and by the quickly succeeding flashes of blue
                  lightning which illumined the midnight darkness, as if the glare of a thousand
                  torches had suddenly gleamed from the dark sky, disclosing the laboring vessel,
                  struggling like a living thing in mortal agony, amidst a sea of foam, and
                  rendering the succeeding darkness blacker still, and more terrific. And now the
                  peals of thunder rolled almost continuously over the heads of the bewildered and
                  frightened seamen, louder than the roar of a thousand parks of artillery—so loud,
                  so deafening, that even the wind foe the moment seemed to lull as if its fury was
                  appalled and controlled<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7191-00000105"/> by the terrific
                  confusion of the atmosphere above. In one of these lulls a sharp crackling sound
                  was heard aloft; and a cry as of some one shrieking in mortal terror. A bright
                  flash of lightning lit up the scene, and those on deck cast their eyes aloft.
                  Black forms were seen clinging with all their might to the yards and rigging, for
                  those who had gone aloft, in obedience to the order of the captain, to furl the
                  sails, had not only found themselves powerless to effect this, but were prevented
                  by the of the wind from descending to the deck—and on they clung to their
                  treacherous, precarious tenure with a clutch like that of drowning men; but whence
                  that cry? The vessel had rolled heavily over to windward during the temporary
                  lull, and in again making a corresponding lurch to leeward, snapped like whip
                  cord, and the masts themselves, no longer able to bear the forces of the wind,
                  splintered and rocked to and fro, and at last, with a sudden crash, snapped
                  asunder, and fell over, dangling backward and forwards in mid air—hanging by the
                  lee rigging. Some of the hapless wretches who had so long clung helplessly to this
                  frail tenure were at once precipitated into the boiling ocean, falling in the
                  darkness, and amid the wild confusion of the elements, unseen, unheard, unheeded
                  by their comrades below. Others still clung with the energy of the despair to the
                  dangling wreck; but they could not long retain their hold; some were crushed
                  between the masts and yards, as the spars swung to and fro; others were shaken
                  off—even the desperate strength lent them by despair, no longer enabling their
                  numbed and paralyzed figures to retain their hold; they, too, fell one into the
                  seething, foaming ocean caldron beneath; some unseen amid the blackness of the
                  night; the dark falling of others recognized for a moment in the lightning's red
                  unearthly glare; but the situation of those on deck was too dangerous for them to
                  take heed of the peril of their shipmates. <emph>They</emph> were not men to
                  trouble themselves at any time about the distress or agony of others; least of all
                  now, when they stood clinging to the bulwarks in momentary dread of being
                  themselves swept from the deck by some mighty wave. A mortal dread seized the
                  minds of all, for when death threatened them face to face, the evils of a misspent
                  life, darkened by deeds of savage cruelty, such as the wild beasts of the forest
                  wot not of—such as are only conceived in the brains of savage men, rushed to their
                  memory and completely unnerved them; there were some who thought that the
                  cruelties the evening of that fearful night had witnessed had brought upon them
                  this judgment—that the blood of the murdered seamen had called for vengeance and
                  aroused to fury the spirit of the storm—they fancied they heard unearthly
                  howlings, and gibberings, and chatterings in the air, mingling with the noise of
                  the tempest, and believed these sounds to issue from the spirits of the murdered,
                  laughing at the doom which seemed to await the murderers.</p>
               <p>Yet, were they not all alike, even in their terror. Some clung to the bulwarks or
                  lashed themselves to the stancheons, and awaited with sullen gloom their apparant
                  fate. Others wept and prayed, and swore, and groaned in the agony of mortal
                  terror; others were rife in promises of amendment; and some who, now in their
                  fright, believed firmly in the efficacy of mediation with the Being they scorned
                  to acknowledge in their pride and prosperity, made vows and promised gifts to
                  their patron saints and to the Holy Virgin, if only this once they were delivered
                  from peril. Amongst these last was the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >contremaistre,</foreign> who loudly promised to purchase half a dozen of the
                  biggest wax candles he could procure, and place them before the altar of the
                  chapel of the Virgin in his native town at Sagova, in Spain, if he were allowed
                  once again to set his feet on dry land.</p>
               <p>More heavily still the ship labored in the trough of the sea; her planks were
                  strained to a degree that rendered it certain that she must be leaking fast, yet
                  none dared venture to sound the pumps. And now the sea began to pour over the
                  deck, sweeping away the boats, and tearing away the bulwarks as though the tough
                  oak plank were pasteboard. And at every sweep some victim was carried off into the
                  boiling sea, his wild shriek of despair mingling with the howling of the wind and
                  the roar of the thunder.</p>
               <p>And now a flash of red and blue lightning, so vivid that it seemed to sear the
                  eyeballs, and scorch out the eyesight of all who witnessed it, struck the deck
                  amidships, near the chain-locker, and passed, hissing along the wet chain-cable,
                  and dealing death to all with whom it came in contact, escaped by the hawse-holes.
                  The flash was followed immediately by a clap of thunder, which seemed to burst
                  forth from the verge of the horizon to windward, and to pass immediately over the
                  vessel, increasing in loudness as it drew near, crashing and rolling and crashing
                  again, as it passed away to leeward, with a sound as if the mountains of the earth
                  were rent asunder by a thousand<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7191-00000106"/>
                  explosions, and the fragments dashed in wild confusion one against the other. The
                  wind was stilled; even the sea was calmed with the terrible concussion, and the
                  ship trembled in every plank. All thought that their hour was come. For a moment
                  their prayers and tears, and groans and promises were hushed; their eyes were
                  blinded with the lightning, yet they seemed to gaze upon each other in blank, mute
                  despair. The idea that now all was over seemed to flash through the brains of the
                  survivors of that lately numerous, reckless and savage crew, but the silence was
                  but for a moment— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Then shrieked the timid and stood still the brave,</l>
                        <l>While some leaped overboard, with dreadful yell,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1"> As eager to anticipate the grave."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The words of the poet were literally fulfilled, for that night of terror had
                  driven some to madness, and half a dozen of the crew leaped into the sea, while
                  the distant roar of the awful thunder peal, still faintly heard, sounded their
                  requiem, and rushing waters joined with the howling winds in dismal chorus. The
                  boldest now waited in momentary expectation of the vessel foundering; but they
                  were spared. The storm had spent its fury, and the discordant elements seemed to
                  have exhausted themselves in that last fearful shock; the wind lulled—the sea
                  gradually went down, and the Dolphin, a mere wreck of her former pride and beauty,
                  still floated in safety upon the troubled waters. Of the crew of fifty men but
                  seventeen remained; the rest had been washed from the decks or had fallen
                  overboard from aloft. The carpenter sounded the pump-well; the ship was stout and
                  strong; notwithstanding the wrenching her planks had sustained, there were only
                  eighteen inches of water in the hold; this leak could be easily kept under. Hope
                  revived within the breast of the captain and the remnant of the crew. They would
                  yet reach Cuba in safety. But the slaves—the miserable wretches cooped up in the
                  hold throughout the storm—how had they fared while the ship had been tossed like a
                  child's toy upon the waters? As soon as the necessary work had been done to enable
                  the half disabled vessel to proceed on her course—as soon as the wreck aloft had
                  been cleared away, the torn sails unbent and replaced by fresh ones, and the
                  vessel pumped dry, Captain Junot thought of the living freight below, upon the
                  safety and health of whom the success of his voyage depended.</p>
               <p>The hatches were removed, and Paez, accompanied by two other seamen, descended to
                  the spar deck. God! what an awful sight met their view. The storm had done its
                  work upon the unhappy negroes; the retribution which had fallen upon the guilty
                  seamen had involved destruction to their hapless victims. As is too often the case
                  in this world, the innocent had suffered with the guilty. The staples by which the
                  negroes were bound to the deck had given way, and they had been tumbled violently
                  one against the other, pell-mell, in dreadful confusion. The breath had been
                  crushed out of some of the more weakly—they had died of suffocation; the limbs of
                  others were broken; and again, others, especially the children, had fallen victims
                  to the foul and confined air they had been compelled to breathe—for the hatches
                  had been securely battened down and covered tightly with tarpaulins, so that a
                  breath of fresh air could not enter the closely packed hold. The stench that arose
                  when the hatches were lifted was insupportable; even the brutal and practised Paez
                  recoiled from it; until, by admission of the fresh breeze, the hold had become in
                  some measure purified. Then he set to work to count the number of the dead, the
                  dying, and the helplessly maimed. Thirty were hoisted upon deck dead and
                  disfigured; ten others, who still breathed, but who were evidently drawing their
                  last breath, were added to the list, and twelve had their legs and arms broken so
                  as to render them useless. These, too, were hoisted upon deck and examined by the
                  captain. Fifty-two in all. So much loss on the profits of the voyage! With a
                  fearful oath Captain Junot ordered them to be thrown overboard-the dead, the
                  dying, and the maimed together. In vain were the shrieks, the cries of agony of
                  the wretched beings, as they implored for mercy; their appeals only called forth
                  brutal jests and curses from the crew, and Paez was so irritated at the loss that
                  he swore that he wouldn't give the Virgin the candles he had promised her. Still
                  there were hopes that two hundred slaves might be landed in Cuba.</p>
               <p>Another vessel had ridden out the gale in company with the Dolphin, although she
                  had been too far distant for either to see the other—and she had not suffered as
                  the Dolphin had: for proper precautions had been taken; her sails had been furled
                  in time, and she had been "hove to," under her storm jib and mizen staysail. As
                  day began to break, the captain of this vessel—the Buzzard, British
                  sloop-of-war—had ordered more sail to be set, and the vessel proceeded on her
                  course.</p>
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7191-00000107"/>
               <p>"It has been an awfully rough night, master," said the captain, addressing that
                  officer; "I am used to the coast, and I don't know when I have experienced a more
                  severe pampero. I pity the fate of those who have been caught in it, at the
                  outset, unawares."</p>
               <p>"Most of the traders here are accustomed to look out for these hurricanes," was
                  the reply of the master.</p>
               <p>"Sail ho-o-of" shouted the look-out man, from aloft.</p>
               <p>"Where away?" shouted the master, in reply.</p>
               <p>"Dead to leeward, sir; she has nothing but her topmasts standing, and appears to
                  be disabled."</p>
               <p>"Take the spyglass aloft, master," said the captain, "and see what you can make of
                  her; see if she shows any signals; whether or not, if she is disabled, we will
                  bear down towards her."</p>
               <p>The sea was running high, and the master started aloft, and looked in the
                  direction pointed out by the seaman.</p>
               <p>"What do you make her out to be, master?" shouted the captain.</p>
               <p>"A merchantman in distress, I rather think, sir; she has carried away her
                  top-gallant masts in the gale of last night, most likely, and the crew are bending
                  new sails. She is close to, and you might see her easily from the deck, if the sea
                  were to go down a little more, or if her topgallant masts were a-taunto."</p>
               <p>"We Will bear down and see if she wants aid," said the captain; and he ordered the
                  yards to be squared, and the course to be altered directly for the stranger.</p>
               <p>In less than half an hour she was distinctly visible from the deck, still rolling
                  heavily in the trough of the sea, for want of sufficient sail.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the captain of the Dolphin—for, as the reader will have
                  surmised, it was she that had been discovered in her crippled state by the
                  sloop-of-war—had Seen the Buzzard bearing down towards him, and had made her out
                  to be a ship-of-war He cursed, and stormed; and raved, and tore his hair in his
                  frantic rage.</p>
               <p>"Another of those cursed cruisers," said he; "they swarm thick as bees. Oh! That I
                  had power to annihilate them and sink them to h—l."</p>
               <p>"What's to be done now, Senor?" asked the contremaistre. "We shall be overhauled,
                  that's certain; and if we are caught with these negroes on board"—</p>
               <p>"The ship will be taken as a prize," interrupted the captain, "and we shall be
                  hanged as pirates, for if we are taken into port, the dead will rise up against
                  us. We shall have to account for the prize crew of the brig-of-war.</p>
               <p>"The negroes must go overboard. It is a pity—an infernal pity. We shall make a
                  ruinous voyage altogether—nothing but bad luck from beginning to end," said the
                  centremaistre.</p>
               <p>"It must be so," answered Junot. "There is no help for it. It is their lives or
                  ours—but—I'll be revenged yet."</p>
               <p>The danger was imminent. The man-of-war was not a mile distant. She would soon be
                  within hail, and then all would be lost. Without another word the contremaistre
                  descended with a dozen of the crew into hold. Shot were fastened to the feet of
                  the miserable victims, and they were rapidly passed out of the port holes to
                  leeward, so that the work of death going on should not be observed by those on
                  board the sloop-of-war. Of all the negroes that less than twenty-four hours before
                  filled the spar deck, but two were retained. These were the two negro children
                  already spoken of as belonging to the Yunga Jagos woman, who had escaped from the
                  Albatross and been carried to Liberia by the Firefly, by the crew of which vessel,
                  the reader will recollect she was rescued. These children Captain Junot had taken
                  a fancy to; they were quite young, and were handed up to him, fast asleep, by the
                  mate and placed by the captain in his own state-room berth, where he thought they
                  would be safe from the observation of the officers of the man-of-war, even if they
                  should insist on searching his vessel.</p>
               <p>The man-of-war was within hail—"What ship is that?" asked the captain, through his
                  trumpet.</p>
               <p>"The French ship Bienfaisant, from Dominique, bound to the coast for ivory,"
                  replied Captain Junot. "We have been crippled in the gale last night."</p>
               <p>"Do you want any assistance?" asked the captain of the sloop-of-war.</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you; we shall do very well. We shall run before the wind until our
                  repairs are completed, and then we shall shape our course for the Coast
                  again."</p>
               <p>"I wish you success and better luck in future," said the captain of the
                  man-of-war; and so saying, he waved farewell with his trumpet and gave orders for
                  the sails to be trimmed, and the course to be changed.</p>
               <p>"That's fortunate," said Captain Junot, as he saw the man-of-war<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000108"/> of-war making preparations to stand on her proper
                  course.</p>
               <p>"Oh, what a cursed fool I was to throw those negroes over board."</p>
               <p>But the slaver captain had reckoned without his host. A lieutenant advanced to the
                  captain of the sloop-of-war, and said:—</p>
               <p>"I am greatly mistaken, sir, if that vessel is not a slaver. I could almost swear
                  to having chased her upwards of a twelve month ago. If she be the vessel I expect
                  she is, one of the most desperate fellows that ever lived commands her—a Frenchman
                  of the name of Junot."</p>
               <p>"Ha! say you so, Mr. Howard," said the captain. "In that case we may as well send
                  a boat on board; but unless we have proof that she has slaves on board we can't
                  search her. The vessel you speak of sails, I believe, under American colors."</p>
               <p>"She does, sir; but she may have slaves now on board."</p>
               <p>"Ten thousand curses on them; they are going to board us after all, said Junot, as
                  he saw the mainyard of the sloop-of-war thrown aback, and a boat lowered; but let
                  them come, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Sacre tonnere!</foreign> they can find
                  nothing."</p>
               <p>In a few moments the boat was alongside, and the lieutenant already spoken of,
                  ascended to the deck.</p>
               <p>"I should like to see your papers," said he to the captain, significantly.</p>
               <p>"You shall see them," said Junot (he carried false papers already prepared), and
                  these he showed the officer. They answered the Description he had given of his
                  vessel when he had first been hailed.</p>
               <p>The officer looked disappointed and was preparing to return to his ship, when a
                  man rushed out from the forecastle, and begged the officer to remove him from the
                  ship. "Hang me at the yard arm, if you will," said the man; "do what you will with
                  me, but remove me hence. This vessel is a slaver—a pirate, I have served in many a
                  slaver; I have become accustomed to scenes of bloodshed; but on board this craft I
                  have seen sights which have chilled my blood with horror. Seven of your countrymen
                  have been murdered by that man (pointing to the captain) within the last
                  twenty-four hours, and not half an how since two hundred negroes were cast
                  overboard. The Dolphin is a hell afloat, and Captain Junot is worse than the
                  devil. If you want more proof—if you won't believe my word—search the cabin; two
                  negro clildren—all that are left—are concealed there. But don't leave me here,"
                  and the man shuddered with horror and affright.</p>
               <p>"The Dolphin! Captain Junot! eh? said the officer; "as I suspected. I have long
                  sought to make your acquaintance, Captain Junot. With your leave, I'll proceed to
                  search the vessel. You (addressing the sailor) can go at once into the boat, my
                  man."</p>
               <p>"You shall suffer for this," said Junot, vindictively. "You have no right to
                  search my ship."</p>
               <p>"Never mind, my good fellow, we shall see. I shall at any rate secure you on the
                  charge of murder. I hope you will be able to prove your innocence."</p>
               <p>Seeing that remonstrance was useless, and knowing that under the guns of the
                  sloop-of-war force would be equally so, Captain Junot resolved to submit with the
                  best grace he could. He trusted to the silence, for their own sakes, of the rest
                  of the crew, and hoped that the evidence of the witness would be disbelieved, and
                  that <emph>he</emph> himself would not be recognized. He had got clear of many
                  awkward scrapes through the good friend to whom the recusant sailor had aptly
                  compared him. He hoped to get clear of this, though he felt that things looked
                  awkward enough just now.</p>
               <p>The two children were found in the cabin, and were sent on board the man-of-war,
                  and the boat returning with the officer, a strong prize crew was sent on board the
                  slaver. Captain Junot and his crew were carried on board the sloop-of-war and put
                  in irons, to await their trial at Sierra Leone, whither the captain of the
                  man-of-war determined at once to proceed.</p>

                  <p>Seymour revisits Annabon, and finds an unwelcome visitor</p>
               </argument>
               <p>CAPTAIN SEYMOUR experienced strange sensations of vague alarm at hearing of the
                  invasion of the solitudes of Annabon. The very day after he had received the
                  intelligence conveyed to Mr. Mordant in his nephew's letter, he set sail in the
                  steamer which happened to be leaving at that time for St. Thomas, and thence he
                  proceeded to the Brazils. Arrived at Bahia, he found the Albatross refitted and
                  ready for sea; and taking his stores on board immediately, he cleared out the
                     following<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7191-00000109"/> lowing day with Brazilian
                  papers, and sailed on his voyage, his destination being to the same port in
                  Loango, whence he had in two previous voyages received his cargo of human
                  flesh.</p>
               <p>But Captain Seymour had other ends in view besides the mere prosecution of a
                  slaving voyage, on this occasion, the object of which will be in due time
                  developed. He had left America in consequence of the news he had received some
                  weeks previously to his original intention, for he did not expect that his agents
                  at Majumba, and Quaddah, and other noted slave depots, would have a cargo ready
                  for him so early as the period at which he now expected to arrive. Consequently,
                  he resolved to sail to the northern and principal harbor on the island of Annabon,
                  and leaving his vessel there, to proceed to the abode of Zuleika, and perhaps
                  remain; there a week or two, as circumstances might decide, before he again sailed
                  for Majumba.</p>
               <p>Nothing worthy of note occurred during the passage across the Atlantic, and in
                  five weeks after leaving Bahia, the Albatross—the captain first reconnoitering to
                  ascertain that the coast was clear—came to anchor off the only port in
                  Annabon.</p>
               <p>Leaving instructions with Mr. Tolcroft to be on his guard against surprise, on the
                  coast—for, although there was no dagger of capture to be apprehended, under the
                  present circumstances, the Albatross having, already observed, a regular clearance
                  from a Brazilian port—still Seymour had no desire that his arrival on the coast
                  should be known to the captains of the British and American cruisers, and
                  suspicions thus raised which might lead to unpleasant results; for he knew,
                  although personally unknown to any of the officers of the men-of-war, that both
                  his ship and himself were notorious for their success in conducting the nefarious
                  traffic in which he had been for some years engaged, and that the Albatross would
                  be considered a glorious prize.</p>
               <p>Once more the pinnace was manned, and Captain Seymour set sail for the secluded
                  abode of his lovely and youthful bride. Two days afterwards he sighted the bluff
                  point which concealed the little inlet oil Which was situated Zuleika's, cottage.
                  To his surprise and annoyance, a small schooner, such as the Portuguese employ in
                  the gold dust and ivory trade, was lying at anchor off the little harbor. A
                  glance, however, told Him that the vessel was no man-of-war, and he boldly sailed,
                  in, passing close under the counter of the schooner which he hailed in Portuguese,
                  asking her name and whence she came.</p>
               <p>"The Dom Pablo, from Lisbon," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"And whither are you bound?"</p>
               <p>"To the Coast for ivory and gold dust."</p>
               <p>"Then what the d——l do you do here?" was Seymour's muttered reply; but he hailed
                  the vessel again—</p>
               <p>"Is the Senor Capitano on board?"</p>
               <p>"No, senhor; he is ashore at the cottage yonder."</p>
               <p>"D——tion!" muttered Seymour, as he hauled aft the sheet of the pinnace's mainsail
                  and placed her head in the direction of the landing-place.</p>
               <p>"What boat is that?" was asked from on board the schooner.</p>
               <p>"We came from the Brazilian brig Esperanza, which is lying at anchor on the other
                  side of the island."</p>
               <p>"Whither are you bound?"</p>
               <p>"To the Coast, as you are. We have come here to endeavor to procure dye woods for
                  ballast," and thus endeavoring to deceive the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >contremaistre</foreign> of the schooner, Seymour sailed towards the creek, and
                  in a few minutes stepped on shore.</p>
               <p>He had noticed that the white flag was not flying from the flagstaff on the
                  hill—and so far he was satisfied. He did not wish that Zuleika should as yet be
                  aware that he was so near her. He was somewhat undecided how to act, but at length
                  he resolved to await on shore the return of the Portuguese captain from the visit
                  he presumed he was paying at the cottage. Two or three seamen belonging to the
                  schooner were rambling about on the beach, and having first cautioned his own crew
                  to maintain a strict incognito (he could trust the men, for the crew of the
                  pinnace were all picked hands), he entered into careless conversation with them,
                  and learnt that their captain had come from the Coast, where strange reports were
                  afloat respecting the extreme beauty of the White Lady, or the Recluse of Annabon,
                  as Zuleika was called, and being a young man—trading in his own vessel—his
                  curiosity had been awakened, and he had resolved to visit the island and ascertain
                  if the reports were true.</p>
               <p>"And <foreign xml:lang="FRA">diabole!</foreign>" continued his informant, "our
                  young captain finds enough to amuse himself with here. He has been here a week
                  already, and seems in no Hurry to sail. <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Chanzas
                     aparte,</foreign>" (joking apart) added the sailor, speaking the Spanish, for
                  Seymour spoke Portuguese but indifferently. "I fancy he is in love with the
                  lady."</p>
               <p>Seymour bit his lips to conceal his rising choler. He felt<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000110"/> inclined to strike the unsuspecting seaman to the
                  earth; but he restrained himself with a violet effort and asked; 'And you <foreign
                     xml:lang="POR">Amego mio</foreign>—have you seen the lady?"</p>
               <p>"No, Diabolo! our captain keeps to the sight of the treasure to himself—<foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">Entiende, senor.</foreign> I am half inclined to think he means
                  ton run off with the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">senora;</foreign> but here he comes.
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">A lospies es V., senor Capitano,</foreign> I must go
                  down to the boat."</p>
               <p>Seymour advanced to meet the captain of the schooner, who was a handsome young
                  Portuguese. He extended his hand to seymour—and addressed him in Portuguese,
                  taking him at once to be the captain, probably, of some trader like that which he
                  himself commanded. Noticing from the accent of Seymour that he understood
                  Portuguese but indifferently, he then continued the conversation in Spanish,
                  asking him whence he came and what had led him to pay a visit to the island.</p>
               <p>seymour replied as he had done to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >contremaistre,</foreign> and the young Portuguese told him frankly that he had
                  come to the wrong side of the island for dye-woods.</p>
               <p>"confess," said he, laughingly, "it is to see the fair recluse of this island you
                  have come."</p>
               <p>"And if I have."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Caramba!</foreign> If you have? Do not look so savage,
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor.</foreign> If you have you will see, by-and-bye,
                  a fairy that would set the hearts of half the <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >caballeros</foreign> in Madrid, or Lisbon either, in a flame."</p>
               <p>Seymour still managed to control the rising choler which was well nigh
                  overpowering him. He felt the mingled sensations of jealousy, doubt, fear, and the
                  desire of vengeance, rising in his breast and almost stifling him; but he wished
                  to be satisfied of the faith of Zuleika, and to ascertain whether the careless
                  words uttered by the sailor had any foundation in truth.</p>
               <p>"Come." Said the young Portuguese, "it is growing late, <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >Senor.</foreign> let us pay a visit together to the fair <foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">senora</foreign> to-morrow—and to-day you will come on board and
                  din with me. Come, I will take no denial. I want some one to bear me company—and I
                  will describe to you this island enchantress."</p>
               <p>"One would think," said Seymour, forcing himself to speak in a jocular tone, in
                  spite of the rage that was smouldering in his bosom, "one would think you were in
                  high favour with this <foreign xml:lang="SPA">senora,</foreign> whoever she
                  be."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Caramba!</foreign> no," said the young man, gaily. "The
                  lady is an icicle. Lovely as one of Canova's, or Raphael's ideals, and as cold and
                  passionless. I have visited her every day for a week, and have wasted my time for
                  naught. She is civil—nothing more; but the Portuguese have a proverb, an icicle
                  may be thawed with the warmth of a rushlight.' There is nothing like perseverence
                  in these matters. But you will come on board and dine, and to-morrow we will visit
                  together this Penelope, who is so faithful to her absent Ulysses. You have read
                  Telemaque, Capitano. <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Diabolo!</foreign> I wish T were the
                  happy man. But I have a plan in my head, which I will relate to you after
                  dinner."</p>
               <p>Seymour breathed free again. How could he for a moment have doubted the purity and
                  faith of Zuleika. "Yes," he thought, "I will go on board and dine with this gay
                  young <foreign xml:lang="SPA">caballero</foreign>—and hear his plan, as he calls
                  it. I, too, have a plan in my head, he little wots of."</p>
               <p>He accepted Captain De Silva's invitation (De Silva was the name of the young
                  Portuguese), and went on board the schooner with him—again cautioning his own crew
                  to maintain perfect secrecy.</p>
               <p>As he left the shore with his newly found companion, he cast a long, lingering
                  glance in the direction of Zuleika's abode. He could scarcely restrain his
                  impatience at this delay; "but," he thought, "it is better thus: I shall see you
                  to-morrow, Zuleika—and alone. And after that—"</p>

               <p>SHE was a long, low schooner, the Dom Pablo, beautifully moulded, with lofty,
                  graceful, raking masts, leaning so far back, indeed, that a plumb line dropped
                  from the main-top-mast head, would have cleared the taffrail. She was painted
                  black—black all over—hull and masts all of the same sombre color, except that the
                  former was relieved by a narrow ribbon-like gilded streak, and as she moved
                  gracefully upon the gently heaving billows of the bay, the brilliant gleam of her
                  copper bottom—for she was coppered quite up to the water-line—glittered in the
                  rays of the sun and reflected in the clear water. She might readily<pb n="210-211"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000111"/> have been taken for a pirate craft—the dom
                  Pablo—for she was just one of those honest merchantmen like to give a wide berth
                  to, when they happen to descry them hanging close under the land, or bearing down
                  suspiciously towards them just towards nightfall, and she carried six brightly
                  polished, four pound brass carronades, which shone like burnished gold—and one of
                  those large, long guns, amid-ships, turning upon a swivel, familiarly called, in
                  sea parlance, a long tom; she sailed like a witch. If her captain wanted to speak
                  a flash of lightning—and many a peaceful passenger wished himself on shore, or any
                  where else but he was, as he run to and fro, by the captain's advice, trying the
                  often resorted to, but childish game, of making the suspicious looking stranger
                  was multiplied into half a dozen men, as his head bobbed up and down in half dozen
                  different places—a scheme which only serves to amuse the knowing ones—and many an
                  old rusty gun had been bowsed out of the hold when the Dom Pablo hove in sight,
                  and clumsily placed on its decrepit and worm eaten stand, which it was a mercy was
                  not fired, for ten to one, but it would have brought it up from its damp
                  resting-place for their protection; but there was really no harm in the Dom Pablo,
                  nor in her captain, Dom Sebastian de Silva. The latter was as gallant and gay a
                  young caballero as ever flaunted in the streets of Lisbon, or trod the deck of a
                  vessel. A hand-some, good humored fellow, conscious of his good looks and proud of
                  them; a little given to foppery and dandyism, as might be seen by his wearing, as
                  nearly as he dared do, the uniform of an officer in the Portuguese navy; but this
                  was excusable, since he was no poltroon, with all his foppery, and he had plenty
                  of means to support it. He was the son of a wealthy merchant in Lisbon, who traded
                  largely with the natives of the African coast for gold dust and ivory, and the
                  young Sebastian being of an adventurous turn, and found of the excitement of sea
                  life, had made several voyages in his father's vessels, and at length, on the day
                  he had attained his majority, had received a present of the beautiful craft he now
                  commanded.</p>
               <p>The heavy armament, that, for so small a vessel, the Dom Pablo carried, was partly
                  for partly for the purpose of protection against the sometimes treacherous attacks
                  of the natives on the coast, and partly to serve the purpose of frightening, and
                  of fighting too, if need were, any similar craft, the employment of whose crew was
                  less honorable. Besides Captain De Silva chose to have everything handsome and
                  warlike about his bonny little vessel, and he took as much pride in her personal
                  appearance, as he could possibly have done in that of his wife or his mistress,
                  had he possessed either. But Captain De Silva's heart had never hitherto been
                  severely wounded by the arrows of Cupid, though several times stray darts had
                  glanced upon it and pierced it slightly, shot from the black eyes of the
                  Portuguese <foreign xml:lang="POR">senhoritas;</foreign> but a short voyage had
                  been sufficient to heal these slight abrasions, and before the captain had been
                  three weeks upon blue water, his heart had, hitherto, become as sound as ever. The
                  Dom Pablo was sufficiently profitable to afford abundant means to meet the
                  expenses of Dom Sebastian, although the old merchant, his father, would certainly
                  not have found her so creditably mentioned in figures upon his ledger, as any of
                  the other less elegant vessels in his service; for Senhor Sebastian sometimes took
                  a whim into his head to make flying visits to various places, to see which his
                  curiosity had been excited, altogher heedless of the real object of his voyage—and
                  it was on one of these visits that he and his ship were fallen in with by Captain
                  Seymour.</p>
               <p>Senhor De Silva had been boarded by the Alacrity—Captain Hall's ship—the British
                  craft fancying her to be what, as we have observed, many other persons feared her
                  to be a piratical craft—and he had not only found out his mistake, but he had
                  found the Senhor to be such a capital, jovial fellow, and his vessel so well
                  provided with luxuries not easily attainable on board cruisers that have been a
                  long time on a station, that he had spent some time on board the Dom Pablo, and
                  had dined with the captain, and learning his position from him in the course of
                  conversation (for among other accomplishments Senhor Sebastian spoke tolerably
                  good English), he had related to him his adventure on the island of Annabon, and
                  laughingly advised him to pay a visit to its lonely and mysterious inhabitant.</p>
               <p>Captain De Silva did not need pressing—it was just the sort of adventure to seize
                  hold of his imagination, and although be was at the time close to the port whither
                  he was bound, and sailing before the wind towards it, he braced his yards sharp up
                  directly and beat back again to the island. As he had informed<pb n="212-213"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000112"/> Captain Seymour, he had been there a week, and had
                  every day, for several hours in the day, paid his court to the fair recluse. To
                  tell the truth, the inconstant affections of Senhor Sebastian had been fixed, from
                  the first moment he had gazed upon the lovely countenance and the fairy,
                  sylph-like figure of Zuleika; and though he had, in the first instance, intended
                  to make but a passing visit, he had found himself bound to the spot by some
                  resistless fascination. Consequently his crew had been keeping holiday, roaming
                  about amongst the romantic woods and glades that abounded on the island, or
                  bathing in the cool shady inlets, or making up parties and going on fishing or
                  shooting excursions. In fact, enjoying a season of recreation, such as seldom
                  falls to the lot of poor Jack; while their captain, dressed to the very best
                  advantage, was assiduously prosecuting his suit toward the enchantress, who had
                  innocently and unsuspectingly entrapped him. Of course this was very pleasant and
                  agreeable to the crew, but very tantalizing and not very profitable to the
                  captain.</p>
               <p>He had never yet been able to discover who his inamorata was, or how she came to
                  be on the island, or whence she had come, or in fact anything about her; and the
                  more he was tantalized in this fashion, still the more was he fascinated with his
                  mysterious charmer. He! had tried to bribe the negroes—he had tried to cajole the
                  youth who bore her company (Jane Miller), but he had failed in learning anything.
                  Zuleika, simple unsuspecting, unsophisticated child, as she was, might have been
                  beguiled into making some satisfactory explanation; but she had been well schooled
                  by Jane, and the negroes had been warned, on pain of their mistress's and Captain
                  Seymour's displeasure, to maintain inviolable secrecy, and they had not 'betrayed
                  their trust. At the expiration of a whole week Captain De Silva was as wise as
                  ever and no wiser. He saw that Zuleika wore a plain gold ring on the third finger
                  of her hand, (warning symbol!) but he disregarded it. He could not learn who the
                  husband was that the ring typified, and he persuaded himself that it was merely
                  worn by the innocent girl as a pretty ornament.</p>
               <p>Thus stood matters when Captain Seymour arrived to interrupt the gallant Senhor's
                  wooing; but we will let him further explain his story in his own words.</p>
               <p>Seymour stepped into the boat and went on board the Dom Pablo, with De Silva. He
                  was startled when he set his feet upon the decks. He thought the Albatross a model
                  of a vessel sel—so undoubtedly she was; but the Dom Pablo was like a fairy craft;
                  so bright, so clean, so neatly was everything arranged; and her deck! why, the
                  most fastidious exquisite might have sat down and eaten his meals from off of that
                  deck, it was so white, so pure from soil or stain, and in the cabin everything was
                  arranged with a degree of refined taste that equally threw the Albatross into the
                  shade. The dinner, too, was a capital one, (Captain De Silva had not forgotten to
                  bring a good cook with him,) and the wines were excellent—they must have been some
                  of the choice wines from the elder De Silva's cellar in Lisbon—so ripe, so rich,
                  so exquisite in flavor they were. The cabin was furnished with sofas, and pistols
                  and fowling pieces were suspended from the sides in a variety of designs, and
                  glittering like silver and gold in their bright polish. These were singular
                  ornaments, but Seymour could but acknowledge in reply to the question of De Silva,
                  that they were really appropriate. Little was said during dinner; but when the
                  steward had removed the cloth and placed a fresh supply of wine upon the table,
                  and a variety of fruits and delicious preserves fresh from Portugal, and De Silva
                  had produced a box of superb Manillas, the conversation turned naturally enough
                  upon the lady of the isle.</p>
               <p>De Silva related the manner in which he had become aware of the existence of this
                  mysterious, fairy like inhabitant of Annabon.</p>
               <p>"I resolved," said he, "as soon as I heard the story from the lips of the
                  Englishman, to pay a visit to the island. <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >Caramba!</foreign> I lost no time—I don't know what my father will say—but my
                  cargo is waiting for me at Lahoa. I have just returned from Ibou, where I have
                  been laying in my ballast in logwood, and they will wonder what has become of me.
                  San Petro! it took me a fortnight to beat back again to this enchanted island, and
                  here have I been a week. I suspect my cargo is disposed of to some one else; but
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">esta nada,</foreign> I am satisfied to lose a little
                  money, if I can attain my aim with regard to this island damsel."</p>
               <p>Seymour felt his blood rush with fearful rapidity through his veins as he
                  listened; but he controlled his rising passion.</p>
               <p>"You said, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">senor,</foreign>
                  <ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                  (using the Spanish term of respect, for<note place="foot" xml:id="note_001">
                     
                     <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>The reader will perceive that we have used both the Spanish and Portuguese
                        methods of spelling the title of personal respect (in Spanish <foreign

                        been necessary. That is to say, we have used senhor when speaking of Dom
                        Sebastian in the first person—but he used <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                           >senor</foreign> when in conversation with Seymour, as they spoke in
                        Spanish. The titles <foreign xml:lang="POR">Dom</foreign> and <foreign
                           xml:lang="SPA">Don</foreign> on apply similarly—both have a similar

                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000113"/> the conversation was, as we have mentioned before,
                  carried on in Spanish) "that you had some plan in view with regard to this lady
                  whom I have yet to be introduced to? I shall be glad to hew it. You said you had
                  not yet met with much favor from the lady?"</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Caramba!</foreign> nor have I. As I told you, before,
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor,</foreign> the damsel is as cold as an icicle;
                  but listen—I know not whom she is, but I suspect she has been stolen, and brought
                  hither by some of the rascally piratical slaver captains who frequent this coast.
                  She is ignorant, poor thing, of the sad future that awaits her in such a case. It
                  is shocking to contemplate—so young, so beautiful! Now, I intend, since I cannot
                  entice her to come pn board the Dom Pablo—I believe it is all through that strange
                  youth she has placed on the island to serve as her Ganymede—to carry her off, and
                  take her back with me to Lisbon, and there to marry her. My plan is all arranged.
                  No blood will be spilt—no more force used than is necessary. The youth she has
                  with her I shall secure, as well as the negroes. I intend to leave them on the
                  island unharmed. I don't want to be troubled with the boy. He might, by and by,
                  tell unpleasant stories. My men are aware of my plan, and all is arranged to take
                  place to-morrow night. To-morrow, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor
                     Caballero,</foreign> we will go together and see the lady. You will confess
                  that my heart, which has withstood the artillery of so many pairs of black eyes in
                  Lisbon, has not succumbed at last to an unworthy object. Santa Maria! she is
                  fairer than Venus herself."</p>
               <p>"But," said Seymour, amused, in spite of his vexation, at the enthusiasm of the
                  young Portuguese, "perhaps the lady would not be willing to marry you—perhaps she
                  is already wedded."</p>
               <p>"No, no; I will not believe that last supposition; and as to her not being willing
                  to marry me—<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Caramba!</foreign> I will love her so much—I
                  will worship her so earnestly—that, by and by, <emph>she will love me.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"But your parents," said Seymour; "how will they fancy your marriage with an
                  unknown damsel—the daughter and sister, perhaps, if, indeed, not the wife of some
                  desperate outlaw?"</p>
               <p>"My parents," said the young man, placing his hand affectedly upon his bosom,
                  "have nothing to say in such an affair as this; '<foreign xml:lang="FRA">les
                     affections de la cœur,</foreign>' as they say in France, are not to be
                  controlled, or even regulated, by parental authority."</p>
               <p>"Well, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor,</foreign> I see your wound is incurable; but
                  recollect I have not yet seen the damsel. Suppose I, too, should fall in love, and
                  become your rival. How would you manage then?"</p>
               <p>"I conceive the lady is mine by prior right of possession. Acknowledge, <foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">Senor,</foreign> it would be ungallant in you to offer to take
                  such an advantage; but there is little fear of that, I trust."</p>
               <p>"And you say this little affair is to come off to-morrow night? Suppose, in the
                  mean time, her father, or brother, or lover, or, as I said before, perchance her
                  husband should happen to come into the harbor, and overthrow your plans."</p>
               <p>"Then I must succumb for the present; but I would follow her to the world's end,
                  but I would learn who she is. <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor,</foreign> I am
                  somewhat inclined to be Quixotic in my views—I am a great admirer of that glorious
                  romance of yours (De Silva was under the impression that Seymour was a
                  Spaniard)."</p>
               <p>"I think this plan of yours Quixotic indeed," replied Seymour, sarcastically, for
                  he could no longer entirely control himself. "I think it wrong, and I would oppose
                  it myself. Listen, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor Don</foreign> Sebastian. Would it
                  not be better that you should forget this foolish caprice—this absurd endeavor to
                  obtain the love of a strange damsel, whom you have only seen for the first time, a
                  week since, and to proceed on your voyage?"</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Diabolo!</foreign> no, Senor," haughtily replied the
                  young Portuguese. "Senor, you have eaten bread and drank wine with me, at my
                  table. I do not wish to quarrel with you, but, mark me, I am resolved to act as I
                  have said; you can aid me or not, as you please; but, if you oppose me, I am your
                  enemy to the death." Senor Sebastian, in his excitement, while conversing as
                  above, and relating his plans to Seymour, had indulged in the wine cup more freely
                  than was usual with him, and Seymour, who had been more guarded, and who, since he
                  found his advice of no avail, had resolved to put his own desperate plan into
                  execution—saw that further argument was useless. He determined to temporize with
                  his guest, and he merely replied:</p>
               <p>"As you please, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor.</foreign> I shall not oppose your
                  plan to-morrow. I only gave such advice as I thought best—but we will see this
                  lady together. Now, as it is growing late, I must go ashore."</p>
               <p>"Nay, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor,</foreign>" replied the young Portuguese
                  captain, whose<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7191-00000114"/> ill humor was appeased
                  as quickly as it had risen; "I was a fool to get angry; you must sleep on board
                  to-night. I have a spare state room."</p>
               <p>"I seldom sleep in the cabin in these warm climates; but I will accept your offer,
                  and wrap my cloak around me under the awning on the quarter-deck; but I must first
                  go ashore and tell my men, or they will be expecting me."</p>
               <p>"As you will, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor,</foreign>" said Sebastian. "I am
                  sleepy; I think I have drank too much wine; I shall turn in and sleep. Bring your
                  men on board with you, captain. To-morrow we will breakfast together, and I will
                  take you with me to the lady's bower; but be discreet, captain—be discreet;" and
                  he rose up, and walking with a somewhat unsteady step to his berth, he threw
                  himself, dressed as he was, on the bed, murmuring, as he closed his eyes:</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor</foreign>—to-morrow—be patient until
                  to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"<emph>To-morrow!</emph>" muttered Seymour, between his teeth, as he ascended the
                  ladder to the deck. "Yes, <emph>to-night!</emph>"</p>
               <p>He jumped into the schooner's boat, and two of the crew pulled him ashore—his own
                  crew were waiting for him on the beach. They had, however, begun to give him up,
                  and were advising amongst themselves whether they should wait longer, or endeavor
                  to find shelter from the dew in some of the negro huts that skirted the beach.</p>
               <p>"I have need of you, men," said he, as, after having sprung ashore, he had told
                  the schooner's men to pull aboard again—sending a message to the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">contremaistre</foreign> of the schooner, to the effect that he
                  would be on board in his own boat, as he had promised the captain, in the course
                  of half an hour. "I have need of you, men, to-night. You must come on board that
                  schooner with me, and this night she must be ours. Some of you have been engaged
                  in deeds of piracy; but I, since I have commanded a vessel myself, have always
                  held aloof from robbery or bloodshed, even when most strongly tempted. It has not
                  been upon principle that I have done this. No; I have suffered and witnessed
                  enough to satisfy me that all men prey upon each other; and the fear of incurring
                  the penalties of the law only prevents even social communities from degenerating
                  into the practise of outrage upon life and property. As it is, society is a system
                  of hypocrisy—every man hating, fearing, or envying his neighbor. I have,
                  therefore, no compunction in raising my hand against my fellows: it is merely
                  instinct, natural softness of disposition, perhaps, that makes me shrink from and
                  shudder at the sight of blood, except it be spilt while my own blood is heated by
                  excitement; but this night that schooner must be ours; when the morning breaks,
                  she must be sunk fathoms deep in the ocean, and none of her crew must survive to
                  tell the tale. It is unnecessary for me to tell you why I have resolved upon
                  this—for I know that you will obey me without question—enough for me to say, that,
                  as you are aware, I have repeatedly visited this island, on business concerning
                  myself alone, the nature of which some of you—nay, most, if not all of you—are
                  aware of. The captain of yonder schooner has discovered my secret my secret, and
                  although I might foil him in his designs, I could; not trust to the silence either
                  of himself or his crew. It is a stern decree—a fate I would willingly spare
                  them—but they must die. The crew consists of sixteen men, including the captain.
                  There are nine of us, armed and ready to act—while they aye unprepared and
                  unsuspecting of treachery. Of course, they can be easily overpowered, as they
                  awaken from their sleep. Go to rest when on board, so as to excite no suspicion. I
                  will give you the signal when to commence. The vessel contains property of
                  considerable value. Such of it as can be readily saved shall belong wholly to you.
                  I do not intend to share in the spoil. Conceal your arms; be cautious, yet ready
                  to act on the instant, and you will succeed without difficulty. Now, men, are you
                  ready to follow me?"</p>
               <p>"All—all ready," shouted the men.</p>
               <p>"Then man the boat, and let us go on board."</p>
               <p>In the course of a few minutes Seymour and his pinnace's crew stood upon the deck
                  of the Dom Pablo.</p>
               <p>"Is the captain asleep?" asked Seymour of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >contremaistre,</foreign> who was standing at the gangway, half asleep, waiting
                  to receive the visitors.</p>
               <p>"Si, Senor, and I have been ashore all day. I am tired. I am glad you have come,
                  that I, too, may sleep."</p>
               <p>"Do you keep no watch?" asked Seymour.</p>
               <p>"No, Senor, not in this harbor. <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Caramba!</foreign> there
                  is no danger—the anchorage is good, the water is smooth, and we do not fear any
                  attacks from the natives of this island."</p>
               <p>Seymour glanced satisfactorily at his men.</p>
               <p>"I thought you kept watch," said lid; "Who are those two men walking the deck,
                  forward there?"</p>
               <p>"They are the nominal watch, Senor, but here we allow<pb n="218-219"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000115"/> them to sleep. The boat coming alongside has roused
                  them for a moment—they will soon sleep again."</p>
               <p>"I told Don Sebastian that I should repose in the cot under the awning; but I
                  think I will go below to the berth the captain offered me," said Seymour.</p>
               <p>"As you please Senor. For my part, I shall stretch myself on deck. Diabolo! the
                  cabin is too warm for me."</p>
               <p>"And'my men?" said Seymour, inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"Can pick out the softest plank until daylight, and then we will give them a good
                  breakfast. We feed well on board the Dom Pablo, Senor."</p>
               <p>Seymour carelessly told his men to lie down where they could find the best place,
                  while he himself descended to the cabin.</p>
               <p>In the course of half an hour he returned to the deck. The crew of the schooner
                  were all soundly sleeping—like their captain, they had indulged, most of them, too
                  freely. Poor fellows, they were making the most of their holiday—but little
                  fancying, as their minds wandered in their slumbers to the sunny banks of the
                  Douro and the Tagus, where they had left their wives, and sweethearts, and
                  families, and friends—little dreaming of the fate that was hanging over their
                  heads.</p>
               <p>Seymour's crew heard his light footstep, as he reached the deck. They looked
                  inquiringly towards him, as he drew near the spot where they were half sitting,
                  half lying, in a cluster.</p>
               <p>"Is it time, Captain?" asked one, in a whisper.</p>
               <p>"Not yet—not yet," replied Seymour, in a like low tone. "Who is there on deck?" he
                  asked, glancing around him.</p>
               <p>"Only two sailors, and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">contremaistre.</foreign> They
                  are sleeping soundly."</p>
               <p>"They must not awake. You will be able to secure their arms and legs with some of
                  the rattling line I see there, without disturbing their slumbers. This done, you
                  must do the same good office to the sleepers below. The captain is already
                  secure—I do not fear his waking; but, at alt events, he is fast, hand and foot.
                  Mind men, if it be possible to avoid it, there must be no bloodshed. When all the
                  crew are secured, we will scuttle the ship, whilst they are sleeping, and then
                  there will be time to remove your spoil—the valuables from the cabin—the men's
                  chests from the forecastle, too, if you choose. Now, to work, and noiselessly—all
                  depends upon speed and quietness."</p>
               <p>So soundly were all the devoted crew of the ill-fated Dom Pablo sleeping, that not
                  one of them was aroused while the stout cordage was being wound around them in
                  such a manner that none of them could rise to their feet when awakened; and, this
                  done, two of the men were directed to pierce augur holes in the sides, below the
                  water-mark.</p>
               <p>It was done: the unconscious victims were bound down in their floating home, so
                  soon to, be their coffin; and meanwhile, the valuables from the coffin, and,
                  indeed, every movable article the pinnace could carry, was placed on board of her,
                  and the pirates—for such Seymour and his crew now undoubtedly were—entered the
                  boat themselves, so as to get beyond the effects of the suction, when the schooner
                  should go down. They were none too soon in the boat—the little vessel was sinking
                  rapidly, and the noise of the water rushing in had apparently waked up one or more
                  of the sleepers; for, as the boat was being pulled rapidly beyond the reach of the
                  impending danger, the crew heard a voice shouting aloud, in tones of alarm and
                  terror.</p>
               <p>"Pull away—pull men—out of hearing of that voice!" shouted Seymour, and he pressed
                  both hands on his ears, as though seeking to shut out the sound, and the men,
                  animated by the same impulse—for the tones of that voice, so full of anguish,
                  struck to the hearts of the most hardened amongst them—did pull with all their
                  might, until the perspiration rolled like rain drops down their cheeks, and their
                  light clothing was as thoroughly saturated as if they had dipped it overboard into
                  the water. And then they stopped, as with one accord, and looked back with
                  straining eyes. The Dom Pablo was still afloat, and her tall, graceful masts,
                  could still be traced in the clear atmosphere of that starlit night; but the black
                  line of the hull was now a mere streak on the surface of the water; and now the
                  masts sway heavily to and fro, and the vessel gives a sudden jerk forward, and the
                  eyes of, the pinnace's crew are fixed upon her with a serpent-like fascination,
                  while the warm perspiration has turned to a cold clammy sweat upon, their faces—a
                  mortal terror seems for the moment to have possessed them, and a convulsive
                  shudder passes through their frames, which causes the pinnace itself, deeply laden
                  as it is, to tremble; for now the vessel jerks forward still more violently, and
                  again the bow recedes from the water, as if the beautiful craft were struggling to
                  avert its doom; but in vain; the last plunge is made, and the Dom Pablo, so lately
                  riding in queenly grace and beauty on the<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7191-00000116"
                  /> gently flowing billows of the bay, has sunk to the bottom, and sixteen souls,
                  in all the pride of health and strength, hare passed into eternity.</p>
               <p>"Pull to the shore," said Seymour, in a stern tone; and then he muttered,
                     "<emph>To-morrow!</emph> did he not say <emph>to-morrow?</emph> Well, where
                  will he meet his morrow? and by and by, where will be mine? Psha! the fool—he
                  brought it all on his own head. It was not <emph>My fault.</emph> Pull away, men,"
                  he shouted, louder and more sternly than before. "Pall away—let us quit this
                  cursed spot."</p>
               <p>And the men did pull with all their might, still keeping their gaze fixed upon the
                  spot where the Dom Pablo had disappeared, as though they expected and dreaded to
                  see the ghosts of the drowned victims arise from beneath the dark water. All those
                  men had been guilty many a time Of lawless deeds—some had already imbrued their
                  hands in human blood—but there were some amongst them who felt that on that night
                  the burning mark of Cain had been for the first time stamped upon their brows,
                  never more to be effaced.</p>
               <p>It wanted yet some hours of dawn, and when they had reached the shore they tried
                  to sleep; but little slumber visited their eyelids that night. But one cry had
                  been heard, yet fancy echoed and re-echoed that cry of agony, and the mingled
                  voices of the drowning victims seemed to be howling around the murderers in the
                  midst of the gloom.</p>
               <p>Seymour sat apart, his face buried in his hands. What were the thoughts of the
                  wretched man, during the residue of that night of horror?</p>
               <p>At length day dawned. Never before had day appeared to dawn so slowly to those
                  guilty men; but the bright, warm sun rose at last, diffusing gladness around, and
                  the gloom passed from them, and some Of the more hardened even affected to jest
                  upon the occurrences of the night; but Seymour—the most guilty of all, the
                  promoter of the dreadful deed—sternly rebuked them, and, bidding them remain by
                  the pinnace, bent his steps towards the residence of Zuleika.</p>
               <p>The bright beams of the rising sun had no sooner flashed on the casement of the
                  bed-room where Zuleika slept than she sprang from her couch, and after performing
                  her morning ablutions, and hastily dressing herself, she sought the couch of Jane
                  Miller.</p>
               <p>"Wake up," she said, "see what a lovely morning; let us walk out before the hour
                  arrives on which that strange man will repeat his tiresome visits. Oh! I wish
                  Seymour would come. Surely, now that I have been so much annoyed, he will remove
                  me hence—to—to his own country."</p>
               <p>Jane Miller arose from the bed on which she had been reposing, and was soon ready
                  to join Zuleika in her accustomed morning ramble. Their first destination was to
                  the summit of the eminence where stood the flag-staff, which summit commanded an
                  extended view of the ocean.</p>
               <p>Zuleika arrived first at the flag-staff, and her gaze was naturally directed
                  towards the spot where the schooner had been at anchor for the past week.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible," she said, as Jane approached her, "or do my eyes deceive me.
                  See, Jane! the Portuguese schooner has sailed during the night, and yet the
                  captain said he should come here again, to-day. Oh, I am so glad! Now, if I could
                  only see my husband's ship, I should be quite happy. He has been long away. Surely
                  he must come soon now."</p>
               <p>"The schooner seems, indeed, to have sailed," said Jane Miller, as she gazed
                  towards the anchorage, "The captain has taken his departure suddenly; but I am
                  glad of it. I should dread to see strangers here when Seymour comes."</p>
               <p>"Let us go down to the landing-place," said Zuleika. "It is a long time since we
                  have walked there; I have been too frightened to go there since those strangers
                  have been here," and without waiting for Jane's reply, she bounded away down the
                  hill, with the grace and speed of a fawn, followed almost as rapidly by her more
                  staid companion. They soon reach the path which led to the landing-place, through
                  the wood, but in another moment stopped suddenly and panic stricken—</p>
               <p>"The vessel has sailed and left some of the crew on the island. Oh! what can be
                  the meaning of this?" asked Zuleika.</p>
               <p>"Let us return to the cottage," replied Jane. "See, some one is approaching
                  towards us."</p>
               <p>Zuleika gazed in the direction pointed out by Jane, and to the astonishment of her
                  companion, immediately uttered a cry of delight and ran forward to meet the
                  stranger.</p>
               <p>"It is George—dear George," she said. "Be has come at last," and before Jane could
                  recover from her surprise, Zuleika was in her husband's embrace.</p>
               <p>For the time being the guilty man forgot the horrors of the past night, which he
                  had been brooding over as he walked along.</p>
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7191-00000117"/>
               <p>"My own Zuleika," he said, "this meeting repays me for all my anxiety. I have been
                  very anxious about you, love."</p>
               <p>"and I have much to tell you, when I have time; but not now—oh, not now—I am too
                  happy; but George, you have come at last to take me away from this place; have you
                  not?"</p>
               <p>"Why, dearest?"</p>
               <p>"Because, I am unhappy here. So many strangers come here now—and, perhaps I am
                  foolish—but I am afraid to live here alone any longer."</p>
               <p>"It is as I thought," muttered Seymour to himself. "What I have heard has been the
                  truth." Then he added aloud. "I have come to take you home, Zuleika,—to-day. Can
                  you get ready to go with me to-day?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—in an hour," exclaimed the delighted girl; "but George, where is your
                  ship?"</p>
               <p>"I have come in the pinnace, as usual, darling," said Seymour. "You will not be
                  afraid to go in her with me to the place where my ship is at anchor?"</p>
               <p>"I will go anywhere—everywhere with you, George," said the young girl, looking up
                  smilingly and lovingly into her husband's face. "Are you going to take me to
                  America?"</p>
               <p>"I am going to take you to a new, and I hope a more happy and pleasant home,"
                  answered Seymour, evading the question.</p>
               <p>"To <emph>your</emph> home, George?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, love, to <emph>my</emph> home; at least to the place I hope soon to make my
                  home."</p>
               <p>Thus chatting together they walked on in the direction of the cottage. Jane Miller
                  had remained on the spot where she had stood when Zuleika first espied Seymour.
                  Until then, the latter had not noticed her, if he had, in his delight at meeting
                  Zuleika, he had disregarded her.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Harry," said he; "how have you been since I have been away. The air of
                  Annabon seems to agree with you, boy. You are blushing like a rose. How have Harry
                  and you agreed together, Zuleika?" addressing the latter.</p>
               <p>"Oh, famously," replied Zuleika. I should have been still more lonesome had it not
                  have been for his companionship. You will take her"—she stopped (Zuleika was
                  nearly forgetting herself; but Seymour had not noticed the slip of the tongue.)
                  "You will take him with us to our new home—to your home, won't you, dear
                  George?"</p>
               <p>"If lie chooses to accompany you, dear—but he is his own master in that
                  regard—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, then I am sure he'll go," interrupted Zuleika—then suddenly recollecting
                  herself, and checking her speech, as though some painful thought had crossed her
                  mind, she added—"But no, perhaps I am wrong; perhaps Harry had better leave us.
                     <emph>He</emph> has Mends he wishes to see at home—<emph>I</emph> have only
                  you, George," and throwing her arm around her husband's neck, she raised her
                  slight figure on tiptoe, and gently pulled his face towards her, again pressed her
                  lips to his.</p>
               <p>"A sudden change in your fancy, darling," said Seymour, returning the kiss with
                  interest. "Well, settle that matter between you. Let Harry make what choice he
                  pleases. But now let us go to the cottage, dear. We must be away to-night, and
                  there is much to be done."</p>
               <p>"And you shall see how quickly I can do it, George," replied Zuleika. "There is
                  only one regret—I shall dread to bid good-by forever to my poor faithful
                  negroes."</p>
               <p>"Better not say good-by at all, then," replied Seymour, who had his own object in
                  this arrangement.</p>
               <p>"I could never leave them without saying farewell," answered Zuleika; "I should
                  ever be sorry for it afterwards. They have been so kind always. It would be
                  ungrateful."</p>
               <p>"You would think of the parting twice as bitterly, believe me, Zuleika, if you
                  subjected yourself to the bitterness of saying good-by. But, never mind that now.
                  To the cottage and get things in readiness."</p>
               <p>It was a more sorrowful and a longer task than Zuleika had first thought, this
                  leaving a home—lonely enough, but still endeared to her by so many ties. There
                  were her pet kids and fawns to pat and caress for the last time. She had not
                  thought of this. There were all her pets amongst the negro children, too; she had
                  forgotten them. In her delight at Seymour's arrival; at the thought—poor
                  child!—engendered by her own bright hopes, that she was going to live with him at
                  his own home, and to be separated from him no more, she had forgotten, that
                  although she loved Seymour with an all-engrossing love, there were still numerous
                  other little ties attached to her heart which could not rudely be snapped asunder,
                  without causing that gentle heart to bleed. But the fiat had gone forth from the
                  lips of him she loved and worshipped with all the purity and depth of a true
                  woman's love, and she hastened to prepare for this momentous change in her mode
                     of<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7191-00000118"/> life. She and Jane, or rather
                  Harry, as she styled her again now, were busy all day—and in the hurry and bustle
                  much was forgotten that would otherwise have saddened her mind. By midnight, all
                  was ready for their departure. The negroes were asleep; they had no thought of her
                  departure, and Seymour would not have them awakened. We have said already, he had
                  his own object in view. The seamen were called up from the beach, and the luggage
                  removed to the pinnace; and then Zuleika, accompanied by Seymour and Jane Miller,
                  and the only personal attendant who resided in the cottage, also went on
                  board.</p>
               <p>"Wait here for me," said Seymour, after having seen her safe to the boat. "I have
                  forgotten something at the cottage, I will return as soon as possible. Get all
                  ready for starting," addressing the seamen.</p>
               <p>He was absent about three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>"Now, put off," said he, as he returned, and springing on board he seated himself
                  beside Zuleika under the awning in the stern sheets of the pinnace—which in a
                  short time was gliding swiftly over the waves, and fast leaving Zuleika's home,
                  for so many years, behind. They had just reached the point that would have shut
                  out the inlet and harbor from view, when a bright lurid flame seemed to burst
                  forth from the midst of the woods, in the direction of the cottage.</p>
               <p>"What is that I" said Zuleika, greatly alarmed.</p>
               <p>"It is your cottage burning, darling, I have fired it—don't be alarmed."</p>
               <p>"But the negroes—the poor, helpless negroes," said the girl.</p>
               <p>"They are safe, love. It is only the residence lately occupied by you that is on
                  fire. The negroes will be awakened when they see the flames, and will make their
                  escape."</p>
               <p>"Why have you burned my cottage—the dear old cottage where I have lived so long,
                  George?"</p>
               <p>"I have motives you can't understand, love. Some day, perhaps, you shall hear
                  them. Now for our new home."</p>
               <p>And the pinnace sped on, her pathway light across the waters by the reflection of
                  the flames which burned fiercely and brilliantly lighted up the entire
                  horizon.</p>
               <p>The scene was grand and picturesque; but the reflection of those lurid flames, and
                  the awful sublimity of the scene, struck horror to the hearts of the seamen.</p>
               <p>They recollected the horrible deed of the previous night, and the red flames
                  seemed, to their superstitious imaginations, to be the flames of Hell—bursting
                  forth and pursuing them, even across the waters, as though in haste to surround
                  and consume them for their misdeeds. But the boat sped quietly along, and the
                  night passed away and the morning dawned, and towards the close of the day the
                  pinnace arrived at the place where the Albatross lay—and Zuleika slept that night
                  in the cabin of her husband's ship.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Mordant displays his Charity in the midst of his Misfortunes—He meets with
                     a severe Domestic Affliction.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>"DEAR me, dear me, how very singular—how incomprehensible to me is this
                  determination of Seymour's," muttered Mr. Mordant to himself, as he was sitting in
                  his library in his house in —— Place, with a packet of letters before him—one of
                  which he had twice perused and still held in his hand; and the wealthy old
                  merchant laid the hand which held the letter on his knee, and with knit brows and
                  compressed lips, sat twirling his gold double eye-glass round his finger by the
                  black silk ribbon which held it, as was customary with him, when in what is termed
                  a brown study. "Perfectly incom-prehensible," he repeated, slowly emphasising the
                  syllables—" I can't understand it," and he raised his left hand which held the
                  letter, and again placing his eye-glass to his eye ran over sundry of the
                  paragraphs again.</p>
               <p>"'* * * * I have made arrangements for a supply of <emph>freight,</emph> as usual,
                  with the Loango chiefs,'—um—um—um. All very well, so far as that goes—'Tolcroft
                  will navigate the vessel to the Brazils. He is careful, and I have instructed him
                  how to act; besides furnishing him with letters of introduction to certain parties
                  you wot of, in Aracati and Bahia'—very well, all very well, if Tolcroft is able to
                  manage things properly. He is a good seaman enough, I know that; but, bless me,
                  such a blundering, uncouth dog—that I have my misgivings.</p>
               <p>"'I think' (again reading the letter), 'you should expect to hear of the arrival
                  of the Albatross at Aracati, or somewhere upon the coast, during the ensuing month
                  of August, if all goes on favorably.' Yes, if all goes on favorably; but it is too
                  bad of Seymour, to play me this trick. What can have possessed<pb n="226-227"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000119"/> the man? What mad freak has he taken into his head?
                  'I arrived at Sierra Leone, a week ago, and shall leave for St. Lewis on the
                  Senegal, to-morrow, in a French coasting craft, there I shall probably find a
                  vessel bound to the southern coast of France, and as imperative business calls me
                  to the Mediterranean, I shall embrace that, which I think the readiest opportunity
                  of reaching that sea. It is not necessary at present to explain my future plans;
                  but if all goes well, you will see me in New York by October next.'</p>
               <p>"Strange, very strange indeed! but what else does he say! Ah—</p>
               <p>"'* * * * * By-the-by—I hear sad tidings of the Dolphin. Junot, it appears got
                  away from the cruiser, which, you recollect, I informed you had captured her and
                  well nigh entrapped me; but he was caught in a <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >pampero</foreign> and his vessel was disabled—sheer carelessness on his part.
                  These <foreign xml:lang="SPA">pamperos</foreign> are quite harmless if a proper
                  look-out is kept and sail reduced in time—and she was taken the following day by a
                  British man-of-war, and, of course, made a prize of—having at the time she was
                  disabled upwards of two hundred slaves on board—whom Junot threw overboard when he
                  saw the man-of-war was going to board her. He might have got clear off—though at a
                  dreadful sacrifice of life and property—after all; but, it appears that he had
                     <emph>expended</emph> the prize crew who had been placed on board by the vessel
                  that first captured him, and from which he made his escape—cleverly enough—I give
                  him credit for that. But one of his crew, horrified at the scenes he had
                  witnessed—Junot was always d—d careless who he engaged, brute as he was—informed
                  the British officer of the murder. Of course the Dolphin was seized, and she and
                  her officers and crew were carried into St. Helena, where the latter were brought
                  to trial. The vessel was condemned and sold, and the captain and officers
                  sentenced to death. The two mates were hanged; but Junot shot himself in prison
                  the night preceding the day on which he was to have been executed. The crew were
                  sent adrift, and I suppose by this time are scattered about in various places.
                  Altogether it was a bad job; but it served Junot right. He was a coward and a
                  brute into the bargain; and, although we are all compelled to do dirty jobs
                  occasionally, he had a bungling way of doing things, which was repeatedly getting
                  him into trouble. It is such men as he that bring disgrace upon us, and I can't
                  say I am sorry for his fate—I hope the loss will not fall very heavily upon you.
                  By the way, I forgot to say that there were two negro babies found in the cabin of
                  the Dolphin—which have been sent to Sierra Leone—the only portion of the freight
                  found on board.</p>
               <p>"Pooh!" said the merchant as he concluded the extract. "What the D—1. I mean what
                  is it to me whether any negro babies were found or not. I shall lose a pretty
                  penny by the affair—although fortunately the loss will not fall altogether on me.
                  That, however, is not the worst of it. It may lead to inquiries which may not be
                  pleasant. Well, well; bad news never comes single. I am a good deal more annoyed
                  at Seymour's strange conduct than I am at the loss of the Dolphin. I had made up
                  my mind to that—" and Mr. Mordant folded up the letter; placed it in the bundle
                  and carefully locked it up in his desk. Then again seating himself in his
                  arm-chair, he gazed pensively into the evening twilight, while the contortion of
                  the muscles of his face, the knitting of his brows, and the nervous twitching of
                  the lines around his closely compressed lips, showed evidently that his mind was
                  ill at ease. There were other matters of weighty moment pressing upon him and
                  paralizing his energies and distracting his thoughts at that moment, besides the
                  singular and inexplicable behavior of Seymour, and the loss of the Dolphin. He
                  kept muttering almost inaudibly to himself. At length he spoke aloud, but still in
                  a low tone of voice:</p>
               <p>"I wish," he said, "I could get clear of that scoundrel Harvey. I don't half like
                  his manner of late. I am almost sorry I gave him that money; and yet I could not
                  avoid it, without giving up the property. I had better have done that, if I could
                  have been sure that he would have held his tongue afterwards; but he has me in his
                  power, and I can see intends to use that power to suit his own ends. I begin to
                  think Mrs. Miller has heard something about this business. Her manner was very
                  strange when she called at the office yesterday—"</p>
               <p>There was a knock at the door of the library.</p>
               <p>"Come in," said the merchant, and a servant entered with a letter on a silver
                  tray.</p>
               <p>"A letter for you, sir," said he. "The person who brought it is waiting"
                  below."</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant opened the letter, and a tailor's bill fell from the inside. He picked
                  it up without looking at it, and laying it on the table, commenced to read the
                  letter. It was as follows:—</p>

                              your influence to induce Mr. Charles to settle the enclosed account,
                              now current for two years. I have a large sum to make up by the 1st
                              inst., and if I am unable to raise the money, I shall be compelled to
                              go into the Bankrupt Court. I am sorry to say that this distress on my
                              part has been brought about by the impossibility of obtaining payment
                              of my accounts with several young gentlemen, who, like Mr. Charles
                              Mordant, have got deeply in my debt, and who, as is the case with him,
                              have not made any settlement for years. I make this appeal, confident
                              that you will see the necessity of settling the account, as the
                              disclosure that must necessarily be made, should my books come before

               <p>The reader is not to suppose that the worthy tradesman meant anything by the
                  inuendo that he had innocently blundered upon in the latter portion of his letter
                  to the merchant, It was merely a clumsily-constructed sentence, on reading which,
                  vexed as he was, the merchant could not forbear smiling, The smile, however, soon
                  gave place to a frown, as he took up the account and examined it.</p>
               <p>"Thirteen hundred and sixty-two dollars, seventy-five cents!" said he, in a tone
                  of amazement, "for two years' purchase of clothing at his tailor's; and Charles
                  has an allowance of three thousand a year I Good gracious! why the boy must be the
                  veriest spendthrift on earth—besides, not a month ago, he came to me and pleaded
                  to having overdrawn his allowance, and begged five hundred dollars, which, after a
                  severe lecture, I gave him to discharge this very tailor's bill. I must see Mr. ——
                  about this, and talk to Charles. It will never do, though, as things stand at
                  present, to allow the debt to be proven in Court. The man must be paid, I suppose.
                  "Thomas," addressing the servant, tell Mr. —— I will call at his store on my way
                  to town, to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said the man, and lie retired to deliver the message.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes he returned.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Douglass is waiting below, sir, and if you are disengaged, he would like to
                  see you."</p>
               <p>"Confounded bore!" muttered the merchant. "Tell him I am busy, Thomas, and ask him
                  if he will call again. Some demand for payment to some religious charity, I
                  suppose. No—stay, Thomas; ask Mr. Douglass to walk up stairs."</p>
               <p>"It is as well to settle these things promptly; they are necessary expenditures,
                  and turn to a profitable account," he added to himself, as the man quitted the
                  room, "I have spent thousands in this way; but I don't know that they haven't paid
                  good interest."</p>
               <p>Mr. Douglass was shown up stairs and entered the room, and was received with great
                  suavity by Mr. Mordant.</p>
               <p>"Take a seat, Mr. Douglass," said he; "I am glad to see you. A call, I presume,
                  for my subscription to some of those charities in which you interest yourself so
                  much?"</p>
               <p>"You have guessed right, sir," said Mr. Douglass. "And I am happy to say that you,
                  Mr. Mordant, are amongst those upon whom the directors of charitable societies can
                  always reckon. The money is not forced from you, but is offered freely and with
                  good will. Oh! Mr. Mordant, I wish more of our wealthy citizen were like you in

                  men and women whose charitable feelings are spontaneous, and who readily give of
                  their abundance to the relief of their less fortunate fellow-creatures. If there
                  is much evil in the world, Mr. Mordant, there is also much that is good. America,
                  and New York particularly, lack not individuals of truly charitable natures, to
                  whom to give is the greatest pleasure."</p>
               <p>Mr. Douglass, who was a philanthropist in the true sense of the world, a man who
                  devoted his energies to the cause of religion and religion's chief beauty,
                  "Heaven-born charity," spoke truly. There were, no doubt, many amongst those whom
                  he classed in his list of generous benefactors to the poor, who, like Mr. Mordant,
                  gave freely, not charity's nor religion's but for ostentation's sake; but there
                  were and are many also, to whom to<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7191-00000121"/> give
                  is the greatest pleasure and whose life is spent in seeking to do good. Many
                  amongst those, who, to the eye of the world, seem to be mere votaries of
                  pleasure—who "do good by stealth and blush to find it fame," especially amongst
                  the female sex, whose unwearied labors in the cause of charity in the city of New
                  York and other cities of the Union, constitute their greatest charm and their
                  highest glory. It has been our province to paint various characters in no
                  estimable light; but we do not necessarily, by so doing, assume that there is no
                  virtue amongst mankind—above all, amongst womankind. If there is much fashionable
                  dissipation and frivolity, there is also much self-denial and much expenditure of
                  labor in the cause of virtue. Long may such labors continue to shed a lustre
                  amongst us, and to gild the gloom of the Sodom-and-Gomorrah-like darkness which
                  would otherwise overwhelm us.</p>
               <p>But this is a digression. Let us return to the thread of our narrative.</p>
               <p>"What is the object of your present call?" inquired Mr. Mordant, endeavoring to
                  assume a pleasing smile and a benevolent expression of countenance.</p>
               <p>"Your yearly subscription to the Bible Society is due, Mr. Mordant. It is on that
                  account I have called particularly; but I wish also to bring under your notice the
                  state of distress to, which a poor, and I believe, an honest and worthy family
                  have been brought in consequence of the sudden death of their only support—the
                  father—a mechanic, who was lately killed by that sad steamboat explosion. He
                  leaves a sick wife and six small children quite destitute."</p>
               <p>"Put me down for $25," said Mr. Mordant.</p>
               <p>"I have not done yet," continued Mr. Douglass, smilingly; "knowing your
                  anti-slavery principles, sir, I thought you a fitting person to apply to, to aid a
                  few philanthropists who wish to purchase the freedom of the wife and child of an
                  escaped fugitive from Southern slavery, who has happily reached Canada in safety,
                  and who has already, by his own exertion, saved $200 for that purpose; the sum
                  demanded by the master of the woman and child is $900. I am happy to say, we have
                  raised $600, which, with the $200 saved by the husband and father, who, I think it
                  nothing but right, should contribute himself, will make $800. I have a promise of
                  $50 more, in two donations of $25 each, and I thought it might perhaps afford you
                  pleasure to unite with us in the good work."</p>
               <p>"I will give the other $50. I fancy I saw the names of the other donors in the
                     <title>Journal of Commerce,</title> this morning?" said Mr. Mordant.</p>
               <p>"You did, sir, and you will have the pleasure of seeing the amount of your own
                  generous donation added to the rest tomorrow morning. Sir, you will have aided in
                  causing the heart of an almost widowed husband, and a father, who has long been
                  deprived of a father's greatest delight, to leap for joy. Again, Mr. Mordant, I
                  say, that though, thank God! there are many—I would there were more like you."</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant filled up a check for $125, and Mr. Douglass, having cordially grasped
                  the merchant's hand, quitted the room.</p>
               <p>"Well, I have got off comparatively easy this time," said Mr. Mordant, when the
                  worthy man had gone. "One thing is satisfactory—all these donations are of a
                  nature to appear in the public prints, and the trifle will not be lost. But
                  really—"</p>
               <p>What Mr. Mordant was about to add, we must leave to the reader's imagination, as
                  he was interrupted in his soliloquy by the entrance of the servant again into the
                  room, with the silver tray in his hand.</p>
               <p>"A letter, sir, from Mr. Grindley," said he.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant received the letter, opened it, and read as follows:</p>

               <p>The merchant crumpled the letter fiercely in his hand. It seemed as though some
                  dark plot to effect his ruin were thickening around him, but he spoke not a word;
                  he sat for some<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7191-00000122"/> moments absorbed in
                  thought—then burning the letter by the flame of the candle on the table, he threw
                  it on the hearth, and watched it until the last glittering spark had vanished, and
                  the blackened and charred fragments alone remained.</p>
               <p>"I will go and join my family in the parlor," thought he, then. "If I remain here
                  any longer, I shall go mad—mad;" and he rose from his seat, extinguished the
                  candles, and descended to the parlor. He found his wife in a great state of
                  consternation, and his daughter Mary weeping bitterly. Mr. Mordant was usually a
                  man, outwardly, of calm demeanor. He seldom gave way to fits of passion—at home
                  never; but he had already suffered various vexations, and now that he had come,
                  hoping to forget his annoyances for a time, in the bosom of his family, and had
                  found them in the condition described, he could no longer control himself.</p>
               <p>"What is the meaning of this?" he demanded furiously.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mordant, without uttering a word, placed an open note, beautifully written on
                  embossed paper, in his hand. He read as follows:—</p>

                           <p>DEAR PAPA AND MAMMA:—Forgive your erring child, I know you will, after
                              your first flush of anger is past. I <emph>could not live</emph>
                              without my Henry's love. And he, poor fellow, threatened to
                                 <emph>drown himself</emph> if I hesitated to become his wife. And
                              he would have done so—I am sure he <emph>would</emph>—for he is so
                                 <emph>romantic</emph> in his notions of affection. And he knew
                              that, poor as he is, you would never give a consent to our union. Dear
                              papa and mamma—<emph>he was almost crazy,</emph> he tells me, after
                              you discharged him from the house, on account of what <emph>you
                                 considered</emph> our <emph>imprudent</emph> attachment; and when I
                              went to my aunt's at Albany, he followed me. He used to watch me,
                                 <emph>he tells me, at my bed-room window,</emph> anxious to catch
                                 <emph>only one</emph> glimpse of my form as I was about retiring to
                              rest, for <emph>nights and nights</emph> together; and, at last, he
                              ventured to meet me, and speak to me, when I was taking my walks on
                              the Troy road—<emph>Such an object of pity.</emph> I am sure
                                 <emph>you</emph> would have pitied him had you seen him—haggard,
                              and pale, and shabby, and his lovely beard and moustache all ragged,
                              and actually turned <emph>red!</emph> He says the color changed in a
                              single night, for love of me. And <emph>so</emph> shabby, poor fellow!
                              He had not the <emph>heart</emph> to dress himself tidily, thinking
                              that I scorned him. I promised to see him the next day at the same
                              hour. <emph>What else could I do?</emph> I could not witness the wreck
                                 <emph>I</emph> had made without feeling commiseration. I begged
                              him, however, to attire himself with greater propriety, so that our
                              meetings might not create impertinent observation, and he said he
                              would; but in his frantic eagerness to see me, he had left his
                              Wardrobe in New York, and had actually come down—<emph>only think of
                                 that!</emph>—without bringing any money with him beyond what he
                              needed for his travelling expenses. I immediately tent him the hundred
                              dollars you gave me when I left home. <emph>What else could I
                                 do?</emph> And my dear Henry 'looked himself again.' When next I
                              met him, which was on the following morning, even his beard and
                              moustache had regained their original, glossy black. He said it was
                              the reaction of feeling. <emph>I have read of such changes, in
                                 poetry;</emph>—does not Byron say, 'My hair turned white in a
                              single night;' and dear papa and mamma, in a moment of love's
                              intoxication, I consented to elope with him to Canada—and yesterday we
                              were married—and now, I and my dear husband sue to you for
                              forgiveness. My dearest Henry has disposed of my jewels for me, to
                              supply our immediate necessities—<emph>Pawned them,</emph> he says,
                              that is, put them <emph>somewhere,</emph> where we can get them again
                              when we have the money to <emph>redeem them,</emph> which, believing
                              in your affection, I hope will be <emph>soon,</emph> and that papa
                              will send us a letter inviting us to throw ourselves at your feet and
                              take <emph>your blessing</emph> which we are both <emph>all

                              how Henry is admired here; everybody says he is such a love of a man;
                              but we are beginning to want money already. So pray write us soon, or

               <argument>
                  <p>Which treats of Strange Matters, involving not a little Mystery.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN a former chapter we stated that the U. S. ship G——, had put into Sierra Leone,
                  after having cruised for some time up and down the coast without having been
                  fortunate enough to meet with any slavers; and there Miss Herbert was provided
                  with a passage to New Orleans on board an American bark that fortunately happened
                  then to be on the point of sailing. Poor Charlotte was glad enough at, the
                  prospect of reaching America again, after having so long been tossed about on the
                  coast of Africa, and subjected to the confinement of a ship of war, which,
                  although the captain sought to make things as comfortable to her as possible, was,
                  at the best, no very pleasant abode for a young female who had no companions of
                  her own sex on board. Still, she had been treated so kindly, and had met with so
                  much attention, that she could not help feeling sorrowful at the thought of
                  parting; and, perhaps, the future that she had to look forward to was not of the
                  brightest. We might lift the curtain now and disclose it; but it would be
                  premature, as by so doing we should forestall the events of our story. She had
                  formed an especial friendship for the young midshipman, Thomas Miller; and,
                  although she was not likely to meet with any of his friends, bound, as the vessel
                  in which she was about to sail was, to a Southern port of the Union—the young man
                  had obtained a promise from her to be the bearer of numerous letters, which she
                  was to post in New Orleans, and had also intrusted to her several messages to be
                  delivered personally, should she chance, by any fortune, to be placed in the
                  vicinity of his home.</p>
               <p>The bark in which Charlotte was to sail had loosened her fore-topsail, and the
                  anchor was nearly apeak; the boat was alongside ready to carry her on board; she
                  had bade farewell to the captain and officers, and was preparing to step over the
                  side on the ladder, assisted by one of the lieutenants, when she recollected that
                  she had left a parcel intrusted to her care by young Miller, in the gun-room, and
                  she stepped below to fetch it. The young man was on shore on boat duty, and she
                  had wished him good by an hour before. The parcel she went in search of had been
                  laid by the youngster in his chest, and he had desired her to lift the lid and
                  take possession of it when she was ready to go. It was a packet Of letters to his
                  mother and several of his young friends at home; and on raising the lid of the
                  chest Miss Herbert was surprised to see her ring (as she thought), lying in the
                  till.</p>
               <p>"How came this ring here?" she thought aloud.</p>
               <p>"Ah! I recollect—I must have dropped it while packing up those papers for Mr.
                  Miller. I took it from my bosom, where I usually keep it suspended by a ribbon,
                  with the intention of packing it in my trunk. It is fortunate that I happened to
                  come for this package of letters myself, or I should have gone away without it,"
                  and taking it up she placed it in her pocket, ascended the ladder to the deck, was
                  assisted into the boat alongside, and in a few minutes was on board the bark Susan
                  Shooter—and sailing out of the harbor with a fine fair breeze. The sloop of war
                  Buzzard, which had captured the Dolphin—after she had been disabled by the
                  pampero, arrived in Sierra Leone while the G—— was lying there, and the two
                  captains met several times together. On one occasion, the commander of the Buzzard
                  recounted to captain P——, the particulars relative to the capture of the prize.
                  "By-the-by," he continued, after he had told the story, "we are close here by the
                  hospital, suppose you step in with me and see the two negro babies, which I
                  brought from on board the slaves They must have been great pets of that atrocious
                  wretch, Junot, for the fellow had them hidden in his own bed in his cabin. They
                     were<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7191-00000124"/> soundly sleeping, poor little
                  things, when my first lieutenant took possession of the slaver, and he brought
                  them still asleep on board. They soon became great pets with my crew, and were
                  nursed as, carefully—until we arrived, in port—as ever they could have been by
                  their own mother, poor, unfortunate creature, who, I fear now is sleeping her last
                  sleep her the depths of the Atlantic; for, no doubt, she was one of the miserable
                  victims of the incarnate devil's cruelty. By G—, sir, the man who turned evidence
                  against the scoundrel—it makes my blood boil when I think of it—that man, sir, I
                  understand, proved before the court at St. Helena, that the villain Junot, who
                  murdered in cold blood the whole of the prize crew that had been put on board his
                  infernal craft, actually sunk upwards of two hundred negroes, out of his lee port
                  holes, not an hour before I came alongside of him. Had I known the facts at the
                  time, I hardly think I should have stopped to parley with him. No, sir, and the
                  captain of the sloop-of-war fairly ground his teeth together with passionate
                  indignation. "No, sir, I should have poured a broadside into him at once, and sent
                  him and his devilish crew to the bottom at once, and, if I should have done wrong,
                  why, sir, the authorities might have made the most of it. However, the villain has
                  met his reward."</p>
               <p>"The scoundrel deserved his fate," said Captain P——; "but come—where are these
                  said negro babies, who so singularly escaped the fate of the rest of the living
                  cargo?"</p>
               <p>"Come in and see them," answered the captain of the sloop-of-war. "They are in the
                  children's ward. I fancy they must be twins; and they are as pretty, interesting
                  specimens of black humanity as can be found, if you were to search the African
                  Continent. They must belong to a superior race to the generality of negroes, for
                  they are really handsome little creatures—black as a coal, but with beautifully
                  formed limbs and sleek skins, and they possess the finest and most intelligent
                  eyes I ever saw in the head of a human being."</p>
               <p>While the captain of the sloop-of-war was still expatiating upon the beauty of the
                  children, he and his companion had entered the ward of the hospital, and had
                  approached the cot where the infants lay. Captain P—— was himself astonished at
                  their beauty, and could not forbear making remarks upon the subject aloud. He was
                  overheard by one of the directors of the hospital, who happened to be near and
                  this gentleman joined the two captains.</p>
               <p>"Yes," he remarked, "they are very handsome children. It's my opinion they belong
                  to the <hi rend="i"/>Yunga Jagos tribe—a race of negroes remarkable for their
                  intelligence and physical perfection. You perceive that although they possess,
                  unmistakeably, the negro contour of feature, there is nothing coarse or repulsive
                  about them. The expression is softened down, and, but for their color they would
                  be considered handsome. Now, I have seen some of the <hi rend="i"/>Yunga Jagos
                  women, and they are really beautiful, if one could get over the prejudice of
                  color. There was one here the other day, brought in by one of our cruisers; the
                  poor thing had either sprung overboard or been thrown overboard from a slaver, of
                  which the cruiser was in chase, and the man-of-war picked her up. She was greatly
                  distressed, so we learnt from some of the negroes here, who partially understood
                  her language, for the loss of her two children, who had, she said, been shipped on
                  board another vessel. She told about their having been thrown to the lions on her
                  way down from the interior to the slave coast, and subsequently picked up
                  unharmed, for she is certain <emph>she heard them cry</emph> when she was being
                  taken on board. Now, this may be all fancy, you know, but it is a singular
                  coincidence that these two children should be brought in from another slaver, only
                  a day or two after the woman was sent to Free Town. There is something quite
                  romantic about it, and I have sent to the governor of Free Town, requesting him to
                  send the woman back here, in order that she may see the children, and, if they are
                  hers, they will of course be restored to her. I promise myself quite a tragic
                  scene, I assure you."</p>
               <p>The two captains left the hospital, and a day or two afterwards the G—— sailed for
                  the southern coast. While in the Gulf of Guinea, the wind became light and
                  baffling, and the captain found himself driven by the current out of his course,
                  and within a few leagues of the island of Annabon. The idea came into his head to
                  pay the lady of Annabon another visit.</p>
               <p>"What say you, Mr. Miller," said he, jokingly, to the young midshipman, who
                  happened to be on duty on the quarter-deck; "would you have any objection to pay
                  the fair recluse of Annabon a second visit?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I should not, sir," exclaimed the youth, with such vivacity that the
                  Captain was greatly amused.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, we will haul our wind and steer for the land. Get yourself ready, and
                  I will send you again as an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">avant courrier</foreign> to
                  the fairy of the isle."</p>
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7191-00000125"/>
               <p>The youth needed no second bidding; he went below, attired himself in full rig,
                  and, before the ship was in sight of the inlet, reported himself ready.</p>
               <p>"Then jump into the boat, and carry the lady a message from me to the same purport
                  as the last; and mind, youngster, don't lose your heart altogether before you come
                  on board again."</p>
               <p>Young Miller descended into the boat, and in a few minutes sprang on the beach,
                  and hurried off in the direction of the locality of the cottage.</p>
               <p>In the course of an, hour and a half he was back on board the frigate again.</p>
               <p>"Come on board, sir," said he, giving the usual salute.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, and what says the lady?"</p>
               <p>"If you please, sir, I can't find her."</p>
               <p>"Can't find her! Is she not in the cottage?"</p>
               <p>"The cottage is no longer there, sir."</p>
               <p>"Why, boy," said the captain, laughing, "this witch has driven you crazy. Do you
                  know what you are talking about?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. I have seen one of the negroes, who speaks a few words of English. He
                  says that the <hi rend="i"/>Obeah burned the cottage with fire from heaven, and
                  that the lady was spirited away. The negroes have all left the neighborhood. None
                  of them will reside there now; but I saw the place where the cottage stood, and
                  the ground and trees are burned and charred all around the spot."</p>
               <p>"By Jove! the boy's crazy, I declare," exclaimed the captain; but observing that
                  the youth looked greatly troubled and perplexed, he added, "I will go on shore
                  myself. Stay in the boat, my lads," addressing the men alongside. "And you, Mr.
                  Miller, had better remain on board. If I find the lady, I promise you, since you
                  appear to take her loss so much to heart, you shall visit her."</p>
               <p>The captain went on shore and bent his footsteps towards the cottage, and to his
                  astonishment he found it was as the young midshipman had reported. Not a vestige
                  of the recently lovely residence and beautiful garden was to be found, Even the
                  cottages of the negroes in the vicinity were vacated, and where, but a short time
                  before, all was life and beauty, was now gloom and desolation. The captain fell in
                  with the negro who had furnished young Miller with his information. The man could
                  speak very little English, but the captain made out that he believed the <hi
                     rend="i"/>Obeah had carried off the lady and blighted the spot. He spoke of
                  strange sights seen there at night, and endeavored to explain many strange stories
                  of negro superstition. (Seymour was now believed by the simple negroes to be the
                     <hi rend="i"/>Obeah—a being partaking of the attributes both of a god and a
                  devil—in human form). "And the <hi rend="i"/>Obeah," said the negro, "who had
                  brought the lady there many years ago, and who was so mighty and rich that he
                  could make people bow and fait dead by the glance of his eye, had taken affront,
                  because so many white folks had been of late to see the lady, and he had cursed
                  the place, and flown away with the lady in the midst of the fire he had created by
                  his breath." This was all that could be got out of him respecting Zuleika, for the
                  man seemed afraid to speak on the subject, and threw frightened glances towards
                  the spot as he told his story. This, as the reader will be aware, was the
                  impression Seymour sought to create, by removing Zuleika secretly, and burning the
                  residence in which she had resided. He wished to throw as much mystery as possible
                  upon the matter.</p>
               <p>Captain P——, however, had his own opinion, and he had no doubt that, as the negro
                  had said, the lady's husband, father, or lover—what or whoever he might be—had
                  received intimation, perhaps from herself, that visitors had grown numerous, and
                  had consequently removed her, and sought to create this impression amongst the
                  negroes. This, however, was not all the mystery. The negro added that the <hi
                     rend="i"/>Obeah had sunk a vessel in the bay that night by blowing upon it, and
                  all but one man had sunk with it. The survivor was the captain, who had somehow
                  made his escape, and had been seen wandering upon the beach the day afterwards;
                  but the negroes were afraid to speak to him, for the curse of the <hi rend="i"
                  />Obeah was upon him, and he had wandered into the woods, and whether he had died
                  there or not the negro did not know. Perhaps he had gone to the other side of the
                  island, and gone away in some vessel.</p>
               <p>This was a strange story altogether, and much increased the mystery around the
                  White Lady of Annabon; but it was all the captain could learn, and he returned on
                  board the vessel, and related the tale to his wondering officers.</p>
               <p>"If you please, sir, could I speak with you alone?" asked young Miller, touching
                  his cap.</p>
               <p>"Certainly," replied the captain. "What do you wish to tell me—anything concerning
                  the vanished lady?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," answered the youth.</p>
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7191-00000126"/>
               <p>"Oh, it is, is it?" answered the captain; "out with it, then?"</p>
               <p>It's a long story, sir, but I'll make it as short as possible. This lady, whoever
                  she was, when we were here before, sent me a letter and a ring—"</p>
               <p>"The d—I she did!" interrupted the captain. "That was rapid correspondence and
                  quick courtship, in all conscience, seeing you had only seen her twice; both times
                  on the same day."</p>
               <p>"Please hear me out, sir. She sent me a letter, and a ring, for which she said she
                  had no use, as she was my sister—"</p>
               <p>The captain burst but into a fit of laughter.</p>
               <p>"Very reasonable indeed of the lady," said he, at length. "She sent you a ring,
                  because, being your sister, of course she couldn't be your wife; but who gave her
                  the ring, boy? You, I presume, on the occasion of your first visit. Prompt work,
                  Mr. Miller, prompt work. Well?"</p>
               <p>"She wasn't my sister, sir, and the ring was a ring that my mother wore on her
                  finger the very day I left home."</p>
               <p>Again the captain roared with laughter.</p>
               <p>"The boy's crazy," said he, as soon as he could speak.</p>
               <p>"Do, pray, sir, hear me out," begged the youth. "This ring, which was of singular
                  appearance, and. which had the first letter of my sister Jane's name engraved
                  inside, I placed for safety in the till of my chest. I have never looked at it
                  particularly since; but I could almost swear it must have been there yesterday,
                  and I always keep the till of my chest locked."</p>
               <p>"Well," interrupted the captain, seeing the youth hesitate.</p>
               <p>"If you please, sir, the ring has been spirited way, I believe, while I was on
                  shore just now. When I came on board, after finding that the lady was gone, I went
                  for the first time, after we left Sierra Leone, to look at this ring. It was gone;
                  and yet, since we left port, the till has been locked and the key has been in my
                  pocket. And what's more, it was locked just now."</p>
               <p>"The boy's mad for certain," said the captain. "How came the girl to know you had
                  a sister? Have you one?"</p>
               <p>"I did have, sir, but she is dead or missing—no one knows where."</p>
               <p>A sudden idea seemed to strike the captain. It might be the missing sister of the
                  youth, after all, and she might have recognized him on his visit on shore.</p>
               <p>"How long has your sister been missing?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"A few months only before I left home."</p>
               <p>"Then you would know her were you to see her?"</p>
               <p>"Know Jane, sir! To be sure I would."</p>
               <p>"Is she anything like this lady?"</p>
               <p>"Like <emph>her,</emph> sir! no more than I am. She is taller, stouter, and of
                  darker complexion." The idea born of the captain's brain fell to the ground. The
                  recluse of Annabon could not by any chance have been the missing girl.</p>
               <p>"And where do you suppose your ring is?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"On my mother's finger, in New York," said the youth, "where it came from."</p>
               <p>"The boy is certainly crazy," thought the captain, shaking his head. "You said you
                  had a letter from the lady, as well as the ring. Where is the letter?"</p>
               <p>"Here, sir," said the youth, taking the crumpled sheet from his pocket.</p>
               <p>The captain took it and read it, and was as much perplexed as the boy himself.</p>
               <p>"There is some mystery about this I cannot fathom," he said. "The letter, at any
                  rate, seems to be genuine."</p>
               <p>He gave it back. "Keep that letter, Mr. Miller," said he; "it may furnish, some
                  day, a clue to the history of this strange being; but, for heaven's sake, don't
                  tell any one else, or you will never hear the last of it. How could it be possible
                  that the ring could come into this girl's possession—or how could it get out of
                  yours? That girl has bewitched you, and you have been dreaming, till you have
                  believed your dreams to be reality."</p>
               <p>"I am no more dreaming than you are," muttered the youth to himself, as, touching
                  his cap respectfully to the captain, he walked away.</p>
               <p>The captain said nothing about the letter to the officers, and young Miller,
                  finding how little he had gained by informing the captain of the witchcraft to
                  which he believed he had been subjected, kept his own counsel for the future. He
                  determined to write, however, and after telling the story to his mother, to ask,
                  if for any time during his absence, she had missed, or laid aside the ring, and
                  whether she still possessed it.</p>
               <p>For a long time after this, the singular circumstances connected with the White
                  Lady of Annabon, and her strange and mysterious disappearance, were fruitful
                  themes of discourse amongst the officers at the mess table.</p>

               <p>TWO months had passed since we left Zuleika on board her husband's vessel, on the
                  north side of the Island of Annabon, and in a preceding chapter we have mentioned
                  how, in his letter to Mr. Mordant, Seymour stated his intention to resign for a
                  while the command of the Albatross, and go to the Mediterranean, for what purpose
                  he did not choose to tell.</p>
               <p>We have mentioned also that Seymour, at an earlier period of his life, had been
                  engaged on board a Greek pirate vessel. In the first instance more from necessity
                  than from inclination—and that he had distinguished himself by his reckless
                  courage, and acquired his thorough knowledge of seamanship amongst the Islands of
                  the Grecian Archipelago.</p>
               <p>At the entrance of the Gulf of Salonica in the Ægean Sea are situated a group of
                  small islands, comprising the north-westernmost portion of the Cyclades. Many of
                  these islands are fertile in the extreme, others are comparatively barren, but all
                  are exceedingly picturesque; located in that glorious clime, and on the bosom of
                  that sunny sea, they could scarcely be otherwise. Most of them are inhabited by
                  fishermen, generally of the Greek race, although a few Mohammedan renegades may be
                  found amongst them. The inhabitants are generally poor; that is, they possess no
                  articles of luxury—they need them not—they would not know how to use them; but
                  poor to destitution they are not, for the sea that washes the shores of these
                  rocky islets abounds with fish and furnishes an abundance of food at the cost of
                  little trouble, and the fertile soil almost spontaneously provides such vegetables
                  and fruits as the appetites of the simple, rude islanders require. For centuries
                  past the Cyclades have been noted for being the strong-holds of pirates, whose
                  deeds of valor and ferocity have been the theme of many a minstrel's song; but
                  these strong-holds were generally located amongst the more southerly and larger
                  islands of the Archipelago. On one of these islands—one of the smallest, yet one
                  of the most picturesque of the group—one so small, so insignificant that
                  geographers have not given it a name—Seymour, whose earlier career had rendered
                  him well acquainted with the tortuous windings and intricate channels of this
                  beautiful yet treacherous sea, had fixed the abode of his fair bride, and scorning
                  the uncouth name given to the islet by the Greek fishermen, he called it
                  "Zuleika's Isle."</p>
               <p>He had sailed from St. Louis on the African coast, as he had intimated to Mr.
                  Mordant, to Marseilles; thence, still taking Jane Miller, as Zuleika's companion,
                  he had taken passage to Mileto, where he had purchased a Greek felucca, and having
                  stored it with everything he thought immediately necessary or desirable for the
                  comfort or gratification of Zuleika, he had engaged a crew of Greek sailors, and
                  himself taking the command of the little craft, had steered his way amongst the
                  Cyclades until he had reached this island, which, from its position, its
                  fertility, and its picturesque beauty, he had chosen for the new abode of his
                  bride.</p>
               <p>Seymour had a sufficiency of money at his command. During his successful career in
                  the slave trade, he had had abundant opportunity to amass wealth, and reckless as
                  lie appeared, he had ever cherished a hope that one day—and that day, at least,
                  before the noontide of manhood had passed away—he might be enabled to retire from
                  the sea, and perchance, reform his life, and spend his later years happily in the
                  society of his beloved Zuleika; consequently he readily obtained control over the
                  rude and simple people amongst whom he was about to locate himself; and before he
                  had been many days upon the island, he was looked upon by the few fishermen and
                  their families as its lord and master.</p>
               <p>At the door of a small cottage—which, although originally built in the rude style
                  of the huts on the island, had, in the course of a few weeks, been so much
                  improved and beautified under the direction of Seymour, as to render it not only a
                  comfortable, but, in comparison with the other habitations of the island, a
                  luxurious abode—one evening, about a month after they had landed and taken
                  possession, sat Seymour and Zuleika, beneath a rustic porch tresselled with grape
                     vines<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7191-00000128"/> and honey-suckles; before
                  them, at the distance of a few hundred yards, was the sea, and a short distance
                  from the shore lay the felucca that had been purchased to bring them to the
                  island, and which was still retained by Seymour, who had frequently made
                  excursions amongst the "Thousand Islands," with Zuleika and Jane Miller, since
                  they had taken up their abode in this spot. The crew of the felucca, who chose; to
                  live on board, were singing a Greek chorus, and the melody of their voices—so pure
                  was the air—was distinctly heard where Seymour; and his wife were sitting. Jane
                  Miller was wandering pensively along the shore, gazing at the golden sunset, and
                  admiring the beautiful effect of its fading beams upon the water; here glistening
                  like a sea of molten silver where it was open to the west, and there, dark in
                  comparison, as a Lethean stream, where the dark shadows of the craggy islets and
                  rocks, shut out its dying rays. In sooth, it was a glorious scene, and the fairy
                  vista and the sunset hour had their effect upon the minds of the gazers. Perchance
                  it imparted to them a tinge of melancholy, for both sat silent for some time,
                  watching the receding orb of day, sinking like a ball of fire into the ocean,
                  deeper and deeper still, until the last expiring ray had disappeared, and the
                  stars shone out, and the moon sailed in queenly beauty through the transparent
                  atmosphere; and, as if touched by the fairy hand of an enchanter, the entire scene
                  appeared to have undergone a magical transformation—and now the boatmen had ceased
                  their evening song, and a solemn stillness pervaded the island, unbroken, save by
                  the gentle murmur of the billows as they broke in tiny waves upon the pebbly
                  beach; then Seymour spoke.</p>
               <p>"And how do you like this our new abode, my Zuleika?" he asked, drawing the girl
                  closer to him by the hand he had hitherto held clasped in his own, and passing his
                  left arm around her slender form.</p>
               <p>"How can I do otherwise than like it, George?" she replied, "am not I a Greek
                  girl? I know not how it is perhaps it is mere instinct—the effect of my breathing
                  again my native air—but since I have been here, I have been happier than I ever
                  was before. I like the savage beauty of this scenery—better, far better than the
                  gorgeous scenery of Annabon. And then, George, you are here with me, and have
                  staid longer with me than you have ever done before at any one time. Perhaps it is
                  that which makes me so lightsome and joyous."</p>
               <p>An expression of pain shot across the features of Seymour, but he made no reply,
                  and Zuleika, after sitting some moments silent, continued—</p>
               <p>"How beautiful is night upon the sea-shore! Does not the vista before us look like
                  a scene of enchantment? Let us walk down to the beach, George, and join Harry,
                  there. I think I like our night rambles best, and yet all seasons are beautiful as
                  they come. I will tell you a secret, George. I have written a song in Spanish and
                  tuned it to the accompaniment of the guitar, and to-night when we return I will
                  sing it to you."</p>
               <p>"So you are a poetess?" said Seymour, smiling fondly upon the young girl as he
                  rose from his seat to accompany her to the beach.</p>
               <p>"Oh, sometimes I try to write down ray thoughts and set them to music, but my
                  attempts are but feeble. I tried to write English, George, but I am not yet
                  sufficiently mistress of your native tongue—so you must translate my song into
                  English poetry for, me."</p>
               <p>"Do you like the English language, Zuleika?"</p>
               <p>"I like it because it is your native tongue."</p>
               <p>"And for nothing else?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but for that most; but I like to read English poetry—still I think my native
                  Greek, and even my adopted Spanish more melodious."</p>
               <p>"Ah! what is that?" said Seymour, as they passed by a thick copse of trees, whence
                  issued a tall female form, gliding past them almost like a spectre and rapidly
                  disappearing amidst the gloom.</p>
               <p>"It is that strange woman, George, who comes here from one of the other Islands,
                  to dispose of mats and other articles she weaves from rushes. The fishermen say
                  she is a witch and they fear and avoid her."</p>
               <p>"I have never seen her before," said Seymour.</p>
               <p>"She has come several times near our cottage when you were away in the felucca—but
                  I have never seen her face. She seems to watch me closely and yet to wish to avoid
                  me, I should be frightened, George, if you were not with me, to meet her at this
                  hour."</p>
               <p>Seymour smiled—"I don't suppose, darling, there is anything for you to be grated
                  at in the poor woman. Some poor creature, I suppose, who has become childish with
                  age. The people of these islands are very superstitious."</p>
               <p>They passed on to the beach and met Jane Miller, who was returning towards the
                  cottage. She turned back with them,<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7191-00000129"/> and
                  after a short ramble on the margin of the shore, they returned to their abode.</p>
               <p>"Now, love," said Seymour, "bring your guitar and let me hear you sing the song
                  you spoke of, and to-morrow I will endeavor to do my part and translate it into
                  English.?"</p>
               <p>Zuleika passed into the cottage for the purpose of procuring her guitar, leaving
                  Seymour and Jane, or Harry, as the young woman was now always called by Zuleika as
                  well as Seymour, sitting in the porch. In a few moments she returned with the
                  instrument, but she was frightened and almost breathless, and laying down the
                  guitar, she threw herself into her husband's arms.</p>
               <p>"Zuleika, darling, what ails you?" asked Seymour, while Jane rose from her seat
                  and came forward anxious to render assistance.</p>
               <p>"That strange woman! dear George. She was looking in the little window of our
                  bedroom when I went to fetch the guitar, and she shook her head menancingly at me,
                  and then disappeared."</p>
               <p>"Poor little, timid thing," said Seymour, kissing her cheek, "you should not be so
                  easily alarmed. The old woman can do you no harm, at least, while I am here to
                  protect you; but I will see to her, darling, to-morrow, and take precautions to
                  prevent her returning to the island. No doubt, as I observed before, she is some
                  poor, half-crazed creature. Now, where is the guitar, dear?"</p>
               <p>"You will excuse me from singing the song to-night, dear George. I know how silly
                  it is; but I was so shocked when I saw that woman shake her long, skinny arm at
                  me, that my heart flew to my throat. I would rather not sing, to-night,
                  George."</p>
               <p>"Just as you please, love, but you will sing me that song to-morrow. I must hear
                  it."</p>
               <p>"I will sing it as often as you please."</p>
               <p>"Well, then we will retire for the night; the sun has gone down more than an hour,
                  and I warrant all the people on the island, except this bugbear of an old woman,
                  are fast asleep. I have a score to settle with the old witch for frightening you,
                  love, and depriving me of the song, and Harry, too."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Harry has heard it," said Zuleika, looking up into her husband's face, and
                  smiling.</p>
               <p>"So you gave him the preference, eh?"</p>
               <p>"I sung it to him first, that I might be able to sing it the more perfectly to
                  you, dear; that's all," said Zuleika, smiling archly.</p>
               <p>"You are a dear little flatterer," was Seymour's reply, as they entered the
                  cottage together.</p>
               <p>Ere another hour had passed every human being, save one, on Zuleika's Isle, was
                  wrapped in slumber—that one was the mysterious old woman already alluded to. It
                  was near the hour of midnight when she again approached the cottage and peered in
                  at the window; the moonbeams were shining through the casement and casting their
                  faint light full on the faces of the unconscious sleepers. The woman gazed long
                  and earnestly, and then noiselessly rettired, muttering almost inaudibly to
                  herself in the Romaic dialect.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE morning dawned, sweetly as the summer morning ever dawns upon the beauteous
                  islands of the Ægean sea, which, blessed with a fertile soil, a beautiful and
                  delightful climate and scenery of a wild and savage, yet beautiful and enchanting
                  character, are doubly fascinating to the educated voyager, in consequence of the
                  classical associations connected with them. On one of the group, says tradition at
                  least, was born the prince of poets and minstrels—he whose strains have never been
                  equalled—"the blind old man of Scio's rocky isle." On another (Patmos) the Apostle
                  St. John, wrote, while in exile, the inspired Revelations. All are more or less
                  associated with the most glorious recollections of classical antiquity. Now the
                  abode of poor fishermen and desperate pirates—they were once the cradles of genius
                  and human progress, and he who can sail among the extensive group, and navigate
                  the tortuous windings of their channels, or can wander on their now thinly peopled
                  and neglected soil, with a heart unstirred, must be wanting in soul—we envy not
                  his stolid frigidity.</p>
               <p>Zuleika arose with the dawn of day from, her light slumbers; the sun, just risen
                  from the deep, was casting his early morning rays through the window of the bed
                  chamber; the sweet briar<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7191-00000130"/> and honey
                  suckles which clambered up the side of the cottage, and clung in graceful festoons
                  around the casement, diffused their fragrant perfume throughout the room; the
                  birds sang their blithe and joyous matin songs; and the cool breeze, fresh from
                  the sea seemed to impart new vitality to the vegetation and an air of gladness to
                  the scene.</p>
               <p>Zuleika opened the casement and gazed abroad; the sea, calm and smooth as a
                  mirror, lay before her, the sunbeams dancing upon its surface, and dazzling the
                  eye with their brilliancy; and the gentle breeze as it played amongst the foliage
                  of the trees breathed forth a sweeter and more soul-subduing melody than any that
                  art is capable of producing. The Greek girl turned from the window and stepped to
                  the couch on which Seymour was still reposing.</p>
               <p>"Wake love—wake," she said, touching him lightly with her fingers; "see what a
                  lovely morning. It is a shame to be sleeping while the sun is shining so brightly,
                  and the birds singing so joyously, and all nature looking so glad. Wake, dearest,
                  and let us stroll down to the beach and gather shells and pebbles, and breathe the
                  pure fresh air from the sea."</p>
               <p>And Seymour sprang from his couch, and snatching a kiss from the lips of his
                  lovely bride he soon prepared himself to accompany her in her favorite morning
                  ramble.</p>
               <p>"We will go to the little grotto by the sea-side beneath the cliff, where there is
                  such a delightful view of the gulf for miles," said he. "And Zuleika, darling,
                  bring your guitar with you, and you shall sing me the song you spoke of, which was
                  so un-opportunely interrupted last night. It will sound all the sweeter, love, by
                  the sea-side, where the tiny billows, as they break upon the pebbles and roll up
                  and recede from the beach, will murmur a pleasing chorus.</p>
               <p>Zuleika took her guitar, and together they strolled towards the grotto, which was
                  distant about a mile from the cottage, and was a natural cave worn into the rock,
                  at some anterior period—perhaps centuries before—when the sea must have encroached
                  far beyond the boundary of its then high-water mark; and having reached it, they
                  seated themselves upon a rustic seat studded with sea-shells, and rendered soft
                  and elastic by carefully dried and prepared seaweed, which Seymour, assisted by
                  Zuleika and Jane Miller, had amused themselves with arranging.</p>
               <p>"Now, dear, for the song you promised me—where is Harry, though?"</p>
               <p>"He left the cottage before us," replied Zuleika, "he always rises early and
                  wanders into the wood by himself."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, he'll lose the song, though, by-the-by, you told me you had already
                  sang it to him. What is its burden, darling?"</p>
               <p>"It is merely an idle song relating to every-day occurrences," answered Zuleika.
                  "It is a call, for you to rise early in the morning, dear George; such a call as I
                  gave you this morning—oh! you are a sad sluggard."</p>
               <p>"I believe I must plead guilty to that," said Seymour gaily, but he added to
                  himself, "would to God I could sleep as soundly and calmly in the night season as
                  you—poor, innocent, unsuspecting child."</p>
               <p>Zuleika, meanwhile, had tuned the guitar, and then she sang the following simple
                  song in Spanish. We have given the translation, roughly made by Seymour, on the
                  following day—which Zuleika exerted herself to commit to memory, because her
                  husband delighted to hear her sing in English—although the task was no light one
                  to one who had but a short time before taken her first lesson in the English
                  tongue: <q>

               </p>
               <p>Zuleika ceased her song, and smilingly looked up into Seymour's face, awaiting his
                  approval.</p>
               <p>"I was not aware you were so pretty a poetess, my Zuleika," said he. "I maybe
                  partial; but I think that a very pretty song. To-morrow I will try to translate it
                  into English, and then you will learn to sing it in that language, won't you dear?
                  I am afraid that my humble poetic powers will be unable to do justice to the
                  Spanish composition. However, I will do my best. Let us return to breakfast, love.
                  The sun has been up two hours; it must be eight o'clock. After breakfast I have
                  something to say to you."</p>
               <p>They returned to the cottage, and when the simple meal was finished proceeded to
                  busy themselves, assisted by Jane Miller, in the cultivation of a little plot of
                  ground around the cottage, which Seymour had staked in, to form into a garden.
                  Zuleika however, bethought herself of Seymour's remark, that he had something to
                  say to her.</p>
               <p>"What was it you wished to speak to me about, dear George?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Come into this little summer house, darling, and I will tell you. I have been a
                  long time staying with you in your new home, Zuleika."</p>
               <p>"Oh, it has not seemed long to me; 'tis but a few weeks, George," replied Zuleika,
                  whose cheeks flushed as she spoke in a tremulous voice, for she anticipated what
                  was coming, and dreaded to hear her husband say that he was about to leave
                  her.</p>
               <p>"I have stayed with you longer than I ever remained before, dearest, since I left
                  you at school in Spain."</p>
               <p>"And you will not leave me again," interrupted Zuleika, placing her hand in that
                  of her husband, her breast heaving with suppressed agitation.</p>
               <p>"Zuleika, I must; but I trust it will be for the last time. When I return again, I
                  hope it will be to remain with you always, here, or else I shall take you with me
                  to America."</p>
               <p>Zuleika threw herself, weeping, into her husband's arms.</p>
               <p>"Compose yourself, darling," he said. "Nay, Zuleika, this is foolish. I thought
                  you had more fortitude. I do not go immediately. I shall yet remain here a
                  fortnight, and I shall leave Harry still with you to bear you company till my
                  return. Come, dry your eyes, and let me see you smile—that's right—that's a brave
                  girl. Think, dear; when we meet again it will be to part no more while life
                  remains."</p>
               <p>Zuleika sat for some minutes silent, endeavoring to subdue her emotion, her head
                  resting upon her husband's shoulder.</p>
               <p>He did not speak to her, but sat awaiting some remark from her lips. At length she
                  said:</p>
               <p>"You said, George, that you would leave Harry with me; are you sure that he will
                  stay; have you spoken to him on the subject?"</p>
               <p>"No, dear, but I have little doubt that he will remain, if I wish him to do so. He
                  is a strange boy—little fitted to bear<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7191-00000132"/>
                  the hardships of a sailor's life. I never heard his history—it must be a singular
                  one. Did he ever speak to you of his friends or of his past life, Zuleika?"</p>
               <p>"He has, George, and it <emph>is</emph> a strange history; but I promised that
                  until he chose to speak of it to others himself, I would never betray his
                  secret."</p>
               <p>"He it so, dear. Keep your own counsel if you choose," said Seymour, laughing. "I
                  suppose it is some romantic episode. The boy has been crossed in love, or
                  something of that sort—eh? Well, he is young, and will get over it. Meanwhile, I
                  don't think he will be happier anywhere than with you, and when I return I will
                  consider what I shall do with him."</p>
               <p>"But you have not asked him, dear. How do you know that he will consent to remain?
                  You would not wish, him to stay if he should express a desire to return home to
                  his friends?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly not; though I should have to send him home as a passenger in some ship
                  from Spain, or the south of France. But I will speak to him to-day; Now, dear, let
                  us finish planting the flowerbed we commenced yesterday. I must put the garden, in
                  complete order before I leave."</p>
               <p>On the evening of that day, Seymour took an opportunity of questioning Jane Miller
                  as to her wishes with regard to returning to America.</p>
               <p>"Harry," said he, "in a few days I am going to leave the island, and shall proceed
                  to the south of France, and thence take passage to America. What say you,
                  boy—Zuleika is fond of your society; she has no one with her but strangers,
                  excepting yourself and Julia, her old negress attendant from Annabon. Do you wish
                  to return home, or will you remain with Zuleika until my return?"</p>
               <p>Jane had thought much on this subject. Her heart yearned to see her poor, forsaken
                  parent again; and she grieved at the consequences of her past conduct, all the
                  more bitterly, since the interview she, unknown to him, had had with her brother
                  on the occasion of the first visit of the G—— to Annabon. Still she dreaded to
                  return as much or more than she grieved to remain longer absent. She felt that she
                  had placed a gulf between herself and her friends which, were she to seek to
                  cross, might overwhelm her. She had committed a breach of the laws of society,
                  which surrounded her with as many difficulties to combat against as though she had
                  actually been guilty of an unpardonable crime. Deeply she deplored her past folly;
                  but she knew that having strayed from the beaten path of social conventionalities,
                  her return was impossible. At all events a longer stay with Zuleika, for whom she
                  felt a warm and sisterly friendship, provided Zuleika herself were desirous she
                  should stay, would give her time to arrange a plan of future operations; besides,
                  she pitied, sincerely pitied Zuleika; and then her woman's curiosity stepped in,
                  and claimed a portion of her thoughts. She was anxious to know what would
                  eventually become of the loving, unsuspicious Greek girl. She therefore
                  replied:</p>
               <p>"I am willing to stay, Captain Seymour, if Zuleika is desirous that I should
                  remain."</p>
               <p>"Then I can tell her that you will remain with her on the island."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"You are a good lad, Harry, and the day may come when I shall have it in my power
                  to push your fortunes. I will not forget the services you have rendered me—depend
                  upon that. Now, go and tell Zuleika the determination at which you have
                  arrived."</p>
               <p>The day of Seymour's departure was rapidly drawing near. The felucca had been got
                  in readiness for a sea voyage, and it was Seymour's intention to proceed to
                  Valetta, in the Island of Malta, and then to discharge his Greek crew, and after
                  disposing of the felucca, to take passage to the South of Prance (Toulon or
                  Marseilles) and thence to proceed to New York and ascertain from Mr. Mordant how
                  matters had prospered with regard to the Albatross during his temporary secession
                  from the command of that vessel.</p>
               <p>He and his bride and Jane Miller often cruised around in the felucca amongst the
                  islands in the vicinity of Zuleika's Isle, and occasionally he took a trip alone
                  to some one of the larger islands for the purpose of procuring such articles as he
                  required for the promotion of Zuleika's comfort and convenience during his
                  absence, and which could not be readily obtained on the islet which he had chosen
                  for her abode. A week had passed away since the conversation above recorded had
                  taken place. During that time the old woman alluded to in a preceding chapter had
                  not been seen, and she had been forgotten by both Seymour and his bride. One day,
                  however, Zuleika rushed into the cottage from the garden, alarm depicted in her
                  countenance. On being asked by Seymour what had occasioned her fright, she said
                  that she had again seen the<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7191-00000133"/> dreaded and
                  mysterious woman cautiously watching her from a covert of trees in the rear of the
                  garden.</p>
               <p>"By heaven!" exclaimed Seymour, "this is unendurable; I will see to it
                  immediately, love, and cause a stop to be put to this annoyance; although, after
                  all, I imagine, as I have said before, she is some poor foolish creature who is an
                  object of pity rather than fear."</p>
               <p>He walked down that day to the little hamlet inhabited by the fishermen who made
                  the island their abode—the only hamlet the island contained—and made inquiry
                  regarding the woman.</p>
               <p>"She comes from Lemnos, Excellenza," said one of the fishermen, "in one of the
                  boats that occasionally visit this island, to dispose of mats and such like
                  trifles. She came here yesterday, and departed in the same boat scarcely two hours
                  since. Poor thing! she is mad, Excellenza, the evil eye is upon her."</p>
               <p>"Do you know any harm of her—is she hated or feared by the people here?"</p>
               <p>Hated! no, Excellenza; but she is pitied by some, and feared by others; but there
                  is no harm in her, I believe. There are strange tales abroad with regard to her.
                  It is said she once knew better days. Excellenza, she has the gift of
                  prophecy."</p>
               <p>Seymour said no more, but he determined to go to Lemnos and find out the woman, if
                  possible, and prevent any future annoyance to Zuleika. He walked along the shore
                  until he reached the spot where the felucca lay at anchor, and stepping into the
                  cobble boat, he paddled on board, and ordered the lateen sail to be hoisted and
                  the anchor weighed, and in a few minutes the little vessel was under headway for
                  the island of Lemnos, which was just visible in the distance. He had learnt from
                  the fishermen that the old woman was called Marca, and that she had suffered from
                  reverses of fortune to such a degree that her reason had become impaired.
                  Tradition said her ancestors lorded it with sovereign rule over the larger and
                  more fertile islands of the Cyclades, and that she herself had been the bride of a
                  great freebooter chieftain. In the course of an hour the felucca's anchor was
                  dropped off the small harbor of Lemnos, and Seymour went ashore, resolved, if
                  possible, to discover the abode and seek an interview with Marca.</p>
               <p>He learnt, by making inquiry of the inhabitants of the island, that the object of
                  his search resided in solitary seclusion in a wretched hut deeply embosomed in a
                  dark wood a short distance from the sea-side.</p>
               <p>"But, Excellenza," asked his informant, "what would you seek from the dark woman
                  of Lemnos? Marca hath an evil eye, and a tongue prone to prophesy terrible things.
                  Beware, Excellenza, beware."</p>
               <p>"<foreign>Egov, sas euxagistou</foreign> (I thank you) for the warning," replied
                  Seymour, who had addressed the man in the Romaic dialect—the vernacular of the
                  islands; "but, my friend, I fear her not; nevertheless, I thank you."</p>
               <p>The fisherman inclined his head and placed his hand upon his breast. "Excellenza,"
                  said he, "<foreign>Me kanetee megalen timen</foreign>" (you do me too muck
                  honor).</p>
               <p>Following the path which he had been told would carry him to the hut of Marca,
                  Seymour found himself in the course of a few minutes deep in the bosom of the
                  wood, and, about half a mile from the entrance, he discovered by the smoke that
                  issued from a spot where the trees grew thicker than common, that he was in the
                  vicinity of the abode he sought. He approached the spot cautiously—he did not wish
                  to alarm the old woman, and besides, he felt a strange sensation creeping over him
                  that could not actually be described as fear, and which was yet near akin to it.
                  Brave as a lion where danger was openly present, Seymour was still, like most
                  imaginative persons, a little given to superstition, and the strange character he
                  had heard of the old woman, and her singular desire to haunt the abode of his
                  bride when he was absent, troubled him; and now the dark, solitary, savage aspect
                  of Marca's hut, so embedded amidst the thickest foliage of the wood that the
                  cheering light of the sun's rays was almost shut out, and the glare of a charcoal
                  fire that was burning in front of the hut, and tinting the confined landscape with
                  its lurid hues, presented a scene eminently calculated to awaken any latent
                  feelings of superstition he possessed. In front of the fire Marca herself was
                  seated, with her back turned towards the intruder upon her savage solitude. She
                  was attired in a loose wrapper of scarlet color, and of coarse material, and on
                  her head she wore a conical woollen cap, from which her elfin locks escaped in
                  long tangled ringlets, and although her appearance generally betokened extreme
                  age, these tangled elfin locks were still untouched by the hand of time, and
                  streamed down over her scarlet wrapper in vivid contrast with its bright color.
                  She was busily occupied in weaving rushes together, and at the same time
                  superintending some culinary operation that was going forward, in an earthen
                  pip-kin, raised upon a tripod over the fire, and from the closed lid<pb
                     n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7191-00000134"/> of which the steam was rapidly
                  escaping; at the back of the fire a huge piece of half charred wood was sending
                  forth columns of suffocating smoke, and this smoke it was which had first warned
                  Seymour of his proximity to the hut of the Sibyl. Marca neither saw nor heard the
                  approach of her visitor, or at least she showed no sign of having done so, for
                  Seymour approached close to her, and watched the rapid movements of her skinny
                  fingers, as she pursued her avocation, chanting, as she did so, some rude Romaic
                  rhyme, but she neither turned nor spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Seymour cleared his throat, and coughed, and stamped his foot upon the earth, in
                  hopes of attracting her attention. Still she neither spoke, nor heeded him. At
                  length he addressed Her with the usual Romaic salutation:</p>
               <p>"<foreign>No, ze</foreign>—<foreign>na ze</foreign> (long life), good Marca."</p>
               <p>"<foreign>Ti opisete kur?</foreign>" (What is your pleasure, signor?) she replied,
                  still without turning her head.</p>
               <p>"I have sought the aged Marca," answered Seymour," to ask if she needs the
                  assistance of a wealthy stranger; I come from yonder small island," pointing his
                  finger in the direction of Zuleika's Isle, although the old woman was not looking
                  at him. "I have seen Marca there, seeking to sell her wares. Such toil is unfitted
                  for one of her years; I would render her position easy—say, Marca, how can I
                  assist you?"</p>
               <p>"Signor, you speak with, a false tongue," replied the aged female, "that is not
                  the object of your journey hither; I knew you would come; I have waited many years
                  for the appearance of you and your young bride. Last night, when the stars
                  betokened that it was the hour of midnight, I had a vision, and I knew then you
                  would come here to seek me to-day in my hut. It was for that reason I hastened
                  home so soon from the island on which you have fixed your bride's abode. But,
                  signor, strive not to deceive one who has dealings with those wiser and more
                  powerful than you, and who can penetrate into the secret mysteries of the human
                  soul. You came not to do me service, but because you feared harm from me towards
                  your dainty bride. Is it not so?" she added, with startling energy, springing at
                  the same moment to her feet, her tall wiry frame stretched to its full height, and
                  for the first time confronting her visitor. "Is it not so, I ask?"</p>
               <p>"And if it is?" replied Seymour, who was startled by the woman's strange
                  energy.</p>
               <p>But she did not immediately reply. She scrutinized her visitor's itor's appearance
                  from head to foot, muttering to herself in a soliloquising manner, as though she
                  were alone, and unheard by any human being.</p>
               <p>"Fair to look upon; goodly in stature, tall and straight as the cedar; but though
                  fair without, blighted at the core by the canker worm of remorse. Your hand,
                  signor. I would read your destiny more narrowly than the stars allow me," she
                  added aloud in the startling energetic tone she had before spoken, as she took the
                  visitor's hand in her skinny fingers and intently scanned the lines upon the palm.
                  Then letting it drop, she muttered to herself in a dialect unknown to Seymour, and
                  stood gazing vacantly before her, apparently heedless of his presence.</p>
               <p>Seymour felt his flesh creep as he gazed upon her; and fearful that he would lose
                  command of himself if he gave way to the feelings of superstition that were
                  growing upon him, he resolved again to address her. He repeated his question:</p>
               <p>"What if I have come hither for the purpose of which you spake?" said he.</p>
               <p>"Nothing but this," answered the old woman, whom the sound of her visitor's voice
                  seemed to have aroused from her reverie—"nothing but this, that your visit has
                  been made in vain. I seek not to injure the harmless dove whom the falcon has
                  enticed to his nest. Fear no harm to your bride through me; but know this, that
                  were I inclined to do her evil not all your power could prevent me. Man, you are
                  doomed. You stand on the verge of a precipice, and one false step will imperil
                  your life. You should live long on earth, signor, for—" and she approached her
                  lips close to Seymour's ear, and hastily whispered, "you know that hell is an
                  eternity of anguish and horror. Go," she continued aloud, "go home to your bride.
                  You are about to leave her; fear not that harm will happen to her while you are
                  absent. There are those watching over her more powerful than you to protect her
                  from evil; once again you will revisit her, and then—but the fates forbid me to
                  say what then—my tongue is tied. Go, signor, go; your bride awaits you at your
                  cottage. Leave Marca to her solitude, and fear not for Bedita."</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Bedita!</emph> the name sounded familiarly to the ears of Seymour. Suddenly
                  the thought flashed through his mind, "Bedita was the name that the woman of whom
                  I purchased Zuleika gave to her—and <emph>she</emph> was called Zoe—can this be
                  she? No, impossible, Zoe was at that time a young woman herself, and that was but
                  ten or twelve years ago, while this woman, Marca, must have<pb n="258-259"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000135"/> numbered seventy years at least; besides Zoe was
                  handsome—a model of savage beauty—yet I will know more."</p>
               <p>The superstitious fears that had, during the interview with Marca, held him in
                  thraldom, vanished, now that the reaction had taken place. He resolved, at all
                  hazards, to satisfy himself with regard to this fresh doubt that had arisen in his
                  mind, and he entered the hut into which Marca had entered, after she bade him
                  return to his bride. But it was untenanted. It consisted of one simple room,
                  almost destitute of furniture, save a rude couch and a piece of hewn timber which
                  served for a chair. He rushed again into the open air; he sought the covert of the
                  woods, but in vain; Marca was not to be found; and after spending half an hour in
                  vain search, he returned to the boat, and going on board the felucca, returned to
                  Zuleika's Isle. He met Zuleika and Jane Miller on the beach; they had seen the
                  approach of the felucca, and had come to meet him.</p>
               <p>"Whither have you been this morning, wanderer?" playfully asked Zuleika.</p>
               <p>"To Lemnos, darling," replied Seymour. "I have been to see that old woman who has
                  two or three times terrified you so much. It is as I said; she is a poor, simple,
                  imbecile creature; you must not be so silly as to be alarmed when she comes
                  here."</p>
               <p>"I dare say it is mere folly on my part," returned Zuleika; "I shall not be
                  frightened of her in future."</p>
               <p>Seymour's mind misgave him while he spoke. Yet he had the ancient sibyl's pledge
                  that she intended no harm to his bride, and he was sufficiently superstitious to
                  believe that a pledge thus given by a woman such as she, would be scrupulously
                  observed.</p>
               <p>"But I have strange news to tell," said Zuleika. "While you have been absent, a
                  party of fishermen and women landed from a boat from one of the islands near here,
                  and amongst them there was a tall, handsome woman, who regarded me very earnestly.
                  Her black eyes looked as though they would pierce me through, so intense was their
                  gaze. I thought I had seen her face before; even her tall, upright form seemed
                  familiar to me. Yet, where I had seen her, I could not tell. Strange
                  recollections—events that I have long forgotten, or only remembered as though they
                  had passed before me in a dream, appeared to revive—and then the thought passed
                  through my mind that this strange woman was Zoe—the woman who, when a child, I
                  believed to have been my mother. I had no reason to love her; but I felt as though
                  I must rush into her arms, and beg her to disclose the mystery that surrounds my
                  birth; but she had mingled with the crowd, and I did not see her again."</p>
               <p>"Mere fancy, darling," said Seymour; but he did not feel satisfied with what he
                  had heard. It seemed as if some mysterious fate were gathering its folds around
                  him, and he felt a strange fear that he should find himself irretrievably
                  entangled in its meshes. He strove, however, to shake off the alarm he really
                  felt, and resolved to hasten his departure from the island, determined that this
                  should be the last time that he would leave Zuleika behind him. Nay, he resolved
                  in his own mind to make this his last voyage, and on his return to renounce his
                  wandering life, and, with the wealth he had amassed, to live happily and
                  peacefully on shore.</p>
               <p>His arrangements were completed in the course of a few days more; and now the day
                  arrived for his departure. He and Zuleika were taking their last morning walk
                  along the sea shore.</p>
               <p>"How long will you be absent, George?" asked Zuleika.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps four or five months, dear," replied Seymour.</p>
               <p>"It grieves me that you should be obliged to leave me now, for you know, George,
                  what will, in all probability, occur before you come back," and the fair girl
                  blushed as she spoke.</p>
               <p>"I guess what you allude to, darling," answered Seymour. "I shall have a pledge of
                  our mutual love, a bouncing boy or perhaps a miniature copy of your own dear self,
                  to welcome on my return," and he stooped his head and kissed the blushing girl.
                  "Well," he added, "if it be a boy I suppose I must leave his name to your choice;
                  but, if it be a girl, darling, you must call her Zuleika. Keep up your spirits,
                  dear. Julia will be a faithful attendant, and when I return, recollect, we shall
                  not part again while we live. We shall be very happy, Zuleika."</p>
               <p>"I hope so George. I shall always be happy in the knowledge of your love."</p>
               <p>This last remark was uttered by Zuleika in a tone of hopeful anticipation, and yet
                  there was a tremor in her voice, and an expression of anxiety in her countenance
                  strangely at variance with her usual light and joyous mood. It was noticed by
                  Seymour.</p>
               <p>"You are melancholy, darling," he said, "you must not take my present parting so
                  much to heart, you must shake off<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7191-00000136"/> these
                  low spirits, and strive to be cheerful. Think how soon five months will pass away,
                  and think of our happy re-union then."</p>
               <p>"I will try to do so, George; still I wish that you were not going to leave me
                  now."</p>
               <p>They returned to the cottage, and the remainder of the day was spent in making
                  such arrangements as Seymour thought would be necessary during his absence, for
                  the comfort of his wife.</p>
               <p>On the following morning he took a tender farewell of Zuleika; told Harry to be a
                  cheerful companion to her, and promised her attendant—the old negro woman from
                  Annabon, who was devotedly attached to her mistress—that he would abundantly
                  reward her on his return, if she served Zuleika well and faithfully; and then,
                  stepping into the boat that was to convey him to the felucca, he soon reached the
                  little craft; her lateen sails were loosed to the breeze, the anchor weighed, and
                  Seymour standing on the raised quarter deck, waved his cap as a parting salute.
                  Zuleika was weeping on the shore, and Jane Miller was standing by her side
                  endeavoring to cheer and comfort her with words of happy anticipation.</p>
               <p>A crowd of fishermen and women had assembled to see the felucca get under weigh.
                  Was it fancy, or was it indeed the tall, slender form of the ancient sibyl, Marca,
                  who stood conspicuous amongst that crowd of women and raised her hand and pointed
                  her long skinny fingers toward the felucca, whether in menace or in warning;
                  Seymour was unable to tell; but again his superstitious fears came over him and he
                  turned away his head, and, in a hurried voice, gave some orders to the Greek
                  seamen.</p>
               <p>In another hour Zuleika's Isle had nearly disappeared from the sight of those on
                  the felucca's deck, and the little craft was speeding swiftly before a fair breeze
                  on her voyage to Valetta.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Return of Charlotte Herbert, and her Introduction into Mr. Wilson's
                     Family—What arises therefrom.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>CHARLOTTE HERBERT arrived safely in New Orleans, after a prosperous voyage across
                  the Atlantic from Sierra Leone. She scarcely knew what her intentions were when
                  she landed on the levee. She had no money in her possession beyond a small sum
                  which Captain P——, aware that having been saved from shipwreck, she must
                  necessarily be in a destitute condition, had delicately placed at her disposal,
                  when he bade her farewell at Sierra Leone. She had accepted this thankfully as a
                  loan, to be repaid at her earliest convenience; but she had never told the captain
                  anything relating to her history, and he was not aware that the small sum he had
                  lent her was all that she possessed to save her from utter destitution. He
                  naturally imagined that she had friends in New Orleans, or, at all events, in the
                  State of Louisiana, and the money he had lent her, he thought, would be sufficient
                  to carry her to them, or to support her in New Orleans until she could hear from
                  them; but, unfortunately, it was her all, and she arrived in her native country,
                  after her long absence, in the condition of an emigrant who has no friends, and
                  who has to work his own way into some means of support. Charlotte had friends in
                  the United States, it is true, but she was distant from them, and she did not wish
                  to make herself known to them. She almost hoped that they thought her dead, and
                  had long since forgotten her. She was, however, a well educated young woman, of
                  interesting personal appearance, and she, fortunately, soon after her arrival,
                  read in the <title>Picayune,</title> an advertisement asking for the services of a
                  young lady to occupy the post of governess in the family of a gentleman who held
                  the position of guardian to two of his brother's children—two girls, aged
                  respectively twelve and sixteen years. Happily for her, her manners and appearance
                  enabled her to obtain the situation, without any other than verbal inquiry being
                  made as to her ability and the respectability of her family, and she entered upon
                  her duties still preserving her incognita. The Misses Wilson, the two young ladies
                  who were placed under her charge, were amiable and beautiful girls; but, although
                  they were sisters, they did not bear the slightest resemblance to each other.
                  Marie, the elder, was a tall, pale, dark-haired, black-eyed girl, possessed of
                  features of classical regularity, and with a sweet and gentle expression of
                  countenance, although, when at rest, a tinge of melancholy seemed habitually to
                  overshadow it. She moved with the grace of a queen; and although she was naturally
                  reserved and shrunk from observation, her beauty grew around her a host of
                  admirers, to none of whom she appeared to show any marked preference. The beauty
                  of Louise, the younger sister,<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7191-00000137"/> was a
                  perfect antithesis to that of Marie. She was small of her age, joyous in
                  temperament, impulsive, and quick to take affront, but as quickly appeased, and
                  slight and agile as a fairy. Her complexion was delicately fair, her hair light
                  auburn, her eyes blue, and the ruddy flush of health and spirits was called to her
                  cheeks by every passing emotion. Mr. Wilson, the uncle of the girls, was a planter
                  of considerable wealth. He was, however, a man of cold, calculating disposition;
                  and although he fulfilled to the letter that which he considered to be his duty
                  towards his fair wards, he seldom mingled in their amusements, or seemed to take
                  any interest in their studies, beyond asking their young governess, at stated
                  seasons, how they got along.</p>
               <p>Miss Herbert was not long in perceiving that some deep-seated sorrow was preying
                  on the mind of the elder of her pupils. Two or three times, entering suddenly and
                  unexpectedly into her apartment, she had found her in tears, which she in vain
                  sought to hide, or even to restrain; but, although the young girl was evidently
                  fond of her, she never would explain the cause of these tears, and firmly resisted
                  every effort made by Miss Herbert to induce her to confide to her the cause of her
                  distress.</p>
               <p>A month or two passed away, however, and although Miss Herbert herself was often
                  the subject of melancholy reflections, the cause of which the reader may have
                  surmised, she was as happy and comfortable in her situation as she could well
                  expect to be.</p>
               <p>On her arrival at New Orleans she had placed in the post-office the letters and
                  parcels entrusted to her charge by young Miller; and Mrs. Miller had in due time
                  received the letters. About the same time, however, she received a letter from her
                  boy, direct from Sierra Leone, in which he alluded to the singular story of the
                  White lady of Annabon, and related to his mother the history of the letter and the
                  ring, asserting boldly that he was confident that the ring she had worn on her
                  finger on the day he left home, and which she prized so highly in consequence of
                  its being, as she supposed, a memento of her lost daughter, had been in his
                  possession for several weeks, and had disappeared even more strangely than it had
                  come into his possession. He concluded by asking his mother, seriously, whether,
                  during the period he had been absent, she had at any time missed the ring.</p>
               <p>The worthy widow knew not what to make of this epistle. The ring he spoke of she
                  had constantly worn; never for a single moment had it been absent from her finger,
                  even while she was sleeping; besides, the idea was preposterous. The poor woman
                  became alarmed. She had heard of the deleterious effects of the African climate,
                  and she naturally enough came to the conclusion that the boy must be suffering
                  under some derangement of the brain, and that the whole story he told was a mental
                  delusion.</p>
               <p>She showed the letter to Mr. Mordant, who told her that he had heard of the island
                  recluse from his nephew, and that as he was about writing to Sierra Leone himself,
                  if she would leave the letter for him to read, he would make such inquiries of his
                  agent as should induce him to see the boy, if the ship still remained in the
                  harbor, or should again visit that part of the coast. He agreed with her that the
                  boy must be laboring under some extraordinary delusion. "But," he added, "my dear
                  Mrs. Miller, some strange mania appears to have seized all my correspondents there
                  just now. I have just heard from one of my sea-captains, who has taken some mad
                  freak into his head, and gone I know not whither, leaving the vessel to shift for
                  itself. (The widow had called at Mr. Mordant's office in town on the day he had
                  received Captain Seymour's letter, announcing his intention to quit the Albatross
                  for a time, and on the very day the evening of which had been productive—as the
                  reader is aware—of such a complication of annoyances.) The letter was left at the
                  office, and having been mislaid by Mr. Mordant, was found and perused by his son,
                  and subsequently became the occasion of some singular misadventures. This,
                  however, was not the only difficulty that arose out of the abstraction of the ring
                  from young Miller's chest, by Miss Herbert, under the impression that it was her
                  own. She had frequently worn it during the voyage home, though she had reasons for
                  not doing so on board the man-of-war, and had never thought of looking into the
                  little drawer in her trunk where her own ring had been placed, until some time
                  after her arrival at New Orleans, when she came upon it accidentally, and was
                  perfectly bewildered with amazement on finding herself in possession of two rings
                  exactly <foreign xml:lang="LAT">fac similes</foreign> of each other. She puzzled
                  her brains for some time, endeavoring to account for the strange discovery, but
                  failing to do so, she carefully laid one of the rings aside, trusting that time
                  would explain the apparent mystery.</p>
               <p>We will now return to Mr. Wilson and his two nieces.<pb n="264-265"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000138"/> About two months after the first connection of Miss
                  Herbert with the family, she was sent for into Mr. Wilson's study.</p>
               <p>"I have sent for you, Miss Herbert," said he, after he had invited her to be
                  seated, "to inform you that my elder niece, Miss Marie, will soon be released from
                  your charge. She is shortly to be married to a young gentleman of good family and
                  excellent expectations, in New York. I am well satisfied with your conduct since
                  you have been in the family, and you will continue to superintend the education of
                  my youngest niece at the same salary that I have hitherto paid you. I wish you,
                  however, to see Miss Marie, and to reason with her upon her folly in objecting to
                  the marriage. I propose for her. She knows that my heart is set upon it, and it is
                  her <emph>duty</emph> to obey me, and her <emph>interest</emph> as well." He
                  pronounced the two words duty and interest, so emphatically, that Miss Herbert
                  could not help noticing it; but knowing the planter's stern nature, she thought
                  less of it than she might otherwise have done.</p>
               <p>She replied:</p>
               <p>"I will See her as you desire, sir; I have been painted to notice the mental
                  anxiety under which your elder ward appears to labor. She has never confided the
                  cause of it to me; but I presume, that what you have just related tome will
                  explain it."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it will, Miss Herbert. At all events, see Marie, and endeavor to reason
                  her into a proper frame of mind, and warn her, from me, to beware how she risks
                  the utter ruin of all her future prospects in life."</p>
               <p>Miss Herbert quitted the presence of her imperious employer, and immediately
                  sought the chamber of her pupil. She had not expressed her sentiments in the
                  presence of Mr. Wilson, but she sincerely pitied the girl, and she resolved, if
                  matters were as she suspected, that her influence should not be exerted to secure
                  her pupil's life-long wretchedness—for life-long wretchedness she felt would
                  result from a forced union on the part of Marie with a man whom she did not love,
                  whom she perhaps hated and despised.</p>
               <p>Marie Wilson was sitting in her room by the open window, disconsolately reading a
                  note that her guardian had just sent her. She started and thrust it in her bosom
                  when Miss Herbert entered.</p>
               <p>"I am sent here, my dear Marie, by your uncle and guardian, Mr. Wilson. He has
                  told me of his intentions regarding you, and has desired me to express to you my
                  opinion that it is your duty not to oppose his wishes; far be it from me, however
                  ever, to advise you to adopt a course which must result your lasting unhappiness.
                  I suspect that the intelligence I have just heard has been the cause of the
                  despondency which I have so frequently observed you to be afflicted with, though
                  you have never made me your confidant. Is it so? Is this marriage upon which your
                  uncle seems so determined, so distasteful to you? If so, I counsel you to refuse
                  to obey him in this respect, or at least to temporize with him In a few years more
                  you will be of age, and free from his guardianship—I believe you have property in
                  your own right—and then you can please yourself as regards one of the most
                  important actions of woman's life."</p>
               <p>The tears were falling fast from the eyes of Marie ere Miss Herbert had done
                  speaking. As soon as she could control her emotion, she said:</p>
               <p>"It is as you suspected, Miss Herbert. Hitherto I have kept the secret of my grief
                  locked up in my own bosom. It is now twelve months since I first met the man who
                  desires to marry me, and who has gained over Mr. Wilson to advocate his cause—nay,
                  more—to insist upon this sacrifice on my part. He was then on a visit to New
                  Orleans, and although I do not know the particulars of the case, I believe that
                  Mr. Wilson is involved in debt to his father who is a merchant of great wealth in
                  New York. He sought my hand then, and was by me refused, for his character was
                  bad; I heard sad stories respecting him, besides, I cannot give my hand without my
                  heart goes with it. But he was not to be thus repulsed. He sought Mr. Wilson and
                  asked him to give him my hand in marriage. I believe some infamous covenant
                  entered into between them; but though I suspect, I do not entirely know its
                  nature. It is enough that I must obey—must marry a man I cannot love—must break my
                  plighted word to another—or—I shudder to contemplate my probable fate." Again the
                  unhappy girl burst into a paroxysm of grief.</p>
               <p>"My dear Marie," said Miss Herbert, endeavoring to console the weeping girl, "your
                  guardian cannot compel you to this marriage. You overrate the power his trust
                  reposes in him. You can do as I advise you; plead your youth, refuse to marry at
                  present, and when you become of age please yourself as to your choice of a
                  husband."</p>
               <p>"Alas! Miss Herbert, you know not all my sad history. You know not the humiliation
                  to which I am exposed. You think me the niece of Mr. Wilson and the sister of
                  Louise; so<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7191-00000139"/> in one sense I am; but the
                  mother of Louise was not my mother. I am the daughter—why should I blush to own
                  it—I am the daughter of a favorite quadroon slave who belonged to Mr. Wilson's
                  wife, and who died shortly after her mistress. It is only since I have been urged
                  to marry Charles Mordant that I have been told this—I am the property, body and
                  soul, of my guardian, as the world believes him to be, so at least he says; and he
                  threatens—yes, even in this letter he has sent me to-day, which I was reading when
                  you entered—he threatens, unless I consent immediately to follow his wishes, to
                  declare my parentage to the world, and to dispose of me <emph>as his</emph>
                  slave—so he has the cruelty to tell me—to the highest bidder. Oh! God, to what a
                  state of wretchedness am I reduced."</p>
               <p>At the name of Charles Mordant, Miss Herbert had started and turned pale. For some
                  time she could not trust herself to speak; but with a violent effort she subdued
                  her emotion, and said in a husky voice which, had Marie not been suffering "woes
                  all her own," she must have noticed.</p>
               <p>"But when Mr. Wilson's brother, your father, died, did he not leave you any
                  property? Are you sure he did not during his life-time purchase your freedom?"</p>
               <p>"I know not. He died suddenly. He was as fond of me as he was of my sister Louise,
                  the daughter of his wife whom he married, I am told, about a year after I was
                  born. Louise's mother, whom I always supposed to be my mother likewise, treated me
                  as though I were her own daughter; and we were led to suppose by our father, I and
                  Louise, that his large property was to be divided between us in equal portions.
                  Now, my uncle tells me my father left no will, and Louise is his only heiress, and
                  that I am subject entirely to his will and pleasure. He says if I consent to marry
                  Charles Mordant, I shall have my share; otherwise——, I cannot say what he
                  threatened me with otherwise. It is too dreadful a fate."</p>
               <p>"Poor child," said Miss Herbert, "I could not have thought such iniquity existed
                  on this earth; but, Marie, I can save you from this dreaded fate—at" least from
                  marriage with Charles Mordant. <emph>He is my husband!</emph> He gained my
                  affections when an artless, unsuspecting girl. Not long ago," she added, smiling
                  mournfully—"but it appears to me that I have grown prematurely aged—he gained his
                  ends by going through the ceremony of what he thought was a false marriage. I
                  sometime, afterwards, when he taunted me with it, thought so too, and was almost
                  driven to insanity. I fled to New Orleans, and after subsisting on the sale of my
                  jewels for some time, I engaged as stewardess, heedless almost what became of me,
                  on board a vessel bound to Liverpool; the vessel was wrecked, but my life was
                  saved. However, that is nothing to the purpose now. After my return to New
                  Orleans, and not more than a month ago, I met the man who had played me false,
                  pretending to have been a Baptist clergyman. I recognized, and would have avoided
                  him. He was accompanied by another person, whom I also recognized as having been
                  present at the ceremony. They stopped me. It was in a lonely place, and I could
                  not escape them; but they told me they wished me no harm; on the contrary, what
                  they had to say would be to my benefit. I was compelled to listen. Then they told
                  me that Mr. Mordant had persuaded a young man, not the one who married us, but he
                  who was present with him, to personate a clergyman on the occasion of what I
                  thought was to be our wedding, and thus cruelly to deceive me; but, though a
                  pretended friend, this man was a secret enemy of Charles, who had treated him with
                  contempt and scorn in the presence of some of his aristocratic companions. He
                  therefore sought revenge by procuring the assistance of another person—a
                  magistrate, though I fear me hie was an unworthy one, to sign the contract; and on
                  the evening when the disgraceful and cruel trick was to be played, Charles's
                  friend pretended sickness, and the entire ceremony was performed by the other;
                  since then the breach between these two men and Charles Mordant has widened. They
                  would now willingly do anything to injure his future prospects, and they wished me
                  to unite with them in exposing him. I refused. I scarcely knew what to do or how
                  to act. But I am now decided. Dear Marie, my name is not Charlotte Herbert, but
                  Jeanette Dixon, and Mr. Wilson cannot forte this hateful marriage upon you—for, as
                  I said before, Charles Mordant is my husband; and, thank God! when I was cast
                  adrift upon the ocean, the written contract which proves my marriage, was saved; I
                  kept it in a purse which I wore suspended from my neck. It was damaged by the
                  water, but it is still legible."</p>
               <p>She drew a purse from her pocket, and took thence a torn and stained paper—almost
                  rotten, and ready to fall into fragments; but the marriage contract of Charles
                  Mordant and Jeanette Dixon, legally attested and signed by a magistrate, in the
                  presence of witnesses, was distinctly legible.</p>
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7191-00000140"/>
               <p>"Thank God! I am saved," exclaimed Marie, throwing her arms around Jeanette
                  Dixon's neck.</p>

                  <p>An Essay on Familiarity with Death—Captain James is Rewarded for his Kindness
                     to the <hi rend="i"/>Yunga Jagos Negress.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHO, that has visited Sierra Leone (the Land of Lions), the capital of Her
                  Britannic Majesty's possessions in Western Africa, would think, as, newly arrived
                  from the calm monotonous seas of the tropics, he gazes with admiration and delight
                  upon the brilliant scenery of the coast upon which this capital is situated, that
                  the soil, laden with vegetable wealth of the richest and most gorgeous
                  description, was pregnant with the seeds of a malaria that is almost always fatal
                  to the health of the European residents? Who would think that the atmosphere,
                  redolent with aromatic perfume, was filled with minute globules of poisonous
                  vapor, which, to inhale, is to sow the seeds of disease and death? Who that lands
                  on that shore, and promenades the clean, well laid out, and elevated streets,
                  lined with villas surrounded with balconies, rendered gay and pleasing to the eye,
                  in consequence of their light and tasteful structure; the cleanliness of their
                  white walls and the neatness of the broad green jalousies, which serve instead of
                  glass windows in this sultry clime, prettily as they stand amongst the gaily
                  arranged gardens and shrubberies. Who would think that these light and fairy-like
                  structures were so often the domicils of disease and death? and that at certain
                  seasons of the year, beautiful as they appear without, they are changed; to lazar
                  houses within, while the families who inhabit them, rapidly, one after another,
                  pass from these beautiful and luxurious abodes to the dark earthen Avails of the
                  narrow tomb!</p>
               <p>High above the town, situated on the summit of a steep hill—located there for the
                  purpose of ensuring, to the residents a bountiful supply of the purest air that
                  can be obtained, although it is a question whether the boon is not too dearly
                  earned by the toil (in this hot climate) that it requires to reach the
                  heights—stand the barracks and the hospital—the former often scantily tenanted;
                  the wards of the latter, notwithstanding withstanding its inmates rapidly pass
                  from it, generally well filled; the ranks of invalids, however fast they may be
                  thinned by death, being quickly recruited by fresh candidates for admission.</p>
               <p>Yet, it is a strange fact, that the more man witnesses of disease and death—the
                  more he is exposed to either—the less he thinks of them—the more careless and
                  reckless he becomes—the less he grieves for the loss of those he claims as his
                  friends. He becomes a believer in the doctrine of manifest destiny; and, if he or
                  his friends are to die, so it must be he says; it is useless to try to avert the
                  doom; it is cowardly to fear it, and childish to give way to useless grief.</p>
               <p>This feeling is apparent as well on the battle-field, and on the deck of the ship
                  in an engagement, as when exposed to the malarious influences of an unhealthy
                  climate. It is no uncommon thing to see an officer rise suddenly from the
                  mess-table—where, perhaps, ten minutes before he had been entertaining his
                  comrades with some pleasant jest, though, perchance, an oft-repeated tale, or has
                  joined loudest in the mirth occasioned by the jest of one of his neighbors—and,
                  with pallid features, quit the room, and seek his own apartment—and the cause is
                  well known; a negro attendant may follow his master from the mess-room, but not
                  one of his <emph>friends</emph> think it necessary to inquire what is the matter.
                  Perhaps the exit of the stricken one is unheeded—perchance it calls forth the
                  quiet though pointed remark, "So —— is in for Yellow Jack." The chances are two to
                  one that the victim of the yellow fever never rejoins that mess-table; still the
                  jest passes round with the bottle, and sentiments are given and toasts proposed,
                  and even disease and death are made a joke of; and, with reckless bravado, some
                  incipient hero drinks to "Rapid promotion and a sickly season." Promotion through
                  the death of his comrade! Still, there is no evil aforethought in this—no malice.
                  'Tis but the callousness that, as we have asserted, is ever produced in the human
                  heart by familiarity with strife and bloodshed, or with disease and death.</p>
               <p>A week or two after the conversation recorded in a preceding chapter, that had
                  taken place between the directing physician of the hospital and the captains of
                  the Buzzard and the G——, these three gentlemen were seated at dinner at the
                  officers' mess-room table in the Sierra Leone barracks. Both the sailors were to
                  take their departure on the following day,<pb n="270-271"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000141"/> and they had been invited to a farewell dinner with
                  the officers of the garrison.</p>
               <p>"By-the-by, Peterson," said Captain James, of the Buzzard, "you were relating to
                  me and my friend, Captain P——, a rather romantic story, in connection with the two
                  negro babies we went to see in the nurse's ward at the hospital. Was it merely a
                  creation of your own imagination, or was the scene you anticipated realized?"</p>
               <p>"Realized to the letter, my dear fellow," replied the doctor. "As I told you, I
                  sent for the woman, and she proved to be the mother of the two children. It does a
                  man good, occasionally, to witness a scene such as that which occurred at the
                  hospital on the day the woman was brought in. She did not know why she was brought
                  back, and was a little frightened, poor thing; but I had her led into the ward
                  where the children were sleeping. I never saw such little devils as they are for
                  sleeping in my life—no wonder they get so fat. However, when she came in, led by
                  one of the matrons, looking about her with a wild stare, as if she was watching an
                  opportunity to cut and run from the custody of the nurse, I pinched one of the
                  young ones in the ear, and of course the little d—I set up a squall. That was what
                  I wanted. I told you, you recollect, that it was said the mother of the children
                  had recognized the wail of her infants while they were being conveyed on board the
                  slaver, Whence you took them—and I had a mind to see whether the cry of these
                  infants would have the same effect with this <hi rend="i"/>Yunga Jagos woman. By
                  George! sir, you should have seen her when she heard the squall. She stood still
                  as a statue—her head inclining a little to one side, and the forefinger of her
                  right hand raised in an attitude of earnest attention. I pinched the ear of the
                  other infant, and they set up a most unmelodious duet. But the negro wench heard
                  whence the sound proceeded. In a moment she was by the side of the crib, and in
                  another moment the two children were in her arms, squealing like young porkers,
                  though their cries were stifled by the smothering caresses of the mother, who was
                  perfectly frantic with joy. She skipped and danced about the room, still holding
                  the children in her arms, tightly clasped to her bosom, until I thought she would
                  go crazy. Suddenly she sprang to the crib, laid the children down, and then
                  rushing to me, flung herself at my feet, and clinging to my legs, showed the most
                  unequivocal and affecting signs of gratitude. Then she sprang up, and I verily
                  believe was about to caress me after the same fashion as she had caressed the
                  children. But I bolted. I by no means wished to experience a public embrace from a
                  negress, though she <emph>is</emph> deuced good looking; besides, I was a little
                  affected myself. I will own up to it. But, Captain James; I had almost forgotten
                  to say that I disclaimed the pleasure of having been the occasion of the
                  restoration of her children, and with some difficulty made her understand that a
                  stranger (meaning you) was the person to whom her gratitude was due, and promised
                  to introduce her to you. It is well thought of, Sambo," turning to a negro
                  attendant, "tell Juba that I want her. I have called Her Juba, Captain," again
                  addressing the sea officer, "and intended to keep her in my family for the
                  present. But what ails you?"</p>
               <p>Captain James had turned pale and risen from his chair. "I feel strangely unwell,"
                  he said; "a sensation of sickness has come over me, all in a moment, such as I
                  never experienced before." He did not trust himself to say more, but hastily
                  quitted the room—the party assembled looked gravely and knowingly around the table
                  at each other.</p>
               <p>"A decided case of Yellow Jack," said a young ensign, at the lower end of the
                  table. "Captain James is booked, and there's a chance for young Stringer, his
                  first lieutenant, to get an acting appointment to carry the ship home. Stringer's
                  in luck. He was only telling me yesterday that he hoped to obtain a commander's
                  commission when he got home. I fancy he'll earn the silver anchor to his
                  epaulettes sooner than he anticipated."</p>
               <p>This thoughtless, unfeeling speech was little heeded by the rest of the party.
                  Doctor Peterson and Captain P—— followed the captain of the Buzzard out of the
                  mess-room, and in a few minutes the joke and the jest, and the wine bottle, passed
                  around amongst the other guests as if nothing of so serious a character had
                  occurred to mar their festivity.</p>
               <p>Ere two hours had elapsed, Captain James lay in a cot in one of the wards of the
                  hospital, delirious with fever. His disease was the most virulent description of
                  the fatal yellow fever—and Doctor Peterson had given up all hope of his ultimate
                  recovery; for in this climate the disease speeds its course with a rapidity
                  elsewhere unknown, and a few hours' space often sees the victim—in the apparent
                  possession of perfect health—a fevered maniac and a cold and repulsive corpse. A
                  few hours more, and be is consigned to the grave.</p>
               <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7191-00000142"/>
               <p>But Juba—as Dr. Peterson had termed her—had hastily and gladly responded to the
                  summons that called her to see the rescuer of her offspring. She came, to find him
                  gone, from the festive board to the sick couch—a victim to the dreadful and fatal
                  disease of the climate. She asked to see him, but was denied. Doctor Peterson
                  would admit no one but the nurses to the sick chamber. The <hi rend="i"/>Yunga
                  Jagos woman was not to be discouraged, not to be repulsed. She asked to see the
                  doctor, and, as well as she was able, in her imperfect English, she conjured him
                  to admit her to the bedside of the fever-stricken victim. She could save him, she
                  said; and so urgent was her appeal, so apparently confident her assertion, that
                  the physician at length yielded to her importunities. He promised her that she
                  should be admitted, though he had little or no faith in the expressed confidence
                  of her curative powers.</p>
               <p>To his astonishment, as soon as she had obtained the inquired permission, she
                  darted out from the door, and sped rapidly away to a dense copse, which lay at
                  about a quarter of a mile distant from the hospital, on the inland declivity of
                  the hill on which the structure was located. She was soon back again, bearing a
                  handful of herbs, of a nature unknown to the doctor, and the virtues of which had
                  never been mentioned in the pharmacopœia. To his inquiry as to what she was going
                  to do with these, she simply replied, "You shall see." She burned them in a tin
                  vessel over the fire—the herbs emitting a singular aromatic and almost stifling
                  perfume, notwithstanding the lid of the vessel was kept tightly closed; and,
                  having thus prepared herself, she entered the room in which lay the victim of the
                  terrible disease. She requested to be alone with her patient for one hour. The
                  doctor, as we have observed, had given up all hope of Captain James's recovery,
                  but he had known strange instances of the skill of the natives in curing diseases
                  incidental to the climate, which had baffled all the skill of regularly trained
                  physicians. The symptoms could be no worse—and the request of the <hi rend="i"
                  />Yunga Jagos woman was granted. For one hour she was closeted with her patient,
                  and Doctor Peterson, whose curiosity had led him to linger at the door and to
                  endeavor to listen to what was going on within, heard strange sounds issuing from
                  the room, and peeping through the key-hole, he saw the negress engaged in
                  incantations and mummeries similar to those employed by the native conjurers, when
                  endeavoring to exorcise disease. He turned away with a sensation of sickness and
                  loathing;—but, at the expiration of the hour, the negress re-appeared. Doctor
                  Peterson was about to enter the room. "Not yet; not yet," signified the negress,
                  placing her fingers to her lips, "He sleeps, and he must not be awakened. While he
                  sleeps I must wait by his couch." She returned with her babes in her arms, and
                  another hour elapsed. The doctor was growing impatient; but just as he was on the
                  point of entering the room—wondering at his own folly in having thus allowed
                  himself to connive in such mummery—the negress again appeared, joy depicted upon
                  her countenance, and beckoned him to follow her. He entered the room, and to his
                  utter amazement beheld his patient, him whom he had lately given over as beyond
                  the possibility of human aid—sitting up in the bed, supported by the pillows—for
                  the weakening nature of the disorder, even in the short time that had elapsed
                  since the attack had commenced had prostrated his strength, and, probably, the
                  active remedies, whatever they were, had still added to his debility: but, he was
                  entirely free from fever, and was looking in mingled doubt and wonder at the woman
                  who was standing by the side of the cot, jabbering away in her native dialect,
                  still holding the infants in her arms, and evidently half wild with delight at the
                  thought of having saved the life of the rescuer of her babes.</p>
               <p>In the course of a day or two the captain had entirely recovered, and was enabled
                  to rejoin his ship. Shortly afterwards he sailed for England—and thus, though it
                  was a mere act of duty and common humanity on the part of the captain—partly the
                  act of chance good fortune, in consequence of his having so opportunely fallen in
                  with the slaver, was this act of humanity rewarded by the grateful mother's
                  preservation of his life when the skill of the leech was utterly at fault.</p>
               <p>The young ensign was mistaken, and Lieutenant Stringer had yet to wait ere he
                  could mount the coveted silver anchors of the commander's rank on his plain gold
                  epaulettes.</p>
               <p>Doctor Peterson vainly sought to learn from Juba the means by which she had
                  effected so magical a cure. The language of the negress was difficult to be
                  understood, but she willingly showed him the herbs she had employed in her
                  mysterious incantations; they were simple creeping parasites, common enough, in
                  the woods, and although, exceedingly aromatic, apparently possessed of no medical
                  virtues. Nor did the grateful negress pretend they were; she did not assert that
                  they could be rendered available, save in peculiar cases. It was, she said, a mark
                  of favor from the great <hi rend="i"/>Obeah, who had, in this<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000143"/> instance, rendered their virtues serviceable, in
                  behalf of him who had restored her children to the arms and the heart of a
                  wretched and despairing mother.<ref rend="super" target="#note_002"
                     xml:id="return_002">*</ref>
                   Juba did not wish to return to her tribe. She had, as we have before
                  recorded, been sold by her husband, who had become satiated with her charms, and
                  had taken to himself another wife in her place. She feared that if she returned,
                  she would again be sold, perhaps into hopeless slavery. She accepted the offer of
                  Captain James, to take her and her children to England with him, and was
                  subquently installed as a favored domestic in his family. Doctor Peterson was
                  unwilling to part with her, but he considered that Captain James had a greater and
                  a prior claim to her than he, and he agreed to the proposition of the former.</p>

                           <p>"'* * * A strange adventure has lately befallen me, dear William. You
                              recollect sending me that beautiful ring, shortly after you removed to
                              Boston. Why did you think it necessary to go there, William? Could you
                              not have completed your legal studies quite as well in Augusta? But I
                              suppose you know best. Perhaps it is better as it, is; but I am
                              forgetting my story. I have always worn that ring since—and mamma has
                              often joked me about it; and a good many of my companions have asked
                              me what I set so much store upon it for. Well, on Monday last as I was
                              going across the meadow that lies at the back of our house—that meadow
                              where we used to wander of an evening, after you came home from the
                              office, during the happy period when I saw you every day—I met a lady,
                              at least so far as appearances go; that is to say, she was respectably
                              attired in black silk, and altogether presented a very decent
                              appearance. I had pulled off my glove to gather a posy of wild
                              flowers, and as this lady was passing me she stopped suddenly, and
                              started, and looked so strange and frightened that I grew rather
                              alarmed. I was about to ask her if she was unwell, when she approached
                              me, and seizing my hand, asked me whence I obtained the ring I wore. I
                              scarcely knew what to say; but I believe I told her it was a gift from
                              a dear friend, and was about to pass on, when she grasped my right arm
                              and commenced some incoherent harangue about her daughter; saying that
                              the ring belonged to her, and that I must have stolen it from her, and
                              she asked me if it had not the letter: engraved on the inside? I said
                              yes, and that the initial stood for my own name—Jessica. However, she
                              grew almost violent in her demeanor, and I don't know what I should
                              have done had not papa come up on his way from the office. The lady
                              commenced assailing him; but he managed to calm her, and bidding me
                              hasten home to mamma, he and this strange woman walked together to our
                              house. They were all the time engaged in earnest conversation; and
                              papa, when he got home, took her up stairs into his study, where they
                              were closeted for a long time. At last she went away, and then papa
                              sent for me, and asked me if you had ever told me how the ring came
                              into your possession. I said you had informed me that you purchased it
                              in Boston; and that was all I knew about it. He said no more; but
                              every day since then, he and this lady, whose name I have never heard,
                              for he never says anything to mamma or me about her, have been
                              closeted together; and whenever I have chanced to meet her, she has
                              given me a most scrutinizing<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7191-00000144"
                              /> tinizing glance, and looked at the ring as though she would like to
                              tear it from my fingers. Now, dear William, if there be any mystery
                              attached to this ring, do tell me about it, for I am dying with
                              anxiety to know the cause of all these singular proceedings. * * * * I
                              am going to the post-office to post this letter to-night, and papa has
                              just placed a letter for you and one for Mr. Ogilvie into my hands,
                              both of which letters he wishes me to post with mine. Perhaps papa's
                              letter to you may explain. If it does, let me know when you write
                              again.</p>

                              boy, and I need not add that your relations with regard to my darling
                              Jessie, cause me to feel still greater interest in your progress, and
                              greater pleasure in your good conduct than I, perhaps, might otherwise
                              do. The letter to Mr. Ogilvie is in allusion to you and your family,
                              especially your sister Sarah. Mr. O. will in all probability shortly
                              enlighten you as to its contents. By-the-by, William, Jessie wears a

                              possession. I have no doubt you obtained it honorably; but there is a
                              mystery of a singular nature connected with it, which interests me
                              exceedingly. My wife desires to be kindly remembered to you, and
                              expressed a hope that you will visit Augusta, during the course of the

                  Deane's letter. "What a confounded fuss about that foolish ring. Where did I get
                  it from? Why I bought it of a jeweller, to be sure, as most people do when they
                  want to send such trinkets to their sweethearts. I wish it had been at the bottom
                  of Boston Bay, though, before there had been this fuss made about it, and that I
                  had purchased something else for Jessie——"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Ogilvie wishes to see you in the library, sir," said a servant, opening the

               <p>"Now I hope I shall have the mystery explained," said the young man to himself as
                  he descended to the library.</p>
               <p>"Take a seat, William," said Mr. Ogilvie, as the young man entered. "I wish to
                  have a little conversation with you with regard to a communication I have just
                  received from your former friend, Mr. Deane, of Augusta. I have never heard
                  anything respecting your family or relatives; but if you have no objection, it is
                  necessary that I should now receive some information of that kind. Who was your
                  father, William?"</p>
               <p>"An officer in the United States army, sir," said the young man, proudly.</p>
               <p>"Ah, I recollect; Mr. Deane said something of that kind when you came here first;
                  but you had a grandfather, I presume," added Mr. Ogilvie, smilingly. "Who and what
                  was he?"</p>
               <p>"He was an Englishman, and in his youth he held a commission in the British army,
                  I believe; but he came while still young to the United States, became a, citizen,
                  and purchased a farm near Camden (Me.), on which my father resided after he had
                  quitted the service; there I was born, and there my mother still resides."</p>
               <p>"Humph! have you ever heard your mother mention anything about having wealthy
                  relatives in England?"</p>
               <p>"I have heard her say something to that purport, but I have paid little attention
                  to it."</p>
               <p>"Your mother is an Englishwoman, I believe?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; but she came to America with her parents when a child."</p>
               <p>"What was her name previously to her marriage—that is, what is the surname of her

               <p>Mr. Ogilvie looked at a letter he held in his hand. "You have a sister?" he
                  continued.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"And her name?"</p>
               <p>"Is Sarah Donaldson Martin."</p>
               <p>"So far so good. Mr. Deane writes me to say that he has lately made the
                  acquaintance of a lady in Augusta, who has for some time past resided in a state
                  of great seclusion in that city, although she is reputed to be possessed of
                  considerable property. Her name is Sarah Donaldson; she is a maiden lady,
                  considerably advanced in years. This lady came, it appears, to the United States
                  on a tour of pleasure, being partially actuated to do so, in the hope of
                  discovering a niece, named after herself, who had, she learnt, married an officer
                  of the United States Army, but of whose fortunes she had heard but little, as she
                  had come to this country when an infant, with her parents, both of whom died while
                  she was yet a mere girl. Mrs. Donaldson, notwithstanding she is a maiden lady,
                  assumes the title of matronhood, and she was accompanied hither by a younger
                  brother, a widower, and his daughter, whom she had brought up from a child, and to
                  whom she was devotedly attached. Shortly after their arrival in Boston, they
                  called at a jeweller's store in that city, and ordered a ring to be manufactured
                  for the young lady who accompanied them. It appears that a ring of singular
                  construction, belonging to the young lady's mother, whose name was Jemima, had
                  been accidentally lost overboard on the passage from England. Their object was to
                  obtain one of exactly similar pattern for the young lady to wear. It was
                  purchased, and shortly afterwards the party left Boston for New York. Mrs.
                  Donaldson, being in rather feeble health, remained in the city, while her brother
                  and his child proceeded on a tour up the Hudson, with the intention of visiting
                  the northern and western part of the State. They were never again heard of; for,
                  not returning at the time they were expected, the anxiety suffered by Mrs.
                  Donaldson slightly affected her intellect, awl probably the inquiries respecting
                  them, that would otherwise have been instituted, were not made. Mrs. Donaldson,
                  however, on her partial recovery—though I believe to this day she is not exactly
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">compos mentis,</foreign> if my friend Deane judges
                  correctly—removed to Augusta, having heard that her niece resided somewhere in the
                  State of Maine, with the intention, no doubt, of still further prosecuting her
                  inquiries respecting her; but with an inconsistency frequently found in people in
                  her unhappy condition, when she reached Augusta her energies failed her, and she
                  has ever since lived the life of a recluse in that city. A short time since she,
                  by chance, met with Mr. Deane's daughter, and her attention was accidentally drawn
                  to a ring which the young lady wore upon her finger, which she asserted, and still
                  asserts, is the identical ring that she had made in Boston. She has since that
                  period had several interviews with Mr. Deane, who has obtained this information
                  from her, and who was in the first instance struck with the name of Donaldson,
                  when the lady observed that she had a niece of that name residing in Maine, if she
                  were, indeed, still living, who had married an American officer of the name of
                  Martin. Mr. Deane, it appears, had heard or fancied he had heard that Donaldson
                  was your mother's maiden name. Mrs. Donaldson, whose health is rapidly declining,
                  and who cannot last long, has expressed her intention of leaving her property to
                  her grand niece, subject to the mother's control, until the girl be of sufficient
                  age to take care of it herself—provided the child has been christened by the
                  family name of Donaldson. It seems she heard by some means or other that such was
                  the case before she left England; though, Mr. Deane says, she talks so
                  incoherently in this matter that it is difficult to make out her meaning. Failing
                  the discovery of her niece, the property will be left to the heirs of a family
                  named Seymour, with which the Donaldsons seem to have been related or in some way
                  connected. This is all that Deane explains at present; but you see, now, William,
                  the necessity of your giving such information as you are able with regard to the
                  ring, which has led to this <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                  >éclaircissement.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, sir," said the young man, "I know nothing more of the ring than
                  this: I went into the store of Mr. ——, in this city, some time since, and
                  purchased a singular looking, antique ring, inside of which I had the letter:
                  engraved, and then I sent the ring as a present to Miss Jessica Deane."</p>
               <p>"In that case I will call upon the jeweller," replied Mr. Ogilvie. "Perhaps he may
                  afford us some further information with regard to this matter. It is worth some
                  little investigation, for there is a great probability that in the event of
                  matters being properly explained, your family will benefit from the wealth of this
                  old lady. Let me see; how many brothers have you?"</p>
               <p>"One only—Frank, who is now at sea. But it is strange<pb n="280-281"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000146"/> that we have not heard from him since he sailed on
                  board a vessel belonging to Mr. Mordant bound to the coast of Africa, under the
                  command of Captain Seymour, although the vessel has since returned from that
                  voyage and sailed again. Mother is getting very anxious regarding him."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ogilvie looked at the letter sent by Mr. Deane. "Seymour," he said, "that is
                  the name mentioned as the probable residuary legatee of Mrs. Donaldson. Do you
                  know, or have you ever heard of any family in England of that name, supposed to be
                  in any way related to or connected with your mother's friends?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, not that I am aware of."</p>
               <p>"Well, I presume that this is all the information I can glean at present. I will
                  see Mr. ——, the jeweller to-day, and this evening I will write to Mr. Deane."</p>
               <p>In the course of the day, true to, his promise, Mr. Ogilvie called at the store of
                  the jeweller, and made inquiries respecting the mysterious ring. "Do you
                  recollect," inquired he, "to whom you sold a ring of the description I speak
                  of?"</p>
               <p>"I do," said the jeweller, "for to tell the truth, Mr. Ogilvie, there are some
                  strange circumstances connected with the sale." The merchant reached down his
                  ledger and referred to the supposed date of the sale of the first ring. "Ah,"
                  continued he, "I was right; it is nearly three years ago since a gentleman, of
                  perhaps about forty years of age, accompanied by a lady greatly his Senior, yet
                  sufficiently resembling him to warrant the supposition that she was an elder
                  sister, came to my store and ordered a ring of peculiar workmanship to be
                  manufactured. They were strangers, and I should judge English people. The ring was
                  made and delivered; but the beauty and singularity of its setting led me, merely
                  out of a whim, to manufacture another exactly like it for myself. However, I did
                  not wear it, and after retaining it for some time I exposed it for sale. Shortly
                  afterwards it was purchased by a gentleman, who, singularly enough, ordered the
                  letter: to be engraved inside, which had been ordered to be engraved on the first
                  ring. I should not, however, have thought much of this, had not I manufactured two
                  others, both of which were sold, and the purchasers of both ordered the same
                  letter to be engraved. I was so struck with these singular coincidences, that I
                  mentioned the subject to my partner. However, I made, no, more of the rings, and I
                  had almost forgotten the matter until you mentioned it to-day? Now, may I ask,
                  sir, what is the reason of these inquiries being made. You will excuse me; but my
                  curiosity is strongly excited, and I think you will acknowledge naturally
                  enough."</p>
               <p>"Really Mr. ——, at present I am unable to inform you. I have reason to believe,
                  however, that some singular <foreign xml:lang="FRA">dénouûments</foreign> will be
                  made through these rings, and I promise you that when I learn the secret myself, I
                  will satisfy your curiosity. By the bye, what was the date of the sale of the
                  first of these rings?"</p>
               <p>The tradesman again referred to his books. "On the 24th of August 18—, I sold the
                  ring to the lady and gentleman I have mentioned," said he.</p>
               <p>"The 24th of August 18—," said Mr. Ogilvie, noting the date on his tablets—"Good
                  morning, Mr. ——," and so saying he left the store of the jeweller.</p>
               <p>"These duplicated sales of similar rings explain William's account of the manner
                  in which he came into possession of the ring," he soliloquised, as he walked
                  homewards, "and it also explains how the letter should have been engraved upon it;
                  but it is, indeed, a strange series of coincidences—the fact of the two other
                  purchasers ordering the same letter to be engraved on each of their rings."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ogilvie wrote to Mr. Deane that same evening, explaining the particulars he
                  had gathered, and mentioning, in parenthesis, though he did not place much
                  importance to the matter, since there might be numerous families of the same name,
                  that a brother of William Martin who was at sea—had sailed some time previous on a
                  voyage, the destination of the vessel unknown, under the command of Captain
                  Seymour, the vessel being owned by a New York merchant of the name of Mordant.</p>
               <p>A few weeks subsequently to this a vessel arrived in Boston from the coast of
                  Africa, and on board of her was Frank Martin—who had been invalided home, from the
                  G——, frigate. The first inquiries of the young sailor, whose health had been
                  nearly restored during the voyage home, was after his brother William, who he knew
                  was in Boston; and in the course of a few hours after his arrival, the
                  long-absent, sailor surprised his brother by appearing before him, sunburnt as an
                  Indian, in Mr. Ogilvie's office.</p>

               <p>IT is early morn in Zuleika's Isle. The bright sun has but now gilded the
                  mirror-like bay with his cheering beams, and the birds, aroused from their light
                  slumbers, by the genial warmth and the cheerful light shed by his rays, have
                  united their matin songs in tuneful chorus; the many and bright-hued convolvulus
                  has opened her blossoms and flowers, glittering with pearly dew, to the gladness
                  of the morning; the boughs and leaves of the rustling trees, gently bending and
                  waving to the pressure of the soft zephyrs, fresh from the sea, add to the tuneful
                  harmony of nature—the sweetest, freshest, purest, and the best; the bright green
                  herbiage of the newly mown sward glitters in the morning sunbeams, although some
                  beneficent, loving fairy hand had strewn the level expanse with diamonds during
                  the darkness of night to gratify the eyes of mortals when they awoke from their
                  slumbers; the balm of a thousand odoriferous flowers blends its sweet perfume with
                  the refreshing air of the newly-born day, and the younglings of the flocks and
                  herds skip to and fro in the meadows, in all the lightsome joyousness, the wild
                  exuberant delight of happiness and unconscious innocence.</p>
               <p>In the distance, embosomed amidst fragrant shrubs and bright green foliage, stands
                  the cottage of Zuleika. But where is she? The young Greek girl has not been, as is
                  her wont, awakened from her happy dreams by the light and warmth of the sun's
                  faint morning rays, as they stream through the open lattice of her chamber. She is
                  slumbering still now, slumbering peacefully; yet conscious, even amidst her
                  slumbers, of a mysterious; double existence; for, pillowed upon her bosom, and
                  sleeping quietly, is a fair infant, who has but daring the night awakened into
                  birth and life, and who now for<pb n="Illustration" xml:id="VAC7191-00000148"/>

                  tempered by the warmth of the sun's rays, fan her smooth and delicate cheek. There
                  is a feeble wail, and the young mother, sensitive to the slightest sound from the
                  lips of her newly-born babe, opens her heavy eyelids, and smiling sweetly, and
                  pressing the child more closely to her bosom, murmurs, "I wish that
                     <emph>he</emph> were here," and the mother and babe slumber again.</p>
               <p>There are sounds of merriment and rejoicing in Zuleika's Isle, for the fair and
                  gentle mistress of its self-appointed lord has already won the love of the simple
                  inhabitants, and it is known that she has given birth to a female child; and the
                  men forego, for this day, their customary employment. The fishing-boats lie idle
                  upon the strand to-day, and the inhabitants assemble together in groups and
                  indulge in mysterious whisperings, suggestive, we must fain believe, of
                  pleasurable ideas, for their kindly, comely countenances beam with triumphant s
                  tittles; and amongst the groves, and within the coverts of the trees, the maidens
                  weave chaplets from the store of wild flowers gathered by the happy youths, and
                  many a gentle, persuasive whisper is poured into the ear of coy, coquettish
                  maidens, by ardent swains, calling the mantling blush to the cheek and the soft
                  reproof to the lips; but the accompanying, encouraging smile tells plainly that
                  the too bold flattery is not ungraciously received, and the offence may be
                  repeated, aye, again and again, without risk of giving heinous offence.</p>
               <p>And now each maiden has woven herself a garland, and a ring is formed upon the
                  soft, smooth lawn, and the lute and the cymbal fill the air with melody, and
                  twinkling feet trip lightly to the measure upon the yielding turf, keeping time to
                  the primitive music; and forms, more graceful than those of the gazelle, wheel
                  rapidly round the circle, charming and, at the same time, bewildering the eye with
                  their rapid motions and gracefully intricate evolutions; and staid matrons, seated
                  on the grass, gaze on the festive scene with delight, as they recall to memory the
                  happy hours of days and years gone by, when, in the joyousness of their own
                  girlhood, they danced with their lovers to the same tinkling measure, and with the
                  like feelings of innocent light-heartedness. It is a day of jubilee in Zuleika's
                  Isle—the Greeks keep holiday.</p>

                  apparently hale and strong, and possessed of the fire and energy of youth,
                  betrays, in her haggard, wrinkled visage, the marks of extreme age. In her right
                  hand she holds a sappling of some six feet in length, not, as it seems, for the
                  purpose of support, but rather to serve as a wand, by the aid of which she may
                  give more energy and effect to her remarks, for ever and anon she waves it in the
                  air and points to the isles whose shadows are seen in the distant horizon, and now
                  she stamps it firmly in the sand, as though to mark the intensity of her
                  words.</p>
               <p>The other, although long past the bloom of youth, or even the comeliness of early
                  matronhood, still bears traces of having at one time been the possessor of rare
                  though savage beauty; her large black eyes, shaded by long silken lashes, glisten
                  like gems of sparkling jet beneath her dark, heavy, arched eyebrows—and the fresh
                  breezes of the sea, or, perchance, the interest of the conversation in which she
                  is so earnestly engaged, have called a ruddy glow to her sunburnt cheeks.</p>
               <p>The reader will readily recognize in these two females—Marca, the dark prophet of
                  the Isles, and Zoe, the self-acknowledged mother of Zuleika.</p>
               <p>Let us listen to the concluding remarks of their conversation.</p>
               <p>"Then Vicenzo's hated line is to renew its strength in this young scion of the
                  daughter of his scattered race," said Zoe, her eyes glaring with wild
                  energy—almost with fury as she spoke.</p>
               <p>"Fear not that," replied Marca, "the infant is a girl, and there is no harm to
                  dread from its influence; besides, the secret remains locked in our own bosoms. It
                  is our fault if we betray it. Were the babe a boy it might be otherwise; I might
                  then counsel his destruction; but, Zoe, our vengeance should be sated now. We have
                  worked it well. Let the innocent infant live; I am growing old; the dark shadows
                  of the grave are already visible to me; I would fain do one deed of mercy before
                  my eyes close in death."</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> would have vengeance to the last." answered Zoe; "but, be it as
                  you say. Let this minion live, at least for the present; perchance the Frank who
                  bought the girl of me for 800 piastres; ha! ha! it was a shrewd bargain—and who
                  married her, and is the father of her child, may remove her hence. If so it is
                  well. I will forego my sworn vengeance to blight and blast the sons and daughters
                  of Vicenzo—even to the latest generation. If she remains here she may be watched,
                  and woe to her and her's, should she discover the secret that surrounds her birth.
                  Mother, <emph>you</emph> have lived a long lifetime of vengeance. <emph>You</emph>
                  may well be sated, not so with <emph>me.</emph> I have been foiled and foiled
                  again; but each time my thirst for revenge has only grown stronger."</p>
               <p>"I have promised the Frank renegade, that no harm shall happen to his dainty bride
                  while he is absent," replied the elder woman sententiously—" the word of Marca
                  must not be lightly broken."</p>
               <p>"It is enough," answered Zoe, apparently acquiescing though unwillingly to the
                  wishes of Marca.</p>
               <p>"It is strange," she continued, "that until of late we have never met since the
                  day you sold me to the hateful embraces of Vicenzo," and as she uttered the last
                  words her eyes seemed to flash with keen but suppressed hatred towards her
                  mother.</p>
               <p>"I fled to the Negropont, after my husband was betrayed by the Scio chieftain, who
                  claimed you as his bride; but you wrong me, Zoe—I never sold you to Vicenzo's
                  harem."</p>
               <p>"It masters not," returned Zoe.</p>
               <p>"And!" asked Marca. "It is long since we have spoken together for any length of
                  time. We are alone now; the billows of the ocean, and the breezes of the
                  atmosphere can alone listen to our voices. What led you to hate Vicenzo with such
                  unrelenting, bitter hatred? You had no reason to hate him as I had, albeit you did
                  not love him."</p>
               <p>"Listen and I will tell you," returned Zoe:</p>
               <p>"It is true I did not love Vicenzo—but I was mistress of his harem and Queen of
                  his isle until he, growing sated with he, took another bride—a fair Circassian,
                  whom he had captured from the harem of her Turkish lord in one of his predatory
                  excursions oh the coast of this Bay of Salonica that lies spread before us. From
                  that hour my reign was over. I had borne a son to Vicenzo. <emph>He</emph> still
                  lives to aid me in working out my full measure of vengeance; but, let that pass.
                  My son was despised, cast off by his father when his fresh young Circassian bride
                  was taken into favor. <emph>He</emph> became an out-cast, and his mother a
                  dependent on the caprices of another. I knew not till then that I cared so much
                  for Vicenzo, but he had treated me well, and I had almost learn't to love him.</p>
               <p>"For four long years I brooded over my sorrows, until discontent grew into hatred,
                  and gradually the desire of revenge<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7191-00000151"/>
                  engrossed my soul. I bided my time. Another year passed slowly by. The Circassian,
                  Leila, still retained her power over her lord. She had borne him a daughter, whom
                  he called Mirza, within a year from the time he brought her to his harem, and
                  during this fifth year, a second daughter, Bedita, was born. My plan was resolved
                  upon: I watched the opportunity, and one day when Mirza was wandering alone by the
                  seaside, I had her seized—for I had my partisans still, who hated their chief, and
                  was carried off to Constantinople and sold, to grace the Sultan's harem, I had a
                  double revenge; for I watched with delight the anger of the father and the anguish
                  of the mother; while my girdle was weighty with the piastres that the girl's
                  marvellous beauty had drawn from the purse of the slave merchant. From that day
                  forward, the haughty, dainty Leila pined away by slow degrees beneath the ravages
                  of an insidious disease, which impaired her beauty and rendered her loathsome to
                  the proud Vicenzo. Listen!—she died from the effects of a slow but acrid poison,
                  by me administered in minute potions, and <emph>I,</emph> pretending to soothe
                  her, watched by her dying bed, alone; for Vicenzo shunned her, then: and when her
                  spirit was about to take its flight, I whispered in her ear, "it was
                     <emph>I,</emph> Zoe, who sold your first-born, Mirza, to the Mahommedan tyrant.
                  It is <emph>I,</emph> Zoe, who have administered the poison, which has brought you
                  to this bed of death and destroyed your beauty, and alienated the affections of
                  your <emph>loving</emph> lord; and, hearken, Leila: You have another daughter;
                  she, too, shall feed the lusts and pride of the detested Mussulman, and shall live
                  to curse the mother who gave her birth. The wretched woman shrieked aloud in agony
                  as I uttered this, and on the wings of that shriek her spirit took its flight. Ha!
                  ha! was not I revenged?"</p>
               <p>"Bedita was not Sold to the Turks," said Marca.</p>
               <p>"No: this Frank offered a higher price, and I sold her to him. He thought I was
                  her mother, and so Bedita thought; for during her mother's illness, and after her
                  death, she was nursed and tended by me."</p>
               <p>"And Vicenzo—how long did he live after the conspiracy had ripened which I set on
                  foot to subvert his power in these islands?"</p>
               <p>"Not long. I would tell you the manner of his death, and relate my son's history,
                  but I see people approaching us. Another time you shall know more—and
                     <emph>I</emph> must hear <emph>your</emph> history.</p>
               <p>The two women parted and walked carelessly in opposite directions, as a party of
                  pleasure seekers drew near the beach.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Let us now enter the chamber of Zuleika.</p>
               <p>The young mother is seated on her bed, propped up with pillows, and by her side
                  stands Jane Miller, not now attired in the clothing of a sailor boy; but in a garb
                  of Greek fashion more befitting her sex. She has resolved to continue her disguise
                  no longer. She is bending over the couch, and whispering words of consolation to
                  the delighted mother, who is watching with eager gaze the unconscious babe, lying
                  asleep in the arms of the negress attendant, Julia, who is sitting near the
                  casement.</p>
               <p>"Oh, that George were here to see his child," murmurs Zuleika from time to time,
                  as Jane Miller tells how proud the father will be to see the infant, and dilates
                  upon those points of resemblance to the father in the babe's features, which none
                  but woman can discern.</p>
               <p>"And is there no resemblance to me?" asks Zuleika. "I would wish my child to
                  resemble both her father and her mother. George, methinks, would wish that
                  himself."</p>
               <p>"The eyes are yours," answered Jane, "and so is the contour of the face; but the
                  nose and mouth are the counterparts of her father's. What name shall you call
                  her?"</p>
               <p>"George wished me to call the child Zuleika, if it should prove a girl," answered
                  the young mother. "It shall be as he desired."</p>
               <p>There was a few moments silence, for Zuleika was weak and easily fatigued with
                  speaking. At length she said—half unconsciously as though thinking aloud, for her
                  thoughts dwelt continually upon her husband—"George has been a long time absent
                  now. He must soon return."</p>
               <p>"It is hardly three months since he left the island, dear Zuleika," said Jane. "He
                  said he should be five months absent. We cannot expect him yet."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that he were here," answered Zuleika, repeating aloud the constant burden of
                  her thoughts; "Do you know, Jane, it may be folly—weakness on my part; but, for
                  some nights before the birth of my babe, I had strangely frightful dreams! I
                  thought there was some secret evil brewing that would work out the destruction of
                  my husband and my child—and, kind and attentive as the aged Marca has become since
                  George has been absent—how silly I was to be frightened of her—it<pb n="288-289"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000152"/> always seemed as though she were mixed up in these
                  horrible visions. I fancied I saw her gloating over my misery;—but, if aught were
                  to happen to George, I should not live long to lament his loss. I should go and
                  rejoin him, with my child, in another and a happier world."</p>
               <p>"You must strive to banish these foolish fancies," said Jane, "they are only
                  created by your anxiety and weakness. You must look forward to a happy re-union
                  with your husband, in a month or two more, and recollect his promise, that when he
                  returns you are to be parted no more on earth."</p>
               <p>"Yes, George promised he would never leave me again," said Zuleika, and her pale
                  face brightened up with the happy thought. But, although Jane Miller spoke thus
                  encouragingly to the youthful mother, her heart was filled with anxious
                  forebodings. She feared that retribution would overtake Seymour, though she was
                  ignorant of a tithe of his crimes—and she knew that should evil occur to him,
                  Zuleika spoke truly when she said that she should not long survive him.
                  Besides—although Marca had been kind to Zuleika since her husband's absence—had
                  even been assiduous in her intentions—there was something indescribable in the
                  manner of the aged sibyl—which, setting aside her witch-like appearance, had
                  rendered her—though she strove to hide her fears—a source of dislike and terror to
                  Jane.</p>
               <p>Zuleika sank upon the pillow and fell into a slumber, and Jane sat watching by her
                  side—watching anxiously—for the sleep of the pale young mother was uneasy, and
                  ever and anon she would murmur words of portentous warning, as though the seals of
                  prophesy were opened to her in her dreams; and twice she started up, uttering in
                  tones of anguish:</p>
               <p>"My babe! my babe! No, George, they shall not touch my babe!" and her eyes sought
                  the form of the infant as it still lay sleeping in the nurse's lap, and she smiled
                  at the foolish terror of her dreams, and composed herself to sleep again. And
                  while she slumbered, Marca came into the cottage, and ascending the stairs with
                  noiseless step, entered the bed-chamber, and advancing to the nurse, stooped and
                  gazed steadily into the face of the sleeping child. Then, apparently satisfied
                  with her scrutiny, she seated herself quiety by the couch of the mother, and,
                  greatly to the annoyance of Jane Miller—though she dared not express the
                  displeasure she felt—she joined her in her vigils over the slumbers of
                  Zuleika.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which King Kettle shows that he possesses as great Skill in Diplomacy as
                     more Civilized Potentates—Mr. Mordant hears more Unwelcome News, and receives a
                     visit from the Yankee Mate, Tolcroft.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. TOLCROFT, the chief officer and temporary commander of the Albatross, had
                  navigated the vessel safely in to the accustomed port in the Loango country, and
                  Tolcroft bad so far succeeded in securing the object of the voyage as to have
                  obtained the promise of a prime cargo of slaves from the famous King Kettle; but
                  his majesty of Loango had lately been visited by a missionary, who had accompanied
                  one of the crusiers during an excursion along the coast, and what between the
                  arguments—somewhat dictatorial—of the commander of the crusier, and the soft
                  persuasions of the missionary, and the gratification he had felt in the
                  presentation of a bran new marine's regimental coat with gorgeous blue worsted
                  epaulettes, the worthy monarch had experienced some twinges of conscience, and
                  began to consider whether he was actually acting in good faith towards his ally
                  and good sister potentate, Queen Victoria, of Great Britain, with whom he had
                  entered into a treaty offensive and defensive," half a dozen times over, to exert
                  his benign influence to suppress the slave trade throughout his dominions, and to
                  render such aid as lay in his power to effect the capture of any slavers that
                  should call along the coast. Still, it was a matter of serious moment to King
                  Kettle, for although the scarlet regimental coat, and the twinges of conscience,
                  and the sensations of pride at being called "my brother" the great white Queen,
                  who kept her court on the other side of sun-set, had done much to awaken a right
                  feeling in the bosom of the sable monarch, yet there were other motives; to be
                  considered, and, like a good many other potentates, King Kettle felt that he must
                  necessarily make conscience subservient to interest, if he hoped to maintain a
                  financial balance on the right side of his exchequer. Red coats and worsted
                  epaulettes, and flummery t were all very well in their way; but the disposal of
                  due good cargo of slaves would, he knew by experience, go much further to fill the
                  coffers of his money chest in his good capital of cane<pb n="290-291"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000153"/> palaces and mud houses—the city of Loango.
                  Consequently, when the Albatross arrived at Majumba, King Kettle was somewhat in a
                  state of perplexity. He had a fine lot of slaves at Quoddah, who had been eating
                  him, to use a vulgar phrase, out of house and home, during the long period they
                  had been kept in seclusion, in consequence of the visit of the man-of-war
                  schooner; besides, the paddy (rice) crops had failed, and the conjurors had told
                  him that it was necessary, to avert a famine to sacrifice fifty slaves to <hi
                     rend="i"/>Cassa Jumba, as the wrath of the <hi rend="i"/>Obeah had been kindled
                  in consequence of the long <emph>palaver</emph> the monarch had held with the
                  Englishmen. His Majesty's exchequer, too, had rep so low, during this long
                  interlude, that he had been under the necessity of imposing an income tax of one
                  peck on the bushel of rice, which sadly oppressed his subjects, who had begun to
                  cry out for measures of reform, and to threaten to overturn the ministry and
                  sacrifice the ministers themselves—not on the altar of political intrigue, but on
                  that of the great <hi rend="i"/>Jumba himself—the Devil of the country—a much more
                  expedient and expeditious method of getting rid of obnoxious ministers than that
                  practiced in more refined communities. King Kettle had so far followed the advice
                  of the conjurors as to make a great show for his people and kill three of the
                  oldest of his wives, who had grown fat and lazy, and whom he thought he could make
                  no better use of, and thus he hoped to appease the wrath of the <hi rend="i"
                  />Obeah, and postpone the sacrifice of the slaves, who would fetch a good price
                  when the next slaver arrived; but the blight in the <emph>paddy</emph> fields
                  still continued and his Majesty's subjects still grumbled more and more, as day
                  after day they brought their heavy tribute of rice and emptied it into the royal
                  treasury. In a word, King Kettle was in a quandary.</p>
               <p>At this period of disaffection, shortly after the man-of-war schooner had sailed,
                  the Albatross arrived on the coast; but it was soon evident to the keen eye of the
                  King that her master-spirit was no longer on board, to, superintend the affairs of
                  the vessel. The rigid discipline usually maintained on board the beautiful craft
                  was greatly relaxed—drunkenness and insubordination had gained the upper hand,
                  and, although Tolcroft and his brother officers managed the trading portion of
                  their business with commendable shrewdness, when the duties of the day were over,
                  the vessel's decks became a scene of lawless licentiousness.</p>
               <p>King Kettle summoned a meeting of his privy council, and submitted a respectful
                  request to the chief conjuror and magician of the empire, to meet them at the
                  board. The great man came, attended by a retinue of his followers, one of whom
                  carried him on his shoulders, so that his sacred feet Were not contaminated by the
                  dust of the earth. The great high priest was handsomely dressed in a robe of
                  lion's skin, so fashioned that the skin of the head formed a <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">capote,</foreign> and being drawn over the head of the conjuror,
                  gave him a terrific and, at the same time, a dignified aspect, the effect of which
                  was greatly enhanced by the tasteful arrangement of various and many-colored
                  snakes' skins, which were fastened around his neck, and arranged in fanciful
                  festoons round his arms, body, and legs—added to which a magnificent lion's tail,
                  artificially stiffened, was affixed to his posterior, sticking out at an angle of
                  forty-five degrees, full six feet from his body. Altogether, the mighty conjuror
                  looked awfully and impressively grand. He was received with all the honors due to
                  his sacred office. King Kettle danced before him through the village <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">in propria persona,</foreign> his attendants playing an
                  enlivening strain upon bamboo flutes and a species of drum made of monkey's hide,
                  and, at the door of the council hut, the women sat around in groups, heaping
                  handfuls of dust on their heads, and writhing and grovelling on the earth like so
                  many serpents, at the same time singing a wild chorus, extolling the might and
                  power, the glory and the beauty of the <hi rend="i"/>Cassa Jumba, and his great
                  high priest. As soon as the door of the council chamber was closed, the magician
                  graciously signified his desire that the women should be commanded to cease their
                  infernal noise; and in <emph>his</emph> turn King Kettle, anxious to do all homage
                  to his distinguished visitor, signified <emph>his</emph> gracious permission for
                  them to retire, by going out amongst them himself and kicking them away. The
                  conjuror then asked for some rum, which was handed to him, and after having
                  imbibed a huge draught, he declared himself ready to listen to his Majesty the
                  King and the mighty chiefs in council assembled.</p>
               <p>We dare not penetrate into the mysteries of the solemn conclave; the chiefs and
                  the conjurors were closeted for some hours, and the result of their deliberations
                  will he gleaned from what followed. That the meeting was harmonious and
                  satisfactory to all, may be assumed, however, from the that at the expiration of
                  the session the great conjuror and King Kettle were borne away upon the shoulders
                  of their attendants, both in a condition of beastly intoxication, while it was
                     spread<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7191-00000154"/> through the village that the
                  great <hi rend="i"/>Cassa Jumba (the devil himself) had deigned to enter in
                     <emph>spirit,</emph> into the heads of the King and the High Priest, and the
                  impost would no doubt be soon removed, and the threatened famine averted.</p>
               <p>As soon as King Kettle had recovered from the headache and the symptoms of nausea
                  which had supervened when the <emph>spirit</emph> had departed from his brain, he
                  went on board the slaver, and concluded a satisfactory bargain with Tolcroft to
                  furnish him with five hundred slaves, with all possible dispatch, expressing his
                  regret at the same time that several days must necessarily elapse before they
                  could be brought down from the depot at Quoddah.</p>
               <p>Having settled this matter, his majesty dispatched his prime minister to the city
                  of Loango, the capital of the country of that name, which is situated some seventy
                  miles to the southward of Majumba, with information to the captain of the
                  man-of-war schooner, which was believed still to be at anchor off the city, to the
                  effect that the noted slave ship, the Albatross, was in port, and that if the
                  captain would come to Majumba on a certain day, he could easily capture her—loaded
                  with negroes—and thus secure a famous prize, for which information his majesty
                  trusted the captain would take him into favorable consideration, and not fail to
                  remember him to his beloved sister, the Queen of England.</p>
               <p>This was of course good news to the officers and crew of the Queen's ship, and
                  they failed not to avail themselves of it, allowing sufficient time to elapse,
                  however, before they made their appearance off Majumba, for the slaver to perfect
                  her loading.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile King Kettle got his slaves down from the depot, and placed all on board
                  but fifty, receiving the price stipulated for the whole number; but reserving
                  fifty of the women and children to the last, on the plea that needed to recrult
                  their strength as much as possible before being confined in the baleful atmosphere
                  of the ship's hold. Had the shrewd Captain Seymour been on board the Albatross, he
                  might have had his suspicions aroused by this extraordinary show of humanity on
                  the part of King Kettle, but it was not so with Tolcroft and his subordinates, who
                  were rather glad of the opportunity afforded them of keeping the crowded 'tween
                  decks as free as possible until the vessel sailed. Slaves, to the number of four
                  hundred and fifty, were closely packed on board the ship, which still lay at
                  anchor in a narrow inlet, scarcely a rod from the shore on either side. The
                  remaining fifty were to be taken on board the following morning, after which the
                  vessel was to sail, and this night was to be one of jovial carousal in honor of
                  having so far successfully accomplished the Abject of the voyage.</p>
               <p>By midnight scarcely a soul on board the Albatross was sober, save the miserable
                  wretches who were confined beneath the hatches on the crowded slave deck.
                     <emph>They</emph> lay in heaps, groaning and struggling in all the horrors of
                  mental and bodily agony.</p>
               <p>There was a nominal watch kept on deck, but the approach of the schooner had not
                  been perceived, and she cast anchor almost at the mouth of the inlet without any
                  alarm being given. Boats were lowered, and manned and armed, and they proceeded up
                  the inlet pulling with muffled oars, and secured from observation by the dense
                  breeze which arose from the water, until they had approached within a few yards of
                  the devoted slaver. Then the half drunken watch perceived their approach, and
                  firing a pistol off at random, he gave the alarm to his comrades; but it was too
                  late, even had the officers and crew been in a situation to offer resistance. They
                  reeled and stumbled up from their carouse, hastily arming themselves with such
                  weapons as came most readily to hand; but the man-of-war's men had in the meantime
                  gained the deck, and the conflict was short and decisive—five of the drunken
                  seamen of the slaver, besides Allan and Perrin, the second and third officers,
                  were killed, and the red flag of England was run up to the gaff end of the
                  Albatross, and the beautiful vessel declared to be the lawful prize of Her
                  Majesty's schooner Audacious. She was a famous prize, for besides the head money
                  that would be paid for the slaves on board, she was amply provided with stores and
                  provisions, and the vessel herself was certain of selling for a very larger sum of
                  money. King Kettle was readily promised a handsome reward for the part he had
                  acted in giving information, and thus he not only secured the price of the whole
                  number of thus he not only secured the price of the whole number of his slaves
                  from Tolcroft, but succeeded in reserving fifty of the finest amongst the women
                  and children to offer as a propitiatory sacrifice to <hi rend="i"/>Cassa Jumba; he
                  not only satisfied the superstitions of the conjurers received a handsome douceur
                  in the shape of bounty money, into the bargain.</p>
               <p>The arrangements determined upon in the great council were admirably carried
                     out—<hi rend="i"/>Cassa Jumba had not fuddled the brains of his devotees for
                  nothing.</p>
               <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7191-00000155"/>
               <p>Before daylight the craw of the slaver were heavily ironed and confined under
                  hatches amongst the slaves; the dead had been ruthlessly thrown overboard during
                  the night, and it was thought by the slaver's crew, as welt as by the captors,
                  that the whole of the officers had been slain, for none of them were to be found
                  in, the morning. This, however, was not the case. Tolcroft, the chief, had
                  succeeded in making his escape during the affray, in a dingie belonging to the
                  ship, and had paddled out to sea. A prize crew was put on board the Albatross, and
                  she was sent to Sierra Leone to be condemned, and in the course of a day or two
                  the Audacious sailed also, it being requisite that the captain should be in Sierra
                  Leone when the Admiralty court sat.</p>
               <p>Not placing too implicit faith in the honesty of King Kettle, the captain of the
                  schooner had remained behind a day or two to search the village, and ascertain
                  whether any more slaves were confined there; but King Kettle had carefully
                  secreted the women and children, and the Audacious sailed without her commander
                  having discovered how egregiously life had been duped by the cunning Loango
                  chief.</p>
               <p>When she had fairly left the harbor, the horrid rites of the sacrifice to <hi
                     rend="i"/>Cassa Jumba, commenced; the women and children, half dead with
                  terror—for well they knew their doom, from the preparations that were going
                  forward—were brought out from their hiding-places; faggots were piled, around the
                  great square in the centre of the village, and after being scourged until the
                  blood flowed from them in torrents, the women were burned alive, amidst the
                  frantic shouts of the savages, and the devilish incantations of the conjurers. The
                  children were reserved for a still more dreadful fate. Cords, woven from cocoa-nut
                  fibres, were stretched from tree to tree, along the square, over the still
                  smouldering ashes of the hapless women, and the children were tied together by the
                  legs, and strung head downwards along the cords; fresh faggots were piled on the
                  ashes of the victims already sacrificed, and the fires were again lighted; and as
                  the flames and smoke ascended, the tom-toms beat more loudly, the bamboo flutes
                  whistled more-shrilly, and the savages, frantic with unhallowed passions, shouted,
                  and danced, and screamed, and rolled upon the earth, as though possessed with
                  devils, while above all, could be heard the agonized shrieks of the infant
                  victims, as they struggled together—tearing each other's flesh with their finger
                  nails in the intensity of the torture to which they were subjected. At length the
                  shrieks grew fainter and less frequent, as, one by one, the hapless victims died,
                  half smothered by the smoke, half roasted by the flickering flames, and the rope
                  parted, and the dead bodies dropped into the fires, which flamed up as if greedy
                  to consume them to ashes. And now the savages, who had looked on, lay panting on
                  the earth for very weariness, while the conjurers gathered together the black,
                  clammy ashes, and scattered them over the reeking bodies of the multitude,
                  rendering them repulsive in aspect to a hideous degree.<ref rend="super"

                  charred remnants of the horrible sacrifice were cast into the river, as food for
                  the alligators, and the great sacrifice to <hi rend="i"/>Cassa Jumba was over. The
                     <hi rend="i"/>Obeah's wrath was appeased, and the famine was arrested—so said,
                  the conjurers—and King Kettle promised that the impost of rice should be
                  removed.</p>
               <p>Such is the description of a scene of cruelty by no means rare in this benighted
                  land, and which may be considered partially as the result of the
                  endeavor—conceived in humanity and a spirit of philanthropy, but rife with cruelty
                  to the hapless slaves—to prevent the trade in human flesh, by the intervention of
                  armed cruisers on the African coast. It is true that, since steamers have been
                  employed on this duty, a better watch than formerly can be maintained; but it is
                  known that, although supported at an immense cost, so far, hitherto, from
                  preventing the abduction of negroes from the coast, the known vicinity of these
                  cruisers has led to the closer packing of slaves, in less commodious vessels; to
                  the sacrifice of thousands to the devilish superstitions of the savages on the
                  coast, especially when their sale has been retarded and the expense of supporting
                  them has become burdensome; while it is doubtful if one less has been brought from
                  the interior, or whether the trade has in reality been lessened in the slightest
                  degree. Only by keeping a numerous steam flotilla in continual activity on the
                  whole length of the coast, is it possible that the trade can be prevented, and as
                  regards the treaties entered into with native chiefs, they have time and time
                  again been proved to be perfectly useless.</p>
               <p>Tolcroft, who, the reader will recollect, we mentioned had effected his escape
                  from the Albatross, when she was boarded<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7191-00000156"
                  /> by the officers and crew of the cruiser, after two days' exposure, without food
                  or water, fell, in with a trading vessel, and was received on board. He stated
                  that he had made his escape from a vessel which had been seized by the savages
                  while dealing with them for ivory. He was landed, at Benguela whither the trader
                  was bound, having been generously provided by his rescuers with clothing and such
                  necessaries as he required. There he shipped on board a vessel bound to the Cape
                  of Good Hope, whence be obtained a berth on board an American vessel from
                  Calcutta, bound to New York, which had touched at the Cape on her passage from the
                  East Indies.</p>
               <p>Let us now return to New York and ascertain how affairs had progressed there since
                  the occurrence of the events described in a preceding chapter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant, the morning after he had received the letter from Mr. Grindley, left
                  his home for the city at an earlier hour than usual. On his; way he called at the
                  store of the tailor and settled the account due by his son, at the same time
                  warning the tailor not to allow Charles any further credit, excepting upon his own
                  responsibility. He then, in no very pleasant frame of mind, hastened to his office
                  to meet Mr. Grindley. He found that gentleman already waiting for him.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Grindley," said he. "I received a letter from you last night. What
                  is the nature of the pressing emergency of which you speak?"</p>
               <p>"I believe I stated, Mr. Mordant," replied Grindley, "that it had reference to the
                  capture of the Dolphin, Junot's vessel. The fellow who gave information to the
                  captain of the sloop-of war, and whose testimony in court led to the condemnation
                  of the vessel, has, I learn from your agent at Sierra Leone, let out hints that
                  the slaver was partly owned by a merchant in New York—meaning yourself—and
                  furthermore, the scoundrel has said that you have another vessel, wholly owned by
                  yourself, upon the coast. Of course he alludes to the Albatross, and a vigilant
                  look-out will be kept for her. However, she sails like a witch, and will manage to
                  elude them, I trust, as she has done before. That is not the worst feature of the
                  case. This fellow has given this information to a lawyer of low reputation in the
                  colony, who has intimated to your agent that unless you make it worth his while to
                  keep silent, he shall consider it his <emph>duty</emph> (mark the fellow's
                  impudence) to write to New York and let the particulars he has heard be generally
                  known. Now I have hitherto successfully managed this portion tion of your
                  business, and I would advise you to hush the matter up. The agent says he thinks
                  the lawyer, who is poor as well as destitute of character, can be quieted by the
                  payment of a thousand dollars, and that the sailor can be made to hold his tongue
                  for a couple of hundred more. Of course, I leave it to your own better judgment;
                  but I should say, send the money by the next mail. In such matters as these there
                  is no time to lose."</p>
               <p>"But," said Mr. Mordant, "supposing I should pay the money, what security should I
                  have that I shall not be subjected to other and still more exorbitant
                  demands?"</p>
               <p>"Why; my dear sir, though the man is destitute of any character, he still has a
                  certain outward semblance of integrity to maintain, as he holds, I am given to
                  understand, a small official appointment in the colony. If it were known that he
                  had received hush money, he would be ruined. Now, we can make him give a receipt,
                  specifying the terms on which he has received the money, and hold that receipt
                  suspended, like the sword of Damocles, over his head, read at any moment to fall
                  upon him and hurl him headlong to ruin."</p>
               <p>"What harm would it do me, supposing he fulfils the threats he has made. Who will
                  pay attention to such vague reports, and if anybody should do so, how would they
                  affect me?"</p>
               <p>"What harm would it do! How would it affect you! My dear sir, excuse me; but I am
                  surprised to hear you speak thus what harm would it do if it were known or
                  suspected that the wealthy and honorable merchant, Mr. Mordant, were connected in
                  any shape with a business which is held felonious by the laws of the country? How
                  would it affect you, sir, held up as if it were surmised, however slight the
                  grounds of the suspicion, that you were yourself an importer of slaves? I leave it
                  to yourself to judge the effect that would be produced."</p>
               <p>For some moments the merchant appeared irresolute how to act. In fact, though he
                  endeavored to maintain an appearance of outward composure, his nerves were so
                  unsettled by late events, that he scarcely knew what he was doing. At length he
                  said—"Send a draft for the payment of the money, Grindley. Send what you think
                  sufficient, and when the Albatross returns, I shall wash my hands of this business
                  altogether. I have met, of late, with nothing but mishaps. Seymour, too, to have
                  left me in the lurch, at this critical period as he had done."</p>
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7191-00000157"/>
               <p>After some further conversation regarding the capture of the Dolphin, and an
                  examination into the accounts of that vessel, so as to ascertain the exact amount
                  of the profit and loss, Mr. Grindley retired; but he had scarcely reached the
                  street before another visitor arrived. It was Mr. Harvey.</p>
               <p>"Take a seat, Mr. Harvey," said Mr. Mordant, rather testily, for he was in
                  anything but a happy humor; "to what cause am I indebted for a visit from you this
                  morning?"</p>
               <p>"I have called relative to that little matter—the estate in Jersey."</p>
               <p>"I thought that matter was settled long ago," interrupted the merchant; "I'm sure
                  I paid handsomely enough for it—three years' rental of the property."</p>
               <p>"I hoped it was settled, myself, sir," replied the lawyer coldly; "but by some
                  means the widow Miller has received an inkling of the state of affairs, and she
                  has, I understand, been consulting a certain legal gentleman of my acquaintance
                  upon the subject. I am afraid, sir, there is trouble brewing."</p>
               <p>"Dear me, this is unfortunate," answered the merchant. "What had better be
                  done?"</p>
               <p>"I would advise a compromise. If you will permit me to see the widow, I may manage
                  to effect some arrangement by which she will consent to take the estate as it now
                  stands, and forego her claims to the back rents, which must amount to many
                  thousands of dollars. I will make it appear that you have been an innocent party
                  to the—the—excuse me—the fraud; and she will be delighted at your generosity in
                  returning to her the estate, voluntarily, as it stands."</p>
               <p>"And the three thousand dollars I paid you, for the express purpose of putting the
                  evidence out of the way? that is lost I suppose."</p>
               <p>"Under the circumstances, irrecoverably lost I fear, Mr. Mordant," answered the
                  lawyer, with the utmost <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sang froid.</foreign> (The money
                  had long been made use of for his own purposes.)</p>
               <p>"Ruin stares me in the face," thought Mr. Mordant; then he said, "I have heard
                  some unpleasant intelligence, Mr. Harvey, which has utterly unfitted me for
                  business to-day. I will not prolong this interview. In God's name, see Mrs.
                  Miller, and represent things as favorably as possible; that is, if she has really
                  any suspicion how matters stand. Perhaps she may be induced to dispose of the
                  property, under the circumstances on reasonable terms. You understand."</p>
               <p>"I will do my best to put matters in a proper train," replied the lawyer, as,
                  shaking hands with the merchant, he quitted the office; but he added to himself,
                  as he descended to the street, "she may dispose of the property on reasonable
                  terms, but not to <emph>you,</emph> Mr. Mordant. No, no; I have you under my thumb
                  now, and I will make you bleed freely or effect your ruin."</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant was, as he stated, utterly unfitted for any business that day, and at
                  an early hour he left the office for his residence, hoping there to find quiet and
                  to recover his customary equanimity; but he reckoned without his host "Misfortunes
                  never come singly," says the ancient adage. Never was the proverb more fully
                  verified than in the instance of Mr. Mordant, at this period.</p>
               <p>When he reached home he found a letter awaiting him, bearing the New Orleans post
                  mark, and he recognized the handwriting, as that of Mr. Wilson. It ran as
                  follows:</p>

                           <p>I am sorry to be compelled to write to you upon a subject of so
                              distressing a nature, the more especially as I had ventured to hope
                              that the marriage of your son with my ward Marie, would lead to a
                              satisfactory arrangement as regards the settlement of our affairs,
                              Marie, having under certain circumstances at her own disposal. It was,
                              therefore, with sentiments of delight, I witnessed the devotion of Mr.
                              Charles, when he was in New Orleans last year, to Marie, who, to tell
                              the truth, is a girl whose beauty any husband might be proud of—and
                              whose disposition is amiable, while she has rendered herself
                              proficient I ball the accomplishments of the day. To my great regret
                              however, I discovered some time ago that Marie was averse to marriage;
                              from what cause require in a husband, however romantic might be her
                              ideas—unless, indeed, the girl had some prior attachment. Still I used
                              my authority to enforce a marriage which I thought so eligible in
                              every respect, and should, no doubt, have succeeded in causing Marie
                              to listen to the suit of her lover, and she could learn to love him
                              afterwards; you know that was the case with me and Mrs. Wilson—my dear
                              departed wife—she hated me when she married me, still we lived very
                              comfortably together after all. But to my dismay I learned yesterday
                              that there was an insurmountable obstacle to<pb n="300-301"
                                 xml:id="VAC7191-00000158"/> the consummation of this union—nothing
                              less, in fact—I may as well speak plainly, than a prior marriage on
                              the part of your son, whose wife is still living——."</p>

               <p>The merchant let the hand which held the letter fall in his lap, and wiped his
                  brow, on which the perspiration stood in bead-like drops, with his handkerchief.
                  "Good God!" said, "what dreadful calamity is awaiting me. Misfortune pursues me
                  unrelentingly from every quarter. My son married—I know not to whom!—probably to
                  some worthless creature, whom I cannot acknowledge as a daughter, or else why this
                  secresy on his part. My eldest daughter eloped with a music teacher; my vessel
                  captured, and threats of exposure made, by some reckless vagabond abroad; and my
                  right to this Jersey property likely to be disputed, and probably infamy to result
                  from the exposure to which the investigation may subject me; and then, this
                  reckless extravagance on the part of Charles. But he shall suffer for that. I will
                  cut him of with a shilling. I have put up with his conduct too long."</p>
               <p>But, even as he uttered the last sentence, a small, still voice seemed to whisper
                  in his ear—"What has been the cause of your son's extravagance and licentiousness.
                  As the twig is bent the tree is inclined. He who soweth the wind, must expect to
                  reap the whirlwind."</p>
               <p>The merchant banished the unpleasant thought from his mind. "Let me finish the
                  letter," he said, and again he sat himself to the task:—</p>

                           <p>"'A month or two since I took into my service a young woman, named
                              Charlotte Herbert—a young creature of pleasing exterior and lady like
                              manners—and, I fear me, I did not take sufficient precaution to
                              inquire into her character. She pleased me, however, so well; was so
                              attentive to her duties, which were those of governess to my wards and
                              nieces, that I thought? I had found a treasure in her; and—this is
                              between you and I—had some thoughts of asking her to accept the
                              position of mistress of my house, vacated by the demise of the late
                              dear departed Mrs. Wilson—I requested this Miss Herbert to exert her
                              influence with my undutiful and wayward ward, to cause her to alter
                              her sentiments with regard to Mr. Charles; and she promised to do
                              so—when lo and behold!—a pretty mess I made of it—my go-between turned
                              round upon me with a vengeance. She was a long time closeted with
                              Marie; and after waiting impatiently for near an hour, I thought I
                              would go up stairs to Marie's room. To see how matters proceeded, and
                              to add my persuasions to those of Miss Herbert. What was my
                              astonishment and anger to find the two girls sobbing in each other's
                              arms, and attaching epithets to my name anything but complimentary.
                              They started up on my entrance, and on my asking Marie whether she had
                              altered her mind with regard to your son, the minx rose from her seat,
                              and sobbing hysterically said—</p>
                           <p>"'I am free, sir, free from your vile machinations; this lady Charles
                              Mordant's wife,' pointing to Miss Herbert. 'Thank Heaven! I am free
                              from his and your importunities on this score. Now, work your will
                              towards me as you may. Death were preferable to the embraces of such a
                              monster.'</p>
                           <p>"You may imagine, I was utterly confounded with these heroics,
                              especially coming, as they did, from the lips of Marie—who is
                              generally subdued in her nature, though I believe susceptible of deep
                              feeling, and tinged with a good deal of nonsensical, romantic
                              sentiment.</p>
                           <p>"I turned for an explanation to Miss Herbert. 'What is the meaning of
                              this?' I asked 'What mummery have you been practising? Is this the way
                              in which you exert your persuasive influence?"</p>
                           <p>"Up she started, and I had a pair of female fiends confronting me.</p>
                           <p>"'It is the way in which I hope all such vile conspiracies as that in
                              which you have been engaged will be defeated,' she said. 'You only
                              know me as Miss Herbert; but, sir, I am the body and soul. My name is
                              not Charlotte Herbert, but Jeanette Dixon; and under that name, in an
                              evil hour, though thank heaven! It has been productive of one happy

                           <p>"I was so overwhelmed with astonishment that I quitted the room; the
                              two girls looked like a pair of furies, and I was really alarmed. I
                              thought it was all nonsense; but I subsequently made inquiry and find
                              it is correct. Miss Herbert of rather Miss Dixon, was married to Mr.
                              Charles at Boston, several months since, and the marriage attested by
                              a magistrate. I ordered her out of the house, forthwith, and locked
                              Marie up in her own room. <emph>I will have my revenge out of

                              be set aside, and in that case I may state that I have another neice

                              when he was here; but who was at the time too young to think of
                              matrimony, and regarding whose settlement I then had other views.</p>

               <p>Mr. Mordant heaved a deep sigh as he concluded the perusal of this letter. His
                  feeling partook alike of grief, annoyance, and indignation. "Turned the girl out
                  of doors," he said, at length. "What does the scoundrel mean by that.
                     <emph>He</emph> turned way to close of doors believing her to be

               <p>"A gentleman wishes to see you, sir," said a servant, putting his head into the
                  room and interrupting the merchant's soliloquy.</p>
               <p>Desire him to send up his name," said Mr. Mordant. "I cannot see any visitors
                  to-night, I will see him to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"If you please, sir, I think I know the gentleman; it is Captain Seymour, whom I
                  have seen here several times."</p>
               <p>"Captain Seymour! Are you sure, Thomas?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; I can't be mistaken in him."</p>
               <p>"Desire him to step up stairs."</p>
               <p>"Captain Seymour!" soliloquised the merchant, as the servant went to deliver his
                  message. "What does his unexpected visit bode? Some fresh misfortune; or will it
                  prove the pivot on which my late mishaps will turn in a more favorable
                  direction?"</p>
               <p>Captain Seymour entered the study.</p>
               <p>"Seymour," said the merchant, not giving his visitor time to speak, "I am truly
                  glad to see you, though you played me a scurvy trick in quitting the Albatross as
                  you did, in a foreign port. But, take a seat and let me hear your news. Do you
                  bring me any favorable intelligence of the vessel?"</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to say, Mr. Mordant," said Seymour, "that I am the bearer your
                  ill-tidings with regard to the Albatross; for I presume from your question, that
                  you have not yet heard the an hour since posted up in the Merchant's Exchange. The
                  Albatross, with a full cargo of slaves, has been captured with all her crew, in
                  Majumba Bay, by the British war schooner Audacious, and condemned at Sierra Leone
                  as a lawful prize to the captors."</p>
               <p>The intelligence fell so heavily, so suddenly, so unexpectedly upon the ears of
                  the merchant, that he was deprived of the power of utterance. His head fell on his
                  breast and his face grew purple as he gasped for breath.</p>
               <p>"You are ill, sir," said Seymour, hastening towards him, and unloosing his
                  neckcolth; "allow me to ring for assistance."</p>
               <p>"No, no!" gasped the merchant—"No. I shall be better presently—a glass of water if
                  you please—the news was so sudden—but you, how did you escape? Ah! I forgot—my
                  mind is strangely bewildered to-night—you were not on board. Captain Seymour," he
                  added, abruptly, starting from his seat, "you are privy to this, sir; you have
                  entered into a conspiracy against me."</p>
               <p>"Be calm, Mr. Mordant, pray be calm," replied Seymour. "You must be aware that I
                  am incapable of such an act as that you charge me with. Circumstances over which I
                  had no control, compelled me to leave the vessel at Annabon; but had I been on
                  board, I could not have prevented her capture. After all she must have paid you
                  handsomely; paid for herself over and over again. She is gone, and her loss cannot
                  be helped."</p>
               <p>"And the Dolphin has gone likewise," interrupted the merchant, reseating himself,
                  and in some degree recovering his composure.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, as I have said, you have made money out of them, and other ships may
                  be built or purchased, which may still make money in the trade. It does not answer
                  to be<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7191-00000160"/> daunted by misfortune. Had I
                  succumbed to adverse influences I should long ago have given myself over to
                  despair."</p>
               <p>"I shall not engage in the slave trade again," said Mr. Mordant.</p>
               <p>"I am rejoiced to hear you say so, sir," answered Seymour. "I have arrived at a
                  similar resolve myself. I only reached New York to-day, and should have called to
                  inform you of my determination to retire from the sea, to-night, even had I not
                  heard of the loss of the Albatross—I must say it grieves me sorely. A true sailor,
                  Mr. Mordant, loves his ship almost as well as he loves his mistress, and the
                  Albatross was all that could delight the eye of a seaman. Pity that so sweet a
                  craft should fall into the hands of the Philistines! I half think, had I been on
                  board, I would have sunk her first, and gone to bottom with her myself. But it is
                  useless to regret that which is past and cannot be recalled. If you are able to
                  listen to me I will settle matters, so far as we are concerned, and that critical
                  juncture."</p>
               <p>"Go on, Captain Seymour, go on," said Mr. Mordant. "Misfortune has pressed heavily
                  upon me of late. I don not serve to divert my mind from dwelling upon my present
                  difficulties."</p>
               <p>Seymour had barely commenced to speak when the servant, Thomas, again made his
                  appearance at the door of the study.</p>
               <p>"A man dressed as a sailor is below, and wishes to see you," said he.</p>
               <p>"I can see no one to-night, Thomas," replied Mr. Mordant, angrily. "What can the
                  man want with me? Tell him to call to-morrow at my office. And do not let me be
                  interrupted again to-night.</p>
               <p>"I told him you could not see him to-night, sir," said the servant; "but he became
                  boisterous, and would take no denial. He says his name is Tolcroft, and that he
                  was chief mate of the Albatross."</p>
               <p>"Tolcroft! Chief mate of the Albatross!" exclaimed Mr. Mordant, looking
                  suspiciously at Seymour.</p>
               <p>"Tolcroft!" said Seymour. "What d—l's wind could have blown him here? I thought he
                  had been captured with the vessel at Majumba.</p>
               <p>The servant stared in astonishment at astonishment at them both.</p>
               <p>"You knew that this man was here?" said Mr. Mordant, addressing Seymour.</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, I did not; I am as much surprised as yourself. I thought he had been
                  captured with the vessel."</p>
               <p>Boisterous exclamations were heard in the passage, interrupted with sundry oaths,
                  and presently a heavy footstep was heard ascending the stairs.</p>
               <p>"Tell the man to come up, Thomas," said Mr. Mordant, making a virtue of necessity,
                  and he had scarcely spoken the words before Tolcroft entered the room, attired in
                  coarse, tarry, seaman's clothing, and deeply intoxicated.</p>
               <p>He was known to the merchant, who, eyeing him sternly, demanded what had brought
                  him there in that condition.</p>
               <p>"My lower timbers, I guess, master," rejoined the drunken seaman; "but I've had a
                  mortal foul wind and heavy weather. It was tack ship all the way, and two or three
                  times I came near foundering; but I've got into harbor at last, and now, as I've
                  furled my sails, and am safe in port, I'll provision the hold, by your leave. I
                  see you've got some liquor on the table, and my throat's as dry as a ship's
                  rigging, after running the Trades down."</p>
               <p>Tolcroft had not seen Seymour, who had purposely hitched his chair back to avoid
                  observation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant was speechless with astonishment at the man's insolent behavior, and
                  Tolcroft coolly filled a tumbler with wine and drank it off at a draught.</p>
               <p>"What is your business with me?" said the merchant, at length, partially
                  recovering himself.</p>
               <p>"Business—business enough. The Albatross has gone to the d—l and Davy Jones, and
                  I'm stranded on a lee shore; who should I come to but to you to tow me off again;
                  I'm hard up; not a shot left in the locker, and you must come down handsomely, or
                  else by —— it'll be the worse for you."</p>
               <p>"Sirrah!" exclaimed Mr. Mordant, "what do you mean by this insolence? Begone, or
                  I'll have you turned out of doors."</p>
               <p>"I objects to that, master," said the drunken seaman; "out of here I shan't budge
                  a foot till you shell out enough to set me going on a spree, and I shall come for
                  more to-morrow, and more after that again and again. You can't gammon old
                  Tolcroft."</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant rang the bell, and the servant appeared.</p>
               <p>"Thomas, go immediately and call a policeman," said he.</p>
               <p>"Not so fast," said Tolcroft, stepping towards the door at<pb n="306-307"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000161"/> which the servant was standing, and causing that
                  functionary to make a precipitate retreat, under the Impression that the sailor
                  was about to hurl him down stairs. He closed and locked the door. "Now Mr.
                  Mordant," said he; but at that moment his eye fell on Seymour, who had until now
                  been concealed by a screen. He started back with mingled astonishment and dismay
                  depicted In: his countenance; The old habit of discipline; obtained the mastery
                  over him, and assuming that ludicrous attempt to appear sober, peculiar to a
                  drunken man, when he wishes to disguise his condition, he balanced himself by
                  placing on the table, and with the other pulled his forelock, and scraping his
                  foot backwards, made an awkward, salt-water salute to his old commander.</p>
               <p>"How do I see you in this disgraceful condition, Tolcroft?" said Seymour; sternly;
                  "and what do you do here, conducting yourself in this outrageous manner?"</p>
               <p>"cap'n'—Cap'n Seymour, I'm hard up,' said the seaman; "and, axing yer pardon, I
                  thowt as Mr. Mordant, who owned the ship in which all I had was taken from me,
                  ought to do somethin' to help a poor fellow out of his trouble."</p>
               <p>"And this is the way you choose to seek for relief, is it, sirrah?" continued
                  Seymour. "You come with violence and threats—dare to come here in such a beastly
                  state of drunkenness that you are hardly able to stand."</p>
               <p>"Sober—sober—as a judge, Cap'n," stammered the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >ci-devant</foreign> mate of the Albatross, proving his assertion by stumbling
                  backwards and falling headlong to the floor.</p>
               <p>"The policeman is here, sir," said the servant, putting his head in at the door,
                  and looking warily round, ready to start back at the least show of pugnacity on
                  the part of the sailor.</p>
               <p>Tolcroft lay 'rolling about the floor, muttering to himself, and thinly
                  endeavoring to regain his feet.</p>
               <p>"Allow me to settle this matter to-night, Mr. Mordant," said Seymour; "the fellow
                  will do as I tell him." Then, stepping out, he made some explanation to the
                  policeman, and bringing him into the room, assisted him to raise the drunker
                  sailor.</p>
               <p>"Tolcroft," be said, when they had with difficulty enabled him to regain an
                  upright posture, "you will go with this gentleman, and he will provide you with a
                  comfortable Bight's lodging, and, to-morrow you will come to me at the Astor
                  House. You will direct him to do this in the morning," continued he, addressing
                  the officer.</p>
               <p>"I will, sir," said the policeman.</p>
               <p>"Now, Tolcroft, you hear what I say; go away quietly with this gentleman, and in
                  the morning I will see what I can do for you."</p>
               <p>"Any—thing t—t—t' oblige you, captain," stammered the mate; "st—st—steady as—the
                  main truck. But as for this f—f—fellow," shaking his fist at the merchant, "when I
                  c—c—catch him aboard th'—th' Albatross, I'll p—p—punch his head."</p>
               <p>He was led, meek as a lamb, out of the room by the officer, and when they were
                  gone Seymour said—</p>
               <p>"I see you are disconcerted to-night, Mr. Mordant, and I will intrude upon you no
                  longer. I am stopping at the Astor House; but, with your leave, I will call
                  to-morrow and renew my acquaintance with the ladies. I trust that stormy as things
                  may look at present, all will yet go well" So saying he wished the merchant good
                  night, and left the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant sat for some time after his strangely unexpected visitors had
                  departed, absorbed in reverie of, to judge from the expression of his countenance,
                  no pleasing character. "Good God!" said he, at length, as he rose from his seat
                  and prepared to retire, "what will be the upshot of all this?"</p>
               <p>Seymour reached the hotel and went to his room. It was growing late, and he was
                  fatigued; but before he prepared to retire to rest, he sat down by the table in
                  his bed-room, and leaning his head on his hands, fell into a profound reverie. His
                  thoughts were far distant—across the blue water, amongst the lovely islands of the
                  Grecian sea. "Where is Zuleika now?" he murmured. "What is she doing at this
                  moment? Is she thinking of mer poor child, as fondly as I am of her? I cannot
                  doubt it. Am I a father? Perhaps, ere this, Zuleika has borne me a child. Oh, what
                  would I not give now to know that she were well—to see her for one moment. Well,
                  well; a very short time will enable me to settle all my affairs in this country,
                  and then for Zuleika and love! I will quit her no more. Together, in some secluded
                  valley, in Switzerland, perhaps, wife, will find a home, and, I trust, lasting
                  happiness. It has been a romantic dream—this fancy of mine—to endeavor to educate
                  a Wife from girlhood upwards, in seclusion—to keep her from all contact with the
                  cold and heartless world. But when I shall be always with her, my Zuleika shall go
                  more into society—she shall be admired as she deserves to be. I find that the
                  social instinct of man's nature will not<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7191-00000162"
                  /> allow him to be happy in solitude; but Zuleika has borne this for me, and lives
                  only in the of my love. So far my scheme has succeeded. Poor child! I wonder if
                  her babe is a boy; or a girl, and whether it resembles her. If it does: I shall be
                  jealous, especially if it be a girt t could not bear to see. a second Zuleika,
                  rivalling her mother's charms. Perhaps—but no, I will not allow myself She is
                  young and healthful, and must be thriving still.</p>
               <p>How hollow seem be the pleasures ad vanities of the world, when I think of
                  Zuleika! it thought, once and I half reason to think so, that all mankind, and
                  womankind, too, were deceitful and wicked I swore enmity against my race. But I
                  think differently now, and perhaps I become reconciled to mankind when I live
                  constantly with her." He raised his and leading upon his elbow commenced building
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Chateaux d' Espagne,</foreign> and so sat in a
                  half-waking dream for hours, until some noise in the street aroused him. The gray
                  light of dawn was stealing into has room, and smiling at his abstraction, he
                  hastily threw off his clothes, and getting into his room. And the candles were
                  expiring in their sockets. He started up and smiling at this abstraction he
                  hastily threw off his clothes, and his boyish days, and his past career of lawless
                  and crime. Alternate lights and shadows passed over his mental vision, as thus he
                  lay sleeping until a late hour in the morning; but there was one glorious image
                  mixed with all, whose presence diffused a halo over the darkest shadows, and gave
                  additional refulgence to the brightest fancies of his dreams. It was the image of
                  Zuleika, now fitting before hi as the little blue-eyed girl, gazing curiously and
                  timidly around her in the slave market at Constantinople; now as the young,
                  newly-wedded bride, upon whose lips he pressed the <emph>husband's</emph> first
                  kiss of love, on the island of Annabon; now again, as last he had seen her, when,
                  with tearful eyes, she clung to him as he embraced her and bade her farewell, ere
                  he stepped into the boat that was to bear him to the felucca; and now—but this
                  last image was dim and indistinct, and some envious shadow seemed to obscure his
                  vision, as he would have prolonged his gaze upon this, the fairest picture of
                  all—he saw her, the mother of a lovely babe, blushing with delight and love, and
                  proud in her young matronhood, flying to meet him, bearing the infant in her arms,
                  as once again his boat's prow touched the shore, and he stepped lightly and gaily
                  upon the level strand of Zuleika's Isle.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Frank Martin Returns Home, and has an interview with Seymour, during which some
                     strange Revelations are made.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>"WHY Frank, I should scarcely have recognized you, had I mer you in the streets,"
                  said William Martin, after the first joyful greetings had passed between him and
                  his brother—in Mr. Ogilvie's office. "Why, how brown you are, almost as dark as an
                  Indian, and how stout you have grown, and tall too; why you are bigger every way
                  than I am—well, what news do you bring? Oh, Frank, you were a sad dog not you
                  write to us after you sailed from New York with Captain Seymour. You surely have
                  never thought of the anxiety that your silence has occasioned to mother and to all
                  if us; but what wind has blown you here?"</p>
               <p>"A good easterly wind, which in spite of its aguish tendency is sometimes of
                  service," replied Frank; "but I came home in a merchant ship from Sierra Leone,
                  having been invalided from the United States ship G——, on board which I have been
                  serving for some months past—and which will arrive home herself soon, for she was
                  to sail shortly after I left, for Norfolk. Yellow Jack got a hard gripe of me, and
                  the captain of the G—— who is as good a fellow as ever trod a ship's deck—shipped
                  me off only a week or two before-hand for fear that I should suffer a
                  relapse."</p>
               <p>"Then you have been employed in the national service, Frank?" said William Martin.
                  "How was that? we had no information of it."</p>
               <p>"Neither did I," replied Frank, "I assure you I went on board a man-of-war,
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sans ceremonie,</foreign> having been wicked up at sea
                  with just the toggery I happened to have on—little enough in all conscience."</p>
               <p>"How? Were you wrecked?" asked William.</p>
               <p>Wrecked! nay—a d—lish sight worse—burnt out; a fate bad enough to befall a poor
                  fellow on land; but still worse at sea, where there are no back doors to escape
                  from."</p>
               <p>"Then Captain Seymour's ship—what was her name? She belonged, if I recollect
                  aright, to a merchant in New York named Mordant—has gone to the bottom. We should
                     have<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7191-00000163"/> been sadly distressed had we
                  heard of the accident. Strange! we did not hear one word of it."</p>
               <p>"The Albatross, the ship you speak of, may have gone to the bottom, or she may
                  still be pursuing her unhallowed trade above water, for aught I know," said Frank.
                  "I left her some time before the accident of which I speak."</p>
               <p>"You speak in enigmas, Frank. You must have had as many adventures since you left
                  the old homestead at Camden, as that Robinson Crusoe, whose history you were so
                  fond of reading when a boy. Come, let's hear your story, in regular order, from
                  beginning to end."</p>
               <p>Frank commenced the narrative from the day he was sent on board the Albatross,
                  continuing it to the hear of his reaching Boston, on his return from the coast. As
                  the reader is acquainted with the material of the narrative, we shall hot repeat
                  it; but it proved very interesting to William Martin, whose quiet profession, as a
                  lawyer's clerk, had occasioned him to lead a life of quiet monotony, far removed
                  from the excitement and the perils which befall those whose vocation leads them
                  forth to do business on the "vasty deep."</p>
               <p>"I declare, Prank, you have had an abundance of adventures since last, we met,"
                  said William Martin, when his brother had concluded his narrative; "but the
                  thought has just flashed through my mind—Do you know anything of the antecedents
                  of this Captain Seymour, with whom you sailed from New York, and who fired upon
                  you when endeavoring to effect your escape from the Albatross?"</p>
               <p>"No. He is a strange customer altogether—an educated man, gentlemanly in
                  appearance, and very handsome; but the very d—I when his passions are aroused; but
                  Why da you ask?"</p>
               <p>"Simply because a matter has turned up possessing considerable interest to our
                  family, which I will recount the you by-and-by, and Mr. Ogilvie mentioned the name
                  of Seymour as being connected with it; but there, may be a hundred families of
                  that name, to be sure."</p>
               <p>"No time like the present," exclaimed Frank. "I have told you my story, now tell
                  me yours. I You say it treats of matters interesting to our family—I should like
                  to hear it"</p>
               <p>William Martin related to his brother all that he knew himself with regard to the
                  circumstances detailed by Mr. Deane. In the course of which narration, he alluded
                  to the ring worn by Jessica Deane, which had attracted the notice of Mrs.
                  Donaldson.</p>
               <p>"What sort of a ring was that of which you speak?" interrupted Frank. "Describe it
                  again, will you?"</p>
               <p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed, when his brother had obeyed him, "that's an exact
                  description of the ring that Charlotte Herbert wore on her finger, and which I
                  took from her hand after she was in the water. I thought she had perished from,
                  cold and exposure; and, although I scarcely hoped to be saved myself, yet I
                  thought the ring might be a valuable memento to her family—should my life be
                  preserved. I gave it back to her, a day or two after we got on board the G——: it
                  had the letter 'J' engraved on the inside, and was altogether the very counterpart
                  of the ring you have described."</p>
               <p>"There is a string of mysteries depending upon rings of that kind, I think," said
                  William Martin—"the coincidences, to say the least, are very remarkable."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ogilvie called William from the inner office, and he left his brother alone
                  for a few moments. Frank took up one of the New York morning papers which lay upon
                  the table, and glanced his eyes carelessly over the columns. Presently his
                  attention appeared to be deeply interested in a paragraph, and he was still
                  reading when his brother re-entered.</p>
               <p>"What so deeply absorbs your attention in that newspaper, Frank?" asked
                  William.</p>
               <p>"It's a fortunate thing I left the Albatross," answered Frank, "I see by this
                  paper that she has been captured off the coast of Africa, with a full cargo of
                  slaves on board, and carried as a prize into Sierra Leone, where she has been
                  condemned. She arrived there, I see by the date, only the day after I sailed; the
                  news has arrived soon—but the old tub that I came home in sailed like a dung
                  barge."</p>
               <p>"Captain Seymour will find himself in an awkward predicament?" said William.</p>
               <p>"Why, no, if he had been captured, I think his name would have been mentioned. To
                  be sure, he might have been killed in the skirmish, if as I suppose, a skirmish
                  took place; but I father think he must have made. his escape, for I see, in the
                  list of arrivals at the hotels the name of Captain Seymour, at the Astor
                  House."</p>
               <p>"He ought to be arrested," said William.</p>
               <p>"I don't see," replied his brother, "that that would serve any purpose. No
                  cognizance could be taken relative the capture of the Albatross in the United
                  States."</p>
               <p>"No, but I mean for the attempt made to take your life."</p>
               <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7191-00000164"/>
               <p>"Oh, as for that, I doubt if I could make out a case against his sufficiently have
                  to account. You Know I have no witnesses. There would be simply my own testimony.
                  However, I must say I should like to confront him. I shall pass through New York
                  on my way home, for I wise to see Mr. Mordant, and I shall certainly endeavor to
                  see this Captain Seymour also, that is, if I find he is the person I suspect him
                  to be."</p>
               <p>"I wish you would let me introduce you to Mr. Ogilvie, Frank," said William. "He
                  probably would to see you relative to this affair of ours he has on hand."</p>
               <p>"With alt my heart," replied Prank, and the two brothers entered together into Mr.
                  Ogilvie's private office.</p>
               <p>The lawyer welcomed the brother of his favorite clerk, and listened with interest
                  to his, narrative; which William, at the instance of Mr. Ogilvie, insisted upon
                  his repeating.</p>
               <p>"I suppose you are anxious to see your mother and sister, after so long an
                  absence," said" he, "but I approve of your resolve to call upon Mr. Mordant, whose
                  conduct towards you has been to say the least, highly reprehensible, and while you
                  are in New York, certainly endeavor to discover whether the Captain Seymour
                  mentioned as having arrived at the Astor House be really your did commander."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ogilvie invited the young sailor to dine with him; but the train was to leave
                  in an hour, and wishing his brother and newly-found, friend farewell, Frank got on
                  board tile cars, and was soon whirling away at the rate of thirty miles an hour
                  towards New York.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordant was seated in his office on the morning of the second day after Ms
                  interview with Seymour, when he was informed that a young man had called and
                  Wished to see him.</p>
               <p>"Show him in," said the merchant, and Frank Martin was shown into the room.</p>
               <p>"What is yow business with me young man?" asked Mr. Mordant, who was not
                  personally acquainted with the youth. "My name is Martin, sir," replied Frank.</p>
               <p>"I was apprenticed to you some three years since, and last sailed in your service
                  under Captain Seymour of the Albatross."</p>
               <p>Mre Mordant, to use a seaman's expression, was taken "all aback" at this
                  announcement. It seemed as if difficulties were increasing upon him to such a
                  degree as perfectly to overwhelm him. He imagined that the youth had made his
                  escape after the capture of the slaver, and like Tolcroft, had now called upon him
                  for the purpose of demanding hush money, and he replied—</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for the mishap which has befallen that ill-fated vessel, my lad, and
                  if you are in need of assistance, I shall be glad to help you. I have other ships,
                  in one of which I will procure you a berth; meanwhile here is some money for your
                  present necessities," taking a roll of notes from his pocket.</p>
               <p>"I do not need assistance, sir, and I was not on board the Albatross at the time
                  she was seized by the cruiser—I escaped from her in the Bay of Aracati, after
                  having been fired upon by Captain Seymour and his officers—because I no longer
                  wished to remain on board a vessel engaged in a disreputable and illegal traffic.
                  I have called upon you to demand my release from the indentures which bind me to
                  serve you for five years. Agree to do that and I shall trouble you no farther. I
                  wish, however, to know whether the Captain Seymour, who, I perceive from the
                  papers, is now stopping at the Astor House; in this city, is the Captain Seymour
                  who formerly commanded the Albatross?"</p>
               <p>"He is—he is, young man," replied the merchant, hurriedly, for he was so excited
                  that he scarcely knew what he was saying. "And—what else did you say? Ah! your
                  indentures. Yes, I will cancel your indentures—and if at any time you
                  should——"</p>
               <p>"Write me a document signifying that you have cancelled my indentures, and give
                  them up to me," said Frank, interrupting the merchant, "and I will neither ask nor
                  accept any further favors from you, Mr. Mordant."</p>
               <p>The merchant was an old and wealthy man, an influential member of society; one
                  whom, to be acquainted with, was considered to stamp the respectability of the
                  happy possessor of that acquaintanceship. Frank Martin was a mere youth—a sailor
                  boy—who had to fight the battle of life unaided, and to win his way upwards step
                  by step by his own exertions; but the moral courage bestowed by conscious
                  innocence and the cowardice of conscious guilt were clearly demonstrated in the
                  course of this brief interview;—the gray-haired merchant, quailed before the calm,
                  clear blue eye of the youthful sailor, and without saying another word, he
                  withdrew from a desk the indenture spoken of, cancelled it, and handed it to
                  Frank. Then, as the youth was about to leave the office, he would have renewed his
                  offers of assistance—</p>
               <p>"I am sorry," he said, "that matters have happened thus<pb n="314-315"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000165"/> unfortunately. I hope, young man, you will have the
                  discretion to keep your own counsel, and I shall——"</p>
               <p>"You need fear nothing from me, sir," replied Frank, again interrupting the
                  merchant. "I am not yet fallen so low as to become an informer."</p>
               <p>Without deigning to await the merchant's response, he turned on his heel and
                  quitted the office, carelessly crumpling the cancelled indenture in his hand, and
                  thrusting it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>When he had left, Mr. Mordant gave way to a reverie, in which thoughts of the most
                  painful and distracting nature intruded themselves. He felt truly repentant of the
                  course he had for several years pursued, and by the means of which he had very
                  considerably increased his wealth; but whether the repentance was realtor whether
                  it was only that which sooner or later always overtakes the doer of evil, and is
                  oftener caused by regret at the failure of his schemes, and by the dread of that
                  retribution which he fears awaits him, than by remorse for his past conduct, we
                  leave to the reader who has been afforded an insight into the principles which
                  actuated the merchant in his undertakings and speculations, to decide.</p>
               <p>Frank Martin resolved to call upon Captain Seymour that evening; meanwhile he went
                  home to his lodgings, where he found a letter awaiting him from his brother,
                  acquainting him of the arrival of Mr. Deane in New York—which intelligence had
                  been received shortly after he had left Boston, and requesting him to call upon
                  that gentleman, who had taken rooms at the same hotel with Seymour.</p>
               <p>"I don't know this Mr. Deane," said Frank to himself, when he read the letter;
                  "but, as it will be all in my way when I call at the Astor House to-night, I
                  suppose I must make myself known to him. I wonder if Jessica, the young lady
                  William thinks so much of, is with him. If I thought she were, I should like to
                  see her. Yes, I'll call on Mr. Deane before I see Captain Seymour to-night."</p>
               <p>Having arrayed himself in his best, in the hope that; Jessica Deane had
                  accompanied her father to New York, and naturally wishing to make as favorable an
                  impression as possible in the eyes of his brother's sweetheart, Frank presented
                  himself at seven o'clock at the door of the apartments occupied by Mr. Deane in
                  the hotel. He was kindly welcomed for his brother's sake, and as he had
                  anticipated, Jessica Deane had accompanied her father to the city.</p>
               <p>"My Daughter, Mr. Martin," said Mr. Deane, presenting the young seaman to the
                  beautiful girl. "You, have no doubt, heard William speak of her. You must be
                  friends with William Martin's brother, Jessie," (addressing his daughter); and
                  leading her to the youth, he placed the young lady's hand in that of Frank.</p>
               <p>Jessica blushed and smiled, and said she should always be happy to enrol in her
                  list of friends any relative of William Martin; and Frank, as he felt the soft,
                  electric touch, and saw the kindling blush that suffused her cheek, and marked her
                  blue eyes, downcast with modesty, and yet beaming with delight, half envied his
                  brother's good fortune, and wondered if he, rude sailor as he was, would ever meet
                  with such a neat, tidy, little consort—willing to journey side by side with
                     <emph>him</emph> across the stormy ocean of life.</p>
               <p>"I presume your brother has informed you, Mr. Martin, of the interesting
                  circumstances that have lately transpired relative to your family and Mrs.
                  Donaldson?" said Mr. Deane, after some preliminary conversation had taken
                  place.</p>
               <p>"He has, sir," replied Frank, "and I need scarcely say that I hope matters will
                  turn out favorably for us; but, I cannot stay long to-night. I will see you again
                  before I start for Camden. I have to call upon a gentleman who is putting up at
                  this hotel—one Captain Seymour, under whose command I once sailed."</p>
               <p>"Captain Seymour—Seymour!" said Mr. Deane, "there is a person of that name
                  connected with this affair between Mrs. Donaldson and your family. He will be the
                  residuary legatee in case the old lady should die without making a will. However,
                  there are, of course, <emph>many</emph> persons of that name. Still, I should like
                  to see this Captain Seymour."</p>
               <p>"You can easily do that, sir; though, perhaps, it would not be so easy a matter to
                  assure yourself of his identity with the person in question. I would ask you to
                  step up to his room with me, but it is bettor that I should first see him
                  alone."</p>
               <p>Wishing Mr. Deane and his daughter good night, Frank, having procured the
                  direction and the number of the apartment, from a waiter, proceeded to Captain
                  Seymour's room. He knocked at the door, and shortly he heard the well-known voice
                  of his late commander, utter the words—</p>
               <p>"Come in,"</p>
               <p>Frank entered the room. Seymour was seated at the table, writing; and before him,
                  on the table, lay an open locket,<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7191-00000166"/>
                  containing the portrait of Zuleika; lie raised his head as the young man entered,
                  and looked at him inquiringly, not immediately recognizing him.</p>
               <p>"Do you not know me, Captain Seymour?" said Frank, "my name is Martin—Frank
                  Martin. I sailed with you on board the Albatross."</p>
               <p>"And took French leave of me, in Aracati Bay, boy," exclaimed Seymour, rising from
                  his seat and frankly extending his hand to the youth, "Well, I would have caught
                  you if I could; but you managed to get the better of me. It was as well. You have
                  heard, I presume, that the Albatross has been captured off the coast of Africa. It
                  has been a bad business throughout; and now, I have resolved to abandon it for
                  ever. Let by-gones be by-gones, boy. Come, sit you down and join me in a bottle of
                  wine; and we'll chat of old times. Perhaps, I did not use you well as regards that
                  last little affair; but my passions were uppermost and I scarcely knew what I did.
                  "Come, sit down," he repeated, "the sight of an old shipmate refreshes me.
                  Tolcroft is here; but the beast is half crazy with delirium tremens, and I have
                  had to send him to the hospital."</p>
               <p>The young sailor was utterly thrown off his guard by the frank, open manner of his
                  former captain. He had entered the room expecting to find Seymour alarmed at
                  seeing him; and had anticipated angry words and recriminations on both sides; but
                  the captain was confident in his own power to sway men to his will, and in this
                  instance he had not exerted it in vain. Frank took the extended hand, accepted
                  Seymour's invitation, and in the course of a quarter of an hour, the two sailors,
                  different as were their relative positions and circumstances, were chatting
                  merrily over the incidents of former days, and calling up old reminiscences with
                  all the gusto of those aged veterans who are so fond of sailing their voyages and
                  fighting their battles over again, in the snug shelter of the chimney corner.</p>
               <p>"And what do you intend doing with yourself now?" asked Seymour, after a pause in
                  the conversation.</p>
               <p>"I have not thought of anything yet. I shall go to sea again, I suppose; but not
                  in one of Mr. Mordant's ships. I have had enough of them. Meanwhile, I am going
                  home to see my mother and sister. By-the-by," he continued, carelessly, for the
                  wine he had drunk had made him foolishly communicative, "a streak of good fortune,
                  as it may turn out, has befallen us since I have been absent from home. An old
                  lady—an Englishwoman, I fancy—has discovered that my mother is a relation of hers,
                  and that nay sister is her namesake, and she is going to leave Sarah her property.
                  Her name is Donaldson. My mother's name was Donaldson before——"</p>
               <p>"Donaldson! an Englishwoman!" exclaimed Seymour. "Your mother's name was Donaldson
                  before she was married, Frank? What part of England did she come from?"</p>
               <p>"I think I have heard her say from Somersetshire," replied Frank.</p>
               <p>"The Donaldsons of Somersetshire! Good heavens! it must be the same family. Did
                  you ever hear your mother mention the name of Seymour?"</p>
               <p>"Not that I know of," said Frank; "but that reminds me—Mr. Deane, the lawyer, who
                  is investigating this matter, has said something about a person of the name of
                  Seymour, who is concerned in the matter. That is, who will be the heir to the old
                  lady's property provided she dies without making a will (which I pray to God she
                  won't do) or something of that sort. Mr. Deane and I were talking about it just
                  now."</p>
               <p>"Talking about it just now, boy? Is Mr. Deane here?"</p>
               <p>"He occupies a room below, and when I mentioned your name he said he should like
                  to see you."</p>
               <p>"I will go and see him at once—nay, stay—go you to him, Frank, and make Captain
                  Seymour's compliments and ask Mr. Deane if he can make it convenient to come up to
                  my room—with you, Frank, mind, with you."</p>
               <p>"What's in the wind now?" thought Frank, as he proceeded to deliver the message.
                  "Wonders will never cease."</p>
               <p>In the course of a few minutes the young man returned with Mr. Deane, to whom he
                  introduced Capt. Seymour.</p>
               <p>"I have requested the favor of your company, sir," said Seymour, entering at once
                  into the subject, "to ask you some questions relative to the business you have, I
                  understand, on hand, in which my young friend here is interested. He says that you
                  have spoken of a person named Seymour, in connection with one Mrs. Donaldson, who
                  is, or professes to be, a relative of this young man's mother. Do you know the
                  degree of relationship, if any, that exists between this Mr. Seymour and Mrs.
                  Donaldson?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know that I am justified in stating all that Mrs. Donaldson has related
                  to me in confidence," replied Mr. Deane, "but I presume, from your asking the
                  question, that you imagine<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7191-00000167"/> gine
                  yourself to be the person alluded to under the name of Seymour. I will state that
                  Colonel, the Hon. Alfred Seymour, I believe, some time about the commencement of
                  the present century—I do not recollect the exact date—married a Miss Mary
                  Donaldson, the eldest daughter of one James Donaldson, of Rose Abbey, in the
                  County of Somerset, England—I am sorry to add, that from all I can learn, the
                  colonel sadly neglected the lady, who died of a broken heart, through her
                  husband's conduct, leaving issue by the colonel, one son named Alfred, who was
                  brought by his father, while still a lad, to America. He married, when he arrived
                  at man's estate, a young French lady, then residing with her guardian in
                  Louisiana, and died a few years after his marriage, leaving his widow with one
                  only child. What became of this boy, whether he be still living or not, I cannot
                  say; but it is this son of Alfred Seymour to whom Mrs. Donaldson alludes. It was
                  her eldest sister who married Colonel Seymour."</p>
               <p>"What relationship does Mrs. Donaldson bear to Mrs. Martin, the mother of our
                  young friend here? Pardon me for being so curious, but I am singularly interested
                  in this matter."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Martin is the niece of Mrs. Sarah Donaldson, and, I believe, her only living
                  relative, except this grand-nephew, Seymour, now alive. On the death of Mr.
                  Donaldson, of Rose Abbey, he bequeathed his property to his second daughter,
                  Sarah, the elder daughter, Mary, haying died before her father, who refused to
                  leave a single shilling to his graceless son-in-law, who, by the way, from all I
                  can learn, did not need the money, being both wealthy and highly connected. Mrs.
                  Donaldson wishes to leave her fortune to her niece; but failing to establish this
                  claim, this young man, Seymour, should he ever turn up, would be the heir."</p>
               <p>"Frank, my lad," said Seymour, taking the astonished youth by the hand, and
                  shaking it heartily, "I grant it is a sort of Scotch relationship, although it
                  does not go back quite to the thirty-second degree. But as your great aunt and my
                  great aunt are both one and the same person—viz., this Mrs. Sarah Donaldson this
                  gentleman speaks of—for I am the grandson of Colonel Alfred Seymour—we must be
                  cousins in some sort of way, boy. I don't say that you have any reason to feel
                  proud of your newly-discovered relative"—and he laughed a hollow laugh—"but at all
                  events, if I can furnish a link in the chain of identity, I will do so with
                  pleasure. It's not often I have the chance to do good service, and still seldomer
                  that I feel inclined"—and he again laughed that short, hollow laugh—"but I owe you
                  a good turn, as a set-off against a past offence, and you shall have the benefit
                  of it. As to my being heir to the property, that's all moonshine. I have money
                  enough, if that will bring peace and happiness; besides, did not old Mr. Donaldson
                  cut off his son-in-law, my graceless grand-daddy, with a shilling? But come,
                  Frank, you have a brother and a sister and a mother living; they are all relatives
                  of mine. I must see them. And Mr. Deane," addressing the lawyer, "I must have the
                  pleasure of an introduction, through you, to this venerable old grand-aunt of
                  mine, of whom you speak."</p>
               <p>Frank was so amazed at what he had heard—his interview with Seymour had been
                  productive of fruit so entirely different from what he had anticipated—that he
                  could not reply; but Mr. Deane, who was delighted at the turn matters had taken,
                  shook Captain Seymour by the hand, and asked him to dine with him on the following
                  day.</p>
               <p>"And, my dear sir," he added, "if you think of going to Camden with Master Frank,
                  and visiting your newly-discovered relatives, we will travel all together as far
                  as Augusta, where I will introduce you to Mrs. Donaldson, who, perhaps, may be
                  induced to accompany you to Camden, when she finds that her object is so
                  satisfactorily attained. I need not say that I am gratified at the turn matters
                  have taken. The main cause of my visiting New York was to institute inquiries with
                  regard to this business, and I care not how soon I return home."</p>
               <p>Seymour accepted the invitation, adding, "I do feel inclined to visit Camden, but
                  my visit must of necessity be short; for as soon as I have satisfactorily arranged
                  certain business I have on hand, I am going to Europe, whence, in all probability,
                  I may never return. Still, I will see these relatives of mine before I go."</p>
               <p>On the following day Seymour and Frank dined in Mr. Deane's room, and the former
                  was introduced to Jessica. During the progress of the meal, his attention seemed
                  to be strangely fixed upon the young lady, so much so, indeed, that he replied In
                  quite an absent manner to various remarks that fell from the lips of her father.
                  At length he could no longer control his curiosity.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid I shall appear rude," he said; "but may I ask you, Miss Deane, to
                  allow me to examine that ring you wear on your finger. I have seen but one that
                  resembled it; and there are singular circumstances connected with its
                  history."</p>
               <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7191-00000168"/>
               <p>The young lady drew the ring from her finger, and placed it in Seymour's hand. He
                  examined it closely, and, apparently in a careless manner, glanced at the inside.
                  There was the letter: engraved in the old Roman character. Without making any
                  remark, he returned it to the young lady; but various strange thoughts passed
                  through his mind. This little episode was not observed by Mr. Deane nor by Frank,
                  who were both deeply engaged in conversation at the time, or possibly some
                  explanation might have been vouchsafed to Seymour. As it was, his fancy was left
                  to its own imaginings.</p>
               <p>The next day the party set out for Augusta, and Seymour was introduced to Mrs.
                  Donaldson; and, as Mr. Deane had anticipated, the lady gladly consented to join
                  Seymour and Frank in their anticipated journey to Camden.</p>
               <p>"It is singular about that ring," thought Seymour, as he was undressing himself
                  that night in his chamber in Mr. Deane's house at Augusta. "I must see Mrs. Miller
                  on my return to New York, and ascertain whether she has heard any thing of poor
                  Jane. I could swear that the ring Miss Jessica Deane wears is the one I presented
                  to Jane Miller. Let me see—this is Wednesday—to-morrow night I shall be at Camden.
                  I will remain there till Saturday, and be back in New York by Tuesday or Wednesday
                  next, at the latest. By the middle of the ensuing week I can arrange all my
                  affairs—and then for the East and my Zuleika."</p>

               </argument>
               <p>RETURN we to the Ægean Sea and Zuleika's Isle. Two weary months have passed away
                  since the events occurred which we have recorded in a former chapter relative to
                  the birth of Zuleika's child. Two weary months—and yet not altogether weary, for
                  every day brought nearer the long-hoped-for reunion of Zuleika and her
                  husband—this time all the more anxiously, eagerly longed for, because of the
                  desire the young mother possessed to present to her husband the first-born pledge
                  of their mutual love; not altogether weary, although each day and each hour was
                  counted; for a novel occupation now engrossed Zuleika's formerly idle moments, and
                  divided her thoughts, and hopes, and fears. She had a babe on whom to bestow the
                  words of affection that would Otherwise have been breathed to the heedless winds,
                  and the love and attendance that babe required at her hands made the hours pass
                  away more swiftly than if, as formerly, her books and her music had been her sole
                  amusements. Still, although, day by day, the hours sped rapidly enough away, the
                  time that had passed by seemed long, and long it seemed to look forward, even
                  beyond the short space which must yet elapse ere she could hope that every hour
                  would bring tidings of the absent one.</p>
               <p>Zuleika had been brought very low during her confinement, and the anxiety she had
                  felt had pressed severely upon her, and aided in retarding her recovery. She was
                  not really ill, and yet the bloom had fled from her cheeks, and the roundness had
                  faded from her form. Still she looked all the more lovely; she had lost nothing of
                  her native grace, her womanly beauty, but she had added to her charms an
                  etherialness, a spirituality, which made her appear too pure, too fair, too much
                  of an angel, to linger long upon earth. And Jane Miller, as she gazed upon her
                  fragile form, and watched the emotions of her pallid, speaking countenance, half
                  feared that she was not long to remain an inhabitant of this world; and while she
                  feared, could not dispossess herself of the belief that even like her
                  namesake—Selim's betrothed bride—it were well if she died ere her trust in
                  Seymour's honor and truth were broken—ere, perchance, her own purity and innocence
                  were lost. She then could have whispered— <q>

               <p>And still she hoped that fate might yet have a happy earthly future in store for
                  her—that she might recover her wonted health and, elasticity of spirit, when once
                  Seymour returned, and the corroding anxiety that was wearing her away was removed,
                  and she hoped that Seymour himself might reform, and, resolving never again to
                  leave his lovely bride, might<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7191-00000169"/> spend the
                  latter portion of his life in a manner better calculated to win him peace, and
                  Content, and happiness, than that which had characterized his earlier career. And
                  others, too, looked with eyes of love and pity upon the gentle Zuleika; the Greek
                  maidens, as they passed by, would cease their light, joyous songs; and advancing
                  near to her, as she sat on a rustic seat that had been constructed upon the beach,
                  with the baby in her lap, gazing thoughtfully upon the sea, far, far into the
                  distance, as though she sought to pierce the horizon and descry her husband's
                  bark, long ere it drew near the shore, would with gentle, pitying smiles, admire
                  the infant's beauty, and bid the fair youthful mother be of good cheer, for the
                  wind was fair, and perhaps her lord would arrive on the morrow, and then they
                  would join their own favored lovers, and whisper to them their hopes and fears. It
                  was a great incentive to love-making amongst the youths and maidens of Zuleika's
                  Isle, this sympathy that all felt, the aged as well as the young, towards its fair
                  and gentle mistress. All but two: those two were Marca and Zoe. They did not
                  openly dare to wish her ill—they did not even secretly seek to do her harm; yet
                  any one who scanned the expression of their features when they gazed upon the
                  young mother and her infant, would readily have discerned the secret hatred they
                  bore towards them both.</p>
               <p>Zoe had departed from the island shortly after the conversation had taken place
                  between her and Marca, on the morning of the baby's birth. The reader will
                  recollect that on that occasion they had been interrupted in their conversation on
                  the sea-shore by a party of pleasure-seekers that chance had brought near the
                  beach. They had separated just as Zoe had promised to relate her son's history,
                  and had expressed a desire to hear that of Marca during the long period they had
                  been separated. Zoe had only returned a few hours, when she and her mother again
                  met, oft the very spot where they had stood on the occasion of the conversation
                  already recorded.</p>
               <p>"How fares Vicenzo's daughter and child?" asked Zoe of the aged sibyl, after they
                  had met and exchanged a few words of greeting.</p>
               <p>"The flower fades, and the bud will be blighted ere the blossom unfolds," replied
                  Marca.</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> have tended her in her sickness?" replied Zoe, inquiringly, and
                  casting a glance of strange meaning towards her mother.</p>
               <p>"No; I know what you would infer, Zoe;" answered Marca; "but no; I have sought to
                  do no evil to either, but the withering curse that I bestowed upon the betrayer
                  and murderer of my husband will light upon all his descendants, until every one in
                  whose veins runs the blood of Vicenzo shall have perished, I would have spared
                  this child; but the decree has gone forth—I cannot stay the operations of the
                  curse I have evoked."</p>
               <p>"Say rather," sneered Zoe, "that the powers of heaven and hell have decreed
                  vengeance on the hated despoiler—even to his children's children. Your feeble
                  curse can do little harm, mother. I take braver and surer means to work out my
                  vengeance. How long would it have taken to work out the death of Leila—the
                  destruction of Vicenzo—if your foolish curse had been the only vengeance
                  employed?"</p>
               <p>Marca was about to retort angrily, for she was vain of the credit she had
                  established of possessing the power of dispensing evil to all who fell under her
                  ban; but her reply was cut short by Zoe, who said, curtly—</p>
               <p>"It is enough, mother; it is enough. Make the simple islanders believe in and
                  dread your, power as long as you may; but speak not of it to me. Listen, and I
                  will relate to you my son's history. <emph>He</emph> yet lives to aid
                     <emph>me</emph> in my plans of vengance against his hated father's race.</p>
               <p>"Vicenzo, when first he took me, against my will, to be the favorite bride and
                  mistress of his harem—avished freely upon me the wealth that he had hoarded during
                  his successful forays upon the Grecian and Turkish coasts, and I, silly child that
                  I was, almost learned to love him, though I always felt a fear creep over me when
                  I was summoned to his apartment—and fear is a sad foe to love. Two years after I
                  left my native mountains, I bore Vicenzo a son, whom he called Abdallah, and whom
                  I fondly hoped would live to succeed his father as prince and chieftain of these
                  isles, and lord of the countless galleys which in former days swept these seas,
                  and claimed tribute from every mariner who was bold enough to plow their waters
                  with his keel. But it was a vain and foolish dream that of mine. Vicenzo planned a
                  desperate attack upon Larissa, where Ismael Pasha had collected immense treasure.
                  He succeeded, and his galleys returned laden with spoil; and amongst that spoil
                  was a young Circassian, whom Ismael had but a short time before purchased of a
                  mountain chief, who said she was his child. Her beauty fired the heart of Vicenzo;
                  be gave, himself up to pleasure, and allowed the rich treasure<pb n="324-325"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000170"/> he had captured to be shared amongst his followers,
                  reserving only to himself that which he prized beyond all, the fair Leila—the
                  mother of Bedita.</p>
               <p>"From that day I was reduced from the mistress of Vicenzo's harem—from the light
                  of his life,' as he was accustomed to style me, to the veriest slave that ever
                  pandered to the vile whims of a renegade pirate chief. My boy was
                  discarded—disowned. The love Vicenzo had appeared to bear toward me was turned to
                  hatred. I know not whether Leila exerted her influence to cause this. I do not
                  think she did. She was a mere dainty toy—too insipid either to love or to hate.
                  But it was through her that this evil befel me, and I swore revenge upon her. How
                  I succeeded you already know.</p>
               <p>"But with regard to my son Abdallah, I breathed words of vengeance into his young
                  ear. I taught him to hate his father; and as he grew up, the sweetest music to my
                  ears was his expressions of demoniac vengance. A young Frank, one from the far
                  distant land of the West, came to our shores; he was no other than the present
                  husband of Zuleika. I knew him as the youth who purchased Bedita of me in the
                  market place at Stamboul. He joined the pirate horde of which Abdallah was the
                  leader. He was brave to rashness. I told my son that he had purchased Bedita, and,
                  as I had heard, intended to make her his bride. To make my vengeance complete, I
                  resolved that the betrothed husband of the daughter should take the life of the
                  father. Enough: during an attack led by Abdallah upon the stronghold of Vicenzo,
                  on the Island of Scio, he fell—cleft to the shoulder by the sabre of the Frank
                  pirate. Bedita's husband has his hands dyed with the blood of her father!</p>
               <p>"I lost sight of the Frank for many years—but at last he returned bringing with
                  him as his bride the young Bedita. He called her Zuleika. He loves her; that is
                  sufficient to arouse in me fresh schemes of vengeance. Zuleika and her babe may
                  yet be spared; but she shall suffer sorrow so deep that she shall wish for death,
                  and a heavy doom shall fall on him who dares to love a daughter of Vicenzo.</p>
               <p>"My son is now-on the Hellespont; and this Frank shall find that he still lives,
                  and find it to his cost—though, as yet, I wait for the turn of circumstances to
                  mature my schemes. Now, mother, let me hear your history during the many long
                  years you were absent—as I thought dead."</p>
               <p>"My tale is brief," replied Marca. "You know, daughter of mine, that my husband
                  once ruled over the islands which afterwards Vicenzo claimed as his own; but you
                  knew not that he was your uncle. Arnault, my husband, was the elder brother of
                  Vicenzo—the lineal descendant of a race of Greek warriors. He rescued Vicenzo, his
                  younger brother, from the Turks of Salonica, and, bringing him to Scio, placed him
                  next to himself in command; but Vicenzo saw me—I was young and handsome then—Time,
                  and Grief, and Revenge, have made me what I am now. Arnault was absent with his
                  galleys, and Vicenzo, who was left in command of the fortress, took advantage of
                  Arnault's absence to work his base will on me. I resisted; but of what avail was
                  the resistance of a weak woman. Vicenzo gained his end, and then threatened my
                  life if I informed my husband. Nay, he threatened your life—you were then a mere
                  child—if I betrayed him to his brother. Fears for you, not for myself, kept me
                  silent.</p>
               <p>"Years passed away, and Vicenzo began to envy his brother the dominion over the
                  isles of which he was the sovereign ruler; and, on condition that he should remain
                  an possession of the fortress of Scio, he betrayed Arnault to the Turk. My husband
                  was seized and brutally tortured in my presence. He died beneath the torture, and
                  then I was compelled to give my forced consent to Vicenzo's marriage with you. You
                  were led to his harem; you know the rest. I was banished, sold into slavery, and
                  for years I pined beneath its horrors; but I at length escaped, and, unknown to
                  you, I aided in spreading disaffection amongst the enemies of Vicenzo. I have
                  lived to see him slain; to see his family scattered. One daughter—the innocent
                  bride of the Frank—alone remains. Zoe, I am growing aged. Our vengeance has been
                  deep and sure. Let us snare Zuleika?"</p>
               <p>"Her life! Yes: I will not take <emph>her</emph> life; but she shall feel the
                  bitterness of living-death," exclaimed Zoe, "it is useless to ask further mercy at
                  my hands than this. But away; she dreads me, and I see her approaching. We must
                  not be seen together."</p>
               <p>And the mother and daughter parted. Zuleika, accompanied by Jane Miller,
                  approached the beach; and the former seated herself upon her accustomed seat and
                  gazed with her earnest, thoughtful gaze, into the deep, blue horizon.</p>
               <p>"You feel stronger, to-day, dear Zuleika," said Jane Miller, "do you not? Your
                  color is heightened and you look more like the Zuleika of our early acquaintance
                  again."</p>
               <pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7191-00000171"/>
               <p>"Yes, I am better," replied Zuleika, "every day that brings the hour nearer when I
                  may expect George to return, gives me renewed hope; and I feel the blood course
                  more freely through my veins. But still I do not sleep well at night; and I dream
                  strange, mournful dreams. Jane, you once loved George; so you yourself told me.
                  How could you bear to live, when once you knew he did not love you?"</p>
               <p>"Why do you ask?" said Jane, who was as much surprised at the tone in which the
                  question was asked, as at its purport.</p>
               <p>"Only, because, if George should ever cease to love me—should he even bestow a
                  portion of his love upon another—I should wish to die."</p>
               <p>"But you forget that Captain Seymour never knew of—never, therefore, could
                  reciprocate my love," replied Jane. "Had he loved me, as he loves you, and had
                  that love faded away or been transferred to another, the case would have been
                  different."</p>
               <p>"George never will forsake' me, now; now I have a babe to cement our union," said
                  Zuleika, thoughtfully, as though speaking to herself, "but, I wish he were here;
                  for I have strange, fearful dreams, and we islanders are a little prone to
                  superstition," she added, smiling a forced smile, which ill-concealed the
                  uneasiness which rankled beneath.</p>
               <p>"Do not give way to these feelings of despondency, dear Zuleika," replied Jane, "I
                  trust a long future of happiness awaits you."</p>
               <p>"And when George comes back, you will leave me, Jane?"</p>
               <p>"Yes: Seymour will probably recognize me, now I have lain aside my disguise, and
                  allowed my hair to grow long. If not, I shall tell my story and trust to his
                  generosity to procure my return to my home. I have been very foolish, Zuleika, and
                  I have suffered for my folly; probably shame and disgrace await me on my return;
                  but I have brought it on myself and must bear the burden."</p>
               <p>"Disgrace await you!" exclaimed Zuleika. "Nay, Jane—your mother and friends will
                  be too happy to have you restored to them again—and perhaps—when George lives
                  always with me, and I accompany him wherever he goes—he may take me to America,
                  and I may visit you at your own home. Will not that be delightful? How gaily we
                  shall tell over our old adventures."</p>
               <p>"Poor, simple child!" thought Jane Miller—though she did not reply, "how little
                  you know of the ways of the world. May you always remain as innocent and
                  unsuspecting."</p>
               <p>Several weeks passed away, and every evening Zuleika, accompanied by Jane Miller,
                  visited the beach, and sat watching the broad expanse of water, and as the day of
                  Seymour's expected arrival drew nigh, fancying that every strange prow that loomed
                  through the evening haze, might be that of the returning wanderer. Often
                  expectation grew into fancied certainty, and as often relapsed into sad
                  disappointment, as vessel after vessel flitted by, like shadows, bound to some
                  port or other amongst the numerous islands. But, one evening, just as the two
                  young women were about to enter their cottage for the night—a large felucca was
                  seen standing directly towards them. She was still a long way distant; but some
                  strange instinct seemed to tell Zuleika that that felucca had on board her long
                  expected husband. In vain Jane Miller, fearful of disappointment, endeavored to
                  restrain her excitement.</p>
               <p>"No—no—,"she cried, "that is he—that is George returned at last. I am sure that it
                  is he."</p>
               <p>A white flag, the well-known signal, was shortly seen floating from the end of the
                  gaff topsail boom. And Jane herself was satisfied at last, that Seymour had indeed
                  arrived.</p>
               <p>The felucca gracefully "rounded to" a short distance from the shore, and a small
                  boat was lowered from her stern, into which a tall figure was seen to descend,
                  which both Zuleika and Jane recognized as that of Seymour, A few vigorous strokes
                  brought the boat to the landing-place—and Seymour sprung to the strand. In another
                  instant Zuleika was locked in her husband's embrace.</p>
               <p>"George—dear George—my husband—our child, George!" She wildly gasped—and then her
                  feelings overpowered her and she sank fainting Into Seymour's arms, her head
                  resting upon his bosom.</p>
               <p>And tenderly as a mother would bear a new born babe, Seymour bore the fainting
                  girl towards the cottage.</p>

                     bargain—Mr. Harvey displays his cunning, with advantage to himself.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE beg the reader to follow us, in imagination, into the interior of one of the
                  finest mansions in —— Place, New York. Seated upon a sofa in a spacious parlor
                  magnificently furnished with all the appliances that wealth and refinement are
                  able to procure, are two ladies, one considerably advanced in years; but so
                  elegantly attired and so well preserved, that the ravages of time are scarcely
                  perceptible on her still smooth cheek and unwrinkled brow. The other, still a mere
                  girl, is richly but more simply attired than her companion. Both are engaged in
                  earnest conversation, and notwithstanding the rich heavy drapery of the curtains
                  obscures the light that would otherwise stream in through the windows, and gives
                  the room a sombre aspect, still increased by the heavy, rich furniture, the
                  gorgeous, velvet tapestry carpet, and the massive gilt chandeliers that depend
                  from the ceiling, it is evident that the countenances of both the ladies show
                  traces of deep distress. These ladies are Mrs. Mordant and her daughter Mary.</p>
               <p>Let us listen to the conversation that is going forward.</p>
               <p>"Papa will surely receive her back home again, dear mamma," said Mary Mordant to
                  her mother, in reply to some remark the latter had made.</p>
               <p>"I scarcely know, Mary," returned Mrs. Mordant, "your father is justly and highly
                  exasperated. The fact of her marriage with that swindler—which, in spite of all
                  our efforts to conceal it, has become only too well known, might have been got
                  over; we might have spread the report abroad that the fellow was really the German
                  Count he falsely represented himself to be, and since Sarah had sacrificed herself
                  beyond redemption, your father might have procured some situation, at a distance
                  from the city, for her husband, and so in time the disgraceful affair might have
                  been hushed up and eventually forgotten. Indeed I had almost persuaded him to
                  exert himself for this purpose, and he was on the point of sending them some money
                  for their immediate necessities, when this letter arrived from the graceless girl,
                  announcing that her husband had absconded, taking with him a quantity of money and
                  valuables he had purloined from some of the lodgers in the hotel in Western
                  Canada, and that she has been detained by the hotel keeper, who holds her
                  responsible for the robbery. The affair has got into the newspapers—worded
                  mysteriously, but quite plain and significant enough to render it intelligible,
                  and in fact, Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Doughty, who called this morning on a
                  visit—purposely I believe to insult me, and who left just before you came down
                  stairs, had the effrontery to commiserate my misfortune, and to express a hope
                  that the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">faux pas</foreign> of my eldest daughter might
                  serve as a lesson to you. Oh—dear—dear. I shall never be able to survive this
                  disgrace. It will be the topic of conversation not only throughout our own set,
                  but will afford matter for scandal to all the gossips of the city. To think that a
                  daughter of mine—brought up as Sarah has been with so much care, and in such
                  correct principles—always kept aloof from low people—should so far forget
                  herself!" and the old lady had again recourse to a flood of tears.</p>
               <p>"And Louisa Jones and Lucy Doughty will be so glad of it. I'm sure they will—the
                  stuck up creatures!" said Mary, "they have always been envious of us because papa
                  is richer than Mr. Doughty and Mr. Jones—who both made their money as clothiers,
                  down town, while papa is a merchant and ship owner—and of course, far above
                     <emph>them.</emph> It couldn't be expected that Sarah and I could exactly treat
                  Louisa and Lucy as our equals, although they went to the same school, and gave
                  themselves such airs; and now, they'll have their revenge. I shall be ashamed to
                  look them in the face again—I'm sure I shall." And Mary followed the example of
                  her mother, and giving way to a flood of tears, caused by mingled grief and
                  vexation, buried her face in her handkerchief.</p>
               <p>"And then there's that man Dixon, the Quaker at Philadelphia," said Mrs. Mordant,
                  still sobbing hysterically as she spoke—he has written to your father, threatening
                  to sue Charles for damages—in consequence of life having married that hussy of a
                  daughter of his, and then left her, and tried to enter into another matrimonial
                  engagement with Mr. Wilson's niece. Oh dear! Oh dear! What will become of us?"</p>
               <p>"Papa has money enough, ma, to satisfy him. I am sure I think Charles was right,
                  not to take up with such a low creature as Jeanette Dixon—who has been running
                  round the<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7191-00000173"/> world with some horrid
                  sailors as Mr. Wilson says, and as she herself confesses."</p>
               <p>"I am not so sure that your pa' has money to spare just now, my love. He never
                  tells me anything about his circumstances, which I think is wrong; but I read some
                  letters the other day, when he left the key of his writing desk at home, which
                  satisfied me that he was just now greatly embarrassed, and the other day I asked
                  him for some money, and for the first time in his life he refused me, and made
                  some rude remark to the effect that he had something else to do with his money
                  besides spending it in diamonds and such like trumpery; the result was that I was
                  obliged to appear at Mrs. Phillpot's party with my old-fashioned jewels, while
                  that odious Mrs. Doughty had a splendid new diamond necklace and bracelets."</p>
               <p>"Oh ma'! you don't mean to say that pa' is a ruined man?" exclaimed Mary. "That
                  would be horrible—worse than all—I'm sure I could never survive it. Pa' should
                  have more regard for his family than to ruin himself."</p>
               <p>"I don't assert, my dear, that he is a ruined man; but I feel confident, from
                  various incidents that have happened of late, that he is temporarily embarrassed.
                  He has suffered great losses in shipping; and since Captain Seymour came back he
                  has been very cross and disconsolate. Since he received Sarah's letter I have been
                  afraid to speak to him; and then there is that odious, vulgar Mr. Grindley,
                  calling, upon him every day and sitting with him for hours; and when he is not
                  here, Mr. Harvey is. Altogether I am almost driven out of my senses."</p>
               <p>"No wonder, ma'; but what is to become of Sarah?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I can't say," replied Mrs. Mordant. "I can hardly make up my mind to cast
                  her off altogether, for I feel that she is still my child; but your father, since
                  this morning, has been raving like a maniac, and he swears that she shall never
                  darken his doors again."</p>
               <p>"Sarah was always forward with the men," said Mary, who appeared to be dreadfully
                  embittered against her sister. "She used to make me perfectly ashamed, the way she
                  used to flirt with Captain Seymour, and he jilted her after all; and served her
                  right."</p>
               <p>Leaving the two ladies to their conversation, let us ascend to the study of Mr.
                  Mordant, where he is sitting at the table at which we have heretofore introduced
                  him to the reader, again busily occupied with a file of papers and documents of
                  various kinds, although his attention appeared to be absorbed at this moment in
                  the perusal of a letter he holds in his hand. Vexation is depicted in his
                  countenance, and muttered objurgations fall from his lips as he peruses the letter
                  again for the third or fourth time. It has arrived this very morning from Canada,
                  and its contents run as follows:</p>

                              <salute>DEAR PAPA AND MAMMA:—</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>Hardly a month has elapsed since I foolishly allowed my
                                 <emph>affections</emph> to be entrapped by that wicked man, who
                              deceived me into marrying him, under the belief that he was not Henry
                              Hecker, the music teacher, but Count Von Kemperblossen, and that I had
                              become a Countess by marrying him. Oh, papa and mamma, your
                                 <emph>erring but affectionate</emph> daughter has been grossly
                                 <emph>deceived</emph> and <emph>betrayed,</emph> and she now sues
                              for your forgiveness.</p>
                           <p>We waited a fornight at Toronto, after I wrote the first letter to
                              you, announcing, as I thought, my <emph>happy</emph> and
                                 <emph>fortunate,</emph> marriage, but finding that you sent no
                              reply and no <emph>money,</emph> Henry became cross and sulky, and one
                              day, he started off in a hurry for this place. Here his conduct became
                              still worse; in fact, <emph>unbearable;</emph> he grew
                                 <emph>slovenly</emph> and <emph>careless</emph> as regarded his
                              personal appearance,—and, <emph>would you believe it?</emph> his hair
                              and moustache turned red again. I asked him how it was, for I still
                              loved him, and thought perhaps grief for me (because you had
                              apparently forsaken me), had changed their color again, <emph>as they
                                 did once before.</emph> But I am <emph>shocked</emph> to write it!
                              He made use of a <emph>naughty</emph> word, and said he had no money
                              to purchase dye with. So his beautiful hair and moustache were dyed! I
                              couldn't <emph>bear</emph> to see them in that frizzy state—and as red
                              as carrots too—so, in my innocence, I brought him an ink bottle, and
                              begged him to stain them with ink; and he said another naughty word
                              and flung the ink bottle at me, and absolutely <emph>ruined</emph> my
                                 <emph>best</emph> dress. I burst into tears and then he came up and
                              kissed me, and said he would <emph>forgive</emph> me, if on the next
                              day I would write to you; and I promised I would. It was yesterday I
                              was going to write, but during the evening some travellers came to the
                              hotel, and Henry introduced himself to them, and staid drinking with
                              them till past midnight; and then, instead of coming to bed, he told
                              me that the night was fine, and he should walk out and clear his head
                              from the fumes<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7191-00000174"/> of
                                 liquor—<emph>faugh!</emph> could I have thought that of Henry
                                 <emph>a month ago?</emph> But Henry didn't come back, and I was
                                 <emph>dreadfully</emph> frightened all night, and still more
                              frightened in the morning when the landlord came in and told me that
                              my husband had broken open the traveller's boxes, and stolen their
                              money, and had gone off besides with the <emph>silver spoons</emph>
                              belonging to the hotel, and that the should hold me accountable. I
                              indignantly denied that Henry was <emph>capable</emph> of any such
                              deed, and said he was the Count Von Kempenblossen in disguise; but the
                              landlord had the impudence to tell me that he believed I was an
                              accomplice, and that he should send me to prison. So I burst into
                              tears, and told him and all the men and women present, that I was the
                              daughter of Mr. Mordant, the great New York merchant and ship-owner;
                              and a little man, in a shabby black coat, with his cuffs all stained
                              with ink, who they called a reporter, began making marks on a piece of
                              paper, <emph>taking down,</emph> he said, all I told. The landlord
                              seemed inclined to believe me, and said he wouldn't send me to prison;
                              but would keep me for the present locked up in my room, if I would
                              write to you and ask you to refund the money for our board, and also
                              the value of the stolen property, which he states amounts to $700.00,
                              besides a fortnight's board for me and Henry, $150.00, including wines
                              (Henry used to drink a great deal of wine, and always the best and the
                                 <emph>most expensive</emph>). I said I would; and he left me,
                              giving me till to-day to compose myself; but I shall <emph>never
                                 compose</emph> myself again. In the evening the chambermaid, who
                              brought me my tea, brought also a weekly paper, that was printed
                              during the afternoon, and what do you think that impudent reporter had
                              done? Why, put the story into the newspaper and published it. I send
                              you the paragraph, which I cut out and have wafered it in my
                              letter.</p>
                           <p>Now, dear papa and mamma, pray don't be angry with your erring,
                                 <emph>heart-broken,</emph> and truly <emph>repentant</emph> child;
                              but pray send me the money and as much more as will bring me home
                              again, or else I shall be driven to <emph>desperation,</emph> and
                              shall climb up the chimney (for the door is locked and the windows are
                              barred), and shall make my escape over the roof of the house and go
                              and <emph>drown myself</emph> in the St. Lawrence. I have fully
                                 <emph>made up my mind</emph> to do that if you don't send the
                              money.</p>
                           <p>Dear papa and mamma; your <emph>heart-broken, erring</emph> and

               <q>
                  <p>"A strange and rather exciting affair came off this morning at the —— Hotel. It
                     appears that a fortnight ago a German, and a female whom he called his wife,
                     came up from Toronto, and took lodgings at the above hotel. They had but little
                     luggage, and as they did not offer to pay their board in advance—the landlord
                     two days since, presented his bill to the man who had been living in most
                     expensive style, and making free use of our worthy townsman's splendid wines.
                     He promised payment the next day; and that same evening a party of travellers
                     arrived with whom he ingratiated himself, and he remained in their company
                     until midnight. In the morning it was discovered that their trunks had been
                     broken open, and their money and valuables extracted, and subsequently it was
                     found that all the silver spoons belonging to the. hotel had been stolen.
                     Suspicion fell upon the German, who, it was shortly discovered, had not been
                     home all night, and the woman he called his wife was questioned respecting<pb
                        n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7191-00000175"/> him. She is either a complete
                     simpleton, or else an accomplished swindler herself—we can hardly say which at
                     present. She began to cry, or to feign tears; and said she was a Countess, and
                     her husband was Count Von Kempenblossen <emph>in disguise;</emph> and on being
                     told that she would be sent to prison, she said further that her father was Mr.
                     M—— the well known ship-owner of New York; and that the <emph>Count</emph> had
                     been engaged to teach, her music, and she eloped with him. This maybe true, or
                     not—though, if it be so, it is unaccountable to us how so good-looking a girl
                     could allow herself to be made the dupe of such an ungainly fellow; as the
                     pretended Count, whose whole attraction consisted in his immense quantity of
                     hair, beard, moustache and whiskers, which were black when he arrived at the
                     hotel, but as red as beet-root when he absconded. At present we have only given
                     the initials of the merchant's name, as we cannot believe the girl's statement
                     is correct. Still many of our readers will doubtless recognize the party
                     alluded to, who, we expect, will immediately deny the imputation.</p>
                  <p>"Just as we were going to press, we learnt that a German woman, who takes in
                     washing in this town, has recognized the description given of the swindler on
                     the handbills, as that of her husband, who absconded from her a year ago,
                     leaving her with four small children to support. She says the fellow's real
                     name is Hans Kœnig, and that he is by trade an itinerant fiddler. If the facts
                     stated by the girl be true, the disgrace will fall heavily upon her family, and
                     the affair will furnish abundance of scandal and gossip in more than one
                     fashionable coterie in New York."</p>
               </q>
               <p>"Confound the girl!" said the merchant, crumpling the letter up in his hand; and
                  striking his hand heavily upon the table, be rose from his seat and strode rapidly
                  to and fro across the room. "No, no; her mother may plead as she likes—never again
                  shall she darken my door—never, never! She may take the consequences of her
                  disgraceful and atrocious conduct. She may drown herself, if she pleases, So much
                  the better for her and for all of us; but there's no fear of that, though. By —— I
                  wish she would. I should not have cared so much had the affair not got into the
                  public prints. In the position in which I am placed at present, it will be another
                  push down hill to ruin. And then the scorn of my friends and
                     acquaintances—<emph>friends!</emph> forsooth! I shall blow my brains out. This
                  comes of the absurd education my wife has given to the girls. Well, she and they
                  must reap the fruits of the seed she has sown. And there's that scoundrel Charles,
                  too. Old Dixon threatens me with exposure and a lawsuit, unless I compromise
                  matters, and settle $10,000 on his hussey of a daughter. I have no doubt she
                  deluded Charles into marrying her. However, I shall cut Charles off with a
                  shilling. Henceforward he is no son of mine——"</p>
               <p>The clock on the mantelpiece struck the hour of eight.</p>
               <p>"Ha!" said the merchant, "eight o'clock already. That infamous fellow, Harvey,
                  who, I verily believe, has been deceiving me all along, was to call at half-past
                  eight, respecting that cursed affair of the Widow Miller's. I wish the whole of
                  them were in perdition. It will not do, though, for the oily scoundrel to catch me
                  in this excited condition;" and ringing the bell, which the servant answered, Mr.
                  Mordant told him to show Mr. Harvey into the study if he should call, and then
                  retired to his dressing room, to change his attire and bathe his face, and
                  endeavor to disguise his agitation as well as might be, prior to the expected
                  visit of the cool, astute lawyer.</p>
               <p>When he returned, at the expiration of half an hour, Mr. Harvey was seated in the
                  study.</p>
               <p>He rose to salute the merchant as he entered, but did not speak, being apparently
                  desirous that Mr. Mordant should be the first to commence the conversation.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir," said the merchant, after a few moments' silence, "what is the result
                  of your interview with Mrs. Miller?"</p>
               <p>"The widow obstinately insists upon receiving not only the entire estate back,
                  with all the improvements that you have made upon it, and the trebly increased
                  rental, but she is avaricious enough also to demand the whole of the back rents at
                  the rate of $1,000 a year, for the entire period since the death of her husband,
                  and if this is refused she threatens exposure. It is my opinion that she is aware
                  of the whole of the circumstances attending the purchase of the estate by you, and
                  of the <emph>transactions</emph>—you understand me?" and the lawyer looked keenly
                  at his client—" the transactions between you and this Dutchman—Peyster or De
                  Peyster. She regards the latter, however, as a simple dupe—a mere tool in your
                  hands."</p>
               <p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the merchant; "must I pay back the entire rents at the
                  rate of $1,000 a year? Why, the property has not brought that rent more than five
                  years, and I have laid out thousands in its improvement; besides, surely it<pb
                     n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7191-00000176"/> should be taken into consideration that
                  I purchased the property in the belief that the claim of Peyster was good——"</p>
               <p>"Hold, my dear sir," exclaimed Mr. Harvey; "supposing you did—and (it is useless
                  to allow of double-dealing between a lawyer and his client, and I know, as well as
                  you, that you thought no such thing)—but, I repeat, supposing you did; what would
                  the court—and more than the court—what would the world say with regard to a
                  wealthy man, who, upon the decease of a poor relative, sought out voluntarily and
                  proved a claim that would deprive his widow of the main stay of her means of
                  livelihood, and then purchased, for his own purposes, the property at a low cost?
                  What would the world say of this, Mr. Mordant, even could you make it believe that
                  you really thought the late Mr. Miller held the property by a false tenure?"</p>
               <p>"Then I am to forfeit this large sum of money, or submit to a disgraceful
                  exposure? Speak plainly, Mr. Harvey, is it so?"</p>
               <p>"Even so, Mr. Mordant. You know the value of your reputation, whether or not it is
                  worth the sacrifice."</p>
               <p>"I will pay the money and restore the property," said the merchant, after thinking
                  for some moments. "But, Mr. Harvey, as an offset to this loss on my part, cannot
                  Mrs. Miller be persuaded to let it be made public in some roundabout way—not, of
                  course, openly or pompously—that having discovered, by chance, that the Dutch
                  claim, under which I purchased the estate, was not tenable, I generously returned
                  it, with all the improvements, and all the back rents, to the widow? Such a
                  report, freely but cautiously circulated, would almost reconcile me to the
                  loss."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps that may be effected," said the lawyer. "The widow will know better, but
                  she will likely be so rejoiced at the idea of receiving back the property—quite a
                  small fortune to <emph>her</emph>—that she will make no objection to throw in the
                  plaster, if it will heal the sore."</p>
               <p>"And it might be hinted, also," said the merchant, quite cheerfully—for he foresaw
                  the advantages that would accrue to him if it were believed that he had behaved
                  thus? nobly and generously—"it might be hinted that I had procured her son,
                  through my influence, an appointment in the navy, and had taken the youth under
                  nay protection, having an eager desire to push his fortunes for his father's
                  sake."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that <emph>might</emph> be hinted," said the lawyer, ironically, though the
                  irony was unperceived by the merchant.</p>
               <p>"And now, my dear sir," continued Mr. Harvey, "there is that other little matter,
                  with regard to Mr. Charles and old Dixon. The old man is obstinate. What do you
                  intend to do—pay him the $10,000 he demands?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir; I believe Charles was ensnared—entrapped into this marriage. I intend to
                  contest the case."</p>
               <p>"And lose $20,000, besides giving publicity to a matter, which, for the sake of
                  all parties implicated, had better be kept secret, and buried in oblivion."</p>
               <p>"But you don't mean to say that Dixon—or the infamous girl, rather—would gain the
                  suit?"</p>
               <p>"Unquestionably she would, and your son would have to allow the female a yearly
                  sum in proportion to his circumstances at the period the marriage was consummated.
                  Mr. Mordant, I have examined into this matter thoroughly. Your son has no
                  loop-hole by which he can effect his escape."</p>
               <p>"But I shall disinherit him. How can he pay the money then? I ought surely not to
                  be accountable for his foolish conduct?"</p>
               <p>"The world is censorious, Mr. Mordant. Is the opprobrium that would be cast upon
                  your family, were this affair to become public, worth averting by the sacrifice of
                  $10,000, or is it preferable to suffer it to fall on you, and lose, besides, twice
                  that sum? That is the question to be considered."</p>
               <p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the merchant, "these payments, added to the losses I
                  have lately suffered, will well nigh ruin me."</p>
               <p>The lawyer smiled. "Nay, nay, Mr. Mordant," said he, "I know well that however
                  annoying it may be to sacrifice so much money, the loss of twice that sum would
                  not ruin you, or even shake your credit, always provided your reputation were
                  preserved."</p>
               <p>"If it is necessary—absolutely advisable and necessary—I will pay the money," said
                  the merchant. "But," he added, "can a divorce riot be procured?"</p>
               <p>"No doubt it can, and I fancy that Miss Dixon, or rather I should say, Mrs.
                  Charles Mordant and her friends, would then willingly aid in effecting one."</p>
               <p>"Then Charles might yet marry Miss Wilson. In that case I would be half inclined
                  to forgive the boy. His marriage with Marie Wilson would, for reasons that you
                  know not of, be of vast pecuniary benefit to <emph>me.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I doubt if Marie Wilson can be induced to consent to the<pb n="338-339"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000177"/> marriage," replied Mr. Harvey; "but that is a
                  matter of after consideration, However, I have yet another affair to speak of. We
                  may as well settle everything at once. Grindley has seen me respecting that
                  threatened exposure of the affair of the Dolphin at Sierra Leone. I see no remedy
                  but for you to pay the money demanded."</p>
               <p>"The money has been paid. I trust I shall hear no more of that," said Mr. Mordant.
                  And after a short conversation on other matters the lawyer wished Mr. Mordant
                  good-night, and left him to his far from agreeable meditations. However, the first
                  blow of misfortune is always the weightiest; those that fall later serve even to
                  modify the pain and the merchant, after giving vent freely to his feelings, and
                  anathematizing Mr. Harvey and all of his class as a set of vampires, summed up his
                  losses, and at length, for the first time that day, joined his family in the
                  parlor below. The subject of the elder daughter's marriage was, however, not
                  mentioned either by the father, mother, or sister.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Harvey actuated by sentiments of generosity and justice in the effective
                  part he had played in obtaining for the widow the restoration of her property? Let
                  us see.</p>
               <p>On the morning following the lawyer's visit to Mr. Mordant he crossed the Jersey
                  City Ferry, and wended his way to the widow Miller's cottage.</p>
               <p>"I am happy, Mrs. Miller, to congratulate you on the success of my exertions to
                  procure for you the restoration of the property unjustly withheld from you so many
                  years by Mr. Mordant," said he, after he had entered the house and been invited to
                  seat himself by the lady.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible that Mr. Mordant has voluntarily given it up, without having
                  recourse to legal measures?" said the widow, almost overcome with delight at the
                  prospect of her coming good fortune.</p>
               <p>"He has, madam, and the back rents with it, $300 a year for the last ten
                  years—amounting to $3000. I could have insisted on $1,000 a year for the last five
                  years; but Mr. Mordant parted with the estate so willingly when he found that he
                  was really its unlawful possessor—(do you know that I am half inclined to believe
                  that he has not been quite so guilty as I was at first induced to think)—that I
                  thought $3,000 was sufficient to mulct him of; and as he has lost the estate, it
                  would perhaps be a salvo if the rumor were spread abroad that he had restored the
                  whole back rents, say $10,000, though for the first five Eve years they did not
                  much exceed $300 per annum."</p>
               <p>"As you please, Mr. Harvey," said the window. "I leave everything in your hands.
                  You have acted so generously, that I cannot be sufficiently grateful to you. You
                  must accept of at least one-half of the $3,000."</p>
               <p>Mr. Harvey looked somewhat confused at this generous offer on the part of the
                  widow, and the blood rushed to his cheeks; he knew that he should already pocket
                  $7,000; but the offer was too tempting to be refused. He gulped down the rising
                  remorse of conscience, and merely saying that he had been at considerable expense
                  and trouble, accepted the offer.</p>
               <p>"Oh, if my poor Jane were only alive to share my good fortune!" said the widow,
                  the tears rushing to her eyes as she thought of her long-lost child. "And my boy,"
                  she added, "I shall be able to help him forward now; $1,000 a year added to the
                  little income I now possess, will make me quite easy in my circumstances."</p>
               <p>"The G——, in which ship your son sailed, is expected to arrive at Norfolk every
                  day," replied the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"Then I shall soon see my dear William," exclaimed the delighted mother,
                  gratefully pressing the hand of the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"God bless you!" she added. "God bless you, Mr. Harvey, for your kindness to the
                  widow and the orphan. Would to God that there were more men like you."</p>
               <p>"Don't mention that, madam," replied Mr. Harvey. "I have but done my duty.
                  By-the-by, it would be as well if you did not call upon Mr. Mordant; or if you do,
                  say nothing more than you can help respecting this affair. He naturally feels a
                  little sore upon the subject; and, as I shall spread abroad the report that he has
                  voluntarily restored the full amount of the back rents, it would be as well for
                  you to make him think, should the subject be brought up, that you believe you have
                  received them."</p>
               <p>"Assuredly," said the widow; "I feel too grateful to him not to forgive his past
                  misconduct, if indeed, he were cognizant of the injustice he was doing me and
                  mine, and I am willing to serve him in any way I can. It will be a white lie," she
                  added, smilingly; one that the recording angel will blot out as he marks it down.
                  I shall assist in spreading the report of his generosity, for he really
                     <emph>has</emph> restored the rents as they were during my dear husband's
                  lifetime."</p>
               <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7191-00000178"/>
               <p>"You will be acting generously madam," said the lawyer, as he put on his hat and
                  gloves, and left the cottage.</p>
               <p>"So, so!" he said to himself, as he turned his steps towards home. I have made a
                  comfortable thing out of this business—pocketed a cool $8,500. My conscience stuck
                  a little at the window's offer, but I couldn't allow it to conquer. Now, with
                  regard to this affair with Dixon, if I can get the old fellow to compromise, I
                  don't think it will be difficult to deal with the girl. Perhaps, by writing to
                  him, and stating that Mr. Mordant is willing to give $5,000 or $7,000 to hush up
                  the matter, and will also lend his aid to obtain the divorce, which I know the
                  girl wants to produce, I may make a few thousands out of that."</p>
               <p>And, with the happy feeling that a man possesses, whose conscience will stretch
                  conveniently to any length when he has made a good day's work, and filled his
                  pockets with the spoil cozened from others, the lawyer reached his him, and
                  retired to his pillow to dream of his good fortune, and, perchance, to ponder over
                  fresh schemes of professional extortion.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WE left Seymour just at the moment he had set his feet on shore on Zuleika's Isle,
                  after his return from New York. Before, however, we proceed with his further
                  history it is requisite for us to retrace our steps and relate the particulars of
                  his visit to Camden—the abode of Mrs. Martin. The party, so singularly brought
                  together, consisting of Captain Seymour, Mrs. Sarah Donalsdon and Frank—started
                  for Camden, the day following that of their arrival at Augusta. The journey was
                  not a very long one; but during its course they found means to become as well as
                  acquainted each with the other as though they had known each other as relative for
                  years.</p>
               <p>"By-the-by, Frank," said Seymour. "There is one small link in this chain of
                  relationship which still requires clearing.</p>
               <p>"You told me in New York, the evening you were so exceedingly communicative, that
                  your father was an officer in the U.S. Army; but that your grandfather was drowned
                  at sea. His name, that is your mother's father's name, must have been Donaldson.
                  Now as yet I have heard only of the Mary Donaldson whom my scapegrace of a
                  grandfather wedded, and this lady, Mrs. Sarah Donaldson here present, the question
                  is, boy, who was your grandfather was he a brother of this lady? I have hot yet
                  heard that Mr. Donaldson of Rose Abbey had a son."</p>
               <p>"I'm sure I can't say, sir—I only know that I have heard my mother say that her
                  father was drowned at sea, while engaged on a whaling voyage from Nantucket, and
                  that her mother died very shortly after she heard the news of her husband's loss.
                  My mother had been well educated, and she obtained a situation as governess in a
                  family at Augusta, where she met my father, and whence he married her. More than
                  this I know not. My mother has seldom spoken to me of her relatives in
                  England."</p>
               <p>"I can explain this mystery," said Mrs. Donaldson, who, although very feeble and
                  still sometimes rather flighty in her conversation, appeared to possess a fund of
                  good sense, and to be a woman of great intelligence. "Mary, my elder sister, had
                  two brothers, William and Frank, both younger by several years than we; and Frank
                  was the younger of the two; William married a young lady who died in giving birth
                  to a daughter who was named Sarah, who with her father accompanied me to the
                  United States some years since, and who have never been heard of since they left
                  the hotel at which we put up in New York, in order to make a short tour up the
                  Hudson. I was in ill heath at the time, or I should have accompanied them. It was
                  in the month of August, 184—William inherited a considerable property from an
                  uncle who had declared him his heir from the period of his earliest boyhood; and
                  as our father's property was not entailed upon the oldest son, and William was
                  amply provided for, he resolved to leave his fortune, which was sufficient, though
                  not large, to his daughters and his younger son Frank. Frank was our favorite
                  brother. He was so much younger than any of us that we considered him as the pet
                  of the family, and he was completely spoiled. As he grew up, being naturally of an
                  impetuous disposition, he became headstrong and obstinate, always obeying his own
                  impulses, although in opposition to the will of his father or the advice of his
                  brother and sisters. Still we loved him, he was so kind-hearted and so generous.
                  At the age of eighteen he<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7191-00000179"/> fell in love
                  with the pretty daughter of one of our father's tenants, and acting upon his
                  headstrong impulses, he married her privately, she then being only sixteen years
                  of age.</p>
               <p>"Our father was greatly exasperated, and he vowed he would never allow the young
                  married couple to enter his door, nor acknowledge the cottager's daughter as his
                  son's wife. I have no doubt, however, that had Frank behaved submissively, he
                  would have looked over the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mesalliance</foreign> in the
                  course of time, and all would have gone on well; but Frank got into a furious
                  passion; declared he would never ask his father's pardon, and would not allow his
                  wife to enter his father's house. Our father said he would expunge his name from
                  his will, and in he heat of passion he did so. Frank wrote to me, telling me that
                  he had determined to go with his young bride to the United States, and make that
                  his adopted country, and that he should work his way out in a packet ship, and
                  afterwards send for his wife. He also stated that he always had an inclination for
                  the sea, and intended then forward to adopt it as his profession. I showed the
                  letter to William and Mary, and we talked the matter over together. The result was
                  that I wrote to Frank, begging him to alter his resolve and saying that his
                  father's anger would soon cool down. However, he replied that he had fully made up
                  his mind, and nothing could make him change it. Being well aware that further
                  expostulation would be useless, William sent him a few hundred pounds as a
                  loan—had he not stipulated that, Frank would never have accepted it—so that he was
                  enabled to take a passage for himself and his wife on board a comfortable ship,
                  and to have, besides, a small surplus when he arrived in America. He subsequently
                  wrote to us, saying that he had shipped on board a whaler, and for some years we
                  heard nothing of him. At length a letter arrived from him containing a bill of
                  exchange for the lent money, in which letter he stated that he had obtained the
                  command of a whaleship out of Nantucket, and that his wife had given birth to a
                  daughter. We never heard from him individually again; but from a foreign source we
                  heard some years afterwards that the whaler he commanded had been lost at sea.
                  Shortly after this, father had died, leaving his property to me. I wrote to the
                  United States several times, in the hope to discover the whereabouts of the young
                  widow and her child; but in vain. Again years passed; still, whenever opportunity
                  occurred, I continued to prosecute my inquiries, and at last I heard from a friend
                  who had been travelling in America that he had been told that Mrs. Donaldson,
                  Frank's widow, had died shortly after she had received the intelligence of her
                  husband's death, and that the daughter had grown up and married an officer of the
                  United States Army, named Martin; also that she was a widow, and had a daughter
                  named Sarah. He did not know whether she had any sons or not, but did not think
                  she had. William and I and his daughter resolved to come ourselves to America, and
                  endeavor to trace out Prank's child. I was so pleased at his widow's calling her
                  daughter after me, that I determined to make the little girl my Heiress. We heard,
                  on our arrival in this country, that the widow Martin was residing somewhere in he
                  State of Maine—and we were on our way thither, when my poor brother and his child
                  were lost so mysteriously. I was in ill health, and the shock so affected me that
                  I lost my reason; and for some time, even after my recovery, I lived the life of a
                  recluse, until a curious circumstance occurred, which is not worth while to allude
                  to further just now—which awakened my dormant inquiries. I pursued my
                  investigations, and thank Heaven they have been crowned with success. I have
                  found, however, that I have two grand nephews as well as a grand niece to share my
                  fortune, and that of my poor brother William, which reverts to me, should not he
                  or his daughter be again heard of."</p>
               <p>"You have fully cleared up the last doubt in the chain of evidence, as the lawyers
                  would say, madam," said Seymour. "But where are we. The stage has stopped. You
                  should know the country, Frank, since you were to the manor born.' What place is
                  this?"</p>
               <p>"Camden, by Jove?" said Frank, looking out of the window; and then springing from
                  the stage. "A quarter of an hour's walk will carry us to my mother's residence,
                  which is right on the cliff, overhanging the bay. We can see it from that hilly
                  road, which we shall have to pass over."</p>
               <p>The party alighted from the stage, and leaving their luggage to be carried to the
                  widow's cottage by a porter, proceeded on their way. It was a wild, romantic
                  country—the scenery we have heretofore described in the fifth chapter of our
                  story—and all the party being in high spirits, they enjoyed the walk greatly.</p>
               <p>Soon they arrived on the brow of the precipice, where a precipitous road led to
                  the valley in which the farm and cottage were located. The sun was shining
                  brilliantly, and the bay beneath them glistened with its rays. The little islet,
                     whereon<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7191-00000180"/> Frank had in former days—six
                  years ago—fancied himself a second Robinson Crusoe, spread its dark shadow over
                  the clear smooth water, and the young sailor was recounting to Seymour the
                  particulars of his boyish fancy, greatly to the amusement of the captain, when a
                  lovely girl, who was gathering wild flowers in the hedge-row, started at the
                  approach of unwonted visitors and endeavored to hide himself in a copse by the
                  wayside. But Frank had seen and recognized her.</p>
               <p>"My sister Sarah!" he exclaimed, and stopping short in his story he sprang to
                  embrace her. In a few minutes he led her to his companions, and introduced her to
                  her grand aunt, and to Seymour.</p>
               <p>"And this is my namesake and grandniece, Sarah Donaldson Martin," said Mrs
                  Donaldson, embracing the blushing girl. "Well, she is one I may well be proud
                  of."</p>
               <p>"What a pretty girl," said Seymour. "Frank, you have found me a cousin it will be
                  a pleasure to fancy myself related to."</p>
               <p>He spoke the truth. Sarah Martin, whom we have heretofore described as giving
                  promise, in her early girlhood, of great beauty, had grown, now in her fourteenth
                  year, to be a most lovely girl, still however, preserving her timid, retiring
                  disposition, Frank was her favorite brother, and tears of delight filled her
                  large, soft, dark blue eyes, as, her hand locked in his, she led the way with him
                  to their mother's abode.</p>
               <p>The widow received her son, now a fine young man of twenty years of age, as one
                  arisen from the dead; for, as one that was dead, had she mourned for him.</p>
               <p>A couple of days were spent happily in this lovely, peaceful home: and Mrs.
                  Donaldson seemed suddenly to have grown young again; as she sat at the cottage
                  door in the clear, soft summer evening, and talked with her niece of those
                  relatives of whom the latter had known so little. Seymour enjoyed himself roaming
                  on the sea-shore with Frank, and visiting the long-forsaken Crusoe's cave; and had
                  he had Zuleika with him, felt that he could have been content to make his home
                  here, with her for his constant companion; but his business required him to
                  return, after a sojourn of a day or two, to New York, for he was anxious to
                  complete the arrangement of his affairs, and hasten to rejoin his wife in her
                  distant island home. Mrs. Donaldson, too, had her own affairs to settle, and she
                  much wished that Frank should accompany her, promising when everything was
                  satisfactorily arranged, to return and live at the cottage, for she had no other
                  relative but her niece, that she knew of, then Jiving. Frank, it was settled, was
                  to return with her; and now that the circumstances of the family were so
                  promising, he agreed to stay thenceforward with his mother, and enlarge and
                  superintend the duties of the farm. Sarah had never been far away from home—never
                  further than Augusta—and her brother obtained his mother's consent for her to
                  journey with them, as they intended to visit both Boston and New York, and Sarah
                  was anxious to see her brother William.</p>
               <p>They set out on their journey; first visiting Augusta, where Mrs. Donaldson placed
                  her affairs into the hands of Mr. Deane to arrange, and then proceeded direct to
                  Boston, where Seymour and Mrs. Donaldson were introduced to William Martin, and
                  Sarah was enabled to spend a short time with her elder brother. Thence after a few
                  days' stay, just sufficiently long to see the the "lions" of the city and its
                  environs, they took seats in the cars for New York.</p>
               <p>William Martin walked to the depot with them to see them off; and just as they
                  were on the point of starting, he said—"By-the-by, Frank, I had almost forgotten
                  to tell you that the U. S. frigate G—— arrived at Norfolk three days since; so you
                  did not get much the start of her after all."</p>
               <p>"No," said Frank, as he shook his brother by the hand, as the cars were put in
                  motion, "the vessel I came home in sailed like a wash-tub."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Donaldson and Sarah took two seats by themselves, which chanced to be vacant,
                  while Seymour and Frank occupied a double seat, the place in front of them being
                  already partially occupied by a young man, wrapped in a blue cloak, who appeared
                  to have been travelling from some distance, for he was soundly sleeping. The
                  motion of the cars, however, awoke him, and starting up, he threw off his cloak,
                  remarking that it was growing warm, and displayed beneath, the uniform of a
                  midshipman of the United States Navy.</p>
               <p>The uniform at once attracted the attention of Frank, and looking in the face of
                  the wearer he recognized Thomas Miller, his late shipmate on board the G——</p>
               <p>Mr. Miller!" he exclaimed, "do you not Recognize me, sir? I am Frank Martin, the
                  sailor that was rescued by the G—— from the floating wreck off the Bahamas."</p>
               <p>"God bless me, Frank, how do you do?" exclaimed the<pb n="346-347"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000181"/> young officer, freely extending his hand, "I
                  recollect now, you were sent home invalided from the frigate."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Frank, "allow me, sir, to introduce to you Captain Seymour. Yonder
                  sits my aunt and sister; I will present you to them by-and-by. Captain Seymour,"
                  he added, "this gentleman and I were in very different stations on board the G——,
                  but he is not too proud to recognize me, you see."</p>
               <p>"Certainly not," said the young midshipman; "we are not on shipboard, you know,
                  now; but did you say this gentleman's name was Seymour; Captain Seymour?" and he
                  looked at Seymour with no pleasant expression of countenance.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Frank, "this is Captain Seymour."</p>
               <p>"Did you command the Albatross, a trading vessel belonging to Mr. Mordant of New
                  York, sir?" asked the young officer.</p>
               <p>"I did," replied Seymour, "and the thought has just struck me—surely, you are not
                  the brother of Miss Jane Miller, who is, I believe, a relative of Mr.
                  Mordant?"</p>
               <p>"I am her brother, sir," said the midshipman sharply.</p>
               <p>Seymour appeared to be astonished at the vehemence of his tone; but a sudden
                  recollection flashed through his mind.</p>
               <p>"I perceive, Mr. Miller," said he, "that you are inclined to think evil of me. I
                  recollect now that your sister unaccountably left her home, sometime since
                  now—just before I last sailed in command of the Albatross, from New York, But,
                  surely, she has since returned, or been heard of?"</p>
               <p>"She has not," replied the midshipman.</p>
               <p>"Dear me, dear me, this is sad news," said Seymour. "I remember that your mother
                  thought harshly of me in regard to my conduct towards her daughter. But, Mr.
                  Miller," he added, earnestly; and extending his hand again, "I give you my word of
                  honor, I know nothing of your sister's disappearance, and I was grieved deeply
                  when I heard of it."</p>
               <p>There was something in the impressive tone of Seymour's voice, that convinced the
                  young man that he spoke the truth, and he frankly took the captain's extended
                  hand. "I am glad to hear you say so," he replied, "and I believe you; but I fear
                  my sister is lost for ever—is dead!" and his voice trembled as he spoke.</p>
               <p>Seymour did not reply, and some time elapsed ere the conversation thus suddenly
                  broken off was resumed. However, Tom Miller was young; he was going home to see
                  his mother after his first voyage at sea; he was going, home in all the splendor
                  of a new uniform, which set off his person to advantage, to captivate the maidens
                  of New Jersey, and which had been purchased and fitted expressly for the occasion,
                  at Norfolk, after the arrival of that ship, and his reserve gradually wore off.
                  The conversation was resumed, in a cheerful strain, and when the cars arrived at
                  the depot in New York, the young officer pressed all the party to accompany him to
                  the residence of his mother in Jersey, Seymour was glad of the opportunity. He
                  wished to see the widow and talk with her of Jane. Yet he did not like to offer to
                  pay her a visit. The others of the party had no particular place to go to, and
                  they willingly assented.</p>
               <p>In the course of half an hour after they had alighted from the cars, they were at
                  the door of Mrs. Miller's cottage. The widow was overjoyed to see her son safe,
                  returned, and after the first transports of affection had passed, she said:</p>
               <p>"Dear Tom, you have arrived most opportunely. A lady has called upon me this
                  morning, who was on board the ship of war with you—the same by whom you sent me
                  the letters. She has come from New Orleans, She was answering my inquiries
                  respecting you when you arrived"—</p>
               <p>"Can it be Miss Herbert!" exclaimed Tom.</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is the name," replied the widow.</p>
               <p>"Miss Herbert!" exclaimed Frank Martin. "How strange a circumstance. She was saved
                  with me from the wreck."</p>
               <p>"You saved her, Frank Martin," said Tom Miller, pressing the young sailor's
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"You do not recognized <emph>me</emph>—Captain Seymour—Mrs. Miller," said Seymour
                  advancing to the widow, and speaking in a tone of voice expressive of deep
                  feeling.</p>
               <p>"Captain Seymour!" exclaimed the widow. "Yes, I recollect you now," and the tears
                  gushed to her eyes, as the sight of him called to her mind the loss of her
                  daughter. "Captain Seymour," she continued, "I exonerate you from all blame—this
                  visit itself would serve to show that you are innocent of any harm towards my poor
                  girl; but she is lost to me for ever."</p>
               <p>The party were conducted by the widow to the room where our old acquaintance, Miss
                  Herbert, was seated. She recognized readily the preserver of her life, and the
                  young midshipman of the G—— and warmly welcomed them home.</p>
               <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7191-00000182"/>
               <p>The conversation soon became general, when Tom Miller suddenly thought of the
                  mystery of the ring.</p>
               <p>"Dear mother," he said, "did you at any time miss the ring you wore, as a memento
                  of my sister, during my absence?"</p>
               <p>"No, my boy," replied Mrs. Miller; "nor could I under stand the strange purport of
                  your letter with regard to it."</p>
               <p>"Nevertheless," said Tom, "I am positive that that very ring was sent to me by a
                  beautiful girl, who we discovered residing in seclusion oh the Island of Annabon,
                  and who said she was my sister—though she did not in the slightest degree resemble
                  poor Jane, and it is equally as certain that the ring was spirited away
                  mysteriously from the till of ray chest; and what is more singular, I lost it on
                  the day we again visited the island, when not only the lady who sent it, but every
                  vestige of her abode was gone. The negroes said the <hi rend="i"/>Obeah had
                  spirited her away, and desolated the spot."</p>
               <p>The widow looked at her son with alarm and anxiety depicted in her countenance.
                  She thought he was still laboring under some fearful delusion.</p>
               <p>Miss Herbert, however, who had been listening interestedly to the conversation,
                  interfered. "Mr. Miller," she said, "I can account for the sudden disappearance of
                  your ring, though the mystery surrounding the White Lady of Annabon, is beyond my
                  comprehension. If you recollect, you left a packet of letters for me in the till
                  of your chest, the day I was leaving the G——. You were absent, and I went to your
                  chest to take out the package, which I was near forgetting. In the till I saw this
                  ring lying (she took a ring from her pocket), and as it closely resembled one that
                  I possessed, I thought it was my own, which by some means had fallen from my
                  person. I took it, and hot until I had arrived at New Orleans, did I discover that
                  I had my own ring in any possession. It is exactly similar, you see (and she took
                  the second ring from her pocket), even to the letter: engraved inside," and she
                  handed both rings to the young officer, "You may think it strange," she continued,
                  "how the letter: should be engraved on a ring of mine—that is to say if you
                  conceive it to be the initial letter of my own name, which it is—but my name is
                  Jeannette Dixon; and—I have already told all to Mrs. Miller—the ring was given me
                  by Charles Mordant, Unhappily, I am his wife. He was the cause of my going on
                  board ship. But I will not dwell upon now."</p>
               <p>"Pray, favor me with a sight of those rings!" exclaimed Seymour; and having looked
                  at them, he continued, "Frank, Miss Deane, to whom you introduced me in New York,
                  a short time since, wears exactly such a ring as this."</p>
               <p>"It was given her by my brother William," replied Frank, who seemed utterly
                  incapable of comprehending the drift of the conversation. "Miss Deane's name is
                  Jessica, and William had the name engraved upon it, and sent it to her, he tells
                  me, as a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">gage d'amour.</foreign> There is some strange
                  tale depending upon that ring; my brother endeavored to explain it to me; but,
                  really, I could not understand him."</p>
               <p>"I can explain that," said Mrs. Donaldson; "I saw the ring on the finger of Miss
                  Deane. It was exactly like one that I had made for my poor neice, and a <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">fac simile</foreign> of a ring her mother, whose baptismal name
                  was Jane, used to wear. It was through that ring I first became acquainted with
                  Mr. Deane, and our meeting led to the discovery of my long-lost niece, your
                  mother, Frank."</p>
               <p>"It was a ring, the very counterpart of that, that I gave to Miss Miller, when I
                  bade her farewell, just before, her unaccountable disappearance," said Seymour.
                  "May I ask Mrs. Donaldson, where you had that ring manufactured?"</p>
               <p>"At the store of Mr. ——, in Boston," replied Mrs. Donaldson.</p>
               <p>"That was where I purchased the ring I gave Miss Miller," said Seymour.</p>
               <p>"And where William purchased the ring he gave Jessica," said Frank.</p>
               <p>"And Charles Mordant told me he bought my ring in Boston," said Jeannette
                  Dixon.</p>
               <p>"It is very evident that the jeweller must have manufactured duplicates of the
                  ring, probably on account of its strange antique fashion," said Seymour. "And"
                  (turning to Mrs. Donaldson), "you have said your neice was lost, madam. How and
                  when?"</p>
               <p>"I fear she was drowned in the Hudson, in the month of August, 184—" replied Mrs.
                  Donaldson.</p>
               <p>"In August, 184—" muttered Seymour; "that was only a few days after I gave the
                  ring to Jane, Mrs. Miller" (turning to that lady), "was there any thing else
                  besides the ring, from which you could recognize your daughter?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing," replied the widow; "the poor creature's body was so decomposed that it
                  could not be recognized."</p>
               <p>"Then might it not have been the neice of Mrs. Donaldson,<pb n="350-351"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000183"/> who was lost about that period? At any rate, it
                  affords some hope that poor Miss Miller is still living."</p>
               <p>"I fear not, or I should have heard of her ere this," replied the widow.</p>
               <p>"All this doesn't explain how I got the ring from the recluse of Annabon," said
                  young Miller.</p>
               <p>"No," replied Jeannette Dixon, "it does not. Who she was, is still a mystery; and
                  she wrote me a letter as singular and inexplicable in its purport as that which
                  you received from her. However, she must have been possessed of such a ring, and
                  the poor creature, whoever she was, was undoubtedly insane. Pity, too, for she was
                  a lovely girl."</p>
               <p>"That she was, indeed," said Tom.</p>
               <p>Seymour was anxious to arrange his affairs, and he shortly afterwards rose to take
                  his leave, and Frank and Sarah rose to leave with him.</p>
               <p>After Seymour had wished the widow farewell, Thomas Miller walked up to Frank, who
                  was standing at the door—</p>
               <p>"Frank," said he, "you must ask me to Camden to see your home. I should like to
                  see your sister again."</p>
               <p>"With pleasure," replied Frank. "We shall shortly return home; come as soon as you
                  can make it convenient."</p>
               <p>And then, having bade adieu to Mrs. Miller, he stepped up to Jeannette—</p>
               <p>"Miss Herbert," said he, "I will still call you by that name—we must not part for
                  ever thus. You will allow me to see you again?"</p>
               <p>Miss Herbert pressed the hand of the youth in token of assent, and walked by his
                  side until they reached the gate at the end of the garden, when she returned with
                  Thomas Miller to the cottage.</p>
               <p>Seymour, and Frank and his sister, returned to New York, and took up their
                  quarters at the Astor House; and, a few days after this happy meeting, having
                  satisfactorily arranged all his' affairs, the former sailed for the Mediterranean,
                  and arrived safely at Zuleika's Isle, at which place we left him just landed, at
                  the termination of a foregoing chapter.</p>
               <p>When the young midshipman returned to the cottage, the widow related to him the
                  happy change in her circumstances, but she carefully abstained from saying
                  anything detrimental to Mr. Mordant.</p>

               <p>THE reader will recollect that Zuleika had fainted with excess of joy in her
                  husband's arms, after having met him on the beach on his return to her island
                  home; and he had borne her lightly as though she were a child to her cottage,
                  where she soon recovered, for excess of joy, although it sometimes overpowers,
                  rarely prostrates the powers of mind and body for long together, and on waking
                  from her blissful trance and gazing wildly around her, as she passed her hand
                  across her brow, as though to assure herself that she was not dreaming, and that
                  her husband had indeed returned to her, the proud young mother sprang to the
                  cradle of woven rushes, in which the infant was reposing, and catching her up in
                  her arms and covering her with kisses, she brought her to Seymour, and with a
                  bright smile placed the baby in its father's arms.</p>
               <p>Seymour received the infant, and handling it carefully, as though he were afraid
                  that he should crush its tiny frame, he stooped and imprinted upon the baby's
                  cheek the father's first kiss, and then restored it to its mother, saying,</p>
               <p>"'Tis a pretty babe, my Zuleika. How have you called it?"</p>
               <p>"zuleika, as you bade me call my child should it be a girl," answered the young
                  mother. "But don't you think it resembles you greatly, George? See, the nose and
                  mouth are yours exactly."</p>
               <p>"Are they?" replied Seymour, smiling. "Well, maybe they are, dearest; but really,
                  if you hadn't told me I should never have discovered it. I learn for the first
                  time that I have got a, pug nose—for such all babies have—and as to the mouth,<pb
                     n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7191-00000184"/> I was not aware my own was such a
                  rosy-looking buttonhole of an aperture."</p>
               <p>"You are teazing me, George," said Zuleika, half smiling and half inclined to cry,
                  for she scarcely knew in what light to take her husband's <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >badinage.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>Seymour perceived that she was annoyed; and, bending over her and kissing her
                  brow, he replied:—</p>
               <p>"Why, what a sensitive little creature you are, darling. I was joking. Like me! to
                  be sure she is, if you will have it so—eyes, nose, mouth and all—and I shall love
                  her very much because she is my own Zuleika's first born—"</p>
               <p>"But the eyes are like mine, George!"</p>
               <p>"Are they dear; let me see. Yes, to be sure they are—exactly, when they are open,
                  I dare say; but they are closed now."</p>
               <p>"And the contour of the face——"</p>
               <p>"Is yours, too, dear, I suppose—or let us hope it will be some day; for if the
                  baby grows up like her mother, she will assuredly be all that the proudest father
                  can desire."</p>
               <p>"Then you are not displeased, that it is not a boy, George? I was afraid that you
                  might wish it were a boy."</p>
               <p>"Why so, my love?"</p>
               <p>"I scarcely know," replied Zuleika, looking up, blushing and smiling into her
                  husband's face, "but I fancied so sometimes, although Jane told me that I was
                  silly to do so."</p>
               <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Seymour, now for the first time looking into the face of Jane
                  Miller—who had been standing aside, watching with delight the reunion of Seymour
                  and Zuleika, and at once recognizing her—" Miss Miller!—Jane! Tell me, am I
                  deceived? Jane Miller here I Good God! How and when did you come here?"</p>
               <p>A new idea suddenly darted through his brain, as he intently scrutinized the
                  features of the young woman; and, turning to Zuleika, he added—</p>
               <p>"Where is Henry Davis, dear? I had forgotten him. He is still here?"</p>
               <p>And he looked inquiringly at his wife, and then again, half doubtingly, half
                  satisfied, at Jane.</p>
               <p>"Harry Davis, or at least she whom you believed to be Harry Davis, now stands
                  before you, Captain Seymour," replied Jane. "But you are right, I am Jane Miller,
                  although now for the first time since I took the ill-advised, the reckless, the
                  mad step, I did, when I engaged on board the Albatross in New York, as your cabin
                  boy, you see me in my proper attire. I have resolved to keep up an improper
                  disguise no longer, let the consequences be what they may."</p>
               <p>Jane fancied that she had strength enough to go through that which she was well
                  aware would prove to be a trying or deal, but she suddenly hesitated, stopped, and
                  sinking on a sofa, she laid her head upon Zuleika's shoulder and wept.</p>
               <p>"My mother—my mother," she sobbed; "Oh! Captain Seymour, you have been in New
                  York—tell me, have you seen my mother—is she still living—and—does—does she ever
                  speak of me?"</p>
               <p>"I have seen your mother, Miss Miller," replied Seymour. "I saw her but a day or
                  two before I left New York, scarcely more than six weeks ago, and she does think
                  and speak of you; poor lady, she constantly laments your loss, and believes you to
                  be dead. But—I really seem to have fallen a victim to some enchantment—I can't
                  understand now what all this means—I surely am not dreaming!" and he passed his
                  hand over his forehead and rubbed his eyes, as if to assure himself that he was
                  awake.</p>
               <p>Jane whispered something to Zuleika, while Seymour was speaking, and then, rising
                  from the sofa, she left the room.</p>
               <p>"Am I dreaming, Zuleika?" asking Seymour, when she had gone; "can you explain—what
                  is the meaning of this?"</p>
               <p>"Jane has desired me to explain that which she finds herself unable to do, dear
                  George," replied Zuleika. "I have known—since a very few weeks after you left the
                  cabin boy, Harry, as you imagined, to be my companion, on the Island of
                  Annabon—that it was not Harry the cabin boy, but a young woman, in disguise, you
                  had left with me. Listen, George, and I will tell you all;" and Zuleika related to
                  her wondering husband, the accident which had taken place that led to the
                  discovery of the sex of her companion, and the conversation that had subsequently
                  ensued, and when she had finished the recital, she added: "You little knew,
                  George, how really a valuable companion you had found me; and now I am only sorry
                  that she is resolved to leave me, perhaps, for ever."</p>
               <p>Seymour had gazed upon the fair features of the narrator of this romantic history,
                  glowing as they did with generous feeling, and he felt how priceless a treasure he
                  possessed in her love—so pure, so exalted, so innocent, so free from even a
                  thought of guile; for well he knew that in the bosom of one less artless and less
                  innocent than Zuleika, the seeds of distrust<pb n="354-355"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000185"/> and jealousy would have been immovably sown, and
                  the future of her love and her life embittered beyond the possibility of recovery,
                  and when she added, after having concluded the narration—" And now, dear George,
                  you will not be vexed with Jane, for my sake, for she has often trembled when she
                  thought of the moment when her secret would be made known to. you,"—he replied,
                  kissing the cheek of the lovely, artless pleader:</p>
               <p>"Angry! darling! It is Jane and you, who have reason to be angry—not I, But she is
                  right, dear—it is better that she leave us now and return to her mother; still,
                  Zuleika—I cannot understand how I never recognized her. The features I how
                  perceived are those of Jane Miller, and I often fancied I recognized a resemblance
                  in the boy Harry, to some one I knew! but Harry was as brown as a Spaniard—and
                  Jane though not so fair as you, is certainly a very fair brunette."</p>
               <p>Zuleika laughed merrily—"I wonder if I could so disguise myself that you should
                  not know me, George," said she. "Jane stained her skin with some preparation she
                  had with her, and cut off her long dark hair. It is only lately that her skin has
                  been so fair, and her hair has grown to its present length since last you sailed
                  for America."</p>
               <p>Jane Miller still remained absent, and naturally enough, the conversation reverted
                  to another subject; that of their own hopes in the future, intermingled with brief
                  retrospections of the past.</p>
               <p>"And now, George," said Zuleika, who had lain the sleeping infant in the cradle
                  and sat child-like on her husband's knee, one arm thrown around his neck, and
                  holding his hand in her's, "Now, dear George, you know what you promised me when
                  last we parted, you will never, never leave me alone again."</p>
               <p>"Never, dearest—at least never again for so long a time. For the present I shall
                  take up my abode here, until I have determined upon some plan of action. Would my
                  Zuleika be glad to see the great world of which she has hitherto known so little?"
                  he asked—parting the silky hair from her forehead with his fingers as he spoke—and
                  imprinting a kiss upon the fair smooth brow.</p>
               <p>"With you for a companion—yes; or I would be happy to live always on this island
                  if you would consent to remain for ever with me. Still I should like to visit the
                  cities I have read of, and to roam amidst the fair scenes which have been rendered
                  so familiar to me in books. But only to visit them, George, with you, and then to
                  return here or to some other pleasing ing solitude, and pass my days, happy in
                  your love, and in watching over our child."</p>
               <p>"And, perhaps, other babies would come in time, eh, Zuleika?" said Seymour
                  smiling, and patting the cheek of his blushing "child wife."</p>
               <p>And so for hours they sat building hopes and laying out plans for the future,
                  forgetful of all else but themselves and their love for each other. One had little
                  but that to think of any time, for her young life had, from the days of her early
                  childhood, been bound up in the love of Seymour; but the other—there were many
                  dark shadows in the past which still haunted <emph>him,</emph> and his conscience
                  was laden with gloomy forebodings of the future—but on this evening, which
                  reunited him to Zuleika, all these gloomy forebodings were forgotten, and he might
                  well have addressed her in the passionate words of the poet: <q>

                     </lg>
                  </q> And still they sat holding loving converse until the midnight hour had flown
                  by. These were amongst the happiest and purest hours that Seymour had known. The
                  full moon, which in that clear atmosphere appears to float like a ball of silvery
                  flame midway in the heavens, shed a halo of softly tempered light into the little
                  room in which the husband and wife were seated, and they spoke in low murmurs, yet
                  strangely distinct amidst the silence that reigned around; for, save themselves
                  and perchance Jane Miller, who still occupied her own chamber, all on the island
                  were wrapped in slumber. The breeze of the early evening, which had wafted the
                  felucca of Seymour to the shore, light as it had been, had died away, and a
                  profound stillness prevailed, only broken by the whispers and low murmurs of the
                  loving and reunited pair, and the song of<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7191-00000186"
                  /> a nightingale which had perched itself in a tree close by, and thence was
                  pouring forth an occasional melody to cheer his partner as she sat patiently
                  nestling over her young brood, while the wild mournful wail of the surf which beat
                  incessantly upon a line of rocky coast, a mile or two distant from the cottage,
                  served only to render the silence of the hour more solemnly impressive.</p>
               <p>At length Zuleika, weary with watching, with soft whispers of love yet trembling
                  upon her lips, dropped her head upon her husband's bosom, and, still sitting on
                  his knee, fell sound asleep; and then Seymour rose up and gently carried her to a
                  couch and laid her down, and feeling himself that he needed rest (for he had
                  travelled fast and far, with little delay, to hurry to his bride), he laid him
                  down gently by her side, and kissing her slightly parted lips, which murmured his
                  name in response to the embrace, he, too, was soon asleep.</p>
               <p>Morning dawned over Zuleika's Isle—another day of jubilee to the simple islanders,
                  for the lord of the isle had returned from far-off lands, across the wide ocean,
                  and this was a fitting occasion for a people, so fond of innocent amusements as
                  the unsophisticated Greeks of the isles, to keep holiday.</p>
               <p>And Seymour and his bride went amongst them and distributed gifts, and joined
                  cheerfully in their games, until the morning grew late, and the rays of the sun
                  shone too ardently, when they returned to the cottage, and Zuleika sought the
                  chamber of her companion, and soon returned with a message to her husband from
                  Jane Miller, asking him to grant her a private interview, and Seymour, who had
                  been expecting this, immediately joined Jane in the garden behind the cottage.</p>
               <p>It were heedless for us to repeat conversation, the purport of which the reader,
                  who has followed us through our story, will readily surmise; but we will listen in
                  imagination to the concluding portion of the conversation.</p>
               <p>"That I was wrong, dear Jane, in encouraging hopes that I knew would never be
                  realized, I freely confess. I might have known, perhaps I did know, that I was
                  encouraging a belief in your mind that I loved you, and would one day claim you as
                  toy bride; but I meant no harm. I fled from the persecution of the host of
                  insipid, frivolous creatures, who harassed and annoyed me, and sought your company
                  because I found that you had more sense than all of them put together, and
                  partly—pardon me for telling you this—because I saw that they slighted you;
                  treated you with scorn and contumely because they had more money and wore more
                  diamonds in their hair and more jewelry than you could afford to do. I resolved to
                  let them perceive that, gallant, and ladies' man as they thought me, I had the
                  wisdom at least to prefer good sense to frivolity, and simple, natural beauty and
                  intelligence to cosmetics and paint, and tinsel adornments. Perhaps—but no matter,
                  it was otherwise decreed, and it was too late. I grieve that I should have been
                  the cause of your taking so startling, so bold a step as you did. Pardon me, Jane,
                  but I should have given you credit for better sense. I will speak plainly with
                  you. I acknowledge I was wrong, very wrong. But hesitate not to return to your
                  mother; she will receive you with tears of joy, and what need you to care for any
                  one else—least of all for those butterflies of fashion, among whom I first met
                  you. Jane, I know enough of your uncle Mordant to enable me to assert that he and
                  his are far, far below you and yours, in all that constitutes moral worth, aye,
                  and social position, too, and the world would say this if it knew all."</p>
               <p>He ceased to speak, and Jane remained silent for some minutes. At length she
                  said:</p>
               <p>"You say, too, you met my brother. Did he—did Tom mention his sister's name?"</p>
               <p>"He did, and looked fiercely enough at me when I was first introduced to him in
                  the cars on my way from Boston to New York. Jane, your brother will be as much
                  delighted as your mother to greet again his long lost sister. By-the-by, that
                  reminds me of a strange mystery which, perhaps, you can explain. Your brother now
                  holds a midshipman's appointment in the United States navy; and some time since he
                  was on the African coast on board the G—— frigate, which vessel, it appears,
                  called at Annabon, and the captain, accompanied by your brother, visited the
                  island, and saw Zuleika, Surely you must nave recognised your brother?"</p>
               <p>"I did."</p>
               <p>"Then why did you not make yourself known to him?"</p>
               <p>"Pride, shame—a singular admixture of contrary feelings forbade me to do so"</p>
               <p>"And he—how was it that he did not recognize you?"</p>
               <p>"He was so much engaged with Zuleika, that he scarcely cast his eyes upon me;
                  besides, I was dressed as a sailor boy. It was improbable, even had he regarded
                  me, that he would have recognised his sister in me."</p>
               <p>"Jane," said Seymour, after a few moments silence, "I<pb n="358-359"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000187"/> gave you a ring—a ring of singular and antique
                  appearance—a few days before we parted from New York; have you that ring now?"</p>
               <p>"No; why do you ask?"</p>
               <p>"I have my reasons; but I will not press you to tell me what became of it, if you
                  desire not to do so."</p>
               <p>For a few moments the young woman was silent, at length she said:—</p>
               <p>"Captain Seymour, I sent that ring to my brother. Why should I not tell you all? I
                  felt deeply because my brother did not recognize me, although I hoped, at the same
                  time, that he would not; and when I saw his retreating form as he was leaving the
                  cottage at Annabon to return on board the ship—for I was watching him from another
                  room of our little cottage—I sent for Zuleika, and told her that I had recognized
                  a friend in one of the strangers, and begged her to detain the party for some few
                  minutes until I had written a letter which I wished to send on board the ship.
                  There was a female with the strangers, and upon one of her fingers I noticed a
                  ring exactly similar to that which you had given me."</p>
               <p>She hesitated a moment, and then continued—</p>
               <p>"Captain Seymour, I know not if I wrong you, but I thought her another victim to
                  your deceitful wiles. I resolved to write to my brother and to her—and I did
                  write, and Zuleika gave the letters to the young woman, to be read when they got
                  on board the frigate. I was nearly mad with excitement, and scarcely knew what I
                  wrote; but I sent the ring you gave me to my brother, and gave him to understand,
                  in ambiguous language, that his sister had seen him. I also warned the young
                  female of the deceitful part that I believed you were acting. But," she added,
                  "why am I telling this to you? How can it concern you?"</p>
               <p>"It does concern me, Miss Miller, inasmuch as you have explained a mystery which I
                  could not otherwise have solved. In the first place I tell you solemnly, that I
                  did not give the ring you speak of to the young lady whom I met at your mothers
                  cottage in New Jersey. Again, your mother wears a ring exactly similar to that
                  which I gave you, which was taken from the person of a female who was found
                  drowned in the river shortly after your disappearance from home. The body had been
                  so long in the water that the features could not lie recognized; but your mother
                  recognized what she believed to be the ring you had worn. She claimed the body as
                  that of her daughter and had it decently interred, and' she wears the ring in
                  remembrance of you. It was that discovery which led her to believe that you were
                  dead. Jane, your mother believes that you committed suicide, and she did believe
                  that I was the cause of your committing the dreadful deed."</p>
               <p>"My poor, poor mother!" said Jane, "how she must have suffered through my
                  foolish—my insane imprudence; but the rings, Captain Seymour; how came the rings,
                  so much alike, to be so widely distributed?"</p>
               <p>"The jeweller of whom they were purchased in Boston, by different persons, of
                  course, had several of a similar make, although he professed to have but one, and
                  obtained a high price for them all, in consequence of their singular and antique
                  appearance. A series of remarkable coincidences has brought the wearers, at
                  different times, together, and led to many strange and startling incidents, which
                  it is unnecessary for me to speak of now. Your brother, however," and Captain
                  Seymour smiled as he spoke, "your brother believed that the Island of Annabon was
                  enchanted, and that Zuleika was an African Ariel, and that the ring was spirited
                  away from him, until Miss Herbert (that was the name of the lady who visited the
                  island with Captain P——, and your brother) informed him that she had taken the
                  ring from the till of his chest, when about leaving the G—— to return to New
                  York—believing it, at the time, to have been her own."</p>
               <p>"My dear brother!" said Jane, "no wonder he was mystified; for I was in such a
                  state of excitement that I daresay the letters I wrote seemed to have been written
                  by a maniac."</p>
               <p>"That was what Miss Herbert thought," replied Seymour, "but she and your brother
                  were mystified by the evident knowledge you had of their family affairs, though
                  your remarks were mixed up with so much that was contradictory and absurd.
                  However, to increase the puzzle, they believed the letters to have been written by
                  Zuleika, and your brother indignantly denied that she was his sister; unless,
                  indeed, as I before hinted, she was under the power of enchantment. Neither, until
                  I recognized you yesterday, could I understand anything of the matter. It was as
                  great a mystery to me, as to the rest, when I heard in your mother's house, from
                  the lips of your-brother and Miss Herbert, that Zuleika, as they asserted, had
                  been guilty of such mischievous and strange<pb n="360-361"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000188"/> pranks—for I had no suspicion that Harry Davis was
                  my old acquaintance, Jane Miller."</p>
               <p>Sad and heavy as was the heart of Jane, she could not forbear smiling as she
                  listened fax the mystifications which her letters had given rise to.</p>
               <p>Seymour proceeded:</p>
               <p>"You will now wish to leave us, Miss Miller. I shall in a few months, perhaps in
                  the course of a few weeks, leave this place with Zuleika; I intend to travel on
                  the European Continent; until then, stay with us—write to your mother in the
                  meantime, and when Zuleika and I leave the island, you shall accompany us to
                  France, and I will thence procure you a passage to New York."</p>
               <p>"I thank you; perhaps it is better that I should wait, than leave immediately—I
                  long, oh, how much! to see my mother and brother again, and yet I dread the ordeal
                  of curiosity, perhaps scorn and contempt, that I must pass through."</p>
               <p>"You should not let that fancy trouble your mind," replied Seymour. "Believe me,
                  you will meet with a happy reception at home. Why need you care what strangers
                  think or say? At all events those whose praise or censure is alone worth a
                  thought, will pity rather than condemn."</p>
               <p>"Oh, pity! that were worse than all; I could endure scorn and contempt because I
                  could meet those who looked upon me with those feelings, with their own weapons;
                  but pity! no, I could not endure pity."</p>
               <p>"You are excited, Miss Miller," said Seymour; "you distress yourself more than
                  there is occasion for. I will leave you and return to Zuleika, who will be
                  expecting me and wondering what it is that keeps me so long absent from her.
                  Compose yourself—and then let me beg of you to join us—I am going to take Zuleika
                  out on the bay in the felucca."</p>
               <p>Seymour returned to the cottage and joined Zuleika, who, as he had expected was
                  wondering what so long detained him from her side. She was nursing her infant,
                  whom, with a mother's pride, she had attired in its gayest clothing, and the
                  little creature was jumping and kicking, and crowing and throwing its little fat
                  arms about, in all the exuberance of infantile delight, and she smiled upon her
                  father as he entered the room. "Does she not look pretty, George?" asked Zuleika.
                  "Now see, as she smiles, is she not like you. She certainly is the very best and
                  prettiest baby in the world."</p>
               <p>"Then of course she must be like her father, dear," smilingly ly replied Seymour.
                  "Certainly if you think she is, I am in duty bound to think so too," and he took
                  the infant in his arms and danced it up and down for some minutes until the little
                  creature began to cry and to hold out its arms towards its mother. "There take
                  your baby, Zuleika," said Seymour, as, kissing the infant's brow, he placed it in
                  her lap, and then, seating himself beside her, bestowed a still fonder embrace
                  upon her.</p>
               <p>"Where have you been wandering so long this morning, George?" enquired Zuleika,
                  and Seymour related to her the conversation that had passed between him and Jane
                  Miller.</p>
               <p>"Poor thing!" said Zuleika, pityingly, when he had concluded his narration. "Her's
                  is a hard fate. It must be a dreadful thing to love and not be loved again, above
                  all, when the affections are fixed on one, so noble, so true as you, dear George."
                  And she rested her hand upon her husband's shoulder and gazed earnestly into his
                  face, her dark eyes beaming with love and pride. An ice bolt seemed to pierce the
                  heart of Seymour—"so noble and true" he mentally exclaimed. "Oh Zuleika, may the
                  fates never allow your innocent soul to be disabused of that impression—would to
                  God that a happier destiny, or I should say, rather, a less impetuous temper and a
                  less obstinate will had been bestowed on me, and then, with your love to be my
                  guiding star, I might have been all you believe me to be."</p>
               <p>"You look pale and dull, dear," said Zuleika, noticing the gloom that had cast its
                  shadow over her husband's handsome features, "are you not well?" "Yes, quite well,
                  darling," he replied with forced gaiety, "come let the nurse put baby to sleep—and
                  then we will seek Jane and take a sail on the bay."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that will be delightful," replied Zuleika, as, calling the nurse, she
                  resigned the infant to her charge, and hastened to prepare herself for the
                  sail.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>There were others who had witnessed the meeting of Seymour and Zuleika, besides
                  those of the household, whom we have named. Marca, now a privileged visitor of the
                  nurse, Julia, had gazed upon the scene, and her aged and seared heart had softened
                  as she witnessed the tenderness with which Seymour embraced his wife and child,
                  and the mingled feelings of love and pride and devotion with which the young wife
                  and mother had presented the infant to its father, and then, like a simple,
                  trusting child, had seated herself upon his knee, clinging<pb n="362-363"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000189"/> ing to him, as to her every hope and stay, and
                  twining her arms around him as the vine entwines its tendrils around the sturdy
                  oak—and <emph>she,</emph> had she been left to herself, would have foregone her
                  plans of vengeance upon the devoted offspring of the hated Vicenzo; but there was
                  still another, who, unseen herself had seen this happy meeting, aid she had felt
                  all her evil passions the more strongly aroused as she witnessed the ebullitions
                  of love that cruel fate had debarred her from indulging in Her heart was ardent as
                  the sun that shines o'er her native isles. She <emph>could</emph> have loved with
                  a passion that would have devoured itself with its own intensity. Her love would
                  have resembled that of the tigress for its young—it did resemble it so far as
                  regarded her own son Abdallah; but it was a love to shrink from and to be
                  dreaded—for it would have been fraught with danger to its object. The boiling
                  lava, in the heart of Vesuvius, clothes with everlasting fertility the glowing
                  mountain-side; but who knows the moment when the volcano will break forth in fury,
                  and spread devastation and ruin upon all that it has fostered and nurtured with
                  its previous kindly warmth; and her hate! her hate was akin to her love It knew no
                  softening; it yielded to no emotions of pity; it burned with the fury of the fire
                  of Hades in her bosom, consuming herself and all upon whom she bestowed it.</p>
               <p>The two women—mother and daughter, met at a late hour of the evening, upon the
                  seashore—and, at the moment when Zuleika was seated in child-like confidence,
                  upon, her husband's knee, forgetful of the sorrows of the past—hopeful of the joys
                  that fancy, aided by love, depicted in the future; a plot was maturing which was
                  to doom that young, trusting heart to sorrow, to despair, to——but we will not
                  anticipate. Enough, is it not enough for us to say at present that Zoe had sent to
                  her son Abdallah, and he was shortly to meet her at Lemnos, and then she hoped for
                  the successful consummation of a plot which she had arranged, which should serve
                  alike to satiate her vengeauce, and to place her discarded son in the position she
                  deemed it right he should occupy.</p>
               <p>"And you are resolved, then, Zoe," said Marca, as they were about to part: "the
                  sight of the young, innocent mother, so happy to be reunited to her husband—so
                  proud of the babe she has borne him, has not had power to stay your designs?"</p>
               <p>Never, never," replied Zoe, firmly; "it has but added fresh fuel to my hatred. It
                  is useless to think to turn me the path I have marked out. You are old and dolted,
                  mother: age has chilled the once hot blood in your veins, and you have ceased to
                  feel the craving for vengeance."</p>
               <p>So Saying, without deigning to listen to the ancient sybil, who again essayed to
                  speak, Zoe turned haughtily away, and guided by the pure, soft light of the moon,
                  sought the cave where she made her home, when on Zuleika's Isle; while Marca,
                  muttering to herself as she walked along, retired to the hut a short distance from
                  Seymour's cottage, in which she had of late taken up her abode.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Marie makes her Escape from her Guardian, and is Rescued by Captain de
                     Sylva.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE anger and vexation of Mr. Wilson, when he found that all his interested hopes
                  were frustrated by the unfortunate discovery of the marriage of Charles Mordant
                  with Jeannette Dixon, knew no bounds; but upon the unfortunate Marie was it
                  chiefly visited.</p>
               <p>The poor girl was closely confined to her room for several days, her meals being
                  brought to her by her uncle—who never deigned to speak to her—and she began to
                  fear that her reason was tottering. There seemed to be no hope left to her, for no
                  answer was returned by Mr. Wilson to her repeated requests that he would allow her
                  to leave his house, and endeavor to earn her own living by making use of the
                  various accomplishments she was mistress of. He seemed resolved to drive her to
                  insanity.</p>
               <p>One day, however, he came to her apartment. There was a sterner expression than
                  usual on his always stern countenance, and although Marie was possessed of
                  considerable spirit, she was so prostrated by the effects of the solitary
                  confinement to which she had been subjected, that she quailed before her jailor,
                  and, without speaking a word, sat tremblingly waiting to hear what had led him to
                  pay her this unexpected visit.</p>
               <p>"Marie," said Mr. Wilson, after having sat for some time in silence, "you have
                  given me such sufficient proof of your obstinacy and determination to oppose my
                  reasonable desires to benefit you as well as myself, that it must be evident to
                  you that I can have no further desire to raise you from the position<pb
                     n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7191-00000190"/> in which your unfortunate birth has
                  placed you. I have told you—you have compelled me to do so—that you are my slave.
                  Actuated by feelings of pity for your youth, and your ignorance of the secret of
                  your birth, in which ignorance you have been educated by the ill-judged partiality
                  of my brother. I would have hidden your degradation from you, and have wedded you
                  to a worthy young man, and to myself alone would the secret of your birth have
                  been known. By your delay—your obstinacy, you have rendered this marriage
                  impracticable—impossible; and you cannot deny that you have brought upon your own
                  head the fate that awaits you——"</p>
               <p>"The fate that awaits me, uncle! What can you mean?" exclaimed the poor girl, in a
                  terrified tone of voice. "Surely you would not have wished to have seen me wedded
                  to a man like that vile Mr. Mordant—a man who has already been married. Good God!
                  utter, everlasting misery had been mine, had I unhappily became his wife."</p>
               <p>"And who, girl, would have known that he had been vilely entrapped into marriage
                  by that wretched woman who I foolishly engaged as your governess, had not your own
                  obstinacy brought about a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">dénoûement,</foreign> which you
                  will suffer for as long as you live."</p>
               <p>"Would the crime have been less in the eyes of the world, would my misery have
                  been less," answered Marie, "if at some future day I had discovered the dreadful
                  secret? No, uncle, do what you will with me; alas! I cannot help myself; but I
                  shall ever be thankful that a fortunate chain of circumstances has led to the
                  discovery which has saved me from becoming the wife of a villain."</p>
               <p>"Be it so, poor girl," said Mr. Wilson, his passion now thoroughly aroused, "you
                  have said enough; I would have saved you; you have chosen your own path. My own
                  interests will not suffer me to dally with you any longer. To-morrow Mr. Howell
                  will be here; he has purchased several of my field hands, and, will take them with
                  him to Texas, where he has purchased a large plantation. Howell has often
                  expressed his admiration of you. He will take you with him to superintend his
                  household; in fact, to be to all intents and purposes—his—his wife. He has paid a
                  large sum of money for you, which will help partially to remunerate me for the
                  expense to which I have been subjected in educating and fitting you to shine in a
                  sphere from which you have wantonly shpt yourself out. It now depends upon
                  yourself whether you will be happy or not. Howell is a good, clever man, and, if
                  you behave well, will treat you well; but, hear me, girl; if you show the airs you
                  have hitherto done—twelve months hence you will be picking cotton among the field
                  hands on his plantation. Howell is not a man to be trifled with."</p>
               <p>The planter was proceeding with his advice, when, looking at the fragile object of
                  his persecution, he observed that she had swooned away, and rising from his seat,
                  he left the room, and sent a negress attendant to wait upon her, and endeavor to
                  recover her.</p>
               <p>The man Howell, to whom Wilson had sold Marie, was a coarse grained, brutal
                  wretch, who had often visited Mr. Wilson's plantation, and had frequently
                  expressed his sensual admiration of Marie; he was held in detestation and terror
                  by both her and her sister Louise. She would have preferred death—a thousand
                  deaths—rather than have fallen into his hands.</p>
               <p>The negress entered the room, and applying burnt feathers and all the various
                  appliances supposed from time to time to be efficacious in cases of fainting, she
                  soon restored the poor girl to her senses, and a violent flood of tears happily
                  came to her relief, or probably her brain would have given way beneath the
                  pressure of her distress. The negress had been an old servant of her father's, and
                  had attended upon the young ladies from the period of their earliest infancy,
                  until she with them was transferred to Mr. Wilson, on the death of his brother.
                  She was acquainted with the dark secret of Marie's birth, but knowing that her
                  father had made no difference with regard to the treatment of his children, she
                  had been taught to treat them both with equal respect, and had become strongly
                  attached to them.</p>
               <p>"Cry, Missey, cry," said she; "dem tears will do you a mighty deal o' good. I know
                  what Massa Wilson be a gwine to do with you. Lor bress your pretty face, it is a
                  mortal shame. If you was a brack nigger it would be different; but to sell you to
                  dat villain, Massa Howell—golly! it is too bad. S'pose your poor fader seed it, he
                  would jump up from his grave, and haunt Massa Wilson—it is a shame, Missey Marie,"
                  and the poor negress began to weep in sympathy.</p>
               <p>"You cannot aid me, good Laura," said Marie, "but I know you are sorry for me.
                  Cannot you let my sister Louise come tome?"</p>
               <p>"Oh Missey, s'pose Massa Wilson know'd dat, he would kick up a fine bobbery, and
                  sell me right off. Oh, he is a<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7191-00000191"/> dreadful
                  man when him blood is up. He say dat no pussen mus' see you but me till Massa Ho
                  well comes to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Then God alone can help me," said Marie, again showing symptoms of fainting.
                  "Poor child!" said the compassionate negress, "it be a mortal shame—golly! let
                  Massa do what he likes, I <emph>will</emph> let Missey Louise come up—golly! I
                  will Come, cheer up, Missey Marie," she continued, addressing the half unconscious
                  girl. "Missey Louise is crying to see you dese tree days, an' I will send her to
                  you spite ob ole Massa Wilson—de ole toad!" and the negress ground her teeth as
                  she spoke, and immediately leaving the room, went in search of Louise.</p>
               <p>In the course of a few minutes, the younger sister entered the room, and throwing
                  herself into Marie's arms, she said.</p>
               <p>"My dear sister, I know all; I would have come to you before, but I could not. Oh,
                  Marie, what will become of you?—and I—I shall die when you are gone away and are
                  delivered over to such a fate! I shudder to think of it. I wish uncle Wilson and
                  Mr. Howell would both die to-night, right off, I'm sure I do—and then, Marie, you
                  should'nt be taken away. We'd both live together always."</p>
               <p>Marie locked her sister in her embrace, and for several minutes the two girls
                  mingled their tears together. At length Marie composed herself. She felt that now
                  was the hour for action, or else all was lost.</p>
               <p>"Louise," said she, "I will die sooner than suffer myself to be carried away by
                  that wretch, Howell; I will escape from this house to-night, if you will aid me.
                  You, dear Louise, can obtain the keys for me, and when uncle has retired, I will
                  go forth; the cold charity of the streets were preferable to this abode."</p>
               <p>"But, Marie, darling, you will be missed and captured; and then a worse fate will
                  await you than that which now threatens you."</p>
               <p>"Captured! never alive!" passionately exclaimed Marie; and, as she spoke, she drew
                  a knife from her bosom: "I have resolved rather to die, Louise, than to fall into
                  the hands of that detestable man; if you can get me the keys, do: if not;
                  to-morrow morning shall see me a corpse—nay, give the alarm, and I will kill
                  myself before your eyes."</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> give the alarm! <emph>I</emph> betray you, Marie!" said Louise,
                  "never; I would myself sooner die than become the mistress of Howell. I will get
                  you the keys, Marie, at any risk, if I can; and, my dear sister, God bless and
                  save you. I must go now, for uncle will be calling for me at eight o'clock;" and,
                  clasping her sister in her embrace, and bestowing upon her a score of kisses,
                  which were passionately returned, she left the room.</p>
               <p>The hours passed away slowly; until at length, the hour of midnight struck from
                  the hall clock. A solemn silence prevailed throughout the house, but out of doors
                  the rain was falling heavily, and the wind was howling mournfully; a storm had set
                  in early in the evening, which had continued to increase in violence. Marie had
                  given up all hopes of receiving aid from her sister, and she had drawn the
                  dirk-knife from the folds of her dress, and sat gazing strangely and intently on
                  the keen, glittering blade. There was a slight sound, as of some one moving
                  stealthily along the passage, in bare feet. A key was cautiously fitted into the
                  keyhole of the door of Marie's prison-chamber, and in another moment it was
                  turned, and the door being cautiously opened, displayed Louise attired in her
                  night-clothes, her face pallid with emotion and fear, but carrying in her hand the
                  key of the street door.</p>
               <p>She started, and an exclamation that would have alarmed the house, almost burst
                  from her lips, as she saw her sister looking so earnestly—so strangely upon the
                  weapon she held in her hand; but the sound of her entrance had aroused Marie from
                  her reverie, and as she looked at her sister Louise, the latter became reassured.
                  She advanced to her sister.</p>
               <p>"Marie," she whispered, "I have stolen into our uncle's room and have taken this
                  key from his pockets, while he lay sleeping. Hasten, darling—hasten to fly—for I
                  must see you off and restore the key before he awakes. But, oh! it is an awful
                  night on which to be abroad!"</p>
               <p>Marie smiled a ghastly smile. "What is the rage of the elements, Louise," she
                  said; "what is death itself, in any shape, compared to the horror of the fate that
                  awaits me if I remain here? Give me the key, dear, and Heaven bless you, and
                  preserve you from the wretchedness that has befallen your sister."</p>
               <p>She kissed Louise, and took the key from her trembling hand. Marie was calm and
                  self-composed. Her nerves were strung to the utmost tension.</p>
               <p>"But you have no money, Marie?" said Louise.</p>
               <p>"But little," replied Marie. "But I need not that——"</p>
               <pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7191-00000192"/>
               <p>"I have thought of it, and have brought you my little store; take it, Marie, for
                  my sake."</p>
               <p>It was no time for words. Marie took the proffered purse and placed it in her
                  pocket, and then, embracing Louise, she said:</p>
               <p>"Farewell, dearest sister, for the present. We may never meet again on earth! but
                  I trust we shall meet in Heaven—"</p>
               <p>In the course of a few minutes more Marie was in the dark and desolate streets,
                  exposed to the fury of the pitiless storm; and Louise had returned the key to her
                  uncle's pocket without awakening him. Then she retired to her own room to weep and
                  pray for her unfortunate sister.</p>
               <p>When Marie had reached the street, she mechanically bent her steps towards the
                  Levee. She had no motive in going thither. She had not thought of any plan of
                  action. Her whole soul had been engrossed with the desire to escape anyhow,
                  anywhere, out of the house of Mr. Wilson. Now she strove to gather her scattered
                  thoughts and to form some plan how to proceed, but the more she thought, the less
                  did she seem likely to resolve upon any definite system of action. Meanwhile the
                  drenching rain had wetted her to the skin, and the cold winds had chilled her
                  frame to the very marrow of her bones. She wandered from street to street, as one
                  crazy—always holding in her hand the friendly dagger which she resolved should end
                  her misery ere morning light, if Heaven had forsaken her, as it appeared to have
                  done.</p>
               <p>The clock struck the hour of three. For nearly three hours she had been wandering
                  amidst the storm in the drenching rain, through the deserted streets. She felt her
                  strength failing her; and, at the termination of a street leading on to the Levee,
                  she sank exhausted upon the door step of an hotel.</p>
               <p>The door was opened, and a man stepped out, having been conducted to the door by a
                  friend, with whom, it appeared, he had been spending the evening, far into the
                  night.</p>
               <p>"Good night, captain; or, rather, I should say, good morning," said the man
                  inside. "You have a dirty night to find your way on board in—take care of
                  yourself. I am going to turn in, for I feel devilish tired and sleepy; and by the
                  time I wake in the morning, I suppose you will be far off at sea."</p>
               <p>"Yes," returned the other, speaking in a foreign accent, "de wind is fair,
                  although it is stormy; I sail get under weigh directly I get on board. De pilot
                  will be ready at day-break."</p>
               <p>And, with another mutual good night, and good bye, the door was closed, and the
                  stranger addressed as captain endeavored to pick his way down the steps. In so
                  doing he came in contact with the almost insensate form of the hapless Marie.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Caramba!</foreign> Vat is dis?" said he. "A voman in de
                  streets in such a night as dis—in all dis rain—poor ting! Some unfortunate
                  creature, I suppose, who has got no home but she sail die if she stay tare trough
                  de night."</p>
               <p>And he addressed her in his broken English, asking who she was, and what had
                  brought her to that desperate straight.</p>
               <p>Awakened to her senses by the compassionate tones of the stranger's voice, the
                  young girl endeavored to rise, and exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir! whoever you are, help me now in the hour of my distress."</p>
               <p>"But vat is de matter?" said the stranger, evidently softened by the young woman's
                  earnest appeal, and struck by the lady-like tone of her voice. "You is not—vat
                  sail I say? <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Caramba!</foreign> I sail speak not a little
                  too much English. You is a lady?"</p>
               <p>"I am an unfortunate woman who needs your help, whoever you be," replied
                  Marie.</p>
               <p>"Can you speak de Portuguese?" asked the stranger.</p>
               <p>"No, sir! no!" replied Marie.</p>
               <p>"De <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Espanol?</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"De French, den. Oh, yes; you is a lady—you sall <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parlez
                     Francais?</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Oui, Monsieur, je parle Francais; par l'amour de Dieu
                     prenez pitie de moi</foreign>" said Marie, speaking in French.</p>
               <p>"Then come away from this place," said the stranger, speaking fluently in the same
                  language. "Stay, will you come on board my ship—my brig, I should say; you say you
                  have no home; it is not a fine abode for a lady, but my cabin is better than the
                  streets in this storm."</p>
               <p>The voice of the stranger was so gentle, that the unhappy girl—glad to find a
                  friend in any human being—trusted herself to his guidance; fetid carefully and
                  politely, as though she had been dad in silks and satins, and promenading the
                     most<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7191-00000193"/> fashionable streets in broad
                  daylight, he led her to his vessel; and having carried her on board, and placed
                  her on a sofa in the cabin, where a bright fire was burning, he asked her to tell
                  him her story and say how he could further aid her.</p>
               <p>Marie told her sad tale with an eloquence and feeling that touched the honest
                  sailor's heart. He was a young and handsome man, and the expression of his
                  countenance, though jovial and careless, was indicative of a generous
                  disposition.</p>
               <p>"I will help you so far as I can, so may God help me, lady," he said, when she had
                  concluded her narrative. "I am going to sea so soon as it is daylight. Can you
                  trust yourself with me? If so—in a few hours you will be safe from pursuit—I am
                  bound hence to Odessa—although by brig belongs to Lisbon. You shall go with me to
                  Odessa, and when I return home to Lisbon I will introduce you to my father and
                  mother? poor lady—they will pity and help you. But I leave it to you to say
                  whether you will trust yourself with me."</p>
               <p>"I will," replied Marie, as she looked into the ingenuous countenance of the young
                  sailor. "You will not betray or deceive me?"</p>
               <p>"No, lady, never. Dom Sebastian de Sylva has never yet deceived any one who
                  trusted in his honor. He will not betray that honor now by deceiving a woman in
                  distress. I have known misfortune, myself, lady," he continued, "and can
                  sympathize with it in others; but the day is breaking and I hear the voice of the
                  pilot—sit here and dry your clothing; my duties call me on deck, in a few hours
                  you will be far removed from that villain, your uncle, of whom you speak;" and
                  leaving Marie in the cabin he ascended to the deck—having first ordered the
                  steward to procure her coffee and such refreshments as she needed.</p>
               <p>By eight o'clock the storm had cleared up, and the Petrel, Dom Sebastian's new
                  brig, was standing out to sea, under a press of canvas, and when this was reported
                  to Marie by the young seaman, she raised her hands and thanked God, and him, His
                  instrument, who had thus, almost miraculously, delivered her from her
                  persecutors.</p>
               <p>In the morning, just as the white topsails of the Petrel were fading from the
                  sight of those who were watching her from the Levee, Mr. Wilson rose from his bed,
                  and soon afterwards he went to Marie's room, to take her her breakfast.</p>
               <p>To his astonishment, the prisoner had flown. How, he knew not. She could not have
                  escaped from the windows, and yet the doors were locked and the keys were in big
                  possession. Raging, with impotent fury, he called up the domestics and questioned
                  them, but without success; and he was obliged to put up with his disappointment in
                  the best way he could.</p>

               <p>A SMALL fleet of galleys, feluccas, and row-boats of quaint construction, lay at
                  anchor off a narrow inlet of the Isle of Samos, near the coast of Asiatic Turkey,
                  at the period of Seymour's return to Zuleika's Isle. The portion of the island off
                  which these vessels were anchored was uninhabited, or rather, we should say, was
                  only visited at intervals by a horde of Greek pirates, who had made this spot one
                  of their rendezvous. A few days after Zoe had declared her intention to Marca not
                  to forego her schemes of vengeance, several groups of men dressed, in the
                  picturesque dress of the Albanians, diversified in some degree with a quaint
                  mixture of nautical attire, were strolling on the beach watching the vessels, or
                  lounging on the green sward beyond, and indulging in the luxury of the
                  narghilly.</p>
               <p>To an artist the scene would have appeared fraught with every requisite to form a
                  picture of romantic beauty, The dress of the men, who might have been some fifty
                  in number, consisted of bright-hued, short jackets, fitting closely to their
                  forms, beneath which a broad, black leather belt stuck full of<pb n="372-373"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000194"/> pistols, and from which a sabre depended, was bound
                  around their waists, supporting their white, kilt-like breeches which reached
                  barely to the knee, displaying their muscular, well-formed nether limbs, encased
                  in scarlet embroidered leggings, while their long, black locks hanging loosely
                  over their shoulders were surmounted with scarlet woollen caps, the tassels of
                  which hung jauntily on one side. A smooth, level, sandy beach formed the landing
                  place of the Inlet, although on both sides, at no great distance, the surf boat
                  violently upon the coast, which, except in this one spot, appeared to be
                  rock-bound. This, with the sea glittering like polished silver in the bright
                  sunshine, its gently heaving bosom being studded with the fleet of small vessels
                  already mentioned, constituted the foreground of the picture; the background
                  consisted of well-wooded hills, rising gradually inland towards the centre of the
                  island, rich in luxuriant, but somewhat sombre foliage, and from amongst the trees
                  peeped rude, simply constructed huts, used as sleeping places by the temporary
                  visitors, while overhead the sky formed a canopy, unclouded, and almost too
                  dazzling to gaze upon, so deep and clear was the cerulean hue, peculiar to the
                  atmosphere of the Orient; but apart from an artistic view, the stranger would not
                  have chosen to have found himself suddenly placed in contact with those lawless
                  looking men, whose bronzed features and darkly bearded and moustached visages,
                  upon which exposure and debauchery, and recklessness and ferocity had each set
                  their indelible seal, marked them as men with whom it was dangerous to trifle.</p>

               <p>"Paulo," said one of a group who had been for some time earnestly conversing
                  together; "our captain often makes a confidant of you. Do you know why our fleet
                  has been ordered from the Hellespont to meet here, on so sudden a notice?"</p>
               <p>"Not I, Marco. Not I," replied the man addressed as Paulo, who was more aged than
                  most of the party, and whose somewhat richer attire denoted that he held rank
                  amongst that lawless band. "Not I," he repeated. "Giorgio makes a confidant of me;
                  say you? The boy might well do so, for I have trained him from a child; but,
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Corpo di Bacco!</foreign> he only tells me what he
                  pleases; and I cannot ask him to tell me more out of idle curiosity."</p>
               <p>"The boy!" exclaimed another of the group. "If he were here, and heard you speak
                  of him thus slightingly, even your gray beard would not protect you from his
                  anger. Paulo, Giorgio must now be thirty years of age."</p>
               <p>"And if he be, still he is a boy to me, who have nursed him in my arms, and then I
                  was no youngling."</p>
               <p>"Truly you bear your years well, old Paulo," said Marco; "but how is it that our
                  captain is called Giorgio! He was always known to me, before I joined his service,
                  as Abdallah."</p>
               <p>"Of a truth, Marco," replied Paulo, "it is evident that you have only lately
                  joined our band, or you would know more of our brave captain's history. His name
                  is Abdallah—at least that name was given him in childhood by his father, the old
                  tyrant Vicenzo, who was a renegade from his kindred, even to his religion; but the
                  youth was discarded by him when he took to his harem a younger mistress to
                  supplant Zoe, who had for years reigned over it; and, when he grew towards
                  manhood, he abjured the religion of Mahommed and the name of Abdallah—though he is
                  still often designated by it—and took the Greek name of Giorgio. Had he his
                  rights, he would now rule over many of these islands. And yet he may. I have a
                  notion that he has some desperate scheme on hand; and for the consummation of that
                  scheme we have been ordered to quit our safe anchorage in the Hellespont, and have
                  been dispatched here."</p>
               <p>"And where now is Giorgio?"</p>
               <p>"Keep a still tongue in your head, if you be wise. He will shortly return. It is
                  now nearly a week past since he sailed to the northern islands; and he said that
                  at about the expiration of that period he would be back again. Ha! what is that?"
                  For, even while Paulo was speaking, a white sail glittered in the distant horizon.
                  "Fetch the spy-glass from my hat, Marco—the long glass, that we lately took from
                  the French brig. It was worth all the rest of the booty; for it has the longest
                  range of any glass I have ever taken from ship of Frank or Moslem. Hasten, Marco.
                  If that be our captain, it is well; otherwise, we must prepare ourselves for
                  whatever adventure is about to befal us."</p>
               <p>Marco brought the glass, and Paulo, adjusting the focus, applied it to his eye,
                  and gazed long and intently in the direction of the sail.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Corpo di Bacco!</foreign>" he exclaimed, at length, using
                  a favorite oath, as he lowered the glass. "Unless my old eyes have<pb n="374-375"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000195"/> deceived me, that is Giorgio's bark!" And he again
                  raised deceived me, that is Giorgio's bark I the glass to his eye.</p>
               <p>"It is he. It is he," he said, as he removed it again. "Now would I wager a
                  Turkish piastre to a broad piece of Spain that we have stirring times on hand. It
                  is well, for our joints have grown still and our arms rusty of late."</p>
               <p>The glass was passed from hand to hand, and all the more experienced amongst the
                  assemblage declared the strange sail though still at a great distance, to be the
                  felucca of their captain.</p>
               <p>Within an hour the swift-sailing vessel had reached the roadstead and cast anchor,
                  and a boat left the side and was sculled rapidly towards the shore by a Greek
                  sailor. There were two others in the little boat, one of whom the expectant group
                  on shore had no difficulty in recognizing as their captain, for his tall martial
                  form was readily distinguishable; but the other figure was wrapped in a large boat
                  cloak so completely as to render the form and even the stature of the wearer
                  indistinct. The boat touched the sandy beach, and in an instant a dozen obsequious
                  hands were stretched out to drag it up high and dry beyond the reach of the
                  advancing and receding waves, and a shout from the muted voices of all the
                  assemblage rent the air in greeting to their chief. Giorgio, or Abdallah—as,
                  excepting among his own seamen, he was generally called—sprang lightly on shore,
                  and then hastily returning the salutation of the sailors, he extended his hand to
                  his companion, who also sprang from the boat, with every evidence of vigor and
                  elasticity. In springing, however, the cloak fell from her shoulders, and
                  displayed to the wondering seamen the tall figure of Zoe—the mother of Giorgio.
                  Leading Zoe by the hand, Giorgio advanced to his men, who had drawn themselves up
                  in line, in obedience to the command of Paulo, and formally presented his mother
                  to them, bidding them acknowledge her as their sovereign mistress. A second cheer
                  in honor of the mother of their captain was their reply to this, and then loosing
                  the hand of Zoe, Giorgio stepped up to Paulo, and calling him one side, entered
                  earnestly into conversation with him.</p>
               <p>While this conversation is going forward, let us attempt to describe the person
                  and appearance of Giorgio, with whom, under the name of Abdallah, the reader is
                  already in some degree familiar.</p>
               <p>He was still a young man, although his appearance betokened kened a greater number
                  of years than had been accorded to him by Paulo; but this appearance of greater
                  age might have been caused by the hardships and exposures to which he had been
                  subjected from childhood. He was tall, erect, and strikingly handsome. His
                  features, but for their bronzed complexion, might have been accounted feminine,
                  but this failing was removed by their stern expression, and by the jet-black hair,
                  moustache, and beard which adorned his face. He very much resembled Zoe, although
                  the malignant passions which marred the beauty of the latter, and which a constant
                  brooding over her smothered desire for complete and thorough vengeance bad
                  indelibly stamped upon her countenance, were wanting in the expression of her
                  son's face, which was chiefly noticeable for an appearance of reckless courage and
                  stern will. Giorgio was attired after the fashion of the sailors who owned his
                  sway—his clothing, although fashioned of better material than their's, being
                  devoid of all ornament. He wore the scarlet cap, the embroidered worsted jacket,
                  the white kilt-like breeches, and the scarlet leggings of an Albanian warrior, and
                  in the belt that encircled his waist were stuck a pair of long-barreled pistols,
                  while at his side hung as crooked Turkish scimiter, unsheathed. This, however, was
                  not his usual attire, for, when not arrayed in fighting costume, he was accustomed
                  to wear the garb of a Moslem of high rank, and the handles of his pistols and the
                  hilt of his sabre were, when in this costume, mounted with gold, and studded with
                  rare and valuable gems. Though but the captain of a horde of pirates, he claimed
                  the rank of a chieftain of the Ægean Islands, in virtue of his descent, and on
                  that account, when in gala costume, he still wore the distinctive garb of a
                  Mussulman of rank—his father, Vicenzo, having been a renegade from the faith of
                  his ancestors, though the son had abjured the Moslem faith, and nominally (at
                  least it was but little else) had re-adopted the religion of his fathers.</p>
               <p>It was sufficient for his followers to see him in the garb he now wore to satisfy
                  them that the prediction of Paulo was correct, and that their chief was bound in
                  some adventurous exploit.</p>
               <p>While Giorgio and Paulo, who was his second in command, were engaged in
                  conversation, Zoe stood scanning, with a curious eye, he fierce followers of her
                  son, and an expression of well-satisfied pride gleamed over her handsome though
                  savage features, as she glanced at the muscular forms and hardened<pb n="376-377"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000196"/> lineaments of the men who stood submissively before
                  her.</p>
               <p>Giorgio and Paulo still paraded slowly to and fro on the sandy beach.</p>
               <p>"And when will the attack be made?" enquired Paulo of his chief.</p>
               <p>"Within a few days: as soon as I can marshal all my strength and reach the Bay of
                  Salonica with my fleet. Mohammed Islam, he who nay cursed parent Vicenzo, leagued
                  with to effect the destruction of Arnault, has now a small government on the coast
                  of that bay, at Tscheran-Olstock. He has long been absent in the interior of the
                  empire; but our vengeance has not slept during these years of absence, nor have we
                  forgotten or forgiven his perfidy. Paulo, he must perish with his guards. He has
                  abundance of spoil and many wives and concubines; these latter must be ours. We
                  will make the pampered women of the haughty Mohammed Islam toil as our slaves, or
                  dispose of them to others for gold, and his wealth shall go to increase our store.
                  But I have another object in view in this expedition; there lies at the entrance
                  of the Bay of Salonica a small island upon which a daughter of Vicenzo has taken
                  up her abode. She is the wife of a Frank, who has made the island his home. She is
                  a sister of mine, but I disclaim all ties which would bind me to Vicenzo. I have
                  promised my mother to seize her that she may be sold to the Turk, and this duty I
                  take upon myself. To you, therefore, after our fleet has reached that island will
                  I entrust its command, until I rejoin you. With my own felucca and its trusty and
                  well-tried crew, shall I be enabled to effect my purpose—to seize Vicenzo's
                  daughter and to make a prisoner of her husband: to slay him if he is fool-hardy
                  enough to offer resistance. Now go, brave Paulo, and impart to my followers the
                  design I have in in view; get all ready for sea with the utmost dispatch, I must
                  rejoin my mother."</p>
               <p>The chief turned away and retraced his steps to the spot where he had left Zoe,
                  where she was still standing, alone; for the seamen had separated and wandered to
                  the beach, where they were joined by Paulo, who, assembling them together, gave
                  them such information as he thought fit with regard to the projected expedition;
                  and then, accustomed to prompt obedience, they commenced with alacrity,
                  immediately to prepare the vessels for sea.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>"And who, mother, is the husband of Bedita, this sister of mine, though she does
                  not call you mother?" enquired Giorgio.</p>
               <p>"A Frank from far across the western waters, my son," replied Zoe. "You recollect
                  the young man who, while you were yourself but a youth, although then you had
                  command of these brave followers, engaged in your service, and was prominent on
                  account of his reckless daring—and at times, when heated in the affray, for his
                  ferocity?"</p>
               <p>"I do; but I thought he was slain when reverses temporarily befell us and our
                  stronghold was broken up."</p>
               <p>"He was not slain. Where he has since been I know not; enough, that he has
                  possessed himself of wealth, and has wedded Bedita, or Zuleika as he has chosen to
                  call her. <emph>I</emph> recognized, then, in the daring pirate, the youth who but
                  a short time before had purchased Bedita of me, in the slave mart at Stamboul; but
                  he seldom saw, and did not recognize me. He had paid me well for the child. She
                  was then but an infant, and although she gave promise of exceeding beauty would
                  have fetched but little in the market. I thought he had in his turn disposed of
                  her to advantage, and I heeded not her fate. But, I cannot—will not allow her to
                  reside in peace among these Islands, where, with my consent, none of the progeny
                  of Vicenzo, save you, my own son, shall set their footsteps."</p>
               <p>"Is Bedita, then, so very beautiful?" asked the pirate chief.</p>
               <p>"She is beautiful as the almond blossom in early spring," replied Zoe, speaking in
                  the figurative language peculiar to the East.</p>
               <p>The young man did not immediately reply, but his features assumed a thoughtful
                  expression. In a few minutes, however, he continued:</p>
               <p>"And the Prank was a brave and gallant youth. I would not willingly that he should
                  come to harm—perchance he would join our band; his bravery and skill would be
                  valuable. I might offer him a command, and perhaps he would willingly consent to
                  resign his bride; there are others as handsome as Bedita."</p>
               <p>"Ah! my son," returned Zoe, "you know not these northern Franks. They are cold and
                  passionless as the icicles of their native land. They feel little of the fire that
                  scorches the blood of the sons and daughters of the East; but when their long
                  dormant passions are aroused, they are more terrible than the lion of the forest,
                  and they are true to the one woman they make their wife. To ask this man to resign
                  Bedita, would be<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7191-00000197"/> to sting him to
                  madness, for he doats upon her; and think not that he will listen to offers of
                  compromise. No, no, the sand must drink up his heart's blood—and the dainty Bedita
                  must become the inmate of a Turkish harem."</p>
               <p>"Be it so, mother," replied Giorgio, "the vessels will sail to-night. Shall you
                  accompany us?"</p>
               <p>"I will. I must be present when Bedita and her infant are torn from the arms of
                  the Frank husband and father. That hour will be the hour of my vengeance. It will
                  then be satiated."</p>
               <p>The mother and son parted, Zoe retiring to Giorgio's hut, and the latter going
                  towards the beach to superintend the preparations for the departure of his
                  vessels.</p>

               <p>A BRIG under close reefed topsails, her top-gallant masts struck, and jib-boom
                  housed—the paint on her sides almost washed off—and her rigging whitened by being
                  continually soaked with the spray that broke over it—was rolling heavily in the
                  trough of the sea amongst the Islands of the Cyclades. Hers had been a perilous
                  position; for some days past she was bound through the Dardanelles, when one of
                  those gales, rare, but when they do blow, raging with great fury, had driven her
                  out of her course—and for three days she had drifted amongst the "thousand
                  islands" of the Ægean Sea, almost unmanageable, and liable at any moment to be
                  dashed to pieces on some of the numerous rocky islets, or stranded on the reefs
                  and sand banks, that so abounded there. Bat the gale had reached its height, and
                  had begun to subside. The wind had considerably decreased, and it now blew
                  scarcely more than a strong top-gallant breeze; but the sea still rolled
                  heavily—and the little vessel suffered all the more for want of sail to keep her
                  steady, for her top-gallant masts had been sprang before they were struck—and all
                  her sails were rent. She presented to the eye a picture of desolation. In fact,
                  the scene was altogether of a gloomy, dismal character. The thick, misty, gray
                  scud overhead, although the wind had abated, continued to drift rapidly. The
                  disturbed waters which had for days dashed wildly against the rocks and sandbanks,
                  had became impregnated with earthly sediment, and had changed their customary deep
                  blue hue to that of a turgid yellow, and at intervals the wind rose in gusts and
                  whistled shrilly through the bare rigging as though loth yet to conclude its wild
                  carnival, while the gulls and other sea birds flew around in circles and shrieked
                  discordantly, as if mocking or mourning—it seemed hard to tell which—the
                  desolation of nature.</p>
               <p>Wrapped in a pea-jacket, with a sou'wester on his head, tied tightly down beneath
                  his chin, and his legs and feet encased in a pair of heavy sea-boots, into which
                  his trousers were tucked, stood one who appeared to be the captain of the brig. He
                  was peering intently and anxiously through the hazy atmosphere, steadying himself
                  by holding firmly to the weather-main rigging, and by his side stood a seaman,
                  whom, to judge from the frequency with which the captain turned and spoke to
                  him—half in command, half as though asking advice—might be the officer second in
                  command; and further off, near the companion-way, secured in a chair that was
                  firmly lashed to the deck by the ring-bolts, was seated a female form, though her
                  slight figure was so encumbered with heavy boat-cloaks, that it required a close
                  scrutiny to distinguish her sex by her attire.</p>
               <p>"The gale is now over, Pedro—and it is time," said the captain, speaking in
                  Portuguese, to his mate. "We must have been driven a long way out of our course. I
                  wish it would clear up a little, so that we could ascertain where we are. We have
                  been drifting to the westward ever since the breeze commenced, and I should judge
                  that now we cannot be far off the Bay of Salonica. We want more sail set, though.
                  Pedro, you had better set the carpenter to work at the spare<pb n="380-381"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000198"/> spars, and get up new top-gallant masts as quickly
                  as possible."</p>
               <p>"Every spar has been washed overboard with the long-boat, Senhor," replied the
                  mate. "We haven't got a stick on board even to make a royal mast, let alone a
                  top-gallant mast."</p>
               <p>"Ha! that is unfortunate. We must get new spars, some way or other, before we
                  enter the Dardanelles. It will never do to attempt to pass through that narrow
                  channel with no power to set more sail than we now carry."</p>
               <p>"I should think, Senhor, that it would not be difficult to procure spars from some
                  of these islands. The Greeks would furnish them to us, I have no doubt, and cheap,
                  too."</p>
               <p>"Very likely; well thought of, Pedro. As soon as the weather clears up, and I
                  think we shall catch a glimpse of the sun by noon, we will steer for the first
                  island we see that looks sufficiently inviting. Let the reefs out of the topsails,
                  Pedro, and hoist them up. Let us crowd as much sail on the brig as possible, for
                  she is fairly becalmed in the trough of the sea; and it would be as well to get
                  the guns up from the hold, the whole six of them, and see them put in order. These
                  Greeks are ticklish customers to deal with. I don't suppose we shall have occasion
                  to use them; but the appearance of being able to show fight often keeps one out of
                  a row."</p>
               <p>The mate left the side of his captain to execute the orders he had received, and
                  the latter having apparently satisfied himself that he had plenty of sea-room for
                  the present, left his position by the weather-main rigging, and drew near the
                  companion-way.</p>
               <p>"It has been a rough spell of weather, this, Mademoiselle Marie," said he,
                  speaking cheerfully in the French language to the lady. "The Ægean Sea is
                  generally calm and gentle; but when a gale does blow it blows to some purpose. I
                  am glad to see you on deck. I have had little time or opportunity to speak to you
                  since this infernal breeze commenced, for we have been in an unpleasant position
                  here right among these islands. How have you borne it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, quite well, Captain De Sylva," replied Marie Wilson (the reader will have
                  already perceived that it was she who had been addressed by the captain). "The
                  cabin has been so close and the sea broke over the deck so wildly that I was
                  fearful, if had indeed been able, to leave the cabin; but the fresh air has quite
                  revived me. It is a grand sight, this tumultuous tuous heaving of the waters, and
                  how wild the sky still looks?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, the sight is grand enough; but one has little time or inclination to admire
                  its sublimity, locked up in a narrow sea like this, full of reefs and sandbanks.
                  If it had been on the open ocean now, I then should have taken it easy, and should
                  have brought you on deck to witness the effects of the gale when at its height.
                  But I have not rested or closed my eyes these three days, and in such a case, when
                  one's mind is anxious, being aware that hidden dangers are all around one, there
                  is plenty to occupy the attention, besides the sublimity of nature."</p>
               <p>"You must be dreadfully fatigued, Captain De Sylva."</p>
               <p>"A little. I shall be fatigued when I have time to rest; but the anxiety I have
                  suffered has served to banish fatigue, while a cause for that anxiety lasted."</p>
               <p>"We are safe now?" inquired Marie.</p>
               <p>"I hope so. The gale is over, and I expect the weather will shortly clear, and
                  then we shall sight some of the islands, and learn our exact position. You will
                  have an opportunity, Mademoiselle, of going on shore and looking about you, for I
                  find I shall have to go into the first haven that offers to obtain some new
                  spars."</p>
               <p>"That will be delightful!" exclaimed Marie, and then she choked herself, adding,
                  "but how foolish I am. If it will be delightful to me, I suppose it will
                  considerably delay your voyage?"</p>
               <p>"It does not much matter," replied the captain. "I am accustomed to take such
                  things easy, and make my time my own, and consequently the delay will not annoy me
                  as it would one who was anxious to make a rapid voyage—still I grant I am sailor
                  enough to feel every delay that I don't bring about at my own pleasure an
                  annoyance."</p>
               <p>"When shall we reach Odessa?" enquired Marie.</p>
               <p>"That, lady, it is impossible for me to say; but, if we succeed in getting the
                  spars we need, and the wind proves favorable for our passage through the
                  Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, we may be there in a fortnight."</p>
               <p>At this moment the sun shone out from the murky clouds, dissolving the mist, as by
                  enchantment, and altogether changing the aspect of nature. "Thank heaven! there is
                  the sun again," exclaimed De Sylva.</p>
               <p>"The blessed sun!" exclaimed Marie; and, as if a simultaneous<pb n="382-383"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000199"/> neous feeling of delight had seized the entire crew
                  at the sight of the glorious luminary that for three days had been hidden from
                  them, every eye was cast aloft—on every face beamed a smile of satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Aloft there!" shouted the captain, in Portuguese, to the men who were busied
                  shaking out the reefs from the main topsail. "Do you see land any where—the mist
                  has cleared away?"</p>
               <p>"Land on the weather bow!" sung put the man at the weather earing of the
                  topsail.</p>
               <p>"Land on the lee bow!" sung put a seaman from the lee-yard-arm.</p>
               <p>"By heaven!" exclaimed the captain, "we must be well up the Bay of Salonica—much
                  further than I thought. It is lucky the gale has broken or we should have been
                  ashore on the Turkish coast. Brace up the yards close," he continued; "lay down
                  from aloft, men, and trim sails."</p>
               <p>The men crowded down from, the rigging, and for a few minutes all was hurry and
                  bustle—to the eye of a landsman all would have been confusion.</p>
               <p>The brig was put on another course; the topsails were hoisted, and again a man was
                  sent aloft to ascertain whether any of the islands were in sight.</p>
               <p>"There is a group of small islands away to leeward," shouted the seaman, from
                  aloft.</p>
               <p>"Can you make them out clearly, my man?" asked the captain. "Be sure they are not
                  merely a cluster of rocks."</p>
               <p>"I can see that they are well-wooded islands," answered the man.</p>
               <p>At this moment the slight mist, which had still lingered, rolled away, and the
                  group of islands discerned by the look-out became distinctly visible to all on
                  deck. They were evidently well-wooded and hilly, for the outline of the highlands
                  could be distinctly seen through the now clear atmosphere.</p>
               <p>"We will bear down to them, Pedro," said the captain; "square the yards again. We
                  may be able to procure from them the spars we stand in need of."</p>
               <p>The order was obeyed, and in the course of a few minutes the brig was heading
                  towards the islands, and rapidly approaching' them—the wind being brought on the
                  quarter, and still blowing a smart breeze.</p>
               <p>As the Petrel neared the land a crowd of small sail became discernible, apparently
                  bound up the Bay.</p>
               <p>"What can be the meaning of that?" asked Captain De Sylva. "Those vessels are not
                  merchantmen, <emph>that's</emph> certain. We will give them as wide a berth as
                  possible. They must be a fleet of Greek feluccas 'and row-boats, bound on some
                  marauding expedition."</p>
               <p>Leaving Captain De Sylva and his crew watching, with no little anxiety, the
                  suspicious strangers whom they had suddenly come across, we, will return to the
                  island of Samos, where we left Zoe and Giorgio and his followers preparing for the
                  contemplated attack upon the fortress of Mohammed Islem.</p>
               <p>So energetic had been the pirates, that by sunset, as Giorgio had told his mother,
                  his little fleet was ready for sea; and before midnight that same evening they had
                  left the Island of Samos in the distance. For a few days their progress northward
                  had been as rapid as they could have wished; but on the third day a storm arose,
                  and as the vessels were small—and though good sea boats, unfitted, many of them,
                  to contend with the elements in their fury—they had taken shelter under the lee of
                  one of the larger islands, at the entrance of the Bay of Salonica, which they had
                  reached before the tempest had commenced.</p>
               <p>As soon as the gale had shown symptoms of moderating, Giorgio, who was urged by
                  Zoe, and who was likewise himself anxious to put to sea again as soon as possible,
                  got his vessels under weigh, and it was this fleet which had been descried from
                  the deck of the Petrel.</p>
               <p>The tempest had raged over the entire breadth of the Ægean Sea; and Seymour and
                  Zuleika, and Jane Miller, had been confined within doors, for the rain and wind
                  rendered it unpleasant for any one to go abroad who was not compelled to do so.
                  They had admired the magnificent strife of the elements from the windows of their
                  little cottage, which overlooked the sea—and what, with indoor enjoyments and the
                  pleasure experienced in watching the progress of the gale from their snug retreat,
                  the hours had not passed wearily. Still, they were glad, on the approach of fine
                  weather, to wander abroad and breathe the fresh air, and exercise their limbs.
                  Together they rambled down to the beach and amused themselves with gathering the
                  shells which had been cast ashore during the storm.</p>
               <p>At length, growing weary, Seymour and Zuleika had seated themselves in the harbor
                  on the shore, already spoken of, and,<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7191-00000200"/>
                  while Jane still lingered on the beach, were amusing themselves by speaking of
                  their future prospects.</p>
               <p>"We shall soon quit this isle, dear George," said Zuleika, "and I shall really
                  quit it with regret, although I shall be happy to go with you to any home you
                  choose; but, I don't know how it is: every place where I linger becomes dear to
                  me. There are a thousand little associations called forth which we do not feel
                  until the hour of departure draws near. I longed to quit Annabon, and yet I left
                  it, after all? with feelings of sorrow. The negroes were ignorant and
                  superstitious, and yet I had learned to love them, for they were ever kind to me.
                  I hear and read of cruelty and selfishness amongst mankind, and yet I have found
                  every body kind and good, and I have thought that if we are kind to others we
                  shall always find them kind to us. Is it not so, George—is it not our own fault
                  when men treat us badly?"</p>
               <p>"Often, perhaps, it is, Zuleika," replied Seymour; "nay, I believe that in the
                  first instance it is always so. I once thought differently; but your influence,
                  dear (and as he spoke, he drew his wife towards him and kissed her cheek), your
                  influence has created a change within me that I would I had experienced long ago;
                  I should have been spared much pain—much sorrow," and dropping his voice, he
                  added, almost inaudibly, "and much remorse."</p>
               <p>They sat silent for some time. At length Zuleika, raising her eyes towards her
                  husband's face, said—</p>
               <p>"Dear George, I have long wanted to speak to you on a subject, which,
                  nevertheless, I have been delicate in approaching, because you have never
                  mentioned it. You know that old Otho, the fisherman, who lives near the creek, has
                  been a favorite of mine ever since I have been here. The old man is so kind and
                  gentle, yet so cheerful, it is delightful to be in his society. He is poor, far he
                  is growing old and feeble, poor fellow, and can no longer procure fish for the
                  market at Lemnos. He has enough to do to obtain support for himself. Shortly after
                  you left me—the last time you went to America—I walked out with Jane to old Otho's
                  cottage. We found the old man seated in front of his door, with an old worn volume
                  on his knee, which he was perusing earnestly. Otho can read, though few on the
                  island are able to do so. He was born and educated in Athens, and was a grown man
                  when he came to this island. The volume was so large and cumbersome, the print was
                  so small, as I could see, and the leaves in many places so soiled, that I felt
                  sorry for the old man, and I said:</p>
               <p>"'Otho, since you are so fond of reading, I will send you some Greek books from my
                  library, the print of which is larger, and which are bound in smaller compass.
                  That book is heavy to hold, and it must injure your eyes to read it.'</p>
               <p>"The old man looked up from his book, and said, in his pure Greek, that Greek I
                  like to hear him speak, so different is it from the patois of the islands I am
                  accustomed to hear, that when he speaks, it is as though my books were talking to
                  me in their own fine language:</p>
               <p>"'Lady,' he said, 'I am growing old very fast, and but a few years can remain to
                  me; perhaps a few months will carry me to my grave, and all the time I now have to
                  read—for I read but slowly, any eyesight is failing fast—is all too little for the
                  study of the book I now hold open before me.'</p>
               <p>""But,' I repeated, 'I will lend you some books that you can read more easily; and
                  you will not so much injure your eyesight.'</p>
               <p>"'I thank you, lady,' he continued; 'your gentle voice is pleasing to the ear of
                  the old man. It recalls to my memory many happy recollections of days gone by. I
                  feel your kindness; but, can you send me a book so valuable as this?'</p>
               <p>"I smiled; but I bethought me, 'the book has belonged to those once dear to him,
                  who are now no more, and it is wrong in me to smile at his simplicity—worn as the
                  volume is, lie prizes it highly;' and I recollected how, when you were away, I
                  cherished even a faded flower that you had plucked and worn.</p>
               <p>"'I will send you other books, and still you can keep that volume,' I replied.</p>
               <p>"'You mistake me, lady,' he answered. 'I will speak plainly to you. You are not
                  one who will take offence from an aged man, who wishes you well. I would that you
                  would read my old, worn, battered volume, in preference to the gay, new books of
                  which you speak. Bead it with me, and to me, lady, and you will oblige me more
                  than by sending me the books you so kindly offer—books that I have no doubt are
                  good, but which I have no time to read.'</p>
               <p>"'What is the title of the book you prize so highly?' I asked; for I could not
                  help being impressed by the old man's earnestness.</p>
               <p>"'Lady,' he replied, 'it is the book of books—it is the Bible.'</p>
               <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7191-00000201"/>
               <p>"My curiosity was aroused. Amongst all the books you had brought me, George, you
                  had never brought me a Bible. No wonder; you could not think of everything—you
                  already bring me too much; and I never asked you for a Bible. Still, I had often
                  read of it in other volumes, and I asked old Otho to let me see it; and, glancing
                  over its pages; I promised, since his eye sight was failing, to come the next day
                  and read it to him, George, you should have witnessed the smile that illlumined
                  his countenance. He took my hand:—</p>
               <p>"Lady,' he said, 'I have prayed for this and now it has come to pass. Yes, lady,
                  read that book for me, and then you will soon read it for yourself.'</p>
               <p>"I went, according to promise, and on the next day I read to him from the New
                  Testament; from the gospel of St. John. At first it was dull and incomprehensible
                  to me, and I soon began to weary of it; and when I had finished reading, and Otho
                  asked me how I liked the words of his old, battered volume, I told him how I felt.
                  Then he explained to me that which was mysterious in its pages, with earnestness
                  and fervor, and with an eloquence so far above his condition, that I almost
                  fancied that he was inspired like the holy men he spoke of—and I longed for the
                  hour to come when I should read to him again. I went the next day, and the next,
                  and I persuaded Jane to go with me, and every day I loved more and more, as I
                  began to understand it better, the volume I once thought so lightly of. At length
                  others used to come into the hut and hear me read, and Otho when I had finished,
                  would explain the dark passages so easily and so distinctly that he charmed all
                  who listened to him. He told of olden times when prophets sent direct from God to
                  His chosen people, the Jews (a race whom I have never seen, but whom I much wish
                  to see), led them out of difficulties and dangers, that but for this guidance
                  would have overwhelmed them. He spoke of prophecies foretold in the Old Testament,
                  and he showed from the New Testament, which he she was written in my own:
                  beautiful Greek, how many of these prophecies had been fulfilled, and, how many
                  more had yet to be fulfilled and would be, as surely as yonder sun shines over our
                  heads, George, I experienced doubts and fears, I thought it impossible that I
                  could ever be worthy of the glory and happiness promised in that blessed book. And
                  I told old Otho of my fears and Doubts and he bade me hope and pray, and he prayed
                  with me and for me; and, dear George, I trust I have become a Christian, not such
                  as I would wish to be; that is impossible to us while on earth; but still, a
                  Christian inasmuch as I have hope in the blessed Redeemer. Dear George" she
                  continued after a pause, looking pleadingly and tearfully up into Seymour's face,
                  and taking his hand in hers—"will <emph>you</emph> not, for my sake, for the sake
                  of our baby, whom we so dearly love. Will not you, too, strive to become a
                  Christian?"</p>
               <p>Again she paused, as if waiting for a reply from her husband; but Seymour had
                  listened to her words, as though he were in a trance; he could not trust himself
                  to speak—he was unable to speak; as he essayed to do so, the words rose in his
                  throat and choked his utterance; he felt his conscience bitterly upbraiding him;
                  he saw as in a vision, the panorama of his past life unrolled and spread out
                  before him. He felt the words of Zuleika prick him to the heart; she had spoken
                  and pleaded as with the voice of an angel; but she seemed to him, involuntary, to
                  be an accusing as well as a pleading angel.</p>
               <p>Zuleika observed his emotion.</p>
               <p>"Why this emotion, dear George," said she. "I know that hitherto, kind, generous,
                  noble, as you are, you have not experienced the delights of religion or you would
                  have spoken of them to me, and loving me as you do, would hare sought to have led
                  me to love them. You are much—so very much wiser than I—but old Otho showed me the
                  passage in the Testament where it said that wisdom—the wisdom inculcated by
                  Christianity was often denied to the wise and given to babes. George, old Otho now
                  lies bed ridden; but he still takes delight in the holy book. Let us go to him
                  together. Promise me that you will visit him with me?"</p>
               <p>"I will. I will," said Seymour, in a voice choking with vainly suppressed emotion.
                  Zuleika arose and threw her arms around her husband's neck.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>At this time Jane Miller, who had all this time lingered on the beach, entered the
                  harbor with her apron full of sea-shells</p>
               <p>"Am I interrupting you?" she said. "There is a fleet of small vessels sailing past
                  the island. I have just noticed them; they are far off and I cannot tell what they
                  resemble; and away to the northward is a larger vessel steering directly for the
                  island. She looks like a merchant ship, and must, have suffered in the storm, for
                  she has lost or struck her top-gallant masts."</p>
               <p>Seymour and Zuleika, immediately left the harbor with Jane, and walking round a
                  rocky promontory some distance from the<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7191-00000202"/>
                  harbor, from the base of which the vessel had been espied by Jane, they, too, saw
                  them distinctly. Seymour at once surmised that the flotilla of small vessels were
                  bound on some marauding expedition, commanded probably by some pirate chieftain,
                  for he knew that hordes of pirates still infested the Grecian Archipelego. He was
                  disturbed at the sight, although the flotilla appeared to be giving the island a
                  wide berth, and was apparently bound for the Bay of Solonica. But the brig was
                  evidently bound for the island, and at the present moment, he felt that pirates or
                  peaceful merchantmen would be alike unwelcome.</p>
               <p>It had been calm since noon, and still remained nearly so, and the vessels were
                  making but little progress, but he anticipated the arrival of the merchant ship
                  during the night. It was growing late and he knew that after sunset the wind would
                  freshen. He resolved therefore to conduct Zuleika and Jane to the cottage and then
                  to return to the beach at the end of the promontory and watch the strangers, and
                  if the captain or crew of the brig should land, to meet them on the shore.</p>
               <p>The party, therefore, were about to return, when an exclamation from Jane Miller
                  attracted the notice of her companions, and looking towards her, they saw that her
                  gaze was directed to the extreme point of the summit of the promontory.</p>
               <p>There stood—her tall, erect figure clearly defined against the evening sky—the
                  aged sybil, Marca. One arm was raised and, the hand stretched out, and the long
                  skinny forefinger, plainly distinguishable in the clear atmosphere, was pointed in
                  the direction of the flotilla; while with the other hand she waved to the party
                  below, as if she were warning them of some impending danger; and still while they
                  gazed at her with astonishment, they heard her shrill voice chanting in mournful
                  measure some strange, rude Runic rhyme. Zuleika nervously clasped her husband's
                  arm and shrunk to his side, and Seymour's face flushed as he said.</p>
               <p>"If I were going to remain here, I would have that old witch removed from the
                  island. Her mummeries are too absurd. She has frightened you, my Zuleika. Heed her
                  not—the creature is insane." But as he spoke the tones of his voice told that the
                  superstition inherent in his nature was awakened by the strange demeanor of the
                  sybil, and he really felt more frightened of that aged woman, then he would have
                  been had ten armed men, each seeking his life, suddenly confronted him.</p>
               <p>The cheek of Jane Miller, too, was blanched, but she did not speak.</p>
               <p>"I know it is foolish to be frightened of Marca, George," said Zuleika. "She has
                  been kind to me during your absence; I do not believe there is any harm in her."
                  And as she spoke she recovered from her alarm, and loosening her grasp of her
                  husband's arm, walked by his side to the cottage.</p>
               <p>It was more than a mile distant from the base of the promontory, and when they
                  reached it, Seymour desired them to remain, while he returned to meet the captain
                  of the merchantman, whose vessel he had no doubt had been disabled in the storm
                  and who was coining to seek assistance. The Greek vessels were steering a course
                  that would take them clear of the island, though he felt somewhat, uneasy in
                  consequence of their vicinity, he did not think they had any intention of visiting
                  the island. He hastened to the beach, for the wind was now freshening rapidly, and
                  blowing dead upon the shore, and he expected the merchantman would drop her anchor
                  before he reached the beach.</p>
               <p>He was right in his conjecture; she had done so, and a boat was in the act of
                  being lowered when he turned the point. He was so intently watching the vessel
                  that he did not perceive that Marca had descended from her elevated position and
                  was advancing towards him, and she had approached so close before he saw her, that
                  she laid her skinny hand upon his arm.</p>
               <p>Seymour started back in dismay. Had a supernatural being appeared to him he could
                  not have exhibited greater alarm.</p>
               <p>"Back—back—what do you want with me?" he gasped forth.</p>
               <p>"I come to warn you," said Marca, in a solemn measured tone of voice. "I would
                  save the dove from the talons of the falcon—but I dare not break my oath."</p>
               <p>"What mean you, woman!" asked Seymour, his wonted composure having returned as he
                  heard the sybil utter these strange words. And in a voice which told that his
                  alarm had takeh another direction, he added, "Does any harm threaten Zuleika? But,
                  no; go, foolish woman, go home. I am a fool," he muttered, "to take notice of the
                  poor insane creature."</p>
               <p>"See yonder boat approaching the shore," said Marca, unheeding Seymour's words, "I
                  know not whether harm is threatened there, but strange things are revealed to me
                  in my dreams. Do you expect a visit from one who you believe is laid in his grave,
                  far, far below the surface of the ocean, down<pb n="390-391"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000203"/> in the deep waters, amongst the shells and the
                  coral-reefs of a southern sea? If you do, perhaps this is he."</p>
               <p>"But danger lies not with him," she continued: "See yonder flotilla, wending its
                  way to the northward. It is already past this isle; but, beware! Close up the dove
                  cot. Let no one see the treasure it contains. The birds of prey are abroad, and
                  they spill blood in their path, A guilty deed done in years gone by will this
                  night be avenged—unless some miracle shall stay the destroyer's hand."</p>
               <p>"Woman, what mean you; cease these foolish metaphors; by heaven you
                     <emph>shall</emph> speak plainly," said Seymour passionately, and forgetful now
                  of the terrors that had assailed him, he advanced to seize the old sybil; but she
                  fled from him, and merely repeating the word "beware!" clambered up the cliff,
                  notwithstanding her great age, with the agility of a goat, rendering it quite
                  impossible for him to hope to follow her. As she reached a projecting rock midway
                  up the cliff she turned and said:</p>
               <p>"I have warned you; but I dare not break my oath," and then immediately
                  disappeared.</p>
               <p>The boat was now close to the beach, and Seymour stood awaiting its arrival. He
                  saw it contained but one man besides the two rowers, and this man he supposed was
                  the captain.</p>
               <p>The keel grated on the beach, and the captain rising up from the stern sheets
                  leaped lightly over the bow and advanced to where Seymour was standing, a few
                  yards distant.</p>
               <p>At once as he drew near, Seymour recognized in his light step and erect form, that
                  of the Captain of the Portuguese schooner which he had scuttled off the Island of
                  Annabon. The figure of that man, murdered, as he thought, in an hour of phrenzied
                  excitement, had ever haunted his imagination; and now he saw him approaching him
                  in bodily form as last he had seen him. He recalled the events of the past
                  hour—the forebodings of Marca still rung in his ears, and uttering the cry "it is
                  a spirit; it is the ghost of him whom I murdered which has assumed a bodily form,
                  and come to taunt me with my bitterly repented crime;" he sank senseless on the
                  beach.</p>
               <p>Captain de Sylva heard the words, and although they were spoken in English, he
                  knew enough of that language to comprehend their import. He rushed to the aid of
                  the conscience stricken man and raising his head, recognized in him the individual
                  he had met and asked to dine on board his schooner at Annabon.</p>
               <p>He looked around him in the hope of seeing some one who might aid him in
                  resuscitating the fainting man, and in a few moments Marca, who, having concealed
                  herself behind a rock, had seen all that passed from the cliff, was by his
                  side.</p>
               <p>She brought water and sprinkled it upon Seymour's face, while De Sylva held his
                  head upon his knee, and In a short time Seymour showed symptoms of revival—but he
                  shuddered and shrank within himself, as he perceived that he was resting upon the
                  knee of one whom he still half believed was a visitant from the other world.</p>
               <p>Where am I?" he asked? gazing vacantly around him? "am I dreaming? Who are you
                  that holds me?"</p>
               <p>"Sebastian de Sylva," replied the young Portuguese; "but speak Portuguese or
                  Spanish, Senhor, I can with difficulty understand English. <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >Caramba!</foreign> but this is a strange adventure, and I cannot comprehend
                  it. I may well repeat your question, and ask am <emph>I</emph> dreaming?"</p>
               <p>"Who or whatever you be," said Seymour, suddenly arousing himself, "I am George
                  Seymour, and I was captain of the Albatross, at Annabon, where I met you. Say," he
                  added, with sudden vehemence, "was it not so?"</p>
               <p>"It was," replied Don Sebastian; "now I begin to understand matters. Oh! capitano,
                  but that was a foul deed; but it is past, and I saved my life, although my poor
                  fellows became food for the sharks. Why did you not say that the fair recluse was
                  your bride, and I would not have sought to have disturbed your nest. I have heard
                  of you since, for you may well suppose that my curiosity was awakened by what had
                  occurred. Had you sought to kill me, it would have been all well. I can understand
                  your feelings; but why did you extend your vengeance to my unfortunate crew?"</p>
               <p>"I am ready to give you satisfaction now," said Seymour, his passion getting the
                  better of his reason.</p>
               <p>"No, no, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Madre de Dios!</foreign> No, I have had
                  satisfaction enough, Senhor. Come, as I have said, the deed has been done, and
                  cannot be recalled. You were mad with jealousy, I suppose. I am alive, and I
                  forgive you. Here is my hand. Is that enough?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot take your hand," said Seymour, again completely abashed. "I have been
                  guilty of a crime which renders that impossible. Speak! what seek you here? Let me
                  aid you if I can, and then let us part."</p>
               <p>"As you please," said De Sylva; and, muttering inwardly, he added, "I care not
                  myself about taking your hand. I have<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7191-00000204"/>
                  come here to seek some spars," he continued aloud, "for my brig has been knocked
                  about sadly in the gale; and, as you may perceive, I have lost my top gallant
                  masts. But I have a lady passenger on board my vessel, and I promised to fetch her
                  ashore. It is growing dark, and nothing in the way of business can be done
                  to-night. Is there a house here where I can take her to?"</p>
               <p>"She can rest in my cottage. Zuleika, my wife, and a female companion are there,"
                  said Seymour, unable to repress any longer his admiration of the careless
                  frankness of the young Portuguese.</p>
               <p>"Ah, then, if the recluse of Annabon is here, I shall do myself the pleasure of
                  seeing her, with your permission. Diabolo! but I should like again to see the
                  lady, through whom I got into such a scrape. But, you speak of a female
                  companion:—was that she whom I saw here but this moment?—she helped to bring you
                  to. Where is she gone to? The old woman was as much like a witch as one could well
                  imagine."</p>
               <p>Marca had retired unpreceived as soon as she saw that Seymour was reviving, and he
                  had not known of her assistance; but he readily divined who it was that Senhor do
                  Sylva alluded to, and he replied in the negative, observing that the woman whom he
                  spoke of was an aged Greek, who sometimes visited the island.</p>
               <p>"I hope all the old women here are not like her," said the Portuguese; "however,
                  Senhor, as I find I can procure the spars I need here, I will proceed on board
                  again and bring on shore my passenger. It will be a change for her, poor thing,
                  and to-morrow I shall set my carpenter to work at the spars."</p>
               <p>De Sylva returned on board his brig, and speedily again disembarked, and landed
                  with his carpenter and Marie. While he had been absent, Seymour had had time to
                  collect his bewildered senses, and although he could not imagine <emph>how</emph>
                  Captain De Sylva had escaped from the destruction he had sought. to wreak upon him
                  and his crew, he became convinced that it really was he in <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >propria persona,</foreign> and not his wraith that he had seen, and he felt a
                  strange sensation of relief in the knowledge that one man, at least, had escaped
                  the demoniacal vengeance which, from the very hour the dark deed had been
                  consummated, he had constantly and bitterly regretted. "And if one," he thought,
                  "why not all?" And he uttered aloud, "Oh, God! would that such were the case. Oh,
                  that the weight of this dark deed of guilt, at least, were lifted from my soul!"
                  But ere the last cadence had fallen from his lips, a voice above him exclaimed in
                  Romaic (in that language had <emph>he</emph> spoken) "He that soweth the wind
                  reapeth the whirlwind, Man, blood alone can efface the stains from the band of him
                  who hath shed blood. But why talk you <emph>of</emph> remorse? Are you the only
                  one who pineth and withereth beneath the curse that a mis-spent life bringeth? Ha,
                  ha, ha! you will have good companionship, and a merry time awaits us in the dark
                  shades of Hades. We shall be jovial together. "There was a bitter mockery in the
                  taunting laugh with which these words had been accompanied. It was Marca, who
                  spoke from the rock above, but Seymour's senses had been so confused, his mind so
                  bewildered, that he did not recognize the voice, and to him it seemed as though
                  some supernatural and ill-omened being were taunting him. He stood, vacantly
                  gazing into the mid-air—strange feelings of superstition rapidly gaining the
                  mastery over him—when again he heard the voice chanting in a monotonous tone a
                  string of Romaic verses, which may be translated as follows: <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">

               <p>Again and again were these rude, uncouth verses repeated, and for some time
                  Seymour stood spell-bound—rooted to the spot. But at length he seemed to recollect
                  himself, and to recognize<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7191-00000205"/> cognize the
                  voice; and with a laugh of contempt at his own superstitious fancies, he said:</p>
               <p>"Psha! it is that old, insane Marca, chanting forth her doleful ditties from the
                  cliff above me. What folly, to allow these superstitious feelings to overpower
                  me."</p>
               <p>He directed his gaze towards the brig. The boat had left her side, and was
                  approaching the shore, and he drew nearer to the landing-place in time to assist
                  the lady whom De Sylva had spoken of on shore, and to welcome her to the
                  island.</p>
               <p>Marie was delighted once again to set her feet, though only temporarily, upon
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">terra firma,</foreign> and Seymour invited her and her
                  companion to the cottage where he and Zuleika dwelt.</p>
               <p>On his way he said to De Sylva—</p>
               <p>"Zuleika believes that you suddenly left the island of Anna bon with your
                  schooner"—</p>
               <p>"I understand you," replied De Sylva. "I shall keep a still tongue."</p>
               <p>Seymour walked to the cottage in a gloomy mood, observing which, and divining its
                  cause, De Sylva generously sought by every means in his power to set his mind at
                  ease—and by his gay conversation had pretty well succeeded in banishing the dark
                  cloud ere they arrived at the cottage—although the latent superstition in
                  Seymour's mind was again partially aroused, as casting his eyes towards the
                  promontory, he saw the tall form of Marca, her right arm and hand stretched out,
                  and her finger pointing to a fiery cloud that was apparently just rising from the
                  horizon. But he shook off the superstitious fear, and muttered to himself—</p>
               <p>"Psha! it is but an evening cloud, and the blood-red tint is caused by the
                  reflection upon it of the rays of the setting sun."</p>
               <p>They arrived at the cottage, and Zuleika came out to meet them.</p>
               <p>"I have brought you visitors, darling," said Seymour, "one of whom I think you
                  will recognize. It is Captain De Sylva, of the Portuguese schooner which visited
                  Annabon."</p>
               <p>"I do recognize and welcome Captain De Sylva," replied Zuleika, at the same time
                  extending her hand to, him. The gallant young Portuguese respectfully raised the
                  fair hand to his lips and kissed it; and then Zuleika embraced Marie, and welcomed
                  her to the cottage and to the island. The females retired, and the young mother
                  proudly showed her babe to her visitor, and acquainted Jane Seymour with the name
                  of their unexpected visitor.</p>
               <p>Jane had been equally ignorant as Zuleika with regard to the cause of the sudden
                  disappearance of the schooner from Annabon, and only thinking it a strange
                  coincidence that they should so singularly meet again, she expressed her desire
                  not to see him, as an interview must necessarily lead to an explanation with
                  regard to her former disguise, which would be painful to her delicacy.</p>
               <p>Seymour and De Sylva spent the remainder of the evening together, until the hour
                  of retiring arrived, when Marie was Invited to share Jane's bed with her, and
                  Zuleika provided a couch for De Sylva to repose upon. Then she and her husband
                  retired to their own room, but not to rest; the night was clear and starlight, and
                  the heavens were free from clouds, save the small, dark, fiery, ill-omened shadow,
                  "scarcely larger than a man's hand," which still hovered in the western horizon;
                  and although at any other time it would not have attracted Seymour's attention,
                  now, in conjunction with the events of the last few hours, and the mystical
                  warning of the ancient sibyl, Marca, it created an indefinable sensation of
                  dread—a feeling of terror with regard to some lurking danger that he would not
                  avert, nor fairly meet, since he knew not from what quarter it would assail
                  him—that he could not shake it off, notwithstanding his reason told him it were
                  folly thus to allow Ms superstitious feelings to work upon his imagination.</p>
               <p>Zuleika was not sleepy, and she drew the cot in whisk her babe was reposing to a
                  seat near the window of the chamber, and seated herself beside her husband on the
                  sofa.</p>
               <p>Both were for some moments silent. Zuleika was admiring the calm beauty of the
                  waters of the ocean, which lay spread out before her, smooth as a polished mirror,
                  and reflecting the moon and the myriads of stars in its clear, dark depths; and
                  Seymour seemed also to be gazing at the same object, but in reality his eyes were
                  fixed on vacancy, and busy thoughts—gloomy forebodings of evil—were active within
                  his breast.</p>
               <p>At length Zuleika turned from looking upon the glorious moonlit landscape, and
                  directed her gaze upon an object far more beautiful and glorious to a mother's
                  eye—the sweet, placid features, and fat, dimpled arms of her babe, as it lay
                  quietly sleeping in the cot beside her.</p>
               <p>She touched Seymour's arm.</p>
               <p>"Does she not look like a little angel, George?" she said—"see how she smiles in
                  her sleep—and look! how tightly her little hand clasped my finger as soon as I
                  touched it." The<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC7191-00000206"/> child awoke as she
                  uttered these words, and looking up with her large, round, blue eyes, smiled upon
                  her mother, for she was already old enough to know her, and used all her little
                  efforts to raise herself up, holding out her arms and kicking her feet from
                  beneath the snowy coverlid. Zuleika snatched her up and kissing her cheeks,
                  pressed her to her bosom.</p>
               <p>Seymour was looking on with mingled emotions of conjugal and paternal pride and
                  affection. His gloomy thoughts were for the time being banished.</p>
               <p>"Had ever husband or father more reason to be grateful for such a wife and child,"
                  he thought, and placing his arm round Zuleika's waist, he affectionately embraced
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Darling," said he, "the babe promises to become as lovely as yourself; if she be
                  only as good and pure and true, I shall, indeed, have reason to be proud and
                  grateful."</p>
               <p>"And you will be grateful to the donor of this precious gift, George, will you
                  not? You will recollect what you promised me to-day. We will go together and see
                  old Otho—and, George, you will strive to become a Christian, not only in name but
                  in reality, for mine and baby's sake."</p>
               <p>"I will, dearest. We will go to-morrow. Old Otho must be provided for before we
                  leave this island."</p>
               <p>"Which will be"——</p>
               <p>"Soon as possible, dear," said Seymour, interrupting his wife, who at this moment
                  was engaged with the child, and did not observe the strange expression that came
                  over his features as he uttered these words—an expression of mingled doubt and
                  fear, as, though he dreaded some immediately-impending calamity. And he relapsed
                  into his previous gloomy reverie.</p>
               <p>Zulefka looked up; and, noticing the gloom upon her husband's brow, she said in
                  accents of tenderness—</p>
               <p>"You seem dull and melancholy, George; has anything happened to disturb you? Are
                  you unwell?"</p>
               <p>"No, dear; I am quite well, but I do feel dull to-night, and yet I know not why I
                  should do so. Come, let us seek our repose. Sleep will set me all to rights again.
                  And to-morrow we will see Otho, and make some arrangement for the old man's
                  comfort for the rest of his days. And Zuleika, dear, when we get to Prance, I will
                  purchase you the Bible you so much wish for; and when we are settled in some
                  happy, retired home, we will read and study it together, and you shall teach me
                  how to become a Christian."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that will be delightful!" exclaimed Zuleika, with all the artlessness and
                  glee of a child. "And, dear George, I am so proud of you for promising to save
                  Otho from want during the rest of his life, although it is just like you. Do you
                  know, George, I believe the poor old man has often wanted food, though he never
                  told me so; but I once noticed the bareness of his cupboard, and have carried
                  provisions to him, and his eager looks as he took it from my hands, spoke more
                  than words. Since that day I have taken care, at least, that his daily wants were
                  provided for, and he has been so thankful. He has not said much, but I have seen
                  the tears glistening in his eyes, and felt the pressure of his hand, and watched
                  his trembling lips as he murmured his prayer of gratitude to the God he endeavors
                  to serve for sending him relief through me. Oh, George, it is a happy and a
                  blessed thing to be the almoner of God's bounty."</p>
               <p>"And may God bless <emph>you,</emph> darling," was Seymour's reply, as again,
                  tenderly embracing her, he commenced to prepare himself for his night's
                  repose.</p>
               <p>Zuleika knelt to pray; she had always been in the practice of doing so since she
                  had first entered the convent school at Grenada; but this night, for the first
                  time since he had knelt, when a little boy, at his mother's knee, and repeated his
                  prayers after her, Seymour joined Zuleika in her prayers.</p>
               <p>For two hours all had been silent in the cottage. Its inmates were all soundly
                  sleeping. It was past the midnight hour—and the moon had set beneath the waters,
                  and it had become comparatively dark, although the stars still shone brightly, and
                  the horizon still remained clear—save the fiery cloud already spoken of which had
                  considerably increased in size and arising upwards from the horizon, now seemed to
                  be gradually approaching the cottage.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The fleet of vessels which had been descried in the early part of the evening
                  sailing past the island, were no longer visible. They had entered the bay, and
                  borne upwards with a fair wind, were making rapid progress towards the coast,
                  under the jurisdiction of the unsuspecting Mohammed Islam. All but one; that one
                  was the felucca, commanded in person by Giorgio, or Abdallah—and Zoe was on board
                  with her son.</p>
               <p>This vessel had sailed past the island, and then, separating from the fleet,
                  Giorgio had hauled the wind closely, and stood again towards it, under easy sail,
                  being apparently not anxious to approach too close, until after nightfall. The
                  wind, too, had<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7191-00000207"/> become light, and it was
                  past the midnight hour when Giorgio cast anchor in the haven opposite to the
                  cottage where Seymour and Zuleika resided.</p>
               <p>The Portuguese brig was in the harbor, and Giorgio as well as Zoe, were somewhat
                  disconcerted on perceiving it.</p>
               <p>The former having ordered a boat to be lowered, pulled alongside, and, hailing the
                  brig, inquired if the captain was on board. He was answered in the negative, being
                  told that he had gone on shore with a passenger, and was stopping on the island
                  for the night.</p>
               <p>"What has brought you to this island?" demanded Giorgio of the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">contremaistre.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"We have lost our spars in the gale, as you may perceive," replied the mate; "and
                  have come hither to seek for others. The carpenter is going on shore in the
                  morning to pick some out."</p>
               <p>Various other questions were put and replied to, and seemingly satisfied, the
                  pirate chief left the side, greatly to the relief of the honest Portuguese mate,
                  who did not, by half, like the proximity of the suspicious-looking Greek
                  vessel.</p>
               <p>Giorgio returned on board.</p>
               <p>"It is the brig we saw in the morning, which has come in here disabled," he said.
                  "It has happened rather inopportunely for our plans, since the captain is on
                  shore, and I see, besides, that the brig carries six guns."</p>
               <p>."Nevertheless," returned Zoe, "our purpose must be effected. And you—you are not
                  so cowardly as to fear the rusty guns of a merchantman, which will perhaps burst
                  in the discharge—and which at all events are in general pretty harmless in their
                  effects," and she laughed contemptuously and deridingly as she spoke.</p>
               <p>"I am not afraid," replied Giorgio, "and whatever man dares to do, dare I.
                  Nevertheless, it were well if this brig was out of the way. Her commander is on
                  shore, and we may find more resistance than we anticipated."</p>
               <p>"And if we do, those who oppose us must die," replied Zoe. "How long have you
                  grown dainty in your trade, and sought to spare human blood, when your purpose
                  demanded that it should be shed?"</p>
               <p>"Nay, mother," said Giorgio, "taunt me not with cowardice, for you know that I
                  know not what it is; and as to spilling blood—I have never quailed from it when it
                  has been necessary. Still, I would avoid useless carnage; nor was I aware that it
                  was your purpose to shed blood, unless it were necessary in our own defence."</p>
               <p>"Nor is it," replied Zoe, fiercely; "but every one who lifts a hand to oppose us
                  must be smitten mercilessly to the earth. The Frank and the stranger who is with
                  him—even Bedita herself must die, if she cannot be brought off alive. But I wish
                  her to live, with her child. I wish to witness the anguish of the mother, when the
                  child is taken from her, and she is exposed for sale in the slave mart. I wish to
                  have full and complete vengeance, and the hour so long sought for has arrived. I
                  wish to see Leila's child experience all the anguish that I felt when her mother's
                  baby charms caused my lord to spurn me and to disown my son. Think of this,
                  Abdallah. Think that this minion's mother was the slave who caused you to be cast
                  off, and your birthright to be reft from you. Think of this, son of mine, and let
                  the thought steel your heart, and nerve your arm to vengeance."</p>
               <p>Zoe knew that she had touched the right chord. The eyes of the young man glistened
                  with rage as his mother recalled to his recollection the history of the wrongs in
                  which he had been schooled from his earliest youth, and drawing his scimitar, and
                  raising his right arm on high, he made the sign of the Greek cross on his breast
                  with the left, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"I swear vengeance, implacable vengeance, upon the descendants of Vicenzo and
                  Leila!"</p>
               <p>"Enough, enough, my son," said Zoe. "Now let us arrange our plan of action."</p>
               <p>The mother and son conferred together. What was the purport of their conversation
                  may best be learned by that which followed.</p>
               <p>Half an hour afterwards two boats with wild-looking men left the side of the
                  felucca, and in the stern sheets of the foremost one were seated Giorgio and
                  Zoe.</p>
               <p>Could any one have watched the countenance of Zoe, as the boat was pulled on shore
                  on that eventful night, he could not have helped being struck with its dark,
                  strange expression; yet it was a handsome face. Zoe was beautiful still, although
                  she had long passed the period of life when the beauty of most women wanes, even
                  the beauty of those born and nurtured in more northern climes, and daughters of a
                  colder race. She had reached the period of life when amongst the daughters of the
                  South, the peerless charms which have called forth the adoration of the poet, and
                  have imbued the brush of the painter<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7191-00000208"/>
                  and the chisel of the sculptor with the spirit of inspiration Have, in a great
                  majority of cases, passed away, "and left no sign; the blooming maiden has blushed
                  and blossomed into the comely matron; Hebe has ripened into Juno, and for a few
                  years—a very few years—Juno has reigned the queen of majesty and grace; then has
                  come the autumn—the fall of the leaf—not slowly and gently subsiding into winter,
                  but its waning charms withering with the rapidity of a plucked flower scorching
                  beneath the rays of a summer sun. Of the Hebe of but ten years ago—of the Juno of
                  but half that period—there remains a toothless, wrinkled hag, in whose complexion
                  of mahogany, and in whose wrinkled and shrunken features, not a vestige can be
                  traced of the elegance and grace that but comparatively a short time before might
                  have charmed the cold heart of an anchorite. Even the voice—the gentle voice that
                  thing so sweet in woman—has changed; no longer lowly, gently, slowly does it
                  plead, and plead but to conquer the sterner sex—no longer is it heard in bursts of
                  musical laughter, compared with which the sweetest artistic sounds are
                  in-harmonious—but harsh and cracked, it has become discordant in its tones, even
                  when its utterer would strive most to please Such is the penalty that the
                  all-fascinating charms of Italians and Grecia's daughters must pay for their brief
                  spring and summer of loveliness. But with Zoe it was not thus. Her beauty had
                  partaken more of a masculine character, and she seemed to have inherited with it a
                  masculine endurance and any one who had seen her features as she sat in the stern
                  sheets of the boat which bore her, as she hoped, to witness the consummation of
                  her long cherished desire for vengeance—perfect—complete—would have likened her to
                  a beautiful fury—a fallen angel, whose beauty had not withered, though she had
                  become an outcast from paradise; but in whose face the demoniac passions which had
                  lured her on to the wreck of her hopes, to the loss of her eternal beatitude, had
                  imprinted their indelible marks, still without power to utterly obliterate the
                  stamp of the divinity which had originally been imprinted upon her features.</p>
               <p>Giorgio—as he was called by his band, although Zoe ever called him by the name of
                  Abdallah—had already, as it appeared, forgotten the words which had caused the
                  blood to tingle in his veins, and awakened in him something of the vindictive
                  spirit of his mother. The well spring which had been touched, and which had
                  aroused such an ebullition of fearful passion, had as suddenly subsided, as soon
                  as the hand that touched it had been withdrawn and though the expression of his
                  countenance was still fierce and fearless, the features had assumed their
                  characteristic careless recklessness. Silently the rowers pulled towards the
                  shore; the boat stranded on the sand, and the crew, all but one—to whom its
                  keeping was confided—sprang ashore; and again Giorgio and Zoe stepped aside and
                  communed with each other on the beach.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Seymour and Zuleika were sleeping; but the slumbers of the latter were strangely
                  disturbed, and every now and then she awoke with a start and listened earnestly,
                  as though in her dreams she had heard some fearful noise, or seen some frightful
                  object; but all was still, save the hollow, melancholy murmur of the surf, which,
                  as has already been mentioned, perpetually broke upon the rocky coast to windward
                  of the cottage, and Zuleika would pass her hand over the head of her husband to
                  satisfy herself that he was beside her? and then pressing her baby to her breast,
                  would smile at her own fears, and endeavor to compose herself to sleep again; but
                  only again and again to awaken in a similar condition of affright.</p>
               <p>It is a strange, an inexplicable mystery, that forewarning, which, let sophists
                  say what they may, is often manifest in our dreams previous to the occurrence of
                  any great calamity. We know not why our slumbers should be more disturbed than
                  usual without any apparent cause. We know not how it is that little trifling
                  occurrences, which in ordinary times would pass unnoticed, are all magnified into
                  matters of moment; but so it is; and it is one of the hidden mysteries of natural
                  philosophy which man is unable to fathom.</p>
               <p>Again Zuleika awoke, and this time she felt assured that it was not alone the
                  melancholy music of the surf which disturbed the solemn silence of the night. She
                  fancied she heard the voices of men, borne faintly and indistinctly to her ears
                  upon the scarcely perceptible zephyrs; and greatly terrified, although unwilling
                  to arouse Seymour without sufficient cause, she sat up in her bed to listen and to
                  assure herself that her fancy was not playing her false. No; nearer and nearer
                  seemed the voices to advance, and now her quick ear—for every sense was peculiarly
                  active at this moment—detected the measured tramp of footsteps—trodden lightly and
                  softly, yet distinctly audible. She sprang from her bed, and peeped out from the
                  casement. She had not been deceived, for stealthily approaching the cottage<pb
                     n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7191-00000209"/> tage from the shore was a band of men,
                  and two vessels were now visible in the harbor where only one had lain at anchor
                  when she had retired to rest. She could barely distinguish the outlines of the
                  forms of the men as they approached, for the moon had gone down, as we heretofore
                  mentioned, and the pale twinkling of the stars was partially obscured, for the
                  ominous cloud which had been observed rising from the waters in the distant
                  horizon, now had so increased in size as to cover half the heavens, and it hung
                  directly over the cottage. Greatly alarmed, she stepped back from the window, and
                  retreating to the bed, touched her husband on the shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Wake, George, wake," she said; "there are men advancing towards our cottage, and
                  arrange sail—one of the fleet I saw yesterday, I think—is anchor in the bay."</p>
               <p>Seymour sprang up from the bed, and hurried to the window. The men had approached
                  nearer, and he at once suspected them to be a party of marauders who had landed on
                  the island with the object of robbery. He hastily threw on his clothing and
                  descended to the apartment occupied by De Sylva, whom he informed of the presence
                  of the pirates, and of his suspicions of an attack upon the cottage. In a few
                  moments the Portuguese had put on his clothing, and Seymour having handed him a
                  pair of pistols and a cutlass, he re-ascended to Zuleika, and desired her to
                  retire into the chamber occupied by Marie and Jane.</p>
               <p>"Is there danger of an attack, George?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Thereis, darling; but when they find we are prepared for them they will very
                  probably retire," said Seymour.</p>
               <p>"Then," replied Zuleika, "my place is beside my husband and our babe. I will not
                  leave you."</p>
               <p>There was no time for further parley; the band had reached the little inclosure
                  surrounding the cottage, and it was evident from their movements that they had no
                  suspicion that their approach had been discovered. One, who appeared to be the
                  leader, stood aside with a tall female, and conversed for some moments, and then,
                  as he made a sign to his followers, the whole party stealthily advanced. Zuleika,
                  holding her babe, whom she had snatched from the cot, her arms, was looking out
                  from the window, while Seymour and De Sylva were examining the priming of their
                  firearms. Suddenly she exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"George, the woman approaching is Zoe. What can be the meaning of this? Surely
                  they are friends. They can intend ns no harm."</p>
               <p>But Seymour thought differently. For the first time an idea of the real object of
                  the marauders flashed upon him.</p>
               <p>"Zoe!" he exclaimed, and, peeping from the window, he added, "It is indeed! Then
                  there is nothing left for us but defence to the last."</p>
               <p>He whispered a few words to De Sylva, and the two men approached the casement,
                  having desired Zuleika (who had been joined by Marie and Jane, both of whom had
                  been alarmed by the noise in the cottage) to retire to an adjoining apartment.</p>
               <p>The band were now close to the cottage, and were evidently preparing to surround
                  it, with the intention of forcing an entrance, when Seymour discharged a pistol
                  over the head of their leader. They were taken so completely by surprise that many
                  of them showed symptoms of retreating, being probably under the impression that
                  several of the brig's crew were in the cottage, and that the attack had been
                  anticipated. They were, however, addressed by Zoe, who, with energetic action,
                  stigmatized them as cowards, and urged them at once to enter the cottage.</p>
               <p>At this moment Seymour opened the casement, and demanded, in the Romaic dialect,
                  what they wanted.</p>
               <p>The leader replied, in the same dialect—</p>
               <p>"We demand the rendition of Bedita, who is a daughter of our race, and is
                  unlawfully detained by the Frank, who has assumed the proprietorship of this
                  island, which belongs to us. Deliver up Bedita, and we will retire."</p>
               <p>"Never!" replied Seymour; and hardly had the words escaped his lips when a
                  pistol-shot entered the casement above his head and lodged in the wall behind
                  him.</p>
               <p>There was a suppressed shriek from Marie and Jane, and Seymour turned his head,
                  fearing that some one had been hit. He saw, however, that the females were merely
                  frightened. Zuleika, still holding her babe, although pale as marble, showed a
                  spirit that he little dreamed she possessed.</p>
               <p>"It is nothing, George," she said. "Jane was frightened at the sound of the
                  pistol, but she will not shriek again. I heard what was said, and I trust all to
                  you. Alive, neither you nor I will fall into the hands of these men, though God
                  knows why they should seek to injure me."</p>
               <p>Seymour kissed her cheek and pressed her hand, but without replying, he returned
                  to the side of De Sylva. There were ten or twelve men in the band, and fancying
                  that the pistol-shot<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7191-00000210"/> shot had taken
                  effect, as they had heard the shriek, they rushed in a body to the cottage porch,
                  evidently with the intention of forcing the door.</p>
               <p>"Take good aim and fire," said Seymour to De Sylva, and at the same moment the
                  report of two pistols were heard, and two of the pirates fell to the earth,
                  rolling over and tearing up the soil in handfulls in their agony.</p>
               <p>A volley from the band was the reply to this demonstration of determination on the
                  part of the beseiged, but Seymour and De Sylva had retired into the recess behind
                  the casement, and again the balls entered the room and lodged in the walls. This
                  time the terrified females were silent. Their first alarm had subsided, and with
                  the passive courage and presence of mind so often displayed by women in the hour
                  of danger, they quietly took the discharged pistols which Seymour and De Sylva had
                  laid, aside, and proceeded to reload them. It was hazardous now for either Seymour
                  or the Portuguese to show themselves at the casement; instant death would have
                  been the result of such rashness. They could only, therefore, keep up an irregular
                  and ill-directed fire, unconscious whether or not their shots took effect.</p>
               <p>Now all was silent without, and the beseiged party began to entertain the hope
                  that the assailants, finding that they had been resolutely met, had withdrawn, and
                  Seymour was in the act of approaching the window to reconnoitre, when De Sylva
                  laid his hand upon his arm—</p>
               <p>"Do you not smell smoke?" he asked; "and hark! there is the crackling of burning
                  timber; the wretches have fired the cottage."</p>
               <p>Hardly had he spoken, when a volume of smoke burst into the apartment, so dense
                  and stifling that they could hardly draw their breaths, and in another moment the
                  boards began to grow heated beneath their feet, and the flames burst through the
                  slight flooring. To stay a moment longer in the room would have insured the
                  destruction of the whole party. To flee seemed alike to threaten them with instant
                  death at the hands of the now infuriated pirates. In fact, there was no hope of
                  escape, and a very few moments would have witnessed the sacrifice of Seymour and
                  De Sylva, and the capture of the women, had not an unforeseen diversion in their
                  favor attracted the attention of the assailants, and rendered it necessary for
                  them to defend themselves on their part from an attack they had not anticipated.
                  The mate of the Portuguese brig had been much alarmed at the appearance of the
                  felucca in the bay, and the questions that had been asked by the commander of the
                  suspicious-looking vessel had not seemed to quiet his apprehensions. He had kept
                  the night-watch himself, had seen the departure of the boat from the side of the
                  felucca, and had watched their movements after they had landed upon the shore as
                  well as he was able to do with the aid of a night-teloscope. He had heard the
                  report of the first pistol, fired by Seymour, and the faithful fellow, believing
                  his captain, who was a favorite with all on board, to be in danger, had called
                  five of the seamen out of the seven comprising the crew, and, putting himself at
                  their head, had landed and reached the scene of the affray just at the moment when
                  the pirates, exasperated at the opposition they had met with, and at the loss of
                  two of their comrades, had fired the cottage.</p>
               <p>The island was but sparsely inhabited, but the simple fishermen and their families
                  had in the short space of time that had elapsed since Seymour had brought Zuleika
                  thither, became much attached to them, and the male inmates of two cottages that
                  were located near that occupied by Seymour and Zuleika had been alarmed by the
                  unwonted sound of firearms, and when the crew of the brig approached, they at the
                  request of the mate had joined them, thus augmenting the force to seven men, who
                  arrived opportunely, just at the moment when, after having succeeded in firing the
                  cottage, the pirates imagined they had secured an easy prey.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>"We can endure this no longer; death in open fight were preferable to be smothered
                  and consumed amid this smoke and flame," said Seymour, and snatching the infant
                  from Zuleika's arms, while with his left arm he encircled the slender waist of his
                  young wife, he called upon Jane Miller to follow him, and rushed through the
                  stifling smoke as though he was unencumbered by any weight, while De Sylva caught
                  up Marie in similar fashion, and followed close after him. The poor girls uttered
                  not one cry of alarm. As we have said, the moment they had realized a sense of
                  their danger, they had not only refrained from showing any outward signs of fear,
                  save the pallor of their cheeks; but they had done their best to aid in the
                  gallant though useless endeavor to hold the cottage against its assailants; now
                  they readily submitted themselves to the guidance of their protectors, and in the
                  course of a few foments they were breathing gratefully the pure air of the
                     night<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC7191-00000211"/> —a happy relief, for they had
                  been nearly suffocated in the cottage.</p>
               <p>A sad scene of desolation, however, met their gaze when they had gained the open
                  air. The light, fragile structure they had just quitted was already doomed; in
                  less than fire minutes it was a mere heap of smouldering ruins.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the pirates, on meeting the unexpected opposition from the crew of the
                  brig and the two Greek fishermen, had endeavored to retreat towards the beach,
                  still fighting as they fled; and they had been followed by the assailants.</p>
               <p>The report of pistols and the clash of steel was heard by the party that had just
                  effected a narrow escape from the burning cottage, and as soon as Seymour and De
                  Sylva had in some measure recovered from the effects of the smoke, they rushed
                  forward in the direction whence the sounds Of Strife proceeded, followed by the
                  women, whom no persuasions could induce to remain behind. They were ignorant of
                  the nature of the diversion that had been made in their favor; but Seymour and De
                  Sylva had become excited for the affray, and rushed to mingle in it with the ardor
                  of bloodhounds.</p>
               <p>When they reached the beach, they found a deadly fight raging with the utmost fury
                  on both sides. The parties, since the death of the two Greek sailors, who had
                  fallen on the first discharge from the pistols of Seymour and De Sylva, were very
                  nearly matched, although still the pirates had rather the superiority in point of
                  numbers. One of the Portuguese seamen and another one of the Greeks had fallen on
                  the beach, and now, there being no time to re-load the firearms, a terrific
                  hand-to-hand combat had commenced, in which Zoe was observed to take an active
                  part. She had seized a cutlass from the rigid hand of the dead Greek sailor, and
                  was dealing furious blows with it on all sides. The men, who rushed wildly and
                  recklessly upon the Greeks, shrunk back from the fury of the Amazon.</p>
               <p>When Seymour and De Sylva reached the spot, the former readily recognized the two
                  Greek fishermen who had arrayed themselves on his side, and the latter as readily
                  recognized his own gallant tars. Raising a shout of defiance, he plunged in
                  amongst them, followed by Seymour; and the Greeks, seeing the reinforcement,
                  showed signs of wavering. They would have fled to their boat, but they were
                  rallied by Giorgio; and again the desperate conflict commenced with renewed energy
                  and fury on both sides. In the heat of the strife, Seymour had not noticed that
                  Zoe had withdrawn herself from the affray, and right and left were he and his
                  gallant band dealing their blows, with every prospect of eventual success, for two
                  more of the pirates had fallen, when his attention was arrested by a fearful
                  shriek from Zuleika. Wildly, he turned his head in the direction whence the sound
                  proceeded, and saw her in the dim light, struggling in the powerful clutches of
                  Zoe, who had nearly reached the boat with her, and who was calling upon the
                  pirates to cease the strife, and follow her, and thus make their escape with their
                  prize on board the felucca.</p>
               <p>Maddened with what he saw, Seymour was thrown off his guard, and his left arm was
                  rendered powerless by a heavy blow from the scimetar of a Greek sailor with whom
                  he was desperately fighting when the fearful scream had called his attention from
                  his opponent. The Greek saw his advantage, and a second blow would have ended
                  Seymour's life, had not De Sylva observed his danger, and rushing towards him
                  struck the pirate a sweeping blow with the heavy cutlass he carried, which clove
                  him from the crown of his head d to the shoulder blade. The seaman fell to the
                  ground, then rolled over and over in agony, and then, springing half up fell
                  heavily upon the earth, dead, while the blood spouted in a black stream from his
                  throat, and dyed and saturated the sand around him.</p>
               <p>Seymour was severely wounded; a crimson stream was pouring from his arm; but,
                  heedless of the pain, he rushed madly to the boat just in time to reach it before
                  Zoe had succeeded in launching it from the sand into deep water—there, weakened
                  with the loss of blood, he fell senseless into the ebbing waters, and would have
                  drowned, had he not been dragged forth by one of the Greek fishermen, who happily
                  arrived in time to rescue him.</p>
               <p>Giorgio had rushed to the assistance of Zoe, and the remnant of his band, seeing
                  now that the odds were against them, were also making all haste to reach the boat,
                  which they would have succeeded in shoving off, had not De Sylva taken the
                  opportunity to reload his pistol. He fired it at Giorgio, who fell mortally
                  wounded into the water.</p>
               <p>Zuleika had fainted in the arms of Zoe, but the infant was screaming fearfully;
                  and, aroused to consciousness by the voice of his child, Seymour sat up and
                  loading his pistol hastily, fired it at a tall female who had at that moment, for
                  the first time made her appearance at the scene of strife, and snatched the infant
                  from the arms of Zoe.</p>
               <pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7191-00000212"/>
               <p>A yell of agony burst from the aged Marca, for it was she who, with what purpose
                  must forever remain unknown, had snatched the infant from her daughter's arms—and
                  a piercing shriek of pain from the infant, told that the shot had a double effect;
                  Marca fell, still holding the babe in her arms, and when De Sylva rushed forward
                  to take the infant from her, both were dead; the ball had passed through the body
                  of the babe, and had lodged in Marca's heart. Seymour in a moment of phrenzy had
                  shot his own child.</p>
               <p>When Zoe saw her son fall, she dashed aside the fainting form of Zuleika, who fell
                  senseless on the sand, and rushing into the water, she fell upon him, caught him
                  in her embrace, and with wild energy sought to staunch the blood which gushed in a
                  dark stream from his side, with her long black hair, the meanwhile lavishing upon
                  him every expression of endearment with which the Greek vocabulary is so rich, and
                  mingling with those expressions of endearment terrific objurgations upon his
                  murderers; then, suddenly springing up, she rushed towards the prostrate form of
                  Zuleika, and drawing a dagger from her girdle, raised her arm in the air, and
                  struck with deadly force at the breast of the unconscious girl.</p>
               <p>At the moment she raised her arm a pistol shot from De Sylva broke the bone, but
                  it was too late; the arm fell feebly, but the convulsive shudder which shook the
                  frame of Zuleika told too truly that Zoe had partially, at least, succeeded in her
                  murderous design.</p>
               <p>The remnant of the crew of the felucca, reduced to three in number, finding that
                  they had been completely defeated, and that their leaders had fallen, put off to
                  their vessel, which was immediately got under weigh, and before daylight they were
                  far from the island, bound to rejoin their comrades, and to report to them the sad
                  failure of their ill-starred expedition.</p>
               <p>A sad, sad scene greeted the approach of morn on Zuleika's Isle. In the cabin of
                  one—the surviving one of the fishermen who had so generously aided in the defence
                  of the cottage—the remnant of those who, full of life and hope, but yesterday had
                  met in the deadly conflict of the night, were assembled. Of the five men belonging
                  to the Portuguese brig, but three were living. De Sylva had escaped unscathed,
                  although he had been most daring in the affray. Seymour was sitting in a chair
                  beside the rude couch which supported the dying Zuleika, scarcely able to support
                  himself upright in consequence of the weakness occasioned by the loss of blood,
                  with a face pallid as marble, and so overpowered with grief that he scarcely knew
                  what he was doing or where he was; while ever and anon he burst forth in bitter
                  lamentations that he had not fallen in the fight rather than have been spared to
                  suffer the misery he now endured. On a table near the couch was stretched the
                  corpse of the infant, still smiling sweetly, even in death; and beside the pale
                  corpse were seated Marie and Jane, dissolved in tears. They had been impotent yet
                  anguished witnesses of the direful affray of the previous night.</p>
               <p>Zuleika was still breathing, but from the moment she had received the fatal blow
                  she had not spoken, and the gurgling in her throat told that her dissolution was
                  at hand.</p>
               <p>Unable to endure the harrowing scene, De Sylva quitted the cabin to breathe the
                  fresh sea breeze of the morning. He wandered to the beach, which, during the
                  night, had been the scene of strife. There still lay the dead bodies of his own
                  gallant crew, and that of the fisherman who had perished in the defence of his
                  patron. And there, too, lay the stiffened corpses of the Greek pirates, and that
                  of the ancient sibyl, Marca, hideously revolting in death; but there were yet two
                  others lying beneath the water, a short distance from the shore, barely covered by
                  the tide. These were the bodies of Zoe and Abdallah. De Sylva drew them, with some
                  difficulty, on shore, for the form of the pirate chief was tightly clasped in the
                  embrace of the female. His death, it was evident, had been caused by the ball,
                  which had penetrated his side and pierced his vitals; but Zoe showed no wound but
                  the broken arm. She had crawled from the spot where she had fallen to seek and
                  embrace her son, and had died, not from the effect of the wound she had received,
                  but from the intensity of her own emotions—the thought of the ruin and death she
                  had brought upon the only one being she loved—the consciousness that she had
                  failed in her diabolical attempts, and that her hopes of satiating her vengeance
                  according to her own desires were for ever frustrated.</p>
               <p>De Sylva returned to the cabin, and beckoning the poor remnant of his crew, he
                  ordered them to remove the dead bodies and place them in the boat, and then
                  stepping on board himself, he ordered the seamen to pull out into the bay. There,
                  at a distance of a mile from the shore, in the deep blue waters of the Ægean Sea,
                  the dead were cast overboard, foe and friend "in one burial blent," and the
                  prayers of the Catholic<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC7191-00000213"/> lic church
                  repeated over their remains as they sunk down deep—deep beneath the still ocean
                  surface.</p>
               <p>This needful rite ended, De Sylva returned to the shore, and with a heavy heart
                  and slow footsteps retraced his path to the fisherman's cabin.</p>
               <p>A change had taken place in his absence. An aged woman, to whom Zuleika had been
                  known, and to whom she had been kind since her residence on the isle, had come to
                  the cottage, and witnessing with an aching heart the wild grief of Seymour, and
                  hearkening to his impassioned request for one word—one single word from Zuleika's
                  lips—ere death, fast approaching, had sealed them for ever, she had retired to the
                  fields, and gathering some herbs, had made a decoction, with which she had wetted
                  the lips of the poor, innocent, unconscious sufferer, at the same time endeavoring
                  to pour a few drops down her throat. The effect had been electrical The dying girl
                  gasped for breath, her frame shook violently, and her agonized friends, who had
                  clustered around the couch, turned away with sickening hearts; but soon her
                  muscles relaxed, and, opening her eyes, she gazed wildly around her; then
                  recognizing Seymour, who, no longer able to control his emotion, was weeping over
                  her, she smiled, and said—</p>
               <p>"You here, dear George? Where am I? What has happened? Where is our babe,
                  George?"</p>
               <p>Seymour was unable to reply, but he stooped his head and passionately kissed her
                  lips and brow.</p>
               <p>"Ha!" she continued, "I recollect it all now. Thank God that you, dear George,
                  have not fallen a victim to the fury of those evil men. Why did they attack us,
                  George? Oh! I feel faint. George, I am dying. Where is our babe?"</p>
               <p>"She is in Jane Miller's charge, my Zuleika," said Seymour, as well as his grief
                  would allow him to speak. "You are too weak to see her."</p>
               <p>"Nay, George, she, is dead. I have lair a long time insensible to the things of
                  earth, and I have seen our dear child, a happy angel in heaven; and she smiled on
                  me, and made her little innocent gestures for me to follow her. I shall do so
                  soon. I know your motive, George, in trying to deceive me: but there is no need of
                  it—I know all. Place her beside me. Let me die with her in my arms, pillowed upon
                  my breast; and, George, we will watch over you, and do you, too, soon join us in
                  the glorious resting-place where our little Zuleika's spirit now is, and where
                  mine will soon rejoin hers. Why those tears, George?" she continued, witnessing
                  the evidence of his emotion. "I am happy. I could have wished to have lived a
                  little while longer on earth, <emph>to be with you always,</emph> George, as we
                  have so often fondly pictured; but it has been otherwise decreed, and oar home, so
                  often spoken of, so long patiently waited for, will now be in heaven."</p>
               <p>There was a stir at the door of the cabin, and an aged man, nearly blind, was led
                  in by two of the youths of the island.</p>
               <p>"It is Father Otho," exclaimed the owner of the cabin. "Lady, old Otho has come to
                  see you."</p>
               <p>Zuleika faintly smiled and endeavored to extend her hand to the old man, but she
                  was unequal to the effort. Otho had been led to the bedside, and he saw the
                  ineffectual movement, and took the fair, delicate hand in his own withered
                  palm.</p>
               <p>"Lady," he said, in his pure, musical Greek, "this is a sorrowful sight. It is sad
                  to witness the young and beautiful stricken to death and borne away to the cold
                  grave, before the aged and palsied, who have long been waiting, expectant of the
                  visit of the dread messenger. Yet, lady, yours is a happier lot than mine,
                  sorrowful as are the circumstances under which your spirit is about to wing its
                  flight to the realms of light. You have been spared the sorrows and distresses of
                  a long and weary life, and ere you have lost the freshness and innocence of youth,
                  are about to leave this dull earth and partake of the joys of eternal
                  happiness."</p>
               <p>"I know—I feel it is so—good Otho," replied Zuleika, who was momentarily growing
                  weaker, for her sand of life almost run out, had been but temporarily stayed by
                  the elixir that the old Greek woman had prepared. "My child is gone before me to
                  the eternal world of which we have so often discoursed in your humble cabin. I
                  long to rejoin her, but still I would linger willingly had heaven not decreed it
                  otherwise, for the sake of my husband. It is a bitter thought that I must leave
                  him behind but may God grant that in His good time he may be united to me there.
                  There shall be our everlasting home, "dear George—there the happy abode where we
                  shall be gether always," she continued addressing Seymour. "You, our little
                  Zuleika-poor innocent babe—and I. We have Only mistaken the locality of that
                  blissful abode we have so often dreamed of. We thought it would be on earth, dear
                  George. One wiser than we has decreed that it shall be in heaven; George, you will
                  meet me in heaven; and you Jane," addressing<pb n="412-413"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000214"/> Jane Miller, who, with Marie, was sitting at the
                  bedside drowned in tears; "and you, too, good, dear old-Otho, to whom I owe so
                  much; and all—all who are here?"</p>
               <p>"Let us pray," solemnly exclaimed old Otho, rising from his seat with a strength
                  and agility that seemed impossible for one so decrepit with age and infirmity to
                  possess. "Let us pray to God that all who are now here assembled may meet in
                  heaven;" and falling upon his knees by the bedside, he began to pray aloud.</p>
               <p>With a simultaneous movement all present knelt down, and the aged Christian poured
                  forth an extempore prayer, with a fervor and eloquence that touched the hearts of
                  all the assembly.</p>
               <p>He was raised to his seat when he had concluded, for his strength, seemingly so
                  supernaturally given him, had failed, and Seymour, rising at the same moment,
                  again took his seat beside his dying wife. A film was gathering over her eyes, her
                  sight was failing, for she feebly endeavored to stretch forth her hand to Seymour,
                  groping as one in the dark. The grief-stricken, almost heart-broken husband, took
                  the soft, fair hand in his own, and bent down over her.</p>
               <p>"Closer, closer, George," she gasped, "place your ear close to my lips."</p>
               <p>Tremblingly and silently Seymour obeyed.</p>
               <p>"Remember," said the dying girl, "remember, George! you promised me that—you—would
                  strive—to become a Christian—promise me again."</p>
               <p>Seymour was unable to speak—but he pressed her hand. The pressure was feebly
                  returned. The sign was understood, and a smile illumined Zuleika's pale face,
                  while her lips moved, as if she were uttering a prayer, or whispering her
                  gratitude to heaven.</p>
               <p>The arm that encircled the dead babe moved convulsively, as though the dying
                  mother were unwilling to part with the mortal remains of her infant until her
                  spirit rejoined that of her child in heaven.</p>
               <p>"George," she faintly murmured in disconnected sentences, "I must leave you, dear
                  husband—I am called away. I hear strains of sweet music, and angelic forms arrayed
                  in bright garments are beckoning to me from the sky. But why is it dark, George?
                  Why have they closed the shutters? They need not be afraid to see me die."</p>
               <p>"It is not dark, Zuleika, my only love—the shutters have not been closed," replied
                  Seymour, but she whom he had addressed did not hear him. Her hand was still locked
                  in that of her husband, a convulsive shudder agitated her frame, a gurgling,
                  choking sound issued from her throat, for a moment she struggled as though she
                  were suffering mortal agony—and then all was still! With a smile upon her lips, as
                  radiant, as loving, as innocent as that sweet face had ever worn in the heyday of
                  life and health, the gentle Zuleika died. Seymour threw himself franticly upon the
                  pale, cold corpse of her he had loved so well, and gave full vent to his grief.
                  His bosom heaved, and his frame shook with the intensity of his emotions. The
                  strong man wept in his agony!</p>

               <p>THROUGHOUT that sorrowful day Seymour sat by the side of the corpse of his adored
                  Zuleika, alone, for he refused to be comforted. The wound in his arm, though
                  severe, was not dangerous, and it had been carefully dressed by some of the Greek
                  women of the island, who generally practiced what little surgery and medical duty
                  was required, and usually with success; but he heeded not the pain of the wound;
                  even had it been ten times more painful, he would not have felt it. Jane Miller
                  and Marie Wilson, and Captain De Sylva, each and all strove to administer comfort
                  to him; but in vain. He at first listened with apparent patience; but with his
                  thoughts in reality dwelling upon other topics, until at length he sternly, almost
                  savagely, desired them to leave the apartment. They complied, and he locked door
                  and closed the shutters, and then turning himself upon the bed beside the dead
                  bodies of his wife and child, he thus remained until night and through the night
                  until the morning again broke, and his friends having grown alarmed at the silence
                  that prevailed in that dark, closed, desolate apartment, forced open the door.</p>
               <p>What thoughts had passed through the mind of the mourner during that long period
                  of intense grief, no one knew, no one<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC7191-00000215"/>
                  can ever know. De Sylva entered and found him kneeling by the side of the bed, the
                  fair hand of his wife, now rigid and cold in death, clasped in his own so tightly
                  that it was with difficulty De Sylva could unloose it. Seymour at first seemed
                  unconscious of his presence, and it was only after repeated endeavors to recall
                  him to himself, that the grief-stricken husband allowed himself to be led from the
                  room. His friends were terror-stricken at the change which those twenty-four hours
                  of woe had made in his appearance. His sable hair was strewn with threads of grey;
                  his face was haggard; his athletic form seemed to have lost all its vigor and
                  elasticity, and his clear, olive, richly sunburnt complexion had become sallow.
                  Twenty years seemed during the course of that one day and night to have been added
                  to his life. On the day before he was the beau ideal of a handsome man, in the
                  full prime and vigor of manhood; now he presented the appearance of a man far
                  advanced into middle life, with a shattered constitution and a debilitated
                  frame.</p>
               <p>Sunken into despondency, he barely replied to the few necessary questions that
                  were addressed to him, and shrunk alike from observation and sympathy. But he did
                  not attempt to enter the chamber of death again—and when De Sylva, and Jane
                  Miller—who had been under the necessity of explaining to the young Portuguese the
                  apparent mystery of her presence, with as much delicacy as possible—hinted the
                  necessity of making preparations for the funeral, he made no objections. He left
                  all to them, and seemed only desirous to be left alone to the indulgence of his
                  silent and painful reveries.</p>
               <p>The negro nurse, assisted by Jane Miller, proceeded to arrange the corpses of the
                  young mother and her child for interment. Poor Julia had been forgotten amidst the
                  terrific events of the late deadly struggle, but she had heard the approach of the
                  pirates, before Zuleika's ear had caught the sound of their footsteps. She had
                  risen from her bed and gone out to reconnoitre, and being afraid to enter the
                  cottage again after it was surrounded by the armed band; she had concealed herself
                  amongst the shrubbery and there had been a witness of the strife.</p>
               <p>But the negress had been fondly attached to her mistress and the infant, and with
                  the peculiar characteristic of her race, she had, since Zuleika and her child's
                  deaths, given way to boistrous, uncontrollable grief.</p>
               <p>With sobs and lamentations, loud and long, she assisted Jane in the mournful task.
                  The carpenter of the Petrel was instructed to make the coffin, and by nightfall of
                  that day, everything was arranged for the funeral. Seymour was informed of this,
                  and then, for the first time since he had been led from the room in the morning,
                  he expressed his desire once again to look upon the remains of his wife and child,
                  before they were committed to the grave.</p>
               <p>He was led into the room by De Sylva, who requested Jane Miller to be at hand, as
                  he expected another frantic display of grief.</p>
               <p>But he was agreeably disappointed.</p>
               <p>Seymour approached the coffin, stooped down and kissed the cold cheek of the
                  infant as it lay upon its mother's bosom, and then imprinting another long,
                  lingering kiss upon the pale lips of Zuleika, he took her hand in his, and
                  whispered, as though she could hear him:</p>
               <p>"<emph>I will remember!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Then turning to De Sylva, he said, calmly.</p>
               <p>"Lead me from the room—I feel weak and faint."</p>
               <p>De Sylva led him from the apartment.</p>
               <p>"All is ready for the funeral," said he, "are you willing that it should take
                  place to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to-night," replied Seymour.</p>
               <p>"Several of the matrons and maidens of the island desire once more to look upon
                  the remains of her they have learned to love so well; and old Otho is here, he
                  would like to see 'his lady,' as he calls her, again—are you willing they should
                  be admitted?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Seymour, in the same cold, apathetic tone of voice.</p>
               <p>The Greek women and old Otho were admitted. The girls had brought handfulls of
                  sweet wild flowers with which they strewed the bier, and almost covered the bodies
                  it contained, and then one by one they kissed Zuleika's brow, which they bathed in
                  tears, unable to control the warm impulses of their ardent natures. Old Otho was
                  the last who approached the corpse; he took Zuleika's hand in his own, and then,
                  raising his trembling right hand to heaven, he muttered almost inaudibly, some
                  Greek words, then letting his arm fall, laid his hand upon his heart,
                  exclaiming—</p>
               <p>"All is peace!"</p>
               <p>He was led by De Sylva from the room, and the bearers arrived to carry the coffin
                  to the grave. The carpenter screwed<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC7191-00000216"/>
                  down the lid, and assisted by De Sylva, bore it to the outside of the cottage. The
                  bearers who had volunteered, were six young Greek girls, who placed their
                  kerchiefs beneath the bier, and holding either end, walked three on each side.
                  There was no pall, nor any inscription upon the coffin; a bunch of white flowers
                  alone bedecked the bier; a red poppy was intertwined with the bouquet, to signify
                  that the deceased had died a violent death; but Jane Miller desired its removal.
                  She wished to associate no ideas of violence with the last of one so innocent and
                  beautiful as Zuleika, and her desire was readily complied with. Indeed, it was she
                  who took upon herself with a calmness and assiduity that attracted the admiration
                  of all, the entire arrangement of the melancholy cortege. There was no priest on
                  the island, and old Otho—now nearly blind, and so decrepit that he was obliged to
                  be supported by two stout Greek youths, offered to recite the prayers of the Greek
                  church (from memory) over the grave; Seymour followed immediately behind the bier,
                  supported by De Sylva, then followed Jane and Marie, then the negress Julia, and
                  behind them a procession of Greek men, women, and youths of both sexes, comprising
                  almost all the inhabitants of the island.</p>
               <p>The Greek girls chanted a mournful dirge as the cortege wended slowly along the
                  margin of the beach, to the spot where the wild surf broke unceasingly against the
                  rock-bound coast, making that melancholy music which Zuleika had so much delighted
                  to listen to.</p>
               <p>There, far above high-water mark, in a cypress grove, beneath the overhanging
                  cliffs, whence, in this spot, probably in congruence of some convulsion of nature
                  which had occurred centuries ago, the waters had receded, leaving a long, deep
                  beach, fringed close beneath the cliffs with sombre evergreens, the grave had been
                  prepared at Jane Miller's desire, in consequence of Zuleika haying one day
                  observed that if she were to die upon the island, it was near this spot she would
                  wish to be buried.</p>
               <p>The coffin was lowered into the lonely grave, and the sandy soil was thrown upon
                  it, until it was filled up—while the voice of old Otho, reciting the funeral
                  prayers of his church, was heard above the deep voice of the sea and the hollow
                  sound of the falling clods of earth.</p>
               <p>The mournful ceremony was over, and slowly, in little saddened groups, the
                  islanders departed to their homes. But Seymour now threw himself upon the grave,
                  and again gave vent to the violence of his grief, so long suppressed. He called
                  wildly upon Zuleika to awaken from her sleep—to come forth from the grave to speak
                  to him; to visit him again in form or in spirit—not to forsake him for ever. Jane
                  Miller and Marie became alarmed at the violence of his emotion, and De Sylva sat
                  down beside him, and strove, for a long time in vain, to comfort him. At length he
                  succeeded. The strange apathy which had followed the first violent outburst of
                  grief, again took possession of him, and he allowed De Sylva and Jane to lead him
                  towards the cottage of the poor fisherman; and the grave of Zuleika was left of
                  the wild, savage solitude of nature. The hollow winds whistled over it;—above it
                  the sea-bird whirled its flight and screamed its discordant notes; and the moaning
                  surf, beating upon the rocks near by, sung a perpetual requiem.</p>
               <p>Another and another day dawned upon Zuleika's Isle, no longer graced by the gentle
                  being whose name it bore, but bearing within its bosom her mortal remains, there
                  to rest in peace till the day of resurrection. Seymour had fallen into a state of
                  stupor, which alarmed his friends. At Jane Miller's urgent request, seconded by
                  Marie, and by the prompting of his own generous nature, De Sylva delayed the
                  departure of the Petrel for several days after his new spars had been made and his
                  vessel repaired, although he was anxious to proceed on his voyage. Jane was
                  fearful, and not without reason, that when the remnant of the pirate crew reached
                  the body of the fleet, after their ill-starred expedition, they would seek
                  revenge, and again visit the island in overpowering numbers, and she was anxious
                  to quit it as soon as possible—anxious again to revisit her home, and her mother
                  and brother—growing more and more anxious every day. But daily did Seymour visit
                  the grave of his beloved wife, and spend hour after hour vainly calling upon her
                  to come back to him—entreating her not to leave him to anguish and despair. His
                  friends grew alarmed for his reason and De Sylva at last thought of carrying him
                  away by force.</p>
               <p>One evening, he, for the first time since Zuleika's death, contrived to interest
                  him in conversation. It was his last hope. He had resolved, on the morrow, to
                  leave the island, and to take with him to Odessa, Seymour, Jane and the negress,
                  trusting to circumstances with regard to their future movements; but upon this
                  evening Seymour appeared willing to converse<pb n="418-419"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000217"/> verse, and De Sylva adroitly turned the subject of
                  conversation to the future prospects of Jane Miller.</p>
               <p>"Jane is anxious to reach her home again, poor girl!" said he; "and you, Captain
                  Seymour, it were well if you sought some other scene, where you might in time
                  learn to resign yourself to your loss."</p>
               <p>"It is irreparable," replied Seymour.</p>
               <p>"So it is. Still, it is vain to repine for that which cannot be helped. I am going
                  to sail for Odessa to-morrow morning; let us all go together. When you arrive
                  there we can consult as to what course is best to pursue. You can go back with me
                  to my own country, or can probably procure a passage for yourself and Jane to
                  America."</p>
               <p>"I shall not return to America," interrupted Seymour.</p>
               <p>"Then you can go to England or France, or where you will. But recollect your
                  promise to Jane Miller, that you would see that she returned home to her
                  mother."</p>
               <p>"I will go with you," said Seymour, suddenly arousing himself, as it were, from
                  his torpidity—as though some new idea had struck him. "I will go with you;
                  to-morrow, do you say you sail? Well, be it so; the sooner the better. Let it be
                  to-morrow. But is Jane Miller prepared?"</p>
               <p>"She is ready at any moment. I have requested Marie to speak with her. She has
                  entered into all our arrangements.</p>
               <p>Once possessed with the new idea that seemed suddenly to have occupied his mind,
                  Seymour displayed much of his wonted alacrity. He made all ready for his
                  departure; saw old Otho, and arranged for his future support, and engaged a Greek
                  woman to attend upon him—and then took an affectionate farewell of the old man,
                  whose sand of life was fast running out.</p>
               <p>"Otho—good old man," said he—"you will in all probability meet the spirit of my
                  sainted Zuleika in heaven ere long, while I must still wander a desolate outcast
                  upon earth. But tell her, if beatified spirits are permitted to hold converse
                  together, and to speak of things of earth; tell her that I will remember her
                  parting request—my last silent promise. Fare-well—pray for me, that some day I may
                  meet you in that happier abode."</p>
               <p>De Sylva, Jane, Marie and Seymour, since the destruction of the cottage, had made
                  the humble cabin of the fisherman their residence; him, Seymour handsomely
                  remunerated; he also provided for the widow and children of the fisherman whose
                  life had been lost in the defence of the cottage, and made presents of trifling
                  worth—yet still valuable to the poor, simple Greeks, to all the inhabitants of the
                  island—presents that would be of benefit to them, and at the same time serve as
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">souvenirs</foreign> of her whose memory he hoped would
                  ever be cherished by them.</p>
               <p>The day was far advanced before all these arrangements were completed. In the
                  evening Seymour seemed livelier than he had been since Zuleika's death. The
                  prospect of change appeared to have planted fresh hope in his heart, and after an
                  evening of pleasant, though subdued conversation, he and his friends retired to
                  rest. It was the last time they would sleep in a place embittered to them by such
                  painful recollections.</p>
               <p>On the morrow De Sylva rose early, and going on board his brig, ordered the mate
                  to get everything in readiness for sailing.</p>
               <p>He then returned on shore for the purpose of taking his passengers on board. Jane
                  Miller and Marie and the negress were ready; but Seymour had not made his
                  appearance. Jane had knocked at the door of his room, but no answer had been
                  returned and the women were beginning to feel alarmed.</p>
               <p>When De Sylva was informed of this, he entered the sleeping chamber. It was
                  empty—and more than that, Seymour's bed had not been slept in on the previous
                  night.</p>
               <p>At first a suspicion that the unhappy man had committed suicide flashed upon the
                  mind of De Sylva—and then the idea struck him that he might, perhaps, be found at
                  the grave of his wife. He hastened thither, taking Jane Miller, to whom he had
                  imparted his suspicions, with him.</p>
               <p>When they reached the spot, their minds were much relieved on witnessing the
                  object of their search seated on the little mound, which, planted with grass seed,
                  had been raised over the grave of the mother and child. A white rose bush which
                  Jane recognized as having once been a favorite plant of Zuleika's, and from which
                  she had been wont to pluck the flowers to adorn her hair, had been newly planted
                  on the grave, and Seymour was sitting with his head resting upon his hand, so
                  earnestly contemplating the rose bush, that he did not observe the approach of his
                  visitors until they were close upon him.</p>
               <p>"All is ready for sea, on board the Petrel, Captain Seymour," said De Sylva. "We
                  have been looking for you, and Jane, here, got frightened on finding that you had
                  not slept in your bed last night.</p>
               <pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC7191-00000218"/>
               <p>"Here, on this grave, has my last night in Zuleika's Isle been passed," replied
                  Seymour. "I went to the garden and dug up this rose bush, after we parted last
                  night, and brought it Mere and planted it. It was a favorite plant of Zuleika's,
                  and it is emblematical of her own innocence. I had thought to have spent the last
                  night in vigils over her tomb; but I have been sleeping for hours—and
                     <emph>she</emph> and our babe have appeared to me in my dreams. They smiled
                  sweetly, and Zuleika said she was happy—and bade me remember my promise to her. I
                  awoke and registered a vow, before heaven, that I would not forget it; nor will I.
                  I had forgotten that the hour of embarkation drew near, or I would not have kept
                  you waiting. I will pluck one white rose from the tree and wear it next my heart,
                  for Zuleika's sake; and then I will bid farewell for ever to the spot, and the
                  precious dust it contains, and be with you."</p>
               <p>He plucked the flower as he spoke, and casting a lingering look upon the grave,
                  rose from the sod and accompanied De Sylva and Jane to the cabin of the fisherman.
                  They found Marie and the negress awaiting them, and together they proceeded to the
                  boat that was to carry them on board the Petrel.</p>
               <p>In half an hour's space the Petrel was under weigh, and with a fine fresh breeze
                  was running along the shore of the island, which was lined with the honest, simple
                  inhabitants, who cheered the wanderers on their way, and bestowed blessings
                  innumerable upon Seymour, in return for the few kind offices he had done them
                  since he had chosen (unluckily) this island for his young wife's abode.</p>
               <p>Jane and Seymour Stood upon the raised poop of the brig, until the last faint
                  shadow of the land was no longer visible, and then the former retired to the cabin
                  occupied by Marie but Seymour sat on the taffrail, with his eyes turned in the
                  direction of the land long after it had sunk below the horizon. The seamen passed
                  to and fro busily engaged in their duties, but he heeded them not; he heard not
                  the orders given by the captain and the mate, as alternately they relieved each
                  other in the occupation of the quarter deck. The day passed away, and already the
                  first watch of the evening had commenced, and his reveries had not been disturbed
                  for De Sylva knew well that it was better that his passenger should be left
                  uninterruptedly in communication with his own thoughts; but when the hour of
                  supper arrived, he touched him gently on the shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Come, Captain Seymour," said he, "supper awaits us in the cabin; come down and
                  join Jane and Marie and me there. We have left you undisturbed to your reveries
                  all day; but you must be hungry and weary now, so come below."</p>
               <p>"The island has disappeared beneath the horizon?" said Seymour, in an absent
                  manner, and yet half interrogatively.</p>
               <p>"Hours ago," replied De Sylva.</p>
               <p>"And yet, until you touched me just now, I fancied I saw it still. I seemed to
                  wake to your touch, and the shadow disappeared."</p>
               <p>"You saw it merely in your imagination," answered De Sylva. "Come, come away
                  below. Marie and Jane are growing impatient. The former has called us half a dozen
                  times; come, recollect you have had no dinner."</p>
               <p>Seymour suffered himself to be led below to the cabin, where, after he had
                  partaken of the food that had been prepared, he laid down upon the sofa locker,
                  and fell asleep, for his mind and body were alike worn and wearied.</p>
               <p>The Petrel met with no adventure of moment during the remainder of her passage
                  through the Dardanelles and the still narrower channel of the Bosphorus, and
                  within a week after passing the latter, she entered the port of Odessa. A caravan
                  was on the point of starting overland to Moscow, at the time of their arrival, and
                  Seymour hearing this, resolved to go with it. He had no passport, but he had
                  money, and that will buy or break passports, or do anything else in Russia;
                  powerful, as it everywhere is, there it is all-powerful. So soon as it was
                  ascertained that he had wealth, his purposes were no longer questioned; he feed
                  the governor, and the deputy governor, and half a dozen subordinates military and
                  civic, and a passport was forged for him, and he was desired to hold himself in
                  readiness to start with the caravan on the following morning. He stated the object
                  he had in view in undertaking this journey to no one, further than telling Jane
                  Miller and De Sylva that he hoped the change of scene and the new mode of travel
                  would serve to divert his mind from brooding over his sad loss; and placing
                  sufficient funds in the hands of Jane to enable her to meet abundantly all the
                  expenses she might find it necessary to incur in order to reach home; and thanking
                  De Sylva for his kindness, in few words, but with a warm pressure of the hand, and
                  bidding farewell to Marie, he left them, and they <emph>saw</emph> him no more,
                  though Be was subsequently heard of by them.</p>
               <pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC7191-00000219"/>
               <p>It was arranged that Jane should stay with Marie, who, like herself, was a
                  fugitive from home, and return with De Sylva to Oporto, from which port he
                  promised to procure her a passage to New York; and here for the present shall we
                  leave them, and return to the history of those other personages who have figured
                  in our narrative, whose existence the reader will begin to think we have
                  forgotten.</p>

                  <p>Which treats of various Characters—and Commences to wind up the Story.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SOME months after the occurrence of the events described in the preceding chapter,
                  the widow Miller was seated with her son at breakfast in the parlor of the little
                  cottage in New Jersey. Tom was reading the newspaper aloud to his mother,
                  occasionally stopping to sip his coffee, for he had already finished the
                  substantial-portion of his breakfast when the knock of the postman was heard at
                  the door, and shortly afterwards the servant maid entered the parlor with a letter
                  addressed to Mr. Thomas Miller. Tom received the letter from the hands of the
                  servant, and breaking open the seal commenced to peruse it. Something peculiar in
                  the handwriting or something remarkable in the contents seemed to startle him, for
                  he sprang up from his chair, and the blood rushed from his cheeks, leaving his
                  face pale and colorless; while, although not subject to nervousness, his hands
                  trembled so much that he could scarcely read the letter.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter my dear?" asked the widow. "Have you any bad news in that
                  letter?"</p>
               <p>"No—mother—oh, no"—stammered the youth.</p>
               <p>"Then you must be unwell, for you tremble as if you had an ague fit, and your face
                  is as pale as that of a corpse."</p>
               <p>"Yes—I mean—no, mother, I am quite well—but—there is no bad news in the letter. On
                  the contrary, good news. Still, it has taken me unawares. I will retire to my own
                  room and finish its perusal, and then I will explain."</p>
               <p>"You are ordered away to sea again," said the widow, in a tone of alarm. "Surely,
                  they might give you longer leave of absence, after having been so long away from
                  me."</p>
               <p>"No, mother. This letter has no reference to the Service," said the youth; "but—I
                  cannot explain now. You shall know all; you shall read it yourself, by and
                  by."</p>
               <p>Thus speaking, he left the parlor and proceeded to his bedroom, where he finished
                  the perusal of the letter which had so much surprised and startled him.</p>
               <p>It was from his sister Jane. She had reached Oporto in safety in the Petrel, and
                  thence had taken her passage to New York, at which place she had arrived but a few
                  hours previous to writing the letter, which was dated from the —— Hotel in
                  Broadway. The letter was brief; but it said enough to account for much of the
                  mystery which Tom had hitherto been unable to penetrate. It stated that she had
                  made inquiry immediately upon her arrival with regard to her mother's present
                  place of residence, and had learned that she still lived near Jersey City. She had
                  also learned that her brother was at home, and she had thought it advisable that
                  he should call upon her at the hotel before she went home, in order that he might
                  be able to break the news of her arrival to her mother. She made brief allusion to
                  the visit of the young midshipman to Annabon, and explained the nature of the
                  letter which in a state of nervous excitement she had sent him by the hand of Miss
                  Herbert.</p>
               <p>It was little wonder the young man was agitated, and that his hand trembled and
                  his pulse beat rapidly, and his cheeks alternately flushed and turned pale; but,
                  having read the letter, he resolved to visit the hotel and see his long-lost
                  sister before he explained the nature of the news he had received to his
                  mother.</p>
               <p>Hastily preparing himself for the walk, he re-entered the parlor where the widow
                  was still sitting, anxiously awaiting his return, and pondering over the probable
                  nature of the news which had so agitated her son.</p>
               <p>"Mother," said he, "I must go over to New York, immediately. I shall not be long
                  absent, and when I return, I will show you the letter I have received."</p>
               <p>"Why not now, Tom?" said Mrs. Miller, "surely there is some bad news. My boy, you
                  are ordered to sea again?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know that I ought to consider that bad news," said Tom,
                  smilingly—"though I should be sorry to leave you goon, as I expect to be at home
                  at least six months; but, set your mind at ease on that score. The letter, as I
                  have already said, does not relate to me personally at all; and so far from<pb
                     n="424-425" xml:id="VAC7191-00000220"/> being the bearer of bad news, the
                  intelligence it contains, will, if I mistake not, gladden your heart."</p>
               <p>"Then, why not satisfy me now, Tom?" reiterated the widow.</p>
               <p>"I wish to be sure that the good news is true first, mother."</p>
               <p>"Is it anything about Jane?" asked the widow, her voice trembling as she spoke,
                  and her countenance assuming an expression of intense anxiety.</p>
               <p>"Dear mother, wait until I return, and then you shall know all," replied Tom;
                  "Good by, I shall be back before dinnertime:" and, without giving the anxious
                  widow time to put any more questions, he left the parlor, and the next minute was
                  hurrying towards the ferry.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Miller was fain to content herself with his promise to return speedily, and
                  communicate to her the gratifying intelligence he alluded to.</p>
               <p>"What <emph>can</emph> it be?" said she to herself, as, after he had gone, she sat
                  down on the sofa, and fell into a brown study; "I should be certain it was an
                  appointment to some ship, if Tom had not told me positively it was not, and I know
                  he would not tell me a falsehood. Can he have heard anything with regard to Jane?
                  No; poor, dear girl," and the widow shook her head, and a tear rolled down her
                  cheek, as she thought of her lost daughter. "No: I shall never hear anything of
                  poor Jane, again, I wonder now," thought the widow, in her simplicity and her
                  ignorance with regard to nautical matters, and the slow progress of promotion in
                  Uncle Sam's national marine—"I wonder, now, whether Tom hasn't done something or
                  other very gallant and brave, while he was away at sea, which he has been too
                  modest and bashful to tell me of?" (Oh! Widow Miller, Widow
                     Miller—<emph>your</emph> son, Tom, too modest and bashful! Those are failings
                  or virtues, call them which you please, that your darling son is not troubled
                  with.) "I shouldn't wonder, now, if he has," repeated the widow, "and they're
                  going to make a lieutenant of him, right away. He'll buy himself a pair of
                  epaulettes, if it is so, before he returns home, and present himself to me in his
                  new finery; that's it, depend upon it," and the widow roused herself from her
                  brown study, confident in her own mind that she had shrewdly fathomed the mystery
                  of her son's behavior, and set herself to work at the daily routine of her
                  domestic duties.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Tom reached New York, and hastened to the —— Hotel It was a moment of
                  intense feeling to him, that moment, when, led by the waiter, he tapped at the
                  door of the room occupied by his sister. A voice—a voice he readily recognized,
                  albeit it sounded somewhat tremulous and husky, bade him enter. He turned the
                  handle of the door; it swung open. He stood in the room—in the presence of his
                  long—lost sister.</p>
               <p>"Tom, dear Tom!" she exclaimed, and rushed into his arms, hanging about his neck,
                  as though she were fearful she should lose him again.</p>
               <p>"Dear, dear Jane!" answered Tom, from the innermost depths of his heart. It was
                  all he could say; and his manhood forsook him, and he sobbed aloud. For some
                  moments the brother and sister clung speechless in each other's embrace, mingling
                  each other's tears. Then came the explanation. Jane confessed how she had become
                  foolishly infatuated with Seymour, at the same time exonerating him from all
                  blame; for though he had shown a marked partiality for her society, he had not
                  spoken of love. The interview at Annabon was talked over, and an hour had elapsed
                  before the re-united brother and sister thought of the flight of time. Then Jane
                  besought her brother to carry her to her mother.</p>
               <p>"Will <emph>she</emph> forgive me, Tom?" she asked. "Will <emph>she</emph> not be
                  angry with me for leaving her in the unnatural manner I did?"</p>
               <p>"She will," replied Tom. "Dear Jane you know not how deeply she has mourned over
                  your supposed death. How she has longed for some token that she might always wear
                  about her to remind her of you. For a long time she wore a ring, supposed to have
                  been that given to you by Captain Seymour, and found upon the finger of a floating
                  corpse, in the Hudson, which we all imagined to be your mortal remains; but lately
                  we have discovered that the corpse was that of a young lady of the name of
                  Donaldson, who with her father was upset from a boat in the Hudson about the
                  period of your disappearance. Since then our mother has restored it to the aunt of
                  the poor young lady, who, by the way, is a relative of Captain Seymour's. All this
                  I will explain to you another time. Now, dear, get ready, and I will hire a
                  carriage, and we will go home together. How rejoiced our mother will be when we
                  arrive."</p>
               <p>"Then she knows not of my return?" said Jane.</p>
               <p>"No," replied her brother, "I thought it advisable to keep her in ignorance of the
                  contents of the letter until I had seen you. Such strange events; such apparent
                  mysteries have transpired<pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC7191-00000221"/> spired, that,
                  until I saw you with my own eyes, I refused to credit even the assertions in your
                  own handwriting."</p>
               <p>The carriage was brought to the door of the hotel, and the brother and sister
                  entered and were driven rapidly to Jersey City. They reached the cottage and the
                  carriage stopped opposite the gate.</p>
               <p>"Stay inside, Jane," said Tom. "I will go in and break the intelligence of your
                  return to our mother" and he alighted from the carriage and opened the gate. Mrs.
                  Miller had heard the approach of the carriage wheels, and had opened the door of
                  the cottage herself, anticipating her son's return.</p>
               <p>He came not with the new epaulettes of the lieutenant's grade upon his shoulders,
                  as the widow had so simply anticipated, and in answer to her question whether he
                  had obtained promotion, for she still adhered to the fancy she had conceived, he
                  replied:</p>
               <p>"No matter; I told you that the letter had no reference to me. Come into the
                  parlor," and taking her by the arm he led her into the room.</p>
               <p>"Mother" he said, "I have all along told you that I did not believe Jane was dead,
                  or had even left us for ever. I said she would some day return to gladden us."</p>
               <p>"Then it was of Jane that letter told?" almost screamed the widow.</p>
               <p>"It was."</p>
               <p>"And you have heard news of her?"</p>
               <p>"I have."</p>
               <p>"Tell me, Tom, my son, tell me at once. I can bear it. She is well?"</p>
               <p>"She <emph>is</emph> well, and I have seen her."</p>
               <p>The widow gave vent to p piercing shriek and fainted in the arms of her son, who
                  led her to the sofa and carefully rested her upon it.</p>
               <p>Jane had heard that shriek, and unable to contain herself any longer, she had
                  alighted from the carriage—opened the gate of the avenue which led to the
                  cottage—rushed up the gravel walk—entered the cottage, and in another moment was
                  kneeling by the prostrate form of her mother.</p>
               <p>In the course of a few moments the widow began to show symptoms of recovery. "Was
                  it a dream?" she said, passing her hand across her brow, "or did they tell me Jane
                  had returned?"</p>
               <p>She opened her eyes and beheld both her children bending over her. Her emotions
                  again overpowered her—excess of joy is more prostrating than excess of grief—and
                  she closed her eyes and relapsed into unconsciousness; but she lay in this
                  condition but for a few moments. Again she opened her eyes, gazed earnestly upon
                  her children, as if to assure herself that it was indeed their loved faces she saw
                  bending over her; her lips moved as if in prayer, and then she exclaimed aloud as
                  tears rushed to her relief and gushed from her eyes:</p>
               <p>"Thank God! she that was lost is found. He hath restored my child to me again.</p>
               <p>She clasped the returned prodigal in her embrace, and the long separated mother
                  and daughter mingled their tears together, while both were speechless from excess
                  of emotion. Tom stood aside, and turned away his head, unable to witness the happy
                  greeting.</p>
               <p>By and by, the re-united family became more composed, and when able to control
                  their feelings, the long story of Jane mysterious absence was told. So passed the
                  remainder of that happy day, in the family of the widow Miller. Jane felt a
                  delicacy in meeting with those she had known before she left home. She felt no
                  particular friendship for them, for she had, in consequence of her poverty, been
                  treated by them with neglect and contumely, and Mrs. Miller, whose circumstances
                  were now comparatively easy, resolved to remove to a distant place and at Tom's
                  suggestion, it was determined that the family should pay a visit to Camden, where
                  his old shipmate Frank Martin and—his sister, Sarah, lived.</p>
               <p>Leaving them, for the present, to prosecute their journey, let us revert to Mr.
                  Mordant and his family, whom we have for some time lost sight of.</p>
               <p>From the hour when the fortunes of Mr. Mordant reached their culminating point;
                  and the loss of the Dolphin and the Albatross; the elopement of his daughter with
                  the music master; the discovery of the fraud with regard to Mrs. Miller's estate;
                  the reckless and scandalous behavior of his son, and various other minor matters,
                  all rushing, crowding upon him at once, with the terrible and irresistible power
                  of an avalanche, this gentleman, who had so long held a position of eminence in
                  the fashionable and influential circles of the city, felt that one after another
                  the stilts which had supported him were giving way. His wealth had been great; but
                  it had, in consequence of unsuccessful speculations, he had entered into
                  unadvisedly with the hope of repairing the damages that his fortune bad sustained,
                     became<pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC7191-00000222"/> less and less, and he foresaw
                  that unless he retired with the remnant of his fortune, he stood a good chance of
                  losing it all. He had been compelled to pay ten thousand dollars to Mr. Dixon, the
                  father of the girl whom his son Charles had so basely betrayed, or sought to
                  betray, though he had, happily for the young woman, been deceived. He had again
                  been compelled largely to fee parties at Sierra Leone, who were conscious of his
                  derelictions. Mr. Harvey had absconded with a large amount of his money which he
                  held in trust, after having pretty well feathered his nest with pickings from the
                  merchant's pockets, in the way of <emph>legitimate</emph> business, and the last
                  that was heard of him he was in Europe, living on the Continent in great style.
                  Charles Mordant had contracted new debts, not in the most honorable manner, which
                  the father, to preserve his own waning reputation, was compelled to pay. Miss
                  Dixon, as we will still call her, for she was Charles Mordant's wife only in name,
                  had succeeded in obtaining a divorce, and, to hush up the prejudicial reports
                  which would otherwise have got abroad, the merchant was compelled to pay down,
                  handsomely to lawyers of low reputation, and reporters, editors, and others, of
                  still lower. To save his daughter's elopement from involving him in disgrace, he
                  had been compelled to take her home, and to pay the music-master liberally, and
                  provide him with a situation to insure his secresy; for, although this scoundrel
                  was obliged to keep out of the way, in order to evade the stern penalty of the
                  laws he had outraged, he had the effrontery to threaten his father-in-law with
                  exposure, aye, and would have had the hardihood to expose him, too, had his
                  threats been unheeded. All these, and other misfortunes, had compelled Mr. Mordant
                  to give up business while he had any business left to give up, and to retire to a
                  small estate in the West, which he purchased with the remnant of his fortune,
                  where, for the remainder of his life, he will probably languish in obscurity and
                  comparative poverty.</p>
               <p>His second daughter, educated after a similar fashion, and possessed with the same
                  romantic sentiments as her sister, failed to take warning by her, and married a
                  quack doctor and itinerant lecturer, who happened to visit the village where the
                  broken-down merchant had located himself; and with him she went still further
                  West, and has not since been heard of. Charles Mordant, his father having refused,
                  actually because he was no longer able, to supply his extravagances, at last
                  persuaded the old gentleman to raise him sufficient money to carry him to
                  California, where, shortly after his arrival there, he perished in a drunken brawl
                  in San Francisco. Sarah is still at home and, having learned experience from her
                  former misfortunes, she promises yet to retrieve herself, if she can only escape
                  from the meshes in which, by her false step, she has entangled herself. She
                  devotes herself to the household duties of the farm and being a really
                  good-looking girl, a wealthy though uneducated young farmer of the vicinity has
                  fallen over head and ears in love with her. He knows nothing of her former
                  history, and was somewhat taken aback when, upon making her an offer of his heart
                  and hand, he received a respectful refusal, for he feels confident she loves
                  him—and so she does, in truth; and should any lucky chance put an end to the
                  career of her rascally and dissipated husband, she will, no doubt, eventually
                  accept the hand of the honest farmer.</p>
               <p>As to Mrs. Mordant, she sits day after day, the whole livelong day, in a
                  rocking-chair, brooding upon the misfortunes that have befallen her family, and
                  laying all the blame upon her husband, who, poor man, leads a wretched life,
                  troubled as he is with the reproaches of his wife, as well as with the small,
                  still, yet constantly reproving voice of his Own conscience. He thought he was
                  making a great figure in the world, and so he was; but when his affairs begun to
                  assume a downward tendency, and his former friends found that he was no longer
                  possessed of the wealth he once had, it was astonishing how soon he was forgotten.
                  So far from being the pillar of society he vainly imagined himself to be, he found
                  that he was not missed from the structure when he was compelled to withdraw
                  himself, and that his very existence was forgotten. He is just beginning to see
                  the folly, wickedness, and vanity of his past career—beginning to see it at a late
                  period of life, certainly;, still, let us hope he will benefit by the retrospect.
                  Here we will leave him to that painful retrospect, and, we trust, to
                  repentance.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Miller and her son and daughter visited Camden, as we have stated was their
                  intention. The place so pleased the widow, who found an agreeable companion in
                  Mrs. Martin, that she determined to sell her property in New Jersey, and purchase
                  a farm near that occupied by the Martins. She was much influenced in this matter
                  by her son, who has fallen deeply in love with Sarah Martin. Sarah, too,
                  reciprocates the affections of the young sailor, and, on his return from his
                  present cruise to the Japanese Islands, she is to become his wife.</p>
               <p>We have mentioned that a divorce from Charles Mordant<pb n="430-431"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000223"/> had been obtained by Miss Dixon, and shortly
                  afterwards, at the request of Mrs. Margin; the request being urged at the instance
                  of her son, she paid a visit to Camden, and she and Frank Martin, who is now a
                  steady farmer, were very soon engaged to each other. Prank said he needed a wife
                  to manage the domestic duties of the farm, and; as he would brook no delay, they
                  were married within three months after the visit was made, and oil the same day
                  William Martin and Jessica Deane were united.</p>
               <p>William is settled near Augusta, where he has gone into business on his own
                  account, and promises one day to become a thriving lawyer.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Donaldson, who we hinted had learned that the drowned female, found floating
                  in the Hudson, and supposed to be Jane Miller, was her unfortunate niece, and who
                  was satisfied that her brother had likewise perished, is still living at Camden,
                  and has made a will, bequeathing all her large property to William, Frank and
                  Sarah, Martin, her grand nephews and niece—thus, when she dies, they will be
                  amongst the wealthiest families in the State of Maine.</p>
               <p>As to Jane Miller she has declared her intention never to marry. It is evident to
                  her friends that she was really strongly attached to Seymour: and in spite of all
                  that has passed—in spite of her knowledge of his character, and the hopelessness
                  of her love, she cannot efface his image from her memory; The scene she witnessed
                  on Zuleika's Isle had a marked influence upon her. She is inclined to melancholy,
                  and is fond of walking alone in the sea-shore and brooding over past
                  recollections. It has, however, been noticed that she has of late been joined in
                  her walks as it were, accidentally, by a young physician, who has lately commenced
                  practice in the vicinity, and who has a strange fancy for gathering sea shells,
                  just at the hour when Jane wanders on the beach. He has been instructing Tier in
                  the science of conchology, and there are shrewd whispers abroad that she is an apt
                  pupil, and is also taking lessons from the same gentleman in another science. We
                  should not at all wonder if before long Jane Miller became Mrs. Doctor——somebody.
                  We won't say whom.</p>
               <p>Captain De Sylva made a successful market at Odessa and a quick passage home to
                  Oporto; and on his arrival home he introduced Marie to his parents. We are not in
                  the secret with regard to what happened on the passage home, or as to where the
                  courtship commenced; but a fortnight after the arrival rival of the Petrel at
                  Oporto, Dom Sebastian De Sylva and Mademoiselle Marie Wilson were made man and
                  wife at the Cathedral of Oporto.</p>
               <p>We learnt the news through a letter which was received by her sister Louise, in
                  which she mentions how happy she is, and how dearly she loves her generous
                  husband, and she also invites her sister to visit her in Portugal. Her husband has
                  left the sea, and she says he has promised to make the tour of Europe with her.
                  She wishes her sister to accompany her, and Louise is inclined to do so; but at
                  present she is unable, as her guardian keeps her very close. However, his health
                  is failing, and should he die, she will be her own mistress, and the possessor of
                  great wealth. Then she has resolved to visit her sister, and has written her to
                  that effect. Captain De Sylva blesses the hour when he fell in with his Marie on
                  the door step of the hotel, on that stormy night, at New Orleans. They have given
                  Julia, Zuleika's old nurse, a home with them.</p>
               <p>For a long time after the return of her daughter, it remained a mystery to Mrs.
                  Miller as to who was' the author of the anonymous letters she received at
                  different times after her daughter's disappearance; but the mystery was at length
                  unravelled. A letter, which, shortly after the family had quitted New Jersey, had
                  been sent to the cottage in which they had lived, was forwarded to their new abode
                  in Camden. It was in the well remembered handwriting of the anonymous scribe, who
                  requested an interview with Mrs. Miller or one of her family. She stated that she
                  was dying of consumption in the New York Hospital, and no time was to be lost if
                  they wished to hear further from her.</p>
               <p>Young Miller was in the city of New York on his way to join the ship, in Commodore
                  Perry's squadron, to which he had been appointed, and he paid a visit too the
                  hospital and asked for the inmate, who had in her last letter signed herself "Mary
                  Edwards."</p>
               <p>He found her in the ward appropriated to persons suffering from consumptive
                  complaints.</p>
               <p>"You are the son of Mrs. Miller, and brother of Jane Miller, who disappeared from
                  home some time since?" said she.</p>
               <p>"I am," replied Tom.</p>
               <p>"I am dying," said the poor girl, "but before I die I wish to clear up that which
                  otherwise may remain a painful mystery. I am the daughter of a farmer who resided,
                  in New Jersey—where, I will not say—it does not matter. I met with Captain<pb
                     n="432-433" xml:id="VAC7191-00000224"/> Seymour in New York, and, attracted by
                  his many fascinations, I fell in love with him, madly, hopelessly. I knew this
                  from the first—that is to say, from the first time I was so weak as to let him
                  perceive that I loved him; still I could not leave him; I haunted his footsteps; I
                  followed him and watched him when he knew not that I was near; I witnessed his
                  attentions to your sister, and the thought that he loved her maddened me; I saw
                  them together the day previous to her departure from home; I was concealed in the
                  grove where they were walking, and I heard all that passed; I knew
                     <emph>then</emph> that Seymour did <emph>not</emph> love Jane Miller; still he
                  did not love me, and I hated her to whom he showed so much more attention: I
                  watched her closely, and knew of her disguise; I could have betrayed her, but I
                  did not, because I hoped Seymour would, and so I should be revenged. I was driven
                  to insanity, and in that state I penned those letters, scarcely knowing what I
                  wrote, or what was my object, unless it was to make others as wretched as myself.
                  I wished to render her miserable, and at the same time to detach her from Seymour.
                  Since that time I have lived a life of poverty, earning my bread as a seamstress,
                  until the disease, which months ago attacked me, rendered me powerless to earn it
                  any longer. Then I was admitted here. I shall not live through another day. I feel
                  that my last hour is drawing near, and I have long felt that I could not die
                  happily, unless I had unburthened my mind of this deceit."</p>
               <p>The poor girl fell back upon her pillow exhausted, and deeply moved with the
                  distress he had witnessed, the young midshipman left the hospital. He departed for
                  Norfolk that evening, but before he sailed he wrote a letter to his mother and to
                  Jane, informing them watt the unhappy girl had told him.</p>
               <p>We have only now to Mate what we know of the fate of Seymour and one or two others
                  who have figured in our narrative, and then our task of many weeks duration will
                  be at an end. But we shall make this relation the subject of another and a
                  concluding chapter.</p>

               <p>SEYMOUR arrived with the caravan at Moscow; but neither the diversity of scenery
                  nor the change of habit were able to banish from his memory the recollection of
                  his past career, the tragical end of his beloved Zuleika, nor the image of his
                  child whom he had nursed in his arms in the evening, full of life and health and
                  infantile glee, and whom in the morning he had seen a corpse. These thoughts
                  haunted him in his waking moments and in his dreams; night brought no rest, day no
                  respite to his mental sufferings.</p>
               <p>From Moscow he journeyed to St. Petersburg, and thence travelled into Austria,
                  whence he still pursued his way southward into Italy. He had, it would seem, a
                  purpose in view from the moment he had quitted Russia; for his journeyings
                  thenceforward were not marked by the vascillation which had characterised them
                  through that country. His course from St. Petersburg until he arrived at Parma, in
                  Italy, was as direct and as rapid as he could render it.</p>
               <p>At Parma he hired obscure lodgings, mingling neither with the inhabitants nor with
                  the numerous foreigners who visited that city, though it was soon spread abroad
                  that he was possessed of wealth; for the cormorants, who seek to prey upon the
                  unwary in those cities, which are much visited by strangers, seem to have an
                  intuitive faculty of discovering the possessors of wealth, however they may seek
                  to hide it, as easily as the vulture scents the blood of its victims.</p>
               <p>Seymour, however, spurned all overtures that were made to him to induce him to
                  mingle in society, and soon finding that it<pb n="434-435"
                     xml:id="VAC7191-00000225"/> was useless to waste time upon him, he was left to
                  himself, and forgotten.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>About six months after his marriage to Miss Dixon, Frank Martin resolved to visit
                  the continent of Europe with his bride, Mrs. Donaldson was very partial to him,
                  amply providing him with funds for that purpose. He landed in England, thence
                  travelled through France into Italy, stopping a few days at any city or locality
                  famed for its historical associations, or which particularly pleased his fancy.
                  However, as his tour was to be a brief one, he hurried to Italy, which country his
                  wife wished particularly to visit.</p>
               <p>They had travelled from Milan to Parma, where Mrs. Martin, feeling fatigued with
                  her journey, expressed a wish to remain a few hours, although it had been their
                  intention to hasten on to Florence as quickly as possible.</p>
               <p>Leaving his wife resting upon a couch in the hotel at Which they had put up, Frank
                  strolled through the city for the purpose of amusing himself and passing away the
                  time.</p>
               <p>He found, however, little to attract his attention, except the churches, and of
                  these he had seen so many, that he began to weary of them.</p>
               <p>"Have you nothing worthy of the inspection of a traveller in this place?" he asked
                  of a barefooted friar, who had conducted him over a cathedral.</p>
               <p>"Signor, yes," replied the friar. "We have a monastery a mile pr two beyond the
                  gates of the city, worthy of your excellency's notice——"</p>
               <p>"Bah! a monastery!" exclaimed Frank in a tone of disgust. I am sick of eternally
                  visiting monasteries and churches and convenes."</p>
               <p>"But this is worth a visit, signor," returned the friar. "The grounds are
                  entensive and admirably laid but. Your excellency will be delighted."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, call a carriage, and let us proceed thither," said Frank, yawning
                  with <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui.</foreign> "The drive will servo pass away an
                  hour at any rate."</p>
               <p>In the greedy hope of extracting an additional fee from one who had already feed
                  him so handsomely the friar was not long in procuring a rickety conveyance, in
                  which he and the <hi rend="i"/>Millord Americano, as termed his companion,
                  proceeded to the monastery in question.</p>
               <p>"Can we alight and walk over the grounds?" said Frank, growing somewhat interested
                  as they drew near the spot. "The grounds of this place do seem more interesting
                  than; those of most monasteries I have seen."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Excellency; by paying a fee to the porter at the gate, you can enter
                  with me, and wander freely over the grounds. Another fee to the porter inside will
                  procure you ready admission into the monastery."</p>
               <p>"A fee, of course!" said Frank. "Nothing; an be done here without a fee. Giro
                  ahead, then."</p>
               <p>The entrance fee was paid. Frank and his guide alighted from the crazy vehicle
                  which had brought them from the city, and together they walked over the
                  grounds—the friar, though a sycophant and little better than a mendicant, being
                  really a very shrewd, intelligent guide, and being especially well posted upon all
                  matters connected with the churches and religious houses.</p>
               <p>"I should like to visit the interior of the monastery," said Frank, after they had
                  promenaded the grounds until he began to feel weary; and on the payment of a
                  second fee they were, as the Mar had said they would be, readily admitted.</p>
               <p>It was a stupendous, gloomy pile, and Frank soon grew tired of wandering about
                  amongst the dark corridors, paved with stone, and having cells on either side let
                  into the walls.</p>
               <p>There was no variety—nothing to attract the attention, save that now and then
                  tall, gaunt figures, wrapped in cowls and robed in gowns of coarse serge, would
                  flit noiselessly by them, like ghosts; and Frank was on the point of leaving the
                  place when, just as one of these ghostly objects was passing by him, in the centre
                  of a long, dark passage, the lantern that he held in his hand disclosed such
                  portions of his face as were not covered with the cowl.</p>
               <p>Frank glanced at the face, and then, starting back suddenly, with difficulty
                  suppressed an exclamation of surprise. It appeared that he, too, was noticed by
                  the ghostly father, for the latter also started, and, crossing himself devoutly,
                  muttered a prayer, and passed hastily into a cell, securing the door behind
                  him.</p>
               <p>"What is the name of that monk?" asked frank of his conductor. "You appear to know
                  every one here. is that man? I have seen his face, I think, before.</p>
               <p>"May be, your excellency;" replied the friar, who never ventured to contradict his
                  patrons. "May be that holy man<pb n="436-437" xml:id="VAC7191-00000226"/> is
                  called Father Georgius; he has been here but a short time."</p>
               <p>"What countryman is he? He is not an Italian."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="ITA">Signor</foreign> I do not know," replied the friar; "I
                  only know that he came to Parma some months since; that he lived in retirement,
                  and that he is rich, and more than that, he has resolved to leave his wealth to
                  the monastery, when he dies; that will not be long, for he is killing himself with
                  mortifications and scourgings. Ah! <foreign xml:lang="ITA">Signor,</foreign> truly
                  he is a holy man!"</p>
               <p>That was all that Prank could glean from the friar. He lingered about for sometime
                  in hopes that the monk would again come forth from the cell, but he waited in
                  vain, and at length getting weary and anxious to proceed on his journey, he
                  returned to the hotel at Parma, where he had left his wife.</p>
               <p>He told her that he had met with a priest in the monastery of Saint Giachimo, who,
                  he could almost be certain, was Seymour, so strongly did he resemble him. "But yet
                  it could not be," he added; "Seymour would never become a friar, besides even if
                  he did, he would not already be honored with the appellation, of 'Father,' and
                  according to the testimony of the friar who conducted me around the place, be
                  treated with so much respect and deference as this man is."</p>
               <p>"It is not likely that it is Seymour," replied Mrs. Martin; "but as to the
                  deference with which he is treated, and the rank he holds in the monastery, the
                  wealth—and Seymour has wealth—that can purchase indulgences, and immunities from
                  sin—is able to accomplish anything else in this country."</p>
               <p>Nothing further was said at the time. Frank and his wife visited Florence, and
                  Rome, and Naples, and three months afterwards again found themselves at Parma.</p>
               <p>"Do you know Jeannette," said Frank, after they had finished dinner at the hotel,
                  "I have a great fancy to visit that monastery again. I cannot get the idea out of
                  my head that that anchorite I met when we were here last was really Seymour. I
                  should like to learn something more of him, and to see him again if possible.
                  "Ha!" he suddenly exclaimed, "as good luck, will have it, there goes the very
                  mendicant friar who conducted me over the monastery on my last visit. Stay here,
                  my dear, until my return. I will not be long away; but I really must the monastery
                  once more," and, darting into the street, he seized the astonished friar by the
                  arm, and, slipping a piece of money into his hand, desired him to procure a
                  conveyance and again conduct him to the monastery of Saint Giachimo. Nothing
                  loath, the friar consented; the carriage was produced, and in the course of half
                  an hour, Frank again stood within the walls of the venerable edifice.</p>
               <p>"Is Father Georgius still an inmate of this monastery?" he asked of his guide; "if
                  so I should much like to see him, to speak with him if possible."</p>
               <p>The friar crossed himself reverentially.</p>
               <p>"Father Georgius has gone to heaven," he said; "daily mortifications of the flesh,
                  continual scourgings, and fasts, and nightly vigils, wore out the body of the holy
                  father; who has left his wealth to the monastery and has been canonized under the
                  name of St. Georgius;" and as he pronounced the name, the friar made repeated
                  crosses and genufluxions, and added—"he died in the odor of sanctity."</p>
               <p>"But," he continued, "on the payment of a fee, you can see the relics the holy man
                  has left behind him. They are daily visited by the faithful. One is a portrait of
                  the Holy Virgin, set in pure gold, so beautiful that it is not believed to have
                  been the work of mortal hands; the other is a faded rose, which was found attached
                  to the portrait, and both were lying beneath his robe, close to his heart. The
                  Abbot of the monastery asserts that the rose possesses miraculous virtues, for it
                  still preserves its fragrance, though enclosed in a glass case, which is never
                  raised."</p>
               <p>"I should, indeed, like to see these relics," said Frank; and, on payment of the
                  fee, he was allowed to visit the place where they were kept.</p>
               <p>He doubted no longer; the portrait of Zuleika was before him—that portrait which
                  more than once, when a cabin boy on board the Albatross, he had seen in the
                  possession of Seymour. Beneath it was inscribed—"<emph>I will
                  remember!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"What is the meaning of that inscription?" asked Frank of the friar.</p>
               <p>"These were the last words the holy man uttered," was the reply.</p>
               <p>Frank gazed long and earnestly upon the locket; the portrait was beautiful indeed,
                  and the original was pure as she was lovely; but little did Seymour, little did
                  Zuleika think, that that picture would ever be shown as the relic of a departed
                  saint, and as a portrait of the Holy Virgin, and, as such, be visited and
                  worshipped by thousands of devotees; and the rose—it was a faded white rose—and
                  strange to say, a strong perfume<pb n="438" xml:id="VAC7191-00000227"/> fume was
                  perceptible, even through the glass case in which it was enclosed!—but Frank
                  rightly suspected that artificial means were employed to create its seeming
                  fragrance.</p>
               <p>Frank left the monastery strangely impressed with what he had seen, and he
                  obtained permission for Jeannette also to see the relics before be quitted
                  Parma.</p>
               <p>They returned home—and the strange story furnished matter for much interesting
                  conversation, and led to many reminiscences of former days.</p>
               <p>"And the rose," said Frank one day, when he was speaking to Jane Miller on the
                  subject, "I wonder what could have made Seymour cherish a faded white rose so
                  fondly; or, perhaps, he did not carry it about his person; it may have been placed
                  in the cell as a relic, by the orders of the Abbot."</p>
               <p>"Seymour plucked a white rose from poor Zuleika's grave," answered Jane, "and
                  placed it in his bosom. I have no doubt he wore that rose next his heart until he
                  died."</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Reader, we have but a few words more to add.</p>
               <p>Shortly after Frank's return from abroad, a man, apparently a seaman, to judge
                  from his attire, was picked up in a state of destitution on Broadway, and carried
                  to the Bellevue hospital. Frank was passing by at the time, happening to be then
                  on a visit to New York; and although vice and intemperance, and disease and
                  starvation had almost effaced the human lineaments from the man's features, there
                  was something in the appearance of the poor wretch that led Frank to fancy he had
                  seen him before. He followed him to the hospital, and then he felt sure he was
                  correct in his surmise; the man was Tolcroft, the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ci
                     devant</foreign> mate of the Albatross. He partially revived, and lived for
                  some hours, and Frank talked with him in his more lucid moments, and obtained much
                  information respecting Seymour's career from him. But he died a raving maniac, and
                  his spirit took its departure from the body while a fearful blasphemy was still
                  lingering upon his lips.</p>
               <p>With a saddened heart the young man left the hospital.</p>
