               <p>IT was a warm, sunny afternoon. The fountains in the squares were pouring forth the sparkling waters; the green trees were waving in the breeze, and merry children were bounding along the smooth alleys-their white robes streaming after them, like wings-their long curls thrown back from their bright, animated faces-their thrilling voices, and their pealing laughter, calling up pleasant memories. Watchful and proud mothers gazed after each darling, as it danced and<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7216-00000005"/> sprang along; and if one fell and soiled its frock, or grazed its tender skin, great was the consternation: fathers, mothers, nurses, gathered round, and the little heedless companions, still panting from their play, looked on with large, earnest eyes, in which the tear was ready to start-each holding eagerly forth, to soothe the sorrow, some pretty toy; till gradually the loud sobs grew silent, the big tears were wiped away and stilled, by the tender caresses, promises, and bribes; followed by anxious, loving looks, the child again springs forth and joins the sportive group.</p> 
               <p>Not far from these children of love and luxury-almost within hearing of their ringing voices-in a little low garret, by the side of a miserable straw pallet, was also a young child.</p> 
               <p>But this creature, no less fair, filled with the same bright aspirations of childhood, was clothed in wretched, sordid rags, and sat still and patiently watching by the death-bed of her mother.</p> 
               <p>The sun had streamed all day on the roof, so badly closed, that sudden gleams of light, wounding the vision like flashes of lightning, came through the chinks. The sun's rays had heated without cheering-for the only window, all broken and mended with thick, coarse paper, looked on to an alley and a high brick wall.</p> 
                
               <p>Within the room, excepting the straw pallet, and a wooden chair, on which was a broken cup and a stone pitcher of water, there was no vestige of furniture. The little child sat on the floor, her knees drawn up, round which she had clasped her arms, laying her head upon them and gazing earnestly down at her mother.</p> 
               <p>There was neither sorrow nor fear in her large, brown eyes; there were no traces of tears on her clear, pale cheek; her attitude, her glance, the expression of her features, betrayed but one feeling, terrible in one so young-that of resignation-removed from hope and beyond despair.</p> 
               <p>The mother slept. Misery and illness had not effaced the traces of youth, and had still left some vestiges of beauty. The features, though now sharp and large, from the thinness of the face, were regular; her long, thick masses of raven hair flowed around her in disorder, as though some great spasm of pain had preceded this calm repose. Her thin hands were clenched, and her brow still contracted, spite of the unconsciousness of sleep.</p> 
               <p>Clara sat as still as the sleeper, her childish memory striving, through many ways, to recall other scenes, and other lands, which came floating by, like the moving panorama of a dream.</p> 
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7216-00000006"/> 
               <p>She was but nine years old; and the foreground of her pictured remembrances recalled none but scenes of misery and suffering. But there appeared to be times when she had seen her mother smile brightly; when she had seen her hair bound up with gay ribbons, and her form clothed in soft and silken robes. Then, too, the memory of another form, stooping to kiss her brow, and carrying her in his arms, rose before her-a form which in its fine proportions and with its dazzling glance, seemed to her like a vision of strength and power. But that passed away quickly-for her mother had forbidden such thoughts, and frowned when her child had mentioned them.</p> 
               <p>Then she stood on a high terrace, such as she had never seen here; and around her, above her, were tall marble palaces, and before her was a calm blue sea, with many white sails floating like birds over its surface; and the sound of merry bells and sweet music echoed in her memory, but again, like an echo, vanished.</p> 
               <p>She was sure, too, she remembered wearing pretty, soft muslin frocks, and small red shoes, for she could recall the image of her own little childish face in the bright silver buckles. And she remembered, too, sleeping on a soft pillow, and playing with the web of the lace around it-and the curtains, too, that enclosed her-she remembered them. But were these but memories of bright dreams she had dreamed on her straw pallet, pillowed on her poor mother's breast-or were they records of some truthful past?</p> 
               <p>She could not tell-what mattered it? If these visions amused her fancies, they seemed to bring deep sorrow to her mother; and she never recurred to them except when, as of late she had often done, she sat silent and alone, watching her sleeping mother.</p> 
               <p>But now, with a start, and almost a shriek, the mother awoke. Her glance met the calm, faithful, loving glance of her child; she threw her arms round her, and laying her head on the child's shoulder, moaned a low wail of pain and sorrow, as she pressed her closely to her.</p> 
               <p>At length she gently put the child from her, and raising herself, with much effort, gazed for an instant on her as she knelt by her side.</p> 
               <p>Silently they looked into each other's eyes, the mother and the child-each knowing the words of sorrow that were to be spoken, each dreading to hear them; for, young as the child was, she had grown familiar with pain and suffering, and she knew that there was death in the world.</p> 
               <p>The mother passed her hand gently over the smooth brow of her child, and murmured some words in a<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7216-00000007"/> foreign tongue. The child, though she uttered an endearing word in the same language-the language of Italy, so full of tenderness and love-replied not to what her mother said.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly, as though recalled from the past to the present by her child's caress, she burst into tears, and clasped her tightly to her bosom.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Clara! my own life's blood! Must I then leave you? Can it be that you are to be alone in a foreign land-in a land of strangers, whose language you scarce can speak? Oh, God! that you could die too! Why should his child live? Has he not deserted her-left your mother to die in want-me, his fair Ginevra, that he won from so many rivals? Ah, very fair is that Ginevra now!" and with an hysterical laugh, the woman threw back her hair from her damp brow, and stroked her bare, thin arm.</p> 
               <p>"Madre," said Clara, gently, "Madre mia."</p> 
               <p>Again the soft tones of her child recalled her to her senses; the evanescent fire disappeared from her eyes; the fever spot faded from her cheek; again she was calm and grave.</p> 
               <p>"Clara," said she, "do you know that I am about to die? Do you feel, my child, that for me to die, to leave poverty, suffering, the world, is God's greatest mercy-but to leave you, my poor, young, helpless, patient child alone, in all this <emph>new</emph> world, without one to shield you from starvation-makes me cling to the last remnant of life; makes me strive to still the wild throbs of this fluttering heart, and pray for life, with all its agonies! Oh, Clara, Clara! Come with me! Let one grave-a pauper's grave, for both, close over us! I cannot leave you! Scarcely have I saved you from starvation-scarcely have I sheltered your tender form from the biting frosts of this cold land, or shielded you from the burning sun of its ruthless summer. Joyless, cheerless, full of sorrow, have been the few years of your young life; and yet I was with you. Soon, soon, you will be alone. Oh no, I cannot, I cannot leave you!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mother," said Clara, looking up from her mother's bosom, to which she was clasped; "let me die with you; do not leave me all alone."</p> 
               <p>"My child, my child!" almost shrieked the poor mother, "that I had strength to rise from this wretched bed, and I would find such means as should take you from the woes of life to the joys of Heaven, gently, without pain or struggle. But to see you suffer, writhe in pain-to watch the life I gave, ebbing in agonies away-I cannot. No, Clara; you must live. Something I would say, to help, to guide you, to save you; but there is no time. The hour is come! Support<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7216-00000008"/> port me-hold me in your arms! My child! My brain whirls round-my sight is failing-I see nothing but those serene, earnest eyes. Each word chokes me as I utter it; and yet, I must tell you who you are. If you should live-if the world's charity, chance, or God, should save you from death and agony-you must know that; but I cannot utter more. Take the ring from my finger. I have kept it for you through all. In it is your father's name."</p> 
               <p>The child's frail arms could no longer hold the struggling form; it fell back on the hard pillow, and the cold dews of death were gathered on the brow. Cold, cold were the hands the poor child now clasped in hers, as tremblingly she drew off the broad silver ring from her mother's finger. She pressed them to her lips, she pressed them to her beating heart, and again her mother opened her eyes-again she spoke.</p> 
               <p>"Clara," said she, in a broken whisper; "tell him I was faithful to the last; tell him, oh, if you live to tell him, and his desertion does not kill you as it has me; tell him I forgave him. And, Clara," continued the dying woman, as a smile passed over her livid face; "never love but one-be true-be faithful-never love but one-your husband. You cannot understand now, but you will, girl, you will; and remember-never love but one! remember! And, Clara, do not forget your mother; my beautiful child, let my dead image stand in life between you and evil. Remember!"</p> 
               <p>Still she muttered on, but the words were indistinct; and Clara knelt by her, holding both her hands, gazing steadily at the changing face of death, till the hot tears streamed from her eyes and fell upon her mother's hands. Then again, instinctively and with a half consciousness, the mother's last looks sought her child; she saw her once again; but not as now she was, but in earlier years, when she had carried her in her arms, and stilled her infant wailings on her breast-happy days and full of tender thoughts, for a serene expression stole over the face, banishing the cold, gray tints of death. She half arose, gathered the passive Clara in her arms, and, lying down, placed her, pillowed on her bosom, beside her; then, with a beaming eye fixed on her child, who, awe-stricken, lay in her arms, she sang, as she rocked her feebly to and fro- <q>

                  </q> But lower and lower grew the tones of the low, soft voice; and the eyes, though they strove to catch life<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7216-00000009"/> from the steady, ardent eyes which looked into their depths, darkened and grew dim, then glazed; and the lips ceased to move, though parted still by a peaceful smile; and the arms ceased to rock; and with one deep gasp, the form fell back, and there, her living child within her arms, the mother lay, for ever still!</p> 
               <p>And the merry children left the cool, fresh square and their games, parting from each other with many a sweet kiss and a last joyous laugh. To happy homes went they; and kneeling by their mothers, they lisped forth a prayer to their "Father who art in Heaven;" and then, with the mother's kiss on their brow, they slept in their pretty cots. Later, shading the light from the tender eyes, the father bends over the sleeping child, who murmurs in its sleep some playmate's name, and laughs aloud, as again in dreams it bounds over the soft turf. So, hallowed with a father's blessing, these happy children rest by their mother's side; a happy morrow waits to greet them; and love and care are round them ever.</p>

               <p>NONE of all those happy, wealthy mothers thought of the want and suffering that was so near them; none, as they caressed their blooming children, remembered the careworn, eager faces of children that had so often appealed to them in the streets. Perhaps if they had, there were some who would have sent relief, some who would even have taken the little orphan to their homes-and a few, a very few, might have ventured into that sordid, miserable, broken tenement house, the eyesore of the fine new streets built up within the last few years, and have consoled the last moments of the unhappy mother.</p> 
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7216-00000010"/> 
               <p>But few, surrounded by wealth and happiness, remembered that there was sorrow and destitution in the world; so poor Clara lay by her dead mother, sobbing, but subduing her sobs-not that she feared to disturb her mother, for she knew she was at rest for ever; but she was awed by the solemnity of death, in whose clasp she lay.</p> 
               <p>She gazed upwards from her pallet bed, till the pale moonbeams streamed through the chinks, and one bright star, above a wider opening in the roof, appeared to look down calmly and brightly upon her. Weak and confused from want and sorrow, the child pronounced her mother's name, and felt as though her mother's spirit, passed into the happy Heaven above, watched over her from that star-the only bright, pure thing around her. The child had no fears, as yet, for the future; she formed no project, no plans; she thought not of what was to follow the event which left her thus alone. None of the dreary, worldly circumstances which wait on death arose in her inexperienced mind; but she felt very desolate, very sorrowful, and, oh, so weary, that nature at length had pity on her, and sent her soothing and oblivious sleep.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly, the creaking of her ill-closed door arouses her; she opens her eyes, and sees a form bending over her.</p> 
                
               <p>It is no angelic vision; nor are the features beautiful in anything but the loveliest of all expressions-human sympathy and pity, which radiated from the homely, rugged features.</p> 
               <p>Clara smiled-a smile to make the tears start in the eyes, had they not already been copiously flowing. The woman looked anxiously down, shading with a coarse, large hand, the light from a streaming, sputtering tallow candle, which was fixed in a broken bottle.</p> 
               <p>Clara smiled, for she knew the friendly face; it was that of a woman who lived on the floor beneath. She was an Irish washerwoman, and the mother of many little ragged, noisy children, whom Clara had often encountered on the stairs. Sometimes, though she scarcely understood their language, she had longed to join in their games; and as she sat in her lonely, dark room, waiting for her mother to return, their peals of laughter had cheered her, and made her feel less alone. But that was all-for her mother had forbidden her to leave the room in her absence; and when she returned, weary and suffering, Clara was content to sit beside her, watching her work; she had learned to thread the needles, and assemble the pieces for the shirts, which the mother made, to buy them bread. Once or twice, a chubby, dirty, ragged child,<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7216-00000011"/> had escaped from the overtaxed surveillance of the Irish mother, absorbed in her suds, and had, with wondering eyes, peeped in at the little girl that talked so strange, and that never played, and never cried, and whose mother never beat her. Once or twice, the delinquent had been violently snatched from the door by its mother; and on those occasions, Clara's mother had interceded for the screaming, kicking child-and so the acquaintance had been made.</p> 
               <p>Poverty needs no forms nor ceremonies-the one gaunt enemy brings instant alliance between its victims; so, much as Ginevra loved solitude, and reserved as she was, she could not avoid speaking to her neighbor, Mrs. Mullens.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Mullens was supposed to have rented but one room, that immediately under Ginevra; but her family was so large that it overflowed the small tenement meant to contain them, and in every neighbor's room-on the landing-on the creaking stairs-before the broken, dirty doorsteps-a child, owning Mullens for its name, and Judy Mullens for its mother, might invariably be found and captured.</p> 
               <p>Poor as Ginevra was, until the disease of which she knew she was dying actually confined her to her bed, she was not so poor as Judy, with her lazy, drunken husband and her six children. She had therefore often surprised the riotous, bare-footed tribe with some sweetmeat or cake, and thereby won the mother's heart.</p> 
               <p>When she had fallen ill, so ill that subsistence almost failed both the mother and child, Judy had helped them as she could, and once or twice had been the medium of selling the few objects of value Ginevra possessed, with which to stay starvation's hand.</p> 
               <p>There had never been much intimacy, for there was a difference in position and education instinctively felt by Judy-and besides, the foreign woman, "poor crathur," said Judy, "could spake but ill the English tongue."</p> 
               <p>Still, the poor Irish woman had often stolen up to see her neighbor, since she had been stretched helpless on her bed; and now that she had disposed of the riotous and rebellious crew, and cuffed and coaxed them into their beds, she began to feel uneasy at the utter absence of sound or motion in the room above, which the noise of the day had rendered till then totally inaudible; and so, after various efforts to leave her room, each greeted by a shout and a yell from some wakeful child, which roused the whole crew, she had succeeded at last in coming up to see if her fears were well founded.</p> 
               <p>"Slaping, is it ye are, my darlings?" said she, as she entered; but no reply came, and she stepped as<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7216-00000012"/> lightly as she could, across the floor. She bent down over the pallet, and there she beheld the poor, weary child, resting in the arms of its dead mother.</p> 
               <p>"Och! but it is slaping ye are, a slape that will have no waking. Holy Mother, but ye're gone, hinny! an' the saints have mercy on yer sowl! But the child, the craythur," said poor Judy; "to think on its lying by its dead mother! och! but it makes the <emph>crapes</emph> come over one! Wake up, hinny! come away-lave the dead to God-and come away!"</p> 
               <p>Clara, though the words were scarcely intelligible, understood the tone and look of kindness, and strove to rise; but the stiffened arm of the corpse was over her and held her down. Then first the horror of death, instinctive to our nature, came over her. She turned pale, and held her arms out imploringly to Judy. Gently setting down her light, and with almost superstitious awe, the woman removed the arm, and laid it reverently straight beside the corpse; then, freed, the child sprang towards the woman, and clasping her round the neck, burst into hysterical sobs.</p> 
               <p>Judy tried all she could to soothe her, and presently the child stopped, and turned with a look of remorse towards the corpse, on which the moon-beams streamed.</p> 
               <p>"Oh Madre! Mother!" said Clara, repeating the word in English, as she had heard the Irish woman's children speak it; "Mother!" said she, as though thus to tell her grief at once.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my darling, mother is the word, and there's none like it; and sorry is the hour ye spake it for the last time! But it's gone she is, and to Mary, Mother above, and we'll knale and pray for her!"</p> 
               <p>And there, by the side of that wretched bed, the orphan and her protectress knelt; the woman murmuring the church prayers for the dead, and the child finding but one word to send on wings of pitying angels to the throne of God-"Mother! Mother!"</p> 
               <p>Then Judy rose, advanced towards the corpse, and pressed a sister's kiss upon the brow of the stranger; and Clara, too, awe-stricken and exhausted, refrained from any warmer caress, but kissed reverently the cold and now livid lips; then she rose and was led unresistingly, by the sobbing Judy, from the room-having, though she knew it not, looked her last upon her mother.</p>

               <p>THE coroner came next day and made short work. Republican coroners and republican shop-keepers who go on juries, have no time to attend to the dramatic. The dead woman was a stranger and a foreigner, and appeared, from the evidence of Mistress Judy Mullens, her neighbor, to have died in utter destitution. She had rented the room only a few weeks before, and had been taken ill shortly afterwards. No servant, attendant, or friend, had been seen.</p> 
               <p>Under the circumstances, Mrs. Mullens went on to say, she had just done what she could for the poor craythur-and that, to be sure, was little enough, as she had to make the best use of her time at the wash-tub, to support her own children; as times were mighty hard, and her Johnny had not too good luck in getting work the evening before-when she came up, as usual, just to look in and say a comforting word to the sick woman, she just found her dead, as his honor's worship could see her for himself, and the little girl, her daughter, waking all alone by the corpse.</p> 
               <p>This statement was by no means made in the concise and perspicuous style in which we have undertaken to render it-following the illustrious example of Gibbon, in that most marvelous of historical romances, the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, who frequently puts the whole forty or fifty quarto volumes of some garrulous father into a single paragraph. The present was probably the first occasion in Mrs. Mullens' life in which she may be said to have fairly "come before the public;" and, called as she was, suddenly from the wash-tub to the august presence of the coroner and his twelve jurymen, she still was not, at this critical moment, deserted by that guardian genius of woman, personal vanity. On the way up stairs, she had managed to give her white cotton cap a jaunty Irish twist to one side, had wiped the suds from her red and well-shaped arms, on a corner of her apron, and smoothed the creases out of her striped petticoat, her regular washing-day<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7216-00000014"/> ing-day uniform. Her story was interrupted and embellished with innumerable expletives and episodes, and accompanied by frequent applications of the corner of the apron to the corner of the nearest eye, and with other becoming ways by which women in all situations, and of all ranks, except the very highest, instinctively make themselves objects of interest.</p> 
               <p>However, her statement, in its principal facts, was intelligible enough-and after Mrs. Mullens had left the room, the jury proceeded to give in their verdict, to the effect, as appeared in the lucid police columns of the next morning's papers, that "deceased had come to her death by reason of accidental death-cause or causes to the jury unknown."</p> 
               <p>Then-for there is no lying-in-state for paupers, who have had the bad taste to die without leaving behind them any thing to pay for their funeral-then quickly came the public undertaker, with his deal-board box for the dead body,-where it was doubtless as comfortable as if it had slept in a patent "burial case," moulded in the form of a bronze mummy, and lined with a white satin cushion. Then the apprentice-boy came up and helped to carry the burden down stairs and put it in the cart-the scant and dreary funeral procession drove away-and that was the last, on earth, of poor little Clara's mother. In all this bright, fair land, which had seemed to her young dreams a paradise of love and happiness, no hand had pressed hers-no tongue had pronounced her name.</p> 
               <p>It was evening-and still the little girl lay on the Irish woman's hearth, motionless. Several times the woman had vainly tried to rouse her; and growing at last impatient at her obstinacy, had left her alone, and resumed, with unusual vigor, her work, which, with all the novel incidents of the day in which she had taken a part, was very much behindhand.</p> 
               <p>Her husband Johnny now came home. He was a small, shaggy-headed, keen-eyed Irishman, with something of the appearance of a wild pony. His face had a shrewd, malicious expression, and his voice and manner were noisy and blustering, as if he felt it necessary to keep up appearances, and counteract the effect of his diminutive and insignificant person. His tone, however, was somewhat subdued as he came nearer his wife, and felt the influence of the control which she habitually exercised over him. His voice sank several degrees, and gradually fell away, like that of the imaginary gentleman in the ventriloquist's box, as the performer shuts down the cover.</p> 
               <p>"Judy, darlint," said her lord and master, almost in a coaxing tone, as he came up to her, where she still stood vigorously rubbing and thrashing the contents<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7216-00000015"/> tents of her tub; "Judy, is there ever a drop of whiskey in the jug?"</p> 
               <p>"Ye know that best yourself, Johnny-for it's the same as ye left it this mornin'. But wait a bit, Johnny-I'll just bring ye the jug myself-I'm sure ye must be main weary."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Mullens was not accustomed to accost her husband in quite so placable a strain-especially on the subject of the whiskey, to which she was in the habit of attributing the greater part of Johnny's bad luck in getting work. But she had been beating her brains while pounding her dirty clothes, and had a plan to submit to her husband, the success of which depended on his being in the best possible humor. So, shaking the suds from her hands, she went to the farther corner of the room, and diving into a small recess, brought out the article after which Johnny had inquired so tenderly.</p> 
               <p>"There, man," said she; "take your drap of whiskey, and much good may it do you!"</p> 
               <p>"Och, Judy, but it's yourself who is a jewel of a woman!" said Johnny, holding up the bottle, and finding that it was half full. "Will ye take a sup?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Johnny-don't tempt me. If I did, what would become of the childers?-for you know I can't stand the drink. But, Johnny, look here-do you see that poor craythur there in the corner-our neighbor's girl, up stairs, you know? She's been there all the day, greetin' as if she would never stop."</p> 
               <p>"Is it the woman's daughter up stairs, who spakes Indian, or some other haythenish stuff, that a Christian can't understand a word of? What's the matter wid her, thin?"</p> 
               <p>"Take yer dram, Johnny, and I'll tell ye all about it. You see, the poor thing up stairs died last night, and to-day, the coroner's jury and the coroner himself to the fore, with a power of fine gentlemen, came to sit on the body, accordin' to law. And so, the child there, who went claspin' her dead mother's neck, and fell to greetin', as if she would die too, at last came quietly with me, and just curled herself up there as ye see her."</p> 
               <p>The child, who had finally cried herself to sleep, was awakened by the voices, and raised her head, looking wildly around her at Johnny, whom she had never seen before, and then getting up, went to Mrs. Mullens, and took hold of her hand, as if for protection.</p> 
               <p>"What a purty thing it is!" said Johnny, examining her attentively. "Don't be afeard of me, my little jewel," he continued, coming nearer and taking her little soft hand; "I'll niver harm the hair of your head. And what, Judy machree, is to be done wid her at all?"</p> 
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7216-00000016"/> 
               <p>"She must just go to the alms-house, I'm thinking, Johnny," said Judy, in a tone of affected indifference, yet watching her husband as she spoke.</p> 
               <p>A bright idea seemed to have struck Mr. Mullens; but he concluded to keep it, whatever it was, to himself. So he only repeated,</p> 
               <p>"She's very purty."</p> 
               <p>"But what can we do for her, Johnny? You know that we have nothing for the poor thing?"</p> 
               <p>"I'm just thinking, Judy, that we could manage some way to carry her along wid us. She could help you to mind the baby, Judy; and she would do a nate thing in the streets. Sorry a one but would give a penny to such a purty little thing-only she can't spake to Christian people."</p> 
               <p>The kind-hearted Mrs. Mullens saw that her object was accomplished-she had got her husband to propose the very thing she wanted. She knew too well, however, the more than Irish combativeness of her husband, to seem too much pleased.</p> 
               <p>"I don't know, Johnny," she said. "She would be little good, I'm thinkin'. But ye know best."</p> 
               <p>"Hout, woman! I tell ye, she <emph>would</emph> do good. We'll try it, any how; and if she don't, she can go to the alms-house all the same."</p> 
               <p>"As ye will, Johnny. I'm sure I've taken a liking to the little thing, and I'll do me best. Where-I wonder where's the childers?"</p> 
               <p>"They'll be comin' directly."</p> 
               <p>Clara still looking and wondering very much-at Johnny, resumed her seat in the corner, and Mrs. Mullens commenced getting ready the supper. While she was busy in putting some plates and two or three dilapidated knives and forks on the table, the three oldest boys came in. They looked wild and shaggy, like their father. One brought an old basket containing some cold meat and broken bread-another had picked up a quantity of cinders and a few faggots-and the youngest deposited on the table, as his contribution, half a dozen pennies, which Johnny immediately took possession of, as master of the spoils, and deposited in his pocket-not, however, without a look of reproach and warning from his wife, to which he paid no attention.</p> 
               <p>The whole family, without further ceremony, now commenced an attack upon the food, and Judy went to fetch little Clara, who had not eaten during the whole of this dreadful day. Child though she was, her sufferings had quenched her appetite, and she shook her head, as she looked up at Judy with a thankful smile. The boys and the father eat and quarreled, like a company of hungry dogs, and the<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7216-00000017"/> peace was kept with great difficulty by Judy, with maternal impartiality. Clara looked on in silence; and when the supper was concluded, the children were tumbled promiscuously among the mattrasses and blankets in the corner, where they fought and quarrelled themselves to sleep. The baby was taken up, and after a sharp scramble with its mother, was disposed of for the night. Johnny, taking a farewell embrace of the whiskey-bottle, punched his hat over his head and disappeared-while Judy, having restored the dishes and the remains of the supper to the shelf, arranged the top of the invaluable chest for an ironingtable, and prepared to go on with her work, by the light of a dripping tallow candle.</p> 
               <p>By-and-by, little Clara got down from her seat, and came up to the table, standing silently by Judy's side, for a long time. At last, she pointed to the ceiling, and looking her benefactor earnestly in the face, said, in a tone of interrogation,</p> 
               <p>"Madre?"</p> 
               <p>Judy laid down her iron; and taking the poor little girl tenderly in her arms, carried her to the bed, and laid her softly down by her own baby's side. Then she looked long and wistfully at her-with her apron wiped a tear from her eyes, then turning away, resumed her occupation.</p>

               <p>IT was long before Clara recovered sufficiently, even to feel conscious of where she was, or of caring what became of her; yet, to her credit be it spoken, Judy left her to her sorrow, nor ever seemed impatient or cross at her tears, or wearied by her listless silence. The children, at first, wondering at the long continued tears of the strange child, had kept aloof, whispering amongst themselves comments on her behavior. Gradually, however, even a child's grief, the most truthful and sincere of all, yielded to the effects of time, and was lured from its intensity.</p> 
               <p>Clara's first attention was aroused by the advances of the round, fat baby, who crawled to her feet and<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7216-00000018"/> looked up with its large interrogating eyes, gazing fearlessly at her, till Clara stooped down to it and smiled; then the baby, clutching at the little girl's torn and faded dress, scrambled to its feet and crowed for joy; then Clara put her arms around it and set it on her lap, while the baby played with the tangled ringlets of her hair, she buried her face in its little soft neck, and a feeling of gentle, holy peace and love hushed the sobs, which till now, had convulsed her young bosom.</p> 
               <p>For a day or two she and the baby sat together in the corner murmuring to each other like two birds, greatly to the admiration and much to the relief of Judy; and perhaps Clara was infinitely more useful in her self-assumed capacity of nurse, than she could have been in any other, in the heterogeneous household. The other children, however, from their peregrinations in the streets, and their invasions into the neighbors' not very edifying homes, were worldly wise and selfish. They became jealous of the placid tranquillity of the sunny corner, for the baby always crawled after the sun-beams, and Clara followed the baby. Constantly either scolded by their mother, or beaten by their father for their idleness, they turned upon Clara, whose quiet manner appeared like idleness, and vented their ill-temper upon her.</p> 
                
               <p>"It's purty thing to stay all day and play with a baby-ain't it, Sallie?" said the most insolent of the little girls-"and it's just what I would like too, instead of trailing through the hot, dusty strates to take home the washing, or to be sworn at, that the sharts is singed, and all because the mother is a taking care of strange gals."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and laving us to do the work," continued a graceless boy, lying flat on the floor, and pitching marbles at Clara's feet-"sure them that is kept from charity might work, I'm a thinking."</p> 
               <p>"And a purty lot o' work ye do," shouted Judy, "begging pennies in the strate, and spending 'em in marbles, whin yer mother's a slaving ov herself to death to fade ye all, ye graceless varmint."</p> 
               <p>"Thin ye shouldn't take any more children whin yer own flesh and blood is too much for ye, mother, and that's all."</p> 
               <p>Judy, accustomed as she was to the insolence of her "olive branches," declined farther parley, and settled the dispute by throwing a pail of water on the head of the last speaker, which caused a universal howl, when Johnny Mullens entered on the scene of action.</p> 
               <p>With an Irishman's instinct, seeing there was a row, he began by hitting right and left-knocking one<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7216-00000019"/> into one corner, and another into another, and then planting himself aggressively before his wife, he exclaimed-</p> 
               <p>"And, Mrs. Mullens, what have the childer done, that a Christian woman should have set thim a howling enough to waken the dead?"</p> 
               <p>"And sure they were giving me their sarce, Johnny Mullens, and I'm a thinking-"</p> 
               <p>"You'd better be a working and giving me, yer husband, a little of yer earnings, just to kape me from the cholery in this terrible hot sason, and me not a sup."</p> 
               <p>"The mother has too many to work for," blubbered the red-headed boy, Paudeen by name, and a true specimen of the Irish <foreign xml:lang="FRA">gamin,</foreign> not the more civilized by having been born in the land of liberty, than if he had been produced on his native bogs-"she can work for strangers, but she grudges her own childer the very bread they ate."</p> 
               <p>"It's a lie, and ye know it," shouted Judy, making a drive at her eldest born with her red fist.</p> 
               <p>"It aint no such thing," bellowed Johnny, arresting the angry mother's progress-"what have ye forrin brats here a ating ye out of house and home, and all for nothing at all, at all?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, she's always a doing nothing," sobbed Judy's eldest daughter, an inveterate idler on door-steps, spending her time gazing in at confectioners' windows, wheedling pennies out of the unwary by her Irish whine-"and mother snubs us, but she never snubs her," and as she concluded, she pointed her finger at Clara, who thus comprehended more than by words, which she comprehended very little, that the discussion concerned her.</p> 
               <p>Johnny's return to his home was always a signal for Clara and the baby to retire into the furthest corner they could find; for Clara always felt an instinctive shrinking from the coarse, low, half-drunken Irishman; but now she caught his eye angrily fixed on her, and heard him pronounce her name in a tone of contempt-she advanced towards him and listened.</p> 
               <p>She could not understand all the absurd invectives and reproaches of the wild crew; but she comprehended sufficiently, from Judy's generous defence of her, that she was the cause of the quarrel. The blood mounted to her forehead, and tinged her pale, olive cheek, as the proud, independent instinct of her nature comprehended that the very bread she was eating was grudged to her, and that she was indeed an orphan and a stranger. She put the baby, who clung to her, gently on the floor, and throwing back her hair, she turned with flashing eye towards Johnny, and laying her hand on Judy's arm, she exclaimed-</p> 
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7216-00000020"/> 
               <p>"Work!-work!-anch io"-</p> 
               <p>Judy, with a look of triumph turned towards her husband-</p> 
               <p>"There," said she, "see, the craythur understands ye-ye ought to be ashamed of yerself, grudging the motherless craythur the sup and the crust, and she so fond of our bit of a baby."</p> 
               <p>"Work!" said Clara, "work, or go far, far away!"</p> 
               <p>"No, ye'll not go for away, honey, sure as my name is Judy; but ye shall work that ye may live in pace. Better for some as is so hard upon ye, that they worked too," added Judy, with an angry glance at Johnny-"and what can ye be after doing, poor, young thing? Ye can niver ask the gentles for pennies, wid that divil's spache of yer own! But it is a good thought, and wonderful that the child should come upon it." She continued-"I know what'll just do for ye, nicely. Here, Paudeen, give me the basket-it is the dacentest of the lot-and take this fip, and bring a dozen boxes of matches from the grocery-run, and do yer mother's bidding directly. Ye shall sell the matches, darling, for a cint the box, and that'll be a fip for yer day's work."</p> 
               <p>Clara waited patiently; and when Paudeen brought the matches, his mother put them in the basket, and then, holding a cent in one hand and taking a box of matches from the basket with the other, she gave the cent to Clara, and with a multitude of signs and motions, imparted to her the first lesson in that great and mighty science of life-the science of SELLING-which controls and governs the men, women, and nations of the nineteenth century.</p> 
               <p>Clara watched attentively the movements of her instructor, and tried hard to understand her. At length, her anxious little face cleared up, and she exclaimed,</p> 
               <p>"Daro i solfanelli de-what, what you call them? e poi mi daranno il denaro, monies, va bene?" holding up a box in her hand.</p> 
               <p>"Matches," said Judy, who understood the forcible gesture of the child, although not a syllable of what she had said.</p> 
               <p>Clara smiled and nodded; then taking her basket on her arm, made Judy a fantastic little courtesy, and ran out of the room.</p> 
               <p>When she had got a little way out of sight, she stopped to hold a consultation with herself as to her future proceedings. She was now a person of some consequence! She examined her basket and its contents with perhaps something of the feeling of the young shop-keeper who first looks at his well-filled shelves, whence untold profits are to flow into his money-drawer.<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7216-00000021"/> It must be confessed that her ideas of her new position and responsibilities were not very clear or very definite. She had a general notion that she was to give her matches to somebody, who would give her a great deal of money-how much, or how little, she did not know. Nor had she yet quite mastered the theory of the transaction. Her general impression, however, was, that it was a sort of exchange of courtesies, for the general promotion of good nature and happiness.</p> 
               <p>Having settled these points, to the best of her ability, she took up her basket, and walked quickly out of the narrow street, into which led the little lane where her home was situated.</p> 
               <p>On she went, crossing street after street, and looking carefully about her, as if seeking for the unknown somebody, who was to relieve her of her stock of matches, and fill her basket with money. Many people turned to look at her as they passed-for she was very pretty and striking, and looked much too neat and tidy for a match-girl. Her bright hair and clear blue eyes were shaded by a neat little old straw bonnet, tied under her throat with a faded black ribbon; and her cheeks, freshened by the fresh wind, and the excitement that made her little bosom beat with new emotions, were as gay as new plucked roses. In fact, Chestnut street had never seen so pretty a match-girl, and many were the looks of admiration and wonder that fell upon her as she tripped lightly along.</p> 
               <p>At first she thought of nothing but her matches, and of the unknown somebody who was to ask her for them. But soon the gayety and bustle of the street-the elegant ladies and doll-like little boys and girls who marched up and down the sidewalk, as if they had all been in a grand procession-the carriages with their beautiful horses dashing gallantly by-the brilliant shop-windows, with such tempting wealth of beautiful objects-attracted her attention, and roused the latent sense of luxury and pleasure. She forgot her own humble appearance and still more humble employment-she forgot the ragged basket with its store of matches-she forgot the straw bonnet and its rusty black ribbon-and began to feel as if she herself were a part of the gay pageant gliding and floating by. At length, the window of a toy-shop, more gorgeous and tempting than any she had yet seen, fairly conquered her, and she stopped to admire its manifold beauties, exclaiming, with a gesture of delight,</p> 
               <p>"Oh, come  bello!"</p> 
               <p>Lost in admiration, unmixed with a spark of envy or covetousness, she examined, one by one, all the treasures of this magnificent window. She murmured tender little words of endearment to the naked crying<pb n="50" xml:id="VAC7216-00000022"/> babies, almost as big as herself, who sat astride of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">papier mache</foreign> Parthenons, no bigger than work-boxes. She played in fancy with the gilt and many-colored India rubber balls, that lay piled like painted oranges in exquisitely pictured porcelain vases. She saw and smiled at a dozen reflections of her own lovely face, in little mirrors of all shapes and sizes; and was ready to go down on her knees to an exuberantly developed young lady in lithograph, extremely <foreign xml:lang="FRA">decolletee,</foreign> and labelled "Flora," whom she piously mistook for a little likeness of the Virgin Mary, she had seen with mamma, on the grand church altar. At this remembrance, tears came into her eyes, and all the brilliant window grew instantly dim. She suddenly bethought herself of where she was, and what she had to do; and drying her eyes as well as she could, turned away and hurried down the street-fearful lest he who was to give her the money for her matches, should have passed by without seeing her.</p> 
               <p>As she thus went quickly along, a little boy, nearly her own age, all tricked out in finery, like a monkey who is to ride the pony in the circus, and with his little bare legs bandy and blue, ran up to her, exclaiming to a magnificently caparisoned lady, whose side he had left-</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mammy, look here; what a pretty little match-girl!"</p> 
               <pb n="(Illustration)-51" xml:id="VAC7216-00000023"/>

               <p>Clara stopped, thinking that she had found the purchaser of her wares, and wondering at his being a child like herself.</p> 
               <p>But the grand lady now came up, and glancing furtively round to see that none of her fashionable acquaintances were passing, took the little fellow spitefully by the hand, and gave him so severe a jerk that he roared with pain, saying, in a shrill, cracked voice:</p> 
               <p>"Henry Augustus, what <emph>do</emph> you mean, you little wretch, stopping to talk with beggar girls in the street? Haven't you been brought up better than that? Come along this instant;" and with an air of overwhelming superiority, and a look of annihilation at poor wondering Clara, she dragged the boy off, to resume his grand promenade with his fine mamma.</p> 
               <p>The little fellow, however, struggled and kicked as well as he could; and as he was led off, turned his head and looked back at Clara, until he was lost to her in the crowd.</p> 
               <p>Clara now began to be much surprised and perplexed, that no one had yet appeared to relieve her of her matches, and looked eagerly round, and hurried briskly on, in search of her expected customer.</p> 
               <p>The day was wearing, and she had gone up and down many streets, and looked wistfully and inquiringly into many hundreds of faces; but all to no purpose<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7216-00000024"/> pose. Often the people stopped, or turned round, to look at her, but nobody spoke to her-nobody claimed her matches, or offered to fill her basket with the money which she somehow felt she was expected to bring home.</p> 
               <p>At length, when she was getting quite sad and despondent, and did not know at all what she should do, she met another little girl, much shabbier and coarser looking-than herself, who also had a basket half filled with matches. She stopped, determining to watch the operations of her rival in trade, and take advantage of what she should discover. The girl went on without noticing Clara, and at every few steps, cried with a loud, grating voice:</p> 
               <p>"Match-ees! Match-ees!"</p> 
               <p>As she passed the door of a shop, a man came out, and dropping some money into the basket, took away two boxes of matches. Clara followed on, carefully keeping far enough behind not to be noticed, until she had seen her rival dispose, in this way, of several boxes more, always repeating, as she went along, her doleful, monotonous cry:</p> 
               <p>"Match-ees! Match-ees!"</p> 
               <p>Clara listened intently until she had caught these magic syllables, which she repeated over and over again to herself, until she had firmly fixed them in her memory. Then, quite satisfied with the discovery she had made, she began to seek for her way home, as it was growing dark, and she was so hungry and weary, that she could scarcely walk.</p> 
               <p>Perhaps the same instinct that leads the birdling home to its nest at evening, impelled her steps, for she did not lose her way; and, after a long and painful walk, she opened the door timidly, and entered.</p> 
               <p>There was no one at home but Mrs. Mullens and the baby-neither husband nor children had yet arrived. Clara set her basket down disconsolately, and went up to Mrs. Mullens, saying, with a graceful, deprecating gesture,</p> 
               <p>"Non, ho fatto niente, ma"-she added, her eyes suddenly kindling, "tu vedrai, tu vedrai, domani-<emph>to-morrow!</emph> Si, to-morrow! Tu vedrai-mash-ee! mash-ee!" and, imitating as well as she could, the screech of her rival, she clapped her hands, leaping and skipping about the room, and exclaiming at every step-</p> 
               <p>"To-morrow! Mash-ee! Mash-ee! Tu vedrai! Si!"</p>

               <p>CLARA'S to-morrow, like all other to-morrows, whether Italian or English, duly came-a dull, dreary, rain-threatening day, which might clear up, or might fret itself into a regular pelting storm; and might, (which was more probable than either,) subside into a continuous sloppy, slippery drizzle.</p> 
               <p>However, match-girls, omnibus horses, and lawyers, have nothing to do with the weather; they must out, whether it is fair or foul. And so Clara and her basket, and her newly-acquired and doubtful English exclamation of "mash-ee!"-which was to be for her the <emph>open sesame</emph> to fortune-sallied cheerfully forth, and took her way confidently down Chestnut street, crying, at intervals, in a voice somewhat weak and tremulous, notwithstanding her courage,</p> 
                
               <p>"Mash-ee! Mash-ee!"</p> 
               <p>And so our little heroine took her promenade down Chestnut street.</p> 
               <p>The clouds have broken away, and it is a fine day in Chestnut street, and every body is out to criticise every body, and to be admired by every body. But little Clara does not stop to criticise or admire. She goes on, eagerly intent on her trade,-every now and then putting her head into a shop door, and crying softly, her</p> 
               <p>"Mash-ee!"</p> 
               <p>Often she is gruffly told to go along out of the way-but sometimes her talismanic syllables work their spell; the store of matches begins to decrease, while several cents are carefully piled up in the corner of the basket.</p> 
               <p>Clara's trade had prospered: her matches were almost gone, and she was tripping merrily along, thinking of the pride and pleasure she should have in laying her "assets" before Mr. and Mrs. Mullens and the boys-when the same little boy who had spoken to her the day before-with the same hat and feather, and the same blue legs and magnificent mamma-suddenly came up to her, and touching her elbow, gave her a piece of money, and with a little nod and smile, ran back to his mother.</p> 
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7216-00000026"/> 
               <p>It was a levy-and Clara, who did not know exactly how much it was worth, still felt sure it was greatly more valuable than the cents-and she thought herself quite rich. As the little boy and his mamma went by, she met his curious, earnest look, with a glance of gratitude, and murmuring "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">grazie!</foreign>" made one of her quaint little courtesies.</p> 
               <p>But Clara soon ceased to think of any thing but her successful speculation, and hurried home. As she turned into the narrow street, out of which ran the still narrower alley where she lived-she was met by two girls, larger than herself, and a stout, ugly-looking boy, whom she did not at first recognize to be Mrs. Mullens' eldest boy, Paudeen. When he came up to her, however, seeing who it was, she showed him her basket, with the money in the corner, the bright levy lying on the top.</p> 
               <p>The sight of the money suddenly aroused the fierce and unprincipled instincts of the savage. Rudely snatching at the basket-he called to his companions,</p> 
               <p>"Here, Biddy, by the powers, look-a-here! If the forrin gal hain't done it! Look-a-here! Silver and all! Give it to me, ye spalpeen-isn't it me own mother that belongs till it? Give here, I say!"</p> 
               <p>The girls gathered around-but Clara, frightened and astounded, fought stoutly for her basket-exclaiming ing, in her own language, that it was hers, and that she alone must carry it to Mrs. Mullens. She was no match for the boy, who was assisted by his companions, and amongst them, she was roughly treated. Her bonnet was torn from her head, her mouth cut and bleeding, from a blow of Paudeen's fist, and, worse than all, her basket and money taken from her, in spite of her frantic cries and struggles.</p> 
               <p>At this moment, a policeman, seeing that the rioters were only children, came boldly up to the scene; and Paudeen and the two girls having made their escape with their prize, succeeded in capturing the now sobbing Clara-who, bleeding and bruised, eagerly told her story, and begged the man to go after the robbers, and recover her treasure. To this, the astute guardian of property and peace, replied by taking her roughly by the hand, and marching her in triumph to the station-house.</p> 
               <p>It was now dusk, and every thing at the station-house was in the confusion of preparing for the sending out the police for the night. Nobody seemed to take any particular notice of Clara, who was left sobbing in a corner. At last, they are all gone, and the keeper suddenly remembers that one of the policemen had brought in a little girl, bleeding and crying, and said that she was to be locked up. He looks round,<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7216-00000027"/> fearing that she may have escaped. No-there she is, crying, in the corner, and moaning piteously. He goes up to her, takes hold of her arm, and leading her across the room, opens a door and thrusts her into the cell, with a poor Irish woman,-shutting the door in her face, as the woman makes a spring towards it, crying,</p> 
               <p>"Me babby! me babby!"</p> 
               <p>The Irish woman alternately weeps and raves, and Clara, though it is all dark, and she can see nothing, trembles with fear, and crouches as far away as she can. She is faint and hungry; but she does not think of that-she only lies still and sobs, through the long, long night.</p> 
               <p>Her thoughts wandered between fear, grief, and faintness, and all concentrated into a vague sensation of suffering. Her mother's name occasionally passed her lips; she could not think but that by some miracle the mother who had so loved her would come and take her from the peril, the great unknown peril, in which she was.</p> 
               <p>Then the memory of her mother's last hours came over her; the remembrance of her as when last she saw her passed before her eyes, then she felt as if she were again lying by her cold corse, and each detail of the night she had lain by her side so still and silent, the arms which clasped her getting colder and colder, came before her.</p> 
               <p>Then, too, she remembered the solitary star which had gleamed so brightly through the dark crevices of the wretched roof which sheltered her, and she opened her weary, heavy eyes to see if it were not now above her, but all was dull and dark, for no star ever brightens the utter desolation of a lock-up room in a city station-house.</p>

               <p>THE Mayor at this time was a benevolent, active, middle-aged man, with blue eyes and golden yellow hair, with a stalwart and well made frame, showing clearly his pure Norman descent. Case him in armor and remove those gold spectacles, and you might fancy him one of the knights of the Crusades, who performed their feats of chivalry in the day of Saladin and the Lion Heart.</p> 
               <p>But the age of chivalry had departed, and our benevolent mayor exercised the faculties, which in other days would have been heroism, in trying to reform the many abuses of power and perversions of the law, committed even in the pure and young republic, and in endeavoring to ameliorate the condition of his fellow-creatures. He knows the temptations which beset them, for like all strong and ardent natures, he has passed himself through the fiery furnace of passion, he knows how best to reform, for he has had trials, sorrows and disappointments-but now in the full force of middle age, calm, strong, and serene, living for others, and for all the graver motives of life, he each day prepares conscientiously to fulfill his duties.</p> 
               <p>The officers, so careless and so important in the absence of their chief, lounging about the office, as though each were individually a little mayor himself, and had a right to call the office his own, now assume a most dignified and proper appearance. The wretched prisoners under their charge looked from their dens, stand huddled together in ragged undisguised misery-most of them hardened offenders, habitual drunkards and shameless vagabonds. Sometimes the fair, delicate features of womanhood deprived of her greatest charm, will mingle in this group of degraded faces, the bloom of youth still hiding the corruption of the heart, though the haggard eyes, despoiled of their clear transparency, speak but too plainly of intemperance and debauchery.</p> 
               <p>This morning amidst the group were two beings belonging to neither class. One was a poor Irish woman, whose clumsy form, disordered hair, and irregular features were incapable of inspiring interest, but rock<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7216-00000029"/> ing herself to and fro, this poor woman's deep sobs and streaming eyes could not but make the humane pause.</p> 
               <p>Not far from her, sitting on the floor in a corner, was Clara. Her slender form clothed in soiled and tattered rags, reclined, from very exhaustion, against the wall. Her long matted ringlets fell in heavy masses over her shoulders-the eyes were closed, and the long black lashes shaded her colorless cheek-the incomparable regularity of her features, the delicate olive tinge of her skin, like that of Murillo's virgins, the chiseled mouth revealing the small pearly childish teeth beneath, the arms hanging listlessly by her side, made poor Clara a study for a painter, or for a philosopher, who seeing a being so lovely and of a nature so refined, would sigh to think of her future struggles with a world already so had and ruthless to her earliest years.</p> 
               <p>But there are no artists, and but few philosophers in a court-house, where both could find such feeling subjects for their avocations. The philanthropist alone prowls about the courts of law, seeking not those whom he may aid, but those whom to aid, will bring either money into the pocket or fame before the world. Neither the Irish woman nor the little girl appeared likely to have either money or friends worth conciliating ciliating, so it was the sheriff who rudely roused our friend Judy, for it was she, from her grief and brought her up before the judgment seat of the mayor.</p> 
               <p>Leaving scarcely time for the nature of the complaint to be laid before his honor, Judy began:</p> 
               <p>"Yer honor, upon my soul's salvation, I was not drunk. I have not tasted the dhrink for many months. I was just working away at the wash-tub, and Johnny came home, and he had been drinking, yer honor; and because I had no money to give him, he beat me terrible-and I screamed, and they came and took me away from my babby, that is not weaned, and that'll die widout its mother, yer honor's blessed worship!" and she fell to sobbing and crying again, as if her heart would break.</p> 
               <p>"This woman is not drunk, Mr. Smith," said the mayor, turning to the officer. "I am afraid you have made a mistake here. Go with the woman, and see if you cannot find out the truth. At all events, do not separate her from her child."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, bless yer worship for that!" exclaimed the woman; "but there is a poor little craythur, that they put in to me, last night, and I never knew her till the morning. She cannot spake the English, yer honor, and she is a fatherless and motherless thing that lives wid me, since her poor mother died-and she is gentle<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7216-00000030"/> and innocent as a lamb-I'll go bail wid my life for her."</p> 
               <p>"Where is this girl?" inquired the mayor.</p> 
               <p>Little Clara was brought in. She shook her head, faintly, when the mayor spoke to her, to signify that she did not understand him. She seemed weak, and could hardly stand.</p> 
               <p>"Ho molto fame," at length she said, in a very low voice.</p> 
               <p>His honor knew enough of Italian to understand this phrase.</p> 
               <p>"Why, the child is dying with hunger, I believe," he said; "who arrested her? Oh, was it you, Mr. Thompson? Take her away, and get her something to eat, immediately, and then bring her back." He then spoke to the little girl a few words in Italian, at which her face brightened up immediately, and she went away quietly with the officer.</p> 
               <p>In a few minutes, Mr. Smith returned with Judy, bringing her "babby" in her arms. He said that he had found the husband at home, lying in a corner, drunk, while the baby and several larger children, apparently belonging to the family, were crying for their mother. He had sent for another officer to take off the man, and had found out from the neighbors that the woman was sober and industrious, and was the only support of the family.</p> 
                
               <p>Clara was now brought back, and told her little story to the mayor, in her own language. She said, that she had sold nearly all her matches, and that a beautiful <foreign xml:lang="ITA">angelo,</foreign> with feathers in his hat, and a great diamond buckle in his waist, had given her a piece of white money, as big as that-and then she was so happy, and had got almost home to her mother, (looking up at Mrs. Mullens,)-when some big girls and a naughty boy took her basket away and all her money, and beat her-and then she screamed, and they ran away-and <emph>he</emph> came, (pointing to the policeman,) and took her, where another man put her into a dark room and locked her up-and she didn't know till this morning that it was her "mother," who was there with her, all night, crying.</p> 
               <p>"Do you know who they were that took away your basket?"</p> 
               <p>Clara knew the boy, but she didn't like to tell.</p> 
               <p>But Judy guessed it.</p> 
               <p>"It was Paudeen, wasn't it, darling?"</p> 
               <p>Si," she said, timidly-"Paudeen."</p> 
               <p>The mayor reflected a moment, as if he were not too well pleased with the exploits of his guardians of the public peace. A poor, honest, sober, hard-working washerwoman, arrested because her drunken husband was beating her,-and a little girl carried off in triumph<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7216-00000031"/> umph, because a parcel of blackguards had robbed her-while in both cases, the real offenders escaped with impunity!</p> 
               <p>However, he said nothing. Such things will happen, even in the best regulated police offices! He made Mrs. Mullens tell him all the particulars of the death of Clara's mother, as far as they were known to her; and putting something into the little girl's hand, to buy her some more matches, he promised to call or send some one to see them, in a day or two-and they returned home.</p>

               <p>POOR Judy found her home-which, in its usual disorder, wore an aspect of order of a peculiar kind, in her eyes, perfectly turned upside-down-including the poor "babby," who was lying in the midst of a lake of soap-suds, sleeping in the ruins of the wash-tub, wet, dirty, and exhausted. The other children, those who had the use of their legs, had emigrated to the various rooms of the house-having upset and ransacked every thing-in which amusing operation they were considerably aided by their father, who soon returned, and broke all that came in his way, as though envious of all that stood steadily, whilst he himself reeled so terribly to and fro.</p> 
               <p>Snatching her precious "babby" from the wreck, Judy sat herself on a pile of wet linen, and thrust into<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7216-00000032"/> the mouth of the baby, just opened for a yell, what it had been shrieking for since she had left it-then she began a vociferous recapitulation of all her woes, intermingled with wild kisses to the baby-who, however, did not allow any extraneous object to divert him from his occupation. Now she stormed at Johnny, then she shook her first at an imaginary Paudeen; then she apostrophized her illigant wash, in the midst of which she was seated; then she went back to the mayor's, and soon returned, as we have seen, declaring she was just dying from hunger.</p> 
               <p>"And where's the money the squire gived you, my hinney? for yer just the swate angel thad they gintles takes a fancy to! Go ye to the grocery and git us a few praties, and a herring, and a ounce of tay; and see if ye mate any o' them childers as is strayed, bad luck to 'em, when they upset my illigant wash, and left their poor babby to cry his darlint little life out ov him!"</p> 
               <p>Clara eagerly rose to obey, and was just going out of the door, when it was opened by a strange gentleman.</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Judy Mullens," said he, referring to a paper he held in his hand.</p> 
               <p>"I am that same," said Mrs. Mullens, from the wet pile on which she was enthroned; "come in-for ye are welcome-come in and be seated any where, tho' all the things is nowhere."</p> 
                
               <p>Thus encouraged, the visitor advanced. He was a man of about fifty years of age, with a countenance which would have been commonplace, but for the intense expression of good temper and benevolence which pervaded it. He was somewhat below the middle size, stout and broad-chested. He was dressed with scrupulous care, but without one approach to fashion or dandyism. His hat was smoothly brushed, as was his thin, gray hair; and on his hands were immaculately white cotton gloves. With a smile and an obsequious bow, he advanced into the room, with as much deference as though Judy had been an English duchess, instead of an Irish washerwoman; and pretending not to see any thing he should not see, he addressed his confused hostess, who, unaccustomed to such politeness, was struggling to gather the kicking baby into a state that should make him look less like a cupid, and curtseying and curtseying in the midst of the suds.</p> 
               <p>"Madam," said the visitor, again bowing, "I beg pardon for my hintrusion; but I am come on a herrand, madam, of mercy-which, madam, as the poet says, 'when it season justice'-you know; the rest!"</p> 
               <p>"The rist of the sasoning, sir, does your honor mane? Och! but it's little I've to do with mate, let alone the sasoning."</p> 
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7216-00000033"/> 
               <p>"Excuse me, madam; we will let my little hallusion pass. I am come, then, madam, from his worship the mayor, madam, with whom I believe you are acquainted."</p> 
               <p>"Acquinted! Is that what you call acquinted-to be put in a hole in the dark, and be dragged thro' the strates by a police, like a criminated criminal! Acquinted, is it, and no thanks to ye!"</p> 
               <p>"Then, madam, I will be brief; for I perceive that you are agitated. I am a literary man, madam; I do not say a man of genius, madam-but I am hengaged in a work of deep research, madam-of general hinterest, I may say; and though well versed in the Henglish language, being myself from the old country."</p> 
               <p>"From the ould country, is it ye are!-the blessed Imerald Isle, the gem of the say! Och! yer honor, and I knew it by yer tongue-for ye spake the rale thing, like me, and not like these imperfect Americans, as pretends to talk a tongue as they've no right to, being Americans born, and not English any how."</p> 
               <p>"I ham obliged to you, madam, for the compliment. Though I may say that I speak and write the Henglish language well, madam, as well as most people; I confess that I do not know foreign languages, madam, but most imperfectly; I am told that you have a little adopted daughter, who speaks Italian, I believe; however ever, no matter; any foreign language will do, for my great work is a work of research, requiring translations from both modern and dead languages."</p> 
               <p>"Dead languages! Och, Sir! thin it's just little Clara that knows them-for the language as she spakes is the language of her dead mother. Come here, darling of the world-come here!"</p> 
               <p>Clara drew near; and throwing back her long hair, disheveled by the events of the day, she looked up with her clear eyes at the old man; then she smiled and put her Hand in his-for her instincts had sympathized instantly, with the simple benevolence imprinted on the old man's brow.</p> 
               <p>"Will you go with me, my child? I will take care of you, and bring you to a lady who shall love you as much as this kind lady here."</p> 
               <p>"I like you," replied Clara, with the frankness of her age; "and I'd like to see the lady-but I do not like to go away from the baby."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, you shall come and see the baby, and bring it nice things-that will be better for it, too."</p> 
               <p>"Go along wid ye, Clary, hinny! for ye have little rason for loving any of us; and the gintleman's kind, and ye'll come and see me, and ye'll not forget me, I'm thinking!"</p> 
               <p>Clara threw herself into Judy's arms, and all desire<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7216-00000034"/> for leaving her appeared to have vanished, as she burst into tears.</p> 
               <p>Judy, however, whose substitute for all other endowments was a large allowance of common sense, saw all the advantages of the change, for the child-and perhaps, some after-thought of latent advantages to herself, may have passed through her brain. So, putting down the "babby," with great care-for it was in a profound slumber-she began to put little Clara into as decent a trim as circumstances would allow. Then, kissing her, and hugging her, with one of her most profound curtseys, she pushed her towards her new protector.</p> 
               <p>"Good day, madam," said he, profoundly bowing, as he took the little girl's hand, and prepared to go; "will you allow me to-to"-and the good man hesitated and blushed, as though he were about to take some unpardonable liberty; and then at last timidly placed on the top of the pile of linen, the nearest approach to a table in the room, a shining five dollar piece.</p> 
               <p>In the midst of the wonderment and exclamations of Judy, Clara and her benevolent protector disappeared.</p> 
               <p>They proceeded along many streets, the old man chattering to the little beggar girl, totally unconscious that wondering looks followed him as he passed; at the disparity of their appearance. On they went, up the clean, grim, and formal Arch street, and then diverged still further north, till they came to a small cross street, composed of neat two story brick houses.</p> 
               <p>At one of these Clara and her new friend stopped. The bell having been rung, was answered in a few moments by a young woman.</p> 
               <p>"I knew it was you, dear father," said she, with a smile, and a glance of wonder at the little girl.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Mary dear, I'm come back a little later than usual; but you see I've been detained, and I've brought you such a nice present."</p> 
               <p>"Oh father, dear-"</p> 
               <p>"Don't scold, Mary! Look, I know you will be glad of this present-it's this little girl. Come in, my dear"-and as he spoke he led the way into the parlor.</p> 
               <p>Clara obediently followed, and the lady closing the door, came in with them.</p> 
               <p>She was not a beautiful woman, nor very young, particularly for America, where female youth ends at twenty-five-an age she had evidently reached, if not passed.</p> 
               <p>Mary, as her father had called her, was above the middle height; her figure was admirably proportioned and fully developed; her features were regular, and the expression of her face was one of repose and dignity<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7216-00000035"/> nity-whilst her soft, tender blue eyes had a pensive glance, which interested all who took the trouble of studying her fine countenance, in which strength and delicacy were admirably mingled. Few, however, remarked Mary Edwards, for her manners were retiring and unostentatious, and her dress, both as to material, fashion and color, simple and unpretending.</p> 
               <p>Mary's had been a hard lot; yet she had borne it not only with resignation, but with cheerfulness.</p> 
               <p>Robert Edwards, her father, had once been a highly, respectable and wealthy tradesman in London, but the commercial arcana of the day, consisting of so many webs within webs, had never been within the comprehension of his mind. He had merely invested his capital in what was said to be a profitable concern, and had entrusted the rest to his partner-a young and enterprising man, who had won Mary's affections, and who, with the approval of her father and mother, was to have become her husband.</p>

               <p>ROBERT EDWARDS was the most unsuspicious of beings. Fearful of wounding the feelings of every body, desirous to attain the esteem of all, he never questioned the honesty of any one; and instead of examining into the state of his affairs, or controling his partner, he was grateful to him for taking all responsibility off his hands; and rejoiced at the marriage of his daughter, because it would make their interests so completely mutual, as to render even his nominal surveillance unnecessary.</p> 
               <p>But Robert Edwards' partner was exactly the partner honest and simple-minded men always find-exactly<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7216-00000036"/> the lover such devoted and noble-hearted women ever trust-an intriguing swindler, and a specious, heartless deceiver.</p> 
               <p>His love for Mary was feigned, to lull the suspicions and wariness of Edwards-for he was too deceitful himself to conceive so utterly guileless a nature as that of his partner,-so that the barbarity which destroyed all Mary's future life, was an unnecessary piece of cruelty.</p> 
               <p>Just at the time fixed for the marriage, the catastrophe of this commonplace history occurred. Robert Edwards' partner suddenly disappeared, and Robert Edwards became a bankrupt.</p> 
               <p>The blow, terrible as it was, was not, however, fully comprehended by the merchant. He could not imagine that he, and his wife, and his darling Mary, were about to be reduced to penury. The results of his first interview with his creditors threw him into such a state of despondency, that his wife and daughter grew alarmed for his reason.</p> 
               <p>Then it was, that Mary's strong and devoted nature arose in full power, from her broken heart. She threw aside her own sorrows, her yearnings for the first love of her young life, and interposed herself as a shield between her father and the humiliating and tedious vexations entailed by his failure.</p> 
                
               <p>Although her attention had never been drawn to commercial affairs, her clear mind and extraordinary talents, when applied to them, made her equal to the task she had imposed upon herself. But, spite of all her ability and energy, when, with a rectitude she inherited from her father, all the creditors had been paid, she found that three hundred pounds was all that remained to them.</p> 
               <p>Mary, when she returned from the city with the remnants of the riches she had been told were to be her inheritance, shut herself up in her own room, before she proceeded to seek her father and mother.</p> 
               <p>Throwing off her bonnet and shawl, she sat down at her table; and taking out the money, laid it before her. Then, leaning her head upon her hands, she sat for some time contemplating it, and ruminating in her mind, how she, a woman, was from that sum to create another fortune, or at least to prevent her father and mother from feeling the actual evils of poverty.</p> 
               <p>To leave the house they now were in, was the first step-it was no longer theirs: the very familiar objects around her belonged to others. Where was she to go? What to do? Her mother's health, so delicate, her father, so utterly unfit for counsel-she felt she must decide alone the destiny of all.</p> 
               <p>Now, happy as Mary's life had been, surrounded by<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7216-00000037"/> every comfort, she had seen poverty; she knew what were its miseries, its privations, its degradations. She pictured her father and her mother in their midst, and shuddered. She knew the difficulties besetting female industry in England, and her spirit revolted at the struggle. It seemed to her, that in any land but her own, would her misery be easier to bear; and as she thought, the remembrance of all she had heard of America, recurred to her. A smile illumined her sorrowful face. America, the land of liberty-of liberality-the land where her own language was spoken-the land where she had heard that woman was so worshiped, and where industry and labor were ennobled-where rich and poor had the same privileges, the same advantages. This was the land to which she would take her father. There, no humiliation awaited him; there she could from the slender capital before her, create another fortune-for Mary knew the power of her own intellect, and without being vain of it, she knew that the minds of few women had been cultivated like hers. America, the country of universal education, must be, of all others, the country where cultivation was most appreciated. America, a country whence all false distinctions were banished, must be the country where intellect was most honored.</p> 
               <p>Gathering up the treasure which was to realize these dreams, it was almost with a joyful air that she entered the room where her father and mother were awaiting her. Neither father nor mother ever thought of opposing any project of their darling Mary, whose superiority they were proud to recognize. She had decided they should go to America and from that hour the project appeared to them the only one that could be adopted.</p> 
               <p>Her father, who had been in a state of listless apathy for some time, appeared to be suddenly aroused from it, at the thought of the change of country and of scene. He began immediately to form new projects and schemes of fortune, and eagerly asked Mary to procure for him all the books relative to the new country he was about to adopt.</p> 
               <p>Mary complied, as far as lay in her power; and, thus armed, Robert Edwards proceeded to study the United States, under the various conflicting opinions contained in the volumes before him-whilst Mary proceeded actively with the preparations for their departure.</p> 
               <p>Full of hope, of confidence-feeling as though they were leaving all the evils of poverty, by leaving its humiliations behind, in a country where rank holds so high a place-they sailed towards America, almost with the feeling of a prodigal son returning to an indulgent father.</p> 
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7216-00000038"/> 
               <p>They landed in New York; but they had been warned not to remain in that city of recklessness and luxury. So, guided by Mr. Edwards' researches in the labyrinth of American travels, they proceeded to the Quaker City, where he declared his books said that simplicity, honesty, and brotherly love reigned, as in the earlier days of the formation of the colony.</p> 
               <p>Her first difficulty in Philadelphia, was to find a lodging-a difficulty in which she found no one to sympathize-as there were plenty of boarding-houses in the city, and at all prices. She tried for a week, a quiet, neat-looking boarding-house, where she only paid nine dollars a week for the three. Almost two guineas! she said to herself, as she thought of the neat little cottages in the suburbs of London she could get for a guinea a week, and how well they could all have lived for the remaining one!</p> 
               <p>However, Mary was not to be daunted by first difficulties, which she could so well endure. But her father, who, of course, had no idea of what they paid, or how much money they had, complained, most bitterly, of the room, of the food, of the people, of the servants, of the hours, of the landlady.</p> 
               <p>"Mary, my dear-see to it-wont you?"</p> 
               <p>Poor Mary! If there had been but one thing to get altered! but even her courage quailed before the string of complaints laid before her.</p> 
                
               <p>Her mother, too, accustomed to every comfort, and to delicate food, and to whom rest was so necessary, found the six o'clock breakfast was unattainable-so so she gave it up; Mary being obliged to bring her up a cup of cold, weak tea, with a hunch of bread and a dab of butter, on a cracked plate-eyed all the way by the cold, frigid glance of the landlady, who murmured every day something about "fine English people"-looking on those who got up late, as doers of some peculiar evil, which she could not define, but which struck her as being decidedly wrong, because unlike what every body else did.</p> 
               <p>Although she hated people with voracious appetites, she took it as personal insult when the delicate Mrs. Edwards left the tough beef-steak, or the greasy, hard chicken upon her plate, though she did it most unmurmuringly. Then the boarders thought Mary horribly dowdy in her dress-then they wondered what people meant by living in a boarding-house, and sitting all the evening in their own rooms. Better buy a decent dress than spend so much money in lights! What was the parlor made for? and were they not good enough for a set of pauper cockneys who came to get a living out of them?</p> 
               <p>Then, if Mary did come into the parlor, in order to try and cheer her mother by a little change of scene,<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7216-00000039"/> -the ladies would sit in a circle away from her-look at them over their shoulders, and begin a low, whispering, giggling conversation, evidently aimed at them-looking superciliously at Mary's substantial sewing, and "guessing" whether she was a seamstress-they themselves having a daily warning, each time they put on their fine outer garments, how much their shabby under garments wanted renewing; whilst the contrivances resorted to by husbands as substitutes for buttons, showed that there was no danger of their wives being mistaken for any thing useful.</p> 
               <p>Mary cared neither for sneers nor for solitude, and still less for society; but she perceived that she had mistaken the character of a boarding-house, in imagining it a substitute for family associations, and she began to think, that, her father's books had somewhat misled her as to the feeling of brotherly love prevailing in the Quaker City.</p> 
               <p>Whilst resolving in her mind how to remedy these evils, her mother-her silent, tender, patient mother, spite of all her efforts to keep up, and to spare her child additional sorrow-was obliged to take to her bed. Then began fresh tribulations, which amounted to positive grievances, now as they affected her mother. Impossible, from the sulky, insolent servants, to obtain any help-whatever was necessary for her mother, if sent to the kitchen to be cooked, was returned in so unpalatable a state as to be useless. If Mary went herself into the kitchen, there was neither room on the stove, nor did the lady like her boarders in her kitchen. When her mother lay at the point of death, the gong, with its deafening peal, sounded all the same-the boarders hurried laughing and talking before the door; and the young lady, who was a pupil of Herz's, hammered most inexorably at the eternal variations of "La Violette"-why should she stop? Hadn't she a right to do as she pleased? She wasn't going to stop because an old English woman was dying. Musn't all old people die? Mary, too, affected creature! pretending to be so overcome, and not coming down to the table, indeed! Why, she had lost her mother, and she knew what it was-so nobody was going to impose upon her! No, indeed!-and "no, indeed" was echoed by all the ladies present.</p> 
               <p>What the men might have said, was unknown; for they were all (it being after tea) scattered through various bar-rooms, and billiard-rooms, and bowling-saloons, and none were present, excepting one, who sat in a corner, spinning a penny on a table, to amuse a child he held on his knee. He said nothing; but if he had spoken, he would have been of his wife's opinion-for if he had not, she would probably have<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7216-00000040"/> accused him of having a sly flirtation with the handsome, fair-haired English girl.</p> 
               <p>But all this had to be endured, for her mother was too ill to be moved, and very soon was consigned to the narrow tenement, where none could weary or trouble her, even in this foreign land, which is more foreign to those who speak its language, than to the people of all other nations.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Edwards died, and was buried-the agony common to all, who have loved the dead, was tenfold increased by the petty annoyances, the total absence of sympathy of all around. Mary, however, bore up against all, till her mother was decently laid in the grave. As she stood beside it, she envied her for whom she wept; but the remembrance of her last words came back to her. They had been to recommend her father to her care; and for this holy task, Mary found courage to live.</p> 
               <p>Her first step was to search for a home, where at least her tears might flow without ill-natured comments-where she might minister to her father, and even in poverty, if poverty were to be their lot, alleviate its sharpest pangs, by her own exertions and attentions.</p> 
               <p>In a small street, in the north part of the city, she found what she wished, and expended nearly the last of her slender capital in furnishing it. But for this she cared not-she had a shield between herself and the outward world, where she could gain strength, and recover from the hardships, struggles, and difficulties which surrounded her. Her father, too, was happy-at least, as happy as he could be, after the loss of the gentle companion of his life.</p> 
               <p>He had become very much absorbed in his books, and would shut himself up for hours in the little room called his library, and was perpetually asking Mary for quires of foolscap paper. At last, he one day desired Mary to come into his room; and after mysteriously closing the door, though there was no one in the house, he begged her to sit down, and then, with glistening eye, and blushing cheek, thrust a slender, unblotted, evenly-written manuscript before her.</p> 
               <p>"That's what I've been doing," said he; "it is a great work, Mary-one that will do good to the world now, and when I am dead and gone. It was suggested, I must say, though I do not wish to blame or criticise anybody-far from it-by the books I read about this country before I came to it. You see, I think the authors have made some slight mistakes, not intentional, of course, and so-but read the title."</p> 
               <p>Mary, too astonished to speak, took up the manuscript, and read-</p> 
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7216-00000041"/> 
               <p>"A History of Emigration, from the first Emigration of Adam and Eve out of Paradise, down to the present day. By a European."</p> 
               <p>"Isn't that a taking title?-wont that set the world right, eh? and make our fortunes, too; for of course, the booksellers will jump at it-eh, Mary?"</p> 
               <p>Mary smiled and nodded her head. She was glancing her eyes with wonder at the closely-written pages, as full of faults as they were of words, and puzzling herself as to how she was to dissipate this terrible illusion. Her father imagining her struck with admiration as well as surprise, then proceeded to take from a drawer a bundle of neatly-folded papers, and laid them by her side.</p> 
               <p>They were articles upon various subjects, destined for newspapers; but so trite in their ideas, so badly written-even badly spelled-that to have presented them to an editor would have been ridiculous.</p> 
               <p>"And, Mary, this is not all; see," continued the father to the bewildered girl; "here is some poetry, and-printed-actually printed!"</p> 
               <p>Mary took the highly embellished volume, destined for young and uncultivated minds, and called "Toadey's Baby's Book"-conducted on the principle that every thing that costs nothing must be worth something; and in it she beheld:</p> 
                
               <p>"Lines to my Dead Wife," by Robert Edwards.</p> 
               <p>Poor Mary! She felt the bad poetry to be desecration to the tender sentiments and good feeling of the writer. But she said nothing; for the sight of all these articles had suggested an idea to her, which appeared to present two advantages-that of giving her occupation, and maintaining her father in the belief which made him so happy, that he had a genius for writing.</p> 
               <p>Mary felt she could write, and resolved on humoring her father into the belief that he wrote, while she would perform the task, and be the medium of the articles being published and paid for. She therefore praised her father, encouraged him; and though she met with many rebuffs-though her refined nature shrank from the contact with editorial rooms, often more gross and degrading than that of the stage-she continued to dispose of all she wrote, which her father supposed were his own; and that, added to her needlework during the day, contributed to support them in comfort, if not in luxury. She, however, never told her father how much each article was paid-so that he imagined he was actually realizing a fortune, and spent the money as though he had still a "house in the city," on which he could draw.</p> 
               <p>Often Mary gave him their last dollar-resorting to<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7216-00000042"/> all sorts of subterfuges and contrivances to provide for their household expenses; but she cared not-for the object of her life was to fulfill her mother's injunctions, and make the last years of her father's life happy.</p>

               <p>SUCH was the lady to whom Mr. Edwards had promised to bring Clara, and who had greeted them with so kindly a smile. She, however, was somewhat startled at the sudden addition to their household, and though she strove to speak kindly, their was no effusion in her welcome. However, after she had taken off the ugly, crushed, coal-scuttle straw bonnet, and seen the young Psyche face, beaming with appealing gratitude, she stooped down and imprinted a kiss upon her white, pure forehead.</p> 
               <p>"Isn't that a cheap present?" said the father; "it only cost me five dollars. You know that I was obliged<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7216-00000043"/> to give something to the Irish woman for my pretty present."</p> 
               <p>"Five dollars! Why they were to pay your bill at the stationer's."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, we will pay him to-morrow-it's all the same, you know."</p> 
               <p>Mary sighed-for it was not at all the same. Every day was far from producing five dollars. However, she sighed, and turned away to hide her emotion, but said nothing, as was her wont.</p> 
               <p>"Now this little girl is to read my Italian books, that I want for my great work," continued the father; "my work on emigration, you know. Beccaria is the man's name-a great author, I see from the very look of the print-a great man!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, dear father," said Mary; "but now let us give the little girl something to eat; and when we are better acquainted we shall be better able to see what we can do."</p> 
               <p>Now, although Mr. Edwards had accounted to his daughter for his sudden adoption of our little heroin we have not accounted to the reader for his sudden visit to Judy's forsaken home.</p> 
               <p>In his various pursuits after literature, Mr. Edwards had stumbled on the mayor, who was also a scholar and an author of some repute. He had soon fathomed the calibre of his new acquaintance's mind, and was not long in comprehending his social position, and fathoming how much he stood in need of aid, and how thoroughly he was unconscious of it. He learned too soon to know Mary and her worth, and strove to help her in her filial duties without wounding her pride.</p> 
               <p>To accomplish this he would often give Mr. Edwards some papers to copy, excusing the insignificance of the occupation, under the importance of the matter he had to copy, and the necessity of its being kept secret.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Edwards, instead therefore of being mortified by the unintellectual labor offered him, felt extremely flattered by the confidence reposed in him, and imagined himself invested with the functions of a secretary of state. Scarcely a morning passed but he was to be found in the office watching the proceedings of the court, approving the mayor's decisions by a nod, and imagining his presence extremely necessary to all around.</p> 
               <p>When the sittings were over, the good-natured mayor would usually find time to notice him, and to inquire half-jokingly about the progress of his great work on emigration, a question to which Edwards always replied with the most serious gravity, imagining that he really was destined to leave to posterity a work that should<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7216-00000044"/> insure him, the eternal gratitude of the future generations of both the old and the new world.</p> 
               <p>This work, however, had now arrived at a stage which considerably puzzled its author. He had to consult various works and was just now deep in Beccaria and Cant, whose Della Cruscan Italian were beyond all dictionary aid. Being present on the morning on which Clara was brought before the mayor, and as was his custom, listening most intently to all that went on, he had been struck with this almost providential encounter with a living dictionary, in the person of this hapless orphan, whose appearance and desolation profoundly interested his tender and feeling heart. The mayor too spoke to him as he walked home with him from the office to his house, in order to receive some papers he was to copy, referring to this little hapless orphan with great feeling. This was sufficient for Edwards' still wavering purpose. He determined to give her an asylum under his roof, and thus at once to gratify his feelings of humanity and gain an insight into the mysteries of Beccaria e tutti quanti. Asking the address of the Irish woman from the mayor, he proceeded directly to the house, and so it was that Clara emerged from the sordid misery, and perspective ignorance and wretchedness into which circumstances had thrown her, but to which it was evident, neither her birth nor her natural refinement, had originally intended her.</p> 
               <p>Mary soon loved her father's little protege; and Clara, though she did not forget Judy, felt that the atmosphere she was now in was a far more congenial one, than that in which she had lived since her mother's death.</p> 
               <p>She soon learned to help Mary in the household affairs-to humor and wait on the old man; and Contrived to read, without yawning, pages and pages of Beccaria, in her own soft Italian, much to the satisfaction of Mr. Edwards, who fancied he understood it, because he heard it read. Poor Clara, however, was evidently not of a literary turn; for she never could be made to translate one sentence of the erudite Italian into English, though she now had learned to speak that language perfectly.</p> 
               <p>Mary, however, always found some ready excuse for her, and went on giving her the elements of a sound, plain education. Clara, however, did not care for books-though she would sometimes find a piece of poetry, over which she would ponder whole hours, until at last she knew it by heart; then she would run to Mr. Edwards' room, and, standing before him, repeat it with dramatic emphasis and gesture, to suit the sentiment, to the great delight of her audience.</p> 
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7216-00000045"/> 
               <p>Accomplishments, of course, Mary could not, had she willed it, bestow on her protege; but art seemed to be instinctive in the young girl's mind-a picture, or an engraving, in a shop window, would arrest her instantly; and she would, when unwillingly dragged away by Mr. Edwards, (poor Mary had very little time for going out,) continue to talk of the picture-to compose a story to it-to conjecture as; to what preceded and what followed the scene depicted. Then, though she was totally ignorant of music, her ear caught up every tune which the organs in the street ground past her door-converting them into magnificent cavatinas, or varying them into capricious corrus-cations, with a voice of such full and deep melody, that often people as they passed the little, quiet house in Tower street, would stop and listen in admiration.</p> 
               <p>In all needlework-at least that of an artistic character, where the needle does the work of an artist's pencil-she excelled. Her temper was serene, cheerful-sometimes wildly gay. She was subject to fits of despondency, however, and then she would sit in the twilight at Mary's feet, and, laying her head on her knees, would talk to her of her dead mother-of her last words-and of her early recollections-which, as her mind and intellect developed, appeared to become more vivid. She remembered distinctly, she thought, her father; she loved his memory, and cherished it, perhaps because she imagined him still to be alive, and clung to it as to something belonging to her-perhaps, because her mother's spirit, watching over her, inspired these dreams, which one day might lead the orphan to the father. However it might have been, Clara made this image of her father, evoked from the memory of the heart, the idol of her life. She would look at the silver ring for hours together-dwell on the initials G. and A.-adding to it every day some fresh name, by which to call this hero of her dreams. Mary loved this child almost with a mother's love; she admired her fine artistic powers, her bright intelligence, her sensitive nature, her passionate and imaginative heart. Some years earlier in life, before she had known the hard struggle of the world, she would have developed these powers and faculties to the utmost; but now, she strove to suppress them, and sighed often as she found how vain were her efforts to bring this young, unconscious child of genius down to the level of mediocrity.</p> 
               <p>They lived almost entirely alone, so that Clara had no opportunities of hearing from others what Mary did not tell her. She knew not that her nature was refined and poetical; she knew not that she was beautiful as a nymph. Her powers of imagination, her vivacity, made each monotonous day bring some variety<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7216-00000046"/> riety; her intensely loving nature made her delight in her dependence on her two benefactors; nor did she look, as yet, beyond the walls of her tiny home for further happiness.</p> 
               <p>The world had not prospered with the two emigrants, neither had any great reverses befallen them. Mary's articles had been often quoted and copied in various papers, and some few editors, in want of a paragraph, had alluded to the author and the piquant style; but that was all. Mary belonged to no clique-Mary had no friends, and possessed not the art of flattery. To go into an office, where the editor in his shirt sleeves, cigar in mouth, his dirty boots on his desk, received her without even a nod of recognition, holding out his hand for the article, and after measuring it with a string, or counting the words and lines, would shout out into the next office,</p> 
               <p>"Here, Scraggs! Pay two dollars;" or three, or four, as the case might be: this was as much as Mary found courage for. To have spoken to this man, who, with European reminiscences, she felt was almost insulting her, (though he would have been shocked if he had thought she had such an idea,) was what she could never have done. As to trying to make acquaintance with him, or to interest him, that was more than she could have done, even for her father's sake; and as for asking for more pay-why, she would rather have endured any privation; for none could have been so hard, or so difficult, as that of haggling or begging for money, for the work of her own brains, and her own hands. So, Mary's articles made their mark; but they benefitted the editor, and the paper in which they appeared, and not Mary, which, in a measure, was somewhat her own fault. But so it was; and as Mary is not actually our heroine, she may be allowed to have faults.</p> 
               <p>The Edwardses, then, remained in the same position; only, as Clara grew up, the difficulties increased, because it was more difficult to support three than two.</p> 
               <p>Clara had often surprised Mary writing, far on in the night, and seen her working, hour after hour. She knew that Mary lived by her own labors; but her young mind had never pondered upon the difference her presence made in the economy of the household, though she felt an instinctive desire for occupation. But it was something soaring, grand-she wanted something she could not define, even to herself; Mary, even, did not know what she wanted, for even she declared, when appealed to, she could not interpret such wild flights of impracticability.</p> 
               <p>But Mary knew well the aspirations of this high<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7216-00000047"/> artistic nature, and knew that the drama, the stage, music and song, were created for it; that Clara's spirit was not destined to walk the earth, but to soar above its sordid passions, with the bright wings of genius. But the wounded heart, chained down to the struggles of commonplace, strove to keep the young heart in blissful oblivion.</p> 
               <p>Still, the spirit of independence, which had led Clara to become a match-girl, now led her to seek for other employment. She feared to speak to Mary about it, lest she should fancy her discontented or ungrateful; but, at length, waking one night, and seeing poor, weary Mary still toiling at her writing-table, the young girl leaped from her bed, and throwing herself at her feet, burst into a passionate fit of weeping, exclaiming:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Mary, Mary, let me help you! let me work too!"</p> 
               <p>And so, the first word having been spoken, Mary, whose own good sense told her, spite of her own heart, that she had no right to prevent Clara from providing for herself, seeing that, besides her protection, she had none to depend on but herself, consented to seek some occupation for the young girl.</p> 
               <p>She revolted from sewing, not feeling the courage to confine the young spirit in the dense atmosphere of a work-room; and so, thinking over the various professions in which women are employed, she remembered to have heard that the newspapers and bookbinders employed many, and that they were well paid.</p> 
               <p>The editor of the <title>Daily Universe</title> was, of all for whom she wrote, the one who treated her with the nearest approach to deference; to him, therefore, she resorted for information, trusting that he might be able to understand the nature of the occupation she sought, and help her in finding something that should occupy, without degrading the purity of the tender child she was about to cast into the battle-field of life.</p>

               <p>ONE morning Mary, turning the corner of Third street, and pushing her way through a crowd of brokers, idlers, sub-editors, reporters, scribblers, and news-boys, which obstructed the "Ledger corner," entered a tall, imposing stone building. Its dark brown front, with its dignified architecture, appeared as though originally destined to be the abode of some retired Aristocrat; but scarcely was the threshold passed, before the numerous signs, in white paint, on the doorposts-the dirty vestibule-the trellis iron-work staircase, with each step appropriated to some inmate of the many-passaged monster, and marked by his name-indicated that this was a palace of industry, and not of idleness.</p> 
                
               <p>Mary climbed the steep stairs, and opening a heavy iron spring door, she found herself in the presence of about a dozen men, begrimed and unshaven, (it was towards the last days of the week,) with shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbow. A few of these men diffused from either pipes or cigars; the earth around them with disgusting little pools of saliva and tobacco, making Mary pick her way, as along the dirtiest streets, and lift her grey merino dress with scrupulous care.</p> 
               <p>Making, her way through smoke, tobacco, and the broad stare and loud laughter of the men-for, notwithstanding the proverbial respect of American men to the other sex, a woman never meets with either courtesy, deference, or respect, if she belong to the class forced to earn her living. A coarse joke, a familiar gesture, greets the folding-girl, or fly-girl, supposed from her position to authorize such a demeanor; while the unfortunate woman whose intellect affords her support, and whose manner, conduct, and breeding, forbid all familiarity, the men she is forced to come in contact with delight in humbling and embarrassing, by every act of rudeness in their power; from the editor, who keeps her standing, answers her last of all, and pays her less than everybody, to the printer's devil, who refuses to go to her house for copy; the foreman<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7216-00000049"/> who scorns a woman's manuscript, and who, together with his aids, to revenge themselves for the reserve of her manners, take every means in their power to make her feel her dependent position.</p> 
               <p>Mary, like most women in her position, would rather have written an extra column for nothing, than have to go through the ordeal of an office, and the humiliating circumstances which attended it; but as this humiliation could not be spared her, she had forced herself to submit to it, and had now become almost insensible to what had before so much affected her. She could even listen, Without feeling mortified, to the discussion carried on, in a loud voice, between the two editors, as to the worth of her articles; and submit, without laughing, to see the bright emanations of her brain measured with a piece of string, like so much tape or calico. Habitual contributors to newspapers are paid by measurement-not by merit. The most magnificent philosophical, metaphysical, or political disquisition, clothed and expressed in the most eloquent English ever written, is of no more value than if it were the veriest amount of commonplace. It is half a column, as the string tells you; and so is the long puff upon somebody's carpets, or somebody's bitters; and, in the estimation of the editor, were it as well written as Carlyle-were it full of new ideas and fresh discoveries, it would never be, in most editors' estimation, any thing but half a column, according to string; nor would it be paid any more for being well written, than if it were written badly; nor would it be inserted, or paid for at all, as long as there was the most insignificant puff to take up the space: because, the puff, gentle reader, is paid for by the advertiser, and the editor had rather "put money in his purse," than ideas into your brains.</p> 
               <p>Mary, however, had, as we say, got over all sensitiveness; so she wended her way through the printing office into the editor's sanctum, where she knew, at this hour, she should find the editor of the <title>Daily Universe.</title>
               </p> 
               <p>She opened the door, and there he was in his office, as he called it, or the den, as it ought properly to be called, in which he passed the greater portion of his life, surrounded, as he now was, by piles of newspapers, paste-pots, and proofs.</p> 
               <p>Harry Rushton, who was sitting in his shirt sleeves, with his hat on, rapidly writing, on long strips of paper, and actually laughing as he wrote, at his own fun (for he was alone) and wit, did not, accustomed as he was to the opening and shutting of the office door, look up as Mary entered; nor was it until she got close up to his desk, and stood opposite to him, that<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7216-00000050"/> he raised his bright and smiling face from the paper, and fixed his brilliant, sparkling eyes upon her.</p> 
               <p>Instantly he arose, dashed off his hat, and pushing down a whole file of newspapers in confusion on the floor, offered her a seat, saluting her with a courteous and cheerful</p> 
               <p>"Good morning!"</p> 
               <p>"I am interrupting you, I know," said she; "but I can only find you in your office, and you are only here when occupied."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, never mind!" replied Rushton; "I have always time enough, you know, because I can write a little faster, if I spend some time in talking to you. Now, Miss Edwards, what have you got to propose to us? Some new and bright idea, I have no doubt. Your last articles were capital-everybody has been asking who wrote them."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed? But I am not come to talk about literature, Mr. Rushton; I want you to give me a new idea, for I myself am greatly puzzled, and the article which puzzles me, is a young girl of sixteen."</p> 
               <p>"Mighty puzzling things, I'm told," said Rushton; "is she pretty?"</p> 
               <p>"That is a man's first question," replied Mary, laughing; "but as it is nothing to the purpose, I shall decline answering. The young girl I speak about, is one whom I have brought up, and for whom I now want you to find an employment-I do not mean in your office, but to find, amongst the various manual occupations connected with books and newspapers, one that shall suit my proteg."</p> 
               <p>"Is she intelligent?"</p> 
               <p>"That question I can answer; she is more than intelligent-and it is to turn that intelligence into a useful channel, that I desire to find an employment for her. Brought up in seclusion, imbibing more learning and education than befits her lot in life, this girl is unfortunately cursed with imagination and genius. In former years I should have cultivated it-now I try to crush it, and to make her a commonplace woman, with no other aspirations than-"</p> 
               <p>"'To suckle fools and chronicle small beer,' I suppose, Miss Edwards," said Rushton, laughing; "well, I suppose you are right-I don't think there is much room here, in our rude, every-day life, for a woman of genius. The <emph>men,</emph> Who Can't be bound down to dollars and cents, have trouble enough to get on, as it is. Let me see-what can we find to do for a plain little girl endowed with genius?"</p> 
               <p>"I did not say she was plain," said Mary, smiling at the word, as Clara's rare and incomparable beauty rose before her; "however, proceed."</p> 
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7216-00000051"/> 
               <p>"Well, I suppose you hate declined the various avocations of the needle-woman-and you are right. Suppose you make her a fly-girl?"</p> 
               <p>"A fly-girl!" exclaimed Mary, somewhat startled at the extraordinary trade proposed for Clara, and without the most distant idea of what it could be.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Harry, who having been in a printing office all his life, and set type almost before he could read, could not understand Mary's astonishment; "yes, let her be a fly-girl; she will make two dollars and a half a week, and we can give her an occupation in this office."</p> 
               <p>"That would be desirable, certainly-but a fly-girl-what can you mean by a fly-girl, Mr. Rushton?"</p> 
               <p>"Ah, ah! Miss Edwards, do you really not know? Well-girls are not required to have wings to be fly-girls-a fly-girl means a girl who receives the printed sheets as they come from the press, and lays them straight-no very difficult work, I imagine, for I always hear the girls laughing, and see them look fat, healthy, and pretty-those who <emph>are</emph> pretty, you know, Miss Edwards-eh?"</p> 
               <p>"Of course. So then, you will take Clara, will you?"</p> 
               <p>"Clara? Certainly, Miss Edwards; I'll put her name down here on my book. What's her other name?"</p> 
                
               <p>"You may put her down as Clara Edwards, if you like, for we have never known her name-she is an orphan-so we called her, ourselves, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">Clara Perdita,</foreign> from the resemblance of her fate and character to Shakspeare's heroine, and also from her being Italian."</p> 
               <p>"Italian!" exclaimed Rushton, turning his quick glance upon Miss Edwards; "Italian, is she? I declare, an Italian fly-girl!-that's quite romantic!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, but she speaks English; therefore you need not tell any one she is Italian. I particularly wish not to cultivate the romantic. So put her down as Clara Edwards, and on Monday next she shall be here."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, let her go to the press-room, and the foreman and the girls will soon show her what she has to do."</p> 
               <p>Mary took her leave, and hastened to return to her quiet, little home in Tower street, where she imparted the joyful news to Clara, that in a few days she would be actually in possession of a situation bringing in two dollars and a half a week.</p> 
               <p>Clara embraced Mary, danced round Mr. Edwards and the volumes of old Beccaria, sure that her road to fortune was now secure, and then laughing at the singular title about to be bestowed upon her, and translating it into Italian, "Sono la figlia che vola, Vola, vola,"<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7216-00000052"/> set it to such intricate variations that the most expert stenographer of music, if such there be, would have been puzzled to note down the wheel within wheel, of her bird-like warblings.</p> 
               <p>Harry Rushton, when Mary had left him, turned round immediately to finish the article her entrance had interrupted; but to his astonishment neither words nor ideas, were, as usual, to be found beneath his rapid pen. The image of the Italian girl who resembled Shakspeare's Perdita had struck on his imagination; the imagination of a poet; for, clever as Harry Rushton was as an editor, nature had intended him for a poet and endowed him with all the rich and fatal gifts of poesy. But the working every-day world, in which, from earliest infancy, Harry had been forced to live, gaining his own livelihood, had driven the muse into the recesses of his own heart and brain, where he trusted time would destroy her, and the love of the world at length, entomb her forever.</p> 
               <p>Vain however were Harry Rushton's efforts; genius, imagination, fancy, would not be banished from this their spoiled and wayward child, whose character they had swayed and formed. All the prose of his real life, could not kill the poetry of the imaginary life of his dreams and his aspirations. Harry was a strange composition. Disbelieving all dogma-belonging to no religious creed, he had formed a fanciful heaven of his own and believed in a spiritual existence far above this sphere of toil and trouble; he had no faith in men, yet was perpetually their dupe-as to women, he had always found them so inferior to his ideal, so incapable of comprehending him, so trivial and so cold, that he set them aside as a portion of creation with which he had nothing to do. Impulsive, tender, warm-hearted and devoted, he had never known the love of a mother or a sister; his father had died when he was a boy. He was a self-educated and a self-made man; none had directed his desultory studies; none had restrained his ardent and impetuous character; none had given him strength, firmness, self-control; so was he left to possess all the most dangerous and brilliant gifts, without a guiding power to steer him safely into the right path.</p> 
               <p>Harry went through life like a locomotive, set in motion by the giant power of the modern world, without an engineer to direct its way. It might proceed along the track laid down for it, or it might rush wildly through village and valley, scattering destruction and dismay as it passed, till finally, it fell headlong from some precipice, dashed into atoms by its own impetuosity.</p> 
               <p>Such might be the fate of Harry Rushton; but at<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7216-00000053"/> present he was the plodding, working editor of a popular daily paper, belonging to Messrs. A. and B. These worthy citizens, highly respectable, and passing rich, had bought the Daily Universe as a good speculation, exactly as they would have bought a ship load of cotton, or a cargo of dry goods, had they considered it a better speculation. They had engaged Harry Rushton as the working editor at so much a week, and esteemed his talents, just as much as they would the talents of the clerk they would have engaged to measure out their dry goods, if they had bought dry goods instead of a newspaper.</p> 
               <p>Harry accepted cheerfully his position. Finding all the world so different from himself, he imagined the world was right and he was wrong; so he submitted to all the sordid business habits of his employers, thinking it all right; reserving his artistic and refined tastes, his poetical imaginings and his fanciful theories, for his own enjoyment, he plodded away at paragraphs and politics till the Daily Universe actually reached 00000 thousands of circulation, and his salary was increased-five dollars a week.</p> 
               <p>Harry, as he stands now with his pen ready to write a squib, and his brain ready to indite a poem, was himself worthy of becoming a study for a painter. His head so well shaped, so admirably set on his well-formed formed throat, which rose so harmoniously from the shoulders, his jet black hair, which waved, but did not curl, and which, though ever in disorder, appeared always to fall in a fashion best calculated to set off the picturesque character of the whole face; his features were regular; the mouth, just shaded by the moustache jet black like the hair, indicated endurance and energy, if not firmness and power. But the charm of this poetic face lay after all in the deep brown eyes, so dazzlingly bright that showers of stars seemed to fall from them as they sparkled; then suddenly, as the thoughts of the poet's ever-varying mind, changed to some mournful mood, they melted into tenderness and melancholy, transforming the bright and joyous countenance into a face full of foreboding, regret and despondency. His figure was slight, and if Harry had a weakness, if he ever prided himself about any thing, it was about the smallness and delicacy of his exquisite foot, and his hand, white, round, and soft, as a woman's.</p> 
               <p>Such was Harry Rushton.</p> 
               <p>"Copy," cried a messenger from the printing office.</p> 
               <p>"Here you are," said Harry, for never was such a demand made to Harry without the "copy" being on hand.</p> 
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7216-00000054"/> 
               <p>Then, left to himself, the plodding drudge took a large sheet of paper, and before he wrote anymore "copy," he indulged himself in an invocation to the Clara Perdita, whom his imagination revived from the realms of fancy; Perdita, whom another poet had made immortal.</p> 
               <p>Having satisfied himself on this point, he thrust his poetry into his pocket, and proceeded to prove to the readers of the Daily Universe, that this was a utilitarian age, and that all that tended not to actual practical good, should be put down by all good people, and decidedly discountenanced by all respectable people; a class for whom Harry had the highest veneration, because it was so difficult to define, and because from his experience of the various and contending elements which went to make it, he felt he never, never, could hope to attain to that enviable distinction, of being called a respectable man.</p>

               <p>IT was a much harder trial to Mary Edwards to launch her bright, beautiful and gifted proteg into the every-day life of a fly-girl (how harshly the words grated on Mary's ear!) than it was to Clara to take possession of her post in the press-room, and her place in the midst of the "girls," who like her were fly-girls.</p> 
               <p>Clara, most immaculately innocent, who had never since she had been under the charge of the old Englishman and his daughter, heard one word which could send her young imagination into an impure train of thought; Clara, who had never blushed but with pleasure; Clara<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7216-00000055"/> utterly ignorant of the world and its vices, was not in the least timid. She dreaded nothing, she feared no one, she had never felt either envy or vanity, and animated by the thought that she was about to aid those who had saved her and protected her, she entered the press-room with a bounding heart and a beaming eye.</p> 
               <p>When she saw all the young girls assembled, she smiled with pleasure, for she had never had companions of her own age, and thinking all girls like herself, she was prepared to find sisters in them all.</p> 
               <p>As for Mary, she wiped a tear from her eye, as she consigned Clara to the care of the rough, careless foreman, and all the way home she closely examined her motives, to ascertain whether the path she had chosen for Clara was a right one, in order fully to satisfy her conscience. After all, her heart revolted at a career which, from the refined nature of the young girl, and her extraordinary talents, appeared, spite of penury and helplessness, to be a degradation.</p> 
               <p>Clara having bid Mary good-by, followed the foreman into the press-room, where, not only the "Hoe's patent revolver," upon which the Daily Universe turned round on its axis, but four or five other presses, engaged in all sorts of job work, were kept constantly going; the flying, or receiving the printed sheets being all done by girls.</p> 
                
               <p>These girls, recruited from all classes of that class called the working classes, had, most of them, spite of an average amount of good looks, a bold carriage and manner, which did not impress favorably as to their moral character.</p> 
               <p>Without wishing to discourage the efforts of the female philanthropists of the day, to get women into numerous avocations now belonging exclusively to men, there is a fact worthy of notice, which is, that of all the classes of "girls," gaining their own livelihood, the sewing girl is the most virtuous in conduct, and the most modest in demeanor. All girls employed in trades, which bring them in constant contact with men of their own class-those employed in printing offices, bookbinderies, in coloring plates, or in polishing metals, are loud in speech, bold in carriage, and careless in conduct.</p> 
               <p>The foreman never looked at Clara, but led her up to the press where she was to be employed. The girls, however, as she came forward, all looked up from their work to scan the stranger.</p> 
               <p>With the quick eye of woman and envy, they discovered, at a glance, the surpassing beauty of their new companion, her exceeding grace, and the innocent expression of her countenance; consequently she was received by them with a toss of the head, a supercilious<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7216-00000056"/> cilious stare, and a determination, adopted almost simultaneously by all, to treat this new-comer with as much disdain, and ill-nature, as possible.</p> 
               <p>"Here, Miss Poole," said the foreman, "here's a new hand; just you show her what she's got to do."</p> 
               <p>"I guess," said Miss Poole, with a toss of the head, "that she can find out if she's any sense; if she hasn't, she had better not come here at all."</p> 
               <p>"Guess she might find out that she's got to take her bonnet off," observed Miss Esther Jenkins, one of the girls whose beauty had obtained for her powerful protectors, and who was looked up to with deference and envy by the others, from the grand bonnets, shawls, and silk dresses, she was able to display.</p> 
               <p>Clara, incapable of comprehending ill-nature, or superciliousness, turned towards Miss Esther Jenkins, with a bright beaming smile, and hastening to untie the strings of her plain straw bonnet, exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"I think I might have found that out; how very stupid I am!"</p> 
               <p>The girls took this speech in quite a different sense to what it was intended; and imagining Clara had retorted on Esther, burst into a loud laugh at her expense; while Miss Poole, turning towards Clara, said, in a condescending tone:</p> 
               <p>"Yes, take off your bonnet and shawl, and hang them up here, and then come and stand by me."</p> 
                
               <p>Clara obeyed with alacrity; and having taken <emph>off her things,</emph> as the girls technically called her disrobing, she stood before Miss Poole, in all the loveliness of youth and innocence.</p> 
               <p>Her form, slight, yet round, had all the characteristics of her country; the full bust, the falling shoulder, the graceful undulation, resulting from strength and harmonious proportions. The face was one in which the features, and the deep starry eyes, not bright like the stars in heaven, but soft and liquid as the reflection of those stars, seen in the blue waters of Italy's calm lakes-were capable of expressing every varied passion. The pure white forehead, with its dark pencilled brow, was full of latent intellect and thought; but neither passion nor genius had yet been aroused; all still slumbered; the world and its struggles had not called it forth. With her dark brown hair, wound simply round her classical head in masses of thick braids, Clara, as she now stood, gazing up towards Miss Poole with a wondering expression in her eye, and a smile just parting her full, red lips, looked like a young Psyche, before the god had chosen her, from all mortals, for his love.</p> 
               <p>If the first sight of Clara's beauty had disposed the girls to ill-nature, the guileless expression of her look, the confiding childishness of her manner, totally<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7216-00000057"/> changed this disposition towards her. These girls were not degraded as yet from all womanhood, and they were most of them young. Their instincts were pure, as are all women's instincts, till the world corrupts them, their fellow-women scorn them, and men, cringing to wives and respectability, treat them with insult and contempt.</p> 
               <p>If their lives, in the avocations of their trade, led them to boldness and corruption, the way in which their scanty wages obliged them to live in the hours destined to be spent at what was called <emph>home,</emph> was not calculated to inspire ideas of refinement, or purity.</p> 
               <p>These girls boarded together, in a house near the Schuylkill, where they all occupied one large room, and slept, dressed, and performed such few ablutions, as their hands and faces were familiar with, in common. They paid for these accommodations a dollar and a half per week, each; taking breakfast and tea at home, and bringing their dinners with them, in little tin pails. From twelve to one o'clock, every day, the clang of the engines was hushed; and the "fly-girls," seated on immense heaps of "wet-down" paper, either white, or only printed on one side, and packed between large heavy "boards," which served admirably for both table and seat, opened their tin pails, and their ruddy mouths, and set tongue and teeth going at a rate that shamed the rattle of the steam-engine itself, which stood looking on in wonder and silence; every now and then, when the noise and laughter became too uproarious, giving out a tremendous "sh!" through its iron teeth, to which the merry fly-girls, however, paid not the slightest attention.</p> 
               <p>Then, as soon as the clock struck one, away went gossip, laughter, and tin pail; the grim old engine resumed his labors with a snort; round went the busy, silent type, that were to speak to-morrow to so many thousands, in cottage, store, and drawing-room; and the merry female gnomes of this unseen world again grouped themselves to their task.</p> 
               <p>Miss Poole, as we have said, felt her heart mollified as her hard, bold blue eye, met Clara's confiding, childlike gaze; and, taking her by the arm, she led her up towards one of the presses.</p> 
               <p>"Come," said she, "stand by me, and you will soon learn; it's easy enough, though it's precious hard work, I can tell you. What's your name?"</p> 
               <p>"Clara," responded our heroine.</p> 
               <p>"Clara," repeated the girls in chorus. "My, that's a pretty name, ain't it?"</p> 
               <p>"I shouldn't wonder if she hadn't got another," said Esther Jenkins, with a toss of the head.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, I have two others," said Clara, as before,<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7216-00000058"/> perfectly unconscious of the taunt intended to be conveyed, "Perdita Edwards."</p> 
               <p>"La, my! Edwards <emph>what?</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>"Perdita," repeated Clara, with the purest Italian accentuation. "I am called Perdita, because I am a lost child."</p> 
               <p>"A lost child; only to think," said one of the girls. "You haven't got any father or mother?"</p> 
               <p>"No," said Clara, in a low tone, the tears gathering in her eyes; "my mother is dead, and-"</p> 
               <p>"I wish you would mind your work, all of you;" shouted Miss Poole, who was set in authority over the fly-girls. "I guess she ain't sent here to be catechized by you, any how."</p> 
               <p>And so Clara was introduced into the working world; and so she made her acquaintance with the greatest enemies a woman has to encounter in her battle with life, namely, her own sex.</p> 
               <p>In the hours of repose, there were many things said by the girls which Clara did not understand; and often the innocence of Clara's observations, the unsophisticated manner in which she replied to all questions, was a source of great amusement to her companions. They soon discovered that they had no rivalry to dread from Clara, and that, spite of her great beauty, she was incapable of ever "standing in their way;" her cheerfulness, her good nature, won their hearts, and, in a few weeks, Clara became the proteg of all, and the universal favorite of the pressroom.</p> 
               <p>Esther Jenkins, by some caprice, which as a pretty woman she was fully entitled to indulge in, after the few first days, took an especial fancy to Clara, and strove to draw her into intimacy; but it was a difficult matter, for Mary, still impressed with her European prejudices, could not bear to trust one so young and beautiful alone in the streets, brought her every morning to the printing office, fetching her also in the evening.</p> 
               <p>By dint of custom the girls were perfectly insensible to the noise of the engine; and one of their favorite amusements was to sing the popular melodies of the day, either in chorus or alone, if there chanced to be among their number one, whom they called u a good singer;" that is, who in a shrill, throaty voice, could set some popular words, to <emph>almost</emph> the tune for which they were written.</p> 
               <p>There was at this time a song going the rounds of all the cheap concerts, and played by all the organs in the streets, which had been taken from one of the Italian operas, simplified and set to English words of a popular nature.</p> 
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7216-00000059"/> 
               <p>Clara's quick ear caught it up instantly-her memory so apt and retentive to rhyme, had as quickly retained the words. One day, after a learned disquisition by the young lady critics, on the merits of this song, the one, deemed <emph>the singer</emph> of the establishment, tried to give them a specimen of the tune. Vain, however, were her efforts; she could not get beyond the few first bars, though, as she said, she had <emph>got it in her head.</emph> Clara, whose very nature was music, looked up from her work, and nodding her head in token of silence, took it up in her deep, rich, melodious Italian voice, so vibrating, so true, so fresh, so full of expression, and, to the astonishment and delight of the whole assembly, sang the melody all through.</p> 
               <p>No favorite prima donna was ever greeted with such truthful and heartfelt applause. From that day Clara was installed as the singer of the establishment. None of the girls were jealous of this accomplishment; but, on the contrary, it became a matter of pride amongst them to laud Clara's talents, and to boast to the girls of other printing offices, that the press-room of the Daily Universe possessed the finest singer in the city.</p> 
               <p>Clara delighted to please her companions; Clara, who at any time would rather sing than talk, she, to whom music was a natural language, was never tired of singing, and sang the livelong day: first, all the English songs she knew, with her own fanciful variations; then, the few old Italian songs and barcaroles she had heard in her infancy, and which she remembered still so perfectly, though she sought in vain to recall to her memory where she had learned them, and who had taught them to her. Still, ever as she sang them, the melody would bring, as with intuitive association, the vision of a calm blue sea, the undulation of a boat, high palaces with overhanging balconies, and tender, soft, dark eyes, she fondly loved to think her father's, looking at her.</p> 
               <p>The printers even, would steal into the press-room to listen to the "foreign fly-girl," as they had nicknamed Clara; in fact, Clara met with unbounded success amongst the most appreciative of publics-the musicians of nature's forming.</p> 
               <p>Now it happened, that one day Mr. Harry Rushton went up into the printing office in a towering passion. He was the most inexorable of proof-readers, and the most exact of printers. In the columns of the Daily Universe he had that day found two absurd and egregious errors, (he remembered to have corrected,) which spoiled two of Mr. Harry Rushton's best jokes, in two of his most spicy paragraphs.</p> 
               <p>"I shall have to set the paper up myself, as well as write it," said he. "Printers are, I do verily believe,<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7216-00000060"/> the most dander-headed-where's the foreman?" added he, furious at not having any one with whom to be furious; and going instinctively up to the case, he set up the maimed sentence, as it ought to have been, just for his own private satisfaction, for it was, alas, too late for it ever now to benefit the Daily Universe. "Where's Mr. Russell?"</p> 
               <p>"In the press-room."</p> 
               <p>"Go and fetch him, Tom; I'll have him discharged, I swear I will."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Tom, laughing; and sauntering towards the press-room, he murmured to himself-"guess you're just the man to get a fellow discharged, when you're giving all your own salary to the first on us, as asks for it."</p> 
               <p>Tom went on his errand, executing it with expeditious slowness, in order to give the editor's passion time to evaporate, and left open the door leading to the passage, which separated the press-room from the printing office.</p> 
               <p>It so happened, that at that very moment Clara was singing one of her old Italian songs, and was embellishing, with a few final roulades, the last verse of the quaint old air- <q>
                     <l>"La Note xe bella."</l>
                  </q>
                   And, truth to tell, Mr. Russell, the offending foreman, was in the press-room for no other earthly purpose, than to listen to the "foreign fly-girl."</p> 
               <p>Harry Rushton paused, as the deep melodious tones were borne to his ear; he raised his eyes, still sparkling with anger, and listened, till all the tenderness of the song worked on his susceptible nature, and beamed in his softened glance. Then, throwing down the type, (they fell from his practiced hand instinctively into their right boxes,) he followed the sounds, which led him to where Tom and the foreman were standing entranced, till he himself stood before Clara.</p> 
               <p>Putting his finger on his lips, he signed to all not to notice his presence, and there he stood still, gazing and listening, till his soul was filled with beauty. Harry Rushton was an artist, beauty was his idol, music one of his fondest passions, and this creature before him, appealed to all his senses at once.</p> 
               <p>Clara, her eyes fixed on her papers, was utterly unconscious of the little scene enacting before her, she warbled freely and wildly, till coming to the last deep note with which the song ends, she raised her eyes, and they encountered the admiring, passionate gaze of Harry Rushton. Then suddenly her eyes fell, her hand trembled, and, for the first time beneath the glance of man, she blushed.</p> 
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7216-00000061"/> 
               <p>As for Harry, as soon as the song was concluded, he turned abruptly round, and forgetting foreman, printing office, and proofs, he rushed to the den sacred to himself, and taking out a well-worn Shakspeare from one of the pigeon holes of his desk, he turned to "Winter's Tale," and read the whole of the episode of "Perdita." When he had concluded, he took from a drawer a sheet of paper on which were some verses. These he read carefully, then shaking his head, he deliberately tore it into pieces, and scattered the fragments around.</p> 
               <p>Then, with a sigh restoring Shakspeare to its abiding place, he murmured, with a deep-drawn sigh:</p> 
               <p>"Neither I nor Shakspeare had ever seen Clara."</p>

               <p>CLARA, when Harry Rushton was gone, felt that the blush his glance had called up still lingered on her brow, and she did not dare to raise her eyes.</p> 
               <p>An undefined fear and shame came over her; she longed to be alone; her heart seemed to expand with joy, yet she felt an almost irresistible desire to weep; and she dreaded, as one dreads a sharp pain, hearing her companions joke and laugh upon the circumstance, which, to her, appeared the important event of her life.</p> 
               <p>The girls, however, had not observed Clara's blushes; all their attention had been turned on Harry Rushton, whom, without appreciating his higher qualities, they all liked for his gentleness, his good nature, and his<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7216-00000062"/> wit-to say nothing of his good looks, which had captivated so many of these very susceptible young ladies, till it was found out that the "handsome Harry" was not to be caught by any manuvres or any advances.</p> 
               <p>Clara, finding she was unobserved, listened eagerly to the conversation. From it she gradually learned the name of the intruder and his connection with the paper, and obtained some insight into his character-at least that portion which lay at the surface.</p> 
               <p>As she walked home that evening with Mary, she essayed several times to tell her that she had seen Mr. Rushton; but each time she attempted to pronounce the name, it died upon her lips. Then she resolved to tell her when they got home, when they should be alone together in their own room. But here, it even appeared more difficult than in the street; and reasoning with herself, she came to the conclusion that, after all, there was nothing to tell, and that it would be both useless and foolish to relate to Mary the mere simple fact, which might have occurred every day, and which Mary probably did think a daily occurrence, that she had seen Mr. Rushton.</p> 
               <p>So she said nothing to Mary, but laid her head on her pillow, watching with impatience for the moment the light should be extinguished. Then, for the first time since her eyes had encountered Harry's, she breathed freely. There she lay, for the first time seeing the dawn before she slumbered-recalling every look and every gesture, and then dwelling again and again on the glance which had by magnetic power penetrated to her heart; and so thinking, it happened that the deep looks of love, the only memory of her father she recalled, became confounded with the dark eyes that had looked on her that day; and so the more distant memory mingled with the present, and the love of her childhood and her imagination were blended with the love which, inspired by sympathy, intellect, and passion, rises like Minerva, armed and powerful from its birth.</p> 
               <p>With Harry Rushton, the impression was not evanescent, for Clara had first appealed to his imagination; and when he heard and saw her, she for the first time realized the vision his poetic fancy had created from the name when first he heard it, though he had utterly forgotten the real being, and had never thought of inquiring what had become of her. But now, there she stood, the very first realized dream that had ever charmed the poet-and Harry could never again forget her.</p> 
               <p>He grew restless and uneasy-wandered from barroom to billiard-room, though he was neither intemperate nor a gambler. Having no home, he knew not<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7216-00000063"/> where else to go. His friends, that is, those whose weariness and dullness delighted in his wit and buoy ancy of spirit, wondered what had come over him, and began to think Harry Rushton was getting stupid; so they looked round for some other mental excitement, just as when one brand of Cogniac, from which they obtained physical excitement, grew stale, they would seek for another.</p> 
               <p>Harry, though so well used to the rough ways of the world and the society of man, was timid with the other sex, to whose society he had never been accustomed.</p> 
               <p>After various manuvres to see and speak to Clara, all of which failed from want of courage to carry them out, chance befriended him.</p> 
               <p>Mary, who was very near-sighted, stumbled on a stone in the street and sprained her ancle-so that, not having any other messenger, she asked Clara, before going into the press-room, to proceed to the office of Mr. Rushton, and give the copy she was bound to furnish daily for the paper. Then Mary, thinking Clara's hesitation arose from having to go alone, asked her father to accompany her.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Edwards very unwillingly granted this request; for on the road he confided to Clara that he was just now on a most important chapter, besides writing various rious most remarkable articles for Sunday papers-so Clara told him that a friend of hers lived close by where they lived, and would come with her, and that she was not the least afraid.</p> 
               <p>"Good-by, then, darling," said Mr. Edwards; "that's all right, and you will be very safe with a nice young lady; she will take care of you, I'm sure. Mind you are not late, or Mary will scold."</p> 
               <p>Clara entered the printing office with a beating heart. A door to the right led, she knew, to Mr. Rushton's office; she had already planned what she was to say, and how she was to say it, and how she was to look reserved and unconcerned; for she had so dwelt on the radiant glance which had penetrated to her heart, that, ignorant of love, she imagined the indescribable feeling she experienced to be fear, and that it was fear alone which made her cheek burn and her whole frame tremble.</p> 
               <p>Resolutely, however, she walked up to the door; but just as, with her hand on the handle, she was about to turn it, her courage abandoned her, and the luminous idea crossed her brain, that Mr. Russell could as well fulfill Mary's mission as herself.</p> 
               <p>With a brisk step she turned from the door, and ran eagerly towards the foreman, extending her package towards him.</p> 
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7216-00000064"/> 
               <p>"Mr. Russell," said she, "will you have the goodness to take this to-to"-she hesitated; she could not utter the name; so she merely added in a low tone, "to the Editor's office?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, Miss Clara," said Mr. Russell; "certainly, Miss Clara, I'll be glad to do something for <emph>you,</emph> for you do sing like any bird; you quite do a young man's heart good, Miss Clara-a poor lone young man as has no home nor no wife to keep him company; for I ain't married, Miss Clara," added the foreman, with a smirk.</p> 
               <p>"Indeed," said Clara, abstractedly.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, indeed," replied Mr. Russell, astonished that such a declaration had not provoked from Clara, as it would from other girls, a conscious, "La my, Mr. Russell!" and a coquettish giggle.</p> 
               <p>"I'm sorry," said Clara, not in the least knowing what she said-</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no call to be sorry; guess I can get plenty of girls to have me. It ain't easy to get a young fellow like me, as makes eighteen dollars a week, every day."</p> 
               <p>So saying, Mr. Russell, leaving Clara to meditate on these last words, which he meant to be the preliminary to his courting the "foreign fly-girl," and opening the door of Harry's office with a bang of his fist, rushed into his presence; whilst Clara, watching the door bang to after him, slowly proceeded to the press-room, angry with herself and ready to cry, that she should have lost the only opportunity she had of seeing Harry Rushton again.</p> 
               <p>It had been Harry's foolish custom, of late, to watch Clara, every evening, from the door step of a coffeehouse, as she went home with Mary-taking good care not to show himself, though every evening as he took his station, he made up his mind to speak to Miss Edwards, but each time Clara appeared, his resolution had failed him.</p> 
               <p>On the evening in question, he saw all the girls come out of the office, giggling, talking, romping, and ogling in every direction, as usual. At last, he beheld Clara; but instead of Mary for an escort, she walked side by side with Miss Esther Jenkins.</p> 
               <p>No sooner did Harry Rushton perceive this, than dashing after them up Chestnut street, he almost ran till he came to Arch street, along which he knew they must pass to get to Mary's home; and then, proceeding down the street, met them as they turned into it from Third street.</p> 
               <p>"Good evening, Miss Esther," said he to Clara's companion. "You are late, are you not?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I always wait for the 'girls' to get off-one<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7216-00000065"/> don't want to be with such a common herd, you know, Mr. Rushton. Mr. Rushton," added she, with an affected imitation of fine ladyism, learned in no very good school, "Mr. Rushton, Clara Edwards-Miss Edwards, Mr. Rushton."</p> 
               <p>Miss Edwards made an inclination of the head, but did not raise her eyes; whilst Harry took off his hat and made a bow, looking straight and intently at the well polished door-knob of a prim, white street-door before him. He, however, murmured to himself, <q>
                     <l>"The Rubicon is passed!"</l>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>"This is a very slow city, ain't it?" said Esther, curling her pretty mouth with disdain; "there ain't never nothing agoing on. Oh my, New York's such a fast place-such lots of balls, such operas, such theatres! I declare I shall die of the blues, if I stay here much longer."</p> 
               <p>"Don't die," said Harry, perfectly at ease with Esther; "we can't afford to lose such pretty women as you; you know they don't grow on every tree."</p> 
               <p>"La, now, you're a flatterer! but I'm up to you. I know men well enough not to be took in by their fine speeches, and I dare say you don't mean it all. Now if the truth was known, you think Miss Edwards much prettier than I am!"</p> 
                
               <p>"Miss Edwards" blushed and shrunk behind Esther; Harry wishing he could sink Miss Jenkins five fathoms deep, for presuming to compare herself to Clara, responded gallantly:</p> 
               <p>"Comparisons are odious, you know, Miss Esther; but let us talk a little about your low spirits. I'm quite shocked, I really am, to hear you complain of the blues. What do you say, now, to a visit to the theatre?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I should like it of all things! la, that would be nice! Do give me some tickets; I'll try and find a beau."</p> 
               <p>"You have, I'm sure, too many strings to yours to want beaux. However, if you will accept me with my tickets, I shall be delighted to take you to-morrow-night; and, perhaps," added Harry, making a violent effort, "your friend, Miss Clara, will accompany you?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes; wont you like that, Clara-wont that be nice? I dare say you don't go often?"</p> 
               <p>"Often!" said Clara; "I never was at a theatre-never in all my life."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, my! ain't that funny! and you almost seventeen! My! but it will be as good as a play to see how surprised you'll be. Yes, Mr. Rushton, we'll go, to be sure."</p> 
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7216-00000066"/> 
               <p>"But," said Clara, "Mary may-"</p> 
               <p>"Well now, you ain't a baby, are you? Just tell Mary you're going to the theatre, or don't tell her at all. I suppose you are big enough to do as you like, eh?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Mary is very kind, and I think-"</p> 
               <p>"I hope Miss Edwards will make no objections. We will bring you home safely to your own door, afterwards," added Henry, in a most distant and respectful tone.</p> 
               <p>"Never you mind, she shall come, Mr. Rushton. You come and fetch me at my boarding-house-you know where that is, for you used to come with Tom. Poor Tom! I wish-well never mind, I wont say what I wish."</p> 
               <p>"No, don't," said Harry, whispering to Esther as he took his leave, "only bring Clara, and I'll give you any thing you wish."</p> 
               <p>"oh! is it so?" said Esther to herself; "well, you are caught at last! Just like you, to be taken by that baby face!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I should so like to go with you!" exclaimed Clara, who felt happier than she had done for many days. "I want so to see a theatre! I've read so many plays; and I've always wondered how they could be acted."</p> 
                
               <p>"Clara," said Esther, suddenly turning towards her, with a tone totally different from the flippancy of manner and voice in which she had spoken to Harry; "Clara," said she, "although Miss Edwards may have been kind to you as a child, she has no right to keep you eternally a child. You're young and she ain't, and a little pleasure is what you've a right to, and I'd have it too. Besides, don't you gain your own living, and haven't you a right to spend your own money?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Esther, if I was as rich as Crsus, I never could repay what Mary Has done for me."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't know how rich Mr. Croelig;sus may have been, nor who he is; I don't know any such man; but what I know is, that such a pretty girl as you, was never meant to work all day, and then to mope up all the evening at home with an old man and an old maid. Why, I know you think it monstrous slow work, only you doesn't say so. Don't you ever look in the glass and think how pretty you are, and how much you would be admired?"</p> 
               <p>"Admired, Esther! I only want to be loved," said Clara.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, then you do want to be loved! Come, that's very well for such a demure little puss! And who told you any thing about love?"</p> 
               <p>"Dante, Byron, Shakspeare-my own dreams-the<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7216-00000067"/> music I hear-the airs I sing-my own heart, and my mother's last words," added Clara, in a solemn tone.</p> 
               <p>Esther did not reply, and they walked on in silence, till they came within sight of Clara's home. There Esther bid Clara good-by, saying to her, with a smile and a look of affection:</p> 
               <p>"Well, Clara, remember to-morrow evening; and don't forget, that if you want to be loved you must first be admired, and that if you want to be admired, you've only to show yourself, for you're a sweet, pretty creature, and no mistake."</p> 
               <p>Clara entered the little sitting-room with a beaming, radiant smile; and going up to Mary, and then to Mr. Edwards, she embraced them, one after the other, with an effusion which of late had been unusual. Mary was glad to see that the pensiveness which had oppressed Clara had vanished, and greeted her cheerfully too. Clara was very happy, and she wished she could diffuse the happiness she felt on all around her. She even got courage to ask Mary's permission to go with Esther to the theatre; though she did not mention Harry's name. Mary at first refused; then, seeing the disappointment depicted on her countenance, she thought of her own youth, and remembering how monotonous had been that of Clara, she, not without some misgivings, gave her consent.</p> 
                
               <p>At an early hour they all retired to rest. Clara shared Mary's room, and was, therefore, forced to remain tranquilly in her bed, as though she had been asleep; though the agitation of her mind, and the emotions of her heart, made her anxious and wakeful. She had in a few short moments sat under the tree of knowledge, if as yet she had not tasted its fruits; and the last words of Esther haunted her, and ever rung in her ears.</p> 
               <p>To be loved she must be admired; to be admired she must be pretty. Was she really pretty? Was she pretty enough--? Even to herself she did not finish the phrase; but nevertheless, her thoughts were with Harry, and for the first time she analyzed her own features, as she remembered them, and began to doubt and to fear that Esther's affirmation that she was a "sweet, pretty creature," was untrue.</p> 
               <p>At length, hearing by Mary's breathing, that she slept, Clara softly arose from her bed, and snatching up a large plaid shawl, which Mary had left on a chair close by, she crept with bare feet stealthily from the room. Noiselessly she passed Mr. Edwards' door-cautiously she descended the stairs, and pushing open the parlor door, proceeded to turn up the gaslight left glimmering-the only light that burned all night.</p> 
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7216-00000068"/> 
               <p>Then she closed the door and locked it; then she visited the shutters, and saw that they were safely closed; then, still looking round her cautiously-her tiny white feet stepping without any echo, she, blushing, though she was alone, went up to the long, narrow, old-fashioned glass, in a prim walnut frame, which hung between the windows, and looked intently on her own image reflected there.</p> 
               <p>There she stood, in her long white night-dress, her full bust and finely-moulded shoulder closely enveloped, yet distinctly defined, in the shawl drawn tightly around her. Open in front, however, the lovely throat and the white neck were revealed in their modest purity. The masses of her hair, fallen from the comb which alone upheld them at night, fell in mazes of light around her; her eyes sparkled, her cheek burned, her bosom heaved; and as she gazed, a consciousness of beauty stole over her, making her yet more lovely-till the burning blush spread to her forehead; her heart beat violently, and a film of shame and pleasure obscured her sight. Then, burying her face in her hands, she murmured softly,</p> 
               <p>"Harry!"</p> 
               <p>For the first time her lips had formed the word, though, since she had heard it first, her inmost soul had hymned no other to her.</p>

               <p>THE next evening, Clara and Miss Jenkins were the first to leave the work-room, and together they proceeded to Esther's boarding-house.</p> 
               <p>Miss Esther Jenkins was not one of those young ladies who lived in the boarding-houses we have described, as the usual <emph>home</emph> of girls of her class. Some mysterious means, which certainly concerned only Miss Jenkins and her landlady, enabled this very pretty fly-girl to have, in a moderately clean house, in the upper part of Race street, a room all to herself.</p> 
               <p>The furniture in it was also the undisputed property of Miss Esther herself. It was with no little feeling of gratified vanity that Esther, taking Clara through the<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7216-00000069"/> hall with its well-worn, gaudy oil-cloth, then up the stairs with a threadbare carpet, from which the rods half detached left the carpet to hang in slovenly tatters over the stairs, making the ascent a matter of some danger; threw open the door on the second floor, and ushered her young friend into her room. A very thick tapestry carpet, and a whole set of enameled cottage furniture, together with embroidered lace curtains, made this room appear to have been stolen bodily from some other abode, so little was it in keeping with the sordid appearance of the house in which it was.</p> 
               <p>"How pretty!" exclaimed Clara, looking at the groups of flowers on the centre-table.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Esther, throwing herself into the inevitable rocking-chair, and commencing vehemently to use its soothing rockers-"Yes," said she, "that was poor Tom's present. Lor, he gave me any thing I liked, did Tom!"</p> 
               <p>"Was Tom your brother?" asked Clara.</p> 
               <p>"Lor, my dear, no! Tom was a very good friend to me. When he was here I never went to that beggarly press-room. Oh my! I do so hate work! don't you?"</p> 
               <p>"Well," replied Clara, "I don't know; but I'm afraid I do; at least I don't like the monotonous, tiresome work we do in the press-room."</p> 
                
               <p>"I thought you didn't-it's all very well for the common herd, but girls as isn't quite inferior can't put up with such drudgery, particularly as it's so easy to find friends that will help them, and support them handsomely too, and never have any work to do all the blessed day, but what I'm a-doing now; and then in the evening, theatres, and balls, and concerts, and such pleasant carriage rides in summer to the falls!"</p> 
               <p>"I wish poor dear Mary and Mr. Edwards could have found such friends; poor Mary has had to work very hard for us all, I can tell you; and that's the reason I was so glad to be even a fly-girl, because I could help them."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! ah!" exclaimed Esther Jenkins, with a laugh; "guess you don't help them much with two dollars and a half a week, any how. Why, Clara, child, you might help them now, if you chose! If you only saw a little of the world, you might make your fortune. Do take off that ugly old straw bonnet-you ain't agoing to the theatre in that. I'll lend you my pink crape, and my Canton crape shawl-only wait one minute."</p> 
               <p>Miss Jenkins arose, and opening a closet, produced from a hat-box a pink crape bonnet, of the most recent fashion; then, opening a drawer, from the midst of a collection of dirty and clean under-sleeves, collars of every price, old gloves, odd stockings, glass brooches,<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7216-00000070"/> and old artificial flowers, she dragged forth a magnificent white crape shawl, to the fringe of which clung, but were quickly detached by Miss Jenkins, two or three pawnbroker's tickets, a false plait, and a broken bracelet. Folding the shawl, she threw it over Clara's shoulders, the admirable contour of which, made the beautiful texture fall with exquisite grace. Then, throwing Clara's black straw bonnet contemptuously on the bed, she carefully tied on the pink crape bonnet, arranging with tasteful care all the clustering flowers round the blooming and beautiful face of her young friend.</p> 
               <p>As they were standing thus, a gentle knock at the door was heard, and Esther replying by,</p> 
               <p>"Come in,"</p> 
               <p>It was opened, and Harry Rushton entered the room.</p> 
               <p>"Ain't she beautiful, Mr. Rushton?" exclaimed Esther, as Clara blushed deeper than her pink bonnet.</p> 
               <p>"Really, Miss Jenkins," said Harry, admiring the beautiful creature before him, made still more beautiful by the addition of dress-for, spite of poets, dress does embellish nature; "it required your taste to add to Miss Edwards' beauty; but then you are so pretty yourself, that you can afford to be generous."</p> 
               <p>Harry said these flattering words in rather a contemptuous temptuous manner, for he felt an indefinite disappointment in finding his <foreign xml:lang="ITA">Perdita,</foreign> for such Clara was to him, standing before a glass, decked by the hands of a vulgar woman, and absorbed, like the other frivolous, heartless, brainless women he had known, in the merits of a new bonnet.</p> 
               <p>Now, spite of Harry and poetry, Clara, though possessed of genius, a true and tender heart, and all the qualities which, in after life, make up a noble, high-minded woman, did admire both the bonnet, and the way it became her. She knew nothing of the class of women of which Harry had so poor an opinion, and, therefore, felt gratified that the person she wished best to please, should see her at so favorable a moment. His presence, however, recalled to her mind the object of his visit, and eagerly untieing the lustrous satin strings, she turned towards Rushton, exclaiming:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Rushton, we shall perhaps be late, and I would not miss the very, very beginning, for the world!"</p> 
               <p>"We are not late, Miss Edwards, only just in time; so, Miss Jenkins, if you please-"</p> 
               <p>"Here, Esther, is your bonnet," said Clara, taking it off, and disengaging herself from the folds of the shawl.</p> 
               <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7216-00000071"/> 
               <p>"What are you doing?" exclaimed Esther; "I don't want the bonnet; I mean you to wear it, you little silly thing, and make the people think what handsome things you've got, and all the girls will wonder who gave them to you; for that is a handsome hat-it cost twelve dollars; and that Canton crape, I know, was paid eighty dollars, because I went to the store where it was bought, and asked what Mr. Mil-well, what was paid for it."</p> 
               <p>"Eighty and twelve, ninety-two, is it not, Mr. Rushton? How long it would take me to pay for such beautiful things! I wish I had a great many of them, for I love every thing that is beautiful; but then they must be all my own. Wearing them when they did not belong to me, would be like telling a falsehood, and that I wouldn't do for all the beautiful things in the world."</p> 
               <p>Clara, as she spoke, resumed her black straw bonnet, lined with deep blue, and Harry, who was no appreciator of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chef-d'uvres</foreign> of milliners, thought this a much prettier bonnet than the pink crape.</p> 
               <p>Esther shrugged her shoulders, and, throwing the bonnet on the bed, took from another hat-box, another bonnet of a different hue. She didn't choose Rushton should think she had but one crape hat; if she had but known, that he never even noticed the change, she might have spared herself that trouble. Now, wrapping a handsome velvet mantle, all bedizened with embroidery, round her, she declared herself "ready."</p> 
               <p>"Have you no other friends, Miss Jenkins, you would like to take?" said Rushton; "we have a private box."</p> 
               <p>"La, my! Well, then, I needn't have titivated myself up in this way; nobody will See us. You know I haven't got anybody I'd like to take," said Miss Jenkins; "if I had, I wouldn't be working in your press-room, you may be pretty sure of that. I wont work long, you may be sure of that too; I'm just sick of it, now."</p> 
               <p>"Well, we shall find a beau for you, I dare say. So, let us be off."</p> 
               <p>The play was, "Much Ado About Nothing," played by the stock company of the -- theatre, just then suffering from a dearth of stars, and a dearth of audiences, as might be inferred by an editor having a private box; for if there had been any thing worth seeing, according to the delectable habit of managers, the "press," though admitted in virtue of their office, would have found no seat at all.</p> 
               <p>When Clara first entered the house, she looked around her with childish curiosity; but no sooner did the curtain rise, than her whole undivided attention was given to the stage.</p> 
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7216-00000072"/> 
               <p>When the curtain fell after the first act, Rushton asked Clara if she was pleased.</p> 
               <p>"I don't know," replied she; "I am puzzled with the impression the play makes on me, now that I see it acted. Don't ask me what I think of it till the end. I have read the play so often, that I know it by heart. Do you think, Mr. Rushton, there is a newer edition of Shakspeare than that I have read? for the actors do not say the words as I have read them."</p> 
               <p>"The actors," said Harry, who was a profoud admirer of the drama, and, therefore, hated theatre as they are now, "make an edition of their own. Miss Edwards. Perhaps, you don't think it an improvement?"</p> 
               <p>"I confess I do not; but then, you know, I am no judge, for I never was at a theatre before."</p> 
               <p>"All the better judge for that, I should think."</p> 
               <p>"Now don't stay talking fine," said Esther, leaning over to Harry, so that Clara could not hear; "I know what you're up to, and I don't blame you-I'm glad to see handsome Harry caught, at last. Only you get me a beau; I'm sure if you go out and take a drink, you'll find somebody, for it's precious dull for me-I never could bear Shakspeare; and, Mr. Rushton," added she, as Harry rose to obey, "do bring some candy and some oranges, for I'm bored to death."</p> 
                
               <p>Harry Rushton remained but a short time absent; he was accompanied on his return by a gentleman of the description by some called flashy, but which Esther called stylish, and whose undisguised stare of admiration made her bridle up, settle her under-sleeves, giggle, and give a pull at her bonnet; while Harry, depositing a few oranges and a paper of candy in her lap, introduced the stranger as,</p> 
               <p>"Colonel Horatio C. Stubbins," the editor and proprietor of the <hi rend="i"/>"Vertical Ray"-a new slashing evening paper, thought uncommonly smart, and ahead of the times, by a great many people, but totally ignored by the orthodox public and journalism of the day.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Stubbins-a colonel who, like many other colonels in the United States, had not joined his regiment, for the simple reason, that he was perfectly in ignorance of where it was quartered-had been exceedingly struck with the dashing appearance of Miss Jenkins, and after their introduction to each other, he and Esther struck up a violent flirtation, which left Clara to the full enjoyment of the play, and Rushton to the contemplation of Clara, and his own dreams and imaginings, concerning her.</p> 
               <p>At the end of the first piece, Esther declared herself tired, and on a motion of the Colonel, it was proposed to adjourn to Parkinson's, in order to restore, by<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7216-00000073"/> some delicate refreshments, the exhausted strength of Miss Jenkins, who from the moment the Colonel had entered the box, had become suddenly transformed into a fine lady.</p> 
               <p>Clara, when they left the theatre, resolutely refused to accompany Miss Jenkins to Parkinson's, wherever that might be, of which she was entirely ignorant.</p> 
               <p>"I promised Mary," said she, "to return directly home; and though it's very kind of you to take me somewhere else, I must insist upon going home."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I declare!" said Miss Jenkins, waxing wroth; "and do you think I'm going to miss a delightful time at Parkinson's, just to take you home? That's a good idea indeed! Besides, the Colonel has been so polite as to ask you," added Miss Jenkins, while she turned towards her new-found admirer.</p> 
               <p>"And I should die if you disappointed me," gallantly interrupted the Colonel.</p> 
               <p>"I do not wish to disappoint you," said Clara; "but perhaps Mr. Rushton, who knows Mary, will oblige her by taking me home."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I dare say he will," said Esther, with a giggle-"won't you, Mr. Rushton?" Then putting her head under Clara's bonnet, she whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Well, I never did know any thing better than that! My! but you're smart! Well-still water, they say, runs deep! Good night, then," continued she, aloud, "a pleasant walk to you!"</p> 
               <p>Clara did not in the least understand the inuendo conveyed in this speech, nor did Harry choose to notice the sly wink which accompanied it; he had merely replied to Clara's request by a bow of acquiescence, and offering his arm to her, they proceeded towards Tower street.</p> 
               <p>"Tell me now," said Harry, as they went, "how you liked the play."</p> 
               <p>"I hope," said Clara, "you will not think me ungrateful for the trouble you have had in taking me; but to tell the truth, I am sorry I have seen one of my favorite plays acted. It was far more beautiful in my imagination, than it is now, that I have seen it realized. Not one of the people was at all like what I had fancied them. I am glad poems cannot be acted," continued she, "for then they too would be made to lose their charm."</p> 
               <p>"O, Miss Edwards, I am afraid you have taken your first lesson in life! You will find-at least I have found-that all which our imagination creates, crumbles to dust when brought to the level of the world. Nothing real ever satisfies our imagination."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, don't say that," said Clara; "I, in my short life, have found many real things that satisfied my<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7216-00000074"/> imagination. Mary, as a personification of patient, untiring goodness, is one reality, passing all imagining. Then I have watched the heavens, with the golden purple clouds, change gradually to gray and silver, till the pale moon came forth, and the thousand stars glittered on the deep blue ground. Do you think our imagination could create a brighter heaven? Then music, I am sure, must be able to satisfy the imagination; and then, oh, I have fancied there must be countries with blue lakes, high mountains, and waving trees, such as one dreams of. And I often long to fly like a bird over those tall chimneys, away from these long, long rows of houses, all the same, with their doors always closed; and I am sure that all one dreams must be but a presentiment of what will one day be realized. Don't you think so, Mr. Rushton? Though I did not like the play-I mean the real play-I have been so happy this evening, it seems as if in some way it had been the realization of some of my dreams-day-dreams and fancies, I mean. Oh, I am not afraid of realities. Did you never find any thing real, to equal what you imagined?"</p> 
               <p>"Never but one," replied Harry, looking at her in the clear moonlight, as she raised her serene and radiant eyes to him.</p> 
               <p>"And that?" asked she.</p> 
               <p>"Is yourself," said Harry.</p>

               <p>FROM the evening Esther and Clara went to the theatre, they continued to leave the office at the same time, and to return home every evening together.</p> 
               <p>Harry Rushton always joined them, and he had long conversations with Clara-for Colonel Horatio Stubbins was always sure to join the party at the corner of some street, and keep Esther in a perpetual spasm of laughter and excitement.</p> 
               <p>Though each interview increased the natural passion, which had dawned in their hearts from the first glance they had exchanged, the word love had never been exchanged between Rushton and Clara, yet neither doubted the other's affection.</p> 
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7216-00000075"/> 
               <p>Like gems in a cave, lying dull and ignored till the torch of the miner flashes upon them, was Clara's mind and genius, till love called forth all their treasures. Harry, as each hour, each word, revealed some new charm and increased his passion, could not but wonder, as he remembered Mary's refinement of manner and her finished education, that she had cast her proteg into a condition of life so utterly unfitted for her, and, to one so beautiful, so full of peril.</p> 
               <p>One evening, finding themselves some distance from their companions, they had turned into Logan Square.</p> 
               <p>"Clara," said he, for he had ceased to call her by the commonplace appellation bestowed on her by her protectors; "Clara, is Miss Edwards really kind to you?"</p> 
               <p>"Kind!" exclaimed Clara; "she is, I told you, goodness itself. She has supported me, clothed me, educated me, Since I was a little child: she has made me what I am."</p> 
               <p>"And having made you what you are, how comes it that she has made you descend to the position of a fly-girl? You-know it is unworthy of you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, do not blame Mary!" said Clara; "I assure you she has done it all for the best. I know that perhaps I might have been made a teacher, or an artist; but poor Mary has had to struggle so hard to obtain occupation from intellectual labor, that she dreaded the same struggles for me, and preferred, she said, giving me a trade, which is a certainty, and ensures, at least, an independence, and certain occupation."</p> 
               <p>"But did you not express any definite wish?"</p> 
               <p>"No," said Clara; "because, though I had wishes and aspirations, they were very indefinite. I thought I should like to have been an actress, and embody all those beautiful thoughts and scenes of the poets, which have so enchanted me; but since I have seen the theatre, and actors, and actresses, I find that was not what I wanted. I think, however, though I have never heard an opera, I should like to be a singer-that is, to express sublime thoughts in song. Music is what I like best."</p> 
               <p>"And you yourself are worthy of that most magnificent of the arts. Oh, Clara, I cannot bear that you should be in such unworthy society as I found you, surrounded by degraded women and vulgar men. You cannot think how I suffer for you-how I feel inclined to fly away with you to some remote corner of the earth, where none could ever find us; for Clara, dearest Clara, you know I love you!"</p> 
               <p>Clara blushed deeply, and was silent for an instant, while her frame trembled, and she leaned heavily on Harry's arm for support; then, raising her eyes to his, she replied, in low but distinct accents:</p> 
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7216-00000076"/> 
               <p>"Yes, dearest Harry, I knew you loved me-I felt it here in my heart, in my inmost soul, from the first hour I saw you; and since that hour, my wild thoughts, my childish dreams and fancies, have all changed. You have asked me whether I was content with my life. Yes, I am happy, satisfied, contented; I have no aspirations; I think I am a woman now. Your love seems to have been the destiny that loomed so mysteriously before me-the imaginings of my past life were but dreams of you. Since you have loved me, music is sweeter, my own favorite poets have a new meaning, the very heavens are brighter. I am so happy, so happy! And yet, I am not joyous. Mary says I have grown still and silent. Oh, Harry! I can sit for hours, lost in thoughts of you, and of the love I knew you felt for me; it wanted not the words you have spoken to tell it me."</p> 
               <p>"Then you love me, Clara?"</p> 
               <p>"As I love my father's image graven in my brain-as I love my dead mother's memory, enshrined in my heart."</p> 
               <p>"Then you will be mine, my own beloved?'</p> 
               <p>"Yours alone-all yours," replied Clara, turning her true, pure glance upon him; "your true, your faithful wife forever."</p> 
               <p>Henry started; and, beneath her gaze, it was his turn to blush.</p> 
                
               <p>Henry Rushton, we have said, had been left to the fitful bringing up of chance; no mother had ever hallowed his feelings-no father had ever guided him through the perilous paths of the world.</p> 
               <p>Debarred from the enjoyment of all the holy bonds of the family, Harry had followed the first of the newfangled and fanciful creeds which social reform, the mania of the nineteenth century, was every day developing. He considered the family as a selfish, senseless institution, and disdained marriage as unworthy of a being of sense, genius, and passion.</p> 
               <p>From the first dawn of his love for Clara, he had rejoiced in her being isolated from the usual bonds of family and society, and had resolved to realize his theories by his enlightened and <emph>passional</emph> association with this fair and gifted young creature, untrammeled by the forms which <emph>civilization</emph> considered necessary to hallow love.</p> 
               <p>These principles, partly imbibed from Fourier, partly from commentators and improvers on the most incomprehensible of theorists, this same Fourier-made Harry Rushton start, when Clara, gazing on him with her clear, pure glance, pronounced the word "wife."</p> 
               <p>For the first time, as it fell from her lips, the sacredness of the word, the divine nature of that holy tie,<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7216-00000077"/> was revealed to his inmost soul; but still, habit, his own stubborn self-love, his vanity, a fear of the world's dread laugh, and the desire to be true to himself, made him determine to give <emph>civilization,</emph> which to reformers is barbarism, a bright example of enlightenment, and freedom from the prejudices of tradition, which entrammeled the world. Therefore, not without a violent effort, however, and without daring to look at her, he replied to Clara, whose eyes, beaming with love, were still intently fixed on him:</p> 
               <p>"Clara," said he, "you are the loveliest, purest of women. You have entranced my whole being, given me new life, made the world, of which I was weary, grow young and fresh again. You have filled my heart with passion-my soul with deep devotion; I love you, you are my first love, though I have tried, nay, yearned to love many; but all have been so far beneath my ideas of women-all, in the first dawn of passion, have destroyed the feelings they strove to evoke. You only, my bright and beautiful one, have surpassed the ideal-you alone combine poetry and passion, the elements of my nature; yes, Clara, mine you shall be; but not the vulgar slave the world calls a wife. You shall be mine, yet free and unfettered shall you be; all I possess shall be yours; should the riches of the earth be mine, you shall share them; but the laws shall not compel me to give them to you. Mine you shall be-my own, my chosen one, the beloved of my soul-not my wife, but my worshiped, my idolized mistress."</p> 
               <p>Clara stopped abruptly, as Harry ceased speaking; a deep shadow passed over her face, and her delicate and almost infantile features assumed a dignity and seventy of expression which startled her lover, who, animated by the fervency of his subject, had for some time been intently gazing at her. Presently she heaved a profound sigh, and turning pale, her eyes sought the ground, and she stretched out her hand as if for support.</p> 
               <p>Harry, seeing her stagger, put his arm half round her to support her; but when he touched her, she recoiled from him, and regaining her strength on the instant, without looking at him she said, in a voice which, though it trembled not, was deep and husky:</p> 
               <p>"Let us go home."</p> 
               <p>"Home, Clara! without answering me! What have I said that could offend you?-what can I say to convince you, if you doubt it, of my devoted love!"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing more," said Clara, hastily, "say nothing more."</p> 
               <p>"But will you not speak to me? See, we are nearly at the door of your house-you will not leave me thus? Oh Clara, you do not love me!"</p> 
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7216-00000078"/> 
               <p>"Never think that, Harry; I have told you that I loved you; I have never, since I first lisped my prayers by my dead mother's side, uttered a falsehood. Here, as we now stand, my hand in yours, with the stars stealing forth to look on us-those holy stars that beamed on me the night my poor mother died-I again tell you that I love you. God bless you, Harry!" added Clara; and, withdrawing her hand and turning down into the little street in which she lived, she motioned Harry not to follow, and soon he saw her disappear within her own door.</p> 
               <p>When Clara entered the little parlor, she was so pale, so altered, that Mary threw off her bonnet hastily, and winding her arms round her, pressed her to her bosom, and anxiously inquired if she was ill.</p> 
               <p>Clara looked up and strove to speak; a faint smile just passed for an instant over her quivering lips; then, burying her head in Mary's bosom, she burst into tears.</p> 
               <p>Mary, to whom the emotions of the heart were no stranger-Mary, who had felt both mental and physical sufferings-tenderly drew Clara to the sofa; then, seating herself by her side, she silently and patiently waited until the paroxysm should be over. Then, when Clara's sobs subsided, and the tears began to dry on her pale cheek, she put her arms round her, and smothing ing back the long hair which had fallen over her face, she said, in a low, tender voice,</p> 
               <p>"My child, do not weep as one without consolation. Am I not here? Tell me what great sorrow has overtaken your young heart; for I see it is not physical suffering which has bowed you down."</p> 
               <p>"No, dearest Mary, no; but a great sorrow, when I hoped to bring you tidings of great joy, that would have made us all so happy! And now I never can be happy again!"</p> 
               <p>"Poor child!" said Mary, "I will not speak to you now of time and its healing power, nor of your youth; but tell me what I have to console, and then-"</p> 
               <p>"Mary," said Clara, "there is nothing to console, and little to relate; but, strong and courageous as you have tried to make me, I cannot tell you any thing now. Trust me; I weep, but I have committed no fault. I am unhappy, oh, so unhappy! but I have not deserved it. And, Mary, dear, you know how much I love you, and how deep is my gratitude to you. I know that to tell my sorrows to you would be to find relief; but, dearest Mary, I feel to-night as though I wanted neither relief nor consolation-all I desire is to be alone, with my own feelings and my own heart. Do you understand me, Mary, and are you not offended with me?"</p> 
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7216-00000079"/> 
               <p>"I understand you, my darling," said Mary, "and I believe you when you tell me you have not deserved your present unhappiness. We will not speak of it again to-night-but you shall rest here-you shall have the night to yourself, as you desire it. I will bring you some pillows; go and wrap yourself in your dressing-gown, and then you shall rest here alone; I will not even disturb your communings with yourself; and so you will get calm, and to-morrow, my love--"</p> 
               <p>"To-morrow you shall know all," said Clara, embracing Mary, and rising to leave the room.</p> 
               <p>"Poor child!" said Mary, looking after her; "there can be but one source of sorrow at her age-the hardest one to bear comes oftener in our tenderest youth; but though it rarely kills, it scathes and leaves a scar behind, that never wholly heals."</p> 
               <p>Clara, when by Mary's tender care left to the solitude of the little sitting-room, arose from the couch on which Mary had laid her, and going to the door, she locked it.</p> 
               <p>Then, with contracted brow, and stern, compressed lips, she went to a table, and drawing towards her the writing materials which were upon it, she sat down, and with a firm hand, she wrote:</p> 
               <p>"The first letter I ever wrote in my life is this, Harry, which I now address to you. It is probably the last you will ever receive from me.</p> 
               <p>"My heart was too full to answer you to-night; and though from my childhood I have known trials, which have taught me courage beyond my age; my nature is timid in the presence of those I love; yet what I would have said, you must hear-for though I had not words to utter it, my answer, which you asked for, contains our fate, and-</p> 
               <p>"Henry, I love you! Deem not over-bold this plain confession of my love. I have been brought up in solitude, away from the forms of all that is called society; but I know that it would command more maidenly reserve. Still, I will repeat the words, renew the assurance of the deep affection which I feel-again will I write the words that have a charm for me, and linger over them-for I shall never write them again. I love you, Harry; but I never will be yours.</p> 
               <p>"I would have believed, have trusted you, have toiled for you, have borne misfortune, have encountered any fate with you, your true, your loving wife. And you, oh, Harry! you distrust me in this, the very budding of our love! you fear to bind yourself to me forever; even when you ask me to be wholly yours, you are preparing for the time, that we can part. You call our love holy, and would degrade me, sink me even lower<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7216-00000080"/> than those of my companions whose association with me you so hate-for they, Harry, have lived from their infancy a life of degradation and ignorance, whilst we boast of higher faculties and nobler aspirations, which lift us far above this common, sordid world. Oh, genius is not divine, if it inspire not pure and holy actions, as well as great and noble thoughts. Be not deceived: when you thought to dazzle me by placing me, as you strove to persuade me, far above the level of the women you despise, you were but striving to corrupt me.</p> 
               <p>"You called me your mistress, disdaining to call me your wife. No, Harry; though I have lived among poets, dwelt with books and not with men, Mary has instilled into me the sacred law which is the secret guide for all. God has given me woman's instincts, which, like the ermine's, dread a stain. Love, if it taught me passion, taught me too, that even passion cannot live when purity is cast aside. My dead mother, as she clasped me in her arms, as her cold cheek was pressed to mine, bid me never love but one, my husband; and you, Harry, whom I love, as she loved-for since I have loved, much of the unfathomed mystery of her hapless fate is revealed to me-you have broken the heart which so trusted you. Farewell! I think I cannot ever love you less; I know I can never love another; but you have turned my love to bitterness, and your name brings a deep blush to my cheek. After to-morrow, I will never speak it again, but will bury it, with my love, deep in the recesses of my heart forever. Harry, farewell!"</p>

               <p>CLARA'S letter, which she showed to Mary, left very little for Clara to explain. Still, with a calmness which touched Mary to the heart, she told her the simple story of her love. Mary blamed herself for having exposed Clara to the peril through which she had passed, and which at so young an age had taken the bright sunshine from her life. She felt deeply indignant with Harry, and determined to resent the insult he had offered to the young girl who stood to her in the light of a daughter. But Clara entreated that no notice might be taken of it, farther than her own letter; and Mary, feeling her own helplessness, feeling that she was a woman, unprotected and alone, after mature reflection, decided that a contemptuous silence was the wisest course.</p> 
                
               <p>All Mary thought necessary was, that Clara should give up her work in the press-room of the Daily Universe-a measure to which Clara willingly assented.</p> 
               <p>Harry Rushton, when he received the letter, made no effort to see Clara, and never even replied to it; but suddenly resigned his position in the Daily Universe, and betook himself to a distant state, where his well-known pen was soon traced to the popular paper of the place.</p> 
               <p>A long, lingering illness retained Clara for some weeks in the house. Morally, she appeared to have sunk into a state of apathy, while physically, her sufferings, day by day, appeared to destroy her youth and her strength. She was gentle, affectionate, and strove to be cheerful; she would spend whole hours patiently with Mr. Edwards, to whom nothing had been imparted, and who, though he felt deeply grieved at Clara's illness, was charmed to have her for hours quietly by his side, explaining all he wished, and striving to understand and make him comprehend the most difficult of all the intricate theories and the complicated language of the old Italian authors.</p> 
               <p>It must not be supposed that all these events took place without attracting the notice of Miss Esther Jenkins. She was by turns mystified, shocked, and indignant<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7216-00000082"/> dignant, at what she supposed she knew or "guessed." She of course, seeing Harry leave the city, and Clara the press-room, gave a vulgar interpretation to the whole story, and imagined Clara the victim of a base seduction-raved against men in general, and Harry Rushton in particular.</p> 
               <p>Now Miss Esther had really a kind heart-that is, it was disagreeable to her to see people unhappy around her, and she was capable of any effort, which did not involve a personal sacrifice, to make people, as she said, "all right."</p> 
               <p>Nearly about the same time that Clara left her situation, Miss Jenkins also left the occupation of fly-girl. "Horatio C--, I mean the Colonel," said Esther, simpering, "did not like her doing any work-it made her hands red, it spoiled the complexion," etc., etc.</p> 
               <p>Clad in silks, satins, velvets, feathers, and flowers, of which it would be vain to attempt a description, she had several times been to see Clara. Esther, of course, imagined the romance between Clara and Rushton to be at an end, and therefore never referred to him; she imagined, too, that Clara regretted, as she in similar cases had done, not the lover, but the love, and thought that all she wanted to console her was, not Harry Rushton, but some one to supply his place.</p> 
                
               <p>Many were the consultations she had with Colonel Horatio C. Stubbins on the subject-consulting with him on all the eligible young men he knew, who could draw poor dear Clara from that dull, stupid, little house, in which she was buried with an old madman and a prim old maid. But Mary soon put a stop to all these plans, by one day very quietly refusing admittance to Miss Jenkins, and signifying to her, in a most polite but pointed manner, that she declined the honor of that young lady's acquaintance.</p> 
               <p>Great was Miss Jenkins' wrath; and from that hour Mary made for Clara and herself an inveterate enemy, whose power Mary could never have divined-for she knew not that women whose conduct sets every law of propriety at defiance, feel more keenly a slight from a woman, than an insult from a man.</p> 
               <p>Mary, meantime, had redoubled her exertions to minister to the fancies and caprices of the invalid-caprices never expressed, but which her tender affection divined. Fate, which appeared to have darkened over poor Clara, seemed at last to point to a brighter horizon for her protectress.</p> 
               <p>The publishers of the Daily Universe, considerably puzzled by the sudden flight of Mr. Harry Rushton, had inquired and consulted as to the best mode of repairing his loss. Most people had referred them to the<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7216-00000083"/> well-written and clever articles which appeared in their columns, which were not Harry's, and had pointed out their author as the best editor.</p> 
               <p>"Who was it?"</p> 
               <p>Here, again, the worthy proprietors were posed. Could they-no, they never could-declare that it was a woman! That might make people think less of the articles. But they could employ her, and say nothing about her to the public; and then they could make such a good bargain with her-for, being a woman, they might give her much less than they would have to give a man. Not that Mary was less zealous; she was even more so-exact, too, and reliable, which Rushton had never been. Her articles were as popular as his, and she understood the routine of journalism, and the knack of paragraphing, quite as well as he did. But then, she was a woman-therefore, they could give her ten, say twelve dollars, where they gave him twenty. Why? Because she was a woman-that was all they knew-and women were always paid less than men-that everybody knew.</p> 
               <p>Everybody must be right, of course; and women, therefore, have nothing to do but to work, and be thankful for what they can get, and deeply grateful that they are allowed to work at all-particularly the work supposed to require an intellect and an education called masculine. What an honor! Why, that ought to be salary enough of itself!</p> 
               <p>Little as these twelve dollars were, in proportion to the labor they remunerated, they brought perfect ease and comfort into the little household, so that Mary was satisfied to resist all Clara's entreaties to be allowed to resume her labors.</p> 
               <p>Her healthy constitution had quickly banished the physical effects of sorrow from Clara's youthful and healthy frame; but the moral tone of her character was changed. The exuberance of youth was gone, and the young girl looked upon the duties of life, and awaited life's cares and misfortunes, looking with distrust on the world, where before she had thought but on pleasure; and, prepared to trust all, believe and love all, the future had seemed all so bright and lovely.</p> 
               <p>Mary saw with pain the change come over the character of her joyous, bright, adopted child-a change she knew must come, but it had overtaken Clara so prematurely, robbing her of the joyous indifference of her girlish years. She became convinced that the inactivity in which she now lived was injurious to her, and rather nourished her despondency and regrets, so that she consented that, as a mere trial, Clara might resume her occupation.</p> 
               <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7216-00000084"/> 
               <p>Rushton was far away, Esther had gone, and Mary was almost always in the office of the Daily Universe, so that there were no material objections to Clara's returning to her post.</p> 
               <p>Rumor and gossip had, of course, not spared either Clara or Harry; and as long as Esther had continued in the press-room, she had, by her inuendos, her sighs of compassion, her half revelations, and her outbursts of indignation, furnished materials for the wildest surmises, and the most improbable tales, all of which received no inconsiderable embellishment from the active imaginations of twelve or fifteen girls, between the ages of sixteen and six-and-twenty.</p> 
               <p>When Clara, who had come early with Mary, was found one morning by the girls in her usual place in the press-room, she was received by some with a sarcastic compassion, with distant reserve by others, and contemptuous familiarity by the rest. Our heroine was still too much absorbed in her own sorrows, to notice any peculiarity of manner in those around her; there was, besides, a latent disdain in her nature, which would have led her to scorn and despise this first trial of the world's injustice.</p> 
               <p>She proceeded steadily with her work, scarcely aware of the presence of the noisy, babbling girls around her; her voice was hushed, and the "foreign fly-girl's" singing, which had been the boast of the press-room, was no longer spoken of.</p> 
               <p>Now, all Clara's sorrow had not diminished her beauty. It is not sorrow, but evil passions, which leave their mark upon the brow; Clara, though different, was perhaps far more beautiful than before-a fact, which no less a personage than Mr. Russell, the foreman of the printing office, satisfactorily settled with himself, on the first morning of Clara's reappearance.</p> 
               <p>Now Mr. Russell, though a young man-not being over thirty-was, seeing that we live in a country where boys are husbands, considered and called generally an old bachelor. He had several times made up his mind to marry, but something had always interfered with the matrimonial termination to his numerous courtings. He had a dread of the sex, as he saw them in printing offices, bookbinderies, and press-rooms, almost the only places in which he did see them.</p> 
               <p>Clara's quiet and reserved manner, the simplicity of her dress, and the utter absence of the forward pertness of the girls of her class, had, from the few first weeks of his acquaintance with her, made him desire to obtain the modest "fly-girl" for his wife.</p> 
               <p>But all his advances, all his attempts at flattery and compliments, had signally failed. Clara did not appear<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7216-00000085"/> pear to understand them, or, at least, never encouraged them in any way.</p> 
               <p>Miss Esther Jenkins, who was never so fully occupied with her own affairs as not to have time to attend to those of others, had, of course, perceived the state of Mr. Russell's feelings, almost as soon as himself; and, a little out of vanity, and partly out of a spirit of mischief innate in her, had been delighted to communicate Clara's conquest of handsome Harry, while she boasted of her own over the resplendent editor of the "Vertical Ray."</p> 
               <p>Rushton's disappearance, Clara's absence, and Esther's account of the whole matter, related secondhand by the young ladies to Mr. Russell, had given him an entirely wrong impression of the whole affair; and though it destroyed his matrimonial intentions, it rather enhanced his admiration for Clara, and gave him hopes of succeeding in obtaining her good graces. Since another had been able to please her, why should not he? Then she was evidently <emph>lonely,</emph> as Mr. Russell expressed the deep sorrow which oppressed Clara, and wanted a little cheering up.</p> 
               <p>When Clara passed through the printing office, she invariably found Mr. Russell in her way. He would intercept her, and try to enter into conversation, though her calm, quiet manner usually drove all the smart speeches he intended to make out of his mind.</p> 
                
               <p>He tried following her in the street when she left, but almost always Mary was with her; or, if Clara were alone, she was just as frigid in the street as in the office, so that, really, Mr. Russell did not exactly know how next to proceed.</p> 
               <p>He was standing gaping after her, as she walked up the street, having received his usual rebuff, when a most elegant lady, brushing against him with her widespread flounces, tapped him on the arm with her parasol.</p> 
               <p>Looking round, Mr. Russell recognized Esther, in a flutter of magnificence.</p> 
               <p>"Wont do, Mr. Russell; you see it's no go."</p> 
               <p>"Really, Miss Esther, I don't know what you mean," said Mr. Russell, blushing, and trying to look unconscious.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you do, Mr. Russell; so do I. Clara's love scrape has made her prettier than ever. 'Handsome Harry' was a lucky fellow, wasn't he?"</p> 
               <p>"Well now, Miss Esther, are you quite sure about that affair?"</p> 
               <p>"Sure! Ah! ah! that's a good joke! Wasn't I her friend? Didn't it all go on under my very nose? But then, Mr. Rushton wasn't as timid as Mr. Russell, or he might have been dangling all his life. Clara's a sly puss. Good-by, Mr. Russell," added Esther,<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7216-00000086"/> lifting up her dress with two fingers, and sailing over the crossing; "hope you'll be lucky some time."</p> 
               <p>This little bit of spiteful, womanly advice, germinated in Mr. Russell's not over-bright mind, and he resolved, as far as he could, to act upon it.</p> 
               <p>Clara felt annoyed at his persistence in talking to her; but it never entered her brain that the awkward and unpolished foreman was presuming to put himself up as the rival of Harry Rushton. If she had been made to comprehend it, the contrast between Mr. Russell, in his paper cap and gold spectacles, with his very insignificant face, and his awkward figure, would have made her smile-evoking, as her imagination would have done, the bright image enshrined in her memory.</p> 
               <p>One day, Mary had been detained in the office by the late arrival of foreign mails, and being in want of some reference to another paper, she requested Clara to look over the files of the Daily Universe, kept in the printing office.</p> 
               <p>The printers were gone, but Mr. Russell still lingered, fidgetting about the office, resolved that never could he have such another opportunity for declaring his passion.</p> 
               <p>How to begin. He went opposite to Clara, and looked at her; she never raised her eyes. He stood by her side; she did not notice him. But now or never, thought Mr. Russell; and he looked at Clara as she bent over the huge file of newspapers. Her face was half hidden from his view; but the thick braids of her shining hair, gathered in mazes of plaits beneath the comb, so smooth, to the short ends that formed into small curls, which clustered round the back of the neck, so full and white; then the little tiny pink ear, just visible beneath the heavy braids above it.</p> 
               <p>All this Mr. Russell gazed on and admired, till, determined at once to bring matters to a crisis, he suddenly, with a desperation peculiar to timid men, leaned down and imprinted a fervent kiss on the back of Clara's neck.</p> 
               <p>Clara raised her head instantly-her eyes flashed with indignation, her nostrils dilated with anger, and her lips curled with scorn. She strove to speak, but her bosom heaved, and her heart beat so vehemently, her words could not find utterance. Now, Clara's glance of withering scorn, changed to one of distress and helplessness, and wandered round as seeking protection. Suddenly, the color faded from her cheek; a suppressed cry burst from her lips; with a bound she springs forward, and in an instant she is clasped in Harry Rushton's arms.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Russell, who had been overpowered at the effect of his bold stratagem, recovered his self-possession as soon as he saw Harry, and, with a sneer, exclaimed:</p> 
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7216-00000087"/> 
               <p>"You've a greater right nor I, if all things is true!"</p> 
               <p>"A right, you rude brute!" said Harry; "the right I have is to kick you out of the office."</p> 
               <p>"You've no right in it yourself, I take it," said Russell; "I wasn't doing nothing to you, if you had."</p> 
               <p>"You were insulting a woman I have a right to protect, for she is my affianced wife!"</p> 
               <p>Just at this juncture, Mary came forth from her room into the printing office, and beheld, to her amazement, Harry Rushton, with Clara clinging round him.</p> 
               <p>"Madam," said Harry, advancing towards Mary, "she has forgiven me. If you will pardon me too, before to-morrow's dawn she shall be my loved and honored wife. I cannot live without her."</p>

               <p>HE paced the room with heavy tread; his hands clasped behind him. She stood leaning against the window, and apparently gazing out into the street. Neither spoke. Once, when the sound of the footsteps ceased for an instant, she turned from the window and looked at him. He had paused at the other end of this long saloon, and, with his back towards her, leaned his forehead against the window-sill; and it seemed as though deep-drawn and suppressed sobs shook his muscular and stalwart frame.</p> 
               <p>She moved a step into the room, and then again she paused, and her eyes wandered round. The furniture was gone, excepting a few things, which were packed and enveloped in canvas coverings, ready to be taken<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7216-00000088"/> away. The carpets were rolled up, and in the middle of the room; the shutters were closed, all but the window where she stood; but that sufficiently revealed what this room had been-the splendid drawing-room of a magnificent abode. The golden cornices, the heavy chandeliers, and the mirrors, which still gleamed in the partial light, attested that fortune and luxury had presided in this room, so desolate, so dreary now. A tear gathered in her eyes, and she advanced two or three steps into the room. Gentle and hesitating as were her footsteps, the rustle of her silk dress reached his ear. Abruptly he raised his head, and resumed his silent march. If his tears had fallen, or if sobs had been torn from his heart, there were no traces now of either. His face, haughty in its habitual expression, was colder and haughtier now than ever; and his step, measured and equal, as though he trod the stage, on which he knew no rival; for it was the greatest artist of his country, who now was acting out in all the agonies of reality, the deepest, saddest of life's dramas-the severing of the closest ties-the ruin of a hearth and home.</p> 
               <p>As he came on, she quickly turned, and calmly resumed her first position-gazing with apparent unconcern from the window into the street. The tear that had gathered in her eyes had been driven back by her firm will; her aspect was calm; her cheek had its usual tint-nothing betrayed whether she was moved or not-for she, too, was an accomplished actress, but on life's stage. Yet she did feel-but not as he did; he had loved, he had been proud, vain, foolishly vain, of her; his home had been the aim of his life. And he was losing all, now, forever! He had doubts, too, of her truth; but they as yet floated but as vapors through his mind. His agony wanted but this, to goad him on to madness. She had not loved him, though she had been proud to be his wife-proud of his name; but her nature was incapable of the tender, devoted love implanted in his strong heart; and then she felt not for him the admiration and the esteem others lavished upon him; and when crowds applauded, and newspapers teemed with praise, her haughty lips would curl, and she would smile in contempt; for this demi-god, this strong and powerful giant, this genius of his age, had been deceived by a mere girl-had been blinded into wedding, into trusting, into worshiping a woman, who from the hour she saw him first, had played a game, had acted a part. He had given her position, riches, and renown. For some years their lives had been associated together; he had been the father of children who now were in their graves; and she felt a pang as she recalled all this, and wished, that the hour of trial<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7216-00000089"/> was over-but that was all. Other hopes were already springing in her heart-another life was revealing itself to her-another, in which she should be the star, the attraction-in which her name should, of itself, win fame and the world's applause, and not receive both, as belonging to him. She wished these last moments over; he counted each one as it passed, as the dying count the last moments of their lives. When in his walk he passed into the darkness of the other extremity of the long room, he would turn his head and gaze on her, as though trying to imprint each feature in his heart, that he might call it up before him, when she should be gone forever. Her face was half turned from him-the long lashes shaded the eyes, and the noble outline of the profile alone was visible. The fine-shaped head, Grecian in its contour, though too largely developed by its intellectual powers to have a strictly classical form-the massive throat, supported well the proud head; the magnificent figure was thrown out in all its full and fine proportions, as enveloped in the heavy folds of the black silk robe, it reclined against the white and gilded wainscot.</p> 
               <p>Never could her image have been impressed in a more favorable moment on his memory-only the beauties, none of the defects, were visible. That form, so fine in its proportions when in repose, was, when in motion, utterly devoid of grace. The face, so fine in profile, was harsh when seen in full; the eyes, spite of their being blue, and their habit of being constantly shaded by very long black lashes, were hard, and wanting in transparency and depth; and the brow, though high and expanded, did not bespeak either dignity or genius, and the lower part of the face had a tendency towards fullness, which gave it a sensual look, and threatened in later years to destroy its now oval proportions. Her hands were large, and but for constant care, would have been coarse; but they were shaded now, as she crossed them before her, in folds of lace. Her feet, too, like the hand, betrayed her want of high descent, either from the aristocracy of civilization, or the aristocracy of nature-which is formed of beings of noble, brave, and truthful natures, (such as hers was not,) and which displays itself in the same outward signs. But as she stood, so calm, so still, as we have first described her, she was an image to dwell in the mind of one who had loved her-and he <emph>had</emph> loved her, with the strength of his strong nature-could have loved her still-but that she had wounded, crushed, humiliated his pride, a passion strong as his love, and had scorned to confess her fault, or even by a look of appealing love, to plead for forgiveness.</p> 
               <p>For nearly a year had they lived under the same<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7216-00000090"/> roof, for nearly a year had their heads rested on the same pillow, in estrangement, in anger. He had hoped each day would bring her weeping, sorrowing, repentant, to his arms; she had not deemed he would have the courage to send her from him. And so, they had lived on; and now they were to part. He had decreed it-already were the rooms despoiled of all their familiar objects-and in a few days, strangers were to inhabit them. The servants were gone-they were alone; they were together; none were there to smile, to scoff, or to dissuade. But a few paces divided them; but one word was between them and eternal separation-but that word-it was she that must say it-she who loved not, she who was weary of shining by a borrowed light-she who, inspired by vanity and ambition, had carved out a brilliant destiny for herself-and therefore, she spoke not the word of peace, of reconciliation.</p> 
               <p>And now, in the street which, from its situation was habitually silent and unfrequented, the sound of a carriage, driving rapidly, was heard. Both hearts beat once more in unison-a few moments and it would be over-she would be freed from restraint, and he would be parted from her forever.</p> 
               <p>The carriage now drew up at the door, and the bell resounded, like a knell, through the large and empty hall. He stopped at the sound-she turned towards him; and in a voice from which she strove to banish all emotion, she said-</p> 
               <p>"Here is the carriage." As she uttered the words, she took her scarf from the pier table, where it lay, and put on her bonnet. He, with a last look at her, left the room. She watched him as he went, in the mirror before which she stood; and when the door closed on him, she turned and began to pace the room-pausing at different places, as though recalling some by-gone event. She gazed from the windows at the other end of the rooms, into the garden, where each flower, almost each leaf, was familiar, and connected with her past life. Then she heard his firm and heavy footsteps drawing near; and hastily she came to where he had left her, calm and unmoved.</p> 
               <p>"If you are ready, come!" said he. She bowed her head, and followed him down stairs. They reached the hall; the door is open, the carriage is there; the steps are down-the driver stands holding the door.</p> 
               <p>Her foot is on the threshold; it trembled and she almost paused. What if she were casting away greater honors than she could attain! Then her heart, perverted, but not yet corrupted, recalled the time she had first crossed this threshold, where it had been his pride to install her queen and mistress. She hesitated, and<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7216-00000091"/> her frame visibly trembled. But it was but for a moment. Though tears now streamed from her eyes, she moved on; and in an instant her fate is sealed-she has forever passed the sacred threshold of her home, and stands now alone, with nothing but a wreck of all a woman's life, around her.</p> 
               <p>He has followed her silently, with bursting heart; he just touches her as he assists her into the carriage; that touch thrills him-he half pronounces her name-but she has buried her face in her handkerchief. Still he hopes-he will give her a few moments' delay; he rushes back into the house, signing to the driver to stop; and in a few minutes returns with his portrait-the one that hung in the room where they had spent many happy hours.</p> 
               <p>"Caroline," said he, as he placed the portrait in the carriage, "will you like this?"</p> 
               <p>"Thank you!" faintly murmured the weeping wife, scarcely withdrawing her handkerchief from her eyes. She thought all was over now; but no! He springs into the carriage-he is by her side-and the carriage drives on.</p> 
               <p>It was a long drive. The carriage crossed the whole of the busy city-the whole length of Broadway, when the side-walks were filled with gay promenaders, and the street with dashing equipages.</p> 
                
               <p>Caroline, as he had called her, wept on. She dreaded if she spoke, that even now she might be drawn into a word of conciliation; and with the waywardness of her nature, though she had almost repented on the threshold of her home, now that she was away, now that he had almost appealed to her, she would not have gone back to her home and her monotonous life of virtue and respectability, for all the inducements his love could offer.</p> 
               <p>So they drove on; he gazing from the window of the carriage, she weeping in the corner. Mechanically he gazed from the window, his eyes recognizing each familiar object, and many familiar faces, but his heart absorbed on one thing alone. Soon it will be too late! Twice, he turned to look at her; but she has not altered her attitude. Still she weeps, but she moves not; and now the carriage has turned out of Broadway, into one of the cross streets, and has drawn up at a small house on the right.</p> 
               <p>It is over! His bosom heaves with a profound sigh; but he descends from the carriage, enters with her who is still his wife, and responds to the greeting of those who are waiting to receive him, with calmness and dignity.</p> 
               <p>The mistress of the house, whom Caroline called Louisa, as she embraced her, and whom he called Mrs.<pb n="188" xml:id="VAC7216-00000092"/> Field Close, is a thin, pale woman, still young, but whose delicacy of appearance partakes of suffering rather than refinement-appears to have a secret satisfaction in the temporary importance imparted to her in the present circumstance. She evidently thinks of performing her own part well, rather than of the solemnity of this interview.</p> 
               <p>After the first greetings, there is a pause. Caroline is seated on the sofa, one hand in that of Louisa; but she speaks not. There is a long silence, interrupted only by the noise made by the servants in the hall, unpacking the carriage. Presently the master of the house, a man with a shuffling gait, and untidy appearance, enters the room. He would have been handsome, had not his features, though each individually good, appeared as if not destined to be together-a fit emblem of his intellectual organization, which, though containing many elements of distinction, had always groveled in obscurity, from being constantly in opposition one with another. His principles, too, tended violently towards Socialism, as did his writings-for he was a writer of some renown; whilst his life was one of commonplace respectability, submitted to the scrutiny and control of his wife, and her extra-superfine and orthodox family.</p> 
               <p>He knew his own reasons, however, for his own
                  <pb n="(Illustration)-189" xml:id="VAC7216-00000093"/> 
                  <figure> 
                     <head>THE SEPARATION</head> 
                  </figure>
                   actions; but he considered the transactions now taking place in his own house, as a sort of well-played farce-for, to speak the truth, he was skeptical as to love, and thought men fools for interposing dignity and pride between themselves and their inclinations.</p> 
               <p>However, it was with as much solemnity as he could muster, that he now received his guest, lowering his voice, and trying to subdue the twinkle of fun in his eyes, and suppress the sarcastic smile on his lip.</p> 
               <p>He seated himself; and again there was another silence-till Louisa began, in her thin, sharp, nasal voice, to talk of her children, and her mother, and her household affairs-thinking thereby to display great tact.</p> 
               <p>Caroline blushed, for she felt that this spoiled the effectiveness of the scene; and her husband, on whom the voice grated like the hinge of some creaking door, abruptly started up in the midst of her speech, and extending his hand to her, said, in a voice of deep emotion, totally at variance with the unimportance of the words,</p> 
               <p>"Good morning, Mrs. Field Close-I leave Mrs. Oakwood in your care."</p> 
               <p>At these words, Caroline arose, but moved not. He crossed over to her, and held out his hand-she extended hers, and bent towards him. He stood erect before her, holding her hand.</p> 
               <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7216-00000094"/> 
               <p>"Edgar," said she, in a low voice; "they are looking at us!"</p> 
               <p>Edgar bent his head, and just touched her forehead with his lips-then letting go her hand, he turned away.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Field Close opened the door, and without another look, Oakwood passed out. Louisa went to the window-Caroline sunk on the sofa-Field and Oakwood were heard conversing in the hall; then the carriage door was closed with a bang; then the sound of the wheels was heard-and all was accomplished. He was gone-and so they, whom God, and man, and love, had joined together, were separated forever.</p>

               <p>CAROLINE, escorted by the self-satisfied and somewhat affected Mrs. Field Close, left the parlor, and retired to her own room.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Close, as she placed the light upon the dressing-table, cast an approving glance at the neat little room which was, during her visit in -- street, to be considered as Caroline's own room.</p> 
               <p>"This is a poor substitute for your magnificent chamber, Mrs. Oakwood," said she, in a tone which belied her words; "but, under the circumstances, it was better that you should accept an asylum with me rather than with any of your richer friends; for, you<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7216-00000095"/> know, in your position, respectability and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">caste</foreign> are the things you want, and I have determined to take you under my protection; so, I think, you will have nothing to dread from scandal; thank Heaven, I can defy it."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, dear Louisa, I feel this proof of friendship most deeply."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, it is a duty; and, you know, though the daughter of a poet, I have been taught that duties are to be performed before all else; and I'm sure my duties have been hard enough: my own delicate health, and my children continually sick, besides Field's peculiar tenets, which I have had so much trouble to subdue."</p> 
               <p>"I know, Louisa, all," replied Caroline, her voice and manner becoming more sympathizing, in proportion as she felt wearied with her hostess' speeches; "yes, Louisa, we all have our trials-mine," and Caroline, apparently exhausted by physical and mental emotions, reclined against the bookcase, near which she stood, and applied her handkerchief to her eyes.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Field Close took the hint, as it was intended she should, and languidly touching her friend's cheek, she prepared to take her leave.</p> 
               <p>"Good night," said she. "Oh, by the by, my mother will call on you to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"How good of her!" said Caroline; "how considerate!"</p> 
                
               <p>"My mother <emph>is</emph> a model, I do not deny that-once more, good night. I trust you will sleep; I hope the bed is as you like it," added Louisa, casting a look towards the bed, as if she meditated returning to examine it.</p> 
               <p>"Pray do not trouble yourself," hastily replied Caroline, holding the door open.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I saw to it myself-a poor man's wife, you know, is forced to be a good housekeeper: that is another of my duties I learned from my excellent mother. Once more, good night."</p> 
               <p>And this time, Mrs. Field Close really disappeared, and her steps were heard descending the stairs; while Caroline, closing the door and locking it, murmured to herself:</p> 
               <p>"What a tiresome woman! and what an ordeal of respectability have I got to go through! but then-"</p> 
               <p>Caroline, as she spoke, had walked across the room, and now stood before the long glass on the dressing-table, upon which Mrs. Close had placed the light. She paused in her reflections, as she caught sight of her own image, and sinking into a seat, she leaned her head upon her hand, and, gazing intently at herself, she fell into a deep train of thought.</p> 
               <p>On this day, which was a crisis in her fate-a beginning<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7216-00000096"/> ginning of a new life-all her past years came, one by one, before her.</p> 
               <p>Caroline Oakwood was an English woman by birth; she was the daughter of a popular singer, whose fine voice and great musical taste had raised him from the ranks of the army, to the position of the greatest English tenor of his day. But, though his talents had raised him to what is nominally called the position of a gentleman, they had not sufficed to give him either the education, or the habits of that class. He swore like a trooper, and drank like a grenadier; but, as he said, he spent his money like a gentleman-that is, he lavished it in extravagancies, and absurd liberalities, yet contrived to be always in debt with his tradesmen. He had, in the early part of his career, fascinated a young girl, who possessed a few thousand pounds in her own right, and had ran away with, and married her.</p> 
               <p>Her mother, a proud, prejudiced, and ignorant old Scotch woman, who prided herself, like all Scotch people, on her descent, had never forgiven this terrible <foreign xml:lang="FRA">msalliance;</foreign> though, having lost her second husband, she condescended to bring herself, and her ill-temper, under the roof of Cornelius St. Maur, her despised son-in-law, making poor Lucy's position, already far from a happy one, a most difficult one, between her mother and her husband.</p> 
                
               <p>Caroline's earliest recollections of the home of her childhood were, of the perpetual embarrassments of her mother for money for the family expenses; of harsh and dreaded visits from impatient creditors; of perpetual quarrels between her grandmother and her father. She remembered how she and her younger sisters, the offspring of this unhappy alliance, used to fear the sound of her father's voice; how they used to be huddled out of the way, that they might not see him intoxicated; and how they were often, her little sisters and herself, forced to remain at home for want of a frock or a bonnet, or even shoes, fit to go out in.</p> 
               <p>Sometimes, however, there would be a change in the sordid household: a larger house would be taken; the slatternly servants dismissed; the old frocks discarded; and something like a general appearance of order and respectability established. But this was only momentary; the creditors would again make their appearance; her mother would again be scolded by her grandmother, and her father begin again to drink and to swear.</p> 
               <p>As for the children, they brought themselves up; they scrambled through the perils of childhood. Their mother certainly loved them, and felt occasional remorse at her neglect of them; but the influence which<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7216-00000097"/> St. Maur had obtained over her, which had induced her to leave her home with him, still continued, and she devoted her life to him, bearing his hard words, his drunkenness, and his abuse, without a murmur.</p> 
               <p>The children, all girls, were left generally to their ill-tempered grandmother, who hated them, and to crafty, low, third-rate servant girls. They were sent, occasionally, for a quarter, to a second-rate day school, but oftener left to idleness and mischief at home.</p> 
               <p>Such were the days of childhood which Caroline, with a shudder, recalled.</p> 
               <p>Now she reached the age of fifteen. Suddenly, after some stormy debates between the family authorities, some entreaty on the part of her mother, and violent opposition from her grandmother, Caroline, in obedience to the emphatic fiat of her father, who swore the girl was "devilish handsome, and should be a lady," found herself transported to a fashionable boarding school, in Bedford Square.</p> 
               <p>It was a select school, such as then existed in London, but which now have almost entirely disappeared-the fashion of resident governesses having superseded them.</p> 
               <p>There were but twelve boarders, and of course no day scholars. There were the daughters of the Duke of Y--, there were the daughters of the Earl of S--, there was the sister of the young Sir Michel Stuart, the greatest landed proprietor in the Highlands. What condescension in Miss Roulette to receive Miss Caroline St. Maur in such an establishment, and in such society! What an advantage for Miss St. Maur, and how grateful she ought to be!</p> 
               <p>Caroline well remembered her impressions, as she found herself suddenly an inmate of a house furnished with every luxury-the abode of elegance, order, and peace; and contrasted it with the home she had called by that name all her life.</p> 
               <p>Caroline's intelligence was of the highest order; her feelings cold, her passions strong, her vanity intense, her ambition insatiate. Even at the age of fifteen, she formed the plan of her life, resolving never to descend to the sordid life from which she had emerged, and to sacrifice all to reach the summit of riches and honors.</p> 
               <p>How she soothed Lady Jane! how she flattered Lady Mary! how she toadied Miss Roulette! and how, when she heard that Miss Stuart was an orphan and an heiress, and above all, had a brother possessed of twenty thousand a year, she ingratiated herself with her, and appearing by turns all things to all, became the favorite of the school!</p> 
               <p>She studied seriously, too, for she felt that all would<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7216-00000098"/> help her in the two great objects of her life, power and pleasure. Miss Roulette, and all the masters, were proud of her, and she was put into the foremost ranks on all public occasions of display.</p> 
               <p>Then, too, sweet Ellen Stuart loved her, and her brother, Sir Michel, had asked to see the friend so kind to his delicate and tender-hearted sister. How, after their first interviews, during his visits to his sister, had Sir Michel written in his letters of nothing but the beautiful Caroline! till at last, after a most honorable courtship, carried on somewhat by stealth, he had solemnly pledged her his faith.</p> 
               <p>Here Caroline paused and sighed; for here she had committed the first error of her life.</p> 
               <p>It happened that about this time, a ball had been given by Miss Roulette, in honor of some Lady Anne or Lady Mary's leaving; and as the young ladies under her charge were not intended for the seclusion of the cloister, but, on the contrary, destined to the world, many young lordlings were invited, as well as many distinguished men of fashion and genius.</p> 
               <p>Caroline, the handsomest of all the girls present, the most dignified in manner, with really an air of distinction about her, attracted universal attention-of which she apparently was totally unconscious, but which she watched with intense curiosity and interest.</p> 
                
               <p>"By Jove, that's a devilish fine girl!" said the Duke of S-- to Harvey Raymond, the fashionable author and dramatist of the day; "who is she?"</p> 
               <p>"Miss Caroline St. Maur," replied Harvey.</p> 
               <p>"What, a relation of the Somersets?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh no, a daughter of the tenor, St. Maur."</p> 
               <p>"Oh!" said the Duke, dropping his eye-glass, and turning away; "what a pity!"</p> 
               <p>All this Caroline had overheard, and she vowed to herself that she would be somebody whom no Duke should dare to pity! She longed for the time she should be Lady Stuart, and turned tenderly her eyes in search of Sir Michel. But instead of encountering his eyes, she encountered the admiring gaze of Harvey Raymond; and here, as throughout all her career, the two strong elements of her character were placed in opposition. Her vanity interfered with her ambition! All her energies were bent upon becoming Lady Stuart; but her woman's vanity would not allow her to pass by so well-known an admirer of the fair sex, a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rou</foreign> of fashion, like Harvey Raymond, without striving to bring him to her feet.</p> 
               <p>Harvey was easily caught. That is, he was easily induced to enter into a flirtation with a girl worthy the trouble, and to allow himself to be made love to-to indulge himself occasionally in the excitement of a passion<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7216-00000099"/> sion. It varied his monotonous life. But he never fell in love; he was as incapable of sentiment and romance as Caroline herself.</p> 
               <p>So they coquetted-for men coquet in the onset of a conquest, as well as women; until Caroline's vanity and his own almost assumed the semblance of passion. Caroline was determined to make him desperately in love, and he was amused to watch the manuvres of such consummate art in one so young; for though he pretended to be deceived, he was not, and read Caroline's real character as clearly as though she had been the heroine of one of his own books.</p> 
               <p>But spite of her cleverness, Caroline was young and inexperienced, and Harvey was the reverse-therefore, though he allowed her to think she had achieved a conquest, he exacted sacrifices which Caroline had never dreamed of making, and of which she repented when too late.</p> 
               <p>Too late to retreat, we mean; for the fact of her having yielded to the arts of a libertine, whom she herself was trying to inthrall, did not, as it would most other girls, throw her into a state of despondency or despair. Even Harvey was amazed at her self-possession; for when, at their next meeting, he was prepared for tears and supplications, and expected to be asked to marry his victim, he found her perfectly cold, reserved served and collected; and instead of entreating him to marry her, she forestalled his refusal, by declaring that nothing should induce her to become his wife, and that therefore he need not ask her.</p> 
               <p>"All I ask is secresy," said Caroline, "for I am engaged to another."</p> 
               <p>"Engaged! why you certainly made the first advances to me, Caroline."</p> 
               <p>"Do you think so?" said Caroline, smiling, calmly. "I cannot remember; but if I did, it is but just that I should also be the first to propose that we should part. All I ask is, that we part as friends and as allies, and that we keep each others' counsel."</p> 
               <p>Now, strange to say, Harvey was irritated at this coolness, and never felt nearer being in love with Caroline in his life, than when she took leave of him.</p> 
               <p>He watched with curiosity her future career; and though he was too much a man of the world to show any pique, he never forgave her.</p> 
               <p>Caroline, after this first gratification of her vanity, gave herself for a time entirely to her ambitious views. Gentle, devoted, tender, full of generous impulses, she charmed Sir Michel-for to him she was all this; till at length, when she reached the age of seventeen, he opened his suit to her father, and the engagement was but too gladly ratified by the whole family.</p> 
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7216-00000100"/> 
               <p>Though not publicly announced-indeed, they moved in such different spheres, that an announcement was unnecessary-the engagement was soon whispered around. St. Maur himself boasted of it every where-and so it reached Harvey Raymond's ears.</p> 
               <p>Then came his revenge. Making it a point of honor with Sir Michel, with whom he was personally acquainted, he revealed to him his intrigue with Caroline; and the young baronet, shocked and astonished, broke off his engagement, having the delicacy to take all the blame upon himself, and repairing to the continent, he strove to forget Caroline, whom he had deeply loved.</p> 
               <p>Thus were her ambitious views thwarted on the very eve of their consummation; and Caroline was forced, beautiful, brilliant, and accomplished, accustomed to every luxury and refinement, to return to her sordid home.</p> 
               <p>How its humiliations maddened her, how its privations galled her, how she despised all around her, none but herself could tell. Such was her home, such her father's habits, that she dared not ask any of her former friends to visit her; so she lost all chance of ever emerging from the class from which she had sprung, and to which, after a short and intoxicating flight, she had now returned.</p> 
                
               <p>Her father, who was proud of his handsome daughter, sometimes brought a friend from the theatre to admire her; but Caroline disdained his friends, and scorned their admiration. She was not yet eighteen; and, though she hated her present position, she resolved to wait and watch, for she had determined to realize the ambition of her life-distinction and power.</p> 
               <p>At length, one evening her father, who had sung at one of the Ancient Concerts, and returned early, in the sober condition befitting these orthodox assemblies, sent to desire Caroline to come down to supper with him, and the friend he had brought.</p> 
               <p>"Such a handsome man, Carry!" said her younger sister, Susan; "and with such a voice! I don't mean a singing voice," added she, laughing, as Caroline turned away in contempt; "but a speaking voice-so deep and tender, I don't wonder he is a celebrity."</p> 
               <p>"Who is it, child?" said Carry, smoothing her hair.</p> 
               <p>"Why, the great actor, Oakwood; about whom all London is raving."</p> 
               <p>Caroline blushed with pleasure. At length there was a conquest worthy of her. She had given up all idea of accomplishing an alliance, such as she had once hoped would have placed her in the ranks of the British aristocracy; and next to the aristocracy of descent,<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7216-00000101"/> came the aristocracy of talent and riches, such as she knew the young tragedian would achieve.</p> 
               <p>He was not a man of the world. She had heard of him as impulsive, generous, and devoted to his art. In the few minutes which intervened between her being summoned and her appearance in the parlor, Caroline had decided that she would become the wife of Edgar Oakwood, and achieve in the new world the position she had failed to attain in the old.</p> 
               <p>Caroline's manners varied according to the society she was in; like all artful women, she studied to discover the weaknesses and defects of those over whom she desired to exercise an influence. No sooner had she seen Edgar, than his handsome and imposing appearance converted into a positive determination the vague plan she had formed on descending the stairs.</p> 
               <p>It required but a few moments for Caroline to decide on the character most likely to charm the openhearted, somewhat abrupt, but susceptible and proud young artist; and that character she assumed. She became the quiet, devoted, reserved young girl, inviting protection and love. Her eyes were raised to his with timid admiration, then fell modestly beneath his gaze. She listened to him as one entranced; and when she spoke, she displayed such a thorough appreciation of his genius, such knowledge of art, such keen and observant servant intellect, that Edgar, who never till now had been in the society of a highly educated woman, was both astonished and charmed. Then, this bright creature, so beautiful and gifted, was so unobtrusive and quiet, so affectionate, so devoted to her duties, so free from all frivolity and vanity-would be so thoroughly dependent on the man she loved for happiness-would never look beyond her home for happiness. She was the wife his heart desired; she was the wife he would be proud to take with him across the broad Atlantic; she was the wife with whom he would share the riches and the fame, he knew he would achieve.</p> 
               <p>And so they were married; for Caroline was the better actor of the two. Though Edgar could, on the mimic stage, obtain the applause of assembled multitudes, she, by her consummate art, could deceive even in the intimacy of every day life; and, through years and years living under the same roof, could "assume a virtue though she had it not."</p> 
               <p>But Caroline, though she had been right in divining the character calculated to win Edgar's love, had overrated her own powers, in thinking she could gain an ascendency over him after marriage. He loved her, he denied her nothing, he confided in her, he was proud of her; but she found that the character of the submissive, devoted wife must be her real one-her only<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7216-00000102"/> chance of happiness was to keep within its limits. She had persuaded Edgar of her unbounded love for him; and he, believing it, forced her to keep up the deceit. Her dreams of becoming a leader in society, in fashion, of drawing around her an admiring circle, of becoming renowned for her beauty and accomplishments, were soon dispelled. She was nothing but the great Edgar Oakwood's wife-from that fact arose her only distinction.</p> 
               <p>Now, had she loved Edgar, she would have wanted no other; and the almost splendor in which she lived, contrasted with the almost squalor of her early years, should have made her contented with her lot-a lot most women would have deemed a happy one. But Caroline did not love Edgar; and when he (unknown to himself) disappointed the hopes she had formed, a feeling of hatred, mixed with fear, sprung up in her heart.</p> 
               <p>Then, to gratify the cravings of her vanity-to vary the stupid monotony of her life, she began to deceive him, and engaged in intrigues with the few who came in her way.</p> 
               <p>She had traveled with him in Spain; and there, as Caroline sat this eventful night, she recalled the wild passion of the young Spaniard, who had been their companion, and who so often, when Edgar slept in the carriage, as they pursued their journeyings at night, had poured forth the fervent protestations of his love. She smiled, too, to think that probably her lover, when he thought of her, imagined her plunged in eternal despair or regret.</p> 
               <p>Then, amongst many, her memory evoked the gay and renowned Lord C-, who had been smitten with the handsome wife of the American tragedian, while by chance he was staying at the same inn, in one of the large towns of Ireland. She was rather proud of this conquest; for Lord C-was renowned for his taste, and for some years had been the favored lover of the most beautiful woman on the opera stage-<foreign xml:lang="ITA">La Diva.</foreign>
               </p> 
               <p>Then there was the eccentric child of genius, whose musical talents had attracted her fancy, together with his handsome person and his romantic history. She had even helped him in his career, from the ample purse at her command; and now, he avoided her, and when he spoke of her, called her a "dangerous woman."</p> 
               <p>But this she cared not for. Caroline was incapable of indignation; she believed not in affection, or truth, or devotion, or self-sacrifice. All virtue was to her seeming-the only motive she knew was expediency. Nothing was essential to her happiness, excepting her<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7216-00000103"/> self-exaltation; so that her inordinate vanity led her to forget and excuse, rather than resent neglect, and thus admit she had been neglected.</p> 
               <p>There passed before her in the magic lantern of her thoughts, many who had been but transient worshipers.</p> 
               <lg type="quotation"> 
                  <l>"What has not fired her bosom or her brain?</l> 
                  <l rend="ti-1">Csar and Tallboy, Charles or Charlemagne!"</l> 
               </lg> 
               <p>But none had known these passing fancies; she herself had, even to the individuals themselves, appeared to have forgotten them, and they were too much in awe of Oakwood's ire, supported as it was by extraordinary physical strength, ever to betray her.</p> 
               <p>But there had come a time, when the flattery of friends whom she continued to draw around her by stealth, during the not unfrequent absence of her husband, and her own weariness of her mode of life, had made her determine to change it. She had now reached the age at which the passions acquire their full development, and the will and the faculties their full power. She laid her plans deeply, resolved to break away from the influence which overshadowed her, and shine forth a luminary of herself, the world at her feet, and all men sounding her praises.</p> 
               <p>So she fermented the storm, which had been long gathering in her house; and so at last she had arrived at the catastrophe which had severed her from her husband and her home. "Poor thing!" said a pitying world. "At last I am free!" said Caroline, as, rising from her long retrospection, she began to undress.</p> 
               <p>"And I must achieve all that remains through <emph>respectability</emph> and women-that is the idol of this country, and I have studied it for ten years, and know, it," said Caroline, smiling and admiring herself, as each garment she threw off revealed the charms of her voluptuous beauty, then in its full meridian.</p> 
               <p>"Forgive, oh goddess of these climes!" said she, laughingly, twisting up her hair, "if when I worship thee, I listen to those who worship beauty, such as," added she, taking a last look at her full bust and shoulders, "thou, lean goddess, art rarely called on to patronize!"</p> 
               <p>And so she laid her head on her pillow, and extinguishing the light, dreamed not of him whose head had for so many years rested by hers, and who now, on his solitary couch, reverted in sleepless agony to the days, when she who had left him forever, was a young and loving bride. But <emph>she</emph> dreamed that she stood on an open balcony, and that multitudes, in the thronged streets below, shouted with enthusiasm as she appeared, proclaiming her the most virtuous and the loveliest of women!</p>

               <p>MRS. FIELD CLOSE, and all the immaculate and orthodox set to which she belonged, were not the only allies on whom Caroline Oakwood depended for justifying herself to the world, and for working out of the critical position in which she had placed herself. Power and distinction are difficult things to accomplish when a woman throws off the chains of marriage.</p> 
               <p>She had, many years before, encountered, in a visit she had made since her marriage to her native country, a man whose decided talents had first obtained for him the reputation they merited. His conduct had afterwards changed that fame into notoriety; his follies, extravagancies and fopperies had, on his return from a tour in Europe, and the publication of a book replete with scandal, fixed the attention of his native city upon him. A certain refinement of manner, an agreeable personal appearance, together with the most exquisite tact in the art of flattery, had ingratiated our author with the sex, whose heart is open as day to melting <emph>flattery,</emph> and made him for sometime the fashion. Well had he profited by this transient favor of the "upper ten," as he christened the aspiring population, whose magnificence displayed in free-stone palaces, knew not how to dissipate the riches and the ennui which stepped so noiselessly over those tapestry carpets, and sat perpetually by their side, on their velvet and brocaded sofas.</p> 
               <p>Now, Mr. Bazaleel Wagstaff Bayes, had scarcely any advocates, excepting amongst the ladies; and they still fought his battles, praised him, courted him, and upheld by their patronage and subscriptions, his weekly journal, called the "Fireside Gazette." On this were all his literary energies now concentrated; and by the grave and diplomatic manner in which it related the frivolous sayings and doings of the class he toadied,<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7216-00000105"/> converting its follies into refinements, its inconsistencies into beautiful <emph>idiosyncrasies,</emph> its charitable displays at calico and fancy balls into heroic actions, this "Gazette" had (though journalism scornfully denied it, looking on it much as a lion does on a butterfly,) a certain influence in a certain set, and undoubtedly a wide-extended influence in the country towns, where B. W. Bayes and the "Fireside Gazette" were considered as the guides to fashion and refinement. The "Fireside Gazette" addressed its honeyed and harmless pages entirely to mediocrity-a class which, if neither gods nor men allow, women are very fond of both permitting and patronizing. Therefore, was it an important point with Mrs. Oakwood to secure the influence she knew she could, at one time, have commanded. Accordingly, a few days after her taking up her residence with Mrs. Field Close, Mrs. Oakwood repaired, at about three o'clock, to a handsome house in the same street, and ringing at the door, was instantly admitted by a shining, smiling black servant.</p> 
               <p>"Missus is up stairs, ma'rm, a dressing for dinner," said the servant.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you," replied Caroline, going up stairs; "I shall find her."</p> 
               <p>At the top of the stairs, Caroline was met by a little woman in a muslin dressing-gown, who rushing up to her, clasped her with silent effusion to her bosom, and then led her into the room, and seating her on the sofa, took her place beside her, and exclaiming with a deep sigh,</p> 
               <p>"Poor Caroline!" burst into tears.</p> 
               <p>The adroit Caroline, taking her cue from this outburst of feeling, immediately buried her face in her handkerchief, and pressing the hand of her friend, she, between two deep sobs, murmured:</p> 
               <p>"Zephalinda!" for such was the name in which Mrs. Bazaleel Wagstaff Bayes rejoiced.</p> 
               <p>Here must we pause to describe this-the second wife of the Editor of the "Fireside Gazette."</p> 
               <p>She was the adopted daughter of one of the great merchant princes, and had been thought to have perpetrated a terrible <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mssalliance</foreign> by her recent marriage with the poet whose name she now bore-for merchant princes set very little value upon poetry, and besides, her adopted parents belonged to the strictly moral and respectable set, a set which eschewed all knowledge of the Fireside Gazette and of B. W. Bayes.</p> 
               <p>Zephalinda Bayes had great common sense, no mean capacities, good temper-in fact, every quality which make an estimable woman; but all these qualities were marred by the one predominant defect of her character-vanity. That had mainly contributed to<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7216-00000106"/> her marriage with the poet, who had, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">par parenthese,</foreign> married her for the connection, which silently eschewed him, and her fortune, which turned out to be twelve hundred dollars a year.</p> 
               <p>Zephalinda, or Zephy, as she loved to be called, had but one desire-that was to be a pretty woman; and that of all ambitions was the most unfortunate, because it was one impossible to gratify-for nature had denied her the first elements. She was even obliged, with the profoundest regret, to admit to herself that she was not pretty; that not even the fact of Bayes, who was renowned for his fastidious taste, having married her, could persuade the world into thinking her beautiful. So she took to being interesting-"a dear little thing men felt they ought to protect"-and put on childish and helpless airs, aspiring at the same time to a reputation for strength of character, and a mind above the vulgar passions of mediocrity.</p> 
               <p>It was in pursuance of this her plan of conduct, that Mrs. Bayes, in the present juncture of Caroline's affairs, resolved on overshadowing her with her protection. Rumor had accused her husband of a profound admiration for Mrs. Oakwood, and the world, one and all, declared Mrs. Oakwood to be a very handsome woman. Here was an opportunity for displaying her great superiority over the littlenesses of the world. She was incapable of jealousy, she was unlike the rest of her sex, ready to trample down a woman-no! she was one of the few examples of a true and devoted friendship! So, beginning by frankly admitting "Mrs. Oakwood was very handsome to those who admired any one so large," she every where proclaimed her persuasion of poor Caroline's deep injuries, and her determination to support her.</p> 
               <p>After the first paroxysm of emotion had subsided, Mrs. Bayes, who was the first to recover herself-for Caroline, of course, waited for the signal to get calm, said:</p> 
               <p>"Have you seen Bayes, dear Carry?"</p> 
               <p>"Not yet, not yet; I have seen no one, dear Zephy; I required a few days to recover myself."</p> 
               <p>"Ay, but you are wrong, however; go and see Bayes-he is up stairs-but first, take off your bonnet, for you must stay and dine with us."</p> 
               <p>"Are you alone?"</p> 
               <p>"No, not alone; but-"</p> 
               <p>"Oh then, indeed, I cannot," said Caroline, pausing in her operation of taking off her bonnet; "my feelings-"</p> 
               <p>"You must overcome your feelings, dearest-you know you have friends-"</p> 
               <p>"I know, I know," said Caroline, and apparently<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7216-00000107"/> resigned to submit to her friends, she took off her bonnet, and nodding to "Zephy," went up to the floor above, where was situated the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">sanctum</foreign> of the Editor of the "Fireside Gazette."</p> 
               <p>The sanctum of the refined and elegant Bayes, was a very different retreat to what, probably, his numerous admirers fancied it. In his neat and elegant abode, it was the only untidy place. A very shabby carpet was spread upon the floor, which, however, was almost entirely covered with an accumulation of old newpsapers, pamphlets and books. A little iron bedstead, on which was one mattress, covered by a not over-clean blanket, occupied one side of the room-boots of every description stood about the floor; coats and pantaloons of every pattern hung against the wall, occasionally half obscuring the beauties of some lithographed celebrity, which was pinned against it.</p> 
               <p>On a table in the centre, a large common deal-table, were, first, the whole toilet service in very pretty china; and as the editor never allowed his lucubrations to be interrupted by a housemaid, each object testified that that morning the various pitchers and basins had been called into active service. Then, surrounding these articles, which rose like giants from among them, were uncountable numbers of bottles containing pomatums, perfumes, cosmetics, paints, bandolines, whisker-dyes, moustachio-colorers, tooth-powders, and soaps-whose names and qualities it is useless to record, for are they not all written in the advertising columns of the Fireside Gazette?</p> 
               <p>At an old-fashioned writing-table sat the celebrated Bayes-his feet thrust into well-worn slippers, his long, lean limbs clothed in pantaloons, which for want of the sustaining braces, were "a world too wide;" and over a crumpled and soiled shirt, he wore a striped blue and white woven jacket-an artistic caprice. His features were careworn, and his whole aspect was one of exhaustion and ill-health, though there still was fire in his small blue eye, and youth still lingered in the unbrushed mazes of his bright brown hair.</p> 
               <p>Carry, on her entrance, having closed the door, went straight up to the editor, who raising his eyes as she entered, threw himself back in his chair, exclaiming,</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Carry!" and stooping down, she imprinted a kiss upon his forehead.</p> 
               <p>He then took hold of both her hands, and drawing his chair a little away from her, scanned her narrowly, as she stood before him.</p> 
               <p>"And so," said he, "my queen, we are free at last? No longer the victim of the ogre. And now to work our fortune-Carry-for such a magnificent creature<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7216-00000108"/> as you are, ought to make a noise in the world-and shall! We'll manage it for you, fair lady! I have already laid our plans. Sit down and hear them; but first, for I am exhausted, give me a glass of ale you will find there on the table."</p> 
               <p>Caroline, having from the chaos of bottles, disinterred the small green ale bottle, and poured its contents into a glass, handed it to the editor, who gallantly bidding her to put her lips to it first, took it and swallowed it at a draught.</p> 
               <p>Caroline seated herself, and Bayes, setting down the glass, exclaimed,</p> 
               <p>"That goes to the exhausted spot! Now then, Carry, lady-bird, what do you mean to do?"</p> 
               <p>"I want you to tell me how to proceed."</p> 
               <p>"You have but one way, my lady-that is, to gain the sympathies of the public. That is to be done by persuading them that you are the most virtuous, the most injured, and the most helpless of women. The woman dodge is the thing, after all. You know we Americans pride ourselves on our knight-errantry to woman. This is the feeling you must work on-for you know the other party, our adversary, is mighty powerful in a certain quarter.</p> 
               <p>"You must live in retirement, yet contrive to see every body that's of any use. You must dress simply, but always becomingly. Your manners must be very quiet, but if you get into a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tte--tte,</foreign> be as fascinating as you please-only you know, Carry, don't go too far-for men are treacherous beings; I wouldn't trust them, but make them as much in love with you as you can. You can and must always wind off too dangerous an encounter, by a sudden burst of love for the cruel husband you still adore-whom nothing can make you forget-no, never! and turn up your eyes just so-and you will be irresistible. Then these men will spread wide the fame of your virtue. Then we must have the Press with us. We have no money, so we must work every journal by its ruling passion. They have all a pet hatred, and a pet plan, and a pet love-I'll guide you here. To-day you will meet an editor of an influential evening paper here. I recommended him to you-he is a noble-hearted, generous, romantic, impulsive fellow, and has a beautiful wife. Make up to her, Carry, for women are essential to us. Cultivate the "Zephy" below, too; she is our main stay, and you need have no remorse-though I don't think you're troubled with much; for she intends to rise to celebrity on your shoulders, and is dying to come before the public."</p> 
               <p>"And what are we ultimately to do?"</p> 
               <p>"Ultimately to do! Why, get a divorce to be sure,<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7216-00000109"/> and a splendid allowance, and that, added to our reputation of the most injured and virtuous woman, will give us fame and freedom over the whole world. Then I would advise you to go to Paris, though you don't speak French well enough."</p> 
               <p>"Never mind that, now," said Carry, interrupting him, for she hated to be reminded that there were things she couldn't do-"let the future provide for itself. I suppose I must stay a little longer with these old fogey Field Closes? The mother trotted up from the country to-day to see me. Oh, what bores they all are!"</p> 
               <p>"Nice people," said Bayes, smiling, "exactly what we want; stick to them. Then I think you might come here-yes, just let it be so-you can come every day, for an hour or two, you know, even now."</p> 
               <p>As he spoke, Bayes rose, and going up to Caroline, passed both his hands over the smooth braids of her hair, as she still sat, lost in thought.</p> 
               <p>At this moment, the door opened, and Bayes moved quickly away, just as a beautiful cherub face, surrounded by masses of radiant curls, smilingly peeped in.</p> 
               <p>"May I come in, papa?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my darling," said Bayes, the expression of his face changing from superciliousness to one of deep and profound tenderness-"yes, my darling, my own little pet, come in always."</p> 
               <p>A beautiful child of about seven years, made but one bound from the door to her father's arms-then, having embraced him, she perceived Caroline, and smilingly held up her lips to be kissed.</p> 
               <p>Caroline kissed her with affection.</p> 
               <p>"Papa," said the child, "Mrs. Bayes--"</p> 
               <p>"Mamma, you mean, Fidelia," interrupted her father.</p> 
               <p>"Mamma," repeated the child, with an effort, "says it is almost dinner-time, and she says she is ready, and you won't be, (you never are, you know, naughty pap!) and she says the people you invited are down stairs. I saw them-oh, the lady is so beautiful, so beautiful!"</p> 
               <p>"Go away with you, then, both of you," said Bayes. "I must dress. Tell them to put back the dinner-I shall be ready in ten minutes."</p> 
               <p>"In six times ten," said Carry, as she left the room.</p> 
               <p>"That makes sixty," said Fidelia, "and sixty minutes make an hour-Papa never can dress in an hour."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps he will to-day, darling. Now come down with me, and mind, Fidelia dear, you call Mrs. Bayes<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7216-00000110"/> 'mamma'-you know she is your papa's wife, and she likes you to say mamma, before strangers."</p> 
               <p>"But she isn't my real mamma, is she, Mrs. Oakwood?"</p> 
               <p>"No, darling, your mamma is in heaven," replied Carry, remembering the guardian angel of Bayes, his first wife, who had fled from earth in the pride of her youth and beauty.</p> 
               <p>And with a pensive smile, holding the fair Fidelia by the hand, Caroline pushed aside the curtains which draped the doors of Bayes' parlor, and entered the room.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Bayes was sitting on a small low chair, her usual seat; it was graceful and infantile-and on the sofa by her side, sat a gentleman in animated conversation. He raised his sparkling eyes to Caroline, as she entered, and they became still brighter as, with evident admiration, he gazed on her.</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Oakwood," said Mrs. Bayes, introducing her friend, "Mr. Harry Rushton;" then looking round, inquiringly, she said, "Where is Mrs. Rushton?"</p> 
               <p>"Clara," said Mr. Rushton; and a lady, who had been looking at the books which in carved-oak bookcases lined the room, advanced towards the group. "Clara," said Mr. Rushton, "Mrs. Bayes desires to introduce you to her friend."</p> 
                
               <p>"Mrs. Oakwood," said Mrs. Bayes, fulfilling her duties as hostess, "Mrs. Harry Rushton"-then she renewed her conversation with Mr. Rushton, and Caroline and Clara sat down on the opposite sofa, side-by-side.</p>

               <p>RUSHTON and Clara had been married some three years.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Edwards' and Mary had returned to Europe. Mr. Edwards' partner had gone to Australia with his ill-gotten wealth; there he had prospered, and in the very height of his prosperity, there he died.</p> 
               <p>On his death-bed, the utter vanity and uselessness of his crimes, had come before him; his memory could recall no happiness, to which, in spite of his wealth, they had contributed. The only pure and happy feelings to which he could recur, were those he had felt for Mary-the only expiation in his power was to restore to those he had robbed, his fraudulently obtained riches. With this one act of generosity and repentance, he hoped to appear before the Eternal Tribunal which awaited him, with sufficient to outweigh in the balance all that made him dread the judgment hour. Pouring his remorse into the bosom of a pious minister, summoned with the physician by his side, a lawyer was sent for in all haste, and there the sums abstracted from Mr. Edwards were restored, with compound interest-<emph>that</emph> was rigidly exacted by the pious minister. But the enormous wealth of the dying sinner, having left a large balance, it was deemed a proper continuance of expiation, that the remainder should be deposited in the hands of his spiritual adviser, for the building of a church.</p> 
               <p>All things being thus satisfactorily settled-surrounded by the cold, phlegmatic faces of law, physic, and divinity, the three attendants on death-beds, where no love watches-Mary's recreant lover died and was buried, and a marble monument raised to his memory, recording his good deeds-namely, his riches; and his piety-namely, his donation for the building of a church.</p> 
               <p>And so Mary and her father became rich again; and so they returned to Europe; for there was not a<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7216-00000112"/> single tie, beyond Clara, to bind them to the city of Brotherly Love, where they had not encountered a friendly glance or a kindly pressure of the hand.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Edwards delighted at the thought of seeing England once more, particularly as his great work on emigration was very nearly completed, and that it would benefit the world at large much more if published in the country from which people emigrated, instead of the country to which they emigrated-an observation which emanated from Rushton, for whom Edwards had a most profound admiration, and which made Mr. Edwards think the restoration of his fortune quite providential.</p> 
               <p>Mary, whose early disappointments had never been banished by any consolations, compared with the monotonous and gloomy years of trial and penury which had intervened-these very remembrances of her early love, misplaced as it had been, and found that they still were amongst the most precious of her life. She was deeply moved at the thought of revisiting the scenes where her youth had been passed-of returning to her own people, and to her own habits and associations. She felt too happy that the man, who once had been her ideal of all that was virtuous and noble, had reinstated himself, in her esteem, and inwardly resolved to dedicate the fortune thus given into her hands, to noble and holy purposes.</p> 
                
               <p>But to part with Clara-that was a hard struggle, indeed. Happily as they had lived together under the same roof for the last two years-much as she had learned to love Rushton, she began to regret the marriage, and to look on him with reproach, as on the evening preceding her departure, she sat in their little parlor with her arms round Clara.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, if you could have gone with me, my child!-but to leave you alone!"</p> 
               <p>"Alone, Mary?-oh, no! But still it is cruel, cruel to part; but Harry will bring me over to you. You know he is going to be a great journalist and a great politician."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks to you, Mary," said Harry, coming and kneeling before his wife and her adopted mother, and taking a hand of each; "thanks to you, Mary, who, not content with giving me this greatest treasure, my own, my beautiful, have bestowed on us, what will enable me to grasp at once that position I might for years have struggled to achieve. A leading journalist in New York, with the reputation I already possess, "will soon lead me to a leading position in the political world; and then-I will ask for a foreign appointment-and then-"</p> 
               <p>Mary, smilingly, put her hand before Rushton's mouth.</p> 
               <pb n="228 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7216-00000113"/> 
               <p>"And then, I suppose, you will be sent as minister to England! Oh, Harry, dear!" added Mary, changing her manner, until she spoke in a grave, solemn tone; "do not grow too ambitious. And, my dear ones, remember this hour, when we are far away; remember, Harry, that my Clara has no one in this world-for I am, literally, even going out of her world-but you. Remember, Harry, I once solemnly gave her to you, and then you became her husband. Now again, I solemnly confide her to you; become her friend, her counsellor, her protector. Use her gently, kindly-be indulgent to her, and love her wholly and faithfully,-for she will have none to love her but God, who will watch over her, for she is one of his angels, and you, Harry, are her god upon earth."</p> 
               <p>"Mary," exclaimed Harry, his sensitive feelings deeply moved; "kneeling at your feet in her presence, I renew my marriage vow, and I swear to be to her, not only a lover and a husband, but all you, the tenderest of sisters and of mothers, have been to her. Go over the deep waters, to your peaceful home. Mary; never let one care for her fate disturb you-I live but for her, breathe but for her-she is my life. Until I loved her, the world and my existence were aimless-I, too, was alone; but having her, I miss no kindred-she is all to me, as I will be all to her forever."</p>

               <p>And so they had parted-with many tears and many sobs, with oft-repeated embraces, till the fair ship heaved its anchor, and Mary sailed for the Old World.</p> 
               <p>There they stood, side-by-side, on the shores of what the moderns have called the New World-shores as old as theirs, on which the broad waves had silently dashed for centuries-where springs and autumns bloomed and faded-where the wild forests had stretched their branches in luxuriance, unchecked by man, for ages and ages, whilst the Old World was, through struggles, superstitions, war, and bloodshed, accumulating annals of crime and misery, which now have driven her children, haggard and famishing, to this New World. Here now, in crowded ports, wave, from high masts, banners of every nation-on these broad shores now rise the proud habitations of wealth, and in her broad streets-banishing the primeval forests-civilization too has brought toil, sorrow, pain, and crime.</p> 
               <p>And there they stood, these two, who in two hemispheres, cared but for each other; and they watched, till lost in the horizon of light, the ship which bore Mary to her home, vanished from their sight; and, turning slowly, her hands clasped round his arm, Clara silently, with faltering step, regained her home,<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7216-00000115"/> -the home Mary's love and bounty had delighted to create and embellish for them before she left.</p> 
               <p>Anxious to insure Clara's position, Mary had given Harry Rushton the funds to purchase the half of an evening paper, which wanted but his talents and popularity to give it a wide circulation. He had now been its editor for more than a year, and had given it such an impetus, as to make it an influential organ of public opinion, and a most desirable ally, as Mr. B. W. Bayes had said, for any one courting the favor of the public, through that most reliable of all sources, the public press.</p> 
               <p>Now, although Rushton's wit and talents, his handsome person, and a certain geniality of manner, which, though lacking the polish of the world, was full of instructive refinement, made him the most popular editor in the city-it must be confessed that the extreme beauty of his wife had contributed to make him become,-what he was in his own circle-the fashion.</p> 
               <p>Forced by his position to frequent all the public places of amusement-Clara, who was his constant companion, invariably attracted the attention of the house. Not only was she beautiful, but her beauty had a classical character, which distinguished her amid all the merely pretty and handsome faces which thronged around her.</p> 
                
               <p>"So artistic!" said the artists, who were aiming at establishing their reputation as having studied the classical.</p> 
               <p>"So very Italian-so Madonna-like!" said the long-bearded students, who had squandered a year or two at Rome.</p> 
               <p>"So poetical!" murmured the embryo poets, in search of Beatrices and Lauras.</p> 
               <p>"So pure and lovely!" re-echoed the women, who, judging that Clara never attempted any extravagance of dress, thought her a "little inoffensive thing," whom they could afford to admire.</p> 
               <p>And so Clara had become the fashion, and helped, unconsciously, her husband's success.</p> 
               <p>But if three years of happiness had developed her beauty, they had, above all, developed her mind, until genius had been evoked. Judicious studies, encouraged by Rushton and directed by Mary, had made her a most intellectual and well-informed woman. An enthusiastic musician, the first masters had been engaged, by the proud young husband, to cultivate the richest voice nature had ever bestowed on one of her loveliest daughters. If Clara had never acquired the polished manners taught in high society, there was an innate dignity and repose in her manner, which had supplied the place of all teaching.</p> 
               <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7216-00000116"/> 
               <p>The world, however, only admired her beauty. Devoted to her husband, adoring her child, her mind ever occupied, Clara neither sought nor mingled in society. This was fortunate for her popularity; for it is impossible to be famous for two things. The world, which has so much trouble in admitting one superiority, revolts at, and denies even that, if a second is added to the list. Besides, all the men, artists, poets, etc., who so admired Clara, as a classical beauty, would have been afraid of her if they had detected any intellectual superiority or great accomplishment. The women only would have eagerly proclaimed Clara a genius, because then they might have denied her claims to be a beauty.</p> 
               <p>Clara's nature was reserved, though not timid; but she preferred the society of the few she was accustomed to see, to new and numerous acquaintances, and a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tte--tte</foreign> with Harry to every thing else. Still, to please him, she had, since Mary had left, gone more into society; and, amongst those whom she had seen, Mr. Bayes, with his gentle, deferential manner, had been, perhaps, the acquaintance she preferred.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Zephalinda Bayes had somewhat puzzled her; and she had asked Harry his opinion of her-but Harry had merely replied by going off into a fit of laughter, and twisting himself into various contortions tortions, in imitation of the interesting attitudes into which the "dear little thing" had loved to put herself.</p> 
               <p>Scarcely had she seen the dignified, calm Mrs. Oakwood enter the room, when she felt an instantaneous sympathy for her. Something too, she detected in her manner, which instinctively reminded her of Mary-for Mrs. Oakwood, having "for this occasion," adopted the matronly manners of injured innocence and subdued sorrow, the indescribable affinity which imparts a sort of kindred resemblance to women of the same class and nation, actually did give her a vague resemblance to the protectress of her childhood, who was in reality the pure and dignified woman, Mrs. Oakwood chose on this evening to personate.</p> 
               <p>The dinner, as well as the evening, passed off most pleasantly. Clara listened, unconsciously charmed by the dreamy murmuring conversation of her host, who, it is true, rarely said a remarkable thing, but had the art of causing "excellence in others." He so complacently and ingeniously knew how to put those with whom he conversed in a good humor with themselves, that they were disposed to accord all sorts of good qualities to him, and imagine him possessed of all the mental gifts he had had the art of drawing out of<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7216-00000117"/> them. Just as Mme. Necker, having been reverentially listened to by a deaf and dumb man, declared him, not aware of his defect, or conscious of her own loquacity, to have been the most agreeable man she had ever met.</p> 
               <p>Then "dear Zephy," who was fond of being a juvenile mother-though she was past thirty when she became a wife-sent for the baby. Spite of the angry glances of the insinuating Bayes, and the contempt which curled his lip, she dandled it and fondled it, protesting it was "so heavy!" and shaking her curls at the dull lump of earth, vowed it was the ideal of Albano's babies-though poor Zephy, to speak the truth, had never seen a painting of Albano in her life.</p> 
               <p>Then Mrs. Oakwood, turning sweetly to Clara, had asked her about her own little girl-and Clara, making an involuntary comparison in her mind's eye, had replied with blushing cheek and a flash of pleasure, to the judicious questions of Mrs. Oakwood, to whom Clara's baby appeared an object of the deepest interest.</p> 
               <p>"If I had a child to love!" murmured Caroline, with a sigh; and abruptly turning away her head, she appeared to dash away an unbidden tear.</p> 
               <p>"Poor thing!" said Clara, as, pleased and contented, she walked home with Harry; "poor thing! I know she adores her husband; and if you had seen the tear in her eyes when she spoke of having no child! Is she not beautiful?"</p> 
               <p>"No," said Harry, "she is coarse and masculine."</p> 
               <p>"For shame, Harry!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I never looked at her; or rather, she never looked at me; she was so thoroughly taken up with you. By-the-by, I tell you what, I don't believe a word of the stories circulated about her; she is a thorough woman's woman-not at all calculated to please men, and perfectly quiet and reserved in her manner. I shall certainly take her part."</p> 
               <p>"Of course. Good heavens, who could suspect any one so calm and matronly! Why, she looks like the mother of the Gracchi, or Portia."</p> 
               <p>"I'll get your bonnet, dear Carry," said Zephy, as Carry, after the departure of the guests, rose to take leave.</p> 
               <p>"Yes do," said Bayes, "and you, Carry, come here-I want to say something to you."</p> 
               <p>Carry followed Bayes into the dining-room, which was a third room on the parlor floor, divided from them by a glass door, before which blinds were hung, as at a window.</p> 
               <p>Going to the sideboard, Bayes drew forth two or<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7216-00000118"/> three bottles, and selecting one, poured out a glass full of its contents, which he handed to Caroline.</p> 
               <p>"Maraschino, fair lady-you want something to recruit your strength."</p> 
               <p>Carry took the glass, and swallowing its contents, she looked up to Bayes, with an expression in the half-vailed eye and the half-opened mouth, which made her rather resemble Las or Phryne, than Portia or Cornelia.</p> 
               <p>"How have I behaved, dear Bayes?" said she; "do I deserve a reward?" and she took his hand.</p> 
               <p>Bayes stooped down; and moving her lace collar aside, he pressed his lips on her neck.</p> 
               <p>Carry's eyes flashed and danced, and she pressed his hand; but he listlessly let hers fall, and sinking into a chair, exclaimed,</p> 
               <p>"You really did very well. Stick to the women! That little woman, too, of to-night is very popular-virtuous, immaculate, and all that sort of thing; and being beautiful, it will be very effective to be her friend."</p> 
               <p>"I'm sure I won her heart," said Carry; "and as for her husband, nothing, you must say, could have been more proper-why, I perfectly ignored his existence."</p> 
               <p>"You were quite right, Carry, for he most likely totally ignored yours-there is not another woman in the world for him, excepting his own wife."</p> 
               <p>"Here is the carriage, dear Carry," said "Zephy"-the well-drilled Zephy-judiciously fumbling at the door, before she opened it;</p> 
               <p>"Good night, then, all!" and Mrs. Oakwood returned to the respectable roof of her orthodox friend.</p> 
               <p>Now, as she closed her eyes that night, she thought not of interests, not of Bayes, nor of the future; but she thought of Harry Rushton's eyes, of his enthusiastic manners, of his deep sonorous voice-and she murmured, as she fell asleep,</p> 
               <p>"There is only <emph>one</emph> woman in the world for him, <emph>now!</emph> Ah, ah, Bayes! that was an imprudent speech!"</p>

               <p>THE separation of Mrs. Oakwood from her husband, important as it was to herself and her immediate circle of friends, was not, even by them, supposed likely ever to become a matter of public interest, excepting when, through their clever manuverings, they should have brought it before the public courts, in order that Caroline might obtain what she so ardently desired-liberty and money.</p> 
               <p>But from the extreme popularity of Edgar Oakwood, both as an actor and as an active member of one of the political factions which ever vary the monotony of a well-established republic, and have ever flourished in all ardor, from the Roman, the greatest of the ancient republics, down to the American, the greatest of modern ones, his domestic affairs became also a matter of political party. The various journals took up the case, either for or against, and as their politics might incline, defended either the wife or the husband. Then, there was another subject to give eloquence to their pens-that Caroline was a foreigner, and he was a native-born citizen, of whose genius his countrymen justly loved to boast and to uphold. But then, Caroline was a woman-an oppressed, forsaken woman-a situation from which sympathy, or at least a hue and cry of sympathy, can always be raised in a country which professes reverential love and chivalric protection for the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">genus</foreign> woman, though individually it has a mighty poor opinion of the sex, and its intellectual and moral capacities-treating women like an ill-brought-up baby, rather than a rational being.</p> 
               <p>This, however, is digression-and in this case, out of place. Still, it leads to the statement that through all these motives, Caroline, to her utter amazement, "awoke one day and found herself famous."</p> 
               <p>To say with what avidity she devoured the different violent, sentimental, and moral essays which, day after day, appeared in the public press, would be useless. The dream of her life had been fame; and here, almost without an effort on her part, she had obtained it. She liked the articles which were against<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7216-00000120"/> her, quite as much as she did those in her favor-all she desired was to be written about, talked about, and carried on the shoulders of public opinion to the <emph>capitol</emph> of fame.</p> 
               <p>To Harry Rushton, enthusiastic by nature, this was exactly the cause which would inspire him. Accordingly, one evening, his journal came out with an enthusiastic eulogium of the immaculate Caroline, and a dissertation on her wrongs, worthy of Burke, whose defence of Marie Antoinette he quoted, comparing the queenly Caroline to the unhappy queen of France-in all her virtues, and in the injustice which had assailed her.</p> 
               <p>Caroline, when she read this eloquent outburst, was delighted, and her vanity suggested that admiration for herself had almost involuntarily inspired the young editor.</p> 
               <p>At all events, she felt it her bounden duty to go and thank Mr. Rushton; and therefore, one afternoon, just as Harry, his paper in hand, had returned from the office, Mrs. Oakwood was announced.</p> 
               <p>Caroline almost paused, and almost sighed, as she gazed upon the quiet, peaceful picture of love and home which she beheld.</p> 
               <p>The blinds were down, for it was summer; but still, by the subdued light Caroline took in at a glance the simple yet tasteful arrangements of the room, destined not to the wife and frivolous visitors, but the joint habitation of wife and husband, who, when under the same roof, were rarely apart.</p> 
               <p>Harry's large writing-table was in the centre-all the papers of the day were, by some neat hand, smoothly laid upon it. There, too, was a vase filled with fresh flowers; and on the extreme corner was a pretty work-basket, from which depended the half-embroidered sleeve of a tiny frock.</p> 
               <p>When Caroline entered, Harry was lying on a sofa, where, tired and exhausted by the day's labors, he had thrown himself. He was busily engaged in trying to harness a wooden horse to a wooden waggon; while by his side, looking up to him with earnest, loving, wondering blue eyes, stood his darling Marie, then just two years old.</p> 
               <p>Both father and daughter were absorbed in their occupation, but both were still and silent, for Clara was at the piano, singing, in her deep, passionate voice; and as Caroline entered unperceived, from the position of the door, by any but the child, the baby gravely put a finger to her lips, and pointing to mamma, shook her curly head, enforcing silence.</p> 
               <p>Caroline, as the servant closed the door after her, paused, and sometimes, in after life, this peaceful, holy<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7216-00000121"/> scene of love has risen before her. Still, her plans were unchanged. On the contrary, the happier Harry was, the greater triumph would it be to win him from all he loved!</p> 
               <p>The father saw the child's action, and turning round beheld Caroline. He started up, and calling to Clara, they both advanced and welcomed her.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Rushton," said Caroline, when the first salutations were over. But here she paused: and leaning her head on the arm of the sofa, on which she was sitting, she burst into a fit of irrepressible sobs.</p> 
               <p>Clara was deeply moved, and Harry walked away to hide his emotion-while the child, unused to sorrow, but instinctively comprehending suffering from tears, crept up to Caroline, and looking up to her, murmured,</p> 
               <p>"Don't ky, don't ky!"</p> 
               <p>At these words Caroline lifted up her head, and snatching the child to her still heaving bosom, she said,</p> 
               <p>"Forgive me, forgive me! but in my isolated, miserable position, any proof of kindness touches me to the heart. Oh, Mr. Rushton," added she, turning on him the full passion of her deep-blue eye, made lustrous by the tear she had conjured up; "oh, Mr. Rushton, how shall I thank you for the eloquent, the generous defence you have so nobly written? You, too, Mrs. Rushton,-ah, I know you influenced, you inspired it; I must thank you, too."</p> 
                
               <p>"Do not thank us at all," said Harry; "anyone who had seen you, must know how false, how utterly unfounded, was all that tended to inculpate you."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Clara, "you must and will find friends."</p> 
               <p>"Friends," said Caroline, looking down mournfully, and mechanically parting the fair ringlets of the child she held on her lap; "alas! I have lost the only friend on whom woman can rely-the only object of my devoted love-the husband for whom I left friends, kindred, even renounced my country. And now I am alone-and when I saw you here together, so happy, with this sweet cherub-forgive me! it was that, that upset my nerves, and made me weak and foolish. Home-happiness!" said Caroline, invocatively; "neither can ever be mine again. I am a wanderer, and alone."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dearest Mrs. Oakwood," said Clara, "do not say that! Oh, I have been, indeed, alone, helpless, and unfriended. But see-I have found happiness at last, and peace, and love; and so will you again. Dearest lady, I am not well versed in the world's ways; beyond my home I have no friends; the only one I had is far, far away-and as I look at you, though you are younger, and oh, far more beautiful, there is something that reminds me of dear Mary, and makes me love you. Will you let me?" and sweet Clara held out her soft, melting hand to Caroline.</p> 
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7216-00000122"/> 
               <p>She threw her arms round Clara, and pressing her to her bosom, she exclaimed,</p> 
               <p>"Oh, thank you, thank you, for the only ray of happiness which has enlightened my sad fate! I too was irresistibly drawn towards you, and longed to love you, though I fear to love-for those I have loved have spurned me."</p> 
               <p>"You may trust Clara, dear madam-she is truth and love combined. She has, as she says, no friend; she is always here alone, when I am not here; come to her; come to us, and you will ever find sympathy, admiration, and affection."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Clara; "and now don't go away today. Begin our friendship now, by staying here till evening. Harry shall take you home, and I'll show you all the pretty house that Mary, your shadow, gave me; and you shall hear how many pretty words our little Marie can say; she has quite taken a fancy to you."</p> 
               <p>"And Clara shall sing to you, Mrs. Oakwood," said Rushton;-"no small favor, I assure you, for few have heard her, I keep her voice for myself-it makes me forget the meannesses and petty vexations I bring from this commonplace world, in which we live, and I assure you, soothes and calms me in an instant."</p> 
               <p>Caroline allowed her friends to prevail, and in a very few hours the Rushtons thought her the most domestic, the most amiable, the most delightful, and the most highly principled woman, they had ever encountered; and Rushton said to Clara, as they were together for a few moments, preparing for their dinner-it was Harry's habit to take it at the European hour of six-that the man who could not live with Caroline Oakwood, and be proud of her, deserved no pity; "and," added he, "Clara, she is, I begin to think, rather handsome."</p> 
               <p>"Do you live all alone?" inquired Clara, as Mrs. Oakwood, after a delightful evening, rose to take leave.</p> 
               <p>"I live no where at present," said Caroline, with a faint smile; "my home is that of others; my home at present is with the Field Closes-you know them, Mr. Rushton, of course?"</p> 
               <p>"I know him, intimately, and as much of her as I wish to know, which is mighty little. She is the essence of propriety and respectability-a set beyond me-and belongs to the domain of old fogeyism."</p> 
               <p>"Naughty Mr. Rushton!" said Carry.</p> 
               <p>"I'm sure <emph>you</emph> must be bored to death, what with Field's sarcasms at his family-not sparing even himself-Mrs. Field Close's lamentations, her sickly children, and her mother's commenplaces-to say nothing<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7216-00000123"/> of the father of the race, the great poet of America, who sometimes appears solemnly, like the statue of the Commander, at the frugal banquet of the Closes."</p> 
               <p>"But then you know," said Carry, entering into the same spirit of criticism on her absent friends, of whom she had made a stepping-stone; "the son-in-law disappears; for the great poet entertains a solemn hatred for him, and has signified, by a positive edict, that when he honors his daughter's house, his antipathy is to be kept out of his way. I believe he does all he can to forget his existence."</p> 
               <p>"Though the constant renewal of rickety grandchildren must, I should think, oblige him to remember that they have a 'papa.'"</p> 
               <p>"What an unhappy home that must be for you! Oh," added Clara, seizing Caroline's hands; "oh, I have such a brilliant idea! Yes, yes, that's it, Harry-I know by your eyes you have divined it!"</p> 
               <p>"Our house is large," said Harry, smiling.</p> 
               <p>"That's it," said Clara, "and we are always alone."</p> 
               <p>"And you have fallen in love with Mrs. Oakwood!"</p> 
               <p>"That's it! and I want," pursued Clara, "that she should just think she's known us as many years as she has hours, and that she should leave those tiresome Field Closes, and come to us. That's my idea, Harry."</p> 
                
               <p>"And mine, Clara, exactly-and yours, I hope, dearest madam," said Harry, looking so earnestly at Caroline that her heart began to beat; "we will make you so happy-only try us!"</p> 
               <p>"Really-are you in earnest? Why, what shall I say? I have spent here the calmest, happiest hours, that have fallen to my lot since the dreadful event," said she, always subduing her voice and lowering her eyes at these words; "oh, Mr. Rushton! oh, Clara! forgive me if I call you so-but it is impossible not to love you, and to feel drawn towards you! Have I, indeed, found friends?-have I, indeed, found a brother, and another sister?"</p> 
               <p>"Then you will come to your home!" eagerly exclaimed Clara; and Mrs. Oakwood, in reply, clasped her friend in her arms; then, turning to Harry, she took both his hands, and looking into his face, with something of the expression she had wasted on Bayes, after the maraschino, she said,</p> 
               <p>"Oh, sir, may Heaven render to your little child, your goodness to a poor forsaken woman!"</p> 
               <p>And so all was settled-and Harry, as he accompanied Mrs. Oakwood to where she now resided, arranged all the preliminaries with her, and as he walked back to his own home, he said to himself-</p> 
               <p>"I wonder what I could be thinking of, when I<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7216-00000124"/> said she wasn't handsome! Why, she's positively beautiful!"</p> 
               <p>This time, however, Harry did not confide to Clara the change in his opinions with regard to her friend.</p>

               <p>IT was raining very hard; and Broadway from the splendid promenade, crowded with carriages, bespeaking, as well as the toilets of the ladies who stepped from them, that no sumptuary laws had as yet been enacted by the young republic, was converted into a broad, irregular street, with broken and interrupted causeways-the ill-paved street displayed in all its yawning ugliness, by the large puddles of water in which the rain danced and spirted. This street appeared now to have no purpose but that of a racecourse to a succession of omnibuses, which, with these green-umbrellaed drivers, and their streaming horses, tore up and down, from morning till night.</p> 
               <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7216-00000125"/> 
               <p>From one of these omnibuses, pulling the string just as it reached Leonard street, on its way from up town towards Fulton Ferry, there descended a lady. She was very properly dressed for the season and the weather, being all in black, while a close vail concealed her features.</p> 
               <p>She hurried as fast as she could, not either gracefully or skillfully avoiding the puddles and pools, till she reached a large, ungainly brick house, which from its very aspect revealed what it was-a cheap boarding-house. The door, as usual in such houses, stood open; and making rapid bounds along the dirty hall, and up the no less dirty stairs, the lady found herself in a small room on the third floor-not, as she had expected, in the presence of one gentleman, but of four.</p> 
               <p>She started back, as she looked from one to the other, for she knew them all; then, throwing up her vail, she resolutely advanced, and with a defiant look and a scornful smile, she seated herself in an arm chair, and looked interrogatively towards the one nearest to her, whom she had expected alone to have seen.</p> 
               <p>"Madam," said he, thus tacitly addressed, "I thank you for coming to me; you must understand that, under existing circumstances, I could not venture to come to a house inhabited by you."</p> 
                
               <p>"Sir," said Caroline-for it was she-reddening and looking round, as if to remind him of the presence of the others--</p> 
               <p>"Madam," resumed the gentleman, "I am aware there are others present; but what I say, they also have to say to you-for I believe, madam, we have every reason to think that you have treated us all with equal favor, and that we all have an equal right to your confidence. Do not rise indignantly, madam; with us you have no part to play-we know you-and I, madam, am not, though my name is Bayes, so well versed in the hypocrisies of the world as to deem them graceful vices. I know of no such vices. I have, though a brother of the poet who scoffs at all sacred and serious things, profound principles and religious scruples. You know that, madam, for you must remember the deep remorse with which on the night of our folly and our fault, I, concealed like a thief beneath your husband's roof, mourned over the error which involuntary passion, youth, and extraordinary temptation, had led me into. You, too, wept your <emph>first</emph> your <emph>only</emph> fault-and so truly, that even in the midst of my remorse and horror, an involuntary respect-but I will not go on. I care not now for the past-I have repented, and removed far from your sphere of corruption. What I would say-what<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7216-00000126"/> I brought you here to listen to-is, that I will not come into open court, to tell a lie in the face of God and man."</p> 
               <p>"Nor I," repeated another voice.</p> 
               <p>"Nor I," was echoed by a third.</p> 
               <p>"Nor I," solemnly added a fourth.</p> 
               <p>Caroline grew paler and paler, as each voice met her ear, and quailed beneath the glances of contempt and scorn which greeted her, as she turned from one to the other. For an instant she hid her face in her hands; then suddenly raising her head, and looking defiantly on all, returning scorn for scorn, she rose, and leaning on the back of her chair, with a half hysterical laugh, she exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"A most dramatic scene, gentlemen, but not original; it resembles wonderfully one in Lucrezia Borgia. But pardon me, if I say, your conduct resembles wonderfully little that of gentlemen, or even men. But I care not; I am not afraid of you; I defy you. I have determined to establish my innocence and my fame; I have help and counsel-they have deemed your aid necessary, and they shall have it! Withhold it if you dare! Suppose your charges true-think you the world, though it may condemn me, will exonerate you for witnessing against the woman who has confided in you, who has loved you?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Loved!" said the first speaker, with a curl of the lip. "Madam, when a tender, loving woman confides in a man's honor, and loves him faithfully-even though that love is error-he is bound to defend her with his life, and even God will forgive the lie which shields her. But when a woman does but pass from one act of crime to another, and goes to a new lover with the kisses of another still hot upon her lips, then, even in his arms listens for the footstep of a third, and breathes in her heart the name of a fourth-deceiving all, degrading the holiest passion of our nature-man is no longer bound even by the world's code of honor, to perjure his soul to shield a wanton from just retribution."</p> 
               <p>"A chivalrous code, Robert Bayes! But I fear you not. Go from the side of your bride, from the home her wealth has given you, and in the face of a public court, declare that you have been an adulterer. Tell her, through the public prints, that you have poured forth words of passion in a wanton's arms, and see what years of strife and misery will follow the honeymoon which has made you so righteous and so scrupulous!</p> 
               <p>"And you," continued she, addressing another, who stood near him; "you, most gallant captain! it will sound well to your noble relatives in England, that<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7216-00000127"/> you, to whom a public mission was given to make your forced exile respectable-it will sound well to hear you trying to shield your reputation and morality-you, a worthless debauchee-behind the reputation of a woman, your own country-woman too!</p> 
               <p>"And you, sir! you, indeed though, are no gentleman," said Caroline, her tone growing more bitter; her eye flashing more angrily, as she proceeded; "and therefore, perhaps, the world may forgive your ignorance of the laws of honor and chivalry. And so you will not come to witness to my innocence! Take care, sir, that you come not into court, not as a witness, but as a criminal; for, sir, it is better even to be accused of gallantry than-piracy!"</p> 
               <p>At this word, the man to whom she spoke started; but Caroline disdaining even to watch the effect of her terrible accusation, went on; and crossing her arms, she stood for an instant before the last of her accusers.</p> 
               <p>"Horace," said she, "I knew not you were here; I thought we should never meet again. But if you have ventured within the grasp of the lion, who can destroy you, it must be that you come as my defender. You dare not be an accuser. Have I not still your burning confessions of love?-am I not your ideal? Ah! ah! Edgar even was lost in admiration at your ardent style! Why, you will obtain, perhaps, as a writer, the reputation you have so long in vain tried to achieve as an actor!"</p> 
               <p>"Caroline," replied he, whom she addressed, in a tone of gentle expostulation; "I cannot deny that your own imprudence, your own vanity, by preserving the effusions of the mad passions you excited, has placed my guilt beyond a doubt; but against you I will not come. I am not here to threaten that; I am here to entreat-not by any remembrance of past times-I know you too well to think they would ever influence you; but by the simplest considerations of prudence-to draw back from the open shame which awaits you. What! brave an open trial! You, who are in the power of so many-you, who have scorned, wounded, slighted and forgotten so many, who will rise up to wreak a tardy vengeance upon you! Those who have advised this madness, know not of your past life. You cannot have dared to tell your defender what he has to fear!"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing, sir-I fear nothing-not even your cowardly threats-nor do I dread the coming trial more now, than before I knew the brave decision to which you all have come. For I know I have now revealed to you motives of self-interest which will outweigh when you are calm and alone, all the high-flown principles of your new code of honor. When the hour<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7216-00000128"/> comes, you will not fail me, nor will your testimony. It <emph>cannot</emph> fail me-for if you but think, I have you all, ay, all, in my power. And so, gentlemen, it is better even to let a woman whom once you have adored and overwhelmed with flattery, escape unpunished for the crime of having forgotten you, and forsaken you, than to lose your own hard-earned respectability. No, gentlemen, I fear you not! and so I leave you, never more to exchange one word of greeting with you-for though we are forced to be allies, henceforth we are enemies forever more."</p> 
               <p>So saying, Caroline walked with a firm and heavy step across the room, and with her hand on the lock of the door, she turned once more and glared on her enemies, with looks of scorn and defiance; then opening it, she passed out and disappeared.</p> 
               <p>Caroline, when she reached the street, paused, even though the rain descended still with unabated fury. The scene she had just passed through had been unexpected and violent, and her strength and her resolution were exhausted. But indomitable will, and a power of controlling her feelings, exercised from her earliest years, soon restored her to apparent calmness.</p> 
               <p>With a quick step, lest she should be overtaken by some of those she had left in the house, she gained the corner of Broadway, and proceeding to the carriage stand opposite the Park, she sought refuge in the nearest to her, desiring to be driven to the office of an eminent lawyer.</p> 
               <p>By the time the carriage stopped at his door, though the distance was not great, Caroline had completely recovered her composure, and neither face nor manner bore any trace of the violent passions which had just agitated her.</p> 
               <p>The office she entered, was a dirty, untidy, close room, crammed with briefs and papers of all kinds; but in it sat the most eminent lawyer of the day.</p> 
               <p>He was a tall, spare man, dressed in a manner becoming his age and profession, as far removed from neglect, as from elegance. He was what is called middle-aged; his hair, however, whilst his complexion retained some of the freshness of youth, had early assumed the livery of old age. His features were insignificant, excepting his small piercing dark eyes, brilliant, without either depth or transparency, and his mouth, the thin lips of which could assume any form, changing at once the character of the face, the habitual expression of which was one of bitterness and sarcasm.</p> 
               <p>At the moment Caroline entered, the clenched teeth, revealed by the distended lips, gave a ferocious expression of hatred and revenge to his features which, as the<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7216-00000129"/> twinkling fiery black eye turned on Caroline, startled and alarmed her, more even than the unexpected encounter from which she had just escaped.</p> 
               <p>"Madam," said Sylvius Dysart, "are you prepared? You shall gain your cause. We will conquer, even if my whole fortune is required. Do not thank me-I understand all that-you have a purpose to achieve, and so have I. You, madam, have been deeply injured, as a woman and as a wife. I believe all you have suffered-aye, and we will find witnesses to prove it, too!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, sir!" said Caroline, lost in amazement-for until now, this man, whom she had endeavored by all means to secure as her defender,-not daring to seduce, nor being able to bribe him-had hitherto received her with abrupt manners and dry sarcastic speeches. "Oh, sir! my eternal gratitude shall be yours; and the first proceeds of what shall be assigned me shall be dedicated to prove how deeply-"</p> 
               <p>"Madam," said Dysart, impatiently interrupting her; "I don't care for your gratitude, and I don't want your money-but I want a true and sincere co-operation with me-do you understand, madam?-true and sincere," added the lawyer, laying a marked emphasis on the words. "We must work on public sympathy and public opinion. It will be hard work; but if you are what I take you to be, you will not fail me. Be at my command-money, time, zeal, shall not be wanting. Good morning, madam-I will communicate through your solicitors. Good morning!"</p> 
               <p>Caroline curtsied deferentially; then, as she descended the stairs, down which she almost danced, she said to herself,</p> 
               <p>"Now I shall have my triumph!"</p> 
               <p>While she was forgetting all her humiliations and troubles in this assurance, Dysart, following her with a look of contempt, ground his teeth, and muttered,</p> 
               <p>"Now I shall be revenged! This, this is the instrument with which to inflict the deep, irreparable wound on the proud bully who has insulted me!"</p>

               <p>IT must not be supposed that Caroline's residence of six months under the same roof with Clara and Rushton, had not changed the atmosphere of the love and happiness which had hallowed it when first she knew them.</p> 
               <p>The change was gradual and insensible. Neither Clara nor Rushton was perhaps aware of it; though Harry had become restless and discontented, and a shade of melancholy had stolen over her before bright and sunny character.</p> 
               <p>Immersed in her intellectual occupations, in her artistic tastes, her heart fully occupied by her affections, Clara looked on the minor details of life with an indifference which enabled Caroline to gain a gradual ascendency over her, and an almost unlimited power in the household. Caroline loved power; Clara did not care for it, and was quite as well pleased to be a guest, even in her own house, as if she were the mistress in a palace.</p> 
               <p>Caroline, too, from her long residence with the Rushtons, had insisted on sharing the expenses of the household-for money had no intrinsic value to Caroline, excepting as it forwarded her own views. Of all things she hated dependence; and being, in fact, partly mistress of the house, gave her the opportunity of quietly taking possession of the undivided authority.</p> 
               <p>The two rooms on the second floor, which had been fitted up for Mary and Mr. Edwards, and which they had occupied during their short stay in New York, had been made over to Mrs. Oakwood, and one of them had been converted into a boudoir, while she had retained the other as her bed-room.</p> 
               <p>In this boudoir it was Mrs. Oakwood's custom to receive her visits; and in this boudoir Harry Rushton had imperceptibly come to spend most of his time.</p> 
               <p>Clara indeed had free ingress, and there was nothing in the conversations that were carried on between Caroline and her husband that could possibly have roused her jealousy-if so true, and pure, and unsuspicous a nature had been capable of jealousy.</p> 
               <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7216-00000131"/> 
               <p>But these conversations were mostly on metaphysical and philosophical subjects; and in these discussions, if Caroline and Rushton spoke not of each other, they talked <emph>at</emph> each other-discussing the doctrines of Fourier and the reformists, of which we have said that Harry Rushton was an ardent disciple, and which he had profoundly studied, and of which Caroline-her mind being utterly incapable of any thing profound-had seized the technical expressions and the leading ideas.</p> 
               <p>Clara had no taste for all this brilliant nonsense. She preferred to leave them to philosophize alone, and then steal away to her piano, and closing the doors, revel in her own inspirations, and her own voice. This she only did when quite alone-for Mrs. Oakwood cared not for music-she had neither ear nor taste, and nature had given her, as to the brilliant peacock, a harsh and inharmonious voice for singing, though her own consummate art had modulated her speaking voice to assume sweet, deep and passionate tones.</p> 
               <p>So Clara and her baby enjoyed their music alone-for the child loved its mother's voice, and its tones would bring her toddling from the most remote corner of the house, to her mother's room, where, seated on the floor, gazing up at her, she would listen with the gravity and attention of one of the angels, the harmonies of Saint Cecilia summoned from the skies.</p> 
                
               <p>On the day on which Caroline had been to Leonard street, Harry Rushton had returned home earlier than usual.</p> 
               <p>His first inquiry, after mechanically returning Clara's kiss, and cordially embracing his darling Marie, had been for Mrs. Oakwood-or Caroline, as their intimacy had now authorized him to call her.</p> 
               <p>"Gone out!" exclaimed Harry, throwing himself impatiently on the sofa; "in such weather, where can she be gone?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, you know," said Clara, "poor thing, she has to go to these terrible lawyers"-and, as usual, she sat down to the piano.</p> 
               <p>Harry fidgetted-got up-arranged the fire-looked out of the window-and appeared thoroughly discomposed.</p> 
               <p>At length a rustling was heard in the hall which adjoined the parlor.</p> 
               <p>"Hush," said Harry, "do stop that terrible music! Your voice is so powerful, it prevents my hearing any thing else."</p> 
               <p>Oh, Harry! where was the memory of that time when you vowed that you would rather hear that voice than any thing else in the world!</p> 
               <p>Clara, though she uttered not these words, felt a sudden pang at her heart; and involuntarily her eyes<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7216-00000132"/> filled with tears, as she rose, and scarcely knowing why, stood for a moment perfectly still before the piano, gazing on the keys.</p> 
               <p>"There she is!" said Harry, bounding to the door, and opening it, just as Caroline, weary and wet, was about to pass it and repair to her own apartments.</p> 
               <p>"I am so glad you have returned!" said Harry, "I was so anxious--"</p> 
               <p>"And I so weary, so exhausted, so worn-out!" said Carry, just looking in and nodding to Clara, "that I am only fit company for myself. Do not expect me down to dinner-I must be alone for a few hours, and then I shall grow calm again."</p> 
               <p>Clara at these words roused herself, and went up to Caroline with eager expressions of interest.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, dearest," said Caroline, "for all your anxiety. There is no great misfortune-but the spirit sometimes will grow weary, and the heart weak."</p> 
               <p>And so, with a patient, gentle smile, and a long glance exchanged with Harry, Caroline went to her own apartments.</p> 
               <p>But if Harry had been out of temper before, he now grew positively cross; and having teazed the baby into the same temper, causing it to be dismissed to its nursery, he sat down to dinner, resolved to find fault with all and every thing.</p> 
                
               <p>He kept his resolution, too; and all through that dull evening-Clara often remembered it, for it afterwards became a painful date to her-his irritation increased; until, remembering that poor Harry had much to worry and annoy him, and that, as dear Carry said, the spirit may grow weary too, without appearing to have noticed his ill-humor, but pleading a headache in order that he might not afterwards feel he had been unkind, Clara withdrew to her room.</p> 
               <p>But her absence, scarcely perceived by Harry, did not calm either his restlessness or his agitation. He tried to write, and this he accomplished-for the paragraphing of a newspaper was almost mechanical with him; but when he strove to write so as to distract his mind, he could not form a sentence. His temples beat-a fever appeared to pervade his whole being. He tried to read, but soon he threw down the book; and at last, clasping his hands over his head, he lay, in a sort of restless, waking dream, till the dying embers of the fire, the utter silence of the house and streets, reminded him that it was late.</p> 
               <p>Then he rose hastily, and slowly began to ascend the stairs. When he reached the door of Caroline's boudoir, he involuntarily paused; his heart beat quick, and all the blood in his veins appeared to leap to his<pb n="266 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7216-00000133"/> brain, making him almost gasp for breath. She too, slept not-the light streamed from beneath the door-she slept not! and as this conviction flashed upon Harry, unable to resist the temptation, he opened the door and entered.</p> 
               <p>"Harry!" exclaimed Caroline, her eyes beaming with pleasure, as she stretched out both hands towards him. Then suddenly she turned her head away, and bent her eyes to the ground, and her whole frame trembled; the hands he grasped became cold and moist in his.</p> 
               <p>"Caroline," said he, "I could not sleep without seeing you;" and his passionate gaze wandered over her face and figure, as she stood before him.</p> 
               <p>She had but a light wrapper over her night-dress, the thin texture of which clung round her form so closely that through its transparent fabric, the pink tinge of her full, voluptuous bosom was visible, as it heaved beneath Harry's ardent looks.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Caroline!" said Harry, as he let fall her hands, and she sank on the sofa; "oh, Caroline! What is it that draws me to your feet, and when near you, sends my blood coursing through my veins as though it was liquid fire? Why do your deep and drooping eyes, heavy with passion, come ever before me? What charm is around you, no other woman ever yet possessed?"</p> 
                
               <p>

               <p>Caroline's heart beat-not with love, nor with passion, nor with fear, but with satisfied vanity. She was rehabilitated in her own esteem. After the deep humiliations of the morning-after having heard herself scorned and disdained-she yearned for some homage that should prove to her that her power to inthrall was unchanged. The husband of the loveliest woman she had ever beheld, was trembling with passion at her side-she was satisfied, and defied her enemies once more!</p> 
               <p>"Speak, Caroline! speak!" said Harry, putting his arm round her full and yielding form; "sorceress-goddess-woman! tell me your charm!"</p> 
               <p>Caroline laid her head on his bosom, and with both her hands pressed his to her heart-then, looking up to him, with a glance beaming with tenderness and passion, she murmured, as his lips bent down to hers,</p> 
               <p>"It is love!"</p>

               <p>WHEN Clara awoke, as the dark winter's day began to dawn, she found that Harry was not by her side. Immediately she arose, and hurrying across her bedroom, softly tried to open the door of his dressing-room-a room in which Harry sometimes, either when detained late, or when Clara or himself was indisposed, slept.</p> 
               <p>Clara, imagining that his unusual state of mind had terminated in one of the violent headaches to which he was subject, was not therefore unusually alarmed at his absence; but when, on trying the door, she found it locked, a strange feeling of vague and undefined alarm crept over her.</p> 
               <p>Still, that might be accidental. Harry, entering from the outer door, might have forgotten to ascertain whether the door between the two rooms was open or shut-so she gently tapped at the door, saying,</p> 
               <p>"Harry, Harry, are you ill?"</p> 
               <p>For some time Harry replied not; at length he said,</p> 
               <p>"What is it?"</p> 
               <p>"It is Clara-the door is fastened; let me in, dearest Harry, that I may bathe your temples-for I know you are ill."</p> 
               <p>But Harry stirred not, though Clara waited impatiently, her hand on the lock of the door, ready to open it when she should hear the bolt withdrawn.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Clara!" at length replied he, as from a gentle noise she made with the lock, he discovered that she was still there; "for Heaven's sake, leave me alone!-all I want is sleep!"</p> 
               <p>Clara relinquished her hold instantly, and a deep blush suffused her brow. She was offended at the unkind words, and her resentment for a time prevented any suspicions of any diminution of Harry's love, from the abrupt cross words he had uttered.</p> 
               <p>But when they met in the morning, the cold, embarrassed manner in which her husband replied to her kind yet reserved greetings-his resolute avoidance of<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7216-00000136"/> her glance, and the hurried way in which he left her, filled her with alarm and dread.</p> 
               <p>She sat down by Harry's writing-table, and taking her little girl on her knees, remained in silence, her eyes wandering mechanically over the familiar objects around, as if to see whether they were not all changed-for life appeared to her suddenly to be transformed.</p> 
               <p>Then, she knew not by what invisible connection, her thoughts suddenly reverted to her mother's death-bed-to the vague words of reproach and regret for one who had loved and forsaken her. Heretofore these vague words had been faint and indistinct to her, as the characters written in the pale liquid which the application of fire alone can make distinct. In fiery, indelible characters these words were now, one by one, engraven on Clara's heart and brain. She understood her mother's fate-she wept for it again; and as she looked forward with forebodings of misery to her own, she strained her darling to her heart, calling, for the first time in her life, this bright child of love and happiness,</p> 
               <p>"Poor wretch! poor wretch!"</p> 
               <p>And there she sat; the child crept softly from her lap, and tired of its inactivity, went to its nursery. But she heeded it not. There she sat, immovable-the only thing in the world she now waited for, as for a fiat of her fate, was Harry's return; and until she had seen him again, she was insensible to all the outward world.</p> 
               <p>The servants came in and out, and she answered their questions mechanically; but she breathed not, she moved not, till she heard Harry's latch-key turn in the lock, and his well-known step resound in the hall.</p> 
               <p>Then, with a deep gasp, the oppression of her heart seemed to pass away, and, as moved by the invisible spring of some cunning machinist, she, with the quick, abrupt movement of an automaton, started to her feet, and then stood still, her eyes fixed on the door.</p> 
               <p>Henry entered-but he was not alone. Bayes was with him; and, by a strange chance, as they entered at one door, Caroline entered from another.</p> 
               <p>In an instant, Clara became calm. The deep voice of Carry, and her words of tender inquiry, might, had she been alone, have moved her to tears; but the soft, low, passionless tones of Bayes, his polished and insinuating phrases, thrust all the overwhelming emotions with which she was struggling, back into her heart, and brought her to the commonplace world at once.</p> 
               <p>"To come from these dreary, dirty streets into the sunshine of two such lovely women," said Bayes, sinking<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7216-00000137"/> ing gracefully into the most comfortable seat in the room, "is like being suddenly transported from Siberia to Sorrento"-and he bowed to Clara, and then waved his hand to Carry.</p> 
               <p>Clara murmured some reply, and Carry, walking across the room, went up and seated herself by Bayes.</p> 
               <p>Harry and Clara stood opposite each other, but neither spoke, and Clara, with one long, lingering look at Harry, as he bent his head over the papers on his table, apparently unaware of her presence,-her lips quivering for an instant only-turned round, and with the sternness which never yet but once had sat upon her brow, she walked resolutely away, and as though she was still the happy Clara of but twenty-four hours ago, she began conversing with Bayes and Caroline.</p> 
               <p>"I am going to take you all away with me," said Bayes: "Zephy and myself want you to come to dinner, for we are all going <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en masse</foreign> this evening to meet a whole host of celebrities, to whom I believe the lady Macnas of New York is desirous of showing us off."</p> 
               <p>"I cannot go," said Caroline; "Mr. Dysart has particularly desired me to avoid going into public."</p> 
               <p>"But Clara and myself will come, at least to <hi rend="i"/>la Finch's," exclaimed Harry, who appeared to be in high spirits; "who the deuce is going to be there?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Why, there's to be a great French actor, who <foreign xml:lang="FRA">belle dame,</foreign> had the honor of bringing the unbidden tear into the eyes which now have the honor of looking at you-a rare thing, I assure you, for I have seen so many great actors that my heart is stage emotion-proof. And then there is to be the great tenor, San Giusto, who you know is an Italian nobleman of some kind, and a political exile, and altogether a grand Mrs. Radcliffe sort of man. But I don't think he will be there, for your friend Captain Ray, who keeps his place at the dinner-tables of the Fifth Avenue, on condition of his bringing all the grand lions he meets, has promised to take San Giusto, I know-for I was invited to meet him,-to Mrs. Wright, in Fifth Avenue."</p> 
               <p>"A dinner and Fifth Avenue, against Finchy and nothing!" said Harry; "I think we have no choice whatever."</p> 
               <p>"Then there are a host of smaller celebrities-a few poets from the South, who have especially come, I believe, to see the editor of the Fireside Gazette-and oh, I had forgotten! a fine young officer, an Italian--"</p> 
               <p>"A hero and an exile, of course!" said Harry; "I never knew an Italian who was not."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; but he is a hero of another kind, I believe. He is more celebrated for his handsome looks, than for<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7216-00000138"/> his sayings and doings, and his greatest claim to be stared at and petted by the ladies, is that he was once the favorite of Lola Montez."</p> 
               <p>"Is that a boast?" said Clara; "I should rather think he ought to strive and hide the fact."</p> 
               <p>"She is, after all, a celebrity!" said Caroline.</p> 
               <p>"And you are young, dear little Clara!" said Bayes.</p> 
               <p>"And prudish," said Harry, abruptly.</p> 
               <p>"No, not prudish," replied Clara; "but there is no crime I cannot forgive sooner than that which degrades love, the most exalted passion of our nature,-misleading the world into confounding all that is true, passionate, and noble, with the shameless exhibition called passion, which on the one side is vanity, and on the other mere morbid sensuality."</p> 
               <p>"Clara!" said Harry, half in reproach, half in astonishment; "you have been, it appears, deeply studying the passions!"</p> 
               <p>"I have," said Clara, gravely, looking steadily at Harry, who turned away his eyes, whilst Caroline looking smilingly at Clara, though her heart beat with fear, exclaimed,</p> 
               <p>"Why, you used to scold me for being metaphysical; and now I declare, you are so profound that I scarcely understand you!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, you will always understand me, Carry, for <emph>you</emph> love me!"</p> 
                
               <p>Carry pressed Clara's hand, and by a rapid sign, showed Harry that he need not fear-that all was safe, and that his wife had no suspicions.</p> 
               <p>Bayes, who found the conversation somewhat mysterious, and who dreaded either to have to make an effort at comprehending what was not necessary to his own individual enjoyment, or being drawn into a scene, now proposed that they should depart.</p> 
               <p>Caroline resolutely declined, but Clara promised to be ready when Mrs. Bayes should call for her in the evening; and Harry, asking five minutes only to change his dress, went off with Bayes to dinner.</p> 
               <p>Carry, during the hours spent alone, treated Clara with the considerate tenderness of one who dreads to touch a sensitive wound. Though she carefully avoided questioning Clara, her gentle and affectionate manner indicated that she was fully aware that some great sorrow had overtaken her friend, and required to be consoled by her affection.</p> 
               <p>Clara felt this delicacy deeply. She loved Caroline all the more-all the more she pitied her sorrows, and her alienation from the husband of her love-for now Clara comprehended all the agony her friend had endured.</p> 
               <p>And so, decked by the hands of Caroline, her beauty enhanced by the shade of sorrow and pensiveness<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7216-00000139"/> which had crept over her beautiful face, Clara stepped into the carriage, which in due time came for her, and conveyed her, with Mrs. Bayes, to the conversazione of the lady who aspired to be the literary patroness of New York.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Rushton had gone, Zephy said, to another engagement, and would meet them there, and the carriage was to be sent back for Bayes.</p> 
               <p>Bayes hated, as he said, to be "smuggled into a room behind a petticoat." He delighted in producing an effect, and therefore declined going, like Darby and Joan, with his wife and the beautiful Mrs. Rushton who necessarily would distract attention from himself.</p> 
               <p>So the carriage returned for him, and Bayes was enabled to make his impressive entrance alone-thus giving full effect, for the benefit of the admiring <emph>young</emph> authors, to his blue coat and brass buttons, his polished boots, his elegant nonchalant walk, and his waving brown hair, of which he was so proud-edifying the gaping multitude by the d'Orsay-way in which he held his hat, and by the profoundly confidential way in which, bowing over the hand of his hostess, he murmured the important words,</p> 
               <p>"Good evening!"</p>

Miss Jessie Finch was quite elated with her glory and success.

               <p>What was ever to follow all this talking work-of what possible benefit it was ever to be to Miss Jessie Finch-was a matter exceedingly puzzling to an inquiring<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7216-00000140"/> quiring mind. How she ever attained the position she certainly had attained of a literary Macnas was another.</p> 
               <p>Miss Jessie Finch was neither young, nor pretty, nor highly born, nor was she particularly clever, or particularly witty-nor had she written a book; and the most partial of her friends could not find any thing on which to found her literary celebrity, beyond an "occasional poem."</p> 
               <p>But Miss Jessie Finch was mistress of one art, which supplies all others-she was a most adroit and indomitable flatterer. To this she owed her success-to this she was indebted for the presence of the distinguished guests she contrived to assemble at her house. But how she toiled, and how she talked! how she, neither humbled nor discouraged by rebuffs, returned week after week to the charge-calling, writing, toadying, running in all weathers from one end of the town to the other-working on the weaknesses of the one, on the jealousies of another, on the vanity of a third, and perfectly satisfied if, after all this toil and trouble, she could look around her on "her night," and behold the hard sofas and the uncomfortable chairs filled with authors, poets, travelers, and authoresses, talking and attitudinizing one against the other.</p> 
               <p>When Bayes made his triumphal entry, Zephy was in a corner, her curls most poetically uncurled, and her eyes almost starting out of her head, with the terrible efforts she was making to speak French to a trim, stiff, polite Frenchman, a grammarian by trade, and a marquis by birth, who had immortalized himself in Zephy's memory, by admiring her foot, and first praising, and then actually kissing, her charming, expressive, "petite main!"</p> 
               <p>On a large, hard ottoman, were seated a number of ladies, remarkable, first for the extraordinary way in which they had twisted their hair. Ringlets streamed over the face of one-inflated bands extended like wings beyond the ears of others-whilst from the broad forehead of a third, the hair was literally torn from the roots, to display the intellectual brow on which genius and thought were supposed to sit. Then their dress! So much muslin over transparent calicos-so many streaming ribbons-so much false jewelry-such large fans, and such picturesque attitudes! These were the "poetesses of America," and when the too-charming Bayes entered, there was amongst them a general wriggle and giggle, and a conscious unconsciousness enacted, so that various pale-bearded and sentimental youths, who stood leaning over them, stopped in the twaddle they were talking, and looked up.</p> 
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7216-00000141"/> 
               <p>Then there was a general pulling up of shirt-collars-for there, the incipient poets of Young America, turned, and beheld their bescented god.</p> 
               <p>Clara, who was nobody but a beauty-a distinction which the scientific and literary class pretend to look on with contemptuous superciliousness, they being the disciples and upholders of intellectual faces full of expression, and heads with bumps extraordinarily developed-distinctions with which they apotheosize ugliness; Clara sat alone.</p> 
               <p>Near her, evidently neither a literary nor a scientific personage, but quite as evidently a profound appreciator of beauty, by the gaze of admiration he fixed on Clara, sat the young Italian officer, of whom Bayes had spoken.</p> 
               <p>Clara was earnestly talking in her own language, her pure Italian; and it was a relief to her, though the tenor of her conversation was indifferent and commonplace, to isolate herself from all around. The words, unlike those in which she had for the few last hours embodied her sufferings, gave her wearied spirit a few moments' reprieve and repose.</p> 
               <p>Great was Miss Jessie Finch's delight, too, as she heard so many various languages echoing in her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">salons,</foreign> and great had been her relief when she saw Mrs. Rushton arrive-for Jessie Finch had not been educated in her early years with a view to her brilliant position of a literary patroness, and she spoke, therefore, no language but her own.</p> 
               <p>As for the young officer, Alessandro Alessandrini, he was in ecstasies with his lovely and piquant countrywoman, who, speaking their own language so perfectly, yet remembered not her own country, and asked him such nave questions about it. He was enchanted, and expressed himself with the freedom and enthusiasm authorized by Italian gallantry, which means no more, though it appears so much more formidable, than the sentimental exchange of sympathies between the transcendentalists.</p> 
               <p>They talked of music, too, and then Alessandrini, whose very handsome head contained but two ideas-women and operas-began to descant on the wonderful tenor, San Giusto, and to go off into ecstasies at the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">si, di petto</foreign> he gave so clearly, and the grand manner in which he declaimed his recitative-illustrating his narrative by little odds and ends of singing, with characteristic gestures, which perfectly astounded Clara, and insensibly wooed her from her one absorbing thought.</p> 
               <p>"But then," continued he, "San Giusto is as great a hero as any he represents. Oh, his history is so romantic! E la vittima del tiranno-yes, he has<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7216-00000142"/> suffered in the deep dungeons of the tyrant for years; and it was there that, being alone, and without either books or any one to speak to, he first began to cultivate his voice-until he became the wonderful, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">stupendo</foreign> artist he is."</p> 
               <p>"And how did he escape?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, it is a <foreign xml:lang="ITA">gran segreto!</foreign> San Giusto is not fond of talking-he is very grand and distant in his manner-but escape he did; and whilst he was in prison, he lost the woman he adored; so that he is always melancholy, and cares for no woman. They say he has an amulet with her name on it, and that he wears it ever next his heart."</p> 
               <p>"She died of grief, then?" said Clara, deeply interested.</p> 
               <p>"Non si sa! San Giusto never talks of her, and no one even knows her name-but that is the history, for it was told me by the primo basso, Gloria, and he knows it all.</p> 
               <p>"I must hear him sing," said Clara; "with such a history, he cannot but sing to the heart."</p> 
               <p>"Clara, dear," said Zephy, twisting up to her friend, "Bayes is going-will you come?"</p> 
               <p>Bayes never staid more than an hour any where-for he wished the public, who had been admitted to a near view of his illustrious self, not to get accustomed to him, so that the idol should be found out to be made of mere common clay. So having like a meteor appeared on the literary horizon at Finchey's, like a meteor, he was about to vanish.</p> 
               <p>But Miss Finchey, in her black velvet robe, with her flowing crimson satin ribbons, and her waving ringlets, was too elated to allow her most distinguished lions to creep away noiselessly from her assembly. She determined to get all she could-particularly as neither the French actor nor the Italian tenor had made their appearance.</p> 
               <p>Bayes had more than satisfied her; he had been charming and condescending to all, and she read already, in the small journals got up principally on the mutual admiration principle, to puff into notoriety, many unknown geniuses and desponding poets, long didactic accounts of the "intellectual soire" at Miss Jessie Finch's, which her intimate friend the illustrious poet, had embellished by his presence. She had presented Harry Rushton, who arrived only just in time for that exceedingly intellectual ceremony, and nothing more, to all, who most fervently had shaken hands with the popular wit and author. She had even contrived to place the interesting Mrs. Bayes on a little tiny bit of a pedestal. Mrs. Rushton's exceeding beauty had been the object of admiration and<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7216-00000143"/> inquiry from all the unintellectual men-the others being too much occupied with themselves to give her more than a cursory glance. There was only one thing more that remained for her to draw forth-that was, to make Mrs. Rushton sing. Having done this, she was perfectly willing they should depart.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Mrs. Rushton, you are just where we want you, here by the piano. You would not think of going away without singing-surely that would be too cruel! I'm sure Mr. Rushton will allow it-though he is so chary of your voice-won't you, Mr. Rushton?"</p> 
               <p>Clara's eyes followed the direction of Miss Finch's, but Harry was nowhere to be seen; and Clara, "poor thing!" as Miss Finch observed-"who never knew how to make much of herself"--in order to avoid further importunity, hating to create a sensation, quietly opened the piano and sat down.</p> 
               <p>It was a magnificent piano-Miss Finch had persuaded an agent of a great piano manufacturer to send to her house for the season, by dint of talking and talking, and repeating to him the immense advantage it would be, for one of his pianos to be heard by <emph>all</emph> the celebrities who came to her house.</p> 
               <p>It was a way she had; and the names of her famous friends paid a good many of her bills.</p> 
               <p>The piano, therefore, was excellent. Clara passed her hands over the keys, and then, by the few chords, taken at once back into the regions of love and feeling, she sang the strain which seemed but the expression of her inward feelings- <q>
                     <l>"Ah, non credea miranti."</l>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>She sang as she had never sung before-for since last she sang, her genius had received the baptism of suffering.</p> 
               <p>She had not raised her eyes during her song, for the deep emotions of her soul, transmitted through the music, were gathering there in heavy tears. When she ceased, for an instant she sat motionless, not heeding the loud plaudits which burst from every side of the room. But at last she stood up, and a whispered "brava!" close to her ear, made her turn round. She thought it was the young Italian officer; but a far different face from his was bending its deep, searching gaze on her. The look, so mournful, the high brow, from which time had thinned the hair, the majestic repose of the features, all struck Clara with reverence and admiration; and as she raised her eyes to his, a thrill passed through her frame.</p> 
               <p>"Brava!" said the voice, again; "ma, brava!"</p> 
               <p>"Signor San Giusto," said Miss Finch,-"Mrs. Rushton. But she speaks Italian."</p> 
               <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7216-00000144"/> 
               <p>Fortunately-for San Giusto spoke most unsatisfactory English.</p> 
               <p>He addressed Clara courteously in their own language, and she listened with the most profound interest-though what he said was, of course, unimportant and insignificant-for she was thinking of his sufferings and his history, as she had that evening heard it.</p> 
               <p>The company, who had drawn round the piano, were looking on with wondering eyes and open mouths, and the ladies, with the indiscretion peculiar to their sex, were pushing and nudging each other, as they admired and wondered over the great tenor; then, clinging round the hostess, they entreated her to ask him to sing.</p> 
               <p>But Captain Ray, who had introduced him, "protested on his honor, that it would be the most ill-bred thing to ask him;" and Alessandro Alessandrini declared that an artist could not sing in such a room-there was no room for the voice to expand-then it was too low, and too warm-and then there was a carpet-and curtains-and far too many people-no artist would thus risk his reputation.</p> 
               <p>Clara overheard the discussion, and with a smile she looked up to San Giusto, and simply said,</p> 
               <p>"Sing for me!"</p> 
               <p>San Giusto paused for an instant; then sitting down in the seat Clara had vacated, in the midst of the most profound silence he sang, gazing at Clara as he sang, "Spirto gentil," in the tender, heart-rending tones of a spirit who has bidden adieu to all earthly things, and chants its last warblings on the brink of a living grave.</p> 
               <p>He sang; and the soft deep eyes, as they rested on Clara, with such tender, melancholy glances, and the tones of the voice, like echoes of a voice heard in her dreams, produced an effect upon her she could not resist; and grasping the arm nearest to her, which proved to be that of her hostess, she looked wildly around her, and then burst into tears.</p> 
               <p>She was of course led from the room. Zephy, thinking it interesting to be overcome by the music, seized her French marquis' arm, and begged to be supported to an open window; whilst Bayes, disgusted that any one had produced a greater sensation than himself, walked off with two young country poets, who returned home and improvised a sonnet a-piece, on the honor they had enjoyed-which sonnets were modestly published in the Fireside Gazette. Harry Rushton, at the first sound of Clara's voice, had disappeared-so that it was Robert Bayes and his young bride who accompanied Clara and Zephy home.</p> 
               <p>Robert Bayes, who rarely had met Mrs. Rushton-<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7216-00000145"/> for owing to Carry's residence there, he had refused all Harry's advances-was deeply impressed by her singing. He was a profound musician, both by profession and from taste.</p> 
               <p>"It is singular," said he, "how true genius and expression resemble each other. I could almost have fancied, when listening to San Giusto and yourself, that your voices were alike."</p>

               <p>MONTHS passed on. To Clara they appeared to bring but the dull monotony of day and night, succeeding each other; but to Caroline they were full of stirring events.</p> 
               <p>Moved by the potent hand of Dysart, and by his no less potent purse, her trial for divorce, charging her husband with adultery, was about to come before the public-with almost the certainty, too, that the witnesses necessary to obtain a verdict in her favor, had been secured.</p> 
               <p>Caroline, who had well understood Dysart's warning, had well fulfilled his injunctions. She had submitted with unremitting patience to be patronized, pitied and<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7216-00000146"/> preached to, she had remained in most strict retirement, and had vailed her beauty in the quietest of dress-taking care, by an under-current of intrigue and flattery, to keep up the interest of the public by almost daily articles in the papers about her injuries, her innocence, and her truth.</p> 
               <p>Still, Caroline, as she had even when under the watchful eye of her husband, contrived to do-found means to gratify her vanity and her love of intrigue; so that really, what between her lawyers and her lovers, there were few women in the United States more fully occupied than Caroline Oakwood.</p> 
               <p>Her love for Harry, which had now totally destroyed the happiness of Clara, had long since wearied her. She had a profound admiration for Clara-recognizing while she hated her superiority, her purity, her truth, and her utter sincerity. Though she knew that her husband had only succumbed, to a long series of deep-laid, wily arts on her side, no sooner had she triumphed than she scorned him, for the very facility with which he had been won-despising him and the weakness of character, the blindness, it indicated, that he should neglect and throw aside the treasure he possessed, for one like herself.</p> 
               <p>For perhaps none knew better what excellence was, than Caroline Oakwood. The admirable manner in which she herself feigned it, showed that she did.</p> 
                
               <p>But Harry's passion had increased, not diminished. It was not the deep love that he had felt for Clara-that love which had purified and elevated his nature-it was the wild passion of the senses, and led him to destruction and madness.</p> 
               <p>He was exacting, jealous-now full of remorse, now full of passion-now at Caroline's feet, worshiping her as the purest of angels-now in sullen fits accusing her of every treachery and baseness.</p> 
               <p>All this wearied Caroline; still she would not offend him just now-he had a pen, and she wanted him. So she calmed him and soothed him-consoling herself, however, with a most exciting compensation she had indulged herself in-in no less a person than the illustrious exile, Alessandro Alessandrini.</p> 
               <p>The young officer had come to Rushton's, drawn thither by the charms of Clara. But one visit convinced him that his pursuit was useless, and he turned, not without a sigh, to the more mature charms of Caroline Oakwood.</p> 
               <p>Caroline had had great curiosity to see him, from the moment she had heard that he had been the lover of Lola Montez; but when she saw him, and observed his fine, well-defined features, his redundant hair, his sparkling eyes, and his athletic form, it was not curiosity, but an ardent desire to supplant the celebrated<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7216-00000147"/> brated courtezan, which inspired her advances. With the unrefined Italian, she had no difficult talk-no delicacies of sentiment to invent, no metaphorical excuses or sophistries to bring to her assistance. He was entirely incapable of understanding the intricacies of Caroline's position; but he understood that she had taken a fancy to his person, and he thought her a sufficiently fine woman to lend himself to her caprice.</p> 
               <p>After the first ebullition of passion, he perhaps would have wearied of this intrigue the dialogue of which was carried on in very bad French on his side, and in worse on hers; but he was an exile, and loved the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">dolce far viente</foreign> for which his countrymen are proverbial; and a most elegant little perfumed sachet, having his initials embroidered on it, decided him to remain faithful to his love-for the sachet contained, besides the perfume, some most unperfumed but useful bank-notes.</p> 
               <p>"Poor fellow! his history was so touching! he was so young, and alone! Poor fellow!" said Caroline-not to herself, but to him, in reply to the scruples and thanks with which he overwhelmed her.</p> 
               <p>So immersed was Rushton in his passion for Caroline, which kept him in continued agitation, that he had scarcely felt remorse for his estrangement from Clara. But he had so respected her, that he had never feigned a love he no longer felt; and from the hour Clara, on that first night of estrangement, had found the door of his room locked, it had never been opened.</p> 
               <p>But one consolation had Clara found-that was Caroline's unwearing friendship. She had never reproached Harry-she was too proud, too sensitive for that. Would reproaches recall love? Besides, was it Harry's fault that he had ceased to love her? No-it was some fault of hers-she had not known how to retain him-she had not understood him-she was not worthy of him. Poor Harry! how he must suffer! oh, God! if he suffered as she did! Then would Clara throw herself on the floor of her room, in utter despondency and misery, her long hair floating around her, her arms extended, and her deep sobs breaking the silence of the night. There would she lie, counting over each memory of love, as a devotee counts her beads, and as at each murmured prayer, each bead of the rosary falls on the other, so all the tender memories fell one by one on her heart.</p> 
               <p>Often, then, would Caroline, with gentle and noiseless step, creep into the room, and raising her friend in her arms, try to soothe the agony which rent at once her heart and her tender frame.</p> 
               <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7216-00000148"/> 
               <p>"Oh, my beloved child," would she say, as Clara, her agony spent in showers of tears, lay pale and exhausted on a sofa, her head pillowed on the bosom of Caroline; "my own sweet, beautiful child! do not weep so piteously-do not, in the very spring of your life, deem that all hope is gone forever. No, no-Harry's love will return-I know it will. Some brief madness has seized upon him. Men are not like us, who make to ourselves an idol in our young hearts, and each year build higher and higher the wall which protects it, till there is no entrance left for any other image. Oh, Clara, have I not loved, and have I not been deceived? Yet Edgar's nature was a noble one-aye, noble as Harry's."</p> 
               <p>"And Harry's is a noble nature. Do not blame him, Caroline; never have I reproached him; I have ever tried to hide my sorrow from him."</p> 
               <p>"There I think you were wrong, dearest. Harry has a tender heart, and if he saw you now, if he knew how deeply you have felt this trouble, this incomprehensible change, pity-"</p> 
               <p>"Pity!" exclaimed Clara, starting from her friend's encircling arms; "inspire pity instead of love! Never! Reproach him-wherefore? Did reproaches ever bring back love? Sue for his love? Never! I am too proud; I am too chaste, for that. I will remain in his memory the pure woman he once loved, the mother of his Marie. They say a wife has rights that she may claim. I am no metaphysician, you know, Carry dear, but I think the wife who claims those rights, who exacts the love her husband no longer feels for her, is scarcely better than the wanton whose wretched trade it is to woo man's love, and like her she deserves to be spurned."</p> 
               <p>"But, Clara, have you never had an explanation with Harry? Has he never sought to palliate-to explain?"</p> 
               <p>"Never, Carry. When we are alone-how rarely, now, that is, you know-we talk of art, of his journal, of our friends, of you-we never speak of ourselves-scarcely even of our Marie, though he still loves her. My child! my child!" sobbed Clara, and Caroline clasped her tightly to her bosom.</p> 
               <p>Strange to say, as her victim lay in her arms, palpitating in agony, she felt no remorse at her own conduct, but increased disgust and contempt for Harry, who had yielded so weakly to her arts, and left this fair and faithful young wife to pine and die.</p> 
               <p>If Clara had never suspected Caroline to be the cause of her husband's estrangement in the beginning of his passion for her, there was little danger now of her thinking so; for Harry was now almost always away from home, and scarcely ever with Caroline.</p> 
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7216-00000149"/> 
               <p>In the middle of the night, sometimes when Clara having sobbed herself to sleep-slept a heavy sleep, with her child in her arms, scenes of violence, reproach and jealousy would take place between Harry and the now haughty and bitter Caroline. Harry, still under the charm, inthralled, surrounded by the toils she had spread around him, would always end by imploring pity and love. Irritated by Caroline, as her caprice dictated, he would tell her, clasping her knees in agony, of all the ruin she had brought on him-of the deep remorse which racked him when he gazed on Clara and on his child-he would implore her not to drive him from her, for in her presence alone he lived-away from her the furies lashed him through the world.</p> 
               <p>It was after one of these scenes of violence and wild passion, that Harry rushed from the house, and had not now for more than two days returned to it.</p> 
               <p>Clara, profoundly anxious, yet not daring openly to manifest her terror, had, however, sent to the office of the journal to inquire after her husband; but there nothing had been heard or seen of him, and on the third day a message from his partner, asking Clara if she knew where to find him, confirmed her worst fears.</p> 
               <p>Caroline, though curious to know what had become of Harry, was not at all anxious, for she cared little for his fate; and, as she drew the curtains round Clara, whose mental anxieties had now taken the form of physical suffering, she thought that the happiest thing that could occur, would be that, in a fit of insanity, Harry should have made away with himself.</p> 
               <p>"For," said Caroline, as she gently closed Clara's door, and proceeded to her own apartments; "she really is a beautiful and lovable creature, and might be made a most available friend. She would be a true and faithful one-just such a one as I should want. If she could get over this ridiculous love for Harry, and find somebody to console her-which of course she would," concluded Caroline smiling, as she opened the door of her boudoir.</p> 
               <p>There, having gained admittance to the house (clandestinely), reclining in utter ease, his large feet (large feet and hands were the penalties he paid for his athletic proportions) thrust into elaborately embroidered slippers, his coat off, his cravat on the floor beside him, lay the illustrious Alessandro Alessandrini.</p> 
               <p>He was in the act of smoking a most delicious cigar, and on a table by his side were several decanters full of wine and spirits, with tumblers, sugar, and iced water.</p> 
               <p>He was so plunged in the delights of his comfortable position, that he neither spoke nor moved as Carry entered<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7216-00000150"/> tered the room-but making, with his Italian pantomime, the sign of mixing spirits in a glass, and motioning her to come to him, moved just a little towards the wall, so as to leave room for her to sit down.</p> 
               <p>Carry, all smiles, with beaming eyes advanced and obeyed-first pushing back the redundant black locks off her lover's forehead, and imprinting her lips upon it-a caress which he bore with the serenity of a pasha.</p> 
               <p>Caroline then proceeded to manufacture the beverage required-not forgetting, when she had most artistically composed one for Alessandro, to concoct another for herself.</p> 
               <p>"That little fool is asleep at last," said Carry, in French, or the nearest approach possible to it-a language which she spoke with a broad Anglo-Saxon accent, and in which she singularly jumbled both the genders and the tenses. "I do, though, really wonder what has become of that madman."</p> 
               <p>"Madman, indeed," replied Alessandro Alessandrini, also in French, with a pure Italian idiom, lazily blowing a curling column of smoke into Caroline's face; "to leave such a beautiful creature as <foreign xml:lang="FRA">la Chiaretta.</foreign> Though I devoutly hope he may have hung himself-for he bored me considerably."</p> 
               <p>"You are not jealous of him, I hope, Alessandro? You know-"</p> 
                
               <p>"Jealous, mia cara! oh, no-I'm never jealous of an <emph>old</emph> lover; if you hadn't been tired of him, you would not have taken me."</p> 
               <p>"I wish he were as philosophical and reasonable as you, my magnificent Hercules; I assure you I have great trouble in persuading him that you are nothing to me-that you do not love me. However, he is such a fool, with his fine poetical sentiments," added Carry, shrugging her shoulders, and indulging in another caress, "that I can persuade him to any thing."</p> 
               <p>"Never again, madam!" said a voice, which made both start instantly to their feet-for it was the voice of Harry Rushton.</p> 
               <p>There he stood, so pale, so ghastly and immovable, that but for the unearthly glare of his ever extraordinarily bright eyes, the guilty Caroline might almost have thought him an avenging ghost. His dress was torn and in disorder, his voice harsh and husky.</p> 
               <p>He stood with his back leaning against the door, looking at them; and he spoke with a calmness which alarmed Caroline far more than ever his violence had done.</p> 
               <p>"Never again, madam, will you persuade me of any thing but of my guilt, my folly, and my crime. Disgrace and ruin are upon me-they are your work. Poverty, misery, await the two angels who sleep in<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7216-00000151"/> peace under this roof of crime. I am about to fly my country-perhaps terminate a worthless life. All this ruin, this destruction, is your work-yours, Caroline, whom now I find, in the very room which witnessed our guilty love, in the arms of another. Woman, I scorn you-I loathe you!-and if I die, it shall be invoking curses on your head-for you have destroyed the sweetest love, the fairest angel lent by God to earth ever inspired-and heaven knows, woman, that the love you gave me has been torture to me; from the time I first felt your burning kiss on my lips, the furies of hell have been in my heart. Look on me-look on my agonies, for the last time; and remember, great as they are, there shall come a time when you shall think of them with envy-for you shall, ere you go to meet your just punishment in the other world, feel in this all the torture you deserve-and die, spurned by every foot-your degraded form lying prostrate in the dust."</p> 
               <p>With these words, Harry, by a rapid movement, seized a glass full of wine from the table, gulped it down, and before his paralyzed auditors had yet recovered their senses, had dashed from the room.</p> 
               <p>Caroline, as he disappeared, looked towards Alessandro. He had not understood one word of the imprecations and insult Harry had heaped upon Caroline, and had only comprehended that he was desperate about something, or somebody, and complacently imagined that he was jealous of his magnificent self-so, shrugging his shoulders, with a look of pity, he returned to the sofa.</p> 
               <p>Carry then attempted a laugh of scorn, which, however, was somewhat hysterical, and then sat for some time lost in thought.</p> 
               <p>All at once she started up, and without uttering a word, went out of the room.</p> 
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="ITA">Matti tutti!</foreign> they are all mad," said Alessandro, lighting another cigar; and in a few minutes Carry returned, having perfectly recovered from her emotions, with a smile of satisfaction beaming on her face.</p> 
               <p>"See here," said she, holding up a letter to Alessandro; "see here what I have found."</p> 
               <p>"A letter," said Alessandro, taking an open letter from her hand.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, one addressed by that madman to his wife; he must have stolen in to see her, for I found this on the foot of the bed."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps he awakened her?"</p> 
               <p>"He could not well do that!" said Carry, with a meaning smile; "Clara sleeps soundly always, when <emph>I</emph> send her to sleep;" and as she spoke, Caroline drew from her pocket a small phial, upon which Alessandro,<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7216-00000152"/> as he took it from her hand, read the word, <hi rend="i"/>"Chloroform."</p> 
               <p>"Lucrezia, non Carolina," said Alessandro, as he returned the bottle, and looked at her with something of awe in his aspect.</p> 
               <p>"Not quite so bad as that! Chloroform is perfectly harmless," replied Caroline, with a smile; "and poor clara forgets all her woes when she sleeps. But if she had read that letter, you see-"</p> 
               <p>"I see nothing," said Alessandro, tossing the letter down on the table; "I cannot read your barbarous language."</p> 
               <p>"Well, he just simply tells her all that she must never know, and which would prove destruction to me and to my plans."</p> 
               <p>"Then it is better to destroy it at once," said Alessandro, taking up the letter and preparing to tear it.</p> 
               <p>"No," exclaimed Caroline, snatching it from him, "never destroy a letter so important as this. Who knows but I may want it?-not for her, but as a hold over him-for after all, he may be quietly back again to-morrow. No, no, Alessandro-a letter is like a two-edged sword-it always cuts two ways. Here, put it up in my desk-you know where. Here is the key-just open it and throw the letter in; I am so tired!"</p> 
                
               <p>Caroline with this exclamation, threw herself upon the sofa, and Alessandro, taking the key and the letter, went into the bed-room and opened the desk she had alluded to. But as he fumbled with the key, he repeated in a low tone,</p> 
               <p>"A letter is like a two-edged sword-it always cuts two ways!"</p> 
               <p>Then, having opened the desk, he looked into it for an instant, and closed it, locking it with an audible snap, whilst he quietly deposited the letter in his pocket.</p> 
               <p>Then, as it was almost daylight, Alessandro, resuming his coat, but retaining his slippers till he reached the street-door, where he put on his boots, was let out by Caroline, who, carrying the slippers up with her, sought her chamber, her bed and rest-of which indeed, she had much need.</p>

               <p>RUIN, ruin, poverty and dismay, had come indeed upon Clara. Harry returned no more-he had fled! and as he had said, had fled from disgrace-a disgrace never made public, for his partner kept his financial delinquencies in the privacy of his own office, retaining Harry's share of the paper as a compensation for his losses and his discretion.</p> 
               <p>Debts and liabilities overwhelmed Clara-more frightful to her even than to another, for she was utterly ignorant and inexperienced in the business of the world. All she understood, was, that Harry owed money, and that it was her duty to pay it-so all that poor Mary's care had secured to her darling child, the house, the furniture, the books, were immediately given to the creditors, whose claims they even then could scarcely satisfy-and Clara stood alone, friendless, penniless, with her child in her arms, in the midst of the ruins of her home.</p> 
               <p>But one friend she had-Caroline-Caroline, who took her with her to another home she had found for herself-Caroline who called her sister, and who was more than a sister to her, even at this hour, when her own fate was being decided by the laws of her adopted country.</p> 
               <p>How the world praised, exalted, and <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Io paned</foreign> this act of generosity, cannot be here set down-but the world, so loud in Caroline's praises, forgot to pity the young deserted wife. No newspaper article was even written about her, though she was the wife of an editor. Some, even Mrs. Field Close, for instance, and the sensitive Zephy, actually remonstrated with Caroline on the prudence of continuing her friendship, and retaining under her roof a woman whose husband had ran away from her; and though Clara never asked or inquired why, or cared for it-their manner was so cold and distant, that Clara, whenever they came to visit Caroline, usually retired to her own room.</p> 
               <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7216-00000154"/> 
               <p>Bayes, too, came, and closing the doors carefully, turned to Caroline with an authoritative air, and said,</p> 
               <p>"Pray, why, madam, in your present position, do you keep this Mrs. Rushton with you in direct opposition to your friends' advice?"</p> 
               <p>"I do it, sir," replied Caroline, "by my best friend's advice-by Mr. Dysart's."</p> 
               <p>"I hope he or you will account to the public for such an incomprehensible proceeding."</p> 
               <p>"Why the papers praised my generosity but last week."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; but now you see your friends think it is imprudent-having produced the effect. You see Clara is, after all, separated from her husband-and the world may begin to inquire into the cause of Harry's flight."</p> 
               <p>"And is not Clara's presence the surest way of preventing the world from attributing it to me?"</p> 
               <p>Bayes gave a low whistle, then a look of contemptuous approval, at Caroline.</p> 
               <p>"And so you <emph>were</emph> the cause! I thought so!"</p> 
               <p>"Are you jealous?" said Caroline, with a smile.</p> 
               <p>"Jealous! Ye gods! jealous of what? Of you? Fair lady, I have forgotten my ancient history-and I believe it is some ten years since 'we two parted, half broken-hearted,'" added he with a laugh. Then he resumed:</p> 
                
               <p>"And what is the world to think of this young Italian puppy, I see running tame about your house at all hours; how is his presence to be accounted for?"</p> 
               <p>"Clara," replied Caroline.</p> 
               <p>"That is the game, eh? I'm glad I understand it. Not a bad one-worthy of Dysart and you! So any stray little sin that may be found fluttering about-"</p> 
               <p>"Can settle quietly on Clara's fair shoulders."</p> 
               <p>"She is here in the capacity of scape-goat, then? Oh, Machiavellina!"</p> 
               <p>"Precisely."</p> 
               <p>"Well played!" said Bayes; "I kiss your hands;" with which metaphorical salutation he left the room.</p> 
               <p>And now the witnesses had been heard; not one had failed her, as she had said-and all had sworn to her innocence-and the two ablest counsels in the land had heaped infamy and obloquy on each others' witnesses and clients, ending by mutually abusing each other; and the jury now sat in solemn consultation, deciding on the guilt or innocence of the twain who were "but one flesh!"</p> 
               <p>It was an anxious moment, and poor Clara, drawn from her misery, sat with her friend's hands in hers, and breathed of hope; but Caroline retired to the solitude of her chamber-she said she could better bear the suspense alone; and there, between Alessandrini<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7216-00000155"/> and restoring beverages, she contrived to await with something like patience the fiat of the jury.</p> 
               <p>It came at last, and Caroline has gone to hear it-and Clara watches at the window with a beating heart, to see her-that from a first look on her return, she may know what is her friend's fate.</p> 
               <p>She comes-but not alone-she leans, pale, half-fainting, on her defender's arm, who, proudly looking round, supports her to her home. Behind her come hundreds, aye, thousands, proclaiming woman's worth, American justice, and republican chivalry; and shouts rend the air-for Edgar has been found guilty, and condemned to pay, in compensation to his noble, wronged, and exemplary victim, the greater portion of his ample fortune.</p> 
               <p>And Caroline entered her house, and the multitude shouted and clapped their hands, and Caroline's heart beat-for she had achieved the ovation she had dreamed of, on the first night of exile from her husband's roof.</p> 
               <p>Friends pressed around her-the great men of the day came up and asked Dysart to present them; and women she had never heard of, stepped from their carriages and threw themselves weepingly into her arms. Zephy, quite overcome, sat on a low stool by Caroline, looking up into her face, and then smilingly around, so that none should forget the share she had had in this great triumph of virtue-how she had supported-how she had upheld her Caroline, by her presence-aye, even in a public court. Mrs. Field Close was there, in her rigidly shabby bonnet-was she not a poor man's wife?-was she not the great poet's daughter?-did she need the distinction of a bonnet? and she explained, in a sharp, shrill voice, that both she and her mother-her admirable mother-had done their duty from the first; they knew that Mrs. Oakwood, or rather Mrs. Caroline St. Maur-for so she hoped every one would call her now-was innocent, and they had done no more than their duty.</p> 
               <p>Clara, after one hasty but truthful embrace-the only truthful and unselfish one, perhaps, which Caroline received on that day-shrinking from the crowd, retired into a distant room, where she occupied herself with Marie, and embroideries for Caroline, to whom indeed she dedicated most of her time, thinking she never could sufficiently repay her bounty and affection.</p> 
               <p>There was, however, a short respite-for even the most enthusiastic did not forget their dinner; and Alessandrini and Caroline were left alone.</p> 
               <p>"Well, mia bella," exclaimed the young Italian, "it appears that you have achieved a magnificent<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7216-00000156"/> triumph, and that in fact you are a heroine. Oh, che commedia! oh, human justice!" added he, bursting into a fit of laughter; and putting his arm round Caroline, he drew her towards him.</p> 
               <p>But she haughtily evaded his embrace, and sat down demurely on a distant chair.</p> 
               <p>"Per Bacco!" exclaimed Alessandro, suddenly stopping his mirth and standing before her, "has the jury achieved another wonder, and after persuading the world that you were a most virtuous woman, has it actually made you think so yourself?"</p> 
               <p>"What if I choose to be so?" said Caroline, offended; "you I should think, at least have no right to remind me that I have been weak towards you."</p> 
               <p>"Towards me! that's a good joke!" and Alessandro whistled a long whistle; "and how many others, mia cara? for I am not to be persuaded by a jury into disbelieving my own senses. Addio, mia cara! I'll go and see la chiaretta-you will be in a better temper soon."</p> 
               <p>Now it must be known that Alessandro had never quite got over the admiration Clara had inspired, nor had he, though he had never received the slightest encouragement, quite abandoned hope. Of late, those hopes and his passion had revived-the last inspired by his being oftener in Clara's society, the former from her lonely and dependent position-besides which, he really was a little tired of Caroline, and he thought that a little flirtation, or divertimento, as he called it, with Clara, was quite allowable.</p> 
               <p>With these thoughts all rife in his mind, he proceeded towards the sitting-room appropiated to Clara. She was weeping, and he paused in admiration before her, till she looked up at him, and hastily drying her eyes, strove to smile.</p> 
               <p>"Povera donna!" exclaimed Alessandro, sitting beside her; "always weeping, always alone! will nothing ever make you forget the ungrateful man you weep for!"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing," replied Clara, "nothing! nor do I strive to forget him; to remember him is now fortunately my duty, for it is my only pleasure. I have loved so few in the world-so few have loved me-"</p> 
               <p>"How do you know?" said Alessandro, drawing his chair nearer to her; "how do you know that there are not some who weep with you, though in secret, and who love you, oh how ardently! though in silence?"</p> 
               <p>Clara was astonished; and though she drew her chair away from him, she left the hand he had taken, passively in his hands, and looked steadily at him.</p> 
               <p>Encouraged by this, Alessandro continued:</p> 
               <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7216-00000157"/> 
               <p>"From the first hour I saw you, I adored your admirable beauty," said he, "and since, your image has not left my heart. Oh, Clara, why should you weep-you formed for love and all its pleasures-ou, whose loveliness was wasted on the vulgar churl who once possessed you?"</p> 
               <p>"Sir!" said Clara, springing from her seat, and tearing her hand from his grasp; "what means this insult? Do you forget to whom you speak, or where you are? or do you think you have still the courtezan who made you infamous, before you?"</p> 
               <p>"By Heavens!" said Alessandro, "you are more lovely than any woman I have seen; and if I have startled you, come, let me soothe you, let me show you that I am not so terrible-"</p> 
               <p>As he spoke he advanced with outstretched arms; but Clara fled before him to the door-he, however, prepared for this movement, sprang to it before her, and placing himself firmly against it, he said,</p> 
               <p>"One kiss, and you shall go, but not before, by Jupiter!"</p> 
               <p>Clara leaning on the back of a chair-for she trembled with anger at the insult-looked scornfully at him, as she said,</p> 
               <p>"I am alone; I have no husband to protect me, sir; I know it-but I am beneath a roof that should be sacred to you, for it has afforded you, an exile, a generous hospitality-but if nothing is sacred to you, I will seek her whom you have insulted by insulting me, her friend and her guest. Let me pass-I will go to Caroline-her presence will protect me."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! ah!" cried Alessandro, "to Caroline! My sweet dove, fly into the clutches of the hawk! She will protect you! Protect you! Why, child, that you are, 'tis she who has destroyed your peace! <emph>She</emph> won your husband's love-<emph>she</emph> wooed him from your arms-<emph>she</emph> sent him forth to misery and death."</p> 
               <p>"Hold, sir!" said Clara, turning from him with a scornful smile; "the story is too trite, the invention too gross-let me pass-it will not do."</p> 
               <p>"By the Holy Virgin!" exclaimed Alessandro, "but I speak the truth! See, I can give you proof-do you know this handwriting?" and taking Rushton's letter, which Caroline had purloined, he held it towards her.</p> 
               <p>"Harry's-it is Harry's writing!" exclaimed Clara, eagerly seizing it and devouring its contents. There were but a few lines, written as on the brink of the grave. He spoke not of his love for her, but he told her of all his deep reverence, and he implored her to love his child-and then, in few words, he told her of his wild, guilty passion, revealed what Caroline was,<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7216-00000158"/> and bid her fly far, far from the deadly embrace of the woman who had caused their misery.</p> 
               <p>Clara read all, and then, still holding the letter, she looked towards Alessandro, and muttered,</p> 
               <p>"Is it true?"</p> 
               <p>"True as our immortal salvation," said Alessandro; "by my patron saint I swear it."</p> 
               <p>Then Clara's whole form seemed suddenly transformed to stone; the eyes fixed and immovable, the arms stiffened, the cheeks, the lips, so pale,-the heaving bosom alone told of life.</p> 
               <p>Alessandro spoke to her, but she replied not; he extended his hand to take the letter from her, and then she started, and crushing up the letter, held it tightly in her hand; then, waving him aside, like one walking in a dream, she passed from the room.</p> 
               <p>"Per Bacco!" said Alessandro, "I've done some mischief, I'm afraid! Ah, bah! I don't much care, after all."</p> 
               <p>Still it was not without some anxiety that he waited, during the evening, for Clara's appearance, but she came not-nor did Caroline, again surrounded by adulating and congratulating friends, and accustomed, too, as she was, ever to find Clara when she wanted her, but rarely to see her when engaged with society, notice her absence.</p> 
                
               <p>At length the company had disappeared, and the mental intoxication in which she had been since the morning, began to subside; and suddenly turning from the mirror before which she usually stood for some minutes, whenever she was alone, she turned round to Alessandro and exclaimed,</p> 
               <p>"Where is Clara?"</p> 
               <p>"How should I know?" replied Alessandro, with a shrug.</p> 
               <p>"Ring the bell," said Caroline, "and inquire."</p> 
               <p>The servant who obeyed the summons, entered with a letter in his hand.</p> 
               <p>"Where is Mrs. Rushton?" said Caroline.</p> 
               <p>"Out, madam, but she left this letter for you;" and the servant, giving Clara's letter, withdrew.</p> 
               <p>Caroline opened the envelope with composure and indifference; but the blood mounted to her temples as she recognized within it Rushton's letter to Clara, without one word from herself.</p> 
               <p>Caroline tottered to a seat, and passed her hand over her forehead.</p> 
               <p>Clara knew all; she was in her power! Where was she gone? Perhaps to destroy her forever-perhaps to-morrow she might be hooted, as to-day she had been cheered. Was she foiled at last, and by a child?</p> 
               <p>Alessandro sat perfectly still, apparently occupied<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7216-00000159"/> with a newspaper; but he looked from behind it on Caroline, expecting every instant an outburst of jealousy.</p> 
               <p>"How came she by the letter?" said Caroline, aloud; then, all at once her brow cleared, and pressing the letter to her lips, she exclaimed, "what matters where or how she obtained it? I have it now! Poor, silly fool! she has no proof-who will believe her? No, all is safe-ah! ah! simpleton! to return the letter! Well, Heaven speed her, wherever she may be! Perhaps she may find Rushton and then-oh, Alessandro, after all, this is an easy world to manage-there are so many fools in it!"</p>

               <p>"HEAVEN speed poor Clara!" had Caroline in mockery said; but she had great need of Heaven's protection, as, her half-sleeping Marie in her arms, she issued with a firm step and throbbing temples, from the only roof which she had now to shelter her.</p> 
               <p>Stunned by the letter, all her love for Harry revived, as she read the soul-harrowing words. Bewildered at Caroline's treachery, it was not reason which dictated her conduct. Instinctively, without analyzing either feelings, motives, or sensations, she felt an intense desire to fly from all she had ever known-a desperate, insensate wish to go, she knew not whither-but to snatch up her child and rush from where she was. Wrapping a shawl around her, and putting on a common straw bonnet, that lay in her<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7216-00000160"/> way, she took up the sleeping Marie, and silently put on her clothes-then lulling her in her arms, with her eyes dry and distended, her cheek pale, her lip quivering, but with a firm, quick step, she hurried from the house.</p> 
               <p>It had been long dark when she issued into the street, but she observed it not, but went straight on before her. Marie, her arms round her mother's neck, and her head leaning on her shoulder, looked quietly up at the stars, and talked in a murmuring tone to them, till she fell asleep-and still Clara walked, neither thinking of the past, nor of Caroline, nor of Harry, distinctly, nor even of the burthen, so heavy for her slender frame, she carried in her arms. A supernatural strength seemed to be given to her-a supernatural power to inspire her. On, on she wandered, turning at every impediment she met, either to the right or to the left. The streets grew silent; the sound of all wheels ceased, and the footsteps of a few late passengers hurrying home, echoed along the pavement. The lamps were extinguished, too, and the moon was up high in the heavens, in all her brightness; and through its pale rays passed the dark shadow of Clara, bearing her sleeping child.</p> 
               <p>At last-it was in a quiet, silent little street, with small gardens in front of the houses-her limbs tottered under her, her trembling arms refused any longer to support the sleeping child, and Clara, clutching instinctively at the iron railing, entered mechanically one of the open gates, and dragging herself and her child with a last effort along, she sank with a deep gasp, on the steps of the door.</p> 
               <p>There she sat-Marie, sleeping, extended on her knees-there she sat, her burning eyeballs turned up to the stars, her mind still in the unconscious trance which had bound her now for so many hours. Suddenly, a shadow came between her and the stars, and a soft voice fell with a dull, unmeaning sound upon her ear.</p> 
               <p>Still she was not conscious, and unresistingly she allowed herself to be raised from the ground and carried into the house.</p> 
               <p>Gently she was laid on a sofa, but she resisted not; then an effort was made to take Marie from her arms, and straining her to her heart, her consciousness returned, and she looked wildly around her.</p> 
               <p>Tender, compassionate eyes were bent on her; there was a large-featured but kind-looking face, of a middle-aged woman, close to hers, and opposite to her, gazing at her intently, stood the tall figure of a man whose majestic and melancholy mien appeared to recall some distant memory to her heart.</p> 
               <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7216-00000161"/> 
               <p>As she gazed on him, he spoke, and his words were in her own Italian-not in the cold, harsh language which had broken her heart. Their sound melted the hard, burning sorrow which had pressed upon her heart and brain, and she wept.</p> 
               <p>Exhausted by the sobs which seemed to tear her frame, she lay for some time in a state of insensibility; till the wailing of her child aroused her, and she feebly raised herself on her elbow and looked around her. The child lay in the arms of the noble looking stranger, whose features appeared familiar to her-and now, her senses more collected, she remembered him. It was the tenor, San Giusto; and she was about to rise and go to him, who was still rocking the murmuring infant to and fro; but he began, in a low voice, to sing, <q>
                     <l>"La biondina in gondoletta!"</l>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Then there came to Clara's heart a sudden pang, and her dead mother came before her. But rapidly even that image passed away, and the strange visions of the blue sea, and the white sails, and the marble terraces, arose before her-and then, as she gazed on San Giusto, as he bent down to her child, the memory of the being she remembered bending down to her in the land she thus recalled, came before her-and noiselessly lessly she started to her feet, and breathlessly sweeping back the long hair from her brow, she stood and listened.</p> 
               <p>And still he rocked the child, and still he sang, till coming to the end of the first part, he ended with the low soft cadence with which her mother had so often hushed her.</p> 
               <p>Then, with one wild bound, springing forward, and extending her hand towards him, to impose silence, she stood erect before him; and as he looked, in mute astonishment at her, she took up the second part of the air- <q>
                     <l>"La dormiva in sto braccie,"</l>
                  </q> with all the turns and wild variations her mother was wont to give it.</p> 
               <p>Her voice was clear, distinct and steady, and appeared to penetrate the soul; and as she sang, San Giusto's frame trembled, and his pale cheek became paler still-and putting down the child, as she finished, he exclaimed,</p> 
               <p>"Who are you?"</p> 
               <p>Clara replied not; but drawing from her hand the silver ring her dying mother had given to her, she extended it towards him; then, sinking on her knees, her little child, who in alarm had ran towards her,<pb n="322 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7216-00000162"/> closely strained to her heart, she knelt breathlessly and silently before him.</p> 
               <p>San Giusto uttered a smothered exclamation as he first touched the ring; then, rushing up to the light, he eagerly examined the interior. There the initials love had engraven and time had not effaced, became visible to him, and wildly he pressed the ring to his lips, and turning to Clara, he in a scarcely audible voice, murmured,</p> 
               <p>"Ginevra, my wife! Where is she?"</p> 
               <p>"In heaven with God," replied Clara, solemnly.</p> 
               <p>San Giusto sank into a seat, and buried his face in his hands, whilst his manly frame shook with emotion, and his bosom heaved.</p> 
               <p>Still Clara knelt, and still breathlessly she gazed on him. Suddenly he raised his head, and dashing the tears from his eyes, he turned towards Clara, exclaiming in trembling accents,</p> 
               <p>"And Chiaretta, my daughter, where is she?"</p> 
               <p>"At your feet, my father!" shrieked Clara; and the father and daughter were in each other's arms.</p>

               <p>WHEN Caroline felt she had attained, through such a dangerous pathway, and so many perils, the pinnacle of her ambition, it must be confessed that, spite of her self-possession, her heartlessness, it made her somewhat giddy; and though perhaps the jury had not convinced her that she was a virtuous woman, still she was led into the error that, under the gis of her country's verdict, she might with impunity pursue what conduct she pleased, for that all would be imputed to pure and noble motives.</p> 
               <p>The ovation she had received, the public plaudits, the private homage, which had followed this event, had been the consummation of a whole life. Now Caroline, who had deeply studied the world, knew that after<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7216-00000164"/> so great an excitement, the public enthusiasm would evaporate, and Mrs. Caroline St. Maur be very quietly forgotten in less time than the jury had taken to deliberate on their celebrated verdict.</p> 
               <p>But Caroline had not toiled all her life for so short and meteoric a triumph-her friends imagined the victory she had obtained to have been what she, as well as themselves, had been fighting for-and each came with plans, proposals, and advice as to how she was best to establish herself on the splendid income the law had allowed her.</p> 
               <p>But Caroline was no longer to be advised-nor did she listen either humbly or deferentially, to Bayes, or to any of those who had formerly patronized her. She was about to withdraw from their patronage, and she wanted them no longer.</p> 
               <p>To obtain her liberty had been not the aim of Caroline's ambition, but merely a preliminary step to a life of excitement and triumph which she had marked out for herself. Caroline had resolved to go on to the stage-that was the only sphere in which her craving vanity could find its daily food; and for this had she toiled, and intrigued, and worked, making mere tools and puppets of those who had assisted her, and who in upholding her, had imagined they were serving the cause of modesty and virtue, when in fact they had only been helping a vain woman to step at once from the monotonous weariness of commonplace and hateful duties, to the most conspicuous position on the stage.</p> 
               <p>Scarcely was it known that such was Caroline's determination, before engagements were offered her on every side. Caroline, the object of intense public curiosity, was a sure card, at least till that curiosity should be satisfied. Then, she was a handsome woman, and she might have talent; but that was of very little importance to them, though to her it might be, for on that fact depended her maintaining her position as a star, even after the motives which led them to engage her should have ceased.</p> 
               <p>And so, at one of the most attractive theatres of New York, the most virtuous woman of the United States-she who had suffered such wrong from the brutality of an actor and the associations of the stage-she who by a chivalric public had been restored to dignity and privacy-made, certainly to the amazement of many, her first appearance before a house, crowded as never house had been before, and achieved before this second jury what she had done before the first-an overwhelming and complete triumph.</p> 
               <p>All appeared to go well with Caroline; and, as she beheld the enormous sum put into her hands<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7216-00000165"/> the next morning, as the result of the last evening's labors, as the manager called it-pleasure, she called it-she smiled with contempt at the paltry sum respectability had given her, and laughed at the friends who tried, with grave faces, to point out to her the <emph>sinfulness</emph> of her ways.</p> 
               <p>Now, strange to say, of all her friends, Mrs. Field Close was the least severe; she even appeared to live so much out of the world as to be ignorant of Carry's debut; and on her next visit to her, never even referred to the stage.</p> 
               <p>One morning Mrs. Field Close was announced at an unusually early hour, and was ushered into Caroline's bed-room, where she was still in bed.</p> 
               <p>Her aspect was very serious-she looked even thinner and paler than ever; and her voice, though subdued, was sharper than before, and yet, one subject of irritation had been removed from the highly respectable home of Mrs. Field Close-Mr. Field Close had gone to Europe on a literary tour.</p> 
               <p>"Well, my dear Lousia," said Caroline, assuming in her turn, on the strength of her money and her virtue, somewhat of a patronizing tone; "well, how have you prospered?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dearest Carry," replied Louisa, with considerable deference in her tone, "the vase is most beautiful ful, and the inscription looks quite the thing-my father even approves of it; but-"</p> 
               <p>"But what?" said Caroline; "there can be no obstacles, I imagine."</p> 
               <p>"No, but-"</p> 
               <p>"Why, my dear Louisa," said Caroline, with a laugh, "you can have no catastrophe to relate with regard to a silver vase. Did you not first propose that a vase should be offered by the ladies of New York to Mr. Dysart, as a token of gratitude for his admirable defence of a virtuous and unprotected woman?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly."</p> 
               <p>"And is not the vase finished?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"And is not a beautiful and simple inscription engraven on it?"</p> 
               <p>"There is."</p> 
               <p>"Were not the ladies, I know not how many, ready to pay down their subscriptions?"</p> 
               <p>"They were."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, how much does the vase cost?"</p> 
               <p>"One hundred and fifty dollars."</p> 
               <p>"And how much have you received?"</p> 
               <p>"Five dollars from Mrs. Bayes," said Mrs. Field Close, "and my humble mite," modestly putting on to<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7216-00000166"/> the white counterpane a shining silver half-dollar. "I am poor-I do not deny it," said Louisa; "I am a wife and a mother, and the daughter of the great poet of America; but I am poor, and I give all I can."</p> 
               <p>"So," said Caroline, "public sympathy has oozed quickly out at its purse-strings! and so, after making a great fuss, and asking Dysart if he would accept it, and puffing the ladies through all the papers, the thing falls to the ground! and this is the very day on which it is to be presented, and Dysart will wait and-ridiculous!"</p> 
               <p>"But, Carry-"</p> 
               <p>"And that little fool Zephy, with her patronzing airs, is coming, too, this morning to go with you-it is preposterous! She gave <emph>the</emph> five dollars, I suppose?"</p> 
               <p>"She did."</p> 
               <p>"What is to be done, eh, Louisa?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, Carry dear, you know there is but one difficulty-that is, money; now if we have money to get the vase out of Ball and Black's hands-"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes-go on."</p> 
               <p>"Well then, you see, neither the jewelers, nor the ladies, nor Dysart, need know where it comes from-for the ladies will be sure not to make any confidences to each other-and I, Carry, you know my principles, you have nothing to fear from me. If you can find the money-"</p> 
                
               <p>"Here, quick, Louisa; your plan is capital, just open the top drawer-give me the roll of bills you will find there."</p> 
               <p>Louisa hastened to obey, and quickly from the roll of notes the two ladies counted out one hundred and fifty dollars, which Louisa, after again counting them over, put into her pocket.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, money!" exclaimed she, with a profound sigh, "how much does it not achieve! Oh, you are a happy woman! whilst I-I cannot even help those I love!" and Louisa applied her handkerchief to her eyes.</p> 
               <p>"What is the matter, Louisa?" said Carry, understanding she was expected to inquire.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, nothing-and yet, why should I not tell you, my friend, whom I have upheld through all her sorrows? Poor Field-"</p> 
               <p>"Well?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, he is obliged to return-"</p> 
               <p>"So soon?"</p> 
               <p>"Alas, yes! He has no funds to go further. Yes, he must return without seeing the beautiful Italy he has yearned all his life to behold."</p> 
               <p>"And how much would it require?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no matter-more than I can raise-well," and<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7216-00000167"/> again she wiped her eyes; "it is, perhaps, for the best-but Field's letter was heart-rending."</p> 
               <p>"Do tell me how much it would require," said Caroline, fully aware of how the conversation would end.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, an enormous sum-five hundred dollars!" and at this, Mrs. Field Close sobbed outright.</p> 
               <p>"Here," said Carry, putting the remainder of the roll of notes into Louisa's hands; "here, take this-there are exactly five hundred dollars-send them to your husband-oh, never thank me! I can make that in an evening-that is pleasant after all," and Caroline, lying in state on her pillows, suffered the humble and grateful Mrs. Field Close, to take her hand-and kiss it!</p> 
               <p>And now Mrs. Bayes was announced-she would not come up-she was come merely for Mrs. Close-and so Mrs. Close hurried away, with many protestations and innumerable expressions of gratitude.</p> 
               <p>"So," said Carry, as she saw her shut the door, "that is the price of your patronage. Well, five hundred dollars' worth of respectability have done a great deal for me! Thank Heaven, I've done with it all now, forever!"</p> 
               <p>And she was right-for this was the last she ever saw of her respectable friends and patrons.</p>

               <p>CARLO SAN GIUSTO was the only son of a widowed mother. His father, one of the remnants of old patrician families of Venice, had retained but little of the wealth of his ancestors, beyond the grand old palace, with its deeply arched porticoes and balconies, under the shadow of which loitered and sang the idle gondolier. No longer in his splendid and showy livery-but still proudly bearing, at the prow of his gondola, the flag with the armorial bearings of the house of San Giusto.</p> 
               <p>The Count San Giusto was living peaceably in that negative state of happiness accorded by the Austrian government, which consists in ignorance and inactivity, when Napoleon, with his dazzling victories,<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7216-00000168"/> crossed the Alps, arousing, from its torpid state, the dormant spirit and warlike insticts of the Italians.</p> 
               <p>San Giusto joined the Italian brigade, and before the meteor, which had dazzled him from his home, had set in the storm-clouds which finally obscured it, he himself lay extended, dead, on the plains of Leipsic.</p> 
               <p>He left a widow and an only son, both of whom, not badly provided for, in a country where so little of the wealth for which the world toils, brings happiness; but utterly isolated from the world and all ties of kindred-for they were the last of their race.</p> 
               <p>Carlo was by his mother sent to the university of Pavia; and there, whilst becoming one of the most distinguished scholars, he became also one of the most active promoters and supporters of the secret societies, which were germinating amongst the youth of that day, even in the very onset of their career-sending forth so many from the halls of learning and intellect, to the close walls of the narrow prisons of tyranny and fanaticism.</p> 
               <p>Carlo San Giusto, however, no sooner left college, than he formed one of those sudden passions, which in others countries are but evanescent dreams, but which, in a country whence all serious thoughts, aspirations, and ambitions are banished, become the destiny of those whose every faculty they inthrall.</p> 
                
               <p>Ginevra Ferrari was but just returned from her convent, when her soft, dark eyes, half shaded by the black lace vail which enveloped her, encountered the glance of San Giusto, as at the door of Santa Maria Maggiore, he handed her the holy water, making, at the same time as herself, the sign of the cross-consecrating, as it were, their meeting by the sacred words which they both uttered.</p> 
               <p>And they loved. Both were young-neither had known care or crime. He had no ambition, she no vanity. Ginevra was not rich, neither was San Giusto-but he had enough for a life of quiet retirement-enough to keep away the sordid anxieties of the world, and all dread for the future; and so, no obstacle intervening, with the blessing of San Giusto's mother, and the approval of Ginevra's family, they were married.</p> 
               <p>For years no change came to these happy beings. Living unknown to the world, in the enjoyment of all the peace of a holy life, in which gentleness and love led to acts of charity and piety, these two fortunate creatures glided through existence, from year to year, as smoothly as their own gondolas on their lagunes, where side by side, their beautiful Chiaretta between them, they so often sailed beneath the bright moonlight and the quiet stars. Here often would Ginevra's<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7216-00000169"/> voice lull the sweet child of their idolatry, with the national songs of her country-or San Giusto, whose magnificent tones were known all over the lagunes, to the sound of his guitar, would sing some more complicated strains.</p> 
               <p>Or, on their high-terraced balcony, filled with fragrant, blooming orange flowers, would they sit-the aged grandmother and the young matron, on household works intent, her husband stretched at her feet, deep in some poet's verse-while the fair sprite, the idol of all, would flit around, now going to one, and now to another, till lured by its caresses, its playful advances, and its gay laugh, the young father would throw down his book, and join in the gambols of his darling-reaching for her the high fruits or the gay blossoms, or holding her in his arms and pointing out to her, in the far off horizon of the deep blue sea, the tiny sails, which like message-birds to some happier land, seemed ever to be lost in the misty clouds.</p> 
               <p>Such was the infancy, the happy infancy, which Clara's struggling memory so often sought to recall. Her father, one by one, evoked the past; and then, when Clara had recounted the sad and terrible scenes, whose misery and utter change had so driven back the brighter recollections, that they were but as dreams, then, in low whispered accents, the daughter had told her father all she knew of the long-sufferings of her mother. She told him how, straining her child in her arms, invoking the husband of her youth, whose image still dwelt in her heart, her mind straying back to her own bright land and happy days, on a wretched and miserable pallet she had died.</p> 
               <p>Then, as with wild sobs her father snatched her to his arms, Clara, winding her arms round him, and resting her head on his bosom, looked up inquiringly, and asked how was it that, thus alone and far from him, their mother had died.</p> 
               <p>The story that he told, and strove to link with the unhappy fate of his Ginevra, was something of that which Alessandro Alessandrini, by a strange coincidence, had on the first night of his meeting Clara, told her as the story of the tenor San Giusto.</p> 
               <p>In the midst of the quiet happiness which we have described, one of San Giusto's college friends, whose name had often resounded in various political meetings and attempts at insurrection, came to Venice. Their intimacy was renewed. Ercole Frasi had spent the years which his friend had passed in domestic quiet, in the wild tumult of the political and artistic life of the French capital. He became deeply imbued with the poetical idea of all politicians, the regeneration of Italy. All the enthusiasm which had made San Giusto<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7216-00000170"/> one of the hopes of the society of "La Giovane Italia," revived, and he was soon one of the principal movers of an insurrection, planned by men utterly ignorant of the world, utterly ignorant of the science of politics, or the world, utterly ignorant of the science of politics, or the history of the cabinets of their own times. A conspiracy conducted by such conspirators, with nothing but the two elements utterly inimical to all successful revolt-courage and enthusiasm-was sure to fail.</p> 
               <p>The Austrian government, which had from the first known of these secret meetings, waited until all the principal members being assembled, the police quietly entered, and without a struggle, they were arrested; and before either friends of families knew of their fate, they were already tried, condemned, and confined in the deep an unknown dungeons of the Austrian prisons.</p> 
               <p>Ercole Frasi, with his experience and coolness, had contrived to escape; and flying to San Giusto's house, was the first to announce to the terrified wife and mother, the fatal news. The visit of the police to their home, the confiscation of all they possessed, soon confirmed their worst fears.</p> 
               <p>Madame San Giusto was seized with a sudden paralysis, and in a few days consigned to the family tomb-all that now remained of their family possessions.</p> 
               <p>Ginevra, by the advice and aid of Ercole, fled with her child to Genoa. He dared not aid her openly; but there he promised to meet her, adding mysterious words, which led her to imagine that there too she would find her husband.</p> 
               <p>There, bewildered by sorrow, fear and agony, the young wife heard, from the lips of one to whom in her helplessness she looked for protection and help, that San Giusto had fled from his prison, and without daring even to leave a word that might betray him, or compromise her, had embarked at Genoa, and sailed for America.</p> 
               <p>To America instantly Ginevra resolved to go-but Ercole found excuses after excuses, and numerous causes of delay-till at length he offered to the beautiful and innocent creature who had so deeply trusted him, love and protection for herself and child-insinuating that San Giusto had been faithless, and had gone to the new world with another.</p> 
               <p>Indignantly the true and tender woman spurned both the base insinuation, and the passion which had dictated it; but, believing that San Giusto had indeed escaped to the land of the free, she fled from the deceitful protection of her perfidious friend, and embarked with her child, in a small merchant vessel, bound for New York.</p> 
               <p>Some years later, when San Giusto, freed by the devotion of the jailor of his prison, arrived in Paris,<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7216-00000171"/> Ercole Frasi, in answer to his despairing inquiries, and suddenly overcome by pity and remorse, revealed the fate of Ginevra, as far as he knew it.</p> 
               <p>San Giusto, who as rumor said, had in his prison so cultivated his talents as to become the greatest tenor of his day, was then fulfilling a most profitable engagement at the Italian opera in Paris; but without waiting to terminate it, he accepted an offer made to him by an Impressario of the United States, and came to America, in the wild hope of discovering all that the world contained for him to love.</p> 
               <p>He dreaded to think what must be the sufferings and perils of his sweet, simple-minded wife, unaccustomed utterly to the rude contact of the world, who had come from the quiet walls of a convent to her husband's arms. Ginevra, his Ginevra, who had never been further alone than from her home to the church-ignorant, utterly ignorant, too, of the language spoken in the country in which she was a stranger, and alone with a young and helpless child.</p> 
               <p>Whatever were her sufferings, and perhaps they exceeded even the terrible imaginings of her agonized husband, they were never known in their full extent, to any on earth. They lie buried in her unknown pauper grave, over which the two sole affections of her life, united now, cannot even weep-for no stone has marked the spot, where by rude hands, she was forever laid.</p>

               <p>CLARA'S history was now all that remained to be told to her father. Briefly she hurried over the terrible events which during the last two years of her life, had snatched her from a state of unmixed happiness, and brought her almost to the verge of madness.</p> 
               <p>But lingering with fond delay over every detail of love and affection, did Clara relate Mary's tenderness, telling San Giusto that the daughter now restored to him, whom he so adored, and of whom each day he grew so proud, was the work of her protecting care.</p> 
               <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7216-00000172"/> 
               <p>Without her, what might she not have been! a wanderer in the streets-an inhabitant of the dens of misery and vice! As he thought of this, and gazed on the lovely and gifted creature, all his own, deep and profound feelings of gratitude filled his heart. But Mary was rich and happy-he could do nothing for her, but in a letter express the profound and ardent gratitude he felt-rewarding Mary's past care and affection, by telling her of her darling's safety, and of the bright prospects which had dawned upon her.</p> 
               <p>Then the happy father, with minute and persevering research, sought out Mistress Judy Mullens-she who had closed his Ginevra's eyes, and rescued his Clara from public charity.</p> 
               <p>The search was long and difficult; but large rewards to the police officers, and continued advertisements in the public papers, at length brought Mrs. Judy Mullens, on the tenter-hooks of expectation, to know what was the "something" she would hear to her advantage, into the presence of the child she had launched on the world's stage, as a "match-girl."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Judy had grown a good deal older, and a great deal stouter, and somewhat more rubicund. Her taste nor her tidiness had not improved; but the ample and expanded face wore the same expression of kindness and good nature, showing that, however the world might have treated Mrs. Mullens, Mrs. Mullens was ever disposed to treat the world and all its faults with charity and indulgence. In one respect, however, fate had been kind to Mrs. Judy Mullens-for Mrs. Judy Mullens was a widow-the whiskey-bottle having long since disposed of Johnny.</p> 
               <p>And there she stood, as she afterwards herself related it, thousands of times, to wondering listeners, curtesying and curtesying, first to the grand-looking gentleman, who sat in a grand chair, with a purty babby on his knee, a-playing with a grand gold watch-chain as thick as her thumb-and then a-curtesying to a young lady as stood leaning on the chair a-trembling, like, so pale, but so beautiful, and a looking at her, so-so-loving, and so earnest, that the tears came into Judy's eyes, and she felt a kind of all-overishness!</p> 
               <p>"And nobody spake to me," continued Judy, "but the grand-looking gentleman said jist a few words in a foreign lingo to the beautiful lady, and she didn't answer at all, at all-but just bowed her head to him, and still kept a-looking steadily at me. At last she opens her purty little mouth, and in a trimbling voice,</p> 
               <p>"'Judy,' says she, 'Judy Mullens?'</p> 
               <p>"'That same, milady,' says I-for she was so grand and purty, that I jist called her milady, unbeknown to myself, like in the old country-'that same, marm, the widdy of Johnny Mullens.'</p> 
               <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7216-00000173"/> 
               <p>"With this, she makes but one jimp from the chair where she was a standing, up to me, and throwing her arms round my neck, she hugs and kisses me, and then, looking up to me, while the tears was a running like rain down her face,</p> 
               <p>"'Matchees! matchees!' says she-and thin I knewed it all; and I knew the sweet, sayrious eyes agin-and I gived a little scream, and I felt my heart jimp into my mouth. 'Clary,' says I, 'and is it ye agin!' and so, all grand and purty as she was, in her fine silks and laces, I squeezed her up in me owld arms, and falling down on to a fine sofy, jist took her on my knees, and hugged her and kissed her, no more nor less thin a child."</p> 
               <p>Then Mrs. Mullens would tell the adventures of the poor furrin "lady" (as she called her now), and the haps and mishaps of Clara and Johnny, and her own progeny-all mixed up in hopeless confusion. Till at last she would tell how the grand gintleman, Clara's father, had kissed her hand, as though she were a queen, and had made her a long spache in his heathin tongue-and thin Clara had asked her after the baby she had nursed-and that when Mrs. Judy said the baby was a fine good boy, as was a scholar, and earned his two dollars a week in a store, though he was but a bit of a lad-Clara and the grand gentleman had looked at each other and nodded, and then, two days afterwards, they had taken her, Mrs. Judy and Terence-the "baby," as Miss Clara-Mrs. Rushton she meant-called him, in their own carriage, and brought them to the store-the fine corner grocery where they were now sitting-and had told them that it was all their own-Mrs. Judy Mullens', and after her, all belonged to Terence, for iver and iver, furniture, and stock, and house, jist as it was.</p> 
               <p>"'And,' says Clara, 'Judy mammy,' for all the world as she used to do, 'here is a little basket, like the one you put the matches in, and it's got something for ye to remimber the match-girl with, in it-and Judy dear,' says she, 'when one comes a begging to your door, be kind to them, for your Clara's sake.'</p> 
               <p>"And I looked in the basket, and there was this fine watch, and a gold chain, you see, and a fine prescription, as Terence calls it-ye can read it-</p> 
               <p>"'To Judy Mullens, in remembrance of her love and charity for the match-girl.'</p> 
               <p>"And I wear it always," said Mrs. Mullens, rocking herself in an ample rocking-chair; "for I don't do no hard work now, but jist sits in my store and sarves the customars; and I lets lodgings, for I don't want the other floors-and Terence kapes the books-and I help the other childer, bad as they was to their<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7216-00000174"/> old mother-for you see I've money in the bank, and Terence puts more and more every month, for he's a scholar, and some of the goodness of Miss Clary must have got into him, when she used to hug him and sing to him, when he was a babby. God bless her! she's got a beautiful babby of her own, now, and I love it as if it was mine."</p> 
               <p>This one happy event, and the sight of Judy Mullens' delight, had appeared to rouse Clara from the state of melancholy into which, after the few first days of her reunion with her father, she had fallen.</p> 
               <p>San Giusto, who had made a rapid fortune, surrounded his daughter with every care and every luxury, and strove to divine her wishes and her tastes, that he might gratify them. But Clara had neither wishes nor tastes-her very heart seemed to slumber; and the caresses of her father and child drew from her but a gentle, sickly smile,-a sort of nervous sensibility took possession of her; she would start at any unexpected noise, and the sound of the door-bell, or an unknown voice, would make her frame tremble from head to foot. Gradually she secluded herself from all; and the very sight of the streets appeared to inspire her with horror. At home, her blinds were invariably closed; and when, at the entreaty of her father, she would consent to drive out with him and little Marie, she would close her eyes as they traversed the city, lest some familiar face or some well-known street, should meet her view.</p> 
               <p>San Giusto was in despair. Well versed in the heart's experiences, he knew that his child pined for the father of her child-for Harry-for her only love. Secretly he made inquiries as to the fate of Rushton, but nothing could he learn excepting a vague report that he had gone to Australia-but so vague was this report, that he did not even dare to communicate it to Clara.</p> 
               <p>Besides the love, for which in truth she pined, Caroline's treachery, and the baseness of which she had been the victim, had given Clara's noble and generous nature so severe a shock as to have produced a misanthropic, morbid distaste and disdain for the world. Her bruised spirit sought for nothing now but solitude and rest. Day by day she faded. San Giusto, in despair, consulted all the first physicians of New York-but all silently withdrew, for none could minister to a mind diseased.</p> 
               <p>At length San Giusto bethought himself that an utter change of scene would perhaps arouse Clara from the state of hopeless apathy into which she had fallen; and remembering the deep affection she expressed<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7216-00000175"/> pressed and felt for Mary, he resolved to take her within the influence of scenes and affections that could recall no bitter memories.</p> 
               <p>His present engagement being terminated, he resolved to quit the stage forever.</p> 
               <p>Without consulting Clara, he made all the necessary preparations-writing to Mary to apprize them of their coming; and then, with his darling Marie, they sailed for England.</p> 
               <p>Clara, as she lost sight of the American coast, appeared to breathe again freely. She smiled, too, cheerfully, and her happy father saw gradually the color return to her cheek, and listened with delight to her anticipations of her meeting with one who had been to her a second mother.</p> 
               <p>As she set foot upon English ground, Mary's gentle and serious face smiled on hers-she had come to meet her child and her child's child, and to welcome them to her own native land.</p> 
               <p>San Giusto gave his daugther to her arms, and then, as he poured fourth, day after day, his deep gratitude to Mary for her care and love, he learned to know Mary's high and noble mind, her gentle spirit, her patience, and her loving heart, and wondered no more that he had found his own sweet Clara so perfect and so good.</p> 
                
               <p>Mary's home was in one of the southern counties of England. There, the lady of the manor of one of the large villages in Devonshire, she could exercise her spirit of charity and usefulness, the two things to which she devoted now her life. Her father had not long survived his return to England; and Clara, who came just after his decease, to fill up the solitude of her home, was doubly welcome.</p> 
               <p>To Mary did Clara reveal all the anguish she had endured since they had parted-and Mary's affectionate sympathy, her piety, her sad experiences of the heart's sorrows, soothed away the bitter, rankling feelings of disdain and disgust, which all the miserable vice and treachery she had been the victim of, had implanted in Clara's heart.</p> 
               <p>She learned to pity, she strove to forgive, those who had so wantonly destroyed her happiness; and soon she forgot to dwell on her injuries, and even Caroline faded, in the calm influences which now surrounded her, and the bitterness passed from her heart. But purified, patient, trusting, the love for her absent, erring Harry arose from the healthful soil. She knew not where he had fled, but she felt that he lived. Not one word of his fate had ever reached her ear-but she felt that the brief fever of passion for Caroline was banished forever, and that he loved her again.<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7216-00000176"/> And she knew, too, that he would return; she knew not when-it might be to-morrow, it might not be for years-but return he would; and secretly she shaped all the actions of her life, all her projects, as though she knew he would be ere long there to share them-and she spoke to her Marie of her father, who loved her, and who was coming.</p> 
               <p>"When?" said the child. Her mother knew not; but he would come-and patiently, undoubtingly, Clara smiled, and loved, and waited.</p>

               <p>MARY'S home was one of those habitations, deeply embowered in trees, sheltered by hills and surrounded by smooth lawns and blooming flowers, which are, in all the world, alone to be found in the deep valleys of England.</p> 
               <p>It was, as we have said, situated in the genial climate of Devonshire, and the luxuriant vegetation natural to the soil, came in aid to the agricultural arts which so cultivate and embellish English country residences-the true homes of England.</p> 
               <p>The house was situated in a large park, at the end of the village. Nearly the whole village belonged to Mary, and the neat and pretty cottages of her tenants, with their green painted shutters-the porch<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7216-00000177"/> over which climbed the vine and the honey-suckle, and the blooming little garden, in which common flowers and common fruits were mingled in orderly luxuriance, testified of her kindness, and the prosperity and good conduct of her tenants.</p> 
               <p>It was summer-the second summer since Clara, San Giusto, and little Marie had left the gigantic, toiling, progressing vortex of the new world, for the calm of Mary's quiet home.</p> 
               <p>The day had been unusually warm; but now the heavy dews had risen, and lay like seas of diamonds on the smooth lawns glittering beneath the beams of the bright full moon high up in the blue heavens. The trees, laden with young fruit, the bushes heavy with perfumed blossoms, murmured soothingly in the gentle breeze, and the nightingales sang their charmed song from every bush.</p> 
               <p>It was a heavenly, peaceful night; and from the windows of the house, standing in the midst of this Eden, there gleamed a bright light, and sounds of sweet voices mingled with the breezes of heaven and the songs of the nightingales.</p> 
               <p>A weary, toil-worn traveler, on this night, crept with cautious step over the soft, dew-stained turf, and with stealthy step reached the deep veranda which shaded the whole of the lower windows of the house. Concealed behind the roses, the clematis, and the ivy, which entirely covered this veranda, the traveler stopped, and leaning his weary brow against the cool leaves, he gazed in at the open window, whence proceeded the sound and the light. And as his eye wandered from one to the other, of those within the room on which he gazed, his lips pronounced their names in stifled, melancholy murmurs.</p> 
               <p>There, by the shaded lamp, sat a woman whose beauty time had matured, but not marred. She was attentively reading, and as she sat, the traveler breathed the name of</p> 
               <p>"Mary!"</p> 
               <p>Then further on, at the other end of the large drawing-room, where the flashing light revealed both luxury and taste, at a grand piano was a gentleman of handsome and dignified aspect, long past the prime of youth; standing by his side was a lady in the full bloom of youth, and of almost ideal beauty. One hand rested on his shoulder, and her eyes were raised as she poured forth in deep pathos the strains of the "Ave Maria." By her side, the refulgence of the lamp streaming on the long ringlets till they, too, looked like rays of light in their auburn brightness, stood a child of some five years old-and her lustrous eyes, too, were raised in wondering admiration to the<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7216-00000178"/> singer, against whom she nestled, and whose other hand she tightly clasped.</p> 
               <p>"Clara-Marie!" murmured the traveler; and burying his face in his hands, he wept. And still the voice poured forth its deep and holy strains, and then another, a manly voice, joined in its melody, and the trembling silvery tones of the child chimed in, as the last chords of the Ave Maria were wafted on the breeze.</p> 
               <p>And still, his face buried in his hands, the traveler wept; and when, as the sounds ceased, he raised his head, she whom he had called Clara, stood by the door of the room, a light in her hand, and the child flitting from the piano to the sofa, was playfully repeating "good night" to the caresses, which at both places greeted her.</p> 
               <p>At length she seized her mother's hand, and they issued forth-and the eyes of the traveler followed the light, as it passed from window to window along the veranda, until it stopped and gleamed steadily from two others, not far removed from where he stood.</p> 
               <p>Again he crept along the smooth turf, and again he looked into the room where now were the two he loved and watched.</p> 
               <p>It was their sleeping room; and the little white-curtained crib of the child stood beside its mother's bed; and with swift and gentle hand the mother was undressing the little babbling, playful child.</p> 
               <p>And now she clasps it in her arms, and lays it tenderly on its pillow; but the child, springing from her, runs across the room, with its little bare feet glancing on the bright carpet, and throwing open the glass door which opened to the ground, exclaiming,</p> 
               <p>"Mamma, mamma, the stars-the stars!" looking with its bright, wondering eyes up at the glittering heavens.</p> 
               <p>Hastily the traveler threw himself behind the flowery pillar, and then with suspended breath he listened to the tender voices near him.</p> 
               <p>"The stars, mamma!" said Marie, "how they shine to-night! Is the one that travelers and sailors go by, there? and won't it bring papa home soon, very soon? He can see now to come from ever so far-look up and show me his star."</p> 
               <p>"It is there, my darling," replied the young mother, gazing upwards till the bright moonbeams showed her face in minute distinctness, that made the watcher's heart beat and throb in agony; "there by the beautiful moon; and it is guiding papa over the deep sea to his Marie."</p> 
               <p>"What is the country called that is so far off, mamma, that papa is, oh so long, so long in coming-where is papa?"</p> 
               <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7216-00000179"/> 
               <p>"I do not know the name of the country, my child," replied her mother; "but wherever he is, he is thinking of mamma, and his darling. Now, Marie, say God bless papa, and then go to your bed and sleep, and you will dream of him, dream that he is coming back."</p> 
               <p>And, kneeling in the moonlight, its little hands clasped, its fair hair streaming back, and her head raised to heaven, the child uttered fervently,</p> 
               <p>"God bless papa."</p> 
               <p>Then springing up, it snatched a hasty kiss from its mother, and ran back into the room.</p> 
               <p>The mother leaned against the opposite pillar of the veranda to the one behind which the traveler was concealed-she clasped her hands together and continued still to gaze upwards.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Harry!" said she, in gentle, but audible tones; "oh, Harry! my love, my love! where are you? Are you in the land of spirits, and do you, with my mother, look down and watch for me from those bright stars? If you live, oh come to me! or even as a spirit, freed from the world of sorrow, oh come to me-let me see you once again!"</p> 
               <p>"Clara!" said the traveler, rushing from his concealment and falling at her feet; "Clara-I am here! Your guilty husband, who has through misery and suffering come but to behold you once again, to implore forgiveness, and to die."</p> 
               <p>"Harry!" exclaimed Clara, extending her arms towards him; "speak again, for I doubt my senses! Strain me to your heart! for I dread to move, lest it should be a vision."</p> 
               <p>Harry took her in his arms, and madly he strained her to his heart; and she wound her arms round him, her living, breathing husband, and clung to his lips with ardent kisses, murmuring low, broken words of love.</p> 
               <p>"Forgive me, Clara, all the past-oh, I have expiated it, how deeply!"</p> 
               <p>"Hush, Harry!" said Clara, smiling; "hush! I cannot forgive the past-I have forgotten it. My only love, my Harry has been away-far away-and I have waited for him-that is all-and I knew he would come, and he is come-and we are all so happy now!"</p> 
               <p>Then, taking the poor trembling traveler by the hand, and tenderly supporting him-for he could scarcely stand, and the tears streamed unchecked down his careworn cheek-she entered the room, and took him to the bed, where in the listless, careless grace of childhood, Marie slept.</p> 
               <p>Tremblingly he knelt beside the bed, and pressed his lips on the fair brow, laced with the clear blue veins. Then, as he knelt, he turned, and twining his arms<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7216-00000180"/> round Clara's waist, he buried his head in her bosom and sobbed and wept unrestrainedly.</p> 
               <p>She, putting both her hands on his head, and drawing him to her, looked out through the open windows at the starry heavens, and murmured solemnly in her own soft language,</p> 
               <p>"Mother! if thy spirit watches, thou seest that I have obeyed thee-I have never loved but one-my husband!"</p>

               <p>Now it came to pass that like all things "overwarm," the enthusiasm of the public, raised to the very highest pitch about Caroline, suddenly and abruptly became discontented with its idol.</p> 
               <p>They had gained their point; and though it is impossible to say what reward they had expected for their frantic partisanship, certain it is that the capricious public began to experience something like a feeling of having been taken in.</p> 
               <p>In the first place, Caroline, whom popular enthusiasm had endowed gradually with every perfection, was found out to possess no genius whatever as an actress-that was one disappointment. Then, Caroline<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7216-00000181"/> was handsome, certainly, but it was not the kind of beauty the imaginative public had expected the betrayed, suffering, and forsaken wife to possess.</p> 
               <p>She did not look like a woman that needed protection. Her well-developed frame, her haughty manner, even her robust health irritated those who had fought her battles, expecting to behold some pale, suffering creature, with faltering step and appealing look. But as she stood before them, they discovered that it was no victim they had protected, but one combatant they had backed against another, in a contest where the strength, both physical and moral, seemed equally divided.</p> 
               <p>But having no talent! Now actually, Caroline had not pledged herself to be a genius; but it was expected of her. Had she not been so many years with her husband-followed him, watched him, studied him? And was she not the daughter of an actor? And yet, though she dressed well, and walked the stage with confidence, neither in tragedy nor comedy, could even her most partial friends accord the slightest spark of any gifts or inspiration that should have bid her be an actress. She didn't even say the words-true, most erudite public, most true; a fact which originated in causes which they knew not of.</p> 
               <p>Then her husband, the much-abused husband, was actually, spite of the triumph obtained over him, filling a rival theatre nightly, from pit to gallery, his genius unimpaired, his popularity undiminished. The public got sulky with Caroline Oakwood, or rather, there had been an unnatural excitement, and now there was a most natural reaction, and the public pulse began to beat temperately, ashamed of its late delirium. And soon forgetting its inspirer, it looked round for some other nine days' wonder, that should again rouse it from its torpid state.</p> 
               <p>As for Caroline, she committed one blunder after another. Having reached the summit of her ambition, she kicked down the ladder which had helped her up, too soon. Offended respectability revenged itself in abusing her. She neglected and utterly ceased to toadey, the bevy of vain and brainless women who expected to have been allowed to exhibit themselves by her side, and utterly refused to be patronized. Having through much labor and most clever manuvring, conquered by her reserve and virtue, Caroline no sooner felt herself free, than she set about attaining another position, another reputation-one which had been the real object of her ambition all through her life, and which she really had secretly set up in her own heart as the reward of all the weariness, the hypocrisy, and the humiliations through which she had passed. She<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7216-00000182"/> desired to become herself the founder and head of a circle, such as did not yet exist. It was to consist of all the men of fashion, all foreigners of distinction, all the literary men, including journalism; in fact, she was to be the modern Aspasia, around whom all these stars were to revolve-a sort of mixture of a handsome Mdme. de Stael and a virtuous Ninon. She intended to originate a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">salon,</foreign> or circle, which, with all the refinement of the highest, should have none of its formality or its pruderies. Philosophers and politicians were to delight in her society-for Caroline dabbled in all theories; new doctrines were her delight. Poets and actors-only the great ones-would of course flock round her. She dreamed of a well-lighted dining-room, sumptuously served, in which every night, on her return from her theatrical triumphs, this distinguished circle should await her. How the world would talk of her-how envy her! How the women of the higher class would strive to get into her circle! But she would not admit them! No-she would remain the bright particular star. And when she should have money enough, she would go to Europe, whither fame should have preceded her, and there-but it is useless to pursue farther the vain imaginings of Caroline's soliloquies, for they were never destined to be realized.</p> 
               <p>Her first disappointment arose in the fact that none of the fashionable leading young men of New York did get charmed with her, and that none asked to be introduced to her-not one. Her dressing-room, but for Alessandro Alessandrini, would have been wholly to herself and her maid. Then, after the first ovation, no one called on her; and with the exception of crowded houses, which brought her large sums, curiosity not being yet gratified, Caroline's life had perhaps never been more tiresome or monotonous.</p> 
               <p>At this crisis, an actor of some repute, an Englishman by birth, who had known her in former times; but sedulously preserved a safe and masterly neutrality during the time of her probation and trial, suddenly became assiduous in his visits.</p> 
               <p>Charles Falconbridge was a man of education and refined manners. Before choosing the stage as a profession, he had seen the best society, and was a thorough man of the world. He was a Catholic and a Jesuit-had been a lawyer and a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">roue;</foreign> and now he was an actor, without having ceased to practice any of the principles inculcated by the other positions he had occupied in life.</p> 
               <p>He came to Caroline at a most critical juncture; for besides the utter isolation in which she found herself, Caroline really was in a most embarrassed position with regard to her theatrical career.</p> 
               <pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7216-00000183"/> 
               <p>She had found out that she had no talent-indeed, she had always known it; but she had through life so effectually feigned feelings and sentiments she did not possess, that she had relied on her own ability for feigning them on the mimic stage, as she had on the stage of life. But it would not do. As the necessity for new parts came before her, she trembled-she felt the ground failing beneath her feet. She learned with difficulty, her memory was treacherous; she had no imagination, and of course no knowledge of the routine of the stage. What should she do? in whom confide her ignorance? If she had genius, all would have come instinctively; but now-who could help her? Falconbridge! He came like the Deus et machina, just at the right moment, and Caroline clung to him as a sinking mariner to a plank.</p> 
               <p>Caroline Oakwood was very good capital. Falconbridge wanted money, and he could make it out of her-it really was a shame to throw such a chance away! So to work he went. Caroline was artful-but he was a master of art. He wooed her through her vanity-he mastered her by his superior knowledge-she became his very slave.</p> 
               <p>The successful result of his first counsels-the terrible feeling of fear and dread-the actual trouble he took off Caroline's mind-rendered him in a short time indispensable. Then he flattered her, feigning an exclusive, overwhelming passion, until she was inthralled, nor perceived that she, who had violently sundered the holiest of all human bonds, was enchained to the will of one, who, scorning and despising her, humbled her and made her each day more dependent on his tyrant will.</p> 
               <p>But it was over; Caroline had found her master. For him she toiled-losing the respect of the world, earned at so terrible a price-until her greatest partisans became ashamed of having been her defenders, and came at last to deny her.</p> 
               <p>From state to state, from town to town, was she dragged by Falconbridge, hurrying to reap the harvest of popular curiosity excited by her name. Sedulously her tyrant kept the world from her; she saw but him. He took her to the theatre; he brought her from it. He gave orders that no visitors should be admitted. He also took care of the receipts-a fact which perhaps contributed to Caroline's submission to his will-for nothing quells the spirit like the utter absence of money; and often Caroline had to beg a few dollars she herself had earned.</p> 
               <p>At length they had exhausted the field-there was nothing more to be gained, excepting in such far distant lands as Falconbridge did not dare to venture.<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7216-00000184"/> He had enough-he was satisfied. Besides, their life had become intolerable. The slave would often rebel; and the continual effort to keep her at his feet, was beginning to weary him. So they separated-that is, Falconbridge, with a well-filled pocket-book, sailed for Europe, leaving Caroline almost without any resources whatever, to pursue what career she chose.</p> 
               <p>We will not follow her step by step, nor watch her as she descended the various grades of the social scale, ever in search of gratification for her insatiate vanity, her untiring ambition. Now the public papers spoke of her as the companion of gamblers and blacklegs-now as the patroness of prize-fighters and firemen. In the gambling saloons of the city of dissipation and gold-dust, at one time she was the attraction, and all strove anxiously to try their fortunes at the wheel turned by the famous Caroline Saint Maur.</p> 
               <p>And years passed on-summers and winters-and none of those whose fate had been so linked together ever crossed each others' paths, or heard each others' names-yet all were destined to meet again.</p> 
               <p>One fine autumn evening, just after sunset, a crowd was gathered under the trees in front of the State House in Philadelphia. It was the day after election, and at this particular moment the crowd was gathered round the successful candidate just elected to one of the highest civic offices of the state. He was popular with all classes, and his countrymen, one and all, were proud of him. He was their own native-born child-Edgar Oakwood, who had withstood the thunders of injustice with so firm and erect a form, that they had fallen harmless at his feet. He had calmly reconquered popularity; his genius had arisen greater from the fiery heart-trials through which he had passed. He had achieved fame greater than any; he had acquired riches that gave him palaces and broad lands-and the love and respect of his fellow-citizens had placed him amongst its honored servants.</p> 
               <p>And now he comes forward-and shouts rend the air. He advances with his proud bearing, and the sad, calm look, his habitual expression now. Friends are round him, and the crowd gives way as he passes through their midst, smiling and bowing. But suddenly they are stopped; the crowd is so dense they cannot pass-there is jostling, struggling and hustling, and loud shouting-they needs must pause.</p> 
               <p>"Only a policeman as is a doing his duty-it will soon be over," said a by-stander.</p> 
               <p>"A pickpocket, I imagine," said one of Edgar's friends.</p> 
               <p>"No it aint; it's a mad woman, or a druken woman;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7216-00000185"/> don't you hear her shriek?" exclaimed the first speaker.</p> 
               <p>A phrenzied shriek was borne towards them, piercing and distinct, above the noise of the crowd. A rude burst of laughter answered the sound; but Edgar Oakwood abruptly paused, and turned his head in the direction whence it came.</p> 
               <p>At this moment, there was a violent jostling and pushing-the crowd drew back on either side; and through the narrow lane thus made, came a woman, rushing madly along, pursued by two policemen, whose strength had been insufficient to hold her. Shrieking madly, with glowing, bloodshot eyes and disheveled hair, this wretched creature, not knowing where she went, instinctively fled on. Her garments, torn as they were clutched by the men who strove to stop her course, scarcely covered her bosom or her shoulders. Her arms were bare, excepting for some tattered remnants of coarse lace undersleeves. Her feet protruded from misshapen and dirty satin boots. She was a hapless wreck-for there was that about her, degraded, miserable, wretched as she was, which spoke of better days. She paused nor turned not, till the powerful arm of Oakwood, extended before her, suddenly arrested her course.</p> 
               <p>She staggered, and glared at him; but the stern and unflinching eye of Oakwood was on her, and for an instant appeared to possess an almost magic power over her. She threw back the long masses of her hair, the black tresses of which were mingled profusely with streaks of grey; she passed her hand over her forehead rapidly, two or three times; then she glared at him again, and burst into a wild laugh, till the bloody froth oozed from her mouth-then suddenly madness again took possession of her brain, and clasping tightly Edgar's arm, she shouted in a hoarse yell,</p> 
               <p>"Take them away! the howling dogs with the human eyes I know, they pierce me with such darts! take them away! Mercy! oh, mercy; keep it off! keep off!" and Edgar's frame seemed to stagger beneath her grasp, and the muscular arm she held, trembled.</p> 
               <p>"Delirium tremens," "whiskey," "drink," "the bottle," was with contempt and disgust whispered in the crowd; "take her down"-"too good for her"-and so on, as the two policemen, now coming up, one on each side of her, took each an arm and jerked it violently behind her.</p> 
               <p>But, scarcely had they touched her when Edgar, with his giant strength, threw them off, and holding her himself, all struggling and yelling as she was, with a firm, immovable grasp, he exclaimed,<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7216-00000186"/> "Keep off! I know the woman; I will take her to her friends. Maurice," continued he to one of the gentlemen who accompanied him, "help me."</p> 
               <p>Maurice looked up at Oakwood; he was deadly pale, and his ashy lips trembled; yet he had spoken distinctly, in his clear, deep voice, and he still, with untiring strength, held the wild, shrieking woman. Maurice cast one glance from Edgar to her, and a remembrance, vivid and clear, and sharp as a flash of lightning, shot through his mind. He staggered; a sickness came over him; he too became deadly pale, and gasped for breath.</p> 
               <p>"Help me!" repeated Oakwood, in a voice of such tender, pitying appeal, that Maurice roused himself, returned with a look of intense sympathy the deep, sad gaze of his friend, and putting his arm round the woman on the other side, they made their way through the crowd, which opened silently as they passed-for it instinctively felt that some great mysterious passion and sorrow was passing before them, and the idle jest was stilled, and the shout of derision died on the lips about to utter it, at the sight of Edgar Oakwood's ghastly face.</p> 
               <p>"Where?" said Maurice, the first words he had uttered to Edgar, when after much difficulty they had succeeded in placing the wretched woman between them in Edgar's carriage; "where? Home?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Home! she has none; never again to mine! Take us to some quiet, obscure hotel."</p> 
               <p>Maurice gave rapidly a few directions to the coach man, and they drove off.</p> 
               <p>Then, as they drove along the crowded streets, Edgar remembered another wretched, miserable drive, side by side with the wife, the beautiful, the beloved, from whom he was parting, with his heart's-blood tears-and now-oh Heaven! his frame shook with emotion and horror.</p> 
               <p>Maurice spoke not; he could scarcely believe in the reality of what he beheld. But the woman, who in spite of their efforts to support her, lay shrieking, in strong convulsions at the bottom of the carriage, was a direful confirmation of the fatal truth.</p> 
               <p>They reached the place indicated by Maurice; money and Edgar's name procured the necessary accommodations, a nurse, and a physician. Edgar never left the room, and never, but in short, brief sentences, to give the necessary directions, never spoke. At length, by means of a strong opiate, the raving woman was plunged into a deep sleep. Then the nurse bound up her hair, washed away the marks of dust and filth which stained her features, and enveloping her in fair, clean, decent garments, laid her, all unconscious as she was, on the comfortable pillows. When all was done,<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7216-00000187"/> and the doctor had given his directions, which were simply to let her sleep, and the nurse had placed the shaded light in a distant corner of the room, Edgar arose from the seat where silently and as one in a trance he had sat.</p> 
               <p>"Go," said he to the nurse; "I will watch alone; sleep till morning. She will not wake till then. Good night, Maurice-tell them at home not to expect me; and leave me here alone."</p> 
               <p>Maurice pressed his friend's hand silently, and withdrew to do his bidding; the nurse was gone; and Edgar closed and locked the door.</p> 
               <p>He was alone in that small, silent room; no sound but the deep breathing of the sleeping woman, resting unconsciously, as in the sleep of death, upon the pillow.</p> 
               <p>As he turned from the door, he gazed at her, but he seemed afraid to draw near the bed. He stood supporting himself on the back of a chair, for his strength was gone; he had tottered as he walked, and the very hand on the chair trembled, and his broad chest heaved with deep convulsive sobs, as he gazed intently at her, as, calm and immovable, she slumbered on. But the tears now gathered in his eyes, and with one half-suppressed groan of agony, he rushed to the bed. He threw himself on his knees beside it-he put his arms over the sleeping form; and burying his face in the bed-clothes, as though to stifle the sound, he murmured,</p> 
               <p>"Caroline!"</p> 
               <p>And there through the long night he knelt, listening to her regular and deep breathing. And he thought of the many years she had lain in his arms, pillowed on his breast; and he saw her as his bride, all flowers and lace, so fresh and young-oh, Heaven! the tattered, wild, degraded being before him, hunted by a jeering crowd! And he saw her tearful eye raised to his in love and sorrow, as they together weepingly bent over the little corpse of their first-born child. And then he remembered her, so cold and stern, so inexorable, when they had parted forever, to meet again no more on earth, he thought-but never, oh God! to meet as now they met! And he wept-wept over the love of other days-the hopes of his youth-the wreck of two lives-and so waned this long, long night.</p> 
               <p>And now she moves; the opiate has done its work; and Edgar gently unwinds his arms, and noiselessly he rises; with stealthy step he takes his station where she cannot see him, but where he can watch her every movement as she wakes. Wakes! to what?-to consciousness, to madness, or to death?</p> 
               <p>Which will it be? The physician could not tell.</p> 
               <pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7216-00000188"/> 
               <p>Which is to be desired? Edgar shuddered as he asked himself that dreadful question.</p> 
               <p>She moves again; she wakes; her eyes are open-but she does not start or look around with wonder or surprise. Her hands play listlessly with the bedclothes-her eye is dull and fixed.</p> 
               <p>Edgar moved, that the sound might rouse her, but she heard it not. He came from where he had hidden himself-she heeded him not. Again he knelt by the bed-she changed not, nor turned, but still clutched at the bed-clothes. Still her eyes were fixed in a vacant, listless stare.</p> 
               <p>"Caroline," said Edgar, in a deep whisper, close to her ear; "Caroline! my wife!"</p> 
               <p>But no consciousness showed she had heard these words, wrung from the heart of her husband-and he watched again; he hoped-what did he hope? There was nothing to hope!-he knew it, he felt it. Yet one word which should efface the past-one sign of repentance and love, that should enshrine her memory, that should let him dare to remember her. "Oh, Caroline! speak it! leave one holy memory on earth-let such deep love, hallowed by heaven-the love of our youth-draw you for one moment to holy thoughts and consciousness; and then-go to the never-tiring mercy of your God!" for he felt, he knew, as he buried his face in his hands, that for him, for the world, for herself, it was better that she should die, than live in misery and scorn.</p> 
               <p>"But speak one word-say 'Edgar'-call me husband-once, but once more, Caroline! Poor Caroline! unhappy Caroline! How thou hast suffered! See! all thy beauty gone, and thy hair is white! And the eyes-I scarce can bear to look at them! And the sunken cheek, and the distorted features-oh, Caroline! speak one word of peace, of love-your password to heaven, my talisman on earth. From thy crimes to me I absolve thee; heaven have mercy on thee, for thou hast bitterly paid the price of guilt!"</p> 
               <p>But all was vain; consciousness was gone forever more. Life fluttered still about the heart, but memory and feeling were dead. And so, as the grey dawn broke upon the still slumbering city, the restless, active, daring spirit passed in silence and oblivion away, nor left to him who watched and mourned, one look or word with which to hallow these last moments of their sad re-union and their final and eternal separation.</p> 
               <p>With daylight came the physician. He found the watcher pacing the room with slow and solemn step. He pointed to the bed, where now all was still-the doctor placed his hand upon the heart-it beat no more, and all was over.</p> 
               <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7216-00000189"/> 
               <p>Then came Maurice, the faithful, sorrowing friend, and the nurse, to do the last offices to the dead.</p> 
               <p>And Edgar, motioning the woman from the bed, went up to it, leaning on Maurice's shoulder, and gazed in silence; a long, long look upon the features to which death had restored symmetry and solemn repose. And he stroked the hair back from the brow, and with firm and heavy hand he closed the eyes; then again his gaze wandered over the form now cold and rigid. Then, taking the sheet, after a last sad look, he threw it over the head of the corpse, and half turning, his hand still resting on the head defined beneath its white pall, he said in a calm, firm voice,</p> 
               <p>"Maurice, let the last offices be done in secresy and silence. Let none ever look on her more. Let no babbling papers tell her fate-nor let the authorities inquire. She died a natural death-and when she lived, this, this was her name." He strove to pronounce it, but it died upon his lips; and going to the table, he snatched a pencil from the physician's hand, and wrote, in large, uneven characters, for the last time his hand should ever trace it-</p> 
               <p>"Caroline Oakwood."</p> 
               <p>Then, without another look at the corpse, he left the room. Maurice followed him, but Edgar seemed unconscious of his presence; and they walked side by side through the silent streets, lighted by the grey dawn of morning, till Maurice, alarmed and anxious, put his hand on Edgar's arm. At his touch, Edgar started and looked around, as though just roused to consciousness. Then, as he encountered Maurice's anxious glance, he smiled a gentle, tender smile, and extending his hand, he pressed it and said,</p> 
               <p>"Go to her, Maurice; I will fulfill my marriage vow. I swore to take her for better and for worse. She threw me from her in her life-but all have now forsaken her, and there is none but her husband to lay her in her grave. Go and see it done, then come to me.

               <p>Edgar pursued his way to the magnificent abode he called his home; and as he stood beneath the high columned portico, on the marble steps, he thought of the cold corpse, lying in oblivion, in the hands of strangers, in an obscure inn-she who should have been the proud mistress of the mansion, and the object of his love and care-and he looked up at the heavens, where the grey clouds parting were unvailing<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7216-00000190"/> the bright sun, and he thought of the short-sightedness of human ambition, and the vanity of human self-reliance-and gazing on the gold and purple tints, ere he crossed the threshold of his home, he murmured in his heart, for though his lips moved, they scarce gave utterance to the words-</p>

               <p>RUSHTON had found his place awaiting him in the holy happy home which sheltered his wife and child. But though Clara received him with all the fervor of unaltered love, nor asked one question of the past, Mary and San Giusto welcomed him somewhat coldly at first; they could not forget the agonies through which their darling had passed-nor could they excuse his faithlessness, or imagine any palliation to the crime of forsaking the pure and beautiful creature whom, young as she was, they themselves reverenced whilst they loved.</p> 
               <p>Mary, even on principle, resisted the feelings which bid her forget, and be towards Harry what she had been before; she thought it good for the future happiness<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7216-00000191"/> ness of both, and for Harry's character, that the great lesson of his life should not be lightly passed over.</p> 
               <p>San Giusto's first feelings towards his son-in-law were those of resentment. Then the isolation of San Giusto's early years, from the corruption of the world, his early and happy marriage, which had preserved him from the destructive philosophy of men of the world, his misfortunes, the one love of his life, made him unable to comprehend or extenuate the wild passion which had alienated Harry from one he once had passionately loved. He was cold and reserved, and almost jealous of the passionate affection Clara felt for him. Yet her elastic step, bounding to meet Harry, her glistening eye, the merry unrolling of her voice resounding through the house, showed his daughter to him as he had never seen her yet. He would smile and look at her with admiration, but suddenly a frown would darken his brow, and he would look towards Harry, and with a deep sigh wonder how long this present love would last, and dread some change in this wayward, imaginative, mercurial temperament, which should again leave his Clara in solitude and desolation.</p> 
               <p>Clara had no fears, no dread; her love had never wavered; it had been part of her life, was incorporated with her nature. Harry had returned to her, Harry had again told her he loved her, and implicitly she had believed and trusted him. She had never referred to the past, nor asked him where he had wandered since he left his home. She knew as she looked on him, that her Harry must have suffered much; he was altered-even love itself could not but see that, though love might think all changes for the better; and after the few first days of ecstasy at their re-union, she saw that Harry's manner and character were different from what they once had been. The wit that then sparkled, now rarely flashed; the eager poetic fancy, which a word could rouse, was never now evoked; the very voice was changed-it had a touching, melancholy tone-that gay piercing voice, which once made the heart bound with merriment at its very sound. Clara watched, and a vague anxiety took possession of her heart; but she breathed it not, either to her father or to Mary, who, like herself, watched Harry as she watched him, with as much anxiety, if not with the same indulgence and love.</p> 
               <p>One day Clara and San Giusto had driven to the neighboring town, when Mary entered the small boudoir opening into the veranda and on to the smooth lawn, gay with autumn flowers. This room had got<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC7216-00000192"/> to be called Clara's room, and it was here she spent her mornings with Harry.</p> 
               <p>Mary, a large bouquet of flowers in her hand, threw open the door of this room, and there, his face buried in his hands, in the darkest corner, turning away from the fair landscape without, sat Harry.</p> 
               <p>He raised his head as Mary entered, and his eyes encountered hers. His look was so gentle, so appealing, yet so deeply melancholy, that Mary was moved by it, and spoke to him with something of the congeniality of old times.</p> 
               <p>"Mary," exclaimed Harry, rising and extending his hand towards her; "Mary! you do not, cannot hate me! Oh, listen to me, come to me, help me, as you ever did-for I am very miserable."</p> 
               <p>"Miserable, Harry Rushton," said Mary; "how may that be? Do you not love our Clara after all?"</p> 
               <p>"Listen to me, Mary," said Harry, rising and closing the door; "no one has listened to me since I have returned, and my heart is so full with contending feelings. Oh, Mary! you, my best friend, you whose sad experience has made you wise, calm and resigned, if not happy-listen to me, now."</p> 
               <p>Mary put down her flowers and seated herself on a sofa. She held out her hand to Harry, and motioned him to sit beside her. Harry had talked of her calmness ness, but Mary seemed deeply moved; she was pale, and her hand as it clasped his, was cold. For herself she could bear any thing-indeed, for her individual happiness, she had no care; her life was over, she lived but in others. Clara and Marie were all she loved-through them only could unhappiness reach her. What was Harry about to reveal? Had Caroline still possession of his imagination?</p> 
               <p>"Speak, Harry," said she, "I can bear all. Do you no longer love our Clara?"</p> 
               <p>"Love her! No, Mary, I dare not love her. I reverence, I worship her. I feel when by her side as the patriarchs did in the presence of the angels. But Mary, I feel I am unworthy of her-I feel, too, that you, that her father, look on me with coldness, with regret. You think me unworthy of your child-and oh, Mary, I am, I am!"</p> 
               <p>Mary did not speak; she gently passed her hand through his hair, and wiped the drops of agony that had started to his brow. In a few minutes Harry proceeded.</p> 
               <p>"I am unworthy of her in every way. How young, how beautiful she is! Now she has found a father, and a name, and riches; had she not been my wife, to what might she not have aspired? Does not her father think this, each hour as he looks on me?"</p> 
               <pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7216-00000193"/> 
               <p>"No, Harry, or he were unworthy of such a daughter, nor could he feel her excellence as he does. It is not that."</p> 
               <p>"Not that! ah, Mary, then there is something! My forebodings are right-he hates me! Your kind, gentle nature, incapable of hate, pities me; and, oh Heaven! perhaps my wife but gives me the semblance of love, inspired by her pure, angelic nature. She perhaps loves me not! I have trampled on her heart, worn out the love that once was there."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, it were sacrilege to think it, Harry. You are the idol of her heart-I know how she mourned you, how she wept, how the sunlight of her life was gone, with you away."</p> 
               <p>"And now-oh, Mary! much as I loathe the subject, I must speak of the wretched past. Clara has never asked me where the two years of my miserable life were passed, nor have you questioned, nor has her father ever spoken to me one word but of cold courtesy, and indifference. I feel like an intruder on your bounty-one whom your duty, not your love, has brought within the holy, happy circle, complete without my presence. I have felt, as I watched from this window, as I often have hidden behind these curtains-the father's arm encircling the daughter, and beheld our Marie gambol before them on yonder lawn, that I was nothing in their lives, nothing-and yet, Mary, if you knew all I suffered to get but one look of my Clara-all I dared hope for, all I endured-from whence I came-from the mines of Melbourne, Mary, where as a laborer I had toiled!"</p> 
               <p>"Poor Harry!" said Mary; "tell me all now, for this is what has estranged me from you-wounded me perhaps-your want of confidence in me, your silence, your reserve. Tell me all now."</p> 
               <p>"When I fled madly from that home I had polluted, Mary, it was not jealousy nor love of that woman, which drove me from it-it was shame-it was remorse. I saw my Clara sleeping, with our child close nestled in her arms; I gazed at them, and engraved, as I gazed, their image in my heart. But I dared not wake them, even for a last look. Calm, pure and holy, they lay before me; I felt as though to touch them would be to consume them. My temples beat and burned, my frame trembled, my eyes swam. That woman's voice, her paramour's laugh, sounded in my ears. I was mad, Mary, and like a madman I fled-out of my home, along the streets, wildly, on, on. Instinctively my steps took the direction towards the bay-I was suffocating-I wanted air-it seemed as though I could only breathe in the broad open space; and perhaps, Mary, some latent thought of self-destruction impelled<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7216-00000194"/> me on. On I fled. At length I reached the Battery. The broad bay was before me. I threw back my head, I looked out afar-I beheld the dark ships on the deep waters, the moon glistening on the heaving waves; but I felt, though here I breathed more freely, the wild desire to fly far, far away. A boat with many oars was near the shore, and the hum of many busy voices struck upon my ear. I comprehended that the boat was bound for the ship that lay in dark shadow beyond. I knew not whither it was bound. The sailors and passengers now about to embark, knew not whether I was not one of them. I followed them into the boat-mounted with them the ship's side, we heaved anchor, and by dawn we had lost sight of land.</p> 
               <p>"I was soon discovered to be an intruder. Overcome by mental exhaustion and physical suffering, I could scarcely reply to any questions. I had no money, but they tended me with a rough kindness, and I was restored to strength and to health. We were bound for Australia. I heard the destination, so far from all, without emotion-I cared not where I went. I worked my passage over, like a common seaman. In Melbourne I hired myself to the eager miners for bread to eat. I saw gold before me, dug it from the earth; but it had no value in my eyes-what could gold bring to me? Forgetfulness, the treasures of the mines could not buy; nor love, nor hope-all were gone. I beheld men come poor; and depart with joy, and triumph, laden with the gold I had helped to disembowel from the earth; but it was without envy, and without emotion. I sought a new master-the instinct of self-preservation made me do that. My task over, I sank upon the earth, and wrapped in my rude blanket, I slept a heavy, torpid, dreamless sleep. I was incapable of thought; I, so utterly unused to manual labor, was now incapable of any other. It was as though that woman had infused a deadly poison into my brain and heart-like the subtle venom which the Malay assassin infuses into the veins of his victim, leaving it to do its deadly work, through years and years of slow decay. Intellect and memory seemed gone; my heart seared. No thought of Clara ever came to soothe or calm me, but Caroline's image was ever before me. She seemed chained to me, like the iron bullet of the criminal. How I loathed each memory of her! how I strove to tear her from my remembrance! but in vain, in vain! She haunted me in sleep; she stood like the furies that pursued Orestes, like an avenging demon, ever by my side.</p> 
               <p>"Heaven had mercy on me at last. I slept exhausted by a hard day's labor. I was a favorite with those who wanted labor, for I worked indefatigably to kill thought<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7216-00000195"/> by violent bodily exertion. And as I slept I dreamed a holy, happy dream; the incubus which had watched by my pillow on that night vanished. Two angels were in its place, Clara and my child. I dreamed they bent towards me with looks of love, with words of forgiveness. All night the vision lasted, till wakened by loud voices and rude hands, it vanished.</p> 
               <p>"But I was a new man; my listlessness, my apathy were gone-the clouds which obscured my intellect and memory had disappeared. I yearned for my old pursuits, my former occupations; the drudging labor of the hands now appeared to me hard work, and I turned from it with distaste.</p> 
               <p>"Clara and my child were ever before me; strange that till then I had had no anxiety for their actual position. I had dwelt with repentance and remorse on her wrongs, as a woman and a wife; I had despised myself for my own blind folly, and as my memory compared the two, Clara who had given me the three bright years of happiness my life had ever known, and Caroline who had destroyed it, I was almost tempted to believe the old stories of the love-spells by which it is said demons have bound to them the children of men. It had been a blind infatuation, one not to be accounted for, not to be explained."</p> 
               <p>"I can explain the infatuation, Harry," said Mary, "for though I do not know this woman, I have read her spell. It is self-love-she appeals to the self-love of those she would inthrall; 'tis not love of her, but love of themselves, exquisite flattery, well applied, that makes men slaves at her feet-she knows it too; never for once does she deceive herself; she knows there is no true love in the passion she inspires, but she cares not; she will accept any homage, provided it is homage, and she can use it for her own purposes."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps it was, Mary; then the weaker fool was I. I know I never loved her. And now I loathe her with deep loathing, and a deep feeling of humiliation and unworthiness comes over me often, when Clara lays her head on my shoulder and looks up to me with her deep, pure, truthful glance. I scarcely dare press my lips on her brow, I feel as though it were sacrilege, as though I should sear that calm, white brow, and leave on it the mark of the scorching, burning, unholy kisses of a wanton-oh Mary! I bear my punishment about me, remorse, sleepless, untiring remorse. Better had I never returned, but died unknown in that land of toil, digging from the earth the gold that was to minister to the evil, greedy passions of man, and bring him to look for rest in the bosom of that mother earth, dust like that from which his destroyer, gold, gold, had sprung. Better had I died."</p> 
               <pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7216-00000196"/> 
               <p>Mary laid her hand gently on his, but she spoke not, she waited till his agony of despair had passed; but he felt her pitying glance was on him, the very silence, the calmness of Mary soothed him. At length he raised his head and proceeded.</p> 
               <p>"I did not die, Mary, for a mad desire to see my Clara once again, my darling Marie, and my home! took possession of my soul. Now too harrowing pictures of her unprotected state, of her youth, of her helplessness, came perpetually before me, haunted me by day and night. I could have, no doubt, made what men call a fortune, easily, as men daily did around me, but for all their mines of gold I would not have delayed one hour to see those who alone filled my heart. For this alone I toiled, labored, with supernatural strength, did double work, till I had sufficient to pay my passage and take me home. I clutched the paltry sum with the greediness and delight with which the men around me grasped the heavy bars of gold that were to make them rich. Home, Clara, my native country, were my riches, far surpassing theirs. And so I sailed. As I paced the deck, what projects did I not form of atonement to my Clara, could she but forgive me! and, Mary, I felt she would, for I knew her nature, that I had never doubted, not in my maddest moments. I felt new powers growing in my heart; my very brain seemed to expand, I felt like one inspired, inspired by repentance, purified by suffering, and fitted to achieve all, every thing, for the sake of the dear angels to whom I should now devote my life.</p> 
               <p>"The shores of America were reached at last. My foot once more trod the ground of my native land-but my house was desolate, strangers were in my home, my home no longer. Clara, <emph>my</emph> guardian angel, was gone, all traces of her and of her child were lost. I found too that my partners in the Evening Journal had taken advantage of my absence, to cast foul accusations on my honor and my name. They were false, Mary, lies invented not so much to destroy me, as to give all I possessed into the hands of those thus really guilty of the crimes they charged on me. But I cared not, I had but one hope, one ambition, one care, one desire, to see my wife, to find her, to fall at her feet, to strain her to my heart, and then if she forgave me, to win fame and fortune, which I felt I could, and to shield her evermore from evil and the ruthless world. I sought in vain; this first disappointment almost killed me, but there was still one faint hope fluttering at the bottom of my heart-you, Mary-I knew that if she lived, if I had not killed her, your child would seek a refuge in your arms; I knew where to find you, once more I was on the deep waters, and<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7216-00000197"/> I came, trembling with fear, sick with uncertainty, to you."</p> 
               <p>"And here, Harry, you have found rest and love for evermore, have you not?"</p> 
               <p>"Who shall say, Mary? Clara, beloved angel, took me to her heart without one look, one word of reproach; never has she appeared to remember the past; but, Mary, what am I now in her life? Nothing-her life was complete without; me my talents, such as they were, have lost the power which inspired them-I can do nothing for my beloved; my child even is rich, and has many to love her, she needs not a father's love-my life is useless. Her father blushes for his son-in-law, so unworthy a husband for his beautiful and refined daughter; oh Mary! would that I had died-I am an incumbrance to the earth-what have I to live for now?"</p> 
               <p>As Harry uttered these words, Marie bounded through the window from the lawn, and laughing, and breathless, threw herself into her father's arms-then as she nestled closely to him she looked behind her, exclaiming,</p> 
               <p>"I got him first, didn't I, aunt Mary? Mamma couldn't catch me, she goes so slow, Marie runs fastest; hold me tight, papa, here she comes," and as she spoke Clara appeared. Standing in the open door she held up her finger smilingly, at Marie and her father, then untieing her bonnet and throwing off her scarf, she exclaimed,</p> 
               <p>"I'm coming, Marie, I'm coming, you sha'n't have all papa, I can tell you, though you did win the race."</p> 
               <p>Clara, now coming up to the group, imprinted a kiss on Mary's forehead, and then kneeling before her husband and her child, she encircled both in her arms, and playfully laying her head on her child's lap, as it sat on its father's knee, she said:</p> 
               <p>"If you won't give me papa, Marie darling, why I'll take you both at once, that's all;" and Clara with her deep, truthful eyes looked up smilingly at Harry.</p> 
               <p>Harry, remembering his last words, avoided her look and buried his face in the luxuriant ringlets of his child.</p> 
               <p>Clara, who watched and read all the expressions of her husband's ever-varying features, still kneeling at his feet, looked inquiringly towards Mary.</p> 
               <p>"Harry was asking me, Clara, when you came, what he had to live for now," said Mary, rising; "he thinks he but cumbers the earth, that he is nothing in the lives of those he loves."</p> 
               <p>Clara rose instantly to her feet, and the color forsook her cheek-then motioning to Marie, she said with a quivering voice,</p> 
               <pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7216-00000198"/> 
               <p>"Take her away."</p> 
               <p>Mary, unwinding the child's arms from her father's neck, took it by the hand and led it gently from the room, putting the large bouquet of flowers she had brought with her into its hands, to arrest the tears which had gathered in the large, serious eyes at this sudden dismissal.</p> 
               <p>When the door closed after them, Clara threw herself into Harry's arms, and Harry resting his head on her shoulder, burst into a passionate flood of tears.</p> 
               <p>Clara allowed him to weep unrestrainedly for some time, then as he grew calmer, putting her lips close to his ear, and gently wiping the tears which fell from his eyes and the drops of perspiration which stood on his forehead, she whispered, in accents of deep tenderness-</p> 
               <p>"For what should my Harry live! for me, for his child, for love, but not alone for love. That is not man's mission-it is woman's, but not man's. God has so decreed it, my beloved. Whatever we may be, 'tis love alone should make us heroines, martyrs, or guide us in the sweeter, humbler paths of woman's life. Genius, when bestowed on woman, how dangerous the gift, if not restrained and guided by a deep and steady love! Yes, Harry, from her cradle to her grave, woman lives but in her love. When lying on her mother's breast, she gazes so trustingly on the first face she learns to know, the holy love of a mother guides her; till comes the love of her life, her destiny, her lover, and far holier still than the lover, her honored husband.</p> 
               <p>"Nor let woman think her part in life is abject or humble; love is her destiny, but in her hands she holds the destiny of him she loves.</p> 
               <p>"Is that love but the counterfeit of that deep, all-suffering, unchanging passion? Woman will make the man she loves, her plaything and her slave-bind him by silken chains to her and her alone-crushing all energies, all power, all genius, that takes him from her, or gives him occupation, distinction and fame, in which she bears no part.</p> 
               <p>"But this is not love, Harry-the love I feel for you, the love which is my destiny, and is all the fame I ask, all the distinction I claim. Loving you thus Harry, I have holy duties to fulfill; and I say to you, Harry Rushton, arise! God has given you talents, eloquence, power, the power of the modern world, the eloquence of the pen. He has given you energy, intellect, genius. All these he has but lent to you, and but for one purpose, for the good of your fellow-men, for the glory of your country, for the manifestation of his noblest work, man, in you.<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7216-00000199"/> Arise, then, my Harry! In the days of chivalry, women sent their knights forth to battle; I send you forth to combat in the battle of life-and I am happier, Harry, far than they, for I can share your struggles and your dangers-nay, spare you many-support you, even counsel you, and keep you such a haven of peace and love to reward you, that you shall stand proudly up before them all, defying all that makes men shrink or falter; for you will have to shield from you the wearying, petty cares of life, unworthy of man and genius, the love of one whose very pulse of life you are."</p> 
               <p>As Clara proceeded, Harry had raised his head from her shoulder, and gazing intently at her as she spoke, his eye began to glisten, he threw his head proudly back, his very form seemed to grow taller and to expand, as he stood before her.</p> 
               <p>"With that love, Clara, I can achieve all; but oh, my beloved, forgive, and from the depths of your noble soul answer me-is it love, not duty, makes you thus speak to me?"</p> 
               <p>"Duty, Harry, might perhaps have made me thus speak to you, but I have never heard its voice; as yet love alone, Harry, deep, passionate, fervent love for you, has ever spoken too loud in my soul, for me to hear another voice. Yes, naughty Harry," continued she, with a playful smile, "every body has loved him here as foolishly as his Clara, and we have all watched him, and-"</p> 
               <p>"And some have doubted me," interrupted Harry.</p> 
               <p>"Not your wife-but she, who knows you best, knew that the fiery spirit was dying of inaction-so, not loving you the less, my life, that you had noble instincts of genius and usefulness within you, but glorying in you the more, I and my dearest father have formed a little secret plot together. To-day it was to have been revealed to you-listen to it now.</p> 
               <p>"Much as I love the land where Mary is-much as I reverence the beautiful country which gave me birth, neither is my own country. The country which gave you birth is mine; from the hour I loved you, Harry, I, like you, became a citizen of your fair and free America. My father, who has but me, but us to love, who is forever an exile from his beautiful land, will too, seek a home in the young republic, such as was his dream to found in his own suffering and enslaved Italy.</p> 
               <p>"He has transferred his funds to the United States; he has endowed you, for you know he is only an American in heart, and could not himself possess the soil, with broad lands in the loveliest portion of the United States-in Florida. So, Harry, throw away<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC7216-00000200"/> forever from your tender, sensitive mind all that is galling in the past. You are rich, and you go back to your country, with all the duties that riches and citizenship impose. From such as you, Harry, does your young country look for writers to guide the minds of its people, and to become its legislators or its representatives in other nations. Never let another cloud arise between us-nor, Harry," and here sweet Clara spoke solemnly and slow, "never let a name that separated us, re-echo in your heart. From mine it is banished long since forever. Must I not be indulgent to you, if she so lured and blinded you? Was not I myself deceived by her artful seeming, even though we dwelt beneath the same roof? Think no more of her-leave vengeance to her own passions and Heaven. She will never more cross our path."</p> 
               <p>Harry clasped her to his heart-then Clara resumed, in a cheerful tone, "come to our father-oh, he has so much to tell you-for he loves you!"</p> 
               <p>"For your sake, then, dearest-"</p> 
               <p>"No, for your own, Harry. He has watched the workings of your soul, and I speak his words, not mine you know, dear Harry-he says he has learned to reverence, to admire you; that finding all so happy, all so prosperous, the past could not so soon be banished from your heart, and-but never mind how it came to pass-he loves you as a son. In a few weeks we shall sail for America; and there, Harry, set your foot proudly on its free shore, for life will begin for you anew.</p> 
               <p>"And remember how you have struggled, how you have succumbed, for want of the paltry gold of which dull mediocrity makes a shield to deaden the soaring arrows of genius. We have it now."</p> 
               <p>"And confidence, unbounded, in each other, dearest life!" exclaimed Harry, with the thrilling voice, the sparkling eyes of other days; "and with love, such as yours, you shall see how I will shape my life. I have always groveled at another's feet, my genius cramped by another's will, my very thoughts and feelings bartered for a daily pittance. Now I can soar on my own wings, and you shall see to what proud heights they will bear me; so that perhaps men may think I almost deserved to be my Clara's husband. Come to your father, dearest; we will make no vows nor promises, on this our second marriage day; but tempered by sorrow, humbly submitting to heaven the future, we will kneel and ask a father's blessing on the new life, God's mercy and your pure love have thus reserved for us."</p>

               </epigraph> 
               <p>"COLONEL," exclaimed a lady in a tone of command far more befitting the Colonel at the head of his regiment, than the Colonel's lady, "Colonel, take care of Adolphus George, and pray don't drag my beautiful <emph>gim</emph>pure shawl in the dust-oh dear, but it's hard work, sight-seeing, and all for to come and see a stupid, melancholy cemetery; well I never did-"</p> 
               <p>The gentleman addressed as the Colonel, who was walking before the lady who spoke to him, was no other than our old acquaintance, Colonel Horatio C. Stubbins, editor, when we knew him, of the "Vertical Ray," But the Vertical Ray has long since ceased to pierce the souls of its readers, it has set forever, But "the Colonel" has been editor of innumerable successors of that spicy little paper, none of which however have been very long-lived, but the Colonel, with undaunted boldness and perseverance befitting a military editor, has never deserted his flag. Scarcely was one decease announced, before a flaming prospectus with Horatio C. Stubbins' name in larger and more fantastic characters than ever, assured the anxious public, that the editor had not expired with his paper.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Horatio C. Stubbins is however, we must confess, much changed from the exceedingly grand specimen of the "fast man about town" he presented, when first we were introduced to him. He has entirely lost the flashy air, the bold bearing of former times; his dress is plain and somewhat shabby, and carelessly put on, as though he didn't much care about how Colonel Horatio C. Stubbins looked; he who before thought that the only important thing in life, was to contribute to the comfort and glorification of the said Horatio Stubbins. Altogether he has a <emph>cowed</emph> appearance; he has grown thinner and he stoops. The truth is, that if this gallant Colonel has failed in many of his enterprises, if he has not yet succeeded in finding the headquarters of his, regiment, he most surely has accomplished one thing-he has found a commander: an able general, a severe disciplinarian, one too who keeps him on half pay, makes him work hard, and scolds him all the time.</p> 
               <pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7216-00000202"/> 
               <p>Now, the commander and conqueror of this illustrious, bold and bullying editor, is no less a person than the charming Miss Esther Jenkins, converted in an unguarded moment (Mars himself was known to sleep) into a legal, real Mrs. Stubbins.</p> 
               <p>MRS. COLONEL ESTHER STUBBINS, as the lady has it on her highly-glazed and richly-embossed visiting card, is now before us-a grand sight to behold, that cannot be denied.</p> 
               <p>She is no longer the slim, fragile, fine lady we once knew her-she has given up the die-away-airs of the interesting, appealing-for-protection young lady and has assumed the majestic. This change, suggested by her exaltation, was almost rendered necessary by the stately proportions to which her form had expanded. Magnificent too was her attire-her skirts so wide, her flounces so many-and of silk so rich and rustling: her moire-antique mantilla cast so exactly in the right place <emph>off</emph> the shoulders. The wilderness of embroidery, lace and brooches which vailed her bosom on which a splendid diamond brooch reposed in sullen splendor, which brooch, since Esther had possessed it, she wore morning and evening. "What's the good of having things if you don't show them?" a truism which was undeniable.</p> 
               <p>Lace and embroidery were not spared on the ample arm, nor were the bracelets, nor the rings, on the fat white fingers, both being, on Esther's principle of putting things to their proper uses, fully displayed by the very thinnest of black mittens. Her bonnet-but here description fails-suffice it to say, that it served as a very effective back-ground to the very fullest of puffed bandeaux, becomingly arranged on each side of the white forehead, harmonizing well with the very pretty face most admirably <emph>made up</emph> with a judicious application of pearl powder and rouge. The brilliant eyes looked triumphantly and boldly around, and Mrs. Colonel Esther, holding her pink moire-antique parasol over head with the air of a duchess, trod the dusty road leading to the gate of Laurel Hill cemetery, with the importance and self-possession of an empress.</p> 
               <p>The Colonel carried his commander's guipure or <emph>gim</emph>pure shawl, as she called it-and a small basket containing refreshment, for which Esther had retained her former taste-from his pocket protruded the pink and silver tassel of her fan. In the other hand he held, or rather dragged along Adolphus George, a cross, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">blas,</foreign> exhausted boy of about six years old, sole hope of his house, whom it was his mother's occupation alternately to bully and indulge, but always to dress in the very height of fashion.</p> 
               <pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7216-00000203"/> 
               <p>"I don't see them tiresome people," exclaimed our Esther, in her old picturesque phraseology; "I declare if this is what they call <emph>a party de champagne,</emph> now I know what it is, you won't catch me at it again; it's all your fault though. Colonel."</p> 
               <p>"My fault!" replied the Colonel turning his head, "my fault! why you know you were not ready when the de la Mottes started, and-"</p> 
               <p>"Why wasn't I ready, Colonel Stubbins, I should like to know? Answer me that. Why wasn't I ready? Why because you staid a smoking and a talking on them hotel steps, and never came to tell me what o'clock it was, and how was I to know?"</p> 
               <p>"Why you've got a watch-"</p> 
               <p>"A watch! you know it don't go, only just when it likes."</p> 
               <p>"Well, my dear, that's because you would take that small Geneva thing; the man told you it wouldn't go like those plain flat Paris made-"</p> 
               <p>"Plain Paris made indeed, Colonel Stubbins! Do you think I was a going to take a nasty plain thing like them Paris watches? How do you think that would match all my other splendid jewelry?"</p> 
               <p>They now reached the gate of the cemetery, and on inquiring of the keeper, they found that, with all the politeness of a Frenchman, their new acquaintance, M. de la Motte, had left word of their arrival and their whereabouts.</p> 
               <p>Somewhat soothed by this announcement, Mrs. Colonel Stubbins smoothed her garments and her temper, pulled down Adolphus George's collar, and adjusted his jaunty hat, jerking him all the while by the chin and bidding him take care and behave himself, or she would skin him, when they got home. Then, at her peremptory word of command, the Colonel most obediently offered his arm, and, in this "genteel manner," as Esther called it, they proceeded to join their party.</p> 
               <p>We will not follow them; but straying through the most picturesque alleys of the calm and lovely abode of the dead, we will seek that portion overshadowed by thick waving trees, rising amidst the rocks and overlooking the silvery, rapid river, which rolls heedless and bright, before the dwellings of the living and the dead.</p> 
               <p>Here are few monuments, for ostentation seeks more the public paths in which to raise its monumental marbles-but there are some who have commemorated the dead for themselves alone, memorials of grief and love, which shrinking from the indifferent and the curious, ponder by the rapid river, beneath the thick waving trees, and gazing on the name engraven now but in two places in the world, the unalterable stone<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7216-00000204"/> and the hearts that once loved to speak it, the bereft ones think o'er the tender memories of the past, and dream of heaven.</p> 
               <p>In this retreat from the world of the dead beyond, where pleasure-seekers are inspecting the monuments, calculating their cost, and speculating on the various inscriptions, there is a beautiful white marble column, surrounded by an inclosure filled with the rarest flowers, all now in full bloom. The perfumed myrtle, in twining luxuriance, conceals the iron railing round the monument; roses of every hue bloom in rich profusion, and the orange-trees crowded round the base of the column, recall, as their powerful penetrating scent is borne on the breeze, the fair land of Italy.</p> 
               <p>The inscription, too, on the column, is in a foreign language, the soft language of the land of art and song, but alas, like all other languages, of sorrow also: <q>
                     <p>GINEVRA.<lb/> "IN CIELO RICORDATI DEL NOSTRO AMORE."<lb/> 
                        <hi rend="i"/>In the Heaven, where you dwell, forget not our love on earth.</p>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>And near this garden, seated on the turf, speaking in sweet, low tones to her father, who sits beside her, gazing with tearful, solemn glance on the funeral column, is our Clara. How noble, how beautiful, how pure she looks now, in the full meridian of womanhood, every trace of youth's sorrow vanished from her brow, where truth and intellect combine to characterize and dignify the classical purity of all the other features! She murmurs low, sweet words of consolation to her father, she speaks to him of her mother, and never wearying of the tale, relates her love, her sufferings, her devotion and her death.</p> 
               <p>And San Giusto grows calm as he listens, and his eyes, from the monument, are often raised to Heaven as his child spoke of their loved one's immortal happiness and rest-tells of their meeting there, where love is eternal, and knows no chance or change.</p> 
               <p>But in the pauses of her gentle words, a merry, childish laugh was borne towards them, and a deep manly voice, speaking in suppressed tones, would reach her ear, and then the pensive look would vanish from her face, for an instant her eye would brighten, and a smile hover on her lips. They were the voices of her Harry and his child, his last-born, his son, of whom Harry Rushton was not a little proud-for this toddling boy, a fair, fat, curly-headed creature of some three years did, looking on him with his own brown sparkling eyes, peeping through a wilderness of flaxen ringlets, he already predicted honors, distinction, and fortunes, such as fairy godmothers bestow in fairy tales on the children of some fairy-favored princess.</p> 
               <pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC7216-00000205"/> 
               <p>Harry, as there are no fairies now, has himself begun to work at the fortunes he has carved out for his child. He has become one of the leading men of his country; his clear and brilliant intellect, taken from the drudgery of the pen, now shines in the arena of politics, its proper sphere, and his party look with reliance on Harry Rushton as their head and chief-and all Harry's happy spirits have returned, and his bright wit and his manners, polished by love, happiness and the refinements of a high-toned home, make him the most popular man of his day. Harry has been sent to Congress, and when he speaks, there is not a vacant place in hall or gallery, for his fervid, brilliant, pithy speeches, are the delight of all. The ladies especially, who, even if they don't quite appreciate all he says, fully understand how very handsome he looks. Under the influence of love, restored to his self-respect, in the full exercise of all the faculties of his mind, with pursuits and ambitions congenial to his tastes, Harry now more than ever deserves the appellation of "Handsome Harry."</p> 
               <p>He and Clara have just returned from Washington, after a most brilliant and successful season, in which Harry has attracted the attention of the highest and most venerated men of his country.</p> 
               <p>On their return to America, San Giusto had sought with unwearying perseverance, the place where the remains of his Ginevra had been deposited by the hands of public charity. He had at length, by finding the men employed in the miserable funeral, and recalling to them every circumstance of the burial, succeeded in gaining possession of the coffin containing the remains of his unhappy and adored wife.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Judy Mullens, brought to Philadelphia for that purpose, had ferreted out every one likely to remember the circumstances of the "forrin lady's burial," and when the coffin, now crumbling to dust, was found, she had watched its inclosure in the leaden coffins prepared for it, nor left it till with her own eyes she had seen them soldered down, so that she could assure her "dear Clary" that it was indeed her mother that was, with unostentatious pomp, conveyed to the eternal restingplace, prepared by a husband's care to receive it, in the cemetery of Laurel Hill.</p> 
               <p>It was San Giusto's last and sad consolation to raise this monument to his Ginevra, thus to see her name not quite obliterated from the earth. Once every year he would come from the magnificent home he had created for himself and his children on the broad lands they had purchased in Florida. With <emph>her</emph> child, the child in whose arms she had died, and her child's children, he came to look on the unchanged marble, to<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7216-00000206"/> whisper the beloved name as he gazed, and communing with the gentle spirit, he felt hovered around him, he would pray for their reunion in another world. These visits brought no renewal of violent sorrow; they soothed, they consoled him. She indeed had suffered, but San Giusto had deep faith, and he knew that now she had her reward. Conversing with her image on earth, his Chiara of other and brighter days, telling to that sweet child, a woman now, tried in life's burning furnace, all the calm happiness of their union, all the agonies of their separation. And so for hours had they now discoursed, and San Giusto, leaning back against the tree at the foot of which they sat, signed to his daughter to join her husband and her child that he might sit, and meditate and pray alone, before they bid it farewell, by the tomb of his Ginevra.</p> 
               <p>Clara stole gently and noiselessly from him, and guided by the little prattling voice, soon came to where Harry and his boy were rolling side by side on a plot of green sward.</p> 
               <p>"Which is the baby?" said Clara, looking down on them as, perceiving mamma, they stopped their gambols and lay perfectly quiet, the boy nestling his head in his father's bosom, in pretended affright.</p> 
               <p>"I'se a man," shouted the boy, looking quickly up.</p> 
               <p>"I do believe he is stronger than any boy of his age," said Rushton; "why he almost knocked me down. I'm tired to death with running after him; it's quite astonishing how fast he runs."</p> 
               <p>"Oh no, Harry, it isn't," replied Clara; "you know altogether little Albert is the most astonishing boy ever seen, at least in the eyes of his foolish father. Come, Ally dear, leave papa to go to sleep, and come with mamma and she will show you the beautiful shining river, and the steamers, and little tiny boats, and green trees dipping into the waters."</p> 
               <p>Albert, listening with intent eagerness to all these wonders, gave his hand to his mother, and together they clambered up the steep rocky hill till they stood together on the very top, and as Clara had promised, looked down on the silvery Schuylkill, where skiffs with their white outspread sails, were sailing rapidly and silently by the opposite shore, so green and thickly wooded. There was scarce a breeze to move the summer leaf-the heavens were bright and cloudless, and spoke of calm and repose. The hour and the scene had their influence on Clara, and even on the heedless, happy child-clinging tightly to his mother, he looked over the high beetling cliff and watched the rapid, sparkling waters as they danced along. Clara, whose thoughts were ever high and heaven-directed when in meditation, thought how fair the earth was and how like a heaven<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC7216-00000207"/> God had made it, till rude and cruel passions changed its aspect and perverted its beauties and its gifts. But Albert, whose mood was ever changing, soon grew tired of the sparkling waters, and having ascertained that his mother could by no means give him one of the little boats he saw in the distance, he turned away and looked at the objects within his reach. Presently, with a little shout of joy, he pointed to some gay and brilliant flowers, growing amidst a heap of tangled brushwood on a mound at some little distance from where they stood.</p> 
               <p>It was far enough from the brink of the cliff, to preclude all danger, and so Clara replied by an affirmative nod, to the eager demand of whether "Albert might go and get the pretty flowers."</p> 
               <p>Off bounded the child; Clara, reclining against a jutting piece of rock, turned to watch him. But there is no pleasure for childhood unless there are some to share it, and soon Albert, his tiny hands full of bright flowers, began to shout to his mamma to come.</p> 
               <p>Clara rose and obeyed the oft-repeated summons-she found that the "bright flowers" the child had gathered, grew mid the tangled weeds and brushwood, which almost covered a large stone of black marble laid flat on the soil-which served to mark the resting-place of one who lay in this wilderness far from all others, untended and forgotten.</p> 
                
               <p>The upper part of the stone was entirely concealed beneath the branches which had grown over it, but Clara, on stooping down, perceived that though encrusted with moss and mildew, the letters indelibly cut in the stone, were still legible.</p> 
               <p>She bent down lower still, and rubbing away the moss with her hand, she read: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"Oh breathe not her name: let it sleep in the shade,</l> 
                        <l>Where, cold and unhonored, her relics are laid."</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>As Clara read these words, an undefined feeling of terror and horror came over her. She sat down by this grave, indeed neglected and unhonored, and wondered who had so lived, as that none should shed one tear over her grave, now that she was dead and gone-and Clara, one hand resting on the marble, her eyes fixed on the ground, remained lost in thought.</p> 
               <p>Albert, meanwhile, after having with his little fingers pointed out in the inscription the letters he knew, throwing the flowers he had gathered into his mother's lap, diligently proceeded to gather the rest. Lying flat on the stone he tugged at the tangled branches of brushwood, till suddenly he exclaimed, turning his head towards his mother and holding back a long branch,</p> 
               <pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC7216-00000208"/> 
               <p>"Mamma, mamma; more letters, more letters; see."</p> 
               <p>Clara looked to where he pointed, and there she read with distended eye and suspended breath the word <q>
                     <p>CAROLINE.</p>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>She snatched the child up from where he lay; his hand letting go its hold on the branch he held, the weeds and flowers again fell over, and again concealed the fatal name. Then Clara, taking her child up in her arms, threw the flowers he still held far from her, and with tottering step, as though pursued by the living Caroline, she hurried away.</p> 
               <p>The child, affrighted at his mother's abruptness, first clung to her, then seeing her pale and trembling, he began to cry.</p> 
               <p>Aroused from her panic by the sound, Clara looked up with a smile, and she saw Harry coming towards her, and she held the boy out to him, and her heart grew calm and her strength returned.</p> 
               <p>"Here, Harry," said she, "take your boy and go to my father-I have forgotten something there on that bank-I will join you instantly."</p> 
               <p>Harry took his boy, and she heard them, as they descended the steep, chattering gaily and joyously, and her boy's light merry laugh was borne on the breeze towards her; and with slow step she turned and sought the grave, <q>
                     <l>Where, cold and unhonored, her relics <emph>were</emph> laid.</l>
                  </q> When she came near it, she knelt by it, and the remembrance of past years came before her, and the form now resting thus beneath this neglected stone, rose before her in its hours of triumphant pride and beauty, and she thought of the toil, the intrigues, the falsehood, the crime, through which, misled by evil passions, by arrogant self-reliance and by a scornful disdain of God and his laws, this woman, who had been once the world's idol, had passed; she thought of the love she had spurned, of the bright destiny she had thrown from her, of the friendship she had betrayed-and all but to end in this untended and unhallowed grave, far from the living, apart even from the other dead-and Clara's soul was filled with sorrow and deep pity-and as she knelt, the sounds of mirthful music from a passing pleasure boat, were borne towards her, and now they grew louder and louder, and were mingled with the sound of many voices, and distant merriment, but soon they became fainter, as the boat passed, unheeding the silent habitation of the dead, and growing fainter and fainter, till they vanished in the far distance from the ear.</p> 
               <pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC7216-00000209"/> 
               <p>"Alas, Caroline," said Clara, bending over the grave, "such was the vain dream for which you struggled; scarcely longer did it last than that strain of music, which for one moment disturbed the solemn silence of this place and was then gone forever-leaving nothing behind. Poor Caroline-here in thy forsaken, unknown grave, dost thou atone for all, and I, happy, blessed in this world, a wife beloved, and a joyous mother, shall I reproach you? No, I forgive you all your treachery to me, and, kneeling by your grave, I implore that Heaven may, too, have mercy and forgive your crimes."</p> 
               <p>Then, gathering up the flowers her child had culled and she had scattered, she bound them together and laid them on the grave; gently, and as though fearing to disturb the ashes beneath, she cleared away the brushwood and the weeds, and, gazing on the name now visible to all, she knelt once more beside it and a tear of pity and forgiveness fell on the cold, neglected stone. Then, rising with slow and solemn step, she turned away, and Caroline and Clara were parted forever in this world.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head> 
               <p>THE next day, San Giusto, Clara and Rushton, left Philadelphia for their home.</p> 
               <p>Those who have never been to Florida, do well to rave of the climate of Italy. Those who have, recall rather the limpid, balmy beauty of the Atlantic coast, than the fervid heats and parched shores of the Mediterranean. Here, in this land where the adventurous Spaniard sought the fountain of perpetual youth, spring, in its mildest and most bewitching aspects, reigns throughout the year. It was this peculiar quality and healthfulness of the climate, which gave rise to this fable-for in truth, sickness in this region is almost unknown, save in the unfortunate and deathstricken victims of consumption, who come every year<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC7216-00000210"/> to gaze upon the exquisite beauty of this clime, and drink in its pure and delicious atmosphere-and then bid farewell to earth.</p> 
               <p>Harry had shown a true knowledge of the topography of his country, in fixing upon his future home. He had chosen well. In all the world, perhaps no spot can be found uniting so many of the elements of a peaceful, happy and healthful life, as the neighborhood of St. Augustine. Here every flower, every fruit, every production of nature, grows in spontaneous abundance, and the climate is so soft and equal, that every breath imparts a positive pleasure to the frame, and the mere sense of physical existence is in itself a happiness. Here, in an old Spanish-built house, surrounded by groves of orange and lime trees, and whose uncouth proportions were concealed in a profusion of flowering and sweet-scented vines, they had established the Eden of their earthly life. All that art and taste could add, to complete the charms of this retreat of love, happiness and virtue, had been supplied by the care of San Giusto.</p> 
               <p>It was indeed a paradise, and though Clara always longed for her home, she yearned for it this time with unusual longing, for there Mary and her own sweet Marie awaited her.</p> 
                
               <p>Marie had now reached the age of Clara herself, when first we saw her watching, in poverty and sorrow, by the death-bed of her mother; but wealth and happiness attended her happy childhood, and love and care guided her first steps in life. In this lovely home, so peaceful, far removed from all the vanity and corruption of the world, and evil example, was Marie educated, under the care of teachers chosen by Mary, who now had come from England to see her darlings.</p> 
               <p>It was at the close of the day, that Marie sat in the high-arched porch, watching for the arrival of her mother. The gorgeous sky, in all the splendor of a summer sunset, lighted the luxuriant vegetation, and the flowers with their brilliant hues, lifted their heads after the heat of day, exhaling all their perfumes.
