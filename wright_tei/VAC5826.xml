'NEW YO RK: HARPER &amp; BROTHERS, PUBLISHERS, FRANKLIN SQUARE.  187l. I'.a^f $7 I    <pb n="" xml:id="VAC5826-00000002"/> Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1871, by HARPER &amp; BROTHERS, In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.   PREFACE. TrHS story bf a summer holiday, dedicated to all idlers and holiday- seekers, is the normal outgrowth of a restful mood-the fruit gathered in the leisurely moments of a long play-day when there seemed nothing better to do. The action of the book, drowsy with the languor of summer, quickened a little now and then by the sea-breezes, moves on with the easy footsteps of unhurried rural life; and there is no more thought of a moral in it than there is in the plays of children and the friskiness of all young animals; or in the unreckoning content of comfortable, every-day enjoy- ment in our maturer years. We talk sometimes of "holding the mirror up to Nature;" but there was not even so much of effort in the present narrative. Nature held her mirror up to me; and looking in there, I saw all these things as herein narrated. It was once upon a time when I was an idler upon the sea-shore, surrounded by a little band of friends and kindred. There was a venerable, beloved form, wedded henceforth to all sea-side memories, but hidden now from all our eyes by the thick veil of the future; there was a pleasant maiden, now three thousand miles away, look- ing out upon old ocean from the English coast; there were other young girls, just escaped from the school-room, and one, weary with the early experiences of the teacher; there was manhood dropping out from business into holiday, and troops of children eager for new scenes. There were captains, and sailors, and fishermen-farmers: their wives and children;- many of them as pleasant to remember as the lingering echoes of the sea- shore itself. But not one of all these has found a place here in my book. The pictures drawn in the following pages are only broken reflections of the real objects as I saw them mirrored in the little pools among the rocks,  where there was almost always a disturbing ripple from the sea-breezes  and where the tides swept over often enough to break into fragments many, of the veritable images which I should like very much to have preserve The people about me were often reflected in these delightful mirrors-passe    <pb n="vi-vii (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC5826-00000003"/> Vi              PREFACE. ing to and fro--sitting dreamily upon the sands--perched about on the cliffil or grouped farther off along the breezy downs; but I knew that, under the circumstances, it would be - possible. to give nothing better than very dis. torted likenesses, and so forbore to make even the slightest attempt at por- traitume But gradually, as I looked, all these other people of the story began to gaze out at me from the hidden depths below. Where they came from, I don't know. They were all new acquaintances; yet in time they grew more real and tangible to me than any of the flesh-and-blood folks about us. They wont with us everywhere, taking a share in every thing which we did, and doing many other things of their own free will, in which the rest of us had no atnrlt In the main, their characters seemed to be genuine and'sincere', yet they were sometimes guilty of a little masquer- ading-none of them ever hesitating to appropriate either the words, or deeds, or garments, or even the spirit and manners, of their betters, when this suited their own purposes. If any one of our summer friends, therefore, should ever recognize his own property, let him have it by all means; but he will probably flnd it piecemeal--stray bits bere and there in the possession of either of the dra. =68.spersoncc of these mystic Island Neighbors. They have perhaps unwit- tingly borrowed it merely for the occasion, and will return it always with the readiest good-will. A. B. B.    CONTENTS',. CHAPTER 1.

CHAPTER I. ON THE SAND-BAR.   "T HE quickest sail you ever made, isn't Lit, Capting Percy?" said old Captain Giles, passenger. "La, no! I've come over under two hours. We've done well to-day, though; and had a pleasant social time all round. Now if we can only get over the bar to anchor, the boats will take us up to your house, ma'am, by three or four o'clock," turning deferentially to the "Bos- ton lady." "We shall all be very glad indeed," she re- plied, graciously. This Boston lady, Mrs. Warner, was a pleas- ant, polite, middle-aged, rather pale and lan- guid woman, who was accompanied by an in- valid husband, a grown son, two young daugh- ters, and Margaret-waiting-maid and compan- ion. They were on their way to spend the summer in a primitive niche of tlxis out-of-the- way island, where they had taken a little fur- nished cottage by the sea-side. Mr. Warner was a man hardly past middle life; but years of suffering and infirmity, while they had left one sunny side to his character, had added also a shady one-like an apple which has ripened unequally: smooth and de- licious-looking, from one point of view, but gnarled and a little worm-eaten, from the other. "The sail has been very pleasant," he said, with condescension; " but I am just getting so tired-so tired!" His voice had gone up an octave in the last clause of his sentence, and it fell on the ear as plaintively as a sick girl's. He gave it further emphasis by shutting his eyes, folding his hands, and drawing a long, weary breath.  The only other passenger was jolly old Cap- tain Giles-already in his seventy-ninth year. This aged salt was as shrivelled as a cucumber   t after it has lain long in the brine; and, like that, i he had not touched vinegar yet, but was pliant, tough, and sweet, in mind and body through.  out. n  For a few minutes every one sat silent, at- tentive, and trusting; while the little sloop I tacked, gathering up all her final energies for her last expected feat of the day-that of pass- - ing triumphantly over the hir. "There! aground! We're aground I Don't you see, capting, we're aground?" roared the aged passenger, his voice rising like a spirt of effervescence from a suddenly-uncorked bottle -  "Yes, I see," muttered Captain Percy. "U-u-ugh!" sputtered red-haired Alfred Brand, in Oane of excessive disgust. He sud- denly dropped the rope with which he had been managing the sail, shaking his fingers as if it had burnt his hand. The invalid groaned, and re-closed the eyes that had opened from the recesses of a nodding nap; the lady, children, and Margaret all looked, more curious than alarmed-and rather eager,  as it seemed, at the promise of a little adven- ture. Letting go the rudder, the captain strode forward, his lips blown into a funnel for whis- tling; yet the sound held back, as if in sympa- thy with the condition of his sloop. "Well, there is no time to lose; tide is falling every minute. We are strong-handed, and we must work her off." Up sprang Captain Giles as eagerly as if the distressed sloop had been his own. Alfred, whose bunk was inside the little cabin, and who was himself both first mate and crew, after clap. ping his hands in a dumb show of regret and apology, unconsciously looking hard at Mar. garet, who looked back her assurance of his in- nocence of misdoing, if any such existed, seized    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5826-00000006"/> oars and poles, which he began distributing toI the two captains.              t "The Dickens! Let me, help too," cried  young Frank Warner, disregarding a pull on A either side from father and mother; each try- ing furtively to hold him back, thrusting one end of the oar into the sand, I the four men leaned forward, and all shoved to- s ether heroically. "She moves! she moves a g little!".was shouted hopefully ; but she did not I move, nevertheless; or if she did, it was only to -edge her way a little bigger up on the sandsI with a, miserly grip at every incoming wave. I I' Ill help,'pllease, captain," said Margaret, dropping off her shawl and taking her place  without ado, amidst the -protest and the admi-  ration of the sailors. But the sloop had taken! her stand also, and she was able to maintain it against them all. "We must lighten her! Bring up the boat, AlE. Now row the ladies and the gentleman ash ore."' Alfred sprung into the row-boat, which was conveniently towing behind, and the passen- giers were almost as speedily transferred, poor Mi. Warlner grumbling aind lamenting in so undecided a manner' that if the two captains had not each lent him an arm, with- that kind of imperativeness which mca'ns, "We are in earnest, and no time to spare"' he would hnrrd- ly have found the energy to step into the un- stable smaller craft. ctDon't be dliscouraged, sir I We'll all help you to take bold of lif6 with your right band yet, sir," said Captain Giles, as he took his seat- also, grasping one p-air of oars. Malrgaret, who had been handing over boxes and baskets with- out ceasing, quietly said, "Let, me stay and help. i can shove with the best of you." "No," was the general verdict; but there was a brightening of eyes under all the bronzed foreheads.  "I sliall need your help sadly, Margaret," called the invalid; so Margaret stepped- into the boat, and was rowed ashore with the others. Wiflf long; strokes of the oars, Alfred and Captain Giles returned to the sloop, and once again the four men strained every nerve to shove her off. II We' must unload." Trunks and barrels were lifted over into the boat, Frrtnk Warner working with the others, wholly unmindful of broadcloth. - Meantime the children ran about the sands in ready glee, gathering the pretty shells and stones, while their parents shivered disconso- lately.  H 3ow cold it is 1" said the lady, wrap-   pitig herself closer in herlanrge shawl. Il Ihope the salt-water won't take the color out of mv dress. They splashed me dreadfully when the Atwo boats came together." Margaret loled down at her own best green embroidered gown. The wanve had dipped over her also, half filling her lap. She shook it off, saying nothing at the time; and now she only gave another silent shake, and helped the inva- lid on with -an additional overcoat.. II Won't you have a seat made on-the sand,. Mr. Warner? There's a lovely rise; and DIl help you down and- up." 'I No. No, Margaret. I'm too weary to get down there. I'll stand till it's ov&amp;. The wet sand at this hour would give me cold for life."  I I Look at Mr. Frank, sir, helping splendidly with the rest. The stubborn sloop ought to slide off the sand-bar, for pure shame of her bad doing," continued the cheerful Margaret.  IICaptain Percy should - have anchored off the bar- ,there was the mistake," said the gen-  tleMnn, testily. "I hope we shan't be here long, Henry." "No, dear, I think not-that's a comfort." When the luggage came on shore, Margnaret drew a large trunk to the side of Mr. Warner. 'Now, sir, I'm going to build a sofa fit for a king or a, sick gentleman. This barrel means to -roll itself up for a sofa-back, and these wraps are upholstering themselves into a cushion. There, Mr. Warner, isn't that a jewel of an easy- chair altogether?" The invalid sank into the offered seat con- tentedly. "Yes. Yes, Margaret, it is very welcome. Thank you. There is always some way pro- vided when strength is just ready to fail. Prov- idence is always good." "Yes, sir--and will be while I'm on band!" laughed the quick-witted girl as she went off after another trunk, for the convenience of Mrs.. Warnelr. 'We shall have to wait here a while, matam. I'm certain they won't get her off, " she said in a whisper, its she returned. I "I am afraid they won't, Margaret;" accept. "ng the offered seat in a dainty, lady-like way, after first spreading over it her cambric hand. kerchief. "I might have helped shove, though!" whis- pered the girl conifidentially to the pebble whicl; she stooped to pick up for one of ihe children. But it don't signify." I  Whaht alre they doing now, Margaret V" ask. ed little Fannie, aged nine, coming up with face flowing, both hands full of treasures.

They tried going over the bar an Ilour too late; and as the water is now getting lower all the while, I doubt if even the small boats carl go all the way up the creek;. Yei hiere we are still, more than two miles from Mrs. Dlil "s cottage! Buat don't speaki of it to papa,Mhiss Anne. Trouble is a black cloud-- best let alone till it falls of itself; then some. times it settles the rough waterssmore than it stirs them up." "I won't speak of any thlingr vexatious ; but thatC black cloud will fall, whether the other does or not, " whispered Anne, pointing up at the threatening- sky. "Yes. I placed papa's back to that cloud, and inarnm's too. Kedp -,thein both looking over at the blue justyJonder' that'saadarling!" I II Mrgaret, what are they doing nowP" called Mrs. Warner. Rneefing the sails. Getting the bad thing trim. and tight, to leave her at anchor, I think, Mrsr. Warrner." All eyes wate-hed the movements on board the sloop; and when the men threw themselves into the boats, every one on shore breathed quickly with a sense of speedy relieE. A second boat had started up from somewhere, like a double of the other--evidently ready to help. 1 414 Btter than a second umbrella in a rarin- storm, that boat, to a party as large as ours, 7 clanttered Margaret to the children ; every body looking on delightedly. "But they aren't coming here! Don't you see, Malrgaret, they are going right away from us!"calledtlhe sickgeontleman, nervously. And, sure enough, the two boats sailed away over tile bar, carrying Mr. Frank, with the others. The stranded party seemed to be literally abandoned to their fate. "They must 'be coming round, sir, to take us from the opposite side, 19 cried Malrgaret, hope- fully. The party were on a narrow peninsula of sand, and the boats were soon seen nearing them, as Margaret had predicted. "Shall I run across, Mrs. Warner, and find ont whatt's to be done?" 'ADo, Margaret. Tell Mr. Frank to hasten here to hris father; and, Maggrie, hurry back,won't you?    Wea rreallsodistressed."  Thlepoorlady looked weary and anxl'ot&amp;-to  the-last degree.   "How can I ever walk over there, exhaust- ed, as I am? Dear! dear I what miscalcula. tion for us to undeertake all this for the sake of a quiet summer. Better have gone to a great L watering-place hotel, and lived in a crowd, than bear all this," grumbled -the husband. i  But we are really on shore, dear, and not ifar from our summer cottage. There's a quiet three months just ahead. It cau't be long no Before you can rest." Margaret ran with willing feet across the sands. One boat only came tomeet her. Frank splrang on shore. There seemed a moment's par-- lev. Then the two boats lleaded up the creek;; while Marilgaret was seen returning slowly, fol- lowed by the young gentleman, who stooped to gather pebbles, tossing up and catching them as lie walked. Whlat could it all mean? 'You tell thems, Margarect," said Frank. Get it well over before I come," 'Oh yes," she replied, cheerfully. "I've Igot the only olive-branch to be found 'in the sands, here, Mr. Frankr; but I would sooner run all the way to the new house on foot and get Ithe supper ready, than offer it to either of 'cm. They'll think I croak like a raven, and look blacker than the faithess bird who didn't come back at all from his erratnd." Well, grin from ear to ea--that's as Igood I a sunshine."I II So I must, then, and make believe black is white-if only they can be perujuaded, to think so."She hurried back, while the loiterer tossed his pebbles, and waited the result. "They're coming for its with a carriage, Mr. Warner--a comfortable, close carriage-to take the whole of us to our very door. There'll be no walking up now from the -water to the house, as there would have been if we bad gone up in the boats. We have only to wait a bit and make ourselves comfortarble."' II But why did they go off that way and aban-  don us?" , "Becatuse the boats will only go up half-way at low water.  To go in boats at all would give us a walk; but to go now would be out of the question. Tllat old captain has a good mile to trudge with his carpet-bag on his back, and b e'l I be wet to the ski n--that he, villal I  Margaret threw up a large umbrella as she spoke. "If you'll let me get the wraps, sir, I'll spread them against the storm. Captain Percy will soon come for us wi-th good horses, and they will take the bag-gage by itself" "Storm,1 rain coming, with all the rest!" cried the invalid aghast, and springiing to his feet, while Margaret hastily bundled every body    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5826-00000007"/> into water-proofs. Down came streams of wa- ter-cold, and driving in wild fury; and the thunder grumbled so 'impressively that every one else was silenced. Frank and Margaret plant- ed their feet firmly on the lower edge of an im-, mense blanket, and, holding the upper side high above their heads, they made an effectual screen for the whole party against the tempest. It was any thing but easy work, and the umbrellas were of no service to either of them. The others cowered down under them upon the trunks, though Anne stuck out her feet bravely to press down the blanket where it blew up under the fierce gale, and finally she too slipped out from under her umbrella, and stood up between Frank and Margaret-her father's umbrella continual- ly hitting her in the face as, it veered to and fro. Margaret had found time to pin up- her dress, rolling back the embroidered sleeves and fatsten- ing then at the shoulders; and the three, with their hats knocked over their eyes , stood upright in a, little semicircle, hardly able to keep them. selves from being tumbled over upon the sitting party below. 'The wind is still tempered to the shorn lamb, " plained the invalid, self-pityingly. "We're tempering it for all the slicep, father, old and young," retorted ]Fratnk. 'IIThere's one little ba in a fleece which must be both wind and water proof-eli, Fannie?" II I'm not a ba, I'm a bear; and I'd just as soon, tumble out into the storm as not, Mr. Frank WMarner." 'CGood for the bear!  Whenar this hurricaneo is over, he can come and give me a hug." I should- like to give up my place to that poor old Captain Giles," said Anne. "Oh dear! I shottldn't like to have him stand so close to me, then ; your feet stepping into my dress every half-minute, child, is as much as I can bear." 1- Do 1, mother--the wind pitches,, me so? But I won't again, if I can help it." "Captain Giles don't belong to the great un- washed, mother. He's been a kind of honor- able male sea-nymph from his youth up, and goes out swimming to this day. I say, it's a pity lie didn't cast in his lot here witlh us;i and I in- vited him." Of course you did, my son." Captain Percy said his carriage was elastic, and he could easily stretch it to hold us all ; but the old hero wouldn't 'wait. He said, IMiss Giles will be expecting me ; and I tell you, young man, if you can save your wife ten minutes of anxious waiting, it's better to walk than ride, and take your chance of a wetting, to do that."'"   "(A very proper sentiments" said Mr. War- ner, emphatically.   The walk will be hard for the poor -old captain, but,. happily, his strong back has been fitted for the burden."After- wards, when the storm waxed wilder, the' inva. lid's depressed spirits rose to a sudden exalta- tion. He forgot himself, and, standing erect, drinking in long breaths of the purified -air, he seemed to have grown strong atnd healthful within five minutes. 'IThis is really grand," he said, as the ocean and the thunder roared to- gether. It was hard to keep him from stepping out into the tempest, in his enthusiasm. "I like it too, papa; and it's a real ship. wreck, isn't it?"' "So it is almost, pussy, " he replied, laughing. Q uite, papa. There's the ship." T'lhere it is, sure enough, and better than wrecked ; and here are we, six souls, on a bare, sandy sore, in a hurricabec-as much cat off from all the rest of the world, apparently, as if we were in Juan Fernandez itself. It's quite an adventure,' Vannie."  The children had never seen hlim, in better spirits, and his wife's eye brightened. "Would the sea air work a, permanent cure?" So, talking, with abounding satisfaction, and battling successfully WIith the storm, which was finally conquered, the time wore away, and the carriage bove in sight just as a fine sunset came streaming over them. The sloop had been seen through the telescope, and her passengers ex- pected at their future residence. A cheerful fire was in progress, arid the fragrance of tea greeted their arrival. Then their landlady, whoo'wel. comed them to her well-spread table, vanished like the good' enii of the tales; and the new- comers remained masters of the situation. While the others were at supper, Alfred Brand drove up with the baggage. He and Margarect helped each other with mutual good. will, while II big box, little. box, band-box, and bundle" were all getting deposited in their va r rious niches up stairs and down. Thev talked together like old friends before the last trunk was in its final position, and shook hands at parting-an operation which left a, new tingle in the young sailor's fingers. But instead of shaking it off, 'le instinctively kept his hand clasped tight till he reached home- as if de- termined to keep fast hold of a very agreeable sensatiorl. That night Alfred Brand dreamed he had en- gaged to row a party of angels to a. wonderful island, where the grass and trees were rose- colored; but they got aground near by, while he tried in vain to shove them off. Presently   another oar was put into the sand beside his own. Two hands grasped it firmly; and as he looked, the armsn were: covered with embroidered green sleeves, and a smiling face, only a little pock-marked, with clear, shining eyes, looked, oat at him, saying, in a voiceless language, "I am going to help you!" - Straightway the boat floated again, and they found the island they sought. The angels landed; but as he rowed off, some one sat in his boat and worked one pair of oa6 ; yet he tried in vain to find out whether or not it was Margaret. A mist came   between them, and he could not see distinctly; but they rowed on au'd on together till the dreamm faded out, and he awoke in the sunshine. That night Malrgarett dreamed that they, were at sea in a great ship, which was suddenly wreaked upon a hidden rock, and in the midst of the frightful seene Alfred Brand stood high up in the rigging, saying to her in dumb show, "If I had been master of the ship, all this shouldn't have happened;" and MargaRret, be- lieving him, slipped somehow out of the ship into a great calm and slept peacefully till morning.   CHAPTER II. AN OLD DOVE-COTE.   II s breakfast most ready, Miss Giles?1" said Captain Giles, coming in from his early II chores," with his old hat held politely in his hand ; 11 be- cause if tain't I'll go out and hoe potatoes a spell." "Most ready, capting. I'm just turning the meat, and every thing else is about bakedd and biled. You had better lie down, after your cruise yesterday. It wouldn't pay to go into the garden now." Well, Iguess I will. This morning nearly I felt ever so little knocked up; but that all went off, after a whiff of the fresh salt air." A calico lounge stood invitingly on one side of the room, the nice chintz of the cushion pro- tected by a hlome-woven, parti-colored blanket, which looked both serviceable and comfortable, and the pillow was faultlessly white. Captain Giles, hanging his hat on a peg, laid himself- down, boots and all, with apparent good-will. On the other side of the room the table was laid with two covers side by side. All the- earthenware was of a flowing dark blue. The thin-bladed knives and two-tined steel forks were beautifully polished, and the spoons looked cer- tainly of the best and brightest silver; but such queer little slender things of a very notable pat. tern-possibly heir-looms in the family. The cloth was not white, but brown ; yet it had been smoothly ironed and folded, and was spotless, except for one little stain, which was carefully covered up a moment after by a blueplatte, filled with leaves of crisp, green lettuce. Then this little table looked as tidy and pretty as need be. Mn"rs. Giles peeped first into the oven, with a splinter from thd broom in her hand, one end. of which shethrust into something which was    baking. Then she drew back smiling, and said aloud to herself, IX needn't a-done that, it's only johnny-cake i Arming herself with a fork, she next peered into a covered pot, and gave three several stabs into the deptlis thereof. Then covering the -pot again with its shining lid, she lifted it deft- ly out of its place, shutting up the gap with the iron stove-lid, and poured off the water from the 'five potatoes which she had boiled to a turn, putting them back on the fire a moment without the cover, to evaporate the steam and make them II floury.", Then she brought out an oval, dark-blue dish, placed on it her three slices of thin ham., and poured over it the gravy thinned with water. She cut the johznny-cake into six small squares, bringing it, in its yelibPiwr  baking-plate, bodily to the table, and laid, her,"' five potatoes - all in their thin new jacketed which had broken open beautifully-intowa:disht which the maker had intended for a soup--prle.  Last of all, she added a minute pat of butter and  the tea-pot simultaneously. "Come, Catpting Giles, 1 said the smiling  little old woman, "I evry thing is on the table getting cold. Don't wait a minute, if you, ant a nice breakfast." "Done toaT, is it? Well,heave ho-1 My -back's a little stiff this morning, Miss Giles. That walk was pretty hard, after the day's work I'd had of it ; but I wasn't going to wait for the carriage, as if I wanted to seem city bred; and I got home an hour first--that's something." "You had: your supper, and fell asleep before they come past," said Mrs. Giles, sympathizing in her husband's feeling of triumph; "Lbut you must be quite ready for breakfast."    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5826-00000008"/> The captain was standing: half erect, with one band pressed halrd against his rheumatic back, and the other resting on his knee. His wife glanced over at him keenly. Her house- wifely heart- was with the breakfast which ought to be eaten without delay; but the wife- ly heart came instantl y uppermost. "Lt me got you some opodeldoc, John, and rub it in briskly with a woollen cloth!" "Psbaw, no I It's easy to got spleeny. I'll work it off. If I once get warmed with dig- ging, 'it will go." trMaybe it won't, capting." I'ltyi Not much danger of rheumatic in summer, if one is reasonable. It wasn't worth turning in at all, though, for such at can- dle-end of rest as you gave me, Miss Giles;i but I'm pretty hungry. That's a comfort!" The old couple drew up to the raised leaf of the table, which was still standing against the wall ; and when the captain bad asked the bless- iug, , the old wife began pouring the tea, to which she added milk plentifully, but no sugar; and the old husband helped himself to the salad, which he cut up and salted, adding a liberal supply of peppered vinegar. This done, they both came to a pause. "Which slice of ham would you like, Miss Giles?3" asked the captain, eying the plate care- fully in search of the best piece.   II Don't make a grain of differences,"' reaching out her plate. This one looks riaht, if it isn't itist a, little too lean." "I can make that up with gravy." "' So you can," said the delighted -old man, nodding his appiroval of her merry humor. Then they both sat and peeled their potatoes gravely. "They're nice, for new potatoes - don't you think so 3 "Don't know, Miss Giles. IC expect it's in the cooking." "They are not so very young, though ; tere are skins that would do for shoe-leather in case of necessity, capting." "(The old ones used to be as floury as meal, and these seem just like 'em. We shall have good potatoes pretty much the year round, if I: -keep the strength to hoe 'em, and you, do the cooking." "Thirs is light, I guess, for I put in an egg this morning," banding over her corn-bread., "It's real Indian sponge-cake," he said, in a tone of sincere belief, breaking off a crumb and eying it proudly. , After this,'not a word was spoken till breakfiist was nearly over. 3 For fiftyv-seven years this couple had broken bread to,,ether at the same table. For all these years the wife had been chief cook, whlile the   husband had kept a good appetite, good diges- tion, and a perpetually vigorous sense of grati- tudle. The table bad sometimes been drawn out from the wall, while sons. and daughters sat between them ; aind more frequently the mother bad eaten her meals with ctlildren ".on either side of her, while the husband was far -awayy over the waste of waters-generally in pursuit of the whale, but sometimes seeing a little of the-world and dealing in merchandise. All this had passed. The old couple had a cumulated a sufficient competence. The sons had inherited the calling of their father, and -the: daughtersr the vocation of their mother. TIwo children had gone before to lay the table 'for them in the unseen country, wlichl they were both ready to visit on the shortest notice. But they were still giving in a green old ag-e. CThat Mr. Warnncr, when he feels like it, is as merry as a sleighl-bell on smooth roads; but lie sinks down. all in a minute--like a baby thant's lost its mother, and nobody to comfort it. It's wonderful odd!"The old man's eye twink- 'led, as he straightened himself with an added dignity and vigor. "It ain't every one that can be as much a nian as ever at nearly eighty," answered the wife, proudly. 'Twice  a child, comes from sickness as well as age, I suppose. Poor gen- tlenian!" she added softly, ,and with true moth- erly pity. He talks like a parson sometimes, and I made him out to be one; but he says lie wal's in business, and gave it up only for sickness. Ricii enough, I guess, though, and lives now only to take care of his ailments. That don't pay; but then hie don't know it." Like old Capting John Wilson, he is always busy nursing his rheumatism. If yours got as much care, I expect it would be about the same thing. Howo is your back now?" "(All right; your third cup of tea just finished it. Old Capting: Jolln's wife has gone; I ex- pect it's that that has taken the marrow out of his bones, and I don't wonder." A tear started to the old wife's eye, and her shrivelled face flushed a little with at bloom fatirer than youth ever wore ; but she got up without speaking, and reaching down the large Bible fromr the shelf, wNith the spectacles which lay upon it, she handed both to Captain Gileis. They sat down side by side in two arm-chairs, while the' old man read a chapter. Then, with his Bible still on his knees, he bowredhis head. The wife folded her hands and bowed hers also, while theo husband prayed-using the same fine old Phrases whicU he had used for twenty-five or   thirty years, but with a, new warmth and ten- derness breathing through them, from the new stir of generous and grateful emotions. So they went about the day's duties--he to I his garden, and she to her unending little house. bold cares, which she allowed no one to share with her, and at which she wrought easily, with the perpetual feeling that she wrought only in love. Every few minutes she might have been seen with a plate or saucer in her hand, which sh'e polished till it shone, and flickered its blue radi- ance over upon the opposite wall, while she stood looking earnestly from the window. She was waiting to see if the old husband still showed any signs of the threatened rheumatism ; for her heart misgave her that he was making light of it, for her comfort. MCIore than a dozen times she still travelled to and fro between window and table, before she awas fillly satisfied ; then the shadow of care was thrown aside, and her face beamed plancidly. Captain Giles went on hoeing, and whistling as he hoed, with ae free and easy Motio4 which was unmistakable. IleI was a, tall, rather spare, sinewy man, with a stock; of gray hair, a gray beard, and a fornl upright enough yet to shame many a worktingmarn at-fifty. She was rather under medium size, and ever so little inclined to the dlumpling order of women; but her figure was still trim and neat, in its calico dress, check. cd apron, and white kerchief. Her bair was al. most as white as the muslin cap, with its Quank- cri.51 border, which layover it; and her check, if it was wrinkled, looked soft and kissable enough to any one who loved her-as an abun. dance of children and grandclildren did. Al- together, she was a gIrandmother who always will get more caresses and more genuine love than most grandmothers do; and she deserved it all. "Miss Giles," said the captain, coming in after an hour's work, II I guess I'll take about a, dozen fish-books in my pocket, and' go over and ask the Boston family to come flsbing with me on the pond. They've been up and down the beach ; but the poor gentleman has been sitting for half an hour in'thie shade of the louse, seem- ingly with nothling in the world to do. TYears to me, it would be -a mercy to get him engaged about something. How is he ever to get well if he don't!" "SUre enough, I don't see how he can," said the little woman, looking out into the distance so wistfully thlat she was evidently in search of a vocation for the sick gentleman. "But per- haps, he isn't strong enough for fishing." "Whew! it's Only a step I I'd carry him on    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5826-00000009"/> my back, if that wouolld do the business ; but I saw him walk five times as far up and down the shore, leaning on somebody's arm. Seems to me, he's got to learn to walk alone over again; and it's worth a trial." "So it is,") said the wife. Sharp glances went to 'and fro from the two pdirs, of old eyes; but neither of them would laugh. At last the woman took her husband's hand and said, coax- ingly, "Don't never say any thing of that kind to any one but me, John." "No,.Mary, I won't, if it chokes me; but we'll cure him up yet; only "--and the old captain fidgeted about uneasily-' I only I am just a little grain afraid of his wondterfttl digni- ty H"Zere both eyes twinkled like two rockets just before they shoot off in a white flame. "CThere, capting, there! Don't say any more; don't, as long as you live, or you'll forget and certainly say it to his -face-as you did to Polly White when she got a -sprained ankle." "Cured her in two davs!" said the chlptain, going off into a burst of iaughter. "This case is altogether more desperate; and if it's beyond my remedies,l shan't make an ass of myself, little woman." 'Well, rich Boston merchants anI. country girls can't be dealt with exactly alike," per- sistedt the dame, uneasily. "f course not; besides, this Boston mer- chant is, really an invalid-no doubt of that,   Miss Giles. I only think that, if he would makee me his doct6r, I could cure him in a month ; but I expect he won't do it. There, are you satis- fied that I am a very prudent man--as I ought to be at my time of life V" "I rather think you are;" her face relaxing into a smile slowly, but still with something of rather dubious pleading in it. "Don't trouble. I'maRctingupon honor withi you; find besides, yon wouldn't harve any fearr of me if you once saw how very gentlemanly lie is. Chances are, I shall give him a wide berth and go' off on another cruise, taking up the youngster, instead, as first mate." "That might do." (' So itmight. I neversbhall be anythlinghhut a great boy-loafer as long as I live; and my only regret is that I can't make you. go fishing too, with the best of the young follcs." I  IToo late -now to think of it, capting, " giv- Iing him a little push. "B besides, I'mri baking to-day ; and here are three loaves as haht as any sponge) IISo there are! Well, I'm off for worse Company, then ; remember that. I shall try my best to ge t the whole family in tow 'tip-top Irish girl and all. She'll be needed, as steam- tug for the rest." (rIf she isn't baking too." Well, yes, I s'pose there's housework; there -andc- waiting, to boot. We shall see how. they'll fix it."   CHAPTER III. RALLYING THE FORCjES.   CArTAfN GILES trudged over in his shirt- sleeves to the house of the new neighbors, fresh from the city; smiling a little to himself as be walked. If I take a righlt-ilanded hold of the sick man now, perhaps I can do him a Ireal service; but I rather guess it will be' I Love's labor iost.' Let it!"Thatt was thee current of his thoughts. Hatt in band, be stood as utpriglit as a senti- nel at the side of Mr. Warner's casy-ebair, run- nring his fingers just a little nervously through Iris gray hair, while he made his proposal defer. enltially. 'cI've a snug boat over here on the pond just by, Capting Warner--oars and sails, whicheverr you like--with plenty of fish-hooks, and bait. I have come over to ask the whole familov to go   fishing with me this morning, or this afternoon -just as, you may prefer." The gentleman opened wide his blue eyes, and gasped despairingly at the idea of his being in- vited to go fishing. "Tilank you, Captain Giles; but I Haven't done such a thing for seven years," he said, de- cisively. Apparently, thoronglily established as an in- valid gentleman, he looked with ineffable pity upon his thirty years' senior, who could be ple- beian enough to cultivate the health to endure such fatigue at his time of life. "I suppose it's a kind of second nature to you, a sailors" he said, soothingly ; 11 but I re- ally could- not think of going. I haven't the strength for such an effort. Thank You, though, captain."   &amp;,You are quite welcome. I'm a very old' salt, sir; but this pond is in the fresh-water line entirely." I ,Is it?" said RTt. Warner, innocently, his face beaming with affability.  "I suppose the water is smooth and safe. The children, I see, are eager to go. WS7e shall be glad to trust them to your care and experience, and I wish you success.") di Little fear on that head, sir. The fish are about as thick in the pond as girasshoppers are in a meadow. Here's a little lady, warranted to take af baker's dozen on her hook." "Oh dear! sha7t1 I, sir?" exclaimed Fannie, in excessive delight. IIThen I wish mamma. would go, or else Margarenrt." "All! that would do capitally." Malrgaret stood at the door, with a winning smile for the "'nice old captain " on her face; but with a wistful look; shinling in her eyes, which wassan unmistakablle endorsenient of F'an- niec's wislies. "If silo only could be atn indis- pecnsable comfortjust now to some one whowould join the fisbing-party!" -She was sure of re- maiiiing: an indispensable comfort somewhere; but that luxury was destined to be enjoyed ai present by the Ilome circle. Mrs. Warrner was too exhausted to think of flsbinm, and too de- l,=cndent on Margaret to dream of sparing her this mornincr, of all others; while they were sth occupied with the nerve-exciting task of un- packing and settling into new quarters. The operation of hanging dresses and dressing- gowns on rusty iron nails, against the white- waslied walls, had already set her teeth on edge to such a degree that Margaret had talien it wholly out of her hands without loss of time. Moving from an elegant city house into even a very neat and tidy country cottage, with its limited space and inevitable deficiencies, was a trial for which Mrs. Warner bad willingly and heroically prepared herself; yet it was some- thing to be felt rather severely by one of her somewhat over-fastidious tastes when it camel to the actuacl trial. Besides, she was bound to cover up all the annoyance from her sick bus- band' which made it only the worse both for her- self and Margarret ; and moreover, she was real- I Yhalf an invalid herself. This Margaret fully realize(], in her generous heart, so that she often served Mrs. Warner with a tenderness which was sometimes wanting even towards the sick gentleman. From early morning till now the willing girll liad been alert and active. There was a whole sea near by for a bath-tub; but in the absence of the reqaisite number of wash-hand bowls,   site had extemporized them from tin pans and yellow pie-dishes. Sailors' chests were con- jured into wash-stands, bedsteabds, or sofas, as the case demanded; and to -such an extent that their owner would -have looked on in surprise at the remarkable and unexpected qualities so sud- denly developed in her various p ossessions. Margarett proved herself as fertile in makeshiftf ingenuity its a) shipwrecked Yankee might, stranded on a wooded shore, with his jack- knife left, as his sole inheritance from a civil- ized past. Best of all, she kept Mrs. Warner from despair by a fund of good-humored moth- er-wit and suggestions which seemed perfectly inexhaustible.  She remained ant home cheer- fully, to go on manipulating the-family into an tinheardl-of state of cuslionedl comfort and even luxurv. Frank and the children were soon ready; but persistent old Captain Giles was still unwilling to give up iis morning dream of curing the inva. lid. HeI Clothed himself in some of the assured manner which he had been wont to 'nso towards his sea-sick passengers when be was in command of a lar c6 merchantman, and began alfrcssl. "My deanr Uvr. Warner, I should be only too glad to lend you an arm. It is but a short dis- tance. The little sail will 'be pleasant, and will certainly give you an appetite. We can retui-n in half an hour, if you desire. I have quite set my heart upon it, sir." Mr. Walrner looked incredulous; then fold- ed his hands and closed his eyes, leaning back. 'I haven't the strength for it, thank vou." "Ab9, well, I am sorry! You would find it an excellent constitutionall. Do you think you may be able to 'go in a few days, when' ou have rested from your journey? Our sea-air is a- wonderful invioorator ; and if you are not a well man by fall, I sliall be grievously disappointed." No. No, it is hardly probable I can go at all. I never expect to be well again in this life.' My highest hope is that I may be comfortable, and not too great a sufferer." I'Ah! I' hope you may realize more than that!" "We must submit to Providence," said the invalid, opening his eyes, and looking the fatint- est suggestion of reproof. 'Exactly, I suppose so; but I'm an old fellow nearly off dirty. I'm going in for an afternoon play-day, with all the youngsters' who choose to join me. I trust you'll enjoy a fresh perch with.. your dinner, sir, like the best of us; but if I cat three to your one, they'll all agree with me--if I've caught them first with my own hook." LfWill then, sir? Do you mean that, real.    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5826-00000010"/> ly?" asked little Fannie, coming up to his side and taking his brown-hand as they walked to- wtards the pond. "Yes, nly dear. I found out long ago that nothing ever disagrees with an-old sailor when  he's on duty. And since I have turned farmer, I find that almost any seed will do well if you only plant it in good soil." Captain Giles had fallen back into his com- fortable every-day manner, better suited to his jolly temper and his coatless condition. The children felt-perfectly at home in his company. "Don't you ever have to take after-dinner liills, then, like papa, Captain Giles?" asked Anne, looking up curiously at the smiling, bronzedl fatce. N o, child, never in all my life. Physic is just as unnecessary for my stomach, as red paint would be for my checks. I don 7t think it would make me any handsomer; do you?" "No, sir," said the child, simply, but turning away to hide her smiles under the shadow of her- great straw hat. His long deep wrinkles had possessed a curious fascination for her from the first. T'ley seemed to be so twisted and crossed, and mixed up in a general complica- tion with smiles and good-hurnor, that she had watched hinr all the day before with incessant wonder. Now, to think of putting rouge, over all this, was almost too much for her gravity. IL look plenty well enough for the old wife I've got at home. Don't you think so?" "I like you," answered the child, laughing; and coming tip to him. frankly, she took llold of his other hand. A light came into, the old captain's eyes, "Well," said lie, 11 we sliall be friends, I: see; and my wife is as much better than I am as the blue-fish we'shall get next week are better than the perch we alre going after to-day. Besides, she makes capital doughnuts find gingerbread for little folks. These may not be very healthy for the small city people who are sitting all day in school, but they are capital for little fisher- women here on the island. I've no doubt Miss Giles would be glad to exchange a cake for a smile or a pretty word, atly day. She has little granddaughters just your age, and you'll put her in mind of 'em." II Do they live here, too, Captain Giles 3 "No, none of 'cm here. All on the main land; but they come to see us sometimes. Now, young casting, can you row?" he asked, turn- ing suddenly to Frank. IIJust a little, sir ; I'm not very skillful, but I can learln."   Good! It will blister your hands, though." We Cll, let it." Sb Small you wear gloves?" "I? Nol!"saidthheyoung gentleman,aalit- tle contemptuously ; "I've come to get brown." So they stepped into the boat, all in holiday mood, and rode awary, all four, into fairy- land. But the perch bite in the enchantedl realms quite as readily as they do in the most prosaic -waters; and the party, after two houirs,-came home plentifully laden with fish and unboundetl satisfaction. Fannie's baker's dozen, plustwo, had been fairly caught; and were found delight- ful eating by the still enchanted fisbing-party,' though no one found any ill effects following from sea-air appetites and an ample supply. II That Captain Giles is a brick, mother!" said Frank. II When I'm an old man, I'll re- tire to a safe pond somewhere and set up a boat. It's immensely better than only suckingL onp' s thumbs and growling fialf the timc, like a win- ter bear." II Remember though, my son, that a gentle- man is more than a fisherman." "Yes , mother, but a fisherman 7nay be a gentleman-at least I know of one who is. Ile's the very best old sole-leather I've met in a life- time. H-e suits Fannie and me just equally; and as for little Miss Sobersides, she looks upon Iiini alicady as a wonderful and many-voiced oracle." "All1 the virtues combined, and delightfully flavored with perch!" answered the mother, laughing.              I "I suspect so, a little," said Frank, modest,. ly, trying to moderate his very sanguine belief in his new friends ; II but at any rate lie's a wVon- derful prize as a summer guide and rural tutor; you'll admit so much, mother?" "I am inclined to think he is, Frank. His experience and discretion will be of great value, and I shall feel all the easier if you are in his compaLny." "SO then, he is to- be cultivated without stint. Looray! he's worth a dozen youngsters!" As for Margaret, she took; the fish vigorously in band; looking every one in thee mouth curi- ously, as its turn came, and pretending to the children that she had a dim idea that it might possibly contain a golden coin-a marvel which tradition had whispered to her did once occur in the olden times. So they all ate their fish for two meals in tthankfulness, and the evening and the morning were the first day.   CHAPTER IV. ON THE RILL-TOPS.   "WHVAT party is that, Frank, over on tile hill Vonder?" asked his father. "'I have seen themn thelre everyy night since we came ; and i we form as pictulresq1ue a group as they do, we alre almost as pretty a sight as the fine old sea itself." i(Evidently they think we do, father; for they seem to-look often enougll this wazy. It's the Ma'Iybonglis, parents and children, gone up there to see a little of the world after iunset ; andc a neighbor or two have conic to gossip in eompa8ny.") "These people reallyv take a good deal of comfortt" said the invalid gent-leman, medita- tively. LLThey sell us their eggs, cream, and green peas, aend live themselves contentedly on  fish, potatoes, and hard work; but they all seeni  to enjoy it. "That little Molly came tugging: her basket  of new potatoes, bigger than herself, lip the hill to-daS, her bare legs scratched woefully with theI briers--but persistingf that her load wasn't very ( IteavS, and she didn't want any extra pennies for bringing it up. She was just a convenient little tame donkey, I thought; but if that is she dancing  on the top of the stone fence, she is  frisking now like a pet lamb.  Hecr voice floats over here as charming as a birdl's, without a note  of care in it.' It's really wonderful!"  "The tfonkeys, you know, sir, cat thistles, and i thrive on them beautifully-," said Margaret, who 1 came up just in time to hear the last few sen-  tences; bringing a warm cloak, which she pro-y ceeded to wrap about the invalid. "So they do, Margaret.  There are blood- i horses who must have oats, or die ; and don- r, keys, who will do well enough if they can only s, get thistles."                n "Blood-horses might not win  in steeple- ti chases, father, without oats ; but I expect they NN would survive if the' got only hav; and very b likely would roll over famously in the Pasture v, if they once got out of the stable."   The gentleman shook his head positively, without dleigninig a reply ; but lie drew his cloak about him, and sat tip with a conscious and ma- jestic presence which was almost overwhelming. Frank only lifted his eyebrows; but Margaret turned away with a little gesture of impatience, which she meant no'ono to see, and usedl only as an outlet to her own feelings. Then she went vigorously to work h Ielpingi Mrs. Warner, whio had just come up on to the hill with the children, in finding a more comfortableposition for her rocking-chair. So the family were all assembled here in their out-doors evening dcraw- ing-room. Mr. WarnLer sat in his large-armed, stuffedi cilair; Mrs. Warner in the little rocker, that never could find a perfectly satisfactory place for its large and restless feet; Frank occupied a campl-stool, and the children and Margaret, either a long, hard bencli, or the more coinforta. ble glass at their feet, as they chose. The un- compromisifing woodecn  bench was a fixture ofC the placec for the season ; bolt the easy cushioned chairs, went up and down the hill daily, and sometimes even three times a day, in Matrgaret's arms. The camp-stool, whichl folded and un- folded just about as easily as a pocket-liandker- chief does, and was abont as useful to its owner; was the personal property of Mr. Frank, going with him wherever he saw fit to carry it. This hill-top overlooked the sea; indeed it was al- most on the edge of the overhanging cliff, and yet was but a little way from the cottage. One markied feature of this neighborhood was its apparently interminable number of distinctly. rounded, smooth bills, varying in size and shape; some of them clustered in bunches, and others more remote, with valleys and-lesser swells be- tween. They were aLlmost -alwatys covered with grass, either closely mown, or eaten off by the sheep; while along the sides or in the valleys 7iestled the cream-colored, lime-washed; weather-wornl houses, mottled with their brown    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5826-00000011"/> patches where the wash had peeled off--in the' distance harmonized in a pretty neutral tint suggestive of stone. The gardens and culti- vated fields clustered also in the sheltered nooks, and the scant shrubbery, which ventured to lift up its head some distance from the shore, stood grouped about the dwellings; mutually giving and receiving protection against their blustering foes, the sea-breezes. Yet this land- scape, even if judged solely on its own merits' independent of the ever-restless ocean upon its borders, was most cliarmingrat tilis hour, when the lingering rays of sunset covered it with regal glory latndward, and the young crescent moon hung over the sea. Even in the broad glare of sunshine the sky outline of those treeless, brownie ish-green hills was always beautiful; while if you could peep over them or between the most distant, you, almost always caught the glaring of blue water-in one direction generally stud- ded thickly with sails; and in others, quiet bays or inland ponds sleeping peacefully in the valleys, or lying at the feet of green, uprising hills. Here was a scene far enough away from the great busy world and its calre; yet it was a little world in itself, teeming with its own little restless, earnest, pungentlyv-flavored life. The Mayboughl party, perched on their hill- top, perhaps an eighth of a mile inland, occupiedl a broad stone fence which began in the valley, running directly over the summit. Another stone wall, starting from this at the apex, ran off at right angle s in one direction, making a delightful terrace, on which the little ones Scampered to and fro in their play. Four small moving figures stood out distinctly against the rosy western sky, and, in the distance, ev- ery movement of these barefooted countlry chil- dren seemed full of grace ; while the elders, sit- ting quietly on the fence in various attitudes, made a very striking and picturesque group. "It is really a charming tableaus" said Mrs. Warner, her placid face lighting up as she looked. "Rural felicity exemplified," laughed Frank, "'made rose-colored in one instance at least," pointing to the now partially-faded sunset. "7is- distance lends enchantnient to the view) " added his ihnther, rather pompously, but good-naturedly.. "And yet, I'll wager that the actors in the- scene flnd it entertaining, father. You see, they repeat it every evening, and apparently find their hour of chit-chat more comforting than an evening cordial." "It is a very pretty custom indeed for a few neighbors to gather in that way into a social,   knot in the twilight; but I confess I am very glad their hill is not any nearer to ours, said 1Mrs. Warner, with a little complacent lifting of the evebrows., "Why, motherP" asked Fannie, with wiide- open eyes, looking longingly over at the play- ing children. The lady only laughed, And said, II Make  Frank give you a game of romps, pussy." "Will you, Frank?" Yes;i and if you catch me, I'll answer yovir question to mother." The young gentleman was caught after a time 7 stopping to take breath very near his mother's chair. "Now, FrIank, why doesn't mother wish the Mayboughs to come ainy nearer to us?" de- maanded the child. "Because their blood is just as much thicker than ours as the soles of ttleir feet are, M/iss Pussy," replied hier brother, with the utmost gravity. "Is it, mother 3 "Now, Frank!" remonstrated the ladv 7 with a Father pleased smile; and Fannie discoveringr  that she had been soldE, as hel brother would have expressed it, scampered away, scrambling down over the sandy cliff, to join Anrne and Margaret, who bad gone to enjoy the sea-sholre by moonlight. Frank followed her ]Ialf down the slope, where, digging his licels into the sand to secure a firmer footliold, he stood tossing peb- bles out into the ocean until the party came within hailing distance. Upon the cliff near the sliore, some furlongs off, was a solitary gray rock; and lying upon this, in the shadow, was a motionless' figure in a red shirt, which gleamed out in the soft moonlight, thougll the face of the wearer wats not visible. "'Margaret! MCargaret!"  called Frank, in a tragic tone, II who is tilat sitting upon the great rock yonder? He bhas becen perched there like a black crow for the last hour; but seems to me lie bas red on his wings." "Whist!  whist! Mlr. Frank,, called back Margaret, reproachfully. "You are out-roar- ing the ocean. It would be better to go and ask him. It's some fisherman, likely." "Looks more like a sailor," laughed Frank. iI wish I only bad my spy-glass. Do you wish for my spy-glass, Margaret?" "HUS111 ]ad! I say, bush! can't yotl? You needn't 'call the stars down to look, since it's no concern of theirs I Seems to me, be isn't seek- ing the notice of any one, whoever he' is." "O11 only noticing, likely ;" and the great merry boy', not quite out. of his teens, went   laughing back to his mother. He had, recog- nized Alfred Brand, and divined, as Marearct herself did, that he had perched himself upon ttre rock this evening, as he had been observed by them both to do several times before, sim-   ply to overlook Margaret, in whom lie evidently f Nt a rapidly-growing interest. Frank was far from, giving a hint of this discovery to either of his discreet relatives, as he throw himself upon tlic grass at his mother's feet.   CHAPTER V. M A R G A R E T.   MARGARaET hlad lived in the Walrner family for more thatn eight years. She was but little more than. a child when she first came to them; yet the sharp discipline of life had already giv- cii ler a developed womanly nature--forbear- "19, sympathetic, and fertile in resources-- though at that time she stumbled over long words, and could only read in the simplest book with great labor aind difficulty. She had passed withtthem thijough prolonged and heavy trials, and had born6' tlrcir burdens with a patience and heroism, which few of the world's heroes may ever hope to equal. F1ank Warner could never forget the comfort wlrichl she had brought to bini on the day when his little sister died--the only one near tlis age, and his early playmate. Her care had seemed -is timely as a drought of water to one dying of thirst. Ilec lay sobbing upon the floor, a forgotten Inorsel of desolate, broken-hearted hunifinity ; washing and half believing lie -was going to die, too. Marg'aret lifted his aching head from the  floor. Site soothed him, and croned over him ; till it seemed to him that by some gentle, holy incantation she had literally drawn out a chok- inmr heavy -%eight from. his throat and lungs w wlich was stifling bim. The touch of her hand, 'is it lay over Iiis forehead and drove awciy the great throbs of cruel pain, had left in Iiis mem- oryr a gratitude which could never die. It had invested her--a simple nurse-giirl for the little ones--with a lialf-motherly, half-an-  Oelic dignity, which all these years had not ef-  faced. That,7 first and greatest girief stood apart,I in its bitterness and in its healing, from everyI other event in his life.  He remembered, as in a dream, how, as he  lay upon the carpet while Margaret sang in-lowI tones, all the pain graduallly receded, and he i himselff seemed floating into Elysium.     I Whenm he awoke next morning, be was lying I s in it mass of dainty pillows, the-flated white ruf-; I   y' fles contrasting pleasantly with the bright flow- e ers of the carpet; and ;be well-known cradle- ;spread, which was 'thrown lightly over hini, made him feel for. a moment that he was once more a little child. E%,cry pulse bounded with a new and delicious happiness, and it seemed to him that it would be delightful to lie just there forever. The windows were all heavily shaded, the dim light prolonging the waking 1reeric which he had no wish to break. It was only when his eye wandered to the clock on the' marble mantel, which slowly pointed out to him 4 ten minutes to twelve," that lie understood it was already noon, and remembered what had Happened. I  But the truth seemed to him now almost as Though it must be a fiction; and ttlough lie condemned himself that it was so, and tried to realizec his sister's loss as he had done at first, yet the sense of it never returned to him a ain as a present, terrible reality. Even when lie took the last look of the dear little face, though something cut through his heart like a knife) it seemed too sharp a pain to last long. He began thinking how very beautiful she was now, with that still, white, marble sweetness which be had never seen be. -fore; and that memory clung to him always, afterwards. In those dark days, all the family had hung upon Margarect with almost filial dependence. The mother--sick, and worn with the care of her child-drooped helplessly when it was taken from her; and the two little girls fell into Mar- garet's almost exclusive care. Only a month had passed since little Alice 'died, when Mr. Warner's long illness began. ,-At first there was prolonged and excruciating suffering, from the effect of which his constitution had never recovered. The disease was apparently re- moved, yet he had never rallied into his old self again, but bad settled into a chronic inva- lid. TIhus tirere were months together when    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5826-00000012"/> the whole family seemed to belong to the nurs-l cry; and the young Irish girl, Ilardly seventeen when she came to them, really felt herself al- most a mother to them all. Hers was a broad unselfish nature in the be- ginning, and life's discipline had only increased its wealth in that direction., She was fromthe north of Ireland, with a Scotch ancestry. Her father had brought her, his youngest and only surviving child, to this country when she was ten years of age. EHer whole ninth year had been employed as nurse to her sick, gentle' mother; who had pined like a fadfingr flower 1 from grief for her five lost children, and still more from want and over-work. The husband had wroughlt faithfully; but there had been famine in the land. Both par- ents and all the people about them grew hollow- eyed; but Margaret bad never sufi'rcd with hunger. This last child was fd even while the parents both fasted. Margaret didn't know this at the time : but when site came to lealrn of it afterwards, it filled her whole healrt with a won- derful, tenderness which yearned to repay tis debt of gratitude somewhere. When plenty came again, her mother still drooped; aind when she left them, they came over to this country to forget their sorrows. For two years Margaret was kept in, school, and then her father went suddenly to rejoin bier mother; and she was an orphan in the Now World, with only willing hands for her patri- mony. She llad fared much as others like her fare, who are honest and willing to wor 'k; had gone from pillar lto post, picking up a good (real of general training in many directions, and learn. ing a wonderful and steady self-reliance for one so young. So she had drifted into the Warner port, 'where her wide experience already made her feel that, in spite of its drawhacks, it was safest to remain. Other servtants came and went; but her heart had entered into their trials, and she served them ath willingly. Very soon she came to know their limitations, yet she readily for- gave them. In return, she was abundantly appreciated; and had long: since become a treasure to them, that they were prepared to hold with a mi- serly and unscrupulous tenacity which- her. own disinterestedness could never- have j tstified. In their darkest hours she bad been to all the household like a raly of incarnated sunshine. There was always a little cheerful breeze stir- ring if she entered the sick-charnbef, for her nature was as Subject to rippjles and dimples as the chubby checks of a rolylpoly child. There   was too much of it to lie evenly in a smooth level; ol perhapsthe whole was made light and bubbly with the old leaven of Irish vivacity So, without being either a wit or a genius, she was an everydayt3 household comfort. Frank taught her to write; she had already made pot-hooks in sebool, for some months ill her childhood; Mrs. Warner lent her books and encouraged her to fead with the children ; and, with leisure and a good library at her com- mand, she had become in these eight years a cultivated and well-infornled  young wroman. She often took turns with Frantfk as reader to tile familly in general, and to Rar. Warner in particular. Yet Margaret remained a servant ; very rare- ly taking ier meals with the family, and Iper- forming some of the most menial duties. They needed io' have such things done for them. She was well paid, loaded with presents, annd nev- er over-workecd. The presence of other servants was often dlisnfgreeable, -and became evervp year more and more intolerable. She wps never in the way; and even Mr. Warner himself would have nursed her like a brother, without feelin" Ihiniself derneaned by it, if she bad been sick. But Margaret never was sick. She was a robust, sensible woman of twenty-four, whole- hearted and courageous. Her nearly sorrows seemed to have drifted very far past; and if her life-voyage was sometimes sqlually and threat- ening, there was sunsliine enough in herself to enable her to bear it, and to look uniler a IOng series of arched rainbows into the future. She understood her social status in the fiam- ily, and appreciated it; but she was a woman ; 'and at twenty-four every woman begins to- think rather seriously of the future, and to findc something stirring within hrwihi  o Wholly satisflcd by the kind of care and affec- tion with which Margaret found herself sur- rounded, nor yet 'with that which she herself was able to lavish so generously upon her vari- Otis prots.5gc's. The web of social relations had grown up about her naturally. It seemed silken -and brifht-colored in texture; yet she often felt that she was entangled in it almost inextrica- bly, and she began to feel a little as if it was nearly impossible that she should ever tear it open and get free. Naturally she rebelled against this, and often snapped a thread here and there, eittler in vexation, or in pure self- assertion. There had been those-outside who, would willingly have helped her, but they had Inot succeeded. So the pockmnarked servant- girl, who hadd read fairy tales in azbundance, in   her secret heart compared Herself to an enchaznt. ed princess locked up in a castle, and wonder- ing if the right-prince would ever come and un- lock the door. But the wardens promptly warned off every one who made the attempt. Mauny a young me- chlanic bad made advances in the right direc- tion; but the ruling powers had alwaysg man. aged somehow to keep them at a distance. Handsome young workmenm in shining caps had been allured froin the premises, or smuggled quietly through on false pretenses. At first this amused Mazrgaret, giving her not, only an added sense of her own value, but also an ;Ilmost grateful feeling towards those who so obviously prized both her presence and 2ler serv- ices. At that time she was under twenty, and the changes in her short, friendless life bad al- readyq bee far too manv. Afterwards it was diftr!ent. IAt twenty-three, a handsome young carpen- ter met her often, here and Ithere, in sundry places where he was least expected, always with smile and a few very commonplace, yet, -to lier, exceedingly charming words--till she was becginningif to think somcttiingf was drawing him to lier, as feathecrs are attracted to amber, and to Nvish heartily that he was not altogether so "ight-weightedd a person as lie-seemed in her estimaition - when he suddenly disappeared. Sonic time affdcr she learned that he hlad secured an-excellent business-opening in New York, but Slic never sawy or heard from him. afterwards. Shle certainly was somewhat surprised at this, and always a little less forbearing and mrore watchfuilly suspicious of those about her, but was in no sense heart-broken. - Fi:ank knew what Margaret only surmised-- tlhat BIr. Warner had procured the young car- pecnter's transfer and promotion; but even be did not dream till afterwards to what unjustifi. able, length his father's interference bad extend- ed. He thought lie observed that Margaret   was both a little surprised and vexed at her ard- mirer's taking French leave, and his sense of justice made him wish that matters could at least be left to take their own course ; yet he honestly believed that none of ttlose who had seemed available were half good enough for Margaret. Some ilonths later lie discovered that the young carpenter had left a letter addressed to Margaret, which, falling into his father's hands, had somehow failed of ever being delivered. At this he was exceedingly indigFnant; but lie had never ventured to speak on the subject even with his mother. His father was hardly the person whom lie would presume either to repri- mand8, or to call on for an explanation in a mat- ter of this kind. But since then, Frarnk, like IMargret, had been more OPOTI-eyed and on the alert-like parties always on the defensive, -and a little prone to look out for aggrerssions. When, therefore, he had detected twro Dr three glances of admiration bestowed Upon the help- ful Irish girl, soon after they had taken posses- sion of the little sloop Constance, and had noted that Alfred looked and listened with evident interest whenever MaIalgaret talked with the children, or in various ways proved Ilerself to be a general family treasure, as well as a kind- hcaartcd, intelligent woman, Frank immediately thereafter fell into a long chat witl- the bright- lookin-, red-haired sailor; and finding himn to be a sensible, self-respecting man, who had sail ed half over the world with his eyes open, lie affier- wards quietly amused himself by casually draw- ing out Margaret's best qualities and covertly watching the effect upon the appreciaative Al- fred. Fraznk bad no special intention of playing tile rolo of match-maker; but here wans a bit of by- play which amused him during a long after- noon's sail. His boy's heart delighted in it; but his smoo-th boyish face -looked preternaturally glrave and innocent.    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5826-00000013"/> CHAPTER VI. SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS.   IN the afternoon of the day following their arrival on the island, Frank, who lay sprawling upon the grass under the window, looking idly off at the tossing blue waters, suddenly started as Margaret ceased her monotonous little song, and the heavy bass of Alfred Brand followed in its stead. "Good-day, Miss Margaret. This basket was left behind in the sloop, and I have brought it to you." "Ah," said Margaret, "it is little Miss Fan- nic's. She'll be glad to get it, and thank you for the trouble of bringing it over." "It's not far, and it was no trouble. I live at my cousin's-the house just back there over the hill. You can see the chimneys and the roof. So we shall be neighbors for the pres- ent." "But you will be off on the sloop most of the time, I suppose?" "Oil no. We sail only occasionally, as we find cargo. The rest of the time I am farmer. I have been working all day in the corn-field over yonder." "Won't you sit down, then, Mr. Alfred- neighbor. You see I don't know any other name yet," laughed Margaret, saucily. "You helped me so nicely with the trunks when you brought them last evening, that of course I feel half acquainted." "Of course," said Alfred, smiling, blushing, fidgeting, and trying hopelessly to find some- thing to say. "Thebf here is a chair, neighbor," said the self-possessed Margaret, smilingly bland and amused in the face, but a little softened at the heart. "Thank you, no, not this time. I meant to say that I hope we shall become well acquaint- ed before the summer is over; though I don't know your whole name either, yet, Miss Mar- garet. But will you offer me a seat the next tihe, if I come again?"   "Not unless I find that you bear a good name!" laughing. "Very well," retorted the youth, recovering himself, and giving back a look as smiling and straightforward as he had received; "you must find out about that from some one else, then; but I am afraid you won't take the trouble to inquire. It was certainly a shabby thing to leave you all on a sand-bar for two hours in the rain; but I did my best." "That you did, and got much the worst of it yourself," said the girl, warmly. "Good-bye, then, Margaret, till we meet again; and don't lay up the bad luck against me." At the door he stopped, hesitated a moment, and then picked up a handkerchief which was lying on the wood-box in the outer porch. "I know your name now-Margaret Nelson ;" hold- ing up the marked handkerchief. "Mine is only Alfred Brand." "Ah! well; it seems a very good brand, short and handy -if only you bear it honor. ably, as I believe you do." "I certainly do, so far as I have learned how." Then, carried away by something which he read in Margaret's face, or by something which came surging up from his own heart, he could never tell which, he said hurriedly, while his face grew redder than his own red hair, "My present belief is, that if you will ever give me the opportunity, after we know each other well enough, that it is a name which I shall offer you the chance to take for yourself. Will yo(a promise to think about it, Margaret?" "H don't know yet," stammered the girl. "Don't forget that we are really strangers," she said quietly, after a moment. "An ac- quaintance for a lifetime is not wisely made in a day." "I know it, and I have not acted prudently; but I have acted as I felt. Goodbyee"He dashed out of the house, carrying away the   handkerchief, bounding along, strong and sup- ple in every limb, and was soon busy again in the corn-field. Frank, still sprawling in the sunshine like a sleepy lizard, pondered .N  the look which came into the eyes of this sailor-farmer, who passed without seeing him. He peeped slyly up also at Margaret, who stood looking out at the window with a far-off thoughtfulness in her eyes. Then Frank rose up like a man, walking directly over to Captain Giles, whom he found leaning on his hoe in his potato-patch, await- ing him with a pleasure expressed on his dry old face which made the boy at once proud and happy. "Captain Giles, tell me about some of the people who live around here. You see, I want to know something of my neighbors." "Well, come into the house, and I'll intro- duce you to Miss Giles. Shes the very best per- son I know about here," said the cheery old man. "I don't doubt it, if she's akin to you, cap- tain." "Oh I she's no relation o' mine-not a grain. I never heard of her in my life till I was your age." Frank laughed cheerily at the joke; but his real entertainment arose from the delightful appreciative flash of sunshine in the old cap- tain's eyes.   ,Declining to go in, he began pointing out all th houses within sight, and asking after their respective owners. 'That large white house there, half in sight, with he whale-ship and the whale for a weath- er-cock, that's Capting Hezekiah Percy's-our Capting Ephraim's brother, you know. We are almost all kinfolks! You see, the whole stock of the island-this end of it especially-is link- ed in and out like one of those brain-corals we were talking about. Capting Hezekiah's place is varnished up with sperm oil; and it's about as trim and tight as any thing to be found here- abouts. He cast anchor under fifty-got tired cruising, I suppose." "Rich, probably!" suggested Frank. "Gold enough for ballast," laughed the cap- tain. "Mebbe he got pretty nigh frozen up often among the Northern icebergs; the chill, I think, struck a little into his heart. Some of us here fancy he might have swallowed an icicle, and it petrified afterwards-he's so very upright. You ought to know him, though; and your fa- ther will think him worth twenty old boys like me, who can't help frolicking at a hundred, if we try." "Ah!" said Frank, with an awkward boyish- ness which showed that he was not quite at ease yet. "You see, sir, sperm-oil ought naturally to    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5826-00000014"/> keep it light and warm all round, if it's only kept burning. But don't think I am hard on Capting Hezekiah though; he's an own cousin o' mine; but I got a start from the kitchen-side of the house, and he from the parlor, I expect. He used to ride on my shoulders like a young nabob, when he was six, and I six-and-twenty or thereabouts. It's nature on both sides, you know. He keeps up the dignity of the hills here, and I keep up its fun, so as to bring it to an average." "I see!"Frank had found his reckoning at last, and began to enjoy it. "You went to the South Seas generally, Captain Giles; so you al- ways got entirely thawed out coming back along the equator." "( Exactly!" "Who lives there under the hill? The house looks as though it was trying to burrow in the earth, to get out of the way of the winter blasts." "Likely that's the very feeling which went in with every nail from the foundation to the roof. It's a house with a history, too, but I won't stop to tell that. They are poor folks, but honest. That's Capting Salathiel May- bough's." "Oh yes; they made our garden for us. These hills, misled me so much, I had lost the direction." "Capting Salathiel is a cripple, you know, and was down on his back last year for months. Mrs. Salathel ought to have been a capting herself, if ever a woman should; for she could steer around the world on a short cut as well as any one I know. Last summer, whew she had a bad felon, their little Molly was thcelifc-boat that-kept the whole family afloat. Hard times they've seen altogether. I am glad your folks have taken 'em in tow. Couldn't do a better thing for them, or yourselves either." "If they have every thing as refreshing as their green peas were for dinner to-day, I shall be a powerful steam-tug in myself; you may be sure of that. It is to be hoped their garden is well supplied?" "So it is. It's a little place, but they keep their land fat all the time. They're so near the shore, you see, they can feed it with sea-weed without stint. The Sahara Desert would raise good crops, only gorge it with sea-weed, and water it now and then. Do you see how black the sandy soil has got to be in all our gardens?" kicking at the dark mould under his feet. "So that's sea-weed, is it? I wish, then, you would plant trees, and feed them as you do your corn and potatoes, Captain Giles."   "I've half resolved to do it again and again; but it wants a great regiment of 'em, each to keep its neighbors in countenance. A single tree won't grow well; but I remember woods about here with all sorts of trees bigger around than my body-some four times as large; and when I was a boy I got lost in a forest, just over there, and wandered about half a day with my finger in one eye, and the other keen for an opening almost anywhere into daylight. Times change, you see; but this ocean-side is hard on any thing that lifts its head up-that's a fact. They have trees yet in some parts of the island-oaks generally, with low tops and wide branches-but pines do well, and other sorts. Over at Wauchatti there are trees still, two or three feet round." "Bless me! I'll drive there to-morrow. My eyes are sore already from looking so hard to find a tree anywhere; but these sand-knolls, with the sheep-grass on them, make a sky-out- line even prettier than trees. So I'm satisfied." "Yes, I should think so. Fish and flesh are almost too much for one meal, if you want a good digestion." "Whose large field of corn and potatoes is that yonder? It's well cared for." "You may say that, you may! If he keeps on, he'll be the best farmer in all the region, and lie's half sailor, too; but, for all he's am- phibious, he's thoroughgoing in both elements. That's Alfred Brand's farm-you remember him; lie sails the sloop with Capting Percy. If he was capting and the other fnate, it would be none the worse; though one of 'em is my cousin, and the other isn't." "Where's his house? Is he married?" "Don't you know he isn't?" said the old man, with a keen look into Frank's face. The young man received this arrow of questioning with an expression as innocent and woolly as a lamb's. To be sure, he had come here on purpose to learn about Alfred; and nobody else especially interested him at present; but he was not in- clined to confess as much, and the shrewd old sailor was really thrown off the track. He had noted a little of the by-play of the various parties on the Constance, and thought he had some in- sight into the state of the case; but now he became doubtful about it. "I thought there was always a free-masonry about unmarried men which revealed their standing to each other," he continued. "Young men have a way of casting eyes which don't be- long to married folks, who have picked out a wife already. But Alfred's a steady boy; and though he must be about five-and-twenty, he   has never taken specially to any girl, as far as I have heard. I've thought, for a fewmonths back, that he was looking about some, but I dunno." "Red-haired and fiery!" suggested Frank. "Quick to feel, I've no doubt, but I've nev- er seen him unreasonable in little things or in great; and he went his first voyage with me. I had him on board five years, off and on. lie hated liquors and liked books, and he nev- er was afraid of work. That's enough to say of any man, red-haired or not." "He's a happy fellow, captain, in having you for a champion. Where are his folks?" "Ncver linhad any from a baby-nothing but an uncle, who took pay for bringing him up till he was ten years old, and so sucked out the very small nest-egg his parents left for him, leaving nothing but the shell. After lie start- ed for himself, he always hung on to a cousin who lives over there-you can just see the chim. neys. There's where he boards now." "Has he much land?" "Nearly fifty acres here, and meadow over on the flats. I dunno where he'll put his house. I s'pose he will build some day-and marry, likely. Not many women on the island would have a call to give him the mitten-so Miss Giles and I think, both of us: and if he would take a fancy to either of my dozen grand- daughters, all city bred, I should not object; but they might, maybe. Girls brought up on pavements can't like any thing, generally, which touches either land or sea. There must always be smooth roads outside and magic carpets in- side the house for their sweethearts to walk on. I was born on this island, and'I am going to be buried here; but I expect not many of my pos- terity will be content to lay beside me on these bleak old shores." The old man's thoughts had wandered away somewhere:; but though Frank had learned all lie came to ask, he didn't choose to leave ab- ruptly. Perhaps, too, he was desirous to recall the kind old captain from the one vexation of his life-the want of adhesive love which his otherwise dutiful children all felt for this be- loved bit of fatherland, to which he himself clung so tenaciously. Other men's children settled about tlecm; his had all gone I   "There's one house more in sight," inter- rupted Frank, breaking in upon the reverie from which the old captain awoke with a start. "Give me a bit of gossip on the people over yonder, and I have done questioning." "Over there? More Percys: father, moth- er, and two children, all deaf and dumb, but one child, who can hear, and chatter like a bobo- link." "Deaf and dumb-the whole family, al- most!" echoed Frank, inexpressibly shocked. "That is a rather common infirmity in our neighborhood-at least it crops out in a dozen families or so; but all springing from the same root. Even potatoes won't grow forever in the one soil. It reconciles me to all my children's marrying off the island. All the young men ought to be sailors, and find wives from abroad; but that's not altogether a good reason for set- tling away." This brought Frank's thoughts strongly back to Alfred and Margaret; and lie went home pondering, but fully prepared to let things take their own course. "Unless somebody tries to get 'em in a tan- gle!" was his mental reservation; in which case he resolved manfully to interfere. Nevertheless, he couldn't forbear giving Mar- garet and all the others a very full account that evening, when they had assembled on the hill- top, of all their neighbors round about, Al- fred Brand included. He followed Captain Giles's version minutely, with a few flourishing additions gathered from his own fancy, which were vastly entertaining to his parents, and gave Margaret time to ponder deeply in her own heart every thing which he had said in earn- est. Later on in the evening, and for many even- ings after, when the "red-winged black-bird" had perched in the shadow on his distant rock, Frank never resisted the temptation of private- ly calling Margaret's attention to the fact, gravely asking her whether he was really " car- rying coals to Newcastle," by his friendly wish to point out one of the most interesting fen- tures of the neighborhood. Farther than this he was neutral-stoutly resolving upon entire non-intervention.    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5826-00000015"/> CHAPTER VIL. A YOUNG ATA-N INT SEARCH3 OF A WIFE.   POSSIBLY Alfred Brand was a little morbid in his ideas of young women, else lie would Ilardly bavo reached the age of twenty-five with- out once being seriously in love. Under all the unkempt roughness of the man, there was the poetic dream of a beautiful life, made noble and unselfish by sharing it freely with another; but then, that other must give as much as stle received, both in hearty, unfeigned love, and in every thing generous and disinterested. A thoroughly practical man, yet he was an inveterate dreamer ;, and this was always the one burden of his--dream: He must Ilave a noble-hea-rted, sensible wife; though lie, could do very well without beauty, or education, or wealth. There were nice -irls in abundarnce, with whom he was more or less acqluainlted-somc of tthem a great deal too good for ilim, as he re- gretfully atcknowledged in confidence with him- self ; for hec was shy, awkward, and self-distrust-' ful in mtatters of tliis kind. The world had been a good practical sebool-mistress to him in every-day, affairs, but in all the details of re- fined breeding, his rough, stern teacher had left him %wholly ou-tside in the cold; and lie felt hiis deficiencies. And yet, someiow,,alltthi nice girls were either wanting in something which lie regarded as essential, or else, for some other cause, they didn't get on well together. Of course, it was all his own' fault, he know that; but it only made it all tire more vexatious. He was a prickly, green burr, trying to fasten him- self on to something as smoothi fresh, and deli- cate as a porcelain vase; but all the becst Yases that he knew wanted flowers as bright and showy as morning-glories; and theyr shrank away from the prickly, green burr, as it seemed to bim, with a blind but unerring instinct. The sunny side of a girl's character was al- ways especially attractive to him, as it generally is to 'most people ; but lie could have borne to be   pricked pretty sharply, and often, with the nee. dles of a good-natured wit. He would never llave pricked backr again ; though lie would have ratlicr enjoyed the zest and piquancy of the Oling even where lie himself was chiief sufferer. i sense of humor was of the eminently apprecia- tive order; but it was not at all developed ifito a creative faculty of which he was himself the happy possessor-. Indeed, he was habitually conscious of being particularly deficient in this respect. All the hidden springs of his own being seemed to be always vibrating with a wirv and intense earnestness, and be was extremel. dis- satisfied at Iiis fully-recognized lack of general sprightliness and versatility. It had always prevented his being a boon companion or esDC- cial,&amp;jvorite among the great fratcrity of jolly sailors; yet lie always souglit, out the youngest and merriest of the crew, and sat down in the midst of jokes and laughter in something of the, mood in which a quiet old tabby likes to be surrounded by her playful kittens. Occasion- ally be would put out a paw and poke the othi- ers up, or would give them a pat if they became too boisterous; but to think of frisking and ca- peringf himself, was whollyr out of the questions Alfred was an extremist in nothing except in a peppery sensitiveness over his own defects, or those of any thing, or any one else, in whom he was especially interested. Yet even this sen- sitiveness was often internal; for he was gener. ally too proud to make it manifest. It might be the II worm P' the bud " of his happiness ; but there was no placard put up outside to adver- tise the public of that fact. He was -conscientious, but had never consid- ered himself to be in the least religious. He had never joined a temperance society, and could freecly drinl-- grog on an 6ecasion--espe- cially after any unusual exposure ; but he always scorned to use it melrely as a bevlerage.. He   could smoke an immense pipe with all the phlegfm, and some of the enjoyment, of a gen- uine Dutcliman; but he disliked the smell of stale smoke among his books and clothes, and his own little attic room was never polluted with it. Segars were a luxury in which he rarely indulged;i and in general, when the stim- "11is of tobacco was weighed in the balance with flie! cost of it, tobacco went up till it flew quite out of his halnds ; but it never got into his mouthi or nose, as something to chemv or sniff. Moreover, Alfred swore now and then, and sometimes even very desperately, under exceed- ing provocation; yet he despisect himself so licartily for it afterwtards, that he was not like- ly to be very often guilty of repeating the of- feiise. Low, coarse, vulgar language was so utterlly hateffil to him, that he was never guilty of that, even in a mornent of fiercest anger. Tiiis was the young man who was in search of a wife. He was generally Ifather it favorite withi other young men, and not at all1 disliked by3 the young ladies; so that Iris prospects were not considered discouraging. Having fully de- termined that it was best to be married wlicn lie could find the proper person, he had been -quietly prospecting for some months. But it is wonderful lioow mi-my obstacles lie found in: the c way. A voting man` who is farscinated by evC1,v pretty girl lie meects, bas no idea, of it. He could strip into matrimony through any one of it hundred easily-opened doors with about eqlual zest; but this young man had been look-- irig all his life, and yet had found no accdpta- ble approach. Hec had seen charming visions of grace and beauty,, which lingered in his thoughts long af-I terwardls;  but these were the bri-ht particular  stars, revolving in orbits so remote from his ownv as to be quite inaccessible. Hle had dlrcamed  otothers--humble, and wholly %within his own  sphere--had created them as an artist does his  picture or hiis statue before lie gives it embodi-  mecnt; but he could neither mantifacture nor  discover the living duplicate. Besides, he could  not possibly advertise blis wishes like a street- i crier, so that every lady friend might be enlist- t edl to help him; and if any one guessed at the r situation and came forward  as volunteer, this r sent him off in it tangent directly.  It was strange that he was so perversely cold- I licarted. He reproached himself for it bitterly; fi but taking himself to task didn't in the least g ,mendthematter.    Finally, hegaveuptheIdeaz ti of ever getting into that state of verve fervid fas- b cination to which all his young friends were so prone. He would first choose the nwife, and b   e then compel himself to love her. But even 1- that task was not easy. He selected and re- Fjected from among all the fairest flowers, till ]IC Iwas half disgusted w7ithl all youlng-wonianhood, I and wholly disgusted with Himself. O t last lie drew up a list of all the eligible - parties of his acquaintance, either on the island ,4 or off of it. It embraced nearly every woman c! he had ever known who was neither married s nor engaged, and who was somewhere between the ages of fifteen and thirty; and lie went over I all the names one by one, like a Catholic tell- ing his beads, with a longing that was almost a prayer in itself, for the wisdom to make a sensi- ble decision. At the very first sitting, nine out of every ten names wclre ruled out, because of some supposed incompatibility either of taste or temper. Re coolly wrote out the revised list and burned up the old one over the lamp, smiling grimly and viciously as lie did so--it was lato Iat night, in the priracy of Iris own room, writh his door locked and boltedl. Two-thirds of his grievous dissatisfaction Irecoiled upon himself. It was lie who was in fault, not the young la- dies; and he really pitied himself profoundly, at the same time that lie pronouncedi his own "solemn -condemnation. The'new list was'comparatively a small onle, yet it still contained about a baker's dozen; and the poor fellow went over these with pros and cons so often, that he fairly surrounded himself byaahalo of young women. Heewas the central figure, with his bristling red bair; and around this were grouped curls aind braids and frizzes of evelrr hue from the fairest flaxen to a jet black. WPhen the image of any young lady be- came pre-eminently attractive, lie invented some pretext for seeing the original; but after a few of such casual meetings he was' invariably dis- enchanted, and another name was stricken off frorr the Irapidly diminishing list, till only three or four remained. After philosophically studying these--all ex- ceedingly charming young persons-as conven- ient opportunity offered, he at last harlf decided to offer biniself to a, bright-eyed, gentle, and rich neighbors who was always as fresh as a rose-bud, and without the thorns. This was Mary, youngest daughter of Captain Hezekiahl Percy. The father, who was the most digni- fled retired cnptain on the island, was always gracious to Alfred ; and the young lady chat- ted with him as freely as though she bad not been a year and a half at boarding-school. Certainly he was not exactly in love with her; but he Iiad determined that he would be,    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5826-00000016"/> when his mind was once made up to win her love in return He had known Mary Percy all I her life-had carried her over rough places in  the old school days more than a hundred times; r and he always said hopefully to himself, when  he thought it over, "She is so young, she will I be all I shall want in time!"  He never dreamed of saying, "She is all I want!" So he still wavered and waited. Mary was already twenty-one, and, having no  other vocation, would have taken very kindly to ' housekeeping; but the perverse man, deploring his own unparalleled obstinacy of heart, could never bring himself to a positive decision. He even thought of doing a few years' further pen- ance by renting his beloved farm, and plunging once more into the midst of his kindred North- ern icebergs in pursuit of whales. Before this crisis arrived, Margaret drifted across his path; and straightway every one else seemed wholly out of the question. "Let me take the basket, Mrs. Warner; there is room enough for it here, and Miss Fannie can sit nicely on my lap." This was what lie heard Margaret say, in a voice which arrested his attention even before he had seen her face. All were intent, on that well-remembered afternoon, upon stowing themselves comforta- bly in the very limited space afforded by the sloop Constance, and Margaret's cheerful tones contrasted charmingly with others a good deal less considerate. Some slight had been cast upon the certainly not very ample accommoda- tions of the little craft, and the partisan proprie- tor felt rather piqued at the time. lie watched Margaret, who was sitting upright on a box, contentedly holding Fannie on her lap, and an umbrella over the head of the invalid gentle- man. This continued for the first half-hour of their sail; and she became a heroine to him even before he had caught a glimpse either of her clear, frank eyes or of the ugly pock-marks on her sunny face. From that hour forward it was impossible to put her out of his thoughts. He contrived to meet her everywhere; often exchanging a brief word or a smile, and sometimes indulging in a more prolonged conversation. He thought he read her character as an open page, and his heart surrendered without a question, dreaming deliciously over his good-fortune for some days. All theice of his nature melted with a fervent heat. Alfred went about for a week or two with a perpetual song of triumph in all his thoughts. "Eureka I Eureka! I have found her! I have found her!"   Better than all, at last he had found himself. lie really was not the insensible monster who had so exasperated him lately that he was ready to invent a liturgy of anathemas against his Maker. He was only afraid now of repel- ling Margaret by his own hasty and too ardent affection. Very naturally, Margaret, from her isolation and her real warmth of nature, responded al- most unconsciously to the always respectful, earnest tenderness and good-will which ex- pressed itself in every look and gesture. Al- fred himself was wholly unaware how very plainly his sentiments had been thus unwit- tingly revealed to her. The figure, perched so quietly every twilight on the gray stone, and trying to conceal itself in the deepest shad- ow, gave her a comforting new sense of being thought of and watched for by one so respecta- ble and sensible as the sailor-farmer; and her frequent reveries in those days were not at all unpleasant. When Margaret and the children were seen flitting along the sands, chasing the ebb and flow of the waves by moonlight, this was some- thing to touch a heart far less susceptible than Alfred's; but Margaret's movements became more and more constrained under a sense of his perpetual presence. She thought more and fiolicked less-as was but natural. She often sat through half the evening, in- tently watching the jet of rushing foam speed- ing with a wild dash along the crest of the breaking wave and vanishing against the dis- tant bank. Then her eye came back again like a pendulum, nud watched the same process over and over as it was endlessly repeated. In daylight, the wave always seemed to break all at once in a long line of leaping white spray, and only at night did it become a live thing driven inward by some dark object behind-at last suddenly shooting off sideways in a rush of passionate frenzy. This fascinated Marga- ret as she sat wholly outside of it all, a passive observer. It stimulated a vague feeling that her woman's nature had need to treasure up a world of enduring and waiting patience over events which she was powerless to influence; yet she was hopeful now, and, like the sea, her feelings were beating to and fro in tides of un- controllable unrest; but Alfred, sitting alone on his distant rock, often likened her to a statue, pulseless and immovable. Then, evening after evening, Mr. Warner wanted his cloak, or his slippers, or a draught of water, which Margaret went cheerfully to bring; or Mrs. Warner needed some of the   thousand little changes, which, as simple mat- ter of course, Margaret alone could effect for her. No sense of degradation was attached to these perpetually exacting services in Marga- ret's mind. They needed her; and she had learned to care for them almost unceasingly- something as she would have cared for her own little children, if she had been a mother to be- loved helplessness. Alfred, who was born and reared a practical democrat, entirely failed to understand this. On the boat, Margaret's helpfulness had seem- ed charmingly natural. He understood the spirit in which it was both given and received, and had found it all wonderfully refreshing. But then he was in the very midst of it all, and was better qualified to judge. Now he was sitting afar off, and looking on from the outside. Then Margaret was only a stranger. Now he felt a personal interest in her, and in his thoughts had already appropriated her to himself It rasped him to be so perpetually re- minded of her servile position, and he began to "ccuse her of a want of proper self-respect. Ice had waited so long for a divinity whom ]ie could sincerely worship; and now to find that even his accepted idol was only part of iron and part of potter's clay! He felt wronged and de- frauded. He had fallen in love with a good and gen- crous woman, without even once thinking of her being an Irish servant-girl, and it exasperated him to be so perpetually reminded of this un- pleasant fact. Possibly his very democracy was intensely aristocratic, and so continually gnaw- ing into itself. He believed he was indignant, not that Margaret was the servant of others-- he had been that himself, and thought the posi- tion an honorable one; but he was vexed and irritated at what he interpreted to be a spirit of servility shown in, so willingly and continually waiting upon those who might often better have served themselves. Iis face grew hot and angry out there in the darkness, when he saw her "so continually on the trot," and his most fervent indignation light- ed on Margaret herself for consenting to become "such a pack-horse." He privately anathe- matized II that fine gentleman, Frank," who was only "a donkey under his lion skin," and re- fused any longer to be civil to him when they met. How was Alfred to comprehend how much C   of all this was merely the force of habit? How was he to know that both Margaret and the "fine gentleman" himself regarded poor Frank in the light'of an over-worked martyr, bound to a great, relentless, Boston tread-mill, where he toiled early and late; and that this, his first long vacation in years, was coveted for him by both as a sorely-needed holiday? When Margaret trudged down, therefore, from their evening hill, loaded with a large, uphol- stered chair, it never troubled her. She was too strong, physically to feel it a burden-too well armored, mentally, to even think of it. They had no other servant in the house at present. The Mayboughs  washed, scrubbed, ironed, and baked, and Anne and Fannie were practising the lighter housewifely arts under Margaret's supervision; so that her proper vocation for the summer was double-lobed-branching into the details of waiting, on the one hand, and house- keeping on the other. But Alfred, looking on from the dark outside, was learning to tear his own red hair, and anathematize himself afresh for getting himself so hopelessly in love with one who at bottom was so evidently only a mean- spirited drudge. Having begun to despise Margaret for her supposed faults, his manners changed, and most inevitably hers changed also. She reproached herself for having been too easily influenced. She even questioned if it were possible that she had misunderstood his attentions and his real sentiments, becoming now proportionately dis- trustful and reserved; or she used pleasant laugh- ter and sharp sallies of repartee as the conven- ient cloak most easily manufactured to conceal her real feelings. Sometimes when they met, as they were still sure to do very often, they smiled or blushed and chatted a little; but oft- ener they only bowed coldly, passing on with af- fected dignity and indifference. Frank still whispered Margaret good-natured- ly about the " rock-bird ;" but, finding that she either blushed painfully or looked moody, he de- sisted, without even asking an explanation, and soon he had forgotten the whole matter, sup- posing that nothing was likely to come of it. He rejoiced at that. Alfred, also, sorrowfully and angrily by turns, wished profoundly that he could forget-that he could even go back again to all the dearth and iciness of his old insensibility; but this was out of the question..    <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5826-00000017"/> CHAPTER VII MUT:UUALLY BENEFT   MRS. SALATHEL, as Frankl always persisted  in calling Mrs. Maybough, in admiration of Cap- tain Giles, was a native of "the. main land," but a residdent on the island since her marriage. She was tall, strong, and dark-eyed, with a long, free step worthy of a princess. Tile life-long habit of walking upon the sands had given her, like many others, a peculiar mode of lifting her feet, and, added to this, she had an indescribably easy carriage and freedom of movement which not one in tilousands could ever hope to imi- tate. There was a little, also, both of protest -and resolution in every step and attitude; something which said, "I can not 'overcome the ills of life, but I will trample over them and half ignore their existence."  The first time the Bo0ston family saw her walk, they all sat in open - eyed admiration. She had gone down to the sea to bathe her feet, after a weary morning's work, happily un- conscious that there were any eye-witnesses; aind as she strode over the beach in search of a sandy point with put pebbles, thinking' more cheerfully than usual of the good pay which 1ends its sutnshine even to weariness--,now andi then unconsciously lifting her dress a little in anticipation of the turbulent waves-Mrs. War- ner exclaimed, with sudden and unusual inter- est, "Did you ever see a more unstudied or a more elegant movement?", "It is worth fifty cents to see it done!" cried Frank. "Such a walk as that on Becacon Street! wouldn't people stop to look?" Molly was paddlingf on at her mother's side-- a rough, rolypoly little figure, bigh-shouldered, and with the irregular child's step, but pretty, by wayy of simple contrast; and in the rear were two small boys, with trowsers, rolled up to -their tltmost, prancing to and fro like frisky ponies. They all stopped at nearly the'same moment, waiting upon the outer edge of the line of in- coming waves; and as the white spray came tumbling over their feet, the children sent up a shout of delight-one Ion ' trill of musical treble amidst the ever-soundina bass.   "Those May  uglisa redecterminedtoobe pic. turesque,"' said er Warner, lalfvexed. "They are -like the flock of sheep that stood looking down at us the other da,.y from the great rock on the downs. Up there against the skry they were charming; but when they came running past us,, lean, dirty, and sheared to the skin, the difference was wonderful." The foot-washers soon drew tanck from the water, the little ones running about in childish play, and the mother, seating herself on a rock, began putting on stockings and shoes, which till now she had carried in her hand. The long line of breakers came surging in every moment upon the shore; not turbulent, as in strong :qea, but quiet and self-poised, raising long bluish-gray crest just beyond the edge of the waters-lifting it so high that you could see the ligflt breaking through the transparent thin layer of compactt fluidl and then .slipplingr suddenly over the retreating under-tow with a shimmer of pearls and a sudden dash of spirit which never lost its fascination, even when end-- lessly repeated. On either band, but at some distance away, the high banks extended outt into the sea, bluff, irregular promontories; and outside of each of these was a straggling group of -rocks nearly covered at high tide, but at low tide lifting up their black and gray heads to break any possible monotony of view. And now at half tide the surf. rushed over them in white, broken masses, like an ever-restless drovc of white steeds dashing heroicall oe  tetgrpos- ing difficulties. Far out upon one rock you could catch the outline of a single blackr duck,, sitting alone in solitary state. "There's the fisherman, mother," called the little Maybouglis, pointing out to him. , "I've seen him sitting there ever since we started.", "So he is;," and the ready, smile came to the mother's eye, This was a sad-eyed wom- an, who seldom bsmiled without some outside stimulus to call 'up the always transient glim- mer; but it camd at the very first word of child   or husband. Now she re-commenced brushing tile sand from her foot, and putting on the shoe she had held extended in her hand while she looked off' alone the sea. Presentlythe whole cgroup) was seen approaching the place where the Wanrners were seated. The mother hesitated a moment when she became conscious of the near presence of her neighbors, and then came stead- ily -forward, as a self-respecting Matssachusetts %woman should. I was going to your house, Mrs. WaYrrner, to inquire about the sewing." "Yes, that was right; but I can explain to y'ou here.") While Mrs. Warner is explaining, we can look more closely at Mrs. Salathiel. Her hands and face arc a's brown and horny as any farmer's in hlarvest-time. And well they may be; for 9he hals done Ilalf the work in a large garden this spring, and, with Moll .'s help out of school-. Ilours, the work of the household besides. Tile bo  face tells of care and patience, and the firmly-shut mouth says more plainly than words could that there is still an exhaustless stock of enduring energy. "I am ready to bear any thiiug which humanity must bear for the'satke of these," is the language of the mother-look as "Iie turns to the'children who are just spoken of by the lady; but the language of the great brown-black, sad eyes is not easily translated. Thellre aire women with eres- like this. I have seen a good many o f them in different places,I expressing various degrees of some kindred sen-  timent; but I ean not wholly  read the always  steritotyped words they utter, though I have studied the sub ject a good deal.  When the eyes speak in this way, the tongue I is generally silent; for it is not many souls who E need a double language for expressing a. current feib  I think the feeling itself is often in- x definite even when most powerful.  Frank re- c memberedl Captain Giles's remark on the instant:: I)Irs. Salathiel  ought to have been a captinag s Ilcrself, if ever a woman should;" but she was not it captain-was nothing but a volunteer on 'I board a very much shattered craft filled with bk Ilelp-less passengers ; and though she was ael- y: Nvays working at the pumps with a strong arm,  3'et if she could have got into any sound boat o1 arnd taken the helm into her own hand, I think tile sadness would have gone out of her eyes per- a manecntly, as it arlwaysdid now Wvhenever she, e turned to sympathize with one of her children. si The neighbors said simply, "None of her owri y folks live here!" and that seemed to explain I ,every thing.  She herself assented. "'I am  away frolil all my own folks," was her only ac- tl   'count of the matter; but if she suffered with e, homesickness, yet all that makes Ilome most  dear was here with her. If this pair had ac- a cepted certain modern theories of good donies- tic economy, the wife would have 'gone into i some 'Outside business, while the invalid hus- rband cooked the dinners, teaching all his boys -and little Molly to help him. As it was, tile s wife eked out the, crippled husba-nd in the gar- den, but she never rested in the house; and so, poor thing, no wonder she was always tired. AA man's work, but awoman's wages, might well make any mother of four young children sad- eyed, if iuncomplaining. Mrs. Warner felt something of this whcn she said, with a touch of compunction, "I)on't let me put more upon you than you are able to get done comfortably, Mrs. Maybough.. You are attempting a great deal already in addition to the work of your own family. If the sewing is too much, pray don't even try to do it." "But I would rather you gave it to me, Mrs. Warner. It's a rest from harder work ; and I shall be glad if I can do it neatly enough to suit YOU:" "Wecll, take time for it; I likre it neatly done, but the piece you sent home did vclrr well. Dob it as nicely as you can, and I slian't mind paying you a good price." "Fine sewing used to be much easier to me than it is now," said the woman, a glow rising perceptibly over the brown skin; "but the skill will come again by practice. My fingers are stiffecned a little by rougher work." "I-don't see how your husband does any ttlingi at all in liis present feeble state, Mrs. Mvaybough? His garden shows work; but I shouldWt think him able to give it." "It's a great comfort to my husband to begin work -again ; but of course lie can not do much, and so the children and I help him all we can." "You have had a hard time, haven't you?" ssaid the lady, with real sympathy. "Not nearly so hard as many, I suppose; bhut I can not forget that what you will pay me will be watrm clothing for us all next winter. Lasst year, for the want of it, Molly had to stay at home nearly all the late fall, though she is fond of school."' A softened intonation came into the voice, and a mistiness needed to be swept offlftom the eyes before they could see clearly again. But she went on steadily: "'Give me all the work yon have, Mrs. Warner, and if I find it too much I will tell you." -"None of the children are in school now, are they T'    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5826-00000018"/> "We have only six months' school-in the spring and fall. In the winter it is too cold and stormy for the children to walk so far, and in summer they are needed at home. They must all make the most of half the time." The three little Mayboughs stood together with open mouths, listening; and as Frank looked at then, it seemed to him that in all three there was a wonderfully odd resemblance to the faces of some fishes he had seen. Their eyes were a little cast down, a great blanket of shyness cov- cring up every ray of intelligence; and the cor- ners of all the little mouths were so drawn down, even after they were closed, that the little shut- eyed perch he had caught in the charming pond came irresistibly to his mind-the one seem- ing to be a funny caricature of the other. "Do you mean to be a sailor, little fish?" he asked laughingly of Ben, the eldest. "I am not a fish," said Ben, sturdily, "and I'm going to learn a trade when I grow up." "What will you be, then?" "It doesn't matter," said the boy, defiantly. "But won't you be a sailor when you are a, man?"    -  "No; mother doesn't like it." "But you can't be a captain on land." "It doesn't matter," repeated the child, turn- ing his back and walking off. He was dis- pleased with the fun, and perhaps ridicule, which he saw peeping out of Frank's eyes; and the young gentleman rather relished the rebuke. A little way off the boy stopped, carefully roll- ing down the hem of his trowsers, which had been left turned up since his foot-bath, and then faced about, waiting for his mother. "His name is Ben," said the youngest boy, in a tone of apology.       d. "You are a nice little shrimp," said Frank, patting the little cheek under its scanty round cap; " and I thought his name was Perch; but of course I was mistaken. You must give him some of these, and tell him so."He dealt out a handful of bonbons, smiling as the boy's eyes lighted with pleasure. "I thank you," replied young five years old, scampering away. Frank came forward now, and spoke to the mother with the deference of a genuine respect. "Mrs. Maybough, I have engaged your hus- band to saw a cord of wood for us. Was it right for me to propose it? I was afraid after wards that the work was too hard for him." "Thank you!" she answered, in a tone which Mr. Warner thought was cold and uncivil; but Frank saw her hand go up to her throat as though she were struggling with emotion. It   seemed an odd little pause while they waited for her to speak. "He will do a little at a time, I suppose, as he is able. We are glad of the work."She merely bowed to them all, and went off almost as abruptly as little Ben had done. "Takes it easily," said the invalid gentle- man, with a long sigh. "It's one of the great- est providences that every tree is adapted to just the little patch of mother earth it grows in. Some of them must spring in the clefts of the hardest rocks. I suppose the oak-can't change to an aspen if it would; but it's more useful, perllaps." Frank opened his eyes with a stare, and was on the point of opening his mouth also; but catching his mother's eye, he thought better of it, and walked away along the shore. A little fishing -boat had been lying off in the water just in sight, and this was now seen slowly coming to land. It was rowed by a single man; but a boy sat also in the boat; and jump- ing first on shore, helped draw it up on to the *, sanr". "Did you have good luck?" asked Frank, sauntering up leisurely, and lending a land in the final haul to the boat. "Well, no, I didn't. I kinder forgot my ccl- skin." "Your eel-skin!" chcoed Frank, mystified. "Yes; can't fish without bait." Oh! you'll try it again I suppose, then?" "No ; guess not. It's most night, and rowin' isn't child's play. Wind and tide are against me, you see. That's always my luck." "You won't want me any more, I suppose, Mr. Dennis?" said the boy. "No; you can go back to diggin' for your pa." "Is that a young Maybough?" asked Frank, I who had recognized a likeness to the other little fish-mouthed branches of the common stock. "Yes; he didn't row, so he can hoe," said Mr. Dennis, making a feint of drawing up coat- s tails which were not there-for he wore a sol- dier's blue jacket with brass buttons in all their glory. Having adjusted the imaginary append- ages, he seated himself deliberately upon the sand. "You have been in the war, r suppose, Mr. - Dennis?" t  Frank having caught the strangpyis name - from the child, seated himserso, ready to make the acquaintance of every genuine native. "I enlisted, but I only waited round to New t Bedford, and got back without a fling. The s war collapsed sudden at last. Got badly pricked, t and shrunk up like a worn-out old bladder, you   know. It was the wind from that last puff of General; Grant's great bellows that blew me home again without a scratch or a scar." "Were you glad or sorry,i I wonder?" "Well, maybe a little of both. The flavor was a good deal mixed-sweet and sour in the same cupful, like lemonade. There was a pret- ty strong Hand on the helm of that war-ship, I conjecture. It brought her into port a little too soon for some of my private plans, but I didn't grumble. I never expected to be a general, and wasn't over-anxious for a ball to be lodged any- where under my skin. But I would like to have done just alittle something patriotic after I had fairly set out to." "It was too bad," said the listener, in a tone of sympathy, and with an inward struggle to keep back a smile. "I wanted to go, all along, but my sister wouldn't hear of it at first; and she is all I've got to look to." "You are not married, then?" "She is as good for me as a wife and ten children, I judge. I'm near fifty, but she's four years to the fore, if not a little more." "You like poetry, Mr. Dennis?" "Take one, young man?" said Mr. Dennis, slipping two stumpy pipes out of his pocket, and offering the best to his neighbor. " Poetry can ie, lit up from the end of this. I've seen spirits before now -black, white, and gray-dancing like moonbeams in a good whiff of smoke." Frank coughed a little. "Don't you choke, that's no joke; and don't you croak. But take it, if you like it." "Thank you, butit's an accomplishment not in my line." "Have some tooth-polish, then?" handing over a paper of tobacco. "Nor that either: I've never learned how." "Not! and you straight from Boston? There's hardly a boy on the island who don't do one or t'other, or both." "Have you caught many fish lately, Mr. Den- - ,is?" "Well, I went out the other day and got into a real shoal of 'em--blue-fish biting round enough to have given me half a barrel; but an ugly fellow got hold of my hook, and the line was kinder weak, perhaps, and away he went scot free." "You nean away he went with your hook for booty, don't you?" "That's about it; and I never thought to take a second hook, so I lost the chance that time, and haven't been since till to-day. That's why I forgot the eel-skin, likely-getting up a new   tackle. Now I'll wait till there's wind enough to carry sail one way at least. There's a kind of Providence in every thing, I expect. I didn't mean to forget the eel-skin." "Of course not." "Of course not; and if I feel stirred up any day to go fishing from any thing either inside of me or from outside, I always go; but I don't know that it's best to be forever beating the sea because it won't give me a living with a free will. If a sparrow doesn't fall to the ground without the Governor up there taking notice, then I calculate not a wave in the sea lifts its head without, and not a fish bites the hook or don't bite it, as the case may be." Mr. Dennis jerked his eyes upward as he spoke-not at all religiously or reverentially- but with a look and tone of the most every-day, entire conviction. "It is best to measure every thing squarely by the same rule. The old minister who ex- pounded the law from the inside of that old finger-pointer upon the hill there said so, and I have always as much believed in it as I have in the bread-and-butter that I grew up on. Ile's gone, and the church stands without an echo; but I accept the doctrine." "I suppose you are right," replied Frank, rather at a loss as to whether, he was expected to look edified or amused; but concluding that, on the whole, he was a little of both. "Of course I am right-makes day out of night; that is my delight." Mr. Dennis turned a little away, and smoked for some five minutes as if for dear life. "That's a thousand times better than grog, young man," he said, facing about again, evi- dently comforted. "It kills the raw edge of sea- air twice as well. Never touch that, whatever happens-unless, maybe, you've been drowned and are just coming to life again." "I am likely to follow your advice." "Better do it." "Is fishing generally profitable work, Mr. Dennis?" Mr. Dennis gave a droll sidelong glance at Frank, and then, taking out his pipe, puffed away a great mouthful of smoke. "O4nest about like that!" rising at once to his feet. "I wish you good-day; I've but little time to play, for I never get a holiday." "Good-day, and I hope for further acquaint- ance." Frank got up also, and made a deferential bow at parting. An hour after, on returning home, he found Mr. Maybough sawing at the wood-pile, while little Ben played quietly at his    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5826-00000019"/> side. Frank slipped up stairs, and sat looking out at them from his window. Presently the crippled wood-sawyer, shaking with the palsy, stopped to rest, wiping the perspiration from his forehead with a dark cotton handkerchief. "Run in and bring me a kitchen chair, Ben. I must rest a little; and I guess I can split this sitting down." Ben was only seven, and short for his age; but he came tugging the chair like a sturdy little hero as he was, and placing it for his fa- ther, he said, "Now, which stick, pa? I could split the little ones, if you would let me." '4 No; you place them, Ben, just as they come. That's right."As the child leaned the stick against the log he drew back. The father split it into fragments, and then rested while Ben threw the small sticks into a pile and laid an. other large one in place. It was small gnarled oak--such as is most abundant on an island only twenty miles long-and was by no means easy to work; but they toiled on, father and child, sometimes silent, and sometimes chatting cozily over all the events of the neighborhood. Frank looked out from his window like one fascinated. This trembling, crippled man and this baby building up his wood-pile, and he looking idly on. His sense of the fitness of things was a good deal disturbed, and he kept vaguely reasoning to himself: "These May- boughs are not beggars; they wish to work and be paid for it." By-and-by Margaret came to them. "Mr. Maybough, Mrs. Warner sends word that some of the wood should be cut fine for kindlings."   "Yes," he answered, "I'll cut it so." "But it doesn't matter much, after all," said Margaret, looking on with sympathy as he worked. "I 'can use the hatchet myself. So, if you can do the large splitting, I will do the small as I use it, and you needn't trouble about it at all. It's but little I shall want, at any rate, especially if I burn peat." ' Bravo, Margaret!" said Frank, sotto voce; his eyes beaming cordial approval, "and I'll use one plate and tea-spoon less for every meal, to make up for it; and offer my arm seven times oftener to father every week," he mentally add- ed, with a slight shrug and a little laugh. "Poor father," he thought, more seriously, after a mo- ment; "he has suffered intensely, and I deserve hanging! He would take out his eyes any time to give them to me or to any of us, if we were in real need of them." Thus wholesomely pricked in his conscience, Frank straightway laid hold of "Pickwick" and began reading aloud to his father, who had been sitting discontentedly, smoking his cigar in the shade of the house. Mr. Warner joined in the laugh over poor Mr. Pickwick's adven- tures in the pound, till the tears rolled down his cheeks; and he declared himself half ready to join a hunting-party himself-if he could only go in a wheelbarrow. A faultless white handkerchief extra went into Mrs. Maybough's wash the next Monday thereafter; but as they paid by the piece, a hand. kerchief innocently wet with tears of laughter only amounted to another item of Mr. Frank's unwonted charities.   CHAPTER IX. TREASURES FOR THE BELOVED.   ALFRED BRAND, sleeping in a small attic room athis cousin's, woke one gray early morn- ing and thought of Margaret. Indeed some thought of her had dwelt with him almost per- petually, sleeping and waking; but his dreaming that night had been much more rainbow-tinted than his late disconsolate day-musings. Why Margaret interested him so much he could hard- ly have told himself. She had a pleasant, hon- est face, which almost any one would have called rather pretty, if the envious small-pox had not set its signet there; but as Alfred's thoughts rested on this defect, he felt that he could love her all the better for it. 'He wanted to care for something that stood in need of him!   He went back to the suffering which doubt- less accompanied the repulsive disease, and his heart softened with a manly wish to add joy and love as an offset, not only to the pain of body, but also to the necessary mental distress, which perhaps she sometimes felt keenly even now. Was it this which had kept others aloof? To be certain of that would have comforted him; for his feelings had already reached that exact- ing stage which could not easily brook a rival. A cloud had come between them of late; but was it any thing more than the empty, worth- less vapor of mischief and mistrust? It was ignoble in him to rest under this mere shadow of suspicion. He was at least bound to solve   his own doubts; and this was a duty which rested with himself alone. If he could have met Margaret freely-could have conversed with her without restraint for a single half hour, each might readily have un- derstood the other, and every thing would prob- ably have ended delightfully. Alfred had long felt this, and had even sought for an interview. He had called manfully at the house; but Margaret was away; and Mr. Warner, meeting him at the door, had kept him there without giving him an opportunity of stepping inside. Affable, but frigidly polite from the first, the master of the house had end- ed by warning off the visitor, and bidding him not to return. "You ask for our Margaret, sir; but Miss Margaret is a transient visitor here for the sum- mer; and it is quite unnecessary that you should trouble yourself to make her acquaintance. She finds society enough,' and quite suitable to her, in our own family. She was humbly born; but we have raised her in social standing, till we regard her as a friend-almost an equal; and we have far other plans for her than set- tling her permanently on this very retired, small island. "Indeed, sir,"Alfred had answered, with im- mense self-restraint, "I had not exactly called this evening to propose to you for the young lady's hand; but I suppose, even in that case, she would be allowed to speak for herself." "Of course! of course! but I am her guard- ian. You could hardly wish to seek her socie- ty if her friends all disapprove. Don't think of her again, young man. You are every way worthy in all respects, according to your posi- tion in life, I have not a doubt; but her sphere and yours are as wide asunder as the anti- plodes. She is a pearl to us, and not to be thrown away by the family that has protected her, during a summer's brief rustication. Your intentions are simply of a friendly nature, I presume; yet it would be more agreeable to us if your acquaintance with her was not farther continued. I am sure I wish you well as a very useful citizen, and one to whom we were all much indebted on our passage to this place. This is a very pleasant evening. Good-day, sir." Alfred's tongue was petrified, and he felt like a walking mummy under the first shock as he turned abruptly from the house. Was Margaret, then, another "bright partic- ular star," so high above him that even to ad- dress her respectfully was an insult? No; he had himself been insulted, and he had been  found wanting even in a proper spirit of resent-   ment. But the resentment was rising now to a fervid heat. He kicked at the insult vigorous- ly in the likeness of a potato-hill in his own fields through which he was passing; and wise- ly determined that it would be only manly to try with new vigor for this exceeding prize. The real question in his own mind was quite a different one. Was Margaret worthy of him? He must take time to settle this last query, and act accordingly. This morning a ray of insight into the real nature of the case had opened it out to him in a new light, and one full of encouragement. He had misinterpreted Margaret's simple good- nature-possibly had mistrusted her very best virtues. Who had made him judge, without even a fair and impartial trial? He rose on his elbow, and looked about his dingy room with a smile. It contained little except:his books, clothes, bed, and two sailor's chests, which served him also as chairs. His eye resting on one of these green-painted boxes, I the smile deepened. Slipping out on the bare floor, he tumbled himself into his clothes, and having locked the door and taken a chest-key from its hiding-place, he knelt by one of the boxes, and, opening it, began to examine the contents. It was a collection of odd treasures, chiefly sea-shells and other foreign curiosities, gathered in his boyhood from many far-off shores. In this island, where the legitimate ambition of more than half the boys is to become sea- captains, almost every house can display some reminiscence of distant travel. Rare shells lie upon the mantel, or peep out from some open drawer, or gleam from an out-of-the-way shelf in the strange company, perhaps, of flat-irons, squashes, and bundles of garden-seeds; or some provident, hopeful girl has them stored away with other keepsakes, as the nucleus of a future cabinet. Shell boxes and baskets ornament par- lor tables, and tasteful shell-frames, containing very choice and beautiful specimens of marine wealthy ennoble the common prints which orna- ment walls sand-finished or covered by brilliant, large-patterned paper. Wives and daughters who never perhaps went off the island even once in their whole lives, keep these gifts of husbands, fathers, brothers, and sweethearts, as beautiful suggestions of the tales that have been told to them, and of the strange things they instinctively long to see, but without once dreaming of ever doing so-for the feminine branches of a sailor's household stay I at home even more than other women-by way of keeping up the average of home care-taking.    <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5826-00000020"/> They are often more energetic and practical in outside business than most ladies; but their knowledge is frequently of a narrow and limited kind. "Sea-faring men are not only often away from home, but they form ties and associations differ- ent from their families; and the breach widens every year." So said a sensible spinster de- scended from a sailor's family, who is reported to have herself refused a sea-captain, remaining unmarried to this day; and her low voice of quiet conviction left an impression upon my mind which will not easily wear away. Men who receive the sharpening and polish- ing discipline of a wide experience, leaving their wives year after year pottering only in kitchen and nursery, wake up too often to a late sense of hopeless difference in development between those who should have gone hand in hand in all progress; but an enlarging civilization is stead- ily taking feminine humanity more and more into the counsels of male kindred, and into a practical share of their duties and experiences! Possibly the time may come when more families will accompany their sea-faring relatives on their voyages; the ship becoming more nearly n home where men, women, and children may share largely in common duties and common interests. If that day ever dawns, sailors will be better, no- bler, more self-respecting men, and their wives and daughters wiser and stronger women. Mean- time, mementos from foreign lands will remain treasured evidences to many that they have not been wholly forgotten by their absent loved ones. Alfred Brand bad a good deal of untrained love for all beautiful things. He had seen pretty trifles duly prized by the receiver, and had picked up many of his treasures, not only from real admiration of them, but with the thought of a possible sweet face which would one day bend over them admiringly, nestled close to his own. He had planned a neat, con- venient cabinet, which he himself would make- for he was a clever workman with tools-and had mused over the bright smiles beaming from  a vaguely-defined face, in acceptance of his col- lection as a bridal gift. This morning the face was Margaret's; and if it was not exactly pretty, it was sweet and bright enough to satisfy him entirely. One by one he spread out pearly and bright- colored, gleaming shells, over floor, and bed, and chests-assorting them in kindred groups, and remembering where he had gathered each. There were Cypreas - MaRp-Cowries, Poached Eggs, Money-shells, and their various mottled,   mouse-like kindred; smooth and beautiful Oli- vas; spiral, strongly-marked Turbos, the thorny Murex, and the silvery Sea-ear; oddly formed and prettily sculptured Bivalves; corals and bright pebbles, and multitudes of other treas- ures miscellaneously gathered from the anti- podes. Many of these had been originally pick- ed up by himself, and were rippling over with sunny memories. The great homely green and brown Turbo from Afiica, with its pearly lin- ing, the beautiful Venus's Comb from the Mo- luccas, and the immense blushing Conch-she l from Cuba, was each strongly marked in his calendar, and each was telling its own wonder- ful tale to his delighted ears. They were all in a rough, unpolished state; sea-weed, clay, sand, and barnacles still clinging to many of them; and these queer groups of parasites were sometimes even more beautiful than the shells to which they grew. Those seemed bright days, some of them not very long past, when he added to his treasures with the vague hope in his heart that there were yet brighter days rising one beyond an- other in the possible future. Was their rosy dawn coming to him already? and was it this which now flooded his morning heart with un- speakable, tender gladness? He knelt down and prayed as he used to long ago-offering up all the vague longing and thanksgiving of his soul, though he couldn't remember kneeling thus at his bedside before in many years; and he had passed through peril and storm time and again, when no prayer went up from his clouded heart. Suddenly the thought came to him that lie would at once burnish up all these treasures, putting them in the completest order for a bri- dal gift. So, gathering them all together again into the green chest, he shook out his yesterday- worn boots, piling up the little heap of sand which they contained, and, finding a bit of old flannel, selected one of the prettiest, parasite- laden shells, and sat down on his treasure-box in his red woollen shirt-sleeves, with his open I jack-knife, ready for work. The sun came peeping over the horizon just in time to witness the commencement of his task. Vinegar was an acid with which he was fa- miliar as a means of cleansing off the rough outside; but much could be done even without this, and he carefully scraped away the foreign substances with his knife, working on with in- finite painstaking. Then he took up the piece of old flannel, to commence rubbing with the sand; but there was no water in his room; for his washing was all done either in the great   salt-water basin outside or in the little wash- hand basin in the porch. His first impulse was to wet the cloth from his mouth; but no! he would not spit on any thing which might ever belong to Margaret; so, slipping the shell into his pocket, he went softly down stairs, where he found an old cup, which he filled from the water-pail. The opening of a door aroused the family; but he escaped to his room vithl the full cup, locking it carefully into his treasure-chest for future use. Putting the flannel and knife into his pocket, he pre- pared for the customary work of the day. When he reached his own little farm, lying along both sides of a great ancient sand-drift, now one of the pretty rolling hills of the region, he stood thinking of the best place to locate a house-looking off wistfully towards Margaret, and hoping to catch some glimpse of her before lie began work; but he saw no one except Mr. Warner, who was sitting in his arm-chair in the shade of the house. The cloud-cottage which had arisen up at his side tumbled down before the memories thus awakened, and his reddish face grew hotter than ever, indicative of his internal state. He turned his back, strid- ing hastily down to the farthest row of corn, and began a vigorous hoeing by way of having something to hit with a will. After some hours of work, Alfred sat down, hidden in the midst of the long rows of broad green leaves. First looking cautiously about him with a little shamefacedness at the con- sciousness of his loving task, and wetting his bit of flannel with some of the water he remem- bered bringing inf his tin can for drinking, he dipped it in the sandy earth and began polish- ing his shell, with the cheerful face which he had worn in the morning. "A little oil now," he said in a low tone to himself, "and it will do nicely." -Ic turned it this way and that in the sun- light, smiling as he admired its increased beauty. "I beg pardon of the wasted barnacles. Some of them were too pretty to be scraped away; but they got out of their places!" he said, with a shrug and a laugh. Then he smoothed and polished again. "Margaret must like shells. I have seen her picking up the common little things about here and hoarding them as if they were jewels. I should like to drop this somewhere on the Leach, if I was only sure she would find it. Wolddn't she look surprised? But those chil- dren are always on hand." Alfred put the shell regretfully back into his   own pocket, and started home to dinner; but he grew a little cross as he walked. "It must be a stupid thing never to be alone, morning, noon, or night. I couldn't abide it, and I wouldn't!" and, feeling what he thought to the tips of his toes, he kicked at an unfortu- nate corn-stalk with a force which nearly tore the poor thing up by the roots. Directly after he met Frank Warner, who came singing across the field, like any easy- going boy enjoying a holiday. "Halloo, Alfred! Sailor or farmer to-day?" he called, merrily, as he approached, "A man all the time, Mr. Frank," replied Alfred, sullenly, passing hastily on. "The dickens I What's in the wind, I won- der? I can't,make him out. I guess he won't, do for Margaret after all. He's as full of points as a weather-cock, so I won't burn my fingers for him, as I have been ready to do half a dozen times lately." From that time Frank supposed that the love- making was all over. That afternoon, as Alfred and a little son of Captain Percy's were driving a hay-cart to the meadow, they overtook Margaret and the two children. "Oh, Mr. Alfred, please do let us ride!" cried Fannie. "I want so much to ride in a hay-cart with oxen; and so we all do. Don't we, Margaret?" "Whoa!" called a heavy, deep voice, un- steady with joy and doubt; and as the will- ing oxen came to a stand-still, the driver looked with eager questioning into Margaret's face. "Yes, Mr. Alfied, the children have been, longing for a drive after the oxen ever since we came here." "Come in, then," springing blithely to the ground, and lifting Fannie high over the hay- rigging. But Margaret began to scramble up unassisted, and her lover felt as if she were intentionally giving him the cold shoulder. The children were riding in a chariot of de- light, and Margaret, wholly unconscious of offense, was as sunny-tempered as the cloudless sky overhead. At length Alfred, though a little more cautious than before of expressing too much either in words or looks, recovered his usual cheerfulness, and it was a merry, long- remembered ride to the whole party. "Don't you like hay-making, little boy?" said Anne, turning to Edgar, who had sat from the first perfectly silent, but watching them all intently, with a pleased smile. The large brown eyes went pleadingly up to    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5826-00000021"/> Alfred's face, and a shadow of infinite longing and regret darkened the childish brow. "He is deaf and dumb," said Alfred, in a low tone, as though the lad might hear, and be pained by what he said. "Deaf and dumb!" echoed both the chil- dren, in surprise and pity, Fannie staring at the boy in curious awe, and Anne turning her eyes suddenly away, as though it were sacrilege to be peering into his infirmity. Poor Edgar's eyes grew moist, and he turned away, looking vaguely out towards the sea. "Ah! poor boy," said Margaret, pityingly; "we'll show him good-will, at any rate;" and, getting-up, she went over and took his hand, which she held gently, with an encouraging smile. "Now let us get out, Mr. Alfred; we have ridden as far as we intended; but tell us the boy's name first." "Edgar Percy-Captain Percy's only son." "What! our Captain Percy? Dear, dear! If we only could cure all the sorrow there is in the world! Tell Edgar we all want to be friends with him, and we hope we shall see him again soon."   "I hope, then, that Edgar and I will happen to be together when you meet next-; for we all want to be friends, don't we, Miss Fannie?" said Alfred; but he looked steadily at Margaret, who blushed a little, answering, "Yes, certainly, of course we do." "Oh yes, Mr. Alfred. We always speak to any body in the country. Mamma says we may; but she don't let us when we go back to the city," replied Fannie, innocently. So each party went its way; and while Al- fred thought of Margaret's kindness and sym- pathy for the little mute, the black blood was yet boiling in his heart; for Fannie's childish comment had roused him to unwonted anger. "She's her father's child," he muttered; but when little Edgar began to speak rapidly in sign language, expressing admiration for both Mar- garet and the children, the bright glow of de- light on his sometimes vacant face fell like sun- shine over the murky pool of Alfred's discon- tent, making that radiant also. Heartily in- dorsing the boy's opinion, Alfred concluded to look on the bright side himself-till next time.   CHAPTER X. QUARRELLING AND SIGHT-SEEING.   NOT many days after this Margaret and Al- fred met-for almost the first time since their acquaintance-without the presence of a third party. Who hasn't longed to make a loop-hole in the curtains of fate, and take a peep into the next world? And yet, when the spirit-rappers come, proposing to knock a hole for us right through into the presence of the unseen mysteries, we run away in a chill of dread? Who hasn't want- ed many a thing, and yet, when it was offered him, grew suddenly afraid to touch it even with his little finger? Somewhat so it was with our pair of lovers. Either would have offered a year of life for one hour of peaceful interview, and all the resulting comfort which doubtless would have ensued; and here they stood, unexpected- ly, face to face, by the roadside, shut in by the friendly hills froth every mortal eye. They only stared at each other like two strange cats, every hair bristling up a little in ready defiance. Margaret was going in haste on some errand when she came thus upon Alfred, who was sit- ting on the grassy bank with a handsome brown and green Turbo in his hand, dotted all over at   present with round, gleaming, pearly eyes, which he had introduced expressly for Margaret's grat- ification. He had been filing off the outer sur- face here and there, till he reached the brilliant pearl lining beneath, and had just stopped in his work, highly gratified with the novel effect. "It will be a change, at any rate; and I have two others. Margaret is sure to like it!" He held it sparkling in the sunshine, smil- ing, and half disposed to caress it in Margaret's stead. Suddenly she stood there before him, as if he had evoked her from the unrest of his own wish- es; for he was thinking only of her. She blush- ed, stammered, and hesitated; and the young man, hastily concealing his shell, hesitated, stammered, and blushed, even more than she herself. So, after scarcely a pause, she went rapidly on her way, leaving Alfred gazing after her with a sinking, self-tortured heart. Some conjurers can nestle live coals into the palms of their hands with the coziest comfort; but there are others who would get badly burned even if they were playing with icicles, and the sensible, staid-   going Alfred, in his present state of fermenta- tion, belonged to this latter class, Presently Margaret was seen returning, and the fitful sailor gathered up all his energies for decisive action. I am bound to say that a look of nervous, black desperation seemed to wrap him up as he stood, in a suit of cast-iron armor; and his whole attitude became so wholly martial and defiant, that a stouter heart than Margaret's might have fled in dismay. As she approached, her whole laughing face looked awe-struck, when she recognized this unwonted mood of her ad- mirer. She even thought of Apollyon stopping the way against Christian in the Pilgrim's Prog- ress; laughing a little, and gaining courage at the not very complimentary conceit; but when she came up to his side, her heart was beating again with some undefined terror, and her com- panion was not in a mood to reassure her in the least. "Stay a little, Margaret, and let me speak with you. I have something which I think it very important to say." "IIas the bottom of the sea fallen out, Mr. Alfred? You look exactly as though you had lost your calling. I would stay if I thought that had happened; or that your farm had fall- en into a chasm and been swallowed up; but otherwise I can't, for the whole family are wait- ing for me." "Are they of so much more value than I am?" "Yes; of course. They are five to your one. It takes very little arithmetic to make that clear; don't you see?"Margaret smiled conciliation, and waited. "I see," answered Alfred, moodily. "Well." "Well, can you give me five minutes with a clear conscience towards your employers?" "Hardly. Half of them are already in the carriage, and we are just driving out for the day to the Painted Cliffs." "Go, then!" indignantly. "Well, say it, Alfred! I can run all the way to make up lost time, if necessary." "Margaret, do you really prefer to be trotting after that family like a little dog tied to-them by a long string?" cried the foolish lover, losing all self-control. The blood flushed up angrily over Margaret's face. "The string is a long one which binds me to them," she said in low, concentrated tones. "Good-morning!" "Good - morning, and good - bye. You go, then, deliberately?" "Of course." Alfred had forgotten that he really had not   60 THEY PARTEI). asked the question he had intended, and Mar- garet's cutting indignation of words and man- ner seemed to him at the moment like an an- swer. He had meant to inquire whether or not it was with her approval that he had been sent away from the house so curtly and decis- ively when he had called a few days before; but instead of that he had blundered into an unintentional insult, which Margaret's quick blood had promptly and hotly resented. So they parted; she hurrying on, leaving him, at first, standing there in the road, and then slowly following, still keeping her in sight, as she would otherwise have disappeared over the hill. Five minutes afterwards he saw her step into a carriage. The whole family drove off in bright colors, with a showy, handsome turnout, and at a festival rate, which completed his indignation. "Bah! She'd rather be a foot-ball in that family than to manage the helm of my boat, that's certain. Now I've done with herl"The unlucky fellow struggled resolutely to tear all thought of her forever out of his heart. "I've done with her Let her be a shuttlecock to the end of the chapter. She likes it! I'm a fool, that's certain; but I can keep my own counsel, and thrive on it." As for Margaret, she had not taken twenty steps before she saw clearly that she had ac- cepted an insult, though none had been offered by her hot-headed admirer, who, in his present mood, was simply beside himself, and that was all. 'She half wanted to turn back, but was    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5826-00000022"/> too proud for that, and was a, good deal indig- nant still, even at such unconscious impudence. II Why couldn't he have said it at once, what- ever it was, an d have done with it!" she thought, testily. "It wasn't to ask me tomarry him out- right, as I thought it was at first, but it was some- thing which he thinks important. I am afraid somebody is meddling, and yet Ir don't see hOiy, " By this time she had reached the carriage, and, once seated, there, was leisure for more thought; though every body chattedl about ber in the sunniest of morning moods. Her pres- ent temper was by no means a sunny one, for' she was about equally vexed wi th herself and with Alfred. 'Why, Margaret, did you breakfast on ]cm- on-juice?3" asked Frank, as she set with her face turned awaya3, and not only entirely silent, but evidently uninterested in aill that was going. on. 6'You went in too -much haste, Margaret," said Mrs. Warner, kindly. "Don't do it an- other time ; a few minutes' longer waiting would not have mattered to us, and you looked tiredc and flushed." "(I was in too much baste," answered Mar- gacret, quietly. After that the chatting and the girl's troubled thoughts both went on together again. "Somebody said, father, that a great savant visited these Painted Cliffs some thirty years ago, and lie announced to the world that they were extremely interesting and magnificent; but that, in order to get there, he had to let down seven. teen different pairs of bars." II Capital I liow expert you will 'become then, Fratnk, in the art of jumping in and out of the carriage." ,1 He'll learn to put up bars as nicely as any cow-boy, won't lie, palpa?" "I wish Hhadn't flared up suddenly, like a smutty lamp, at the first breath of wind," thought Margaret. "Ali, now, isn't this pretty?" called Mrs. Warner. "It's fine, very fine! Anclear pond ofwmater on both sides of the road; and these Ilills are  full of character, and suit; the location, 7 said the elder gentleman, patronizingly. "Whenl I see him again I'll put away pride, and make it right. The poor boy deserves it, for he is not happy. And there is blame somne- where, too; but I'm sure it isn't with him, though his temper is as hot as a red pepper, apparently.. I don't mind, through. If one was used to it, and could get it soothed with the milk of real loving kindness, it wouldn't   matter at all. I'm in scalding mVater balf the time as it is, and always have been. Besirles, something is wrong and unnatural. That I've felt'for a long time, and he is sufferin g for it. So I'll do my best to make it up when we meet again, or at any rate to get to the bottom of it." With this good resolution 1Margaret thrust away her troubled thoughts, determined to en. joy a, pleasant holiday. She smiled once to herself as she thought that Alfred would be sure to turn up ,-somewhere soon, and give her the necessary opportunity; for in her heart she wats almost as certain of his constancy as she was of following her own shadow Nyhen she went down to the ocean at eventide and it was a clear sunset. The one and th-e other bad been almost equanlly unfailing- ever since she came to the sea-side. I'Aha, Framnk! not bars -now, but a gate!" laughed Mr. Warner, as tthe road seemedi to be suddenly cut off by an obstruction ; which, bow-, ever, is not at all unusual in these parts, where all. side-roads seem to be private property. "That's a modern improvement, then! In- another thirty years, I suppose, it will really be ai public higehway," said the lady. I'Aha, father! no jumping this time, though i Don't you see? Here's a new luxury coming.", A child, with aI mat of curled, woolly bair, and a smiling brown face, swung open the wide gate and stood holding 'it for them to drlive through. H-er little bare, dark feet and bands were as nearly the color 6f the red man as of the black; and she was in reality? of mixed blood-a1 little, slip of Indian ancestry grafted into the Africo-American tree--thoughi her people, who were settled in the region, were called Painted Cliff Inldians, and, like other Indians, had been, till recently,, exempt from tarxation. II Here are pennies," said Frank, II and thank you. Open it again when we come back, by- and-by, little girl." "'There! I want to giveaapenny too," said Fannie, handing one to the child, whose shiningi face brightened wonderfully ait this unexpected donation. "Cn you read, little girl?" asked Mrs r Warner. "Yes, ma'am; i Im in the I Second Reader." So this little slip of dark-blooded humanity was not a savage, but a schoolgirl; and a sensible enough, and not -over-dirty, merry little thing she looked. "Can you sew, and wipe dishes, and hoe corn, besides?" asked Frarnk, laughing, and im- itatingl his mother's tone ever so little.   (I Yes, sir, and pick up potatoes 77 retorted the ctlild, with a suppressed giggle, twinkling two inipish eyes, which were neither Indian nor African. After this, they drove over abominathle roads, or off on the grassy sides, which were smoother than the dreadful ruts in the sand, finding ev. cryr thing delightfully rural, till they bad girad-- tially? -Iisen to the top of a magnificent high plaill, still knobby, however, with the old-time sand-d-crifts, now covered with their green gar- inents of short grass and whortleberries.  Here qni alt-ost, unrivalled view burst upon them like a sudden wonder. There was ocean on three slides with banks and wooded hills across the gleazming water in one direction, the inlterven- ing space literally covered with whtite -winged AipIs, on their passage to and fro along the great Atlantic Iligrhway. A little Indian church, and Indiann country homes, inoculated with civiliza. tion, yet hanging still upon the- skirts of thewil- decrness, were in the background; and the Gov- ernment li,,ht-house lifted up its stately warning fingecr froln the outermost land-point in front. There was a suppressed murmur, and yet no one spoke. The horses were brought to a halt, anid the cliildren stood up in the carriage-ecv- cryv face radiating back again the light of beauty Avhiih was falling upon it in full measure. The invalid had forgotten his often infirmities-trans- p'orted out of himself into a frame of mind wor- tliv to be one of the beatitudes. If Captain Gilers could hanve seen him now, he might have dliscovered the secret of a radical cure for his alilments; for the interest which a fishing ex- carsion would inevitably fail to awaken was now in fervid and cheerful action. Cc Better than we bargained for!" said Frank, at lencahh drawing a long breath. 'L It's like solid gold, when you expected, onlly gold-wash; isn't it mother?" 'It certainly is very, very? fine." Thle cloud-sliadlows exactly suit the land- scape, and seem to belong to it. It is a bless- ing that the sunshine is not unfailing, otherwise we sliould only half enjoy the more perfect mo- nients like this, said Mr. Warner, tak ing off his hiat, and looking about him with a placid be- Iiiinity. Thaht means we are to stop here for lunch, s suppose, father?" "Yes. Yes, my son; we couldn't do, bet- ter.71 There was a sudden scrambling out of the carrinege by all the younger members of the party; and Frank, who was driver, began to be concerned for his horses, jfor there was not -a    tree or fence in tire neighborhood to which he could fasten them. He soon settled the matter by tying them to tire carriage itself, where his fatther and mother preferred to remain seated. "rank! Frank! do you know that man sitting up there at tire very highest point under the liberty-pole?" called Annec, running back to ber brother in some trepidation. i ' Make him go away, Frank! we want that place ourselves; and lie's got a gun," said Fan- nie. If it's a liberty-pole, then lie's at liberty to sit under it, if he wants to, I suppose, Faii but I'll give him a poke under the ribs, if you like. Lend me your darning-needle, and I'll put a few stitches in his neck, M4argaret. That may enable )lim to sit up, at least." I IIan hebcetipsy, Mr, Frank? Thatntwould Spoil the picnic for Your falther and mother. Perhaps it's one of the Indians." "Blescs you! no. It's Mr. Dennis; and it isn't a gun, but a telescope. Thant's not amiss, for I was just wanting one ; so don't be troubled, for I'll cntertarin him children. You'll find lie's oa better man in a desert like tliis than a court- jester would be at Court. It's half an hour yet to lunch, and if he stays wec'll give hlim a sandwich.") Mr. Dennis suddenly flopped over, and then sat upright, staring at the company in some astonishment.  IIAsleep, by George t Well, I U'lieve I had dozed off!" lie said, nodding to Frank, and making a general bow to the others, without rising.  II Gad to meet you, Mr. Decnnis. Here's a field worthy of your telescope." w ell, yes. I come up to spy about. This thing kinder makes neighbors for you in dull times; helps you to board any ship you fancy, and scrape acquaintance without a grain 01 trouble." "It's as, good as it magic wisbing-car you  see, Fannie; if not inatlcr better up here, where there is something to be seen." "There isn't muclito see to-day ; but Icauglit. sight of something floating, and it went out of eye-shot fro 'm my house, rand so I come on up here to get a clear vicNV; but Kier Williams, be put out and brougllt it in--a set of boxes swim. ming about, it appeared to be, cast over from' some ship; but; whatever it was, I've lost it, and that's generally my luck. I saw him just a hauling;'cm into his boat as I got up here. Kier wasn't one born with a silver spoon in bit; mouth, but he was born to pick up all the dropped shil- lings which any body else loses. He picks up an amazing deal from wrecked ships, and ono    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5826-00000023"/> way and another, out of the sea and off of the hand." "He's the-early bird, I suppose?" "Well, yes; but 'taint that altogether. If a dozen men went down to draw sea-weed, the others might not get a full load; but he would. Seems kinder as if the stuff would come tum- bling up at his feet. if he wanted it, just to be obliging, you know. He and I often went ber- rying when we were boys together, and if all sorts of little wild fruits didn't just flush up and ripen for him on purpose: then I'm certain that they must have helped pick themselves at the very least, for he always bad his basket more than twice as full as any one of the rest of us; and when we've been a-gunning along shore, I declare I've seen little birds bob right up before him, and sing out, "Kill dear! kill dear!" in a way just kind and knowing like, as if they really meant it; and when lie did kill 'cm, they'd just topple over in such a peaceful and resigned way, it was a sight to behold." Mr. Dennis looked furtively out from under his busby eyebrows watching the effect of his words; but to the children his face looked dreamy'and half asleep, and they were both in- clined to think him a little daft or crazed. Poor Anne started nervously when lie turned to her and said, with unusual earnestness, in a tone of sincere conviction You mayn't think it, Miss, but it's really so. You see that's his gift! That's his gift!" "Why, Dennis," interposed Frank, "you must belong to the age of poetry and marvels. It seems very certain to me now that this island is a suburb of the real wonder-land. It looks like it just here, at any rate."He said this gravely, with a quizzical glance towards Mar- garet, and a prolonged, admiring look over the rather eerie landscape. 1-1 The ghosts of the old aboriginal'Indians must be stalking about here, I dare say; and over there in the cliffs I hear that one can still find bones of the primitive mermaids and their fishy first cousins." "More fact than fancy, young gentleman," responded Mr. Dennis, with preternatural seri- ousness. " Whoever says that the old lndians don't walk hereabouts, had better prove it; that's all. If a man had tended a flower-garden all his life, itstands to reason be would Uke to come back and see how it got on afterwards. The original red men used to like this hill, there- ain't a doubt of it; and if they are alive, it don't do to say positive, you know, that they've all turned their backs on it, )cause maybe they haven't. As for mermaids ) H don't say about them; but if a fish is alive, it is alive like ev.   ery thing else, and whether In the body or out of the body, it don't matter. It's'pretty certain that there isn't any life now in the fossils out. L yonder; and it's a little more certain still that there is life here,." With his long thumb and finger he pointed downward, thoughtfully nipping off spire after O       n spire of the stubby short grass at his elbow. This will be dead bay 'to-morrow; but you see I can't pinch out the life. That will go somewhere; won't it?" "It would seem so, Mr. Dennis," replied Frank, slowly. "Of course. You c an find curious dead things over there, from little stone quabaugs and camped up mouthfuls of crabs, along with the real teeth of monsters that very likely might a done it, up to the spine-bones of sea-creatures, every jint 'of 'em, big enough for the ]lead of a wooden mallet. They are all preserved."' Do you mean it, really, Mr. Dennis?" ask. ed Annetimidly. "Yes really, miss, really. , Just you ask the lighthouse keeper to show you some-if seeing is believing. You see Providence wa'nt R-going to let all the old juicy past go on and dry up into nothing, and He just contrived it so that a good many things got hardened somehow into stone, and a good many more got preserved- like, mostly in a natural state, or, at least, about as much so as dried apples are like green ones. Round here He used a kind of sirup of iron, I take it, or something of that sort, for keeping a good many things; and He used it pretty much as my sister Jedida does molasses for the more common ind of preserves. The white-sugar relics are a little choicer class- I suppose. You see this island is one of his general store-houses, and things are packed away here done tip most- ly in heaps of clay and sand-something like the way they store grapes in bran and saw-dust, to preserve'em, for winter. It's all curious enough, and a great many things are curious. I tell you, Providence keeps all the ends up even, and He never lets go of a single thread or ravelling, or drops any stitches, or allows a shred of any i thing that He takes iri hand to go to real waste. Some folks are ashamed of economy; but the Almighty, lie isn't!" The little group had gathered about the lounging Historian and moralizer, listening in amused astonishment-shaded by a solemn awe in the minds of the children, who watched the ceaseless movement of the long thumb and fin- -ger, which seemed to be, plucking away bit by bit from a great mine of mysteries 'hidden be- neath their very feet.   "It ain't likely that the live part of this lit- fle, creature here that enjoys to eat- and jump, and struggles, and wants to spring away from me now, is going to perish out and out, is it? Look there2 now; aw he goes, and lie gets comfort out of it. His life's worth having, if He is a, grasshopper!" The, man had made a sudden lunge to seize the insect, and nov he extended his open palm towards it with a wave of dismissal and bene- diction.  There he goes out of sight, but not out of existence - and it will be just the same when he jumps clean out of his body into-the grasshopper's future state. Shouldn't you say so?" lie asked, appealing to Margraret, "I am almost tempted to believe it," she re- plied, seriously. I hope so," laughed Frank. Oli! I wish every little thing like that could live forever, " said Anne, sympathetically. Mosquitoes and all?" added Frank. Maybe they could get enough to eat there, and wouldn't bite us, 7) said Mr. Dennis, with the sidelong glance of scrutiny from his half- shut eye. III suppose we should have mighty little blood to draw from, at any rate." II Like enough," said Frank, dryly. Here Fannie giggled, and every body's feel- ings were perceptibly lightened. "To come back to Kier'Williarns, " said Mr. Donn"is. "It's reasonable to conclude that lie was just made with a special gift, as I said be- fore. So,' maybe, we all are. I think so, be- yond a doubt; but his lies more on the surface maybe, and it's a kind of profitable gift to the nian himself, now isn't it?" he continued, look. "ig up with a cheerful and approving smile, like a man not disinclined to patronize even the, Providence whose wonderful power he was always so fond of applauding. Kier Williams is a man that I could almost envy, but not quite." "If I lived neighbor to such a man I should claim him for first cousin," laughed Margaret. &amp; 4Would you, miss?" said Mr. Dennis, ad- miringly. 44I never thought of that, but I shouldn't wonder if it would pay;" and, with a smile of great good-will, the long figure which had been sprawling over the grass allthis time stumbled up to its feet, poking the telescope at Margaret with empressement. , "Take it and try it; you won't have to buy it." II Thank you. We'll let the youngest begin tolookfirstthen. NowFanniel" KSO they looked, each in turn, with eminent satisfaction, highly entertained, meantime, by the remark s- of Mr. Dennis.   Frank carried the great supplemental eye to his parents, but neither of them would consent to use it. "The view is wide enough, my son," said his father, positively. "I don't care to try it, dear," said his mother. 'Do get the man away, Frank, if you can; he spoils every thing!" So Frank started back with a wry face, but came into thepresence smiling from ear to car. Mr. Dennis, when you go fishing again couldn't von take me as mate, in the place of that small Maybough. Then lie can go on hoeing, and I'll do half the rowing. It seems you always have to entice him from his father's garden; but I'm off like thistle-down at the smallest notice, and no one the worse for it." "Certain I it's just the thing. - I'd go to. morrow 2 but I can't to my sorrow." why not?" Well, I've got some hay to draw, and some wood to saw." Do that to-day, can't you Yes, so I might, so I might, and so I will; but I must be off at once, if I do. Good-day, all!" sidling off, with a sweeping nod. "I'll be along past your house, young man, about eight o'clock, looking for you." "So that's settled. I was afraid hewould stick like a bur and prick my fingers, for mother wanted I should pull him off. For my part, I -shan't mind wearing him as a bosom-pin all to- morrow, for lie's entertaining." II Mother is waving us back, and 'it's lunch- time," said Anne, running on before, and climb- ing into the carriage. The whole family were -soon seated again, partaking of as dainty a cold lunch as Margaret couldprepare-allivitlisea-airappetites. Mean- time the horses nibbled their oats under the same invigorating influences, and all feeling the fresher for their repast drove on with re- newed interest in the scenes yet to be visited. The sun was shining brilliantly down up-on the Painted Cliffs when they reached them, lighting up their many colors with a marvel- lous beauty. These cliffs are composed of plastic clay and sand of almost every bue- from 'inky black to a dazzling white. There are whole slopes colored blood red chocolate 7 or yellow, or gray, and still others with a mix- ture of several of these-the whole rising up from the sea like a great rainbow, stretching away a mile or two in length, and some hun- dred and fifty feet in height. Our holiday party stood upon the crest of these bluffs, looking down upon the vivid color-    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5826-00000024"/> ing below and off upon .the ever restless, match- less ocean, with its green islands, feeling im- mensely more than rernnnerated for, all possible fatigue. Mr. Warner cared very little either for the ugly fossils displayed by the lighthouse keeper, or for the beautiful Fresnel lamp which is the crown and glory-of the light-house itself, and which once added a wonderful brilliancy even to the great Exposition at Paris. T ihis remarkable lamp has both a constitution and a historyy, for it is six-hundred-sided, of a marvel- lous, complicated beauty, and it has been twice I'urchalsedi by the Government from some of the shrewd Labans of commerce, as REachel was twice won by Jacob, and it is prized accord- ingly. While the others were examining this miracle of science and art, Mr. Warner, in- order to best enjoy the scenery, sat so far out upon the edge of the bank that lie was in im- minent danger of going down with one of the, frequent land slips which aire so continually changing the whole face of the cliff. He had forgotten weakness aind pain; and, when he had enjoyed this view long enough, was as ready as the gavest or youngest of them all to scramble down the steep path to thfe shore und look up at the wondlrous coloring from be- low. The attention of the children was espe- cially arrested by the iron conglomerates which abound here. 'Hydrate of iron, in noduless of all sizes and shanpes, generally filled with clay or sand, which would fidil out, leaving a hollow ba- sin, enchanted them, and they ran about hunt- ing for -fatnciful iron cups in the greatest glee. Numbers of these bad fallen out of the cliffs and been tossed to and fro by the waves,- which had simoothed-arnd rounded them as it does the peb- bles upon the beach. Quiet little Anne found one wave-polished goblet not much thicker than ordinary glass, a prettily shaped oval, capable of Ilolding more tlilan a pint of liquid. This she filled with sea-   water, colored with the bright pigments whiell hard fallen from the cliffs, till it, was not unlike a rich, darik wine, and brought it to her father, who held it in his hand admiring, laughing, and even sipping like a great, boy in a frolic; and then F'rank began to batter the immense nodu- lar masses which lay about, el dipping off dozens of little rough, striking forms', generally reddish brown in color, but some of them almost black, and others striped with yellow ochre, or orna- mented with shining pebbles. The water, even a good way out to sea, was rosy with the dissolv- ing colors which had washed into it; for in yes. terday's storm, the waves had laid hands on the cliffs, and carved them into new lines of beauty., and both were still flushed and glowing after all this excitement. Loaded with treasures, the Warners, returned home, all still in the best of spirits, and ready for supper. Margaret, whobhad greatly enjoyed the day with the rest, began expediitiously to pre-- pare the tea, thinking of Alfred as she worked, with a smile always at her heart, sometimes ris- ing till it dimpled either check. She had filly persuaded herself that the morning's little mis- understanding would be speedily blown away like a passing cloud, and this thought was higih. ly satisfactory. She had just made the tea and taken it in, when she returned to find a package, addressed to herself, lying upon tlte wood-box in the porch. Her heart beat as she opened it, yet the smile deepened aind spread over her whole face while she slowly untied the string. Then a great blank weariness fell over her, and all the light went out of her eye and out of her heart. The paper contained white lin- en, and a slip of paper was pinned to it with these words: "To Miss.3fargaret Nelson. ?, ,eturn 'your hIandkerchief." So thecn it was all over.   CHAPTER Xi. MORNING AND; AFTSERNOON.   ANhNE WtARNEER  was a child whom people called "old-fashioned," possibly because she laidc learned self-sacrifice by the easy-chalirs of two invalids. While Frank was away at busi- niess, Mafrgaret occupied with her manifold du- ties, -and Fannie skipping fromn attic to cellar, ,and sornctimes over the pavements outside, Anne sat reading the newspaper aloud to her fiather, or daintily sewing at the side of lier mother, ready, any moment, either to light her fatherl's cigarr or to carry a message for lier mother to one of the servants. She quite liked these deities, and considered them as plrivileges I'ather th -an privations ; for she bad listened to their grown-tip conversation till her busy little braiiil seemed to have grown tip also in sympa. tliy with her surroundings. It was not strange, thelrefore, that the, child should hatve felt an iin- nionse attraction for the contented, motherly little Mrs. Giles, and that one of her greatest pleastires at the sea-side should consist in spend- ill- an hounr or two almost every day with tile Iice, chatty old lady, who petted her as a child, land talkedc to her as a woman. She was there sometimes before the morning wdrrk was finished, and then she glided quietly aIbout on tiptoe, looking on, with thoughtful in- torest, at the polishing of knives or the pickling of delicate young onions; or she stood at one side of the bedI delighted to turn over the sheets -read blankects in the same deft and cle4Er way that the old lady did at the daily bed-making. Mrs. Giles's dark , shining blue dishes were a9n immense luxury in Anne's eyes, and a slip (if pie eaten from one of these glorifie'd plates, or a sip of milk drawn up from the blue depths of a small ten-cup, were more acceptable to her than when taken from her mother's best gilt and white china at the Boston home; yet it is "1,Yht. to say thiat the milk was neither blue nor chalky, and the Pic always intrinsically pala-'  table. "Frantk tells me, Mrs. Giles, that I am wear-  ill, out my Ivelcome, and that I should be on    the look-out for the patches which you must be obliged to sew ill now every time I come here." "Tell him, then, dear, that your welcome is alive, and growing more and more thrifty every day. It is a green plant which puts out a bright new leaf at everv visit."The old dame looked so thoroug6lly  satisfied with her visitor that Anne fclt no misgiving. "I like so much to hear about your grand. 71lrn" h ad  "Will you let me look clt all their daguenrreotypes again? I shanll caree more to see them, now that I know somecthingi about them, and what kind of people they are." Is O, yes; bring them all otit,'audi all their fathers alld mothers, and we'll )lave a good look into their faces once more. I always feel as if I hadr had a houseful of company after I have looked at 'cm all a good while, and given each of the babies a kiss---the darlings! I shall always love the babies the best." "So do 1, Mrs. Giles. Baby-pictures are a great deal sweeter than grown-tip ones." "That's so; and you are a real little woman." I hope Tootm  and Midget will come, Mrs. Giles; for I ttlink you ought to have Some Of your grandchildren all the time; 'and then this is such a nice place to be." "Cap'tingi Giles expccts 'cm confidently by next week; and it's not often they disappoint him when his heart- is set on a visit. Lay all the pictures in my workbasket, and first come uji with me and see how I've got their room fixed already." The old lady- and the child climbed the stairs hand in hand, and stood together in the visitors' room admiringly.  The bed was covere d with a delicately-colored patchwork quilt, and the little old-fashioned bureau and wash-statnd with white dimity spreads, hung with curiously -knotted fringe, matching the white-fringed curtains at the windows. This old-time fringe was Mrs. Giles's own hazndiwork in the days of her maid- enhood, and prized accordingly by herself and    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5826-00000025"/> her descendants; so that to bring out this choice a- fringed drapery was to do the highest honor to m herguests. Grandchildren were becoming more A and more precious every year in the eyes 6if the o warm-hearted grandmother, and she bad bright- " ened and beautified the room with a new glow b of loving sunshine, warming and freshening her not yet withered old heart.         c There was a little chair for Midget, and a b grown-up chair for Toturn, besides a great easy- t' chair for a visitor. The little table, with its o black and crimson cloth, was brightened with I1 six new books; three grown-up ones, with bril-  liant covers, for Totum, and three little ones, r with gay pictures, for Midget; and there was a  small china vase, to be filled with f-lowers by Midget; and a larger colored-glass vase, to be used for the same purpose by her sister.  The grandmotherly  eyes glistened, and she i wiped away a tear or two as she looked; though I the eyes were sunny and smiling all the time, even when the tears dropped from them. Anne  felt in stinctively that-the whole atnlosphclre waste laden with loving kindness. Slhe was quite used to handsome apartments, expensivelyv fit- ted up for the trse of young girls; yet this one suited her, and made her put her hands softly  together, and say, almost under her breathe "It is all so nice and so -retty!" "Their grandpa brouglit home the books yes. terdayl, and he's writ their names already, I think ; for he was busy with pen and ink. just before you came." Anne went over to the table alnd read-the old lady looking over her shtoulder--"Tutunth Giles,froynn Grandpaz Totunt." "Bless the man! be gave her that name, and now lie's taken it hiitself." "I: think it's so nice! I should like to be called almost any thing besides Anne," slowly taking tip another book, and reading, 94 I Mis 1fary Giles, fronL Grandmla Giles.' Mary is a sweet name, though; but I want to call her TSotum-if she lets me." II Oh dear I yes. She 's full of frolic, like her grandfather, and will let you call her any thing." 'mL1iss Mary Gilesffront the Alfarines' Lodye; in anticipation of a gtrandpat l. Now what will the others say, I wonder? - Wiiss Helen Giles,firont grandmasa Read and learn.-Afiss Helen Giles, front Grandpa. Live and learn.- JMidget,front the great swing in tire bdrnm.' I like thein all; don't'you, Mrs. Giles?" "(Just like him," said the old wife, brushing away the tear and smile -which were struggling together in her eye. II Hoow nice it must be to have a grandfather   and a grandmother, and a house to visit at which is just another horne for holidays," said Annd, who had few relatives of any kind, good or bad. "All this seems so pleasant;, and now, when I see the room, I feel sure they'll come; but before I couldn't realize it.'2 Then the two went down together, and had a cozy time over the dagiuerreotypes, with a brief biography uf each original, by way of refreshing the memory; for the dear old lady liked to talk of 41 her numerous posterity," and 'the young girl liked equally well to hear. She knew all the Giles kinsfolk, near and remote, aind could have made out a pretty accurate list of names and ages. "Just what kind of a girl is Totum, Mrs.  Giles V" site asked, looking intently at her pie- turec. Tell me something that will make me understand her--somnething about her ways, you know, and wPhat she likes." She is always good-natured, and rcady to take part in every thing I am doing--juAt as though her heart was in it--when of course, it can't be; and I never saw the time When she wasn't ready for ae joke or a froOlic. It's like a steady summer breeze to have her going in and rout about the lousee" "You'll enjoy: that, won't you?" 'I always do. Some of my other gfannd- - Clildren1 are as different as the northl and south I winds.') t "Is I ittfe Midget like her? "No, dear; not a grain. She is entirely e another pattern, and put together dtiffclrent everyv n way. It's curious; but the two sisters are no molre alike than a full damask rose and a sweet- brier. - Midget will go round like a little queer old womnan--somnetimes not speaking for half can hour; and you can see she is thinking- away, yand enjoying something all by hclrself; and an- s other time she'll ask questions and questions, * as odd and serious ats can be. Whlen she gets * on anv thing, she can't see any other till that's done with. Capting Giles says that Midget al- x ways strips all her currant-bushes, off clean as "she goes." 4 ' Is she as good-natured as Totum?" Lt 94 Why, she don't seem to understand a joke, ,n or to- care for it; and when her grandfather gets Rs into one of his merry turns, she'll open her eyes as wide and wondering as if she couldn't make ,e him out at all. That pleases himt amazingly. He laugfils over her sometimes till the whole ig sofa under him shakes as if it had gone into a Ig fit of the ague; and between the two, I'm never in danger of dyspepsia." "r The old lady wiped her eyes, which: were drip-   ping over with pleasant reminiscences-laugh- ing as she thought over the past, till she quiver- ed from head to foot like the old gentleman's sofil, or like a placid mound of disturbed gela- tine. Suddenly she checked herself, when she saw Annec's eyes opening rather wide with a look of repressed a -stonishment and inquiry. IIIt's nothing, my dear; I w-as thinking of one dayy fist before the child went home last. Midget is a nice little thing; and, on the whole, I tliink Ave find her rather mo0re entertaining than any c(f the others. She does me as nitich. good as ttiking a strong cup of a new kind. of tea ; and I ,ilravs like to have her here as well as any of mny grandchildren." "I am ,almost sure I shall like them both, 7 said the cliild, slowly and reflectively. "I amM quite sure they Nvilli both like you," was this. Giles's grandmotherly thouglit as slie looked overlit her young visitor affectionately-- smilinfr, but not speaking. After a while they drifted off into local gossip. "Is it possible! DIid you. -never see beach- p'lumns, dear child? They are very nice, and makec excellent preserves. You will Ilave a few on your place ; but there a7re not many just abotit helre. Thehy grow mostly in the Paninted Cliffnecighthorhood, and alre not nearly as abin dannt as they used to be. T"Q Indians don't like white folks to pick 'em; thotigh some -of theni say they don't applove of forbidding any body to gather a handfiul of wild plums; and old Sally WTilliams says shec'thinks the Lord don't approve of such close deazlings, and lie makces the beach-plums get searcer and scalrcer." The Indians sell theni, I suppose?" "Yes; and all kinds of wild berries and grapes; and so, as they grow mostly on their reserves I suppose they have the best rigdit to them. And then, dear me! there are plenty of. blackberries almost everywhere, when peo- plec will let them grow, and huckleberries and 9rapes. You can get 'cm by the bushel if you "Io over to the 'vykobskie neighborhood; and everyv -body may pick who likes. There it's first come, first served." "But don't they belong to any one in partic- ular 3 "The land belongs to some one; but the wild fruit isn't cultivated, and people gather it I:is they gather nuts in the. woods; but the In- dianss don't always allow it on their grounds.

"What a funny custom! I should like to see them all picking, with their brown faces, and their great baskets of red and white cratn- berries." IISome of the people--bogys especially-pay them off, though; for while the Indians are away after cranberries, they can't watch the grapes, aind so the boys load thehil baskets from the wildi vines." "The Indiatns should gather the grapes be- -forehatnd!" "So- they do a great deal, but there are so many; and they don't all ripen in time to gath- er in early." "I rode in the stage the other day, Mrs. Giles, with two Indian girls, whoo were dressed as nice. ly as any one, and they talked as well as we do. One of them was almost white, with a long Ro- mann nose, crooked like a hawk's bill." IIYes; some of 'cm appear as pretty as any girl&amp;a on the island; but some can't be trusted quite like our people, for all. Why, Anne, dear, there's Capting Giles coming; and'I de- clare I've forgotten dinner!" and Mrs. Giles bustled into the porchr to prepare her vegetables while Annc waited to see the captain. "Why! well, is this the little peaked-faced girl who came out from Boston about a month a(,o? I declare, pretty soon you'll look like a squirrel with six nuts in each check!"This was the old captain's greeting to the small maiden who stood up rosy and smiling as he entered; and then lie took her hand in both his own, looking down at her wittl a grandfatherly kindness. III declare, I almost wish you were another of my granddaughters, and I guess Miss Giles quite wishes it. You've won her heart out and out; and I'm more obliged to you than you know, little one, for brightening up her old, days a bit." CrOh , it's she who brightens my days. She never is in need of any thing more than she has, I think." "Thatt's just about hitting the nail on the head, child. Sh'e would go on smiling and comrortrble on a dry crust, with a deluge pour. ing down overhead; but, for all that, you've brought her a ivorld of comfort, too, and we both know it. Where's your brother Frank to. day VP Gone fishing with Mr. Dennis, -captain." 'Has? W6111 like that.  The boy's come out for a summer's holiday, and he means to get his money's worth."  II Yes, sir, ) said Anne, a keen sense of hu.-    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5826-00000026"/> mor gleaming out suddenly from her childish face. She had been looking up, with an admir- ing fascination, into the old sailor's kindly eyes;; for if she was very fond of Mrs. Giles, she found the captain a perpetual source of wonder and entertainment quite unfathomable. Their in- terest in each, other was mutual. Captain Giles saw the brightening of the little thoughtful face, and tiis heart was touched. 'Her poor little life hlas been a deal too quiet and urdned" he said to himself, as he looked. "WeV must contrive to let in more sea-breezes there also. I can't bear to see any young thingl frost-bitten in the bud." He went on talking and watching the effect of his laughing words and tones upon the appre- ciattive child wittl a tender solicitude, for -the captain was constitutionally a 'enerous busy- body in other people's affairs.. His zeatl might sometimes have outrun his discretion but for the perpetual loving check of his bclear-sigibhted wife. "Your brother has already taken a right. hand grip on most of our land! doings, and lie takes to the water like a fish. It gives me a new relish evelry, day'for my victuals just to watctl him; a2nd I expect that to look on and see him enjoy it will do me more good thann qurartsi of mustard or grated horse-radish, caten with my summer's meat." "Yes s ir" added Anne, still smiling and happy; "he says he feels as though he hadd just got out of jail,- where lie Iias been shut up all his life." "Well, only wait ti 11 my granddaughters come, and then we are all going into m'erry- making fks a steady diet. You children are all invited to share our pot-luck, and it will-be a wonder if We don't -enjoy some delightful chow- ders. Shall you like it?" "Oh yes, Captain Giles, I am sure we shall." "You see, dear, I am anxious to put a new snapper on to the end of my own life. An old whip that won't crack isn't really worth much, 2 continued the captain. At this moment the little deaf mute, Edgar Percy, stood in the door-way, and the girl's'E face? at once losing its -smiles, explressed ftipmnd- liness and compassion as site came forward and took the boy's hand, leading him in with a ges,- ture of welcome. The two children were of about the same age, both just at the threshold of their teens; yet the infirmity of the boy made him 'seem much younger find more de- pendent than his companion, who treated him something as a mother mib'ht have treated an   ailing child, taking his bat out of his hand, and seating him in an easy-chair, rather against his will. Captain Giles's welcome of his little rel- ative was as cordial as his own sunny nature required, the delighted old man acting as intei-- preter while the two children conversed. "I am going to school. I am going away next week," said Edgar, at length, his eye dinil- minig a little at the thought. "It's decided then, is itP" answered the cap- tain.  Wecll, be brave and bear it, my boy! It's for the best;" and then he repeated the news to Anne, who looked both surprised andi piteously sympathetic I  TZell hini I am so sorry, Captain Giles." 'He knows that already, little puss. You have told him yourself. - But it is best thlat Edgar should be educated; and so, you see, lie must go away to school." "But it will be so bard for him to part with Iis father and mother, and go among strangers." I IYes, missy ; bu t he in u A learn to be a , ma n all the same.- Can you - se that large boy out there on the hany-eart in the meadow? NNell? he'is sixteen, to be sure; but lie and another boy of about the same age are going off to sca next Saturday, to be gone for at least six monflis without 't once hearing from ]iomec  That's his old father patching up the hay, and he has sent seven sons, one after another, off to sea, anc\ this is his very last boy. An -older one sailecl onlly: two weeks ago for Greenland, expecting to be gone for three years. Edgar can get news from home every weekr or two, and conic back if any thing is amiss." "Yes, but it's all so sad. I don't lilce part- -ings; and I pity the boy out there, and his old father and his mother. I: suppose Edgar should\ go; but it's very hard, all1 the same, and I shall think of -him off there alone a great many times. Tell him so, please, Captain Giles." The lad's face brightened when be under- stood the message, and in the first home-sick- ness of the school-days lie would be certain to remember it. When Mrs. Giles learned that Edganr was going from bome so soon, she first kissed hini heartily, wtiping: away a tear, and then hurrietl out, returning directly, loaded with doughnuts, which she pressedi upon everyv body, and which they all declined ; but afterwards they each took one and ate it for good-fellowship's sake-the kind old captain chatting and making merry, to banish the Shadow which had fallen upon -his young -visitors.   CHAPTER XIL . MIDGET7S MORNING CALL.   MARGAREnT had grown almost as moody andI distartled in heart as Aclfred. In all America slice had no killdred, and there were none nearer to her thzan lialf-forgotten uncles and cousins, even in the Old Wolrld; shle sorely missed the ready sympathy of this sailor-falrmer, who had certainly shown her, time and again, that she was-s in all his thoughts, till her waitingJ heart Iiiatl gone out to him as to a Haven of rest.

Even thr!  counterpane is a little awrly. Don't you see ]low the figure is over on one side?" MaIrgarett went on righting every thing as its shortcomings were brought to light, her face  calni and forbearing; but the old blrightness was wanting, and the pleasant repartee, which "Imays abundantthy repaid Mrs. Warner for any I Small Mmissions or commissions, seemed to fail lier utterly. "Now, Mamrgaret, continued the lady, still -more plaintively rryon are not going t6i take on   t the air of a martyr because I happeMn to noticoi these little thillgs. You know they always will annoy me if I am not well." "Oh dcar! Yes, ma'am I1 know, said the girl, withreacdy compunction. 111didn't mean any thing of the kind. I ani not a bit troubled at your speaklingi; but ttlis shabby little room seems so scanty every way, that I am like the poor old woman who kept twitching first; at one corner of her table-cloth and then at the other, bOi she never could get it quite straight and makie i't cover the whole table atf once. It's all in the room, Ms. Walrner. You and I ' -ar much the same as we have been for these eight years."' "So we are, Alargaret," answered the lady, kindly, 11thouglh I am afraid you are getting dvver\orked helre. Don't do that, child, but let me know if ever there' is too muchto do." "So I will, Mrrs. Warner but sometimes there is nothing 'in particular to be--done for an hour together, anld I am not over-worked." ILIII ope not, child. " But -this was not the Malrgaret of the last eiglit years. "That one was as cheerful as the songr of birds, and as fi'esh and strlong as th6e sea-breezes, ; thisf one was heartsick' like a child that has been kept fretting: too long aftcr some, thing it wants-. TIhe old Margarett had been a strong staff? for a feeble household ; now the staff itself was bending under a weight of its own, and if the household lean'cd too heavily upon it, failure was inevitable. Frank saw the change,, half divining its cause, and lie warded off many a trial, proving himself a staunch and valuable every-day friend. The children, instinctively feeling &amp;ht Margaret was troubled, in a thou- sand loving, childish ways brought her comfort. "Margaret, Margaret, have you forgotten my broth?" would be called impatiently, perhaps fifteen minutes before the time, by the invalid who sipped lambs and chickens by the pailful, verily Believing that he should otherwise hire died long ago.    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5826-00000027"/> Margaret, struggling to put a bright face upon it, and to think of something pleasant to say, knowing that cheerfulness is better than broth, and more highly prized, would find the little tray caught out of her hands by Anne, and her burden lightened by loving eyes and childish ways, which brought back the sunshine without an effort of her own. One day Margaret went; down stairs earlier than usual, but, early as it was, there was at suspicious and unusual redlness about her eyes; but as the whole family were still asleep, she felt a comfortable assurances that there would be "'nobody there to see."She had scarcely lighted the,fire, when a ringingr tap sounded at the door, and Captain Giles stood on the thresh- old, his hat in one hand and a little seven-years- old girl in the other. !"Good-morningi," he said, in a hesitating tone. II I hope we have not called too early - 1 never thought of that." cOh no, Captain Giles, you are never out of season here. They will all be down soon." The child he had brought was a woolly-head- ed little thing, with large light-gray eyes, which went roaming curiously over the room. Drop- ping her grandfattler's and, she stepped quietly up to Margacret, looking alternately rat her and at the stove. DrIo you light the fire?" Yecs, miss." "And is it you that fills the tea-kettle and cooks the dinner?"' "Yes, but the little ladies help me. Couldn't you do something, too, if you lived with us?" II Does the stove smoke?3" asked the ch ild, as if understanding that Margaret's question hard- ly called for an answer, her eyes looking up at Margaret's red lids with a penetrating in'tent- ness. 'It did this morning," answered Margaret, smiling, and wholly- forgetting herself in her otljoyment of the quaint ways of the little ques- tioner. I I Well, I should like to live here, and have a nice swings made on ttlose great books," point- ing up to the ceilings, where the sqlunre of iron spikes was fixed firmly in the timbers of the house; "Land I should like that cupboard for mine." Here Manrgaret And the old captain, who had both been standing like two supernumeraries waiting for the chief actor, burst into a simul- tancous laugh. The grandfather, picking. up the child, tossed her up on to his shoulder, step. ping inside the door to avoid bumping heads, and found breath to do tlis errand.   "My two granddaughters camre yesterday-- this Midget and another about as tall as you are-and we are going fishing to-day with Cap- ting Percy. We shall go out in the sloop, and anchor off the point of rocks yonder; I came to ask the young casting and the children to go along, and you too, Margaret, if you can be spared, for I suppose Mrs. Warner and Cazpting Warner are too poorly to enjoy it." "I am afraid they are; but I'll go and see."' She was glad to escape into the next room ; her heart began suddenly thumping and crowding off the hot blood into every vein, for Captain Percy and his sloop suggested Alfred. Captain Giles looked after her-a new lightt coming tenderly into his face. II Bless me," lie thought, II whnt a color! . Therc's hot blood there tumbling along like the thug' and splut-- ter 'whhen you pours out a full keg of beer. Don't quite understand it ; but it must be that. H3um-M." "Wouldn't the fairies like to keep house in just such a funny cupboard, grandfatther?" called the child from her perch, giving his gray hai a itle withand pointing to the queer old dresser, full of- small slielves and pigeon- holes. 'I If grandma had one like it2 I should ask her to lend it to me for a doll's house; and we'd pick; up shells for dishes, wouldn't we, grandpa? and fill it as full as a corn-crib." &amp; 4Yes we would, Midget; and I shouldn't wonder if we could hunt up something at home that will do as we'll. Grandma has got a-good many old traps." "I've seen every thing, grapdpa, and there's - nothing half so good," said the child, gravely; "but I don't mind. Don't you think the little girll that lives here ought to have had her breaik- first an hour ago, as we did, if she's going fishz- im, tCo?" I'Ah! here she comes," said grandpa, depos- iting Midgett on the floor. "Good -morning, Miss Fannie. This is my granddaughter Helen. I call her Midget.'d' Fannie tripped forward smiling, her whole heart offered in her hand witlrout reserve; but Midget -reached hers out i mechanically, while her eyes went wandering over E'ni sif she were making a cool men- rtal estimate of her qualities. it She's taller than I: am, and I'm glad of that," Ishe slid, with a relieved sigh. I' Why, Midget?" Because little bits of girls can't understand, and it's just like playing with dofl-babies." I am nine ears old," said Fannie, triumph- antly, not very' well knowing what else to say. "O11)l I am seven; and if you go fishing   NNithl us we can get acquainted nicely, and tell stories together in one end of the boat." As usuid, Frank and the children were only too ready to join in any excursion, but the eld- ers preferl'ed home and its comforts'.Maga rot sent her heart with one party, and kept her hands for the other, Thoughts are said to be free ; but hers, for the first half-hour after tile lishing-party set out, were in bondage to perpet- ital question and answer. Tile mood for de- tails and suggestions hadl come upon Mrs. War-- nler to a most unusual deglree, and she wetlt on ,scattering advice as plciitifully as though it Ihad nlot fallenn upon Margafret! like a sprinkling of salt-and-pepper upon wounded flesh. "What meat have %ve in the bouse to-day, dMargare't T' "'A nice little leg of mutton, and partt of a crhicken. " "P plenty of vegetables?" "Squashes, green corn, and the lovely new Wecll. Margarert, try to have the squulasl p'ressedl verv dry, and don't let the corn get spoiled in boiling,, will you.? There are black- Iborries enou li1 for a pudding, I srippose?',' "We've enough to feed it regilncnt of blue- coats, ma'ain, and the Mininslia woulan is com. ing to-day to bring more." "Then make a bread-erum. pudding witli them u for dinner,' and put rather more butter. thann you did before. Bake'l it in the largest yellow diish, child, for they'll all conie lome, Avith fishermen's appetites ; and don't you think vanilla might give it a now, plecasant Flavor?"' "It's worth a trial, ma?am  and we can see if it's liked." "Annd you understand about the lunch, Manr- garetr?" "Yes, I: think so."Her eyes flo'ated off' through the open window to the slcop cutting her way smoothly through the water, which lay under the morning clouds in long green and pulrplish strata, pleasantly sfiading the more dis- tant gray. Perhaps Mrs. Warner noticed this, for she  said1 presently: "Little  Molly will be round  ttlis afternoon to rich) you, Marganret.

So they walked to and fro, this ailing hus. band and wife, each restinggforaalittle while on the arm of the other, and then changing posi. tions, with willing and good-natured love; and so up and down, and down and up, they wan-- dered slowly for a whole hour, not talking a great deal, but both comfortable and contented;; and then they sat down in two rocking-chatirs oft the hill, wrapped in warm shawls, with stones, covered with mats, comfortably placed for foot. stools.

Warner read her book, which wtis a very readable story; Mr. Warner puffed a lit- tle at his cigar, taking in both 'the sea-air and the sea-view at the fsame time, with a relish and a sense of undefinable benefit resulting there- front ; and each loved the other all the better for this mutual sharing of interests. When Marcrgaret came with the mail-a packet of let- ters 'and yesterday's morning papers--the Bos. ton Comnionwealth and the New Ycorkl Tribune --the day was not at all wanting in occupation.   CH-APTERE X"I. "OOK(ING THROUGH TELESCOPES.   MARGARET in the bouse alone, was Margaret busy in thought with her own afftairs ; yet she 'was rather benefited all the same by the mis- cellaneous details of housework, which claimed  just enough of her attention to prevent brood- ing too intently on one uncomfortable theme. She felt quite sure that Alfred had gone with the fishing-party, and just now would willingly )iave little Molly iaybough. installed in thee kitchen in her place; but perlinps she could gather fi-orn Fran or the cllildren something which would help her to understand the event whici had chilled her so unexpctedly.

His9 looks show that let him tlry to carry it off as proudly as he will. I can bear any thing."  - The poor cllildl, forgetting all the work about lier, leaned against the casement, looking out over the water at the sloop-at first trying in vain to distinguish his figure among the mere Specks of color just dlistinguistlable above tile deck, and then fidlling off into a reverie-Snell as young women are wont to indulge in, wheth- ,er in kitchens or parlors. "Ah, I Ilave it!"   starting up with sudden animation-' 1 the tele- scope!" Half the families on the island are the pos- sessors of a marine telescope; and Mr. Frank' llad rented one for the season. Margaret went to his room, and, having adjusted the glass, slic knelt down, resting it against the window-sill. She was freely privileged to'do this, and wel-, come; but the consciousness of why she was doing it made her get up again and first lock the door. Hecr own window looked away from the sea, so she knelt'down again, blustiing like a redl pe-ony, and put her eye to theglass. She was a long time in getting it Pointed to her sht- isfaction; but suddenly the clear grave face of Alfred came distinctly into view, and then her band shook so mtich that it as suddenly disap- peared again. Her eye lighted, and she drew a long breath. He was there, then ; so mneh, was settled-annd the children would talk about Iiim when -they returned. But, of cotirse, Margaret looked again. This, time she was able to inark the relative positions of the whole party. The two captains were ev- idently hobnobbing at the stern. Frank andl Alfred were nearer the bow - and encircled bh thcse male outposts were sitting two girls, in bright shawls and deep hats which shaded their faces. One wats certainly Anne;i and the other   must be the old captain's grandchild, Mary, aliasc Totuhii as her grandfather usually called ber. The little ones had doubtless stowed theinselves away somewhere below in the small cabin. Frank and Anne were every-day affatirs, to be looked at at any time ; but MaIrbgaret's glass went to and fro, from Totum. to Alfred, and from Al- fredl to Totum, till a strange, new sensation al- rnost stifled her. This Totum Giles was cer- tainly a pretty girl enough, with'her fail], fresh, ]aughing face, 'as Margarett caught glimpses of it now and then. She had thougiht of her as a cllditd-the old captain always representedt her so; but this -was not a child, but a sensible- lookingf person of at least seventeen ; and Al- frecd and Fracnk were both bending: towards herI as if listening to merry chat, which seemed to  occupy them all mrrch more than fishing. Why  bad every one always spoken of her as a child?   Was all that unintentional?3- and Margaret'sI   handle glrcw unsteady again, till the glass swnnng, round, and she was looking far out over the desolate waste of waters. She pressed her left hand tigihtly -against her side, and drew a long breath, closing hd-r eyes; and then shepassedl her fingers upon the lids, sweeTping her Iland down over the lashes, as if she would brush away something which tlroublctl hel. Then, smiling a little scornfully, she res- olutely brought the glass back again to the old field, where she found them all sitting just its before. In a moment there was an unusual stir and excitement. Every body rose up or leaned for- ward ; and Alfred, bending over near Toturnl Giles, was helping her draw a large fish into the boat. Margjaret even caught, a gleam of the fine bass as be came into Alfred's hands; and sbe saw him afterwards busied in putting now `bait upon Toturn's fortunate hook. Then she looked no more. It wass lunch-time; and, be-    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5826-00000029"/> sides, she had seen enough. So, leaving Mar- garet on her way up the hill, carrying -a large tray, we will go over and join the fishing-party. "Now, Totum, try aghin; another bass like that will certainly carry the prize," said the de- lighted grandfather, who would have given the child a hug if she had been near enough. II It's the best fish we have taken yet, Miss Giles!" criedi Frank, approvingly-"a thirty- pounder, I should say." I IWhen every body has caught one fish apiece, we are all to be called byI our every-day names; that's always the rule with fishing-parties. To- tuint sounds much more sensible to me than Miss Giles--that's what I call my wife; but this child is nothing but Totum--or Teetotum, if you and Alfred want to be very polite," said the old captain, merrily. Every body laughed; but as neither of the young men had quite the courage yet to call her Totuin, after that she was in danger of not getting any name at all for the rest -of the ex- cursion. ' L If a fish bites my hook, don't let hnim pull me over, Frank,", whispered. Anne, a little nerv- ously. "That one was so large, and lie jerked about so, I'm getting afranid of 'em." "Shan't I niril you down, Nannic?" laugh-- ing; 11 there's a ]Jammer and some huge nails down there in thel cabinn" "Wee should be sure to catch hold of you if there was any damger, 9 said Alfred, kindly. "But that was a nlonstrous fish ; and lie gave such very sudden twitches, Mr. Alfred," said the child a little ashamed of her fears. '(So lie did; but it would take a tremendous pull to really tumble you overboard; and, be- sides) if you did once go over, I should save you. I could swim about in tliis sea for an blour, so you needn't be afrafid; but I911 tic the end of your line to this stake, and then, if there comes a great pull, you can let go, and I'll draw him in for vou." Alfeed smiled encouragement to the gratefull little girl, and then turned away busied with his -ownbhook. Ifewas not generally given torntich talking, and tlad not proved himself on this oc- casion to be the merriest or most sociable of the party; yet he had borne himself creditably, and there was less bitterness in his heart now than when he had -first joined the excursion, because, belonging to the Constance, he could not easily avoid doing so when the little sloop herself was on duty. He had not listened to Frank's boy. ish chat and laughter for half an hour before ]lis, anger towards him softened, and now it Ilad fairly melted away; for it is not in human na-    'ture to bear inalice against any one so overflowp. ing with fresh animal spirits, and whose ill-will towards himself was certainly a myth--if looks and tones meant any thing. Rank, bubbling over with the determination to have a good time, was hail-fellow-well-met with bottl the captains; and lie and Totum had been close friends for an hour past, though lie remained still a little shy and deferential to- wards Alfred, but evidently seeking conciliation and friendliness. Thewomanly little Anne had. pleased the young sailor from the first. She had never stung him with any suggestions of differences of class or breeding, and had always manifested a flattering interest in his practical skill and knowledge on land and sea. Then here was this Totum, Captain Giles's grand- daughter, it was true, but town-bred find edu- cated in city sebools--yet just as ready to chat With him as with Frank Warner; and, by put- ting ]Iclself on an entire. equality with. both, making them practically the social equals of each other, at least for the occasion. Evidently Totum had come to the seat-side en. timely for the sake of enjoying it, and she meant to do so in calm or in storm, on sea or on land, and her darling oldlgrandfatherr was cordially ready to second her in this praiseworthy deter-- mination. They had planned a dozen excur- sions and general frolics already, fully intent on realizing them every one; and all the rest of tile company were quite welcome, and evell ve"V desirable as accessories. Totuin, who had been bored almost to deattl of late by too much sit- ting still, was turning over a new leaf with a declighted relish; yet she Iiad the good sense to proposed associating gfrandpapit in all her plans, and was pretty certain not to shock any body, evert with her excessive love of fiyff; All this gradually made itself felt by Alfred, and did much towards smoothing 'down til sharp and kough edges of feeling which had cut and rasped him for the last month; but lie was not ready to surrender at dliscretion. It wasn't Totumn he cared for, it was Maryarret. TIotum was a descenda nt of the dear sea-girit island, where social distinctions were almost unknown; 11 but Marrgaret," lie thougiht to him. self, in bitter contrast--';Margaret is an in- grained toady, and that is something which' I most heartily. despise!" . He -verily believed her, at that moment, to be an- adept in that species of servile humility which it most chafed him even to witness; and yet, somehow, she had qualities also which had taken a firm grip upon his heart, wringingi it with anguish. It lowered /his own self-respcct; so, turning awawfl from.   them all, he occupied himself with his fish-line, anld sent his brooding discontent down into the fathomless depths below. For half an hour fish, and meririment both seemed to abound with all the others, but not a bite had come to himself; yet at the first in- dlication that Anne had caught her dreaded big fis11) he turned quickly with the promised help, assisting the delighted child to draw it into the boat, his face beaming, as hers did, with un- feigned pleasure. Thi's excitement over, he turned again to Iris solitary perch on the prow,, and relapsed into his old musing. Why couldn't he rid himself of this bitter unrest, and have done with it at once? he asked himself. Was it impossible 'to forget one for whom he certainly felt an unmeasured contempt? HMe resolved to do it, with a reso- lution as firm as he Iiad ever made in his life., He would do it; wasn't he master of himself? And yet, in the midst of this resolve, out of tile unrest of his thoughts, tossing more than the waves below him, there came rising up two such brazve, honest eyes, looking into his, first xvitht a tear and then with a smile, that his heartt thrilled as be looked; and when he saw tile dear head, with its broncd forehead and its plainly-banded masses of brown halfr, whicli pItlased. him, the womanly faLce alive with a bletded homely sense and a quick sympathy, buit witil no line or toncci of crin-ing, or servil- ityv, his judgment was stupefied. Tile senses had taken the mastery. - Malrga- ret was before him like a visible bodily preseilcc. He saw her as she threcw off her shatwl and stood up just there, on the deek of the sloop,, in thlat closely-fitting green dress with its embroid- ered skirt and sleeves, a full and rounded woni- anly form, with a shapely enough bare hand, grasping the oar to shove them off the sands. Her whole air and manner was that of n ;woman ' entirely forgetting herself in her helpfulness for others; 'and lie yearned unutterably to clasp her to hiis heart, ignoring every ttling which he had dreamed against her. The Constance and all its present occupants passed out of his cognizance. Hc was on the sands. The two little girls caine running up to him, F'annie with her own and Margaret's 'hant in her hand, the two bright childish faces ruddy and brown with the sea-breezes; and hecre was Margaret just behind them-all their ]fair tossing in the wind, and all laughing to- ,-effier. Margaret's blush and smile, and shy, startled look, met his, which jrtst now was not sby, but fall of something which overflowed from his heart, making it glow and thiob as it   had never done before. All this came to him, as it would come again and again; and that look of Margaret's, different from any thing which he had ever known or hoped for before, seized and lield him now like a sweet delirium. "Mnr. Alfred! Alfred Brand I what in the world are yotl thinking of?" called a pleasant woman 7s voice. II You hazve sat there this haclf- hlour with your back to us all, staring into the water, and I expected to see you tumble in bodily any moment." The poor fellow, thus wrenched backr again into the world, faced about manfiully, and, toss- ing back his hair with a laugli, rose to his feet. "I am not a talking man, Miss Totum ; only ;a fisherman. I was simply fishing." "I am sure you were gone off to the peatrl- fisheries then, and going down in a diving-bell after the largerrst pearrl," glnnncin into lis faceP with at little fenlinine curiosity, and ending with the least bit of pleasant nialice in her harlf. smile. "Thatt's a kind of fishery which would give me a new experience, and I think I shall really tiry it some time."Ilei turned aside under pre- tense of looking after his line, but with a feel- ing, as lie glancedt off towards the shore, that it was almost a pity, while his feet were ]ranging over so near the water, not to Iiave gone downi there with his delicious dream rather than tlhis ,bitter awakening into reality. This girl might tease him; it would be only tile buzz of a, merry fly; but slre bad recalledl hiim to himself. She had drawribim back to a sullen denion, who bad Iield him so long that it really was almost like a possession. Perhaps it wans better to run a tilt even with a tormenting girl than to be left again with his own thoughts, so lie called up all his energies for the occasion. But this girl had no wish to tease him. He was nothing to her but a possible holiday play'-' mate, and she had bravely resolved that morn- ing, as she sat forcing those two so different types of young manhood, that, whatever sum- mer amusements might fall to her lot, certainly neither flirting nor love-making should be added to her list. She was ready to romp and play as she might have done at seven instead of seven- teen; but if no one else would accept her simply on that plane, her grandfatfher could. As she' looked now into Alfred's firce she read a few lines of some struggle, with which if she had but little to do, she was bound at least to re- spect it. The motherly instinct-wiiieh comes sometimes even to a young girl-rnade her wish to guard this conflict, whatever had caused it; and to bide it from the eyes of all the others.    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5826-00000030"/> She turned suddenly to Frank. IIWhy, you look quite like a native fisherman, too. How many weeks has it taken you to get acclimnated,, Frank V' laughing, as site Ipronounced Iris name. "We've all caught grandfather's fish apiece, haven't we?" - I I Ys, " said the boy, delighted that she her. self had filrst broken over tl 'e barrier of etiquette.

"They would all laugh outright, then, in the sunshine," said E"rankl ; who caught every body's inood of tho indment, as a goodisocial barometer should cl "Yes; and so sliall we, shan't weP" nodding over at Alfired. "Iam not hiavingali oliday renicinbei. All thiis, to me, is in tlio direct litie of business. I am an islander altogether-, folr better or for worse; so it's not a necessity for me to be merry."' "You slhall put in the shadows, then, and welconlc. IZ dare say we arle in danger of too much light; and the dark dayss are often the pleasantest to remember afterw\rnlds." Alfred turned off without a reply; but lie and Totum were on good terms froln hencefor- ward. And now every one's attention was called to a little fleet of distant sails scarcely larger than so many white birds. "Sword fishermen!" said Captain Giles, la- conically. "Coming this way," added Captain Percy. WeY shall see more of 'emf" &amp;&amp;Two,0 follr, six, eight, nine," counted Frank. II Ten, eleven," said Totum, pointing a little to the right. 'IYes, eleven. Now, then, for jolly compa- ny I the more the merrier; especially if there are plentyv of fish on the way too." P' retty, pretty! said Anne, quietly to her-   u. self, her little serious face brightening up Nnon v dierfully as she glazed. Toturn looked at the child, and patted lier cheek approvingly. "(You and I %will learn to be sailors this summer, Annie. We'll row grarndfatther's boat on Squipnocket, and we'll learn to swim. Will you?" "Oh! I shouldlike it, Miss Giles."

Ho haah taken advantage of the general di- sversion to step down into the minute cabitl, r where lie found MCidget and Fannie both perch- ed on the top of his berth, their little beadss slightly bent as tthey sat, to avoid Iiitting tile ceiling.

"Oh, are they? Is that spy-glass, a plrincess,, too?3 Won't you let her go out with me for a morning ride, Queen Midget? I'll bringr her back safely."   I es, certainly, she may, Alfred." -You see, I know Alfircd, Fannie. I was here last winter, and I helped himn split wood. I always knew him; but Totum don't know hiim at all, because she wasn't Iiere in a great whlile--onlv when he was gone off to sea." "I think he's nice, "said Fannie--" nice, I incan, for a sailor in a red shirt, and such a lbrown, freckled face and red hair." The little queen nodded, and went on with hecr story. Tthc sailor with the red shlirt. freckles, and rcd Ilair, took the( glass again after every one che had done with it. Slipping off his boots, and rolling. his trowsers half-leg high,, he sat down at the prow, and hung his. bare feet over tile water. 'The wind was rising, and occasion- -llly the spray dashlcd tip over his harry, brown I e s. Certainly he was not quite the figure for an a nlistoclrnt, nor altogether a person one might expect to make a stand on such a subject as class or caste; but while every one else was occupied with the sword-fishers, whlo were still alplroalchinp some of them already casting an- celior lere and there in the distance, Alfred took Ocellision to let his glass sweep the shore, and linger upon the Warner bill-side.

TIhe next motnent, as the restless fascination drew hris eye agrnin, lie saw Margaret going I down the Ilill, bearing the large t ray in herI atrnis, and her face was  seaward. If these twoI could hanve seen now eye to eye B1ut that was not to be.  Margaret was thinkiing: of that un-  ktnow-n  Tottim, and her too suLccessful fishing,    and Alfred dashed away the glass with a pass- ing fancy for hurling it into the sea.  Now she'll go down and eat their crumbs gratefully. rIt's too mean for any thing!"Just thecn a luck- less bass caught himself upon the shook, and Al- fred pulled him in with a vengeance, for he was glad of a chance to have a good pull at any thing; but lie3 was jllst takingg hint into his hands, whell, the scalv fellow flounced over and fell triumph-- antly back into the water. !"Let him go!" \was all he said; and no one wondered that Iris voice sounded snappishly. He was reminded that it was lunch-time for the fishing-party,, and lie and Totum spread out the repast in the most inviting manner, assisted by their little majesties from below, who, on such a sunlmons, Nvere quite -ready to leave the thrlone, and abandon the valrious princesses to their fate. Everyr body enjoyed the feast, and the fishes were delighted with their crumbs; in return, they caught the fishes, and would eat them by-and-by. Alfredl was vaguely musing to this effect, when - li heard Tottim's question repeated. Now, Anne, who is Margaret?" "She was our nurse, and she hats taken care of us ever since we were babies. Now she does every things we ask ]ler, atld shle's the very best and kindest person in the world." "Oil N 1CS9 1 know," carelessly turning Off to dip her plump Iiand into the water.

Al- fred didn't reflect-bhe was in no proper state, for that; but Somehow lie added another count- against Margaret, and so proved himself to be about as consistent in his bigh notions of justice and eqiilalitv- as all ttle rest of us.    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5826-00000031"/> CHAPTER XIV.

How long has she been there V" "Nearly an Ilour, I should think-a whole century, if you are to judge by the drecadful strain upon one's sympathies. I didn't like to wake you; and there has becen no one here ex- cepting Fannie, who has been just ready to cry for the last half-llour.

She tried to sail about at first, but she couldn't go- after a while, and she stopped. What can Ave do, papa?"The pitiful little eyes over- flowed at last--the poor child sobbing with ex- citement. "'I wanted to run and tell Captain Giles, or somebody; but there are people over Yonder, and mamma thougllt perhaps she wasn't on fire after all. But I'm sure she is, for the smoke is pouring out all over her." "So it is, dearl," said the father, soothingly; "but Iam not sure she's on fire. She lies very low in the wantel, and the smoke falls around her, Wt it may come from the chimneys, perhaps. You see, dear, there is some fishing-craft an. chored off there on the other side.

"We Ihnd better go round to the other side of the house. There is shade there, and a cool breeze. We have been makingg ourselves ill over a mere fancy, I dare say.," They both moved their chairs to the other sidee of the building, quite! away from the sea, though the child ran back two or three times for a last anxious peep, before they settled into their places. 17 I11 join you soon," said Mr. 'Warner. Ile stood still, fascinated and horrified by the ap- palling possibility, in nearly as much doubt and anxiety as Mrs. Warner had -been previ- ously. She seemed to be a low-lying, small ves- sel, with a single chimney-stack; but though tile smoke issued from that in a huge black volume, it was certainly pourirlg out from elsewhere also, till sometimes the whole vessel was almost wrapped out of sight by the dense black cloud. II I fear we may be distressing ourselves quite to no purposee" he said, nervously, COMing around to the others, and wiping away the per- spiration which was streaming from his face; "but if Fannie will run up and get the glass, I'll look through that and see if any thing more can be discovered." Fannie ran away at once to bring 'it, while lier father sanlk exhausted into his clean-. Wthen she came back, he seemed for a .few minutes to have lost the strength to rise. When they returned seaward, the smoking vessel wats nowhere to be seen. Farther away on the horizon a largd' vessel was approaching. "Gone down!" said Mr. Warner, glo omily. ('She has undoubtedly burned and sunk;; the larger stearner was probably hastening to the rescue." ;I It really seems so," said the lady; II yef' it is very remarkable! ' I can hardly credit the evidence of my own eyes." "Undoubtedly it is so, my dear; not a shad- ow of doubt left. We didn't actually see -her   sinkr, but there' can be no other explanation possible. She was snuffed out like a canidle-- anl in an instant" (shuddering). I 'Ah! that black water is a dreadful extinguisher."' They both sank into chairs, and tried vainly to forget the fate of the unhappy crew. "Poor people! we couldn't have Ilelped them; but our very inaction has a sting in it which is more than regret, as if it was just a little poi- soned with a sense of gurilt, till it rankles in every vein. I would give a great deal not to hanve witnessed it--not to have underlgone all this suffering. It will make me ill for a week; and I shludder to think what the effectt may be upon your health, husband." !"It is dreadful, very dreadcful; but I find the shock only arouses me to the height of a, solemn- occasion. I am wound up with sympathy and commiseration-as one must be when he looks throulgh any sudden and tragical opening into "I future." "I only hope there will not come a reaction," thought the wife, looking upon the invalid with tendecrest applrehension. Little Fannie sank upon thle grass, with her Face bidden in her mother's dress, trying to con- ceal her sobs. At this moment Anne and Fratnk came hur- rying lip in a blit6soume mood, wholly at vairi- ance with the feelings of the others. It was as if two spiniiing-tops should suddenly begin buzz- ing and gyrating ait a funeral. Mrs. Walrner in- stinctively shut her eyes and put her hands up to her cars. There was a heedless, pleasurrable excitement in both their flushed, delighted faces, and the child's eager words outran her feet: tioll, mamma! papa! There is at great long, dark, qlueer vessel off the coast, and she is behaving in a very funny way. Every body ivonders, and thinks she has lost something, and is beating about for it, for she must be qtiitc out of her course, and has no business at ,ill about here." "Hush, my dear," said the mother, with a gesture as if warding off a blow. "She is a curionrs craft," broke in Frank, ,"ith a startling, strong voice. ' Nobodly can quite make her out, but she has been seen for some hours now, and evidently she has laid to, to think about it. The people are all talking abouflier, but no one comes to a  cnlusion.", My son," said the father, reprovingly, " didn't Y'ou see the poor thing that was burned?" Burned! where?" "A ship was burned up, Frank; and sank just over there, " cried Fannie, eagerly, staffing lip and pointing off to the place.   Shooo, Fan, that's gammon! My eyes have been glued to that spot for the last hour, wtatch- ing the manceuvring of the queer ship,'and. nothing has burned up there as big as a row- boat i , 6 y Son, " said the father,- sternly, 11go to your room! We are not in a mood to be trifled with. Wne saw her burn-all of us." Frank and Anne looked at each other with wide-open eves, but neither said any things, and tile young gentleman walked into the house, With a shru'g of his shoulders, and a flushed, in- dianant frace. I'My dear, I think there must be some mis- take,"Airs. Warner began, very mildly, after a pause c IINo, dear, no mistake. I can credit my own eyesight." Tile two little girls stole, away togethcr, and began a whispered consultation. I'Didn't she burn, Anne? It was such a dreaidful smoke." No,Fannie;c they were only letting off the steam." "ut that was a little ship,, and this is an immense long one." "You only saw the end then, and now she ha's turned round, and you see the whole side. Franki and I were looking at her all the time, and so were Captain Giles and Totum; and the captain said she had either lost something, or else, she had come bore on a mysterious errand --perllaps to wait for somebody., He thinks ishe is a foreigner, and most likely is on some business of her own that don't concern any of us. I We live in political perils, you know, Mr. Frankk' lie said, winking: his eyes very funnily. 'Filibustering is fashionable on the main-land, isn'tit? rienians?' suggestedFrank. 'Can't tecll, said lie; I bat things aren't going on in the Irish fashion over there. Looks more like dorwn. righthusiness.' "'Pearstome,they'velostsonie. thing,' said Cnptain Maybougli coming to us. 'I think likely they're waiting for something,' an- swered Captain Giles; and then be laugliecd in such a queer way that I knew lie didn't believe any thing was really lost overboard;, and, Fan- nie, I thinkl it's Cubans, because, you know, so many people want to help Cuba. No one s:aid any thing about that, thotrgh; so you mustn't either, Fannie; for it would be against the law to belp the Cubans, you know." But I can tell mother, can't I?" Yes, tell Iher; and say I am going down to the shore, and want Frank; to come there and walk with me; and say it just as kindly as you can, Fainnie. I am. so sorry they thought the    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5826-00000032"/> ship was burned; for I ain afraid it will make them both sick." When the children, went away, Mr. Warner suddenly became intently occupied with his paper; but, as Fannie was seen returning, he said, without looking up, "That boy must learn more respect for his parents, my dear; but if he has any plans for the afternoon, he had better carry them out;" and Mrs. Warner sought her son att once. "AllI right, mother," said Frank, who bad had time to conquer, himself, meeting her with asmile. "Never mindexplaining. Of course, if I had supposed either of you felt it a serious matter, I should have spoken more carefully. I am so sorry you and fatfher, have been dis- tressed. The vessel did look Rts thlougih she was on fire at one time. Now kiss, forgive, and for- get, won't we?"The young man put his arnis tenderly about his mother, and kissed her half a dozen times. "Father should learn to understand, though, under any circumstances, that I am not exactly it little boy any Ionger,"Ilic-said, with molre diif. faculty, while a great mingling of emotions evi- dently strugglecd together in Iris hcnart, for his voice betrayed him. "Never mind, though," lie added, more steadily rand tendellly, "I'll al- ways be your bov, mother, and fither's, too, if that will be any comfort." He gave her another great bovpishl htg, and went away with a laugh in hris voice and iL tear in his eye. "Isn't F1nnk'a darling, malmma?5" whispered Fannie, who had joined them. She wanted to cry outright in svmpathy with tile mother, who struggled to control her emo- tions. Butt the little woman felt the gretit im- portance of the news which she had td com- municate; and once reminded of that, she told it eagerly, and then ran awav, knowring very/ well that mftmma would like to be alone. PZoor, Marmma I She felt as though  shie bad been toesed up by a series of whirlwinds, and then   suddenly damped down in the dust, without at breath of air. Andi to have suffered all this for nothing; she was too utterly vexed and weary even to cry. After a littlewhile Fannie came back to her father, and, sitting down on a low stool, rested her head ever so little against his knee, and quietly read her book. The fatherl's bandl strazyed caressingfly to the comforting little bead,, aii he thought silamefacedly to himself, "I wa,; overhasty to the dear boy, and mistaken in my conclusion alto(,ether;" but of course be never said so. Is there any difference between matsculine amd feminine human nature in this matter of mak- ing frank and honorable confession? There alre soine women who know intuitively that a sin- cere apology is sometimes morally proper; but are tlicre any such men? Mr. Warner pre- ferred to retire into the silence of hiis personal and paternal dignity, contenting hiimself with budding out unexpectedly on various side- branches into leaves and blossoms of unusual kitidness and consideration towards the familv in general, and his son in particular. The fam- ily generally, and Frank especially, gratefirlly accepted tlhis as all-sufficient. Every young: man sliould be emulous to get himself thor- oughly imjirafted. upon the ancient Cyelopeanr stock, and be a lways conveniently blind in one eye. For three days the unknown ship lay at an- chor off the island, Holding no communication whatever with the shore ; but every eye andi every spy-glass fair and near \as turned towards her many times and oft; and finally wolrd canto that a young relative of Captain Giles's, wlio bad been engaged to take a party of fishermen off to the ship, on attempting to do so, bad been arrested, with all his passengers, by the Govern. ment, for supposed violation of the neutrality laws. The mysterious ship was a Cllban recruifrqg vessel.   CHAPTER XV. THE STRANDED WHALE-SHP.   HHvr. yo been to see the whale-sbip aground over on Long: Beach, Captain Giles?" "No; but my children want to pay her a visit. Totum hintedto me this morning that it is always considered polite to call upon a stranger coming among us; and I've always a warm side myself towards a genuine whaler, especially if she's been unfortunate. ' I nevdr like to turn my back upon the past;i and so I'm n!ways facing about and squinting off into the old times. It kinder makes me believe I'm a young man again, you know." I should think it would, captain." "Yes; the sightt of a, whale-sbip now is a good deal like seeing an old sweetheart again. Hanve you and J'our sisters a mind to get ac- (Itiainted  with this one, Mr. Frank? Mary Percy will be glad to go with us; so, if you like, we'll sail across the pond, and walk out to hier along the shorec." "'Thank you, sir. We shall all be on hand, I've no doubt. I speak for one, at any rate." "Wind and weather are favorable to -day. Suppose, then, we try it this afternoon. When the grass is ready and the sun shining, better make your bay at once, you know." "es, sir. I always go in for your b ay-mak- ings, with pitchfork and shirt-sleeves, general- ly, reinforced by the children and their wooden rakes. All your harvesting festivals are de- lightful." So they set out - sailing across the little pereb. pond--all in charming, chattyhumor, and crazy for new adventures. Mary Percy couldn't keep Ilerself from just a suspicion of flirting and co- ductry, while so eligible a young gentleman was  managing the sail near at hand; but TotumI treated Frank, Frannie, and her girandfather allI 'with the same impartial fraternizing; coaxing ( Herself and every one about her into perpetual  enjoyment. Anne was quietly happy, and the  two young ones too entirely content themselves , t   Ito get in the way of any body else. Frank se. cretly realized that, as the only young gentle- ,i man, he was rather the figure-head of the occa. tsion, and Captain Giles openly compared him- iself to a withered old last year's apple; but lie twas absorbing new freshness from all the spring- ,ing, vigorous life about Iim. r Certainv his dear old heart was happier than Lit probably would have been with any company of octogenarians, or even with the very best set 6of grown -up people, laden with the Inanifold cares of even so much as twentv-five or thirty years. There are some old persons who know just how to enjoy the fireshness of early dew- drops and the tender down of the peach, with- out the first wish in their wyvlole hearts to brush them aside -contemptuously. Indeed, the old captain was recognized as the one genuine flint of the party, against which all the privileged young people darerd to hammer without cere- niony whenever they wished to strike up a now flashl of sociability. Less than an hour brought them to the other side of the pond) where-Abecy moored-the little boat, and set out over sand-hills, over a desolate sand-valley, where sweeping winds had blown away the grass, leaving here and there a stunt- ed hummock of shrubs, or the few stray WH ders drifted down from the North by ancient glaciers; then up over more sand-krnolls, d rag- giing shoes heavy with land, or bounding on with rejoicing bare feet; and here they are! upon the ocean--shore, pattering over a firm, wide-beach. Here, also, to their surprise, only a little way off the coast, is the dark -faced Cuban ship, slowly steaming up towards the Painted Cliffs. She, too, waking up from her three days' nap, has rounded the point and come over on the other side of the island. Now what will she do? Has she held any Ojmmu- nication with the shore?3 And does she know that many of her expected passengers have been    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5826-00000033"/> arrested, and are already in prison? What a' wealth of mystery clusters about her--exciting  all those young people to fresh wonder, as she'l sails on before them almost, as slowly as they  walk.  "Maybe she is biding now, or going to run  awav. Wouldn't they capture the ship, too, if they could, grandpapa?" asks Midgiet. "I think not,'dear; she isn't breaking our  laws, and we have nothing to do` with her-at i least, so long as she seems to be quietly mind-  ing her own business. I don't go over to cuff  the ears of the little Mayboughs, even when they are naughtyv, MSidgkt Every family must whip its own children." It No, but you set me -up on the table in ft dunce's cap, and pin three different colored rags on Iny back and shoulders when IC steal your sweetmeat strawherries," laughed the child gleefully, in memory of a "'bit of fun" which Ilad taken place yesterday. He's a real Turk, Fannie." "And if I do any thing with Midgjet, I always catch a Tartar, Fannie. Did you over find out that she has bird's claws for nails? "No,' sir!" said Fannie, simply, but with just enough of a dimple over the little face which was almost exactly a smaller and softer type of F'ranls, to show that site understood him. "Grandpapa!" cried the irrepressible Midget, I should just like to shout out load enough to make the men on board the ship bear me.  I'd tell them that Cousin John is put in prison, aend all the soldiers he was going to take out to the vessel, wouldn't you'?" shaking her little fist de. fiantly at what stle considered a most unjusti- fiable outrage upon Cousin John. "Oh nol Midgeot. It isn't worth while for any one to crack his throat by shooting to no purpose. They will liear it soon enough, and Cousin John is free long before this, I dare say. He wasn't going to Cuba. He had only en- gaged to row a, party of fishermen out t9 a fish- ing-vessel; and all that is lawful, you know. When he gets time to explalin, he'll be at liberty again."But Captain Giles's eye gilimnmered as he spoke like a bit of the flashing wave which came tumbling up at his feet; and every pair of eyes round about eddied and flashed also. I am afraid none of these young Americans felt very law-abiding just at that moment. There were a good many remarks and com- ments, but the sentiment of Inany of them was not very unlike that expressed in. the shaking of Midget's indignant little fist. It is possible that every one of the party - even the grany- haired old captain' would willingly have ac-   cepted a good deal of throat-ache for the priv- ilege of shouting loud enough to be heard by tile men on the Cuban, "Hurrah for independ- ence from Spain I and hurrah for the downfall of Cuban slavery!"' Very possibly Frank might have been tempted to add, "'Hlurrah for Cuban annexation!" 3But no one did shout that or any thing else-not even Midget; and our neu. trality laws were as much respected by the lit- tle company, both in word and deed, as though every bolder along shore had been a, kovern- ment official waiting to report treason jealously at head-quarters. After a time the Cuban vessel stopped mov- ing, and apparently went to sleep again, but with one eye, and probably one ear, open ; for now a little skiff put out somewhere from shore, and leisurely sailed around her, it appea red, without Istopping. Then just as leisurely, the little craft sailed away again, and our excur- sionists saw her no more; but the larger ves- sel rode still at anchor, and may have slept now with both eyes and both ears, for there was no further sign of life on board.- Meantime our party had approached the stranded whale -ship, which lay high and drvv upon the beach, with her sharp prow juttingf far up above their heads, pointing satirically land. ward. Her two or three whale-tooth-pointed boats lay baslking upon the sands, idly and con- tentedly, as though, conscious of having done their duty bravely in the past, they meant now to profit by-it, and get a little rest while fllcy could. Great casks of whale-oi I were ranged like recriments of soldiers higher up along the shore ; and the heedless, penance -doing ship was deserted by all but two of her crew, who were keeping watch and ward fillthey received furtherlorders from her ownclrs. On a foggyY night, when even the great and famous-Fresnel lamp at the light-house could send out its beater only a little way through the murliy air, ttiis, ship, returning from Southern seas, heavily la- den with spoils, Suddenly opened her ears at the unexpected sound of breakers already s%6shing about her feet, and the next moment she stood almost dry-shod upon the gently shelving: beach. The vessel was but little injured by; the catas- trophe, but it was found necessary to lighten her of every thing before she could be got off froni the sands, for she had come gallantly up in high tidte. Midget and Fanny climbed into two boats ',tading side by side, aild sat there, trying to 3 fancy themselves, harpoons in hand, each in fictive pursuit of a monstrous whale; the old canptain swung himself up to the deck of the   sbip by a rope which hung over the prow of the vessel, and then Frank followed, kicking and strugglingc his way Iip as he went. He peeped down directly, very red-faced, but triumphant, at the girls who stood looking up at him from below. "Good - be all of you young ladies down there. I'm off for the North Pole." "Goodl -bye, Captain Bragg. I'll steer for the South Pole then,"Totum answelred, as hris auglrhin,- fafce -disappeared.  Climbing  ropes nitst be hereditary, like every th ing else, I should think. Let us sec." Totum, seizing the rope, went up with a good deal less fuss and struggle than Frank bad' done; and, once on deck, she besongrt the oth- ers to follow her. 'LIt's easy to do, if you will only think so; and therc is almost no one on board.  Grandpapa said thitat before we came I comel I'll help you. Frank needs to be put  dlown, and this will help to do it nicely, for be  thinks it a wonderfill feat. Do come, won't y'OU?() Bid Miss Mary was too young-ladyish to at-I tempt rope-climbing.  Anne triedl it; but she  hand no sooner hung  for a single moment b  ( her poor little hands, than she let go again, a rubbing away briskly at the tingling palms.  ti I can't do it, Totum. It would cut my fin- gers off,. and I should certainly get a tumble."  9 gioll I wouldn't go any further-, T'ottim. ti Conic back agrain, please do!" entreated Mary. p "Thank    you, Mary; but after you have C' made your fingers bleed with the rough bur, ti you may just as well have the comfort of the if nice chestnut."                 01 "113tit they 7ill think it so hoydenish, I'm w atfi-id.  " lL f they means grandpapa, I'll take the risk of tlfat;. but if theyI means any body else, then Y4 let them  think what they like, It dor;'t mat- 81 ter.                      W, Btitt it does matter, I think; and I know it " does.  "PePrhaps it may;; but I'm going to hunt up alc grand father."' Totum. did hunt up grandfather, who patted th. lier head, and called her a II smart girl."  dv Only a sailor's granddaughter," she replied, dc looking ever so little ashamed as Frank and the of two seamen stared at her incredulously, hardly fe, able to believe their eyes.           ba "Howo did yon get bere 1"asked Frank, in ry, astonishment. "Flew up, of course.  Your rope spread out yo into a pair of gauze wings, and I borrowed 'em.   le "Young things all banve a right to be free id sometimes, in my opinion," said Captauin Giles, ,3 giving a little pinch to the red cheek of his it, grandchild, and smiling on every,-body with m, cordial good-will. II Ifa Ilealthy colt that has been tied up in the stable all winter don't frisk ,n about when it's turned into the pasture, it's onlyv because it thinks it's got the old head-stall oil )r all the same. I'm glad you've come, child. is It seems almost like my old quarters all about i-s here." I I dare say it does, capting," said their host, who was mate of the vessel, and who evidently d approved of his lady visitor. "'"You hhve done d1very well to come up, young lady. We were. -ouat less than four months, sir," turning to Cap- I tain Giles, I 4and Ilad a, very successful cruise. ri If we hadn't run aground here,.our luck would have been hard to beat; but I count it 'some- t thing to have seen a young lady who isn't afraid to swing Ilerself up on board rn ship as your tgranddaughter Iias done." "She's a strand fromt the old rope--as I sup- pose we ought to say on shipboard I On land it would be a I chip of the old block ;' but in either case it's warranted tougih-fibred, and sound as a knot. Thank you, though," said the old marn, turning away, and leading his grandchild. Her eyes looked up affectionatolv into his, grateful that even the dear old grandfather en- tirely approved of her rather hoydenish entel- prise. He went all -over the ship, explaining every thing to her, followed by Frank and the two sailors, who all seemed only too glad to slip in a word edgewise now and then, for the sake of coming out occasionally from the backglround where they all found themselves placed rather unexpectedly. "Her are a few odd things, miss, to put you in mind of your visit to the stranded whale. sbipt if you will accept them," said their host, when the inspection of his' vessel had ended. He, gave her a pair of very rosily-lined- great conch -shells, and some ivory -nuts.   C These all came from the West Indies." "Thank you, sir. I shall prize all these things, and keepthem in memory of a pleasant day. But, grandpapa, how am I ever to swing down again?" laughed the young lady, by way of reassuring herselE 1 1-am not certain that feat will be quite as easy as the other; but per. haps I can take a leap into the sand, if necessa. ry, without getting any broken bones." Never fear, child; try the rope, and I'll help YOU." "We can give you a ladder," began the po, lite sailor; but Totum, seconded by her grand-    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5826-00000034"/> father, made the descent very creditably, and without waiting. Midget and Fannie having meantime ,dis-' patched half a, dozen whales "in Spain," and the others being rather unamused by their idle waiting upon the sands, were heartily glad to bid adieu to the shadow of the overhanging ship, and all went forward again towards the Painted Cliffs. Their hearts. were set upon finding some 11before-the-flood wood," as Mid- get called it, and cutting-it out for themselves from the ancient cliff where it was imbedded. The remainder of the walk along the beach was very charming. It wa's a cool, shaded, day,, with a comforting sea-breeze; and the waves, dashing in upon the shore, were suggestive of a triumphal march, as they passed along. Frank and Totum, each cairying a great shell, ran batckward half of the time in advance of the others, now and then playing trumpeters; FraLnk, by whistling into his conch, and Totum giving an accompaniment upon a side-comb, which she covered with a bit of thin paper and laid across the opening of her shell. At the Painted Cliffs, a party of Indian men and women were digging clay for a Boston pot- tery. These red people bad become so fatr in- fluenced by civilization and its customs, that the women stopped working when the visitors appeared, looking rather shy and ashamed of their occupation, while the men went steadily forward with their task, as men should, but as wild savages would be pretty sure not to do. In oliexcavation in the bank, at a depth of some hundred and fifty feet from the surface, our party found plenty of fine lignite, which had evidently once been the solitl body of a -tree. Some of the bark atnd fibre were entirely perfect, looking very like modern charred wood, yet re- ally belonging to the ancient world, and an al- most fabulous ema. Every member of the party, down to Fannie and Midget, insisted on chip- ping out one or more special bits of this 11 before. the-flood wood " with a small hatchet brought for the purpose--trophies of the day and place. Afterwards, all began searching in the strata of green sand for fossils. Midget discovered a shining bit of black something, which, on closer examination, her grandfather pronounced to be a fragment of an ancient crab; and Anne had the good-fortune to stumble upon an unmistak- able and perfectly-preserved tooth of a mam- moth shark. It was more than three inches   long; so that if the monster that used it- was proportioned like our modern species, he must have been at most formidable creature. This discovery was like unexpectedly finding a huge nugget of gold by some lucky man in a company of tired California miners. Everyv body was at once intoxicated -with a renewed zest; and a search of unparalleled vigor was commenced, with no sense of weariness. They improvised stone shovels and pickanxes, borrow- ed fresh tools from the Indians, and tumbled the green sand hither and thither, breaking u'P every lump, and peering into it with hope and expectation, sanguine and intent enough to ac- complish almost any thing, except the one im- possibnle task of creating the fossils of which they %were in search. The old wine of the past bad got into all their young beads, and set them to burrowing into the earth blindly, like so many crazy moles; while the good-natured old captain helped one and another unceasingly, rejoicing in their expectaltiohs, and sharing their disap- pointments. But P1ovidence continued as se- renely impartial as it often does under similar circumstances; though some of them were in- clined to believe that at charge of favoritism might very justly be preferred ; and that their own zeal, which had somewhat exceeded their discretion, deserved to be amply rewarded. Nothing more of importance, however, was discovered, and at last the party, disgusted with their unproductive toil, and a little appalled at the thought of another long walk, turned their faces homeward with at good deal less enthu. siasm. than whenu they came. The compassionate sea-breezes kissed away their disappointments, and cooled the hot faces by slow degrees, while Frarnk still heroically tooted into his conch, and Totum played her music-shell whenever any one especially wea- ried was found lagging behind. So they bade good-bye to the Painted Cliffs, the Cuban re- cruiter, and the whale -ship, and were glad enough to find themselves all packed away in Captain Giles's staunch little boat at the perch- pond. Tile last crimson of the sunget was just fading from the sky, and it was dark before they reached home ; but there were warm suppers waiting the, appetites enlarged to match them, and every one straightway forgot all tlib toil, and remembered only the pleasures of this un- usually free and easy excursion.   CHAPTER XVI., THE ECLIPSM1   Now, Margaret, hurry up the washing of the glass, afid I will undertake the smoking, for my part.) 'Coming, Mr. Frank, with plenty of soap and water, and the driers." Margalret canle smnilingly into the room with both sleeves rolled above her elbows. Two or three immense towels were Ilangiing upon one bare arm, and the other supported a htlge tin basin very full of soapy water, which she bal- Rneed with the utmost nicety, coming calrefully along on tip-tod'. Frank was seated on tile dinling-table, dangling his legs, and kicking out one foot a little impatiently as he waited, his face all slight with interest, and shaking back llis ather curly hair as a restless horse tosses ]lis head when Ire Ilas been tied too long at the door-post, and is anxious to be dashing along the road. He was in his shirt-sleeves with the wristhands rolled back, and both bands filled with broken panes of window-glass, which he was ey-- jnnr with looks of the most lively affection. "Here's a royal lot of pieces, isn't there? Two or three' for each of us, if we like; and sometimes it's very well to hold them up double.  When th6 eclipse is just coming on or going off, it'r, altogrether too bright if You don't loobk through a pretty heavy shade," said Frank, with oracularimportance. 111wishevery thingwas realy!" "I shall be as quick as I can. The lamp is here to be lighted ; and there! here are two or th ree pieces nicely washed already ; so yon can begin to smoke themlat once, Mr. F1ank." "We'll make a quick beginning, then," cried the young gentleman, drawing a match vigor. ously across the' bottom of his boot. It splut. tered and flamed up with a sickly white flicker under the full glare of sunshine, and then went out angrily as suddenly as it had come , leav-I met a blackened point sticking up forlornly in i 'Frankl's astonished fingers. IIWhew ! what did tlat?  It has spit out its    own flame. Thatt's just like awet soap-bubble snapping itself open with a spatter. Well, we'll try again." DLIon't hurry so, and hold the end down a moment. You see, your impatience is catch- ing. A Tna'tch must always be mated to sorne- thing, and this onehhas patterned its doings af- ter your own haste." I At any rate, it has left me in an eclipse, Margaret.") B1ut the sun is shining still, and it will be two hours yet before that eclipse will begin. We have plenty of time to get every thing ready without the least hurlly." "Well, that's lighlted. You see, I've grown as careful aill at once as the sedatest broad- brim; and you have changed Characters, Mar- garet. You have broken that glass in two by just wiping it." "Yes, and cut my finger besides." "Take calre, then. Don't stain the glass, or we shall have to report wondclrful' crimson spots on the sun. What is any body's fingecr to a square of nicely-smoked glass, with a famous eclipse like this one just on hand?"P II Nicely cracked glass, don't you meanP" re- torted Margarert, as a mysterious clicking was heard going on over the hot flame of the lamp. "We shall have wonderful rents clear across the sun, at that rate." IILooks like it. I do wish some of us bad had the sense to bring pieces of stained glass with us when we came Ilcre. That would have saved all this- mess find worry, besides two ol three future black-noses into the bargain, I've no0 doubt." II It wouldn't have been half as country-likcc, though. That's what your ma enjoys." "Much comfort may she get, then, out of the near prospect of sooty faces, for this lamp' makes the glasses azwfully smutty," holding them up with a comical, wry face, and a feint of wiping one on Margaret's clean gown.    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5826-00000035"/> There, don't do that. But if von are tired,  I have plenty of time to smoke them all, and I'll do my best with'em." "Thank you, all the same; but I rather lik-, it. These pieces are pretty well done, I think, though, don't you?" "Splendidly done, r th ink." So they worked on merrily, till the glass- smoking was all nicelyt accomplished; and by this time, Totum anti Anne had joined them, ready, to take a share in the interesting opera- tion. Molly bad peeped in through the kitch- en door-way half a, dozen times, with a curious, pleased, shy face, hoping every time that she would be invited to assist,. but not venturing to say any thing; and the others were too busy to notice her. The prepared glasses were all laid "right side up with 'care," in waiting for the important moment, and the young people went outside to look about them, impatiently wishing "tl e time Ilad conic." "Isn't there a most unusual glow covering the whole landscape already" asked Mrs. War- ner, who stood looking thoughtfully out upon the attractive scene. "It seems to me that the whole sea is softening down its hard blue and green, and getting deeply dyecd helre and flicre with awonderful brilliancy of color. It can Iiardly be imagination. Did you ever see a display at all like this, Miss 6iles, when you hatve been liere before?" ILI am sure I1 never did," answered Totum. "There is alwayt3 a great Iplay of rights and shades before everyv eclipse, JI understand, moth- cr," said Frank, who suddenly remembered some hint of this which he had seen in a newspaper. "Shall I speak to father? He will be vexed to lose this." When M1. Walrner came every body enjoyed Iiis enjoyment; for lie stood like one transfixed and glorified-like the landscape before him. The whole sky, and earth, and sea was one shifting mass of lovely hues--one stratum of glory piled over another, and often min-ling with it in great drifts of passing color, each shade nlore beautiful than the others. It ligllt- ed the faces, of all preserlt till they must have "hone something like the faces of those who, came down from the mount of celestial visions in'the olden times. They all stood silently a fewr moments, and  then Mr. Warner suggested, II Let us go down to the shore. It will be even finer from there." "Shall we take the glasses, father, and stay there for the whole eclipse?" "I think we had better do so, my son." "Seac to the ri"b'lt of u1s, land to the left of   us, and sun and moon shaking hands overhead," said Mrs. Warner, with a smile. II Isn't it enough to make us all blossom out into poetry; but please don't get a smutty face, mother dear, t said Frank, banding -her a pair of rather sooty-looking pieces of glass. "Keep, them turned that side up, and you are all safe. Two pieces to slide one over the other may be very desirable in the beginning, if the crimson cloud up yonder will keep at a respectful dis- tance from the sun." Thus doubly armed, every body set out for the shore; but little Molly Maybough stood for- gotten', looking wistfully from the kitchen door. "Come withus, child. You will seeaasiglit which you will remember for a lifetime," said Mr. Warner, turning towards her kindly. "My son, plrovide little Molly with a smoked glass." The child flushed rosily, under this permission, and ran pazttclring on with her. brown, bare feet behind the others, a fountain of gratitude bub- bling tip in her heart towards Mr. Warnci, which lasted blravely through all the little whims and tempers of the whole season ; and, from that time, the master and the little serving-- maid became fast allies. The whole party, increased now by the ad- dition of Fannie and Midget, were assembled upon the shore. The wide landscape was still brightening and blushing,, in anticipation of the expected pageant,-and then the first black line began to dim the brigEhtness of the sun just upon the outer edge. A glass went up between every pair of eyes and the overpowering splendor, and then a second glass covered the first, and all watchetl the progress of the black band, grow- ingr broader and longer every moment, as if instinct with livin-s movement. 'Pity we can't haeve total darkness in this  latitude just for once in our lives, sighed Mrs. Warner. II We may well be thankful, though, for fa- vors like this, 7 said her husband. "I[ feel like the tiniest summer fly when I look up at this triumphant march of -worlds. It is the very majesty of'motion illustrated." Tile same sentiment crept over all the others, ans they sat in almost breathess stillness, wile the great murmur of tihe occan sent up its ever- 'pulsing Monotone of applreciation. "It becomes almost too impressive after a time,', said Mrs. Warner, glad to turn away for the moment to other objects; and the chil- dren found it a relief to do the same. The little ones whispered and giggled among them- selves, finding this a natural and healthy outlet to their emotions. Midget pulled Molly away   by the sleeve, and beckoned Fannie to follow, telling them privately that she just wanted to turn one somersett in the sand over behind the -great rock, and then she could go back again and sit still. She did her very best to acconi. plish, this feati but couldn't, as she had never learned the mystery of "how to do it."But she tumbled about till she was rested, and tile others had laughed themselves into the same Iiappy frame of body and mind, when they all returned with new zest to the smokted glasses. IIThere are your father and mother, Molly," whispered Anne, pointing them out to her. M1s. Maybough, with her strong, free step, wans walking slowly, to accommodate the limp- itig halt of her husband, while the youngest boy danced on before them, throwing up his cap in greeting towards the very funny looking sun. Thehy also were going down to the shore, but a little di-stance away, for an hour's holiday. Mrs. Maybough Ilad put on a clean apron, and the captain, who was usually seen in his shiirt- sleeves for six days in the week, had -dressedl Iiimself in his linen coat, and brushed his hanir, inl honor of the eclipse. "(I'll carry them a smoked glass, if you like, nIr. Frank," said Margiaret. 4 Do, please; and here's a second one als'o. I brought scvvlral extral pieces, with a generally expensive feelings thaat somebody would want talent." Margaret ba stened away, rather glad of siome- train--, to do, and was followed shortly after by A101I Y. "Thank you, " said the sad-eyed woman, wi th a bright, grateful snlile, which lighted all lier facec except the, eyes.  I It was very, k n  of you, Marpiret, to think of us. I ou'glt to Iiave done something like this myself, but it never occurred to me. We bave been looking without a glass till all our eyes ache. , It will Ic a great comfort to look; through these."She he-ld up one of the glasses, gazing through it  w\ith, smiling, parted lips; and Margaret's heart  was a little conrforted also I "It would be a thousand pities to blind one's  self, perhaps for life, evecn for any thing so fine  as this, Mrs. Maybough." "Certainly, it would; but the temptation isI so great you forget its danger. It is not an  every-diky, sight, and this boy of mine has beenI staring like an eagle, till i had to cover his  eves with my hand.  Now he may look with F less danger."  "There's a glass for him' mother.  I've gotf twoo, cried Molly, ea -er and breathess with TierI hasty run. M1. Frank made thcm all over a.    lamp, and every body is so kind to me I I like to live there!" Tile in other gathered her child into her arms, kissing her with a full heart, without speaking; And then, turning to Margaret, she said, with a ch A ing voice, III am afraid I am not half than k- ful enough! Tllat family has been a good back for me and mine all summer; and we were so worn out before, with nothing but the hardest Stones and wooden benches for a support. Ev- ery bodyv else about here is strong enough to stand alone, and they are all too forehanded to need any thing from us. Your coming here is rialit from the hand of P'rovidence. I have wanted to say this for a good while, and I can say it better to 'ou than to any one else. You see, we didn't want chariky," she said, in a lower voice? 49and there was nobody herea to, give us work enougtl. Now we are forehanded again for a year at least." She reached out her Iland to Margaret, and stopped speaking as abruptly as she began, turn- ing her face upward again towards the sun. "They arle very kind," answered Margaret, slowly, II to me as well as to you;" and after a little shle went back to the others, leaving the family to the closer fellowship of each other's society. But on the way her heart sank to one of the lowest depths to whlich it was wont to fall. Was  sire gratefill enougll? What were the benefits received by this woman com. pare' d with those which had been done for her! They had smoothed her pillow with kindly hands for these eight yealrs, yet she felt it a thorny one all the same, and was growing bitterly suspicious even of their best kindness. There was a steadily-darkening eclipse stealing over her life, and blotting out all its sunshine. Poor Masrgaret! She was' struggling to con. quer herself, and the task was not easy. Na- ture is as strong in 'the spring-time of the hu- man heart as it is in all the fibres of a vigorolls tree that has been torn up figain and again, root and branch, and replanted in sour, unfriendly soil. Leaves will spring out sometimes from ae bare pole which has been cut away from all its follows, if it can only bathe its bead in the, sunshine and plant its feet in the moist earthb- Instinct made Margaret feel that a drop of poi- son was mingled with all the sweets of her daily food; and yet, with all the best impulses of her own womanilood, she fought daily to repel the suggestion. Her best intuitions made her cling: to her foolish lover with an ever-renewed and forgiving trust; yet her strong will condemned him, and struggled to thrust him entirely out of her beart..    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5826-00000036"/> Off in the distance lay the fleld of beautiful green corn which he had planted and nurtured, and which returned all his care with usury; and when Margaret looked over there, her feet were planted firmly on his good faith. TIime would make all clear, for he, as well as herself, was certainly the victim of some mischance. But then, what demon of suspicion could have tah-en possession of him? and would it set him free, again before it was too late? He had gone, now, and would be away indefinitely; so there could be no present chance for an explanation. Brooding thus, but hiding it all in her heart, she came back to her friends with a clear brow, and tried to feel their absorbing interest in the great phenomenon going on all the time so steadily entirely over her head. She had -hard. ly reached them before two immense loads of bay came slowly along in file over the sandy shore road, and as they halted for rest, the party of men and boys fell at once into the universal attitude of sky-gazers. "I declare, I must give them a'glass too,"' said Frank. II It's the postmaster and his boys, and it will give me a chance to return favors. It's well I made so many of these."He lifted his daily-increasing length slowly and lazily up from the sand, where be had thrown himself, for he found his position exceedingly comfort- able as it was. "Let me go, if MC1argaret will go with me. You are tired, Frank, with your long walk in. the morning, and I should like to give it to them," criedAnne, anxious to do her part of sometlhing kindly to somebody; "'only I am afraid Margaret don't care to go."  "Yes; but I do, dear. I always like to oblige you, ciild, because I am always in your debt." Thecy set off directly, and both felt well re- paid by the hearty thanks and satisfaction which this little attention bad so evidently giiv- en to the good-tnatured, neighborly bay-markers. Theh Boston family were already well known to every one living in this part of the island, and all the young people were always glad of an op. portunity to show themselves civil and friendly. Marp-aret and Anne were hastening back with refreshed spirits ; but as the child made her way through the coarse shore-grass, she suddenly cried out, feeling a sharp sting on her ankle ; and Malrgarret was just in time to see a snake glide swiftly away, under cover of the grass. "He bit me, Marganrc!,"- Said the little girl quietly, but very piteously. 111steppe'don himl first. Do you think lie is a poison one?" It's almost sure he is not, darling. I don't   think there are any such about here; but we'll go quickly back to the house, and put some al- cohol on, and then I'll call mamma. No need to be frightenedi for it's sure to pass off in half an hour." Margaret placed the child in an easy-chair at the door, with her glass in hand, 'I to watch the eclipse, like a darling;'2 and then she hastily bathed the bite, which was red and swollen, and bound it up wet in alcohol. "Now don't fret, dear, she said, with moth. erly tenderness, wiping away a tear or twon which came stealing down the little anxious face. II Look up bravely, and see what a sight is all the while going on overhead, for I think the eclipse is just at its-fullest., Don't you see how queer and lovely it looks all about, just as though every thing had put on the s Weetest thin gauze veil to please us? And now I'll bring your mamma ; and you must keep quiet, and not-give her a, fright." "I won't make any fuss," said the child, though her lip quivered. "I know you won't. You neverdo." "But it does sting, Margaret, and, it feels queer. You know it mightt be poisonous. I could bear it, btlt I wish. I knecw." IINot one chance in a thousand that it is. It don't look at all Uke it. I[t swelled because it was bit just on the cord, and you bad to walk on it ; but now you can sit still, and you need never think of it again, for it will go down after a little, just about like a bee-sting." W(ill it?" "Now you won't fret, dear, while I am gone, and meet your ma with nasty red eyes P "No; you may be sure I won'tt" The little one really was comforted by Mar. garet's hopefulness, thougll the bite was still swollen and felt 11 queer;" but she had a reso- lute steadiness of purpose which was bound to conquer any outward tokens of misgiving. The whole party returned to the bouse on bearing of the mishap, and Margaret bestirred H-erself to provide seats out-of-doors, and -to make every one forget that the accident might possibly prove to be a serious one. The swell- ing had not increased; and as Anne made no complaint, and kept her glass raised skyward, compelling herself to be absorbed in the pageant up above, almost everv one soon settled into comfort again, and the children stopped peer- ing curiously every moment into the little pa- ticnt, heroic face, which would look just 'a little thinner and more touching than usual in spite of its best endeavors, Marrgaret soon found that Mrs. Warner was   ill at case and anxious, though she' said noth- ing; but she occasionally glanced anxiously towards her child, and had lost her interest in the--eclipse. She herself was confident from the first that it was only a trifling matter, the effects of which would very soon pass away; but her assertion to this effect was not quite sufficient to comfort the mother. Margaret suddenly broke in upon the quiet tones- of the others by exclaimingi, with unusu- al zest, IIThere! Mr. Frank told us so! Web micht count now, and find how many black noses, and foreheads marked with beauty-spots, there are in the company." Every body looked into the face of every body else, and there, was a general laugh. The un-- toward event had carrsed a'unanimous forgei-t ting of 11 right side up with care."Sooty fin- gers and sooty faces weree universal. Mr. War- ner bad an ",elegant black tip" added to his nose. - Mrs. Warner looked as thotigh she had doctored an ailing face with patches of black court -plaster. Frank woree the badge of the day very bravely upon his forehead. Totum, Midget, and Molly bad two or three badges apiece, and poor little Fannie's face and hands were quite as much black as white. The larger   half, perhaps, was a mularttoisb tint, compound- ed of both; for the chiild bad shed a few tears when she peeped at the swollen ankle, and had dabbled them up hastily with her dingy hands, leaving a pretty, general thin smearing of dark- ish color. Anne and Margaret had been more fortunate; yet neither of them were quite clear of the Charge of stained fingers. "This is the very best firn of all," declared Midget, admiringly, but most of the others were ratther doubtful. However, there was a lightening of several faces and'hearts, and before the merriment bad subsided the shadow had passed quite over to the other side, and was fairly swept off froln the whole face -of the sun. It was passing rapidly awav, also, from them all; for the swelling and queer feeling were going rapidly out of the an- kle, and-it was apparent that Anneo would soon be as well again as ever. Mid-et and Fannie had a wonderful time with soap and water; aind there wee aprons and dresses extrat that week for Mrs. Maybough's wash-tub and for good-natured granndmammas; but Midget helped washl in that household, and sbe believed she had made it all Iright by her valuazble assistabnce.   CHAPTER XYVII. ALON-G THE SHORE.   CAPTAiN GILEs and his grandchildren were out early upon the beach, now wandering hand in iland chatting sociably, or contenltedly silent --breathingi the luxury of sea-air. Tllcn Mid-- get or Toturn, breaking suddenly away, would. dance off somewhere in chase of the waves, or in search of some bright bit of sea-weed; the tide Plashina lazily up would bubble its approv. al, and the grandfather's old heart rebounded with the play of all this endless exuberanc6c: Totum had gjathered-a large batsketfill of the many-colored Irish moss, or rock-*iecd, which bad drifted up abundantly into a cove-like ba- sin, and came floating: in with every wave.' The more delicate, flower-like, fragile things welre put in a little separate division of the basket, to be afterwards prepared by Totum for a sea-her. barium, and for wreaths and sea-weed pictures, which she knew how to arrange beautifully upon Bristol board. "Nowt, grandfather, let us sit down comfort- ably on our old rock while I arrange my Irish- 1noss bouquets. I mean to make one for grand-   mamma, and the other to be sent home to mam- maa; and if you will put it under a glass, you can keep it nicely till next year." II So I will, Totulm, if it's only to prompt Tnn to remember all this summer's play-daly; but don't forget the best pieces for blanc-mange." "I shall keep those in mind, especially for grandmamma, who can have nice cream accom. paniments. Real cream is almost past hope in the city; and moss farinas, and things without clream are as difthrecnt from with it, as I suppose a Bourbon must be with or without his crown." "Or a Bonaparte either, if we may be al- ]owed to fancy that his crown can ever tumble off agani ," suggested grandfather, reaching over and carefully ticklingn Midget's car with a spray of sea-wreed, as she sat on the other side of the stone, absorbed in her own affairs. She had'. established herself satisfactorily on the favorite pudding-stone boulder, with her apron full of the more substantial sea-treasures, such as shells and pebbles;'for the little one scorned any things so fragile and 11 iessyr" as    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5826-00000037"/> sea-weed. She put out her Iiand mechanically to brush away the anlnoyingr something, and went on arranging her bright little stories in odd figures upon the, back of her wooden sand- shovel. Grandfather swept the sea-weed a sec- ond time lightly across her cheek, but site only brushed at it again and again, and went on with hler occupation. At last the child looked round as she brushed, catching; him in the very act of mischief, his loving old eyes shining with pro- pitiative fun and good-will. The child, in her prese, mood infinitely the graiver of the two, remons jited very simply. "Now don't play, please, grl' dfather; I'm too busy I I'm making such nice nny figures with these things, and I don't want to be interrupted." Grandoanpa, thoroughly delighted, didn't in- terrupt any more, but gave his attention to To- tum, who could make her moss bouquets and enteictain him att the same time without incon- venince.' "Midgiet occupied is Midget older than grand. mother," latlghed Totum.   "And granilfither unoccupied is grandfathere younger than Midget at play 2" added Captain Giles9 rubbing his veiny, wintered old hands a little together, expressive of genuine satisfalc- tion. "I feel about five years old this morii- ing.'2 "Doyou, grandpapa? Inevermeantoirow, a day older either--not if I live to he a bun- dredl ' said Totum, in a very convinced and positive tone-. "Wllat is the use of stiffening up every thing you do with corn-starch and rye flouri 9' "Not a grain o' use, Totum ; and don't you ever do it as long as you live. Every body will like you a great deal better without; and-your own comfort will be as much greater as the dif- fercnee between a, man in shirt-sleeves. and in a: dreadfully stiff choker in dog-days. 'Besides-, if tile stiffening ever gets into your heart, it will be hard then to keep it from spreading out to the fingers' ends.  So don't let it in there, child! It isn't natural for cither you or me." "'NotIrgrandfather! Now isnttthis pretty?"   2lolding up a showy mass of many-colored bright- ness, symmetrically arranged through every gra. dation of shadle-from a brilliant crimson centree to a vivid green circumfere ,ne. "As pretty as any hot-house bouquet of real flowers, my dear; and I don't believe any one flower ever had so many colors as this wonder- ful sea-moss, or Irish moss, as you call it, or "Iceland moss," or whatever - else its 'proper name may be. It's a host in itself, it seems; but I never supposed it could be put together like that. It shall have the glass shade I prom- ised it, without fail." "Thanks! Then I must try to exchange for another still prettier." "Don't think- you can, Totum."The old captain held up the glowing prize admiringly,' turning it round and round, and eying it with a pleased and loving surprise. The tangled sunshine and sea-breezes played on about this happy little group till they were joined by the Warner family, who bad come down also to the beach-the elders foi their daily constitutional, and the juvenile members, including Margaret and little Molly MaIybough, who was now quite dlomesticated in the farnilv-for a nlorning bath. "Cleanliness' is akin to godliness, and to a general family appetite," decreed Mr. Warner; 4. so let Molly get her surf-bath twice a week Nvith the others;" and Molly was here accord- ilu-lv, quite to her own satisfaction and steady -Ipersonal benefit. "Why, mly child, what a charming bouquet you liave contrived Ao make from that stiff, rather ugly sea-weed!" exclalimed Mr. Warner, graciously and admiringly. "That is really a stroke of genius." "It certainly is very lovely," said the lady. "You bave arranged it. so prettily, Miss Giles." "'We have been out all the morning giather- cring the moss, and I have made several of'thern. Shall I let Molly carry one up for you, Mrs. Warner, when she returns to the house?" Ijf you please! Tllank you. It is very pretty indeed." Mr. and Mrs. Warnr passed on slowly, a crowd of dark shadows slipping into the place of the bright colors in the lady's thought. 'L Who would iluve supposed that we should find serious, snares and pitfalls for the young people spread liere in the desert? And they will be the more likely to run into them, because quite off' their guardC." "Why, what do giou mean, mv dear?" asked' the husband in bnfeigned surprise. "Imenn, there's Margaret inl a state T never, sawI her before annd I bclievc it ilas sometling   to do with that red -baired sailor. Indeed, I am entirely convinced of it, since I detected a sudden start and blush one day at the unex- pected mention of his name; and now, ]iere is this girll with really enough refinement to make her shockingly dangerous. Those bouqunets are beautiful; and she herself is quite engaging, even with her turned -up nose. Sllo is more dangerous to a boy like Frank, when off guard here in the country, Jnst because she is such a complete little hoyden. Your ill - ealth has kept him velly much ont of society; and lie has been so closely confined to business, never car- ing to mingle much with young men of his own age, that he is just as simple-licarted as eitherr of the little girls." IIWell, that's an advantage, surely." "'Of course it is; but, you see, he'll never dream of getting up a mere flirtation. It will be eitlter nothingr at all with him, or something really serious." (&amp;Bu3t there's Mary Percy, my dear, be sees nearly as much of her as of this one." 'III wish lie did. Hlo doesn't fitney Mary at all, and calls her Ischool-missish;' but be has never made any comment about this girl which lie mialit not have made about that queer little Midgiet. I don't like his silence, for he certarin- ly is not wholly indifferentt.' "What can we do about it?"' asked Mr lr Wtlarner, beginning to feel rather alarmed. "I don't know, except to be as cautious and observinoi as we can; and, if there comes any real dangcr, perhaps even shorten our visit. We are all doing so exceedingly well here oth- erwise; it is too provoking-! When we allowed Frank to cultivate the old captain, we never dreamedo'f his having such an accompaniment." "I think you exaggerate, my dear. 0-ir sion is not likely to really offer himself to any one greatly his inferior."I "I Ilope so; but look, now, they are all just, going into the sea." "Well, dear! Her bathing -dress is really picturesque, it'niust be confessed." -"'Of course it is, Mr. Warner."This was spoken more snappishly than we bave ever heard Mrs. Warner speak befolrc. "I am per- fectly ready to believe that she is a beautiful little tiger-cat, who'is only sheathing her dan- gerous cla-wa," continued the lady in the same tone. "As she stands there in the water, hold- ring her old grandfather's hand, I am in danger -myself of either getting to love her or to hate /her." "Don't do either, my dear; it's undignified."    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5826-00000038"/> "The oldl captain stands by them, at any rate, like a, staunch body-guard." "Yes; but who knows whether be hasn't de. signs of his own all the time?"' "Yes. Yes ;" meditatively. We thought Frank had got his growth long agao; yet he has really taken a new start helre, anid has undoubtedly grown taller since we came. That is all very well in itself, but it may indi- cate a good deal of mental waking up, also. It is altogether uncomfortable." "Can't we arrange the battling differently?" "I don't see how; but, my dear, if you will excuse my walk on bathing-datys at this hour, I shall take a bath myself after this.71 "Of course I must, tflen ; but you are not fond of bathing." "Then I shall grow fond of it. We must manage independent excursions as often as we can, and I shall often occupy Frank in various ways tp "I have it, my dear-that is, if we see any necessity for it. I'll send Frank off for a trip to Maine oni business. You know we should like that matter we were speaking of attended to. If we discover any dangerous first symp- toms, be shall set out next week." "Inn that case, husband, don't let us make sug- giestions, or put any thing into his bead unnec- essarily. Ttley play together now like two chil- dIren, though Frank certainly is a little fasci- nated." "As for that sailor, I'll cane hTim if he is seen about here again!" snapped the husband, with vindictiveness of tone sufficient for the utmost robust health. III thought I had settled that matter once for all ; and I don't see now how Margarect was to know any thing about it, or how it is that she has seen him at all since then, and hardly beforehand. It's quite unaccount- able." "I don't know about that, but I am pretty certain that, whether she'has seen him or not, there are some days when she has hardly thourril about any thing else." "But I tell you I won't bave it; and she -must learn to understand that." "And yet I am sure, dearest, that it would never do to interfere openly. You must re- member that she says nothing, and that it, is all merely surmise on my part." Well, let it go. No use, I suppose, to go on. striking out into the dark."The invalid gien- tleman crushed the sand and pebbles impatient- ly under his feet, and threw out his hand as thou-hh he were tossing away something with suppressed disgust.    'What a world of ineffectual worry we eldcrss are always falling into over the love affairs of the young people, for whom we choose to con- sider ourselves responsible. We can snap off the-thread of an. alliance as blindly as either of the Fates does her snipping; of the threads of life; and half the time, a month afterwards, we would be willing to move heaved'and earth to get the sundered cord tied again by the firmest of wedding-knots. Anld'then, after all our fum. ing and self-compromise, in nine cases out of ten, we are outgeneraled. Gravitation is not more effective in keeping things relatively in their places, than social at- traction is in regulating social relations, if left unimpeded in its action; but we interpose non- conductors to cut off the proper play of the nat- ural currents. We set up counter-influences, and disturb the whole social eqilipoise, till our' badgered young folks, like fishes gasping out of water, can find nothing better to do than to jump from the frying-pan into the fire below, while we fold our hands with thec mocking consolation that we have done all we could to prevent it. The egotism or experience is very often intol- erable. Nature believes in compounds; and she has given to every element its own specific laws of alliance. The bathers till this time., Margaret perhaps excepted, were in that en oying L'takck-no-hougiht of-the- morrow " mood, which has nothing furthier to ask for-saturated at once with sear-watt'r and absolute content. IINow," said Captain Giles, 11the little ones have had enotigh of it; they must run away and dress. We young people will have otir swimming-lesson. Frank, do you take care of your sister. Mind and keep near her all-the time. Toturn and Margaret may both- come with me out beyond the breakers, about as far as it is safe to walk. You can dress the little oilles, can't you, Molly? and all of you. help each other, like good cllildren; and then I shaill run. a race afterwards with Midget and Fannie." "Yes, sir." "Yes, grandpapal" cried the ringing childish voices, and the three little drip. ping things, looking like so many limp, ani- mated, bright scarecrows, went rushing up with shoalting and laughter to the bathing-bouse. "It's a shame for any buman being to live and not learn to swim!" cried the captain. IICome, Margaret and Toturn. Your stillwa- ter swimming is only child's play. Now then!"  - AwayS they all went, resolutely; the girls had been practising a little, and had already gained confidence in the water. "Thrtt was very iiwell   all round. Now try it once more, and then that will be enough for to-day." &amp; 4 They are all coming on bravely, captain," cried F'rank, with enthusiasm. ,I Anne here will outswim, me in another nionth. " They had come out into the edge of the waves, standing a moment to get breath. They turned now, walking back into deeper water again, and beginning as before--first swimming about a little, and then heading towards land. "Really, that Captain Giles is a good swim- ming-master," said the mother on shore, look- ing on with admiration at the progress of her children. "Il is "a capital play-master generally," commented Mr. Warner, with a touch of genu-: ine warmth in his voice.  Pity people will fall in love!"  "Before the proper time, you mean, dear," hinted Mrs. 'Warner caressing his band, and beamin- with ai wifely smile. Yecs. Yes certainly, my child. When the time comes and the proper person--all right, thenndear." Little Molly came out from the bathing-bouse "i her bar-,- feet, but as bright and fresh its a yellow-bird who has been combiig and smooth- ing himself for half an hour, settling all his plainecs to his own satisfaction after his mgrn- ing: bath. Molly went cheerfully home to her Niork. Midget and Fannie ran 'the promised race ivith Captain Giles; and then all the young folks went off on a "pooling - party," except' Margaret, who manufactured lialf a set of sand easy-chairs. She gathered up old barrel-staves, which the waves had drifted on shore, thrusting them into the sand mounds which she had erected, for -chair - backs, and her easy - chirs were remarkably comfortable. Mr. and, Mrs. Warner took possession of theirs at once;i but tile old c' tain laughingly declined any thing so artificial. He stretched himself at length  along the sands, Midget's wooden spade in hand;  and while the others conversed or sat silent as  they chose, he built- sand fortifications with a  Yvill and skill that delighted the young ones immensely  on their return.  "Now, Matrgaret, go to the children," said  Mrs. Warner, when all was made comfortable. "Make them be prudent and not venture too  fa3r otit, where the waves may catch them. Re-  member that yours will be the only wise head of the party." "Not one there, ma'am, that is not really E wiser than mine. I ain certain of it, 1 nswecr-    ed the girl cheerfully, hurrying after 11 the chil- dren." If a cloud came down and blooded over her as she walked, no one was any the wiser there- for. She found the whole party scattered about the little pools left by tthe tide in the midst of a stony shore; for they had chosen a rocky point quite unlike the sandy' slope where they went in to bathe. They were all dabbling content- edly in the water in search of "'curiosities." Frank soon tossed down his poile in disdain, seating himself on a rock to watch, the others, and to look dreamily out to the far-off rocks, where a couple of wild sea-fowl sat contentedly bobbing up and down upon the waters. "Oh O what a beautiful shell I have found," cried Fannie. "It is so white, and almost like a little watch. Did anv one ever see any thing so pretty?" "It is beautiful Such a handsome cm- broidered star on it," said Anne. 'We have none of us found any thing like it before!" "There are not generally a great many of them about here, but sometimes I Iiave found a good mlany, It is almost like a watch, Faii-- nie; and when the little fish was inside, I sup. pose he made it go," said Totum. "This onc is hollow inside, and I never saw one when it was alive. ) This attractive new specimen of sea-treasures broke up the "pooling," for this was found on the sand. When they examinedt farther, to the surprise of all, the whole beach had a waving line of minute sells of many varieties, extend- Ang just along the outer edge of the bigh-tide waves. Their numbers seemed almost infinite; and the delicate colors and shapes were so charm. ing that every body was half wild with delight. Besides these, there were the lace-wNork. shells of the white embroidered sea-umbhins, large and small; and others still with the prickly green spines -A11 in perfect order, and the little tenants often still alive inside. The heavier shells Iny stranded farther up on the shore, for the -kindily tidal wave which hadl brought these had been too fastidliousto meddle with any but the most delicate varieties. This endless change of a favorable sea-beach is something wonderful. In addition to the eter- nally-shifting sands, where now hills and valleys are carved out by the waves at their own fitful will; one daly an outer rim of sand is heaped tip with great pebbles, another day it is real boul- ders, tossed up by the deeper waves; or, per- baps, the whole beach is strewed with heaps of stones, still bright and shining with -the drip- ping sea-water; another time there is a shim.-    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5826-00000039"/> mering of round little masses, like soft pearls, all along a series of curved lines at the water's edge; and, again, like to-day, a multitude of curious shells suddenly appear--many of them of varieties which have not been seen before for the whole season. "These are the dearest, tiniest, prettiest shells, in the world!"exclaimed Fannic. "'Nothing can be precttier', and I guess there are twenty differ. cnt kinds." "We must burry and pick them up while they stay here, " said Totum; I I for they mnay not be here again in such quantities for the whole season." Every feminitle member of the party was al- ready down on her knees, with eyes less than half a foot from the -sands, indicating that To- tum's injunction, to improve the shining hour was rather superfluous.  In his heart Frank i wats re ally desirous to join them, but was a little ashamed to do so, in consideration of his gentlemanly dignity. So, after kneeling down before a little rift of s11ells, in quizzical admira- tion, and selecting half a dozen for Midget, lie stretched his long length upward again, yawn- ing- and disconsolate. "I'm aft-aid it's rather too 'Much girl's play for me. I shlou'ld look more like a hlop-toad down there than any of you. Good-byve."  He    sauntered leisurely back to the groiin-up, party taking unscrupulous possession of Margaret's sand-chanir, still left vacant by the old captain, biusv with his fortifications.  'i'he anxuious parents felt a sense of immedi- ate relief, first excha-nb ing significant glances, with congratulations in them that it was not likely to be necessary speedily to banish the dear boy, and get hii- transported down East; and then beginnings at once most graciotisly to admire the captain's wonderful towers and forts. Frank's attention once called to these, he was down on his knees here in a trice, vigolrously outdoing even the captain -in his marvelloius and fantastic aebievemeiats. But dinner-hour came on arpace for the coun- try falnily, anid lunch-time for the city people; so sand-works and shell-gathering were alike necessarily suspended. Alas! as TIotum, prophesied, the veqy next tide, which came hungrlily up even. while both families were yet feasting, swept nearly all those lovely little shell -treasnres back again into, the sea. Diligent search was made it]. RI'Ost every day afterwards, but during the whole season there was never again such an- other gathering 'of the pretty little cast-off houses of these verve small noniads of the sea.   CHAPTER XSVIII.- A'BACHELOR IS COLD COMFORT.   WmurN the fishing excursion was over. and the guests had all gone, leaving the Constance to the care of master andt mate, Alfred Brand at once expressed his willingness to start off on it trading excursion- which hadl b 'en proposed by'Catptain P'ercy, as soon a's tire necessary ar- rangements could be effected. They were to go to New Bedford, thence to Boston?, and pos- sibly elsewhere before their return. Whlen they separated for the -night, it was definitely ar- ranged, if windi and weather were favorable, to weigh anchor next day. There was but small leave-taking anywhere except in Captain Percy's family. The boy Edgalr was to accompany his father, and proba- bly would' not return again, but wonlld go direct- ly to school. It was a touching farewell be- tween the little mute and his mother, who clung to cach other in silent, regretful fondness till the last moment; and then, wpith- one long embrace, annd one spoken "God bless you, my son!" fallE in-: on sealed edrs;, but heard\ grmiefully by the   I dim c yes which looked up to her so tenderly, they parted- not certain whether it wonlld be onlv for a week or for months. The only child, and a desolate little one, stricken of God from his bith, he ilad nestled his way, guarrded ky almost infinite tendelrness,, into the velry soul of his mother; and both felt now how pitiful it was to be cast out so early into the cold. Yet nlo tears were shed. Perhaps the slight uncer- tainty as to the time of his absence was just enough to stay the impending shower, nerving eachl heart with hope which is closely allied to purpose. atn'almtliost sure, Maria, that he will come back with me for a week before he. goes for good," said the Captain, consolingly, forgetting that it was wrong to tell fib even for love. However, by an unexpcted turn of events, the boy didl really come back to her to undergo the doubt- ful good of a second parting; and in that home- interval some things occurred of which we shqll hear more hereafter.   Alfred Brand took with him on the voyage a few of his books and a -schzool-boy slate, which had travelled with him almost round the world; and over which in later Idays he had scrawled geometrical diagrams and abstruse problems in the hia-her mathematics, which it would have puzzled many a college graduate to solve for: tiim. He understood that in this long, slow  sail, there would probably be a good deal of en-I forced leisure which he should be glad to fill up; with some absorlbing occupation. He had with it hlim, also, a pretty light -colored agate, \rhich he had found only a f'ew days previously upon, the sore. , It was already smoothed and I Iound- ed into a general symmetry by the waves, which Ilad been dashing it to and fro upon the beach perhaps for years ; but on one side some of its  outer covering needed to be ground away in or-! dier to'expose the delicate layers of colol. Un- derneath it was still embedded in a water-worn mass of g-rayish stone, the softer portions of which had been worn away, leaving the whole somewhatt irregular and unsightly. Alfred proposed to employ his more unstudi- ous leisure in rubbing away the supolfluous sur- faces upon a large smooth flint, which he had  brought for the purpose, polishing the agate into new lustie, evenness, and beauty. Poor Alfred!  lie felt that he must keep heald and handls busy  until the little process of hearing which he was, trying to inaugurate in his heart should have time to get itself Ilealthily and permanently es- tablishedl. Yesterday's dish of reveries bad nau- seated him with that style of harmful delicacies, anid he wisely resolved for the future that there Should be no further indulgences in that. line. Margaret's character had bechi weighed in the balance of his best judgment; and, as he badd found her wanting, his will was thoronalily aroused , and resolute to thrust her entirely out once and forever from all his thoughts and in- torests. He had taken a lingering lookt at some of bis many beautiful shells, which Iiad somehow grown wonderfully into his love and appreicia- tion with all the pleasant, if anxious,-time which he had spent over them, and he was half in- clined to take with him two or three of those which still needed his care, feeling that there; would be some solace to him in patiently bring-- ing out one and another of their various latent perfections ; but he reflected that all these welro now too closely associated'with Margaret. Heri ees would look out at him from every bit of color which brightened under his touch, and his 10st hopes would perhaps start up anew,; con. fronting him at every turn.  No; that wouldn't   Cdo. He put them all away, shut the lid of his k strong box, and locked them firmly ill. Here the party are now, making good bead-l way along the trackless ocean--captain, inate,' and the little mute, all alike silent, and one, at least, intent on nothincr so much as absolute folrgettingi. He is glad to have left the island behind Iiim. He has not only shaken off the sand ftrom Iris feet, but he has also cast off his IshoCS2 and sits with his toes over the edge of the boat, sclrubbing away at them with the salt- writer as though lie would wash, off the last ves- thge -of native soil, whicli has been so invaded and pervaded by the tlsurping stranger. lie silently resolves that h e will not come back a-minl for at least six weeks; and by thant time I the foreign family aind all its adjuncts will have gone agalin, lie hopes, leaving but few effects behind them. - Edgar, leaving rlothing else to do, is glad to help him witlh his few duties; the breeze is flesh, but gentle and manageable;. they have thrown out long, Ilooked lines, tying them first to the vessel, and are trolling for blue- fish, and cuali of the three, sterling so lazily oil in fainiliar writers, would be onlv too grateful for almost any diversion. Every craft, far and near, is scanned -wittl a curious interest; yet, all told, it maakes but a poor little diminutive numbei, while the shifting clouds overhead and the endless surging of water -underneath are more sleep-wooin- than exhilarating. At this stage of tho journey, witliout exciting surprise, and quite with the sympathy of Cap- tain Pelrcy, who re-lighted his pipe and began drumming with his fingers over the side of the sloop, like a school-girl thrumming an imagin- ary piano, Alfred began to rub away at his con- venient agate. With the broad flint placed like a lapstone upon his knees, first expliaining to Ed. gar in sign language what he intended to do, lie began to grind, grind, and grind-illustrating a patience which seemed utterly inexharustible, and entirely at variance with the temperament of a red-hlaired mnn likehimself. Edgar's eyes wre fairly wearied with watchingg the endless shove, shove, shove, to and fro, to and fro; and his simple stock of expectation was quite exhausted by findings that after all so little came of it-as they found when they examined the results. But Alfred wagsr not at all disheartened. Hi work would last him for a long time. All the betterl1 The motion'suited him, and absorbed thought. If at any time he found it becoming too mechanical, and his mind wandering into forbidden grounds, he only called the more muscle into play, rubbing with ail all-conquer- ing energy, which made every thing else suc-    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5826-00000040"/> cumb to it - which sent the blood tingling through his arm and down to his toes, but left the head free. Every now and then he reached over to moisten the agate with sea-water, or to wash away the whitish, troublesome stone-dust from his lapstone; or he paused to attend to some necessary duty,, often exchanging questio ns and remarks casually with Captain Percy, or talk- ing by gestures and fingers to the affectionate pboy, who, finding him more versatile and en- tertaining than his father, Ilabitually clung to him on all their voyages almost as inseparably as his own, shadow. He was a racy, now flavor in the child's experience, and the poor little fel- low never tired of its varying pungency. - Al-, ways a prisoner in his own voiceless world, an - onp. who had kindly eyes, and a changing ex- pression of continued synlpathy for himself, was a priceless treasure; and Alfred's homely, mo- bile face ) to this little deaf mlute, hadl always seemed angelic.  To-day, when the first home-sickness fastened its unpitying fangs in the poor, aching, childlish heart, Edgar went over and sat down by his fa-- ther, taking hold of him with a clinging move- ment, as though this was nearest to clasping the dear mother; and then after a little came back again to his rfriecnd. This he repeated again and again, with a2 feverish sadness which they both pitied, and kindly sought to alleviate. Alfred even stopped rubbing his stones to ent-er- tain the child by making hobgoblins on his slate, atld lie spent ant hour trying to amuse him by playing the game of "shooting French and Englishh" Thus day after day passed. They bad dlis- charged one cargo and taken on another, and, having doubled CapeCod, were sailing north- ward, with' a-favorable wind. Alfred's thumb and one or two fingers had become cramped aud -stiffened by the continued exercise of these generally unused muscles, till they began to trouble him even at his ordinary wolrk. Some- times, at night, a sharp pain shot through the swollen thumb, like a stab, warning him to de- sist; but the agate was rounding into new beauty, and this pleased him. A clear Ired band, at first visible only on one side, went all around it now; and several delicate lavers of wavy color were revealed, of which he had no suspicion before, but which smiled back at him radiantly whenever he dipped them into the salt.- water. This was some comfort; but behind all was that perpetual negative consolation of stifled thought-the feelingf that some silent process of healing must be steadily going on in the wound- ,   ed spirit, thrust away somewhere into the back. ground, wrapped up in a poultice of opiates. Poor fellow I he had killed five days and nights already, and the ,name of Margaret probably bad not flashed through his memory more than five hundred times in that interval; but then he had not suffered himself to dwell upon it for five minutes consecutively, and that was something. He had fallen into no reveries, hopes, or possibilities pertaining to her, keeping all the, nerve and strength of his manhood for his own sore needs. This was much to have .: attained, and be was forced to be content. Btit would he never dare again to look forward into a future where there could be new sunshine? This pervelrse agate, after all his care, would glow and brighten for him only when it was still wet with sea-water, but after a drought of five minutes it suddeiply parched into a rubbed and dingyr indistinctness which was Jruly dis- couraging."No amount of washing could re- move this tendency; it was clears that there must be some process of polishing and perma. nently bringing out the various shades of color, which was at present quite unknown to him. Besides, his thumb was so stiff and swollen by this time that little Edgar's questioning eyes began to be often turned towards it with dis- tressingS sympathy; so Alfred put away the agate with a sullen feeling at Iris heart, and sat down with folded Ihands, a book lying at his side, upon which his eyes fell n-ow and then uneasily. Wishing that he bad the heart to study, wi'sb. ing for a ,storm, for almost any thing whichl should compel him to the necessity of down- right present exertion, be quietly talked pol- itics Iand gossip with Captain Percy, who thought him unusually good company on this particular 11 cruisee"Alfred looked longingly off to the land on one side of them, or, witth a still more vague and boundless yearning,- his eyes wandered over the sea stretching away into mist on the other side. Nothing to do, not daring even to think. Menzory, groping among the embersc of a des- olate past, may' unbury live coals whicll fall upon the shrinking soul with new torture; but Hope can not go forward into a veiled and guarded future to bring from it herbs of healing. Slie must have some glimmer of light on her path- way before she can gather either balm or flow- ers; and Alfred, who was afraid to let a ray of sunshine stream through the darkened cham- bers, could only shut himself outside and wait, wasit. Then he got out his slate and pencil and   rnade Pictures for Edgar-carricatures of anv filing and every thing which fancy dictated, all to the boy's intense delight, and some little reflex satisfaction to himself. Edgrar, child- like, tlad brightened as the days went by, pleased with every novelty, till his mood had become almost as sunny as ever,  Whlen the eclipse came they were still sail. ing northward; but even the lovely diffused rrainbow which fell about themj, shivered and broke ,against the apathy of Alfred's present temper witliout very much Tightening it, though it made him feel to Iris very: finger-tips that the worldlc was really beautiful in spite of all. Mhen the dark shadow began to clreep slow- Iv over the sun, the sense of an Infinite Mighti! nov  and of his own utter powerlessness, be. came almost cruelly oppi-essive. -He felt like a IeclIless insect which had been impaled Gpon a p'in's point, thrust out to him by the Iland of Providence. Captain Percy and the boy Edgarfl were both so entirely pleased, excitedl only with flic liveliest admiration, that, shut tip a's he was in that little floating world of three, lie felt more fli-an ever like an outcast , and lie began to ques- tion himself of his own wortiiiness. Was he mierely a thioughltless  gnat whio hatd been content to live by his Sting, thriven(-, perhaps, by the robbery of another? What definite phin had lie ever made for the direct benefit of any one besides himself-? Certainly he had never leaned much towards philanthropy; his own Ipathway liad always been a rough one, requiring most of Iiis energy to- clear the way before himn as lie %vcmnt; but had lie not always willingly lent a Helping hand to every ODe who happened to be near Iiim and in need?3 Suddenly, in this mood of questioning, Mar-- garet came before him  with, a look of wholly  Unexpected reproach. Was there bitterness, then, in her cup as well as in his own? Had he I'uthlq'ssly  pressed out the wormwood which she  Avas to drink with him?3 Up to this moment he  band never once thought of the matter in that Ii.-lit.  H-e bad been absorbed in his own brokenI liolcs and riotous dis-applointnients--masteed i by all the instincts and impulses of a Iongs sup-  pre'ssed Young manhood which bad risen into  sudden revolt.   1v Their mutual relations had always  been looked at by him almost wholly from a subject- :j ive point of view. How Margaret herself had beePn affected, all tIhis time by ,is fitful and tur-  bulent love-making, or by his sudden and wholly Unexplained desertion, Ihad Ilardly occurred to him before. Now many surprised and question- inlg looks and words of hers came over to him Almost from the ea,liest dlnys of their acrquaint- I ance, and lie could not fail to comprehend that  b she must often bave thought Iris course exceed- i ingly stlrange and unjustifiable. Formelrly be hadc fully settled it with himself that she bad only been trifling Avith him firom the fli-st, but, finding himil in earnest, bad flniilly thrown him off willingly,, really putting her Ion, servile at- taclinient to her emlployers, with its attendant Inxuries, before all the poor love and fortune which lie hand to offer lier. Now lie began to' doubt even that. It was hardly in her nature to be simply a coqlnctte; and there were looks, and ivays, and answers, capable of an entirely diffclrcnt construction. Margaret's interest in this matter, rising tip thus unexpectedly to confront hiln, put a, new face upon the whole question.  Her treatment of iiimself and her demeanor towards her cm- ployers 'might both Irequire filrther consiidera- tion, possibly even some new interpretation. Where, thcnn was his oivn consistency? Was all that wearry ordeal of palsied thought and feeling to lose even its negative consolations? Should be still persist in Iiis six weeks of banishment fi-om. the island, or was thclre a chivalrous duty imposed on biim of thinking in tile interest of another? For the moment he was capable of but one distinct feeling, and that was a hearty rejoicing to see the spires of Bo0ston looming up in the distance with their promise of temporary relief, of e\cr so short at respite fi-om the maze of ques- tioning in which he found himself so unexpect- edly and hopelessly replungied. His -week of unreasoning self-absorption had fairly dawned into a SiundaLy of conscientious- ness, in which lie felt himself religiously bound  to settle the question of Marganrct's legitimate rights and interests in their mutual relations, and fi-om a fair'll, impartial stalnd-point.    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5826-00000041"/> CHAPTER XIX. ON THE ROAD.   ABOUT twenty miles - away, at the extreme opposite side of the island, is the famous camp. ground, where for these twenty years or more they have held the great annual camp-meeting. Some of the original well-grown oak timber is still standing in this neighborhood,-and it is under the shade of an oak.,grove that the min- isters' platform and. an amphitheatre of audi- ence-benebes have taken their stand, protected still further from rain or August sunshine by a canvass awning, under which the inspiring sea-breezes play about divinely at their own sweet but rather fitful will. it is a most delightful location for a summer conventicle, and the people have evidently found it so; for the camp-ground bas become the nu- cleus of a charming, unique watering -place, thronged with summer visitors of every grade, from the simplest pious yeoman to the wealth- iest, most fashionable, and sometimes even the gayest, lovers of pleasure. The great 11 society- tents" still cluster immediately about the cen- tral, visible symbols of religion; but outside of these there has sprung up a village of bright, pretty dwellings, as graceful in form and as ra- di -ant in color as though Methodists had never been akin to Quakers in -their love of straight lines and quiet drab. All honor to the dem- ocratic watering-place, patronized so religious- ly by itinerant ministers and their devout pa- rishioners, and with so much worldly wisdorn by merchants and millionaires who aspire to be eminent pillars of trade, society, or state. "This is camp-meeting week, you know, Mr. T)            II Totum, and I Frank, said Captain Giles. think of going over to-morrow; but Midget and her grandmother both decline, thinking there is no place like home; and if it wasn't for Tottim I should be pretty much persuaded that they are about right. Our brown -bread is sweeter than the best sponge-cake I have ever found at a camp-meeting restaurant; and I have found   the ride something of a trial to an old back that is a little cranky in the joints. But what I want to say is, thiat Totum would like to have your Anne ride with us, and so should L You'll drive over some of the others yourself, won't you? Wouldn't do, after all, young gentleman, to leave this island without visiting the camp. grounds. Why that place is just the one star in our crown; all the rest are nothing but sea- shore pebbles. Wouldn't answer to give it a slight."  "Of, course not. Yes, I am going. We youngsters are all getting as hungry as Robin- son Crusoe was for a fresh taste of I society;' but father and mother cling to the desert end of the island 9 thanking Providence that flic, worldly camp-ground is at least twenty miles away. But I don't understand about Midget. It's a wonderful thing if she don't believe in the philosophy of change." "Midget's one of a thousand; and she has in hand the building of a wonderful play-house with the mammoth clam-shells we found in the Indian mound over towards the shore at Squip- nocket. She really don't care to go. It's one thing at a time with her." I think MaTgaret would like to go, and my mother wishes her to do so. If Anne would not inconvenience you, captain, I could take Margaret with me, putting in a footstool for our Fannie, who is just crazy for a little dissi- i nation." II Anne is the nicest child in the world; and I should take her willingly, even if I had to carry her all the way on my back," answered the gallant old captain. Thus satisfactorily arranged, the two carriage se set out in file one gray August morning-nobody strongly impressed religiously, as it -appeared but all intent upon getting the utmost possible good out of the camp-meeting and its acces- I series. Frank took the lead; and after a six   or eight miles' drive, they reached the almost interminable scrubby-oak wood, or bush, Which covers the central portion of the island for many miles in every direction; and through which run the narrow unfenced roads, just wide enough for a single conveyance, but not of sufficient width to .allow two carriages to meet and pass each other without one of them plunging into the bushes and waiting there for the other to pass oft. This morning, however' they met no one ex- c-ept a produce-peddler returning from the camp- ground, where he had disposed of his chickens and sundries at prices which would seem fabu- lous even in New York. Fat poultry and fresh vegetables for this ex- temporized August city is fast becoming the most available source of revenue to enterprising islanders. This is the ordained process of al- chemy, by which sea-weed can be transmuted into gold. "Am I on the right road to the camp-ground?" called Frank to the obliging, smiling peddler, whose establishment had plunged into the ap- palling thicket on his .approach, and was stand. ing there respectfully, half covered up in a not unpicturesque green setting. "All right! Go straight ahead five or six miles, and when you conic to the forks, you'll see a board out there in the woods pointing you on towards the camp-ground." "Thank you!" Welcome!" It's a relief to meet a human being any- where here, I am sure, 17 said Margaret.  Such a stretch of monotonous green scrubs would make me almost welcome Robin Hood himself. I don't wonder the man was smiling." "At any rate, it's a comfort to know we are right,- tho ugh, to be sure, I don't see anychance of goin-g- wrong."Frank flourished his whip with the'pride of a driver who gets less than half a dozen independent carriage--rides in a year, when he is at home - but, grinding through the sand half-ankle deep as they were, pony gave but little heed to his suggestions. On they went, on, and on, but certainly not five or six miles; yet here were 11 the- forks, but no guide-board. "Now  which  is right?" was the query. i Which is straight ahead?"           I "I think we should take the left hand ; it -is more travelled than the other', I' suggested War- i oaret. Why don't we wait till Captain Giles comes 4 lip?" asked Fannie, afraid of being lost in the woods.   Frank received advice and suggestion gra- tciously enough; but like any real boy under r, twenty, he felt it incumbent on him to take the Lonly third course open'to them. That road is certainly the most straight Ahead, "I;e decided dogmatically, and plunged L intoitaccordinglywithafreshlystimulatedzest for adventure. It was much like the other; but p'erhapsthe red-tipped oak boughs reached over a little more familiarly to brush the sand from the spokes of the wheels; yet they went on with good heart for a quarter of a mile, when they came sudden- ly upon two other II forks. " Which now?" coming to an abrupt stand- still. Fannie, who had been all the way quaking inwardly, broke into a sudden explosion, "You are a naughty, bad boy, F rank, and we sliall all be lost." "I think it might be safer to go back to where the roads branch off, and wait for Captain Giles," said Margaret. II We can be there now before lie will, if we return at once." Frank looked dubiously. "There's the guide- board!" be exclaimed, suddenly espying a rough, board nailed to a bush, and half-covered up by the growing leaves. "You see I was right, af. ter all." Up to the guide-board they went, but the inscription was not legible from the carriage. Frank sprang out with alacrity, eager to deci- plier the oracle. Reading with great deliberation, "Not a pub. lic road." "Whew! here's a pretty pass!" and lie went round on the other side, where there provedtobenotliingwrittenatall. I'Sothen, we are to take the back track, I reckon." "Well, Fannie, you and I may jump out," said Margaret, with a grimace, which went to hide a laugh. She bad felt sure they were wrong -all th6 time, though she wisely forbore to say so both then and now. "I shouldn't like to turn in the midst of these bushes, should you?" "No," said the child, a little undecided as to whether it wasn't best to cry, since she really felt like it. "Butyouncedn'tfretdarling. Thatwon't mend our ways. W01,just face about, and bo all right again in five minutes. "Be a little woman, Fan, and don't whine said Frank, with a touch of brotherly concern for her genuine trouble, and a look of feeling decidedly 11 taken down" himself. II Every new experience is worth at least a quarter of a mile," laughed Margaret. "Shall    <pb n="84-85 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5826-00000042"/> I help you lift round the buggy, Mr. Frank?" s Laying hold of it at the back, she switched off n the light carriage from the track, landing it sheer over in the midst of the brush, and Frank, e leading his horse promptly across the triangle n of six-feet-high bushes which bent under this p onset like reeds, had really faced about with a tl great deal less trouble than Fanny had thought tl possible.  "Jump in there! We'll whirl back in a a trice; and don't either of you tell Captain Giles v we went wrong, unless you want me to land you a both en the top of a scrub - oak," said Frank, ii laughing and whistling to make the best of it.  t "We need only tell Totum, need we, Mar- c garet?" The child brightened like a fire-fly s suddenly. spreading her wings.         f "That would do, I think; but here's the love- i liest gray moss hanging from all the trees, some  of it nearly a foot long. If you will give us;  time to gather some of it, we will be as quiet as t mice, Mr. Frank." The moss was gathered, nd -the party re- I traced its steps; but only just in time to face t Captain Giles at "the forks;" who merrily ( spurred up his horse and took the lead. "Be- I ware of side-cuts, young people!" he cried, look-  ing back, his wrinkled old face all aglow with  pleasant laughter. "We only took a little independent excursion, to pass away the time while we were waiting for you!" retorted Frank. Half a dozen miles farther on, the captain plunged horse and carriage into the thicket, under an unusually tall tree, and came to a halt. "This is an eligible way-side inn, chil- dren, where they have the best refreshments for man and beast. If Mr. Frank will drive in under the green shed there, we'll see what can be done for you all." "Oh, won't it be charming?" was sung and echoed by delighted voices. "And plenty of huckleberries all along the road. I engage these for dessert. Come, girls, here are famous green leaves for baskets, and we'll see who'll gather the most."Totum sprang eagerly from the carriage at the risk of a torn dress or a sprained ankle, and Fannie tumbled after her as promptly as a second blob from a frisky uncorked bottle follows the first. Margaret and Anne were not less willing, but more deliberate, and the four girls flitted here and there in search of berries, like butterflies hovering over the sweets of a clover-field. "Our horses first, Frank! We'll. provide the oats for roast-beef, and they may help them- selves to green leaves afterwards for their des-   sert; then I'll spread the luncheon, and yon may gather berries with the girls." These trees, which Captain Giles had select- ed, were grown-up ones, something of the camp- meeting style; for the excursionists were ap- proaching the amiable side of the island, where the winds are all tempered a little to the needs of the growing buds. You could catch the gleam- ing of the sea through the green boughs, and the air, which had been sleeping lazily all along the wood for the last hour or two, now became brisk and stirring. There is a wonderful difference in oaks, even of the same varieties, planted in the same common sand-bed. Pleasant groves cared for by civilization, whereaall the trees have spreading, round, compact heads, may be grown from the'dwarfs of the desert. What is want- ing in height is made up in width, each head throwing out its broad, strong antlers, which rub kindly together in the wind; for every thing on the island, whether single or banded together with its fellows, must have its own share of battling with the storms; and if it is destined to thrive, it is forced to accept old Captain Giles's favorite advice, and " take hold of life right-handed." One of these low-lying oak groves may be developed into a symmetry which makes it look at a distance as if it was first-cous- in to a thrifty old apple-orchard-- a sight always for sair een. But the tall trees about which our friends gathered for their picnic were sim- ply two or three shanghaes among a great brood of little bantams. Captain Giles pressed down the willing sap- * lings and taller bushes growing in a well-shaded - niche, till they were all nearly on a level, and then he spread his table-cloth over them, pin- i ning it down' firmly at the corners. An ample repast had been provided by the housewives at home, and this he transferred 1 from the baskets to the rather unsteady table, with as much care to make every thing balance, e helping to support both itself and its neighbors, as would be requisite in transposing the terms I of a most intricate equation. When all was g completed, their table was raised to nearly the n ordinary height, and delightfully shaded with d the green canopy overhead; while a few tassel- a led bushes stood respectfully on either side, like servants in livery. it  "Now take your places, young people," said e Captain Giles. "Iere's enough and to spare; s so take hold of life right-handed, every one of you!" [e  "All ready, grandpapa!" "-   You see, if you don't get strengthened now 3- while you can, young ones, your twenty-milo    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5826-00000043"/> ride will be a heavy dry pole in your hands all the rest of the day; but if you do your duty now, it will blossom out like Aaron's rod at the end, and you can enjoy yourselves under the shade of it." "How about the cranky knots in your back, Captain Giles?" "All pretty well-behaved and comfortable, thank you," answered Captain Giles, giving a little admonitory thump and rub rather low down on his spine, as though there might be just one or two refractory members in there somewhere. These young pupils of his, under favorable tuition, had all learned by this time how to make right-hand work of a frolic, so that mer- riment and good-will abounded on all sides- brisk jokes and repartee flying backward and forward as incessantly as the lights and shades which were all the time playing bo-peep over- head; and every right hand kept time with its fellows, all swinging like so many pendulums between the mouths and the table-spread. When somebody disturbed the equilibrium of Captain Giles's equation by taking up a heavy loaf of plum-bread to slice off from, a volcano of small frosted cakes began to discharge itself over the head of poor little Fannie, who was sit- tiug unconcernedly down in the green valley below; but the child, who was not quite over- whelned by the goodies, rather liked it; and all the rest laughed in chorus. It was altogether a most successful occasion, as such entertainments generally are. Thoreau says that the wild apples which grow up and take care of themselves in out-of-the-way pas- tures have an untamed flavor which harmonizes exactly with a long botanical ramble and its sharpened, barbaric appetite. No garden fruit could be half as good. But my experience proves that tasteless huckleberries and tame bread-and-butter can take on the spicy flavor of even the most pungent or outlandish surround- ings, and that pickles and sweet-cake can be   alike readily transformed into the veritable quails and manna of the original wilderness. Even black-and-blue stains on lips and fingers, rather annoying for a moment, get transformed afterwards into rosy tints of the daintiest morn- ing freshness. Little Fannie's torn dress got pinned up and made the best of; and if Frank's glossy boots were a good deal less shiny than when he left home, his face was a good deal more so; while Captain Giles's spinal column, which was wont to be "a little cranky in the joints," took on twenty years of renewed youth in a single hour. After this episode, our party all went on their way again, and arrived in due time at the camp- ground. What a plunge from the wilderness into the heart of a bustling, populous town-but certain- ly a town somewhere in fairy-land-for surely there is no duplicate of a place like this upon the prosaic earth! One looks about him at the ambiguous character of the scene a good deal doubtful at first as to whether he has been trans- ported a little unusually near to the gates of heaven, or rather uncommonly close to the an- cient domain where they held Vanity Fair. On the one hand, a great congregation stand together under the trees, reverently singing a hymn; and on the other, gay throngs of people, in bright costumes and holiday faces, are troop- ing hither and thither on the brilliant streets, or sitting in picturesque groups in pretty drawing- rooms open to the street, or on little front porch- es, or bits of garden-plot, all chatting as merrily as a chime of marriage-bells. The houses near- ly all seem to be not quite grown up-bright toy- cottages-and the door-yards just such as chil- dren build in their six-inch-square mimic vil- lages, even to the extemporized shell and rustic- work flower'gardens, with fresh blossoms stuck in here and there every morning, and old ones thrown away for the brighter daily effect. It is all very odd, and exceedingly charm- ing!    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5826-00000044"/> CHAPTER XX. AN UNEXPECTED MEETING..   CAPTAINN GITr,,s and llis young people drove through the wider thoroughftares of the inclosed grounds, where the sidewalks were overflowing with people in city-like manners and'apparel, and afterwards they walked along the greener and quieter-by-ways, greatly enjoying the, sim- plicity, and frestlness of every thing they saw. The more aristocratic suburb, where the dwell- ings are as much larger and finer than their pro- gecnitors as the leaves of a thrifty young sapling are usually larger arid more assuming thazn the foliage of the parent tree, was also a feast of nov- elty to their ruralized. vision, which had hardly seen two buildings standing together since tinic out of mind. Froin here they strolled uip along the bluffs to the sea-side, and thence down to the little landing, where crowds of people were hastening at the approach of the steamboat. The little harbor was quite alive with miscellaneous spec. imnens of smaller craft, moving or ait anchor. A government school-ship stood a little off fom shore, and one of ,her boats, withh the boys in Uniform, was now approaching the wharlf, the long double series of oars gleaning in the sun- shine as it came, 11111king the boat and its occu- pants look like some curiouss and beautifull centi- pede; and over a jutting promontory at the left were visible', in the distance, the masts of ships and the spires of thfe churches of Old Town. This was it scene wholly different from the long stretch of waters-broken az little on either side by outstandingE rocks--which spread out to tile horizon from their own pleasant beach. There every flshing-smack is a novelty; every child who strolls along the shore, and every farmer who drives down to a little off -lying cove to gather sea-weed, becomes a pleasant and note- worthy acquaintance. Here multitudes of peo- ple were coming and going at the landing of every steamboat, as restlessly as bees flit in and out from their hives in time of clover-blossoms. Our party seated themselves iipon one of the long benches which overllang the sea, a little   outside of the crowd, all thoroughly prepared for enjoyment. "Evelry thing here looks just like a celebra-- tion-daly," said Anlne; "but I like it ever so 'Of cotirse, we all do," said Frank; "Lbut it isn't so much better or different from old Bo0s- ton after all, or it wouldn't be if every man there didn't have I business, business, basted on to both Iiis coat-tails. If all Bo0ston would go in for a general play-day some time, it would be nearly as jolly as this.,' "I think it's all so nice, isn't it, Totum? cried Fanlnie half wild with deli(Tht. "I wishl we lived hcrri-don't you V "'I should like it for a week and a day, but I don't know about all Sumner, Fannie. I line a long holiday where there isn't any need of having too much starch in your dresses." "Dearinel. Well,Idon't,then. It'severso mucli pleasanter here than on our side of tho islands Don't you think so, Captain Giles?" "The old squirrel liked his own bole in the old tree, you recme mber, puss," he answered, smiling, and patting the little band which she held out to him  it was only the young otic wlio was crazy for a change. 3But I expect most people would agree with you. You see they do, fifty to one." All this time Margaret's color wag coming and going in a fever of excitement, for among the various vessels coming into port she had just recognized the Constance., This was so wholly unexpected that it had almost taken away her breath, yet she sat looking in entire silence. The steamboat came and went, and tfien the Constance drew up to the landing. "Heigh-bo! If there isn't Captain Percy and Iris sloop! I thought he was off on a long cruiseS. So he was, too, but I suppose he bas changed his mind, and come down here in the way of trade or passengers," said Captain Giles. "There are people on board, some of them just coming up from the little cabin, and others   making ready to step on shore," said Frank, looking intently.' 'LThere I there are two Bos. ton nien. I know them both in thei way of busi- neCSS. 1 Yes, tliat's it; they are his freight. Ile "1as sliot bff down here ill a tangent, and, I dare say, inade a good thing by it. Likely they pleferred a sail with hime to the stearn- boat; and I am glad to see the old fellow; for Iiis sloop is good for a -night's lodging, if I can't find a bettrrr." After the passengers and their baggage bad landed, Captain Percy and Edgar came on shore, and were immediately waylaid by Captain Giles and the children, who were all glad to see the little nitite ; for they tiad bid him good-bye, not expecting to meet him again. Tlicy all went to(,ctler to the campg61ound; but Alfted, who remained on board the sloop, to put both her and himself in holiday order bhad not yet dis- covered the presence of the home-party. Evclry tongue that could talk was ready to do so; but Margal'et's found very little to say. , She smiledd kindly upon the boy Edgar, both for his own sake, and with a feeling that he had just come like a messenger of good-will firom the presence of another who loved hiim.  Her thought,- were arrested and held, evciry now and then, by sonie- thiing joing on about tier; but they flew back every moment to the Constanc -e like a troop of "arrierc-pigeonsn longing for their filst dove-cote. Early in the evening, when the lamps at the campg-Cround  were brilliantly lighted in-doors and out, the lights and shadows playing bide- and-seek around the houses and among the trees beguiled hundreds of people into a maze of sympathetic, busy idleness. They were ev- , crywhere promenading the streets, in filll en- joymenlt of the cool, delightful evening. The -voice of prayer and the singing of: hymns began around the speaker's stand ivhere' the meetings wclre held ; and there was lighter music and so. cial singing here and there in cottages farther raway. In one cheery little drawing-room a lady sat playing, on a Ielodeon, and around her were grouped-several gentlemen and ladies singing sweet an d stirring ballads, which so moved the hearts of passers-by that a crowd gathered out- side the door to listen. A whisper passed to find fro among the people, "It is the Hutchin-  sons! 8ome of them are the Hutchrinsons!" and -go the listeners increased in number. The hos- pitable door was thrown wide open, the outside throng looking and listening, apparently both a welcome and an appreciative audience. Frank, Toturn, Margaret, and the children   were all here; and as Margnaret turned a lit- tle to make room for a passer-by, her eyes fell upon Alfired Brand standing there in the shad- ow of the house, and evidently wrapped up in the melody. Her heart thumped so wildly for a nioment it seemed to her it was louder than the music, and might be beard by others besides Iierself. With a strdng effort she stilled its beating, and her resolution was quickly tahen. She would ask an interview, and try to really solne explanation of a course which seemed to lier so wholly unnccountable. All the aLfter- noon she had been thinkring of this, and hoping the opportunity would come to her. "Stay with the others, Fannie; I'll be back again soon," she whispclrcd, loosening the child's hand from herl own, and quEickly losing helrself in the crowd, without, however, taking her eyes from her lover,, lest lie shouldc suddenly disatp- pear. Very quietly she came tip in the oppo- site direction, till they stood face to face andi eye to eye-bers mutely asking, "Will you let Inc speak with youP" but the question lingered upon her lips-hiis piercing her at first with a start of surprise, and then with a flash like an- ger or disappro-val. Instantly lie turned and was gone, wliile she stood silent, humiliated. Sol then) it really is all over. Well, I can bear it  I will bear it! I was not asking for his good-will, but for an explanation."Alld now her thoughts grrcw hot and indignant. "He-I is Uaj"St--lln01'thy f MO! Yes, it is over. I 'II no moire of hiir." She walked on blindly and -rapidly; and it seemed to her that she was literally tearing a great burden of hopeless doubt and passion out of her heart and casting it fromlber forever. After a little, summnoning all -her pride and strong will to conquer herself, she came back to Fannie and tool; the child's band again into her own. III th inkit is time to go to the meeting. Shall we go, Nif r. Frank?" Comel Totum, and all of vou, we are goonC! to the meeting!" echoed the child, giving evelry body a pull and a sake. Yes, it was time. The others took the lead, and Mai. aret and the little, girl followed. "O, ,isn't it nice?  Don't you feel sohappy ]Iere, Margaret?"pl asked the child, watth irr-epress. We ex ccitement. Don't I: seem so, darliny? and let's try to be good, too. You must listen to all that is said by the minister, Fannie. You know we come to the camp-meeting to learn how to grow  better, just as we go to church on Sundays." I'Dowee  "  The child scemedtothiinkaamo.    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5826-00000045"/> ment, and then she added, "t It is not at all like going to church!" "I think it is a great deal more solemn to sit under the trees, when you are thinking about God and heaven, than to be in a meeting- house." "Is it? Then I'll try to think so, and sit still." Poor Margaret felt that there was a world of music and light outside of herself, but it was al- most hopeless for her ever to try to climb into it. She must look up to the higher world for her only comfort. She only longed now to cover herself with the deepest shade she could find. She seated herself as best she could in the midst of the great, restless, motley congre- gation, and bowed her head in an agony of pres- ent suffering, and importunate prayer for a no- ble and final self-conquest. A great stillness and exaltation gradually found its way into her heart; and when her face was raised again and the light fell upon it, it was the face of a strong woman who was con- tent. All this time Alfred Brand was standing not far off, hiding in a shadow deeper than any that had ever fallen upon Margaret. he had been watching her with a sense of mingled guilt and anguish. When she came to him he had flung himself off impulsively into the darkness; but the next moment he retraced his steps and be- gan groping about for her everywhere; bitterly regretting his own folly in not helping her to an interview, which they both so earnestly de- sired. He had walked hurriedly about in every direction, but had not found her till just as she returned to Fannie; then he had pressed after her as she walked, overhearing the most of her conversation with the child; but he could not gain courage to speak with her, surrounded as she was by all the others. Up to the moment of her coming to him, Al- fred had not once thought of the possibility of Margaret's being upon the camp-ground. It was not suggested to him as probable by any thing which he knew of her habits or of her po- sition in Mr. Warner's family. That he would meet home acquaintances here he supposed very likely; and knowing the limited accommoda- tions of the place for the wants of, perhaps, ten- exaggeration said even fifteen-thousand people, he had proposed to Captain Percy to offer his berth in the Constance to any friend whom he might find in need of it, while he himself would sleep on deck wrapped up in a blanket. But he had himself purposely avoided every one; and had but just returned from a lonely walk   along the beach, where he had brooded over their affairs to his heart's ever-growing discon- tent. On the downward trip, the presence of sev- eral passengers had prevented many thoughts; and, besides, he was more than willing to push the whole troubled question farther back into the future. His thoughts at the sea-side had but one outcome-he must see Margaret again, and arrive at some final and full explanation, both for her sake and for his own; yet when she stood before him, her troubled look asking for the same thing, some perverse demon of con. tradiction suddenly possessed him. The next instant he had sought her with bitter self-con- demnation; and while he had watched her sit- ting with bowed head among the congregation, her whole frame shaken now and then with the silent struggle of emotion, his wayward heart melted towards her, and went out to her again with sudden, inexpressible yearning to give her comfort. All the wrong came home to himself. The solemnity of the occasion, the voice of prayer and preaching, surrounded her with an atmos- phere which seemed immeasurably removed from many of his past thoughts of her. There was no vestige here of a cringing, servile spirit; or one that could delight in an unworthy, girlish teasing of a sincere heart which offered her its best treasure. All that was a cruel mistake. Now at last lie filly recognized and admitted to himself that hers was an upright, unselfish character, and that the unworthy qualities which he had attributed to her were delusions of his own morbid vision. When the light fell upon her serene, wide forehead as she lifted it up, it seemed to him to be lighting up the brow of an angel. He could have fallen at her feet in humility-confessing his own guilt, and of- fering the only tribute left to offer, a steadfast, manly love and worship; but she was surround- ed now by impassable barriers. It was impossible to remain inactive. He sat down, and rose up, and went out into the night, walking to and fro in a fever of hope, self-re- proach, and a terrible fear lest he had himself put the cup of happiness behind him forever. All the shyness and gaucherie of his nature and of his ungentle breeding, came to taunt and molest him. When the meeting broke up, he summoned all his manliness to the rescue; but Margaret was surrounded by her phalanx of young peo- ple and the two captains; and though he went closely after them, struggling with his burden of passionate feeling, he had not the courage to   make his presence known till he saw them en- tering one of the hospitable. cottages not far away. Now it was too late; but in the morn- ing-in the earliest morning-he would seek her. The four girls had found accommodations in this cottage; Captain Giles would occupy Al- fred's berth in the Constance; and Frank, in the crowded condition of the place, finding no bet- ter accommodations open to him, had decided to try one of the Society tents, where lodging was to be had at two dimes per night, upon a straw shakedown, in a large inclosure, divided about midway by a canvas curtain-men and boys oc. cupying one division, and women and girls the other. Frank thought he should enjoy the fun of the thing mightily. When the party separated-the two captains and the boy Edgar bound for the sloop, and Frank going his way alone-Alfred stood afar off, and afterwards went marching up and down like a sentinel before the cottage, whose friend- ly, open door still gave him a glimpse of Marga- ret sitting in the background. Then came the hour of general shutting up. Every house-door was closed, the curtains of every tent dropped, and the singing of hymns burst out simultaneously on every hand, follow- ed by stiller subdued voices engaged in prayer. It was the common hour when almost every household and separate little community offered up its evening worship. Alfred still wandered to and fro, feeling shut out from the place of all his hopes-at last standing reverently, and with bowed head, before the white muslin curtain where Margaret's kneeling shadow was falling with all the others; but when there was a sound   of rising from within, he took is way out of the inclosure to the sea-side, wandering off for miles along the shore. All the darkened chambers of his soul were thrown open now to the light; but it was only the hazy moonlight which could find its way in there as yet. Hour after hour he roamed over the sands, forgetful of time, for- getful of every thing but the one hope of making a generous reparation for all his injustice to Margaret, and of securing the now-coveted boon of her forgiveness and love. At last lie found himself upon the deck of his little vessel; but here every thing around him quickened memory, raising within him a new fever of hope and unrest which kept heart and brain both throbbing long after he lay wrapped up in his blanket, with a roll of something un- der his head for a pillow; and not till morning began to lighten the horizon in the east did he finally fall asleep. Memory is a canvas on which real things are painted in sober colors; but Hope is a looking- glass in which fancies stalk about like personi- fied rainbows. When a human soul can look steadfastly neither at the one nor the other, but is fascinated with each by turns, in the burning focus of this double vision there is no more rest for it than for one of Milton's shadows of limbo. All its thoughts are vanity. "A violent cross-wind from either coast Blows them transverse, ten thousand leagues away Into the devious air." Even in sleep, its vain imaginings, "Up-whirled aloft Fly o'er the back side of the world far off." Poor Alfied!   CHAPTER XXI. AT CAMP-MEETING.   MEEANTIME Frank was equally sleepless upon his straw shakedown in one of the Society's tents. Surrounded by half a hundred sleepers, more or less, most of them fully intent upon getting their money's worth of solid rest, he tossed to and fro, quarrelling with the one chronic nuisance of the island generally-the wicked flea, who every man pursueth. The sonorous breathing of the multitude seemed to be carried on in almost every key, and with the most entertaining-variety of time. One man bursts into sleepy snatches of song, and another of laughter; while a third, half   waking, pompously commands silence, pleasant- ly unconscious that he is spending his own breath superfluously, like one laying down the lawe to the idle wind, whi h "c bloweth where it listeth."When the great knitting-machine of a common dormitory is looping up the dropped stitches and knotting the broken ends of the many fretted cares of the whole sleeping mule titude at once, any sleepless one in the midst is certain to find himself getting hopelessly tangled up in the mysterious social web. He begins to realize that no man sleepeth to himself, and that he is personally interested in every breath    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5826-00000046"/> which is drawn so unconsciously all about him. In the evening, while the bloom of novelty still rested upon every thing, our young gentle- man found every incident, even the most trivial, only vastly entertaining. Evey soul about him a stranger, he felt entirely free to keep up an in- ternal laugh impartially at any body's expense. Young men gossiped and old men moralized, alike to his unlimited edification.  "Did ye see Mary Parson's pink parasol, ch, John?"' whispered one red-cheeked youth, with his lip close to his companion's ettr, buth their Leads nestled together on the same rolled -up coverlet. "Yes ; pretty as a rainbow; but Tom Phil- lip seemed to get caught with it, any how. Ile couldn't keep his eyes off it--or else, off her. It's worth while, I[ tell ye, Bill1, to livng out a bright rag to catch eyes on." "Speak small, can't .ve, John Coxi I hear her titteringi on the other side the curtain ; and if we can- hearthem, they can hear us--unless you can man'age to fire softly." "Course! Tihat's just what I'm doing. I just beard something about ruffled pillow-slips and furbelows. Therec's half a dozen girls there together, right on the other side, all buzzing like mnusquitoes; and they are about as long in get- ting settled. They won't heair us. You inigiht as well expect a drove of blackbirds to stop twit- tering: long enough to hear any voices except their own." "Only won'tt do to be too sure about it. I've heard things said on the other side of the curtain before to-night." "Yes, sir," said one elderly gentleman to an- other, in a sonorous, sub-nasal tone, that every body was welcome to hear who liked; 16 we all need an annooal shlower of refreshing. The camp-ground is the Lord's own vineyard-canll it watering -place or: what you like. Nobody comes up here but getsbeiiefited if lie will." "That's so; the Saviour's always here, and if all don't meet him,- it's their own fault."  I Certain it is; 'and, besides, a good many seem 'compelled to meet him, whether they will or no.17 "I must have my launnum!" muttered a thin-faced, whining man, starting up desperately from his restless bunk, and making his way over a billowy sea of heads and legs towards the can- vas division between the male annd female do- mains. II Sara, Sara, I can't sleep! Hand me through my laudanum, Sara. Iwant my laud- anum!" General cheers and laughter, and a jubilant   bobbing up of heads, miscellaneously ornament. ed with straw or night-caps. 'I ain't making fun. I'm in earnest; I can't sleep." Another voice. LLHand me out the demi- john. I can't sleep."' "Nor I neither. I wan't some of Mrs. Wins- low's soothing sirup."More laughter; and el- derly-voiced cries of, "F or shame, boys! Be quiet, can't you!" Tap! tap! tap! outside of the tent. This is the rap of the policeman, taking his rounds, and alert for duty. "Quiet inside! KZeep order there, I say "--followed by juvenile male echoes, commanding "Order, order, andaageneral femn. inine titter of 11 hushes" and suppressed laughter. "I 'tell you, I ain't a-jooking. I can't sleep, and I must have my laudanum. Do you bear, Saraa It's in your bag in there, rolled up in a paper." "If I llad to take thant, I'd stay at home and do it there, " muttered a woman's voice; but whether poor Sarah's or not didn't appear. "So would P!" in sonorous-, masculine re- sponse. "I tell you I must have it!" "'Do be quiet, father, I'ni getting it!" in an unmistakanbly distlressed tone which brought a lull of genuine sympathy. Sarah was evidently stumbling her way over diffcuties, guided byv the dim light; and after a delay long enou-h for sleepy people to doze off comfortably, Sar-ah's hand was thrust under the canvas and the laudanum was forthcoming. Whant was done with it in the darkness Framnk was unable to discover; but the poor old man dlropped into his own place again and subsided. Every one wlio could sleep slept at last, all the more bcaviljr it seemed for the stifling at- mospliere which kept the wakefill ones tossing frantically, to the discomfort of the half a- dozen sleepers packed like sardines on every side of them. As though the atinosphere was not sti. flingf enough already for the most lethargic rest, men helre and there wrapped up their cars and mouths in handkerchiefs find bed-quilts, at the imminent risk of sleeping themselves into apo- plexy, probably actuarted by the same principle which incites the Irish mother to smother her baby under a mountain of bed-clothes-,,L It jist slopes the longer for it, ye see!" Frank noted all these things with a merry eye and some graver mental comments,keennlv enjoying all the new shades of, his experience as only a fresli,boyrish nature can. Bat he was fast verging into a manliness where thought pre-' dominates over amusement. He became grave   -even depressed, at last-both in body and soul. "e would faill have slept now; but if his eve- lids bad been propped open with needles, the luxury of sleep could hardly havee been farther Removed from him. So, he tossed and ponder- ed; anathematized human stupidity, and felt. dlesperately inclined to poke a hole somewhere through the canvas roof of this hermetically- scaled canvas prison. In the visions of his fiead upon his bed he even nieditated'speakingr out next day in meeting and giving a public lecture on ventilation; but at the first day- dawning lie found that his courage needed the! goadi of darkness to prick it into action. In the night he had felt an actite fellow-sympathy withl all Ihis sleeping compatriotsf but, in tile Inorning it was so much easier to slough out of tile hot bed into -which be had unwarily fallen: thann to trv to lot in air alld comfort upon bis fellow-sufferers, that he only tunibled himself into the open day, shaking the last night's straw out of his bair, and washing tihe memoryv of last nigltt's experience off his face. It is immense- Iv hurnan to turn, one's back- upon evils whicli it is a great deal easier to forget than to remedy. Though Frank Irose nearly, yet with character- istic carrip-meeting energy, the village was al- Iready astir. A stalwart, red-checked country- man had preceded him at the perennial fount- a-in which had been persuaded to bubble tip to the surface by boring a few feet into the sand. he was still there rubbing: vigorously with a crash towel, and his abundant, hearty chieeri- ness straightwayn flowed over into Frank'srready sympathies.. &amp;CI've been here ait these meetings now for these tnrenty years, ever since I was a shaver that high, and there's been ah amaZiDng change hecre since then, I can tell ye. It's changed faster in the last year or two than ever before. You see it used to be nothingi but tents, and we all comie with staves in our hands in those davs-a, lot of real dusty pilgrims. Now we live 1wincipally in ceiled houses, but the greater part hav\e been built within three or fotir years." "It's rather more of a watd'ring-place now than a camp-meeting, isn't it?" "Well, no, there's a powerful -amount of good done, aind a great many conversions everyc year. Some of our people think it wouldl be better to sell out here and go farther back into the coun- try for the camp-ground; but if the world is ready to come to us, we otight not to run off oui of the world, I think ; and that sentiment is pret7 ty strong yet.") "The land must be getting very valuable nowP   (LYes, it is. It's a standin a evidence that if we alre ready to work for thet Lord lie is ready' to pay us for it. This property is a great help now' to the denominationn" "I suppose so, and will be more and more everv year." 'i sit will. There's every thing to make us faithful, if only we don't get vain-glorious." The man's ruddy face bearned with a genuine satisfaction, wilich, if the' earth bard helped to -give, Heavevn also had some share in. "The police regulations llere seem excel- lent," said Frank, glad to recld the glow of simple pleasure in the man's face; it helped brighten his own' heart. "The streets fectly clean and tidy-, and must be unic best supervision." "That's so. No nuisance is allowed  rc and every thzinfv is looked after with a sharp eye. Now at this time of the morning, you see, it is a leetle mussy," pointing to the littered-up con- difion of the little door-yards and streets, where withered flowers and sundries had been cast out, but where brooms were already active. "In another Ilour it'll be all right, you. see. " "I see. The village is making up its beds, inside and out."Frank pointed to a geontle- man wlio wans sticking frecsh China-asters, into his little flowcr-garden for the day; whiile the %witicred ones of yesterday lay' in a faded mass at his feet. "Just so. You and Ibad towash up when molrningr came, and the whole place does the same. But it gets tip its clean face pretty car- Iy and it keeps it aftelrwards all day. Daily spiritual renewing is just about as necessary, I take it. I[ hope you'll be at the meetings." So they parted, Frank indulging in at little private wonder as to whcther this man had slept in one of the great tents, or in a more home- likel if less hospitable, family dwelling. If twen. ty years of tent experience came out so jovially, there must be a great deal, after all, in getting used to it. Frank's spirits bad revived with fircsh air and conversation; but by the time lie had wandered over the inclosed grounds and out along the shore, be stood looliinF: idly off upon the ocean, with a homesick feeling for their own quiet beach. -'I have really had enough of it," be said aloud, in a tone of sudden weariness ; " and if Margaret is willing, we'll start for home this morning. 7) Margaret was willing. The camp - ground, haunted as it was now by the frowning face of Alfred Brand, was not attractive to her. "It is going to be a very hot day,"Fracnk bad    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5826-00000047"/> represented; 11 and if we are to drive home at all to-day, we should start at once." "I'm quite ready, Mr. Frank," was Marga-- ret's cheerful reply; "Lbut there may be need of a little coaxing to persuade Miss Fannie." "I'll promise her a new jackknife. She has been wanting one to whittle with because Mid- get has one. That will satisfy her; and if she don't cut -off every one of her nine digits in us- ing it, we may be glad, I suppose." So after coffee, beefsteak, and an ice-cream at a restaurant, while it was yet so early that Al- fredl was still debating within himself whether or not he might venture to call, Frrank, Marga. ret, and Fatnnie turned their faces homeward. The others remained at the camp-ground till the close of the meeting. Starting in the morning, as they did, of course our homeward-bound party met half the island- ers en route for camp-meeting, often with lum- bering vehicles heavily loaded; and Frank, with his light carriage, was forced to dash pell-mell into the scraggy oak bushes something like forty times before he bad the good-fortune to -leave the long, single-track, wooded island road be- hind him. The sun beat down on them piti- lessl Y7, the sea-air couldn't get into the thicket to relieve them, and the good -temper of 'the whole party was in a very melted state, indeed, before they reached home. "This is p,2ying5 for pleasure at a dollar a peck for small potatoes, I take it," said Frank, trying to laugh. II It's' a gold dollar, then, at the highest war value, I think," said Margiaret. "Fannie has earned her jackknife, at any rate. I'll stop on our way through New Town and buy it. Here's a good stick to begin upon, Ftan. II1I break it off now before we leave the woods, and you can begin to whittle away at once, for diversion. A hack or two into your fingers will be so much. the more lively, 6h, clhick?" "If I am a chick, I'm as tired as the old mother-hen was after -she had been sitting on her eggs for three weeks, 9 said the child, yawn- ing wearily. "I never want to go to camp- meeting again." It Oh, you'll forget all about this tiresome ride  an hour after we are at home, 9 said Margaret, comfortingly  bub t you'll remember sell the pleasant things at the camp-ground as ]on,- as you live; and your mamma will like to hear about it." "A comfortable theorv, Margaret," said Frank, snapping his whip and his fingers at the same time.   I "Yes, andat true one. Measure always itis a sunshine in it -which prints a pleasant dagnerre. otyp6: on the mind; but pain fades away like a I shadow, till the little trace that is left of it is pleasant also." LI believe you are half right." "Oh yes, so do I! I've got ever so much to tell Mamma, haven't 1?" said the child with sudden animation; " and Midget will almost wish she had come too." "Well, for one, while we stay in these R,,rts, I shall stick to our end of the island with the grip ofa lobster. I've taken enough of change and society at a single dose to last me till we go-back to Boston." "Itoo. I shouldn't be sorry, Mr. Frank, if we rall went to-morrow."Margaralet said this wearily; and her face had ae pallid, saddened lookr, which spoke More forcibly tha'n her words. I 4You!" cried Frank, with a, sudden, ques. tioning look. "What's happened now?'  I thought you liked it here." Margaret's face grew a double-dyed red, as she answered: "A baking ride at midday has happened, I suppose. Just at present, that eenis to me to', be about enough." 16 Well, I am bound to say, thougkL that this is the flrst hot ride we have had this summer, Margaret. There's always a cool breeze around the home hills. Hurrah for our Qiiitzee, for- ever! Now we are out of the desert, let us take courage." 16 Margarert will like her dlaguerreotypes when we get home, as well as any one of us, won't she 3 Of course., Almost every story is just a tangle of perplexities, up to the lqt end of it; and 'then it generally gets unravelled, and comes out-straight," said Frank, with a blun- decringi idea that something was wrong, and he would like to hint that it was possible to get it righted. Then he drov-, on, silently taxing  his heated brains, to no purpose, to imagine what it could be; and finally lie gave it up al- togethor. They purchased the jackknife, and reached home with hungjry appetites, to the immense satisfaction of the parents, who had -been dili- gently planting forebodings of very undesirable civilities on the part of their ohrly son, which withered aind perished utterly under the sun-' shine of his re-appearance two days before lie was expected. Totulm, left behind on the camp- ground, began to be a vel'y pleasant and pretty girl, in their genial thoughts.  The real Totum, and her party, who were well hotised and cheerfully entertained where   they were, enjoyed all the charmihg vairiety' which befell them to the end; and even came home again on the next cool Monday evening with a little unsatisfied longing for more change and novelty. The religious services were con- sidered to be highly satisfactory, and the gen- eral cheerfulness of all the attending circumstan. ces pre-eminently so. "A single bill of corn won't always do well in a garden all by itself," was the captain's genial comment-; " it wants a whole corn-field round about it sometimes, just for sociability's sake. - I find that old blood and young blood both begin to race through the veins a little more briskly for coming into company where everyy body is alive.` In the evening the voice of cheerful singing was again beard in the streets at the camp- ground, and ai crowd of people were once more di-awn to the melody, as inevitably as a packet ofsteel needles will run up and cluster about a powclful neighboring magnet. Alfred Brand was hero, with the others. He bad been sitting R11 day alone in his sloop, steeped to the eye- lids in the wormwood of regret. At night lie ventured out, under cover of the darkness, only   'to be drawn, moth-like, to a light- and harmony which left him moire scathed rand blackened, in his own esteem, than ever before. He was forced to remain at the carmpground, luch aarainst his will, to convey their passengers back again to Boston. In any event, more than a week must elapse before he could see Margaret and confess his folly. The one hope of her final forgiveness had a good deal of sustaining force in it; but his exacting nature still found itself in a perpetual warfare with a host of tor-- mentin-r doubts. The music, sweet and pene- trating as it was, had a sting in it for him, which no one else in the whole gay throng could in the least appreciate. The singers, grouped this evening in front of a handsome building, were serenading a dis- tinguisbed guest whom the people of the camp- grounds and of the nation alike delight to lion- or. Every one, thererfore, became even more eaaer to see than to hear. A fine-looking, tall man, still scarcely past the prime of life, step- ped out into the balcony, in acknowledgment of the courtesy, and was greeted with deep and wide-spread murmursof satisfaction. It was the Chiief-Justice of the United States.   CHAPFTER XXIL: FRANK AND MrR. DENNIS ON THE RAMPAGE.   "PUTIe up a luncheon, Margaret--quick7 pleanse! I don't care what it is, but enough for two. I shall be out all day, and I expect we Shall hav% to dine in another of Captain Giles's Greenwood hotels." Frank was hurrying here and there for his "4i, his handkerchief, itnd his thin coat, glane- ing out of everyI window, as he passed it, at Mr. Dennis, who sat outside, mounted on horseback, and patiently waiting for him.,, "The man don't look as thotigh you need hurry yourself, my son. Why didn't lie appoint an hour for starting?" Beca3ccuse he warsn't certain what time be could get off, mother, and so he agreed to come for me as he has." "But why do you engage to go with such a man atalll? Your father and Iare both annoyed at your falling into such company." "Why, mother, he is the most entertaining man on the island - next to Captain Giles. Besides, is it quite worth while to trouW a bout -it, when you know we shall all' be away for goodl in another fortnight. or two?"   "But I don't understand, Frank, how you can possibly endure the society of such a per-. son, even once, for a whole day together. Ile always looks so outlandish, and too shiftless even to move like other people. Hl is a per- feet figure of fun as he sits there on horse- back." "Well, it's the fun I'm after, if that's' worth any thing," said Franki, bursting into a, laugh, andkissingher. "Good-bye, motherdear. It's all right." 9 9I do wonder that Firank canl court the so- ciety of such a person," said Mrs. Warner, turn- ing to her husband as her son left her. "Yes. Yes. After all, my dear, it strikes me that there may be rather less danger in it than in excursionizing with some other perhaps more objectionable parties. He seems to be a queer flo divided up about equally into fisherman, farmer, and ne'er-do-weel; but there never is a great deal of barm, in that sty'a of man, and I suppose the boy finds him a novelty." "Fisb2 flesh, and fowl, all in a general bash," suggested Malfrgaret. ' If Mr. FIrank likes the    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5826-00000048"/> flavor of it, I shouldn't say it was unwholesome, Mr1s. WTarner." The mother accepted their suggestions with a smile of consolation-, wisely reflecting' that every thing in life has its compensations. All this time Mr. Dennis sat. outside the win- dow on his borse, lounging forward upon the neck of the animal with the most easy and un- hurried complacency. He really did look like a picket-guard of the corn-field proposing to join the cavalry service, and his high-bonedt nag was every way, worthy of Iris rider. Frank sprang ttpon his own borse with a flourish, and sat very upright as lie rode out of the yard, taking the lead at the right of his lop- sided confrere. "Fairly out for a day's sport, oh, Mr. Dennis?" Bound first to climb up to the highest point on the island, where %ve can study the original fashions of things, and then down to the work- shops, where they turn out the artificials," an- swerediMr. Dennig. "SIport! Ouglattobeethe primest school, to any man who ain't a fool." "But you don't ob ect to the jollity thrown in, I suppose 3 "Bless you, no; let's live as, we go."  Frank, taking him at his word, went career- ing about Mr. Dennis and his astonished old plodder two or three times-on a jaunty trot, by way of a first expenditure of some of the bottled- np energy of both himkelf and his horse.  It is not necessary to keep, step, I suppose T' "Not a bit of it. Of course 'not. FLirisk about at your case, whenever you please." "Cougli, laugli, 'or sneeze, cat bread and clicese, or outroar the breeze with sueb rl-tymes its these) 9 echoed Frank, bringing up sudden- ly, when horse and rider were both out of breath. "Give your orange a squeeze, I'll suek mine at my, 'ease," quietly moralized the inveterate rhyms ier, patting the neck of his staid anirnal with approval. "Do you expect to live and die on this island, Mr. Dernis?" "I don't calculate on any't thingg else, young man. I'm not one to desert an old friend. Naked came I out of this sand-pit, and naked shall I: return to it again, beyond a doubt." The philosopher took hold of his thinnest of old linen coats with a shake, and kicked out his wide, lank trowsers with a chuckle, indicat- ing that be was but one degree removed from that primitive condition already.  "I colildn't lenrn to breathe withoutr plenty of salt and moisture mingled together in every breath of   L(No, I don't believe you ever could  laughed Frank; and so they went on their wa Y, taing merry and wise counsel together. The fenced road was soon left behind; and, entering grassy fields through gate-ways and bars, they wandered along the by-paths, 'where sheep-pastures, blackberries, or hazel-nnts line the road-sides, and finally off over roadless farms, with heavy open-work stone necklaces hanging like massive ornaments upon the come- ly broald shouldclrs of almost every hill--on and up till they are upon the top of breezy Mount Prospect. "Considerable of a bIill in tire mounting, but nothing to speak of as a Motcntain?  was Mr. Dennis's comment; but lie sat t'efy upright on hris horse, and lookctl out from under' his slouched hat, with a lighting up of the face, which made another manl of him, for a inoment, in FIrank's eyes, wtho looked at hini with even more interest than ant the wide and pleasant landscape. The view W'ould have paid for three times as muchi climbing tis they ]iad been troubled witii. It widened out on all sides over a, rolling green surface, edged with silver, which spread, un- equal in width, nearly around the whole bo- rizon, sometimes winding in and out among little islands and peninsulas, and -Variedi here and there with ai rich embroidery of masts and sails. Even where there was no water visible, strips welre seen I'caching: up over the hills, their tall riggiing relieved against the catlmer blue -of the sky. Neither Frank nor Mirl. Decnnis were i-catdy to leave till their eves were reddecned by tile wind and half blinded withi sunshine, though both their horses sniffed the air disdlainfully, pricking up their cars, switching their tails, and\ dancin(- a four-footed duet together in continual Protest. II Evidently horses don't care about getting veryY near to heaven," was-Frank' cornment as they rode down on the sido tow-ardss the shore, where the quiet waters of the bay were inviting- ly suggestive of pleasant swimming. "Now, if I had my %wishes, we Should both turn into fisher,;" was Mr. Dennis s rather am- biguous remark, emphasized by pointing out to- wards the tempting water. II Agreedd" said Frank;,- laconically. "But what's to become of the horses?" "Let them stay horses' here in the clover." "But will they stay P i"Certain." Theire's nothing here to the them to--not so much as a stone." "Tie their heads to their feet; the gnriss   is always sweet; let them walk about and eat."  , Tliat's one way of cribbing a lunch, espe- cially as we haven't brought -them any in our pockets. " it It's all accordin' to the laws and customs of the island. A horse here is always welcome to his bite; I suppose, because it takes a good while to get it in places where grass is one half stlrawherry -vines and t'other half huckleber- ries-)l Tbey dismounted, and, after fettering their horses, went on towards the sliore. A bath on a warm day is delightful to every one; but it is only a good swimmer who knows liow to enjoy it as an utmost luxury. Fran4g hlad been at home in the water from his child- ]food; but his proficiency in swimming, com- pared with the superb acquirements of Mr. Dennis, was like the walking of an ordinary good pedestrian to the hundred-mile capabilities of Mr.' Weston. No sooner did this easy-going )ianger-on upon the energy of Providence once dip b is sprawling, lank body into the water, than he was clothed upon with a garment of strength aind personal endeavor. The man was a swimmer wholly and simply upon his own re- sponsibility. All his awkwardness was trans- formed to case and grace of novernent. He struck out with a freedom and vigor which astonished his admiring spectator, while his own enthusiasm seemed unflagging and unwea. ried. Loing after Frank found Iiimself com- pletely exhaustedl, Mr. Dennis still swam to and fro, as if lie were merely resting and refreshing biimself in his own native element. "How did you learn to do it so well?" asked Frank, with an involuntary, new respect in the very tones of his voice. "Brouglitup in thowaiter, you know. There's a capital pond just back of our house."   "Yo like it, too. One can acc that it suits YOU."' "Certain. Things never go criss -cross or get knotted, up in a tangle that I feel I've -no business to untie, that I don't jump into the water and swim clean away from the whole of it. I tell you, I have washed off a, great many troubles in my day, and, generally, they sink down under me as if I'd taken 'em into the wa- ter with millstones about their necks." "But why do you think you have no business to untie any tangle, however knotty it is?" "Well, you see, I look at it in this %way. I've no cause to murmur because this is rather a hot day, have 1?" "No."   "(And it's best to take in jest as much of this stiff little breeze, that God sends to refresh us, as ever I can cleverly without overdoingit?" r  "Yes." "Well, that's about the whole of it. I don't make ttlings. I just take 'em, good and bad together. When the dust is blowing in myv face, I shut my eyes and don't breathe bard till it goes over; but I don't feel any call to fret, and strive, and try to blow the dust away; for I can't do it if I would. I always have befieved7 onthe whole, that it was best to follow the lead of Providence-not to push against it." -   `i "But you jump into the water and swim away from trouble." "Well, yes; but that's not exactly the way to put it. What I am really swimming away from such times is jest nothing but myself--the stirred up part of me, yon know. I leave, that behind to settle, while I go off into clear water." "You really do go off, though, of your own free will, don't you?" "I'm afraid I do--in the water, you know; but not Inuch on land. You see there's a kind of baptism in it that makes me feel new-born evelrr time ; but it's only water -baptism, andl don't last. I'm generally, pretty reconciled, and ready enough to be led, on dry land." A sly glimmer in the balf-sbut eye of the lazy philosopher brought Frank to a' sudden stand-still in his inquiries. He was not dis- posed to be quizzed; and be comprehended that he was getting somewhere into the border-landl between fun and earnest, where Mr. Dennis most habitually abode. Mr. Dennis was lying at full length upon the' sand, tossing pebbles withliis left hand. "'Life is but dust. Meekly, in trust, let us drift as we must," he remarked; turning over upon the other side, and tossing pebbles with his right hand, all the time looking across the bay, where the little wave-crests were rising, and the tide was just turning also. The water came eddying up among the multi- tude of clean, shining pebbles along its edge, with a soothing, musical gurgle, which made it very easy to be reconciled to I unch and' idle set" possibly, even, to a noon-day nap, in a placeo so altogether comfortable; for some good-natured clouds had floated near, and were holding their light-brown umbrellas over the heads of the contented idlers. M. Dennis, after his vigorous experience in the water, was as limp and paradisiacal in mood as a man who has just comre from, a genuine Turkish bath, and equally disposed to indulge in the pipe of peace and reverie. He brought    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5826-00000049"/> out a meerschaum, curious and home-made like himself--the bowls a handsome andwell-turned "boat-shell," and the stem a stout, hollow reed, which he had prepared for the purpose. He had found the shell lying upon the shore, a hole already worn in the closed end of it, and had at once accepted its suggestion of availability. It answered its design famously; light, puffy wreaths of smoke were now lifting themselves slowly upward every moment, and floating out to sea on the wings of each wandering zephyr. 6 6 Life is a puff, of smoky, light stuff'; it's tile vapor of snuff," drawled Frank, after watching the interesting operation' attentively, and spend- ing a few moments in getting his rhymes nicely fitted. "Young! man, you're a trump!" observed IMr. Dennis, rising up on his elbow, andE'looking ap. preciatively into the face of hi's companion. "I'm a good deal too sleepy to be that," said Frank, sinking back leisurely upon a sand-pil- low which he had been patting up to convenient height, indifferent as to its softness; and they both subsided into meditations, or dream-latnd, as the case might be. Whether Mr. Dennis would have gone on smoking there contentedly till night, it is im. possible to sayj for Frank was an inciting prov- idence, poiinting out to him that there wans a brick-yard and a paint-mill yet to be visited that afternoon. II I'm quite; ready," wag his prompt answer. A little less briskly he propped himself up- first with his bands and afterwards with his legs --till at the third move he stood upriollt and in walking order. The tethered horses were conveniently in waiting, and much refreshed, like their masters; for, apparently, they had not only dined, but, having'no tobacco-pipes to console them, had slept also in -the three hours' interval of rest. "First to the brick-kiln, then to the paint- mill! Charge, Warner, charge! Down the nearest hill;" and away they-went, neck and neck, in pell-mell haste, to atone for lost time-- Mr. Dennis clucking like a mother-hen, slapping the bridle, and kicking rat the sides` of his beast in an unwonted excitement which the horse found to be highly contagious. A brick-yard, 'withits huge utilitarian piles of red baked clay, all squared, lengthened, and shortened to one pattern, till they are as much alike as an even row of peas grown in the same pod, is by no means a picturesqure visiting- ground; yet when you study the orderly process of manunfacture--when you look into the long, low blrick tunnel glowing with fervetlt heat, and   'sending up its potent influences through a thou- sand curiously-devised crevices to the topmost brick in the structure, you are at at loss wheth- er to admire most the: clear prevision of mind, or the blind urgency of might. It was all new and entertaining to a young man who bad been business-bonnd from his childhood; and Frank was also glad to meet the fair-spoken, white- bearded, city-bred youth who superintended'af.- fairs here, and who seemed even more pleased with the visit; and the fresh reminder whictl it brought with it of hlalf-forgotten young -people at home. "Youth is aye blithe to look-in the face of its equal."I The paint-mill, a mile or two farther on, is interesting also in its way, grinding as it does the various shades of ochreo'us earth ; inter- esting, moreover, from the self-written history of its raw material, so closely associatedl with the whole pre-historic ages. This modest isl- and makes a very good magazine and work- shop for the hustling world from which, it is exiled. But in this neighborhood we-re qlniet, Ia'wn- like, exceedingly picturesque grounds, varied in surface, shaded with many handsome varieties of trees, and beautiful with the effect of closelv- shaven grass. Ilere, looking down "' the wood. land aisles, " might be seen the gleam or water whose great sheet laly spread out gloriously upon one side of you ; and yet all this is the result of Nature's own Untaught landscape -gardening, very little improved in any way by the cultiva- tion of man. Tilis was a surprise greater and pleasanter than any other to Frank, who bad Ilitherto supposed beatlty of shrubbery to be among the lost arts of the dwarfed old Dame Natu re who presides over the well-being of this outlawed small fraction of the world. "Tidss is the best thing on the island, Mr. Dennis," lie said, emphatically. They were both inclined to linger here, until Prudence was become imperative in her sugges- tions of the necessity for returning without de- lay. Mr. Dennis's horse was immemurambly astonished, on the return trip, at the. exceeding Urgency of his master, which infected him to an extent Zwholly witho tpeeen nhs whole eqluine experience. In reality, the brother was unwilling to disturb the cheerfulness of the pending evening meal by any unusual delay.. He knew that his tea- was alwa s made at a given time, and its flavor would not improve by standing, and neither would his punctual sister's equanimity. II Come borne with me and take supper. I 1,want you to see my better half; for my sister-,   is as much that to me as any other rpan's wife is to hiln. We're like a double cherlry that gre-w on the same stem ; but my half would han've dried up long ago, if she didn't keep hers always plump and fresh. I go without dinner qulite generally; but when supper-time cotnes,- if I'm not there,she can't enjoy ler own meail; - and that wears on me more than feasting. So I always calculate to be on band, and punctual, you see, at least once iii twenty-four hours. Every thing will be ready at the minute, and wer can make time yet to meet it, if we're tol- erable spry." This was Mr. Dennis's invitation, and Franks concluded to accept it. His sister was the per- I'etual home providence which kept every thing moving; and the brother appreciated her ac. cordingily. "She's the eye of the needle,' Rnd,'l am the Point that's pushed forward," be said, in spealk- in,, of hier afterwards. "She carries the thread,   and keeps every thing in general about the housestitched together, and in good repair-- done-principally by means of pushling me on at the right time; for, you see, I gness she's the thimble to6, and the ' power behind the thimble. You'll see for yourself bow it is." Miss Jedida Dennis proved to be a pleasant, home-like little body of fiftyj-five, trim, bright, and thrifty from top to toe, and in all her sur. roundings--her only brother excepted. They met her coming out of the house, with a plrite and knife in her hand, on her way to the cellar, which was entered from the outside by a double lean-to door, reclining against the side of the Louse in an inclined plane. She received them cordially, turning back to see them seated in her tidy kitchen, where the tea-table was already spread in the cool corner by the open door, and, after a few inquiries after the events of the day, she went on with her almost completed supper- arrangements.    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5826-00000050"/> She had not anticipated a visitor. There were two covers upon the table, two easy-chairs sat facing each other in readiness for their oc- cupants, and two little tea-pots were standing side by side upon the small stove. Jedida liked her green tea, and couldn't do without it; Job preferred a t'ea which didn't look like dish- water, however it tasted. In two opposite open windows were two cats, each perched upon her own window-sill sleepily, and peacefully doz- ing on her own -account. As Frank noticed the funny little duplicate arrangement of every thing, his eye lighted with an involuntary smile.   uLo see every 'thing is married in this house except Jedida and I, said Mr. Dennis, r with tin appreciative od ; and as his sister re- turned at the moment, his face immediately elongated to a dignity which he knew she would consider appropriate to him- as master of the house. iMr. Dennis at home was apparently a good deal less eccentric than Mr. Dennis at large. They hadl a, social, quiet little supper, each of the three apparently enjoying it thoroughly-. It dwelt in Frarnk's memory afterwards as the shaded green evening of an unusually sunny and green day.   CHAPTER XXIII. MSCHIEF.   WimEN all the mornings are beautiful, it is almost invidious to make distinctions in favor of one which is pre-eminently lovely; yet such a morning there was at the sea-side, charming beyond all off its predecessors-a new day worthy to have been sent down fresh from Paradise to gladden the childrent of men. It would hardly be possible to tell why this morning was note- worthy above all that had preceded it, though it had a wonderful transparency of atmosphere. Can any one say why the tender green of spring is more delightful than the withered brown of late autumn? why there is beauty in a strain of music? or even why honey is pleasanter to us than wormwood?3 This was a day which brought every thing into closer relations than ever before, as though space itself had been literally annihilated ;it tinted sea, earth, and sky with a fresh coloring, and it made the human pulse beat a little faster, and the heart throb with a new vigyor and hap- piness; but it also stirred up the latent firn and mischief sleeping somewhere in. the demure spirit of a young girl who had been for a long time now upon her good behavior. Totum and Midgeit had gone'out together veryv early to the shore, and when they had frolicked with the waves, tossing pebbles back into the sea with laughter and handclapping, there was still effervescence enough for some- thing more. Midget went dancing off, midge. like, hardly certain herself whether she was on the sands or in the air; but Totum sat and pon. dered, her face dimpling with smiles, and her eye, turned cliff-ward. Directly she clambered   up nearly to the top of the bank, a strongf little sand-spade in hand, and set vigorously to work undernrining the brow of the cliff, her face flushed, and her eye gleaming with anticipatedt satisfaction. This was the, point where Frank Warner gen. erally came down upon the sands. YLoung: man like, he scorned the more beaten path ; and as no one else was -generathy in the mood for risk- ing a broken neck by a descent at an angle of forty- five degrees, he had appropriated the place to tlimself, and established a private pathway of his own. (f course, Totum was intent upo - diggiing an innocent pitfall for his unwary feet. The cliff just here was unusually loose and sandy, yet it was packed sufficiently to allow a large cavity to be judiciously dug out from be- low, in suich a way as to be quite conceclcd to the eve, looking down from above. Totum' worked with a will for a good half-hour, her checks glorying beautifully with the unwonted exertion, and every pulse responsive to the wholesome exercise. The great sea-fan was always wafting her coolness and courage, and she worked on thinking of nothing but the mer- riment there would be in seeing Frank's sur- prised tumble into the nice sand-beap which she was preparing for him below, and in heai- ing his naive comments as to bow it could pos- sibly have happened. Every now and then M\Iidget came back, as heavily laden with treas- ures as it honev-bee whlen the clover-fields are all in blossorn, and a little colloquy would en- sue. "What are you doing, Toturn?   ;Digging." W'Chat, for?" "Alaking a nice little cave up here in the Cliff. " "What are you going to do with it?" "I should like to get the sand-malrtins to cuine and buzild2 in here. - Wouldn't it be nice?" B1]ut they won't coine, Totum. You arena' making it a bit like at satnd-mairtin bank! No little animal would ever go into such a great ugly hole as that." "'Never mind! You'll see." Then Midget would flit off again on another foraging expedition, Totum working on with at little laugh alternated with snatches of song. Her gay voice might have been heard a good ivay off anywhere except upon the sea-shore, where old Ocean himself has an almost undis. puted monopoly of sound. There it is gener- ally quite safe to be noisy, and, if you can, light-hearted.  Sometimes a little rivulet of loosened sand from above would come flowing down of its own accord, helping or hindering: Totum's work, as the case might be; and at last, when she was afraid that the whole roof to her grotto would come tumbling down on liar head, she desisted from her employment, sweating herself upon a great stone on the beacB, to wait for the result. "Is it all done now, Totum T' asked Aidget, coming back to her sister with? an immense slab of porous water-soaked cork, which she had found washed up on, the shore, L See, I have foundl this! Fannie and I can whittle all sorts of things out of it, that will be ever so nice, can't we?"' Yes," "Yes whatP about the digging up there, or aIbout this nice piece of cork to whittle things O1it of T' B oth." Whatt did you dig it for really, then, To- turn?" II For exercise and-funn," lingering with a slow conscientious earnestness upon the last reason, which the little eager questioner drew out from her in spite of herself. F'Erank  Warner comes down there some-  times.  "CDoes he?"                4 Frank Warner is -the very sand-martin you were trying to catch, Totum Giles!" said Mid-I get. leaning her precious cork against t he side of the rock where her sister was seated ; and,  Testing her two little empty hands comfortably  upon  hier hips, like a shrewd little old woman,I   she faced Rituni, with a steady, penetrating stare. The youngnc lady laughed, rrand turned off with affected carelessness. 'Do you want to get' Frank for your beau, Totutn?"Midget asked, suddenly, withi the in- nocent directness of her seven-year's experience. "Of course I don't!" answered Totum, in-  t dignantly, reddening more than ever, down to 3 the tips of all her fingers and toes. "'What t has that to do with digging a hole in the sand, I should like to know?" "I[ don't think he will get hurt, if it does cave in when lie is coming down there," contin., iued Midget, as if thinking aloud; looking off towards, tie bank now, with her great, ques- Itioning eyes; 11 but, if you don't want him for a beau, then I don't See what you do it for." Toturn startled the child by bursting into at merry but vrexed laugh. IIWhat has that to do witil it, you dear little gosling? Don't see any connection between wanting to have a lit- tle fun and wanting - wanting - any thing else."She stammered, suddenly ashamed in her own heart, lest the two things might pos- sibly be connected together, in the ;nind of some one else. Midget looked at her more steadily than ever, till the young lady felt that the sharp little eyes were like two probes. II There's Fanny coming, Midget; and Mol- O1h, Z am so glad I Where's the cork." The little face was shining now with great glee, and the, mistress of the jackknife scampered off in taste to join her friends. It was concluded, as, Molly'was Ilere to play, that the others would forego the pleasure of whittling for the present, and indulge first in a game of hide-and-seek. The three children might have been seen for the next fifteen min- utes alternately subsiding and rushing about in a wild frenzy--now crouebing behind a great boulder, or hiding in some cleft of the bank, and then flying in, hot, haste along the beach with their faces turned backward half the time, to see if the others were looking; while every other moment a fine little treble whoop rang out from some niche or cranny, making itself heard above the monotone of the ocean-at; a flute would call attention to itself in the midst of a dozen heavy bass drums. But TIotum. neither saw nor heard. I don't know what she was thinking about while she sat there, motionless, the red heat slowly cool- ing: off in her pleasantt face, and with it, the mirth and mischief both dying out also from her look; but in' the midst of it all, she kept a    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5826-00000051"/> general, half-conscious watch of -the bank where she bad dug her pitfall. Suddenly she started up in'dismay. Molly had found the tempting excavation, and was abiding there; and just at the same moment, Mr. and Mrs. Warner, finding themselves unu- 311ally buoyant with the invigorating atmos- phere, Ilad concluded to shorten the way to the shore, by making the descent together along Frank's foot-path.- Totum shouted, and threw up her hands with a distressed cry; but the gentleman and ladyv had already stepped out upon the brink; tile treacherous mass crumbled under their feet, and they suddenly found themselves clinging togeth- er, terrified, half buried in a sand-heap several feet lower down. But where was Molly? Totum, with a face as white as the sea-foam behind her, rushed wildly up the bank, and began digging fran-tic- ally into the debris, trying in vain to utter a sound, for her voice- had failed2 her entirely.  Another moment, and the sands themselves seemed to be helpin'. The sturdy little pris- oner underneath was struggling to free her- self; thrusting out so vigorously towalrds the open air, that Totum, lifted suddenly from her feet, was sent rolling helplessly down the cliff, never stopping till she bad tumbled out upon the hard beach a long way below. Molly's headc emerged, gaspingi for breath; and Frank and Captain Giles, who had been following slow. ly in the footsteps of Mr. and Mrs. Warner, came up just in time to look down upon the scene below.' There was Totum at the base, hastily pick-- ing herself up-as red now as,she Iiad I)Cell white a moment since; but looking immensely relieved when she glared up at little Molly, wlio was shakingi the sand fromr her hair, and spit- ting it out of her mouth still with desperate en- ergy, .Mr. and Mrs. Warner were sitting to- gether half-way down the cliff, each half bu- rlied in the sand, and both apparently unable or afranid to move. SHow did it all happen?" asked Captain Giles, dragging Molly out firom the hill in whiichi she was standing, still nearly buried. Frank sprang to the aid of his father andl another. Every body was soon landed upon the smooth level below; Molly, who had been dlreadfully frighltened and haff stifled, rapidly recovering. She had been hlidinlg, rolled up on her hands and knees like a ball, and the main bodty of the little avalanche, carqving iMr. and Mrs. Warner, had slid past her ant fallen down below, so that she was neither bruised nor seri-   onlsly injured; and no one else bid- suffered, except the little mischief -maker herself, who was much too wise to complain to the others of the multitudee of ugly bumps with which she was battered from top to toe. The captain's question was unanswered. "How did it happen, father T" echoed Frank, when they had stood looking into each other's faces for another minute. "I don't know, my son. Your mother and I were walking down the bank exactly as I have seen you do a hundred times, when it all gave way suddenly-; but how little Molly got buried up in there, entirely above us as we fell, I can't imagine." There was a great hole, aaid I onlyi went in there to hide," explained Molly, half crying. "A great hole!" exclainied several voices in various tones of surprise ; and the children were seen running up withi eager curiosity to learn what it was all about. Totum  was desper- ate. "Oh! I had just been digging in the bank for the benefit of the sand-martins, 1 she said, inno- cently. - III suppose the earth must have been disturbed, and loosened up a little."She avoitl- ed Frank's eve; hut lie understood the whole matter at once,- nild ris quick laugh rang out for a Inoment with delightful clearness.  II Let's see! is this the first of April, or Sep. tember? Whici is it?3 It is tlhc first of somic- thing, I am sure," lie said, gileefulllp. 'If it is the first practical joke, my son, then I tliink it will do very well for a beginning," saidi Mr.1 Warnecr, good-nattiredly. Ile' laid his aris- tocratic hand upon Tottim's, shoulder, with a lit- tle aplproving: caress. As no one was hulrt veryS much, lie could afford to be pleasant over it, and the p"'ctty, blushing girl, who had been punish- ed enough already for her intended mischief, hand really almost won his beart. He had lifted an immense weight firom Tottim -one which had seemed to her, a moment before, to be heavier than the whole san-cliff. She bad fully exlpected to meet his intense displeasure ; and, indeed, every one else was agrleeably sur- prised that he accepted the incident kindll-, l' patently without any sense of Iruffled dignity. Thaltt, alsolwas one of the virt 'tes to be attrib- ulted to the unparalleled excellence of the fine 'dayV, stimulating every body to unwonted good- nature. Two months before, it is plreshmet that Totum would have been crossed out of hiis lbook of remembrance with very little ceremony indeed, if site Ilad been guilty of any thing re- suiting so untowardly to biniself, thouglr with- out intending it. The wholesome tonic, sea-air,   bad strenrrthened the nerves of his equanimity very' much indeed meantime. Gentle Mrs. Warner felt much more dissatis- faction than her husband. Somehow all this aroused the old feeling of maternal solicitude for her boy. Midget's association of ideas crept into her head also. IIf this young lady was not planning a hidden metaphorical snlare for tile young man who had already escaped a tum. ble only because his own father and mother had providentiallly stepped in as the scape-goat for the occasipn7 then what had site done it for?" Tile indignant lady seated herself moodily at little way off, with thoughts more unquiet than the eternal toss and surge of the waters at her feet--looking calmly out at sea, but heartily wishing they were all -safely out of the island, with its increasingly dangerous pitfalls. Little by3 little her husband was infected by the same thought and the two sat talking it over in low tolles. But till the others, after a good laugh, bad gone down into the sea, and well-nigh washed awray all thought of the morning's adventulre al- together, unless it might be supposed to bubble up) now and then to the surface in joke and mer-- riment, its influence remaining as the perpetuzl nucleus for merry gibes, pushes, and pinches, withl intent to upset and startle somebodyv among the children, and in a good-natured, cheerful ban- tcl' among all the young people and the old cap- tain. There certainly was a sudden budding out of a new spirit of teasing, with which all the young! folks seemed to be simultaneously inoc- ulated. Frank and Totum. never went back again quite to the old, even level of placid, kindly fel- lowship,. lIenceforththere wasaRlwaysall Lmer- ryr thought " to be broken between them, and a -renrctly qluickened sparring of wit, thougll Totum ttlought it veryr hard that all this should be the result of one innocent, girlish prank, which re- ally meant exactly nbthi g: at all, but to ' hich everyv one seemed determined to attachl some mysterious import. Pre'sently the, attention of the whole party was drawn towards Anne and Margarret, who were standing upon the high banks in the dis- tance, looking downn townlrds the party below. ,rhere was also a large flock 'of sleep quietly feeding up there, every one of them standing out distinctly against the sky, and making al-  together a very Ipleasannt pastoral tableaus Anne drew out her handkerchief, and began waving it to-wards her frieniis. The sheep -topped grazing, and looked intently. Then an oldl bellw-evther made a sudden dash for- i   ward; in a moment lie stood on the brow of the cliff, and every body uttered a suppressed 'cry ; but Idown be came, threading his way along a foot'-path which evidently he had trodden be- fore, followed by the whole flock at a rapid run, one- behind another, looking like an impetuous winding stream filled with white boulders, which were suddenly coming down in a torrent from the heights above. Then the whole troop were seen scattered along the broad beach in' the dis- tance, walking about as serenely undisturbed as though nothing at all unusual had happened to thiem. II The most wonderful thing I ever saw in my life!" exclaimed Mr. Warner, Speaking with the rapid pleasurable excitement which they all felt. I IThey are equal to anymountain-goats. Here. after I shall eat my mutton with the feeling that it has all turned to venison under the good in- fluence of sea-air. It is really wonderful! I -thought they would all tumble headlong and Perish."' Anne aind Margaret were evidently frightened at the thought of the possible mischief which they had caused so undesignedly, for they were seen hurrying along, stopping now and then to look down incredulously upon the innocent sheep below, as though they were not at all certain that. they were all safe, or could possibly ever get back again over the same path, into the pas- ture above. But soon there appeared other actors upon the scene. Two men were observed driving down to the shore in a farm-wagon, creeping slowly along one of the beaten tracks through a rift in the sand-knolls, and coining out upon the shore midwavv between our party of friends and the slicep in the distance. On they went along the packed sand, two wheels almost Eclw'ays in the water, and the others wet every now and then by the splash of the waves, the wise, elderly horses evidently enjoying their pleasant foot- bath in the sea with all the relish which they must have felt in their more -eager youth. Finally, halting at a point where there was an accumulation of sea - wed, the men began to gather this Into the cart, The sheep had all stood looking at them with great deliberation for some minutes. Now the sturdy old leader turned about with some little show of indignation, and then quietly be- gan his a 'seent, winding up and up along the jagged face of the cliff, as he had come down, more slowly to be sure, but Vith ,equal spirit and Aetermlinatiorn. A-11 tihe rest followed with discreet order, the reversed stream of boulders, or possibly masses of rounded white foam, ap-    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5826-00000052"/> parently flowing upward in defiance of all the laws of gravity, producing even a more novel effect than before. When the last one stood out triumphantly again upon the carpet; of green herbage, Frasnk sprang forward flourishing his hat, and calling    'for three cheers; and the three cheers were giv- en with a will, making the workryien turn round with open mouths, and wonder what in the world was goingforward almon-r that do-nothingn party oOf idllers to cause this sudden outhurst of r'ejoicing.   CHAPTER XXIIV. THE CAPTAIN 7S DINNER-PARTY.   II Dox'T YOU think, Miss Giles, it would beI ,civil to ask the whole Boston family over here' to dinner some day? It would be a pleasant thing, too; for both our children." "I think so; but it wouldn't quite do as you plan it, capting, because we take tea at just their dinner -hour, and I couldn't fix up any thing hearty enough;i but our dinner might be made about equal to their lunch, if we choose to send 'em, an invitation to that." "I expect it might, Miss Giles. You don't calculate I shall give in that your cookery isn't about equal to any body's, I hope. 4but I guess your plan is best, and I'll get one of the Indian girls over here to help for a week." IINot a bit of need of that. I can doo` it all easily; and Totum. has a knack at most things, and is willing to help." "Know; but let the child have a real play. dav. And I don't want to add -an ounce to your shoulders; geems to me you would get to stoop a little if I: did."The captain, with one of his twinkles of satisfaction, glanced at the trim, upright little figure of his wife, who stood - polishing window-panes with a piece of chalmois leather. "Besides,, I spoke to Catrline Dakin yesterday, and shte said she could come any time. You see I wasn't going to propose the plan to you till I could see my way clear through' it y "Just like you, capting; first asking advice about the mowing, and- then owning up that you've got the hay all cut and dried, and want me to help you draw it in; but I'm: pretty well used to your wkys after sixty years. When is it to be?" "I'll go this morning to look for grouse and ducks. They'll do famously, won't they? and be island produce to be proud of, with our veg-  tables.  If the grouse turn up, we'll ask 'em  bright away"                 .  ` It's pretty early for young heath-fowl, ain't  I i cpn 3 Rather, I expect. The chiclks in ust be pret-    ty much grown and plump, after all; and if I have luck, it can be done. -I know their quar- tering-ground pretty well. I shall go alone, and likely bring down one old cock or so. You could make him tender, I guess 3 "Yes, easy enough. I'll bile him first, and then roast--the ducks too, if you get any." There are two or three of thern fishin a off on the water every day. They are easy shot. I could go out in the boat, if necessary, and pick ?cm up from the water-pond." The captain shouldered Iris gun, and mount- ed his horse, i-idin'g away into a back-hill neigh- borhood, where heath-fowl most do congregagte; and then, leaving the horse tied by a long tether to a stone, not too heavy to be dragged along slowly as lie grazed, the captain stole warily along on foot, and in less than two hours he had shot as many grouse as be desired.  W'ell, here's the backbone of a dinner, ducks or no ducks, meditated Captain Giles, eying his string of birds admiringly as he turn- ed back to hunt up his nibbling steed, who stood with cocked' ears, complacently waiting his ali- proach. The horse, evidently, would have met the' man half -way, except for the insulting stone against which his dignity bound him to protest. "Now, pony,") said the captain,, speaking to the animal confidentially, by way of reparation for any wrong, "I'll just invite Crapting Hezekliah. and his wife, and their MaryI, for there'll be enough for all. It will be strange if I don't find a duck or two before night, somehow, by- book or by crook. So trot on, pony--no time to lose;" and Pony, satisfied and forgiving, trot- ted away nimbly, a proud and sensib e horse. The dinner came off duly at -onjj 'lc-o the'third day, the invited guests be  a Ik-ofl pres- ent, Katrgalret excepted. Margaret  ate with the family at home on an occasion, lutn she bad' insight enough to understand that this, as a habit, would be trenching upon the family pri- vacy in a way which would be felt by some of   the members, who yet were not disposed to ban- ish her merely as an inferior. In the country, also they needed her services as waiting-girl ;,, but to serve at home, and be served abroad, struck her at--once as incongruous. It would be awk. ward either to sit at the first table or to wait for the second, so she promptly declined going; and pelrhaps every one was, on the whole, rather better satisfied with her and her decision than they' otherwise might bave been. Kindly Mrs. Giles, who bad rather dubiously hoped Margaret would enjoy herself if she came, and not be put out by ally one, brightened decidedly when she found that she would be at liberty to send a pair of fine heath-chicks, steaming hot, to Mar- garet and Molly at home. This question of rank and social position, in this country, wh-ere the lines are never closely drawn, is often more really troublesome and annoying than in the Old Wokd, with its more clearly-cut social dlis- tinctions. Captanin Giles had secured his brace of ducks, so that there was a superabundance of dainty wild meats. Every thing else was the best of its ktind, even to the unusually amiable spilrits of all the guests ; for the mood of the caters is even more important than the viands eaten, in determining the success of an entertainment. Carline Dakinu had inherited some of tile lbcst gifts of a cook as an heir-loom from n her Africain ancestry, and her Indian blood allied her sympathies with the wild game, which, as Captain Giles said, was the backbone of the dinner. She proved, therefore, a most efficient auxiliary in the kitchen. As Carline was wont- ed to the house, often coming to lend a hand on sundry occasions, it is a question whether or not this, dinner-party, with the extra washing of its best dishes and its modclrn silver spoons, didt really add an ounce of care to the super- -intecndingg dame. It certainly gave her many ounces of genuine, motherly satisfaction,.atnd her quiet days were as much burnished tip by it as were those of her quaint, aged coffee-urn, Whtich never even saw the light except on highh days and holidays; then it always underwent a beautifying witl; white powder, as many passed young ladies do before a presentation to com-- Vany. But perhaps -we have already lingered too Iong with the meats; wmd turn at once, with apol- ogy, to the ineeters, as one after another they are daily assembled. Captain Hezekiah and his family came first, and soon fell into ready con- verse--the two captains, the two matrons, and the two maidens entertaining each other in Pai'rs, while Midget tried to cultivate ears acute   "enough to follow three separate conversations at once; but failing in this) she gave her atten- ;:tion to the gentlemen, and we follow her exam. k ple. II Yoll see, poor, Mr. Warner, with all his bad t health, just takes bold of every thing in a kind ;of left-handed way, and it makes him seem as limp as a tow-string. I don't think he was ioriginallyr slack-twisted, but you see, one way and another, he has become a good deal frayed t 'out It's something the same with Mrs. War- t ner, for she always tries to keep step with her husband, and that's very weaning for any body." I "Do they improve in health by their sta?- here?" asked Captain H-ezekiab, who bad just Ireturned from a two months' absence from tile island. "I think they do; but Mr. Warner don' 3 sem to know it, if lie is any stronger." At this moment the -visitors, were seen ap- preaching  the door. Captain Giles went to meet theom, and Captain Hezekiah stood tip atld pulled down his waistcoat, which already fell ovel his rounded chest as smoothly as a pigeon's feather jacket is fitted to Iris skin. He had de- bated within his soul whether or not to keep on this gloves for the present, but lind thought bet. ter of it, and didn't. Howevecr, hris hands were as presentable as a gentleman's should be, and not in the least toil-stained like his cousin's. Air. Warner was much pleased with Caldfrin Hezekiairh, and the two held lpleasant converse together. "I haveC sometimesg thought life in a city would be richer and more ample than Ilere," said Captain Hezekiah ; "Lbut it is not easy to break up old axssociations, and I love the house where I was born. It Ilns merely been recmod- elled since I came into possession." I'Ah, well; surely there is much more, ili- terest in one's ancestral homestead than in, all the dozen houses wholch most city men lhnvo lived in during a lifetime. I am tempted to envyt any man who is owner of hiis birth-place." So, in all sincerity,, those twfo gentlemen ex- changed compliments, which were as mutually flattering and well' received as are the polite sayings of any two fine ladies who are trying to be agreeable from, the stand-point of a really amiable mood. Captain Giles realized for once that his grown- up guests were to be his fil'st consideration, though the young ones were not wholly forgot- ten; and his whole bearing, on this occasion, was that of a proper, well-mannered, elderly gentleman; though he still wore his old-fash. ioned best summer-coat.  11 e was steadily  po.    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5826-00000053"/> lite, but grave, merry, and genial by turns; so that the whole Warner family looked on with surprise, quite won by it; for to them it was tile old captain in a new light. Dear little Mrs. Giles, also, who always cooked and wash- ed in the every-day dress and manners of her giirlhood, took on the tone of modern society-- RS she had seen it chiefly in the houses of her children--with the same gentle acquiescence with which rihe had adopted the new cap and dress which Totuni had brought her from the city. Her ducks were no longer "biled," but "boiled," the diphthong slipping out from ortho- dox tunnelled lips; yet adopted with as much grandmotherly simplicity as the new cap was, and equally pleasing in its effect upon all her guests. There are simple-hearted people who Irise and fall with the social atmosphere about them like delicate thermometers, yet wittlout the least affectartion. "Our, girls will be swimming like dolphins  in another month, Captain Giles," said Mrs. Warnen r. "Yes, madam; Totum should have been a boy and a sailor. Your little Anne is too good to be a midshipman;; yet I am almost in favor of getting her the' appointment, if you don't object." "Thank you," said the lady, smiling. "I  appreciate your kind intentions, and will think of it." "Mother world hardly wish them transferred to me,tlioughl!"cried Frank. I'I was crazyto bo a middy once, and she buttoned me into a huge staffed rocking-chair, and set me to work-- ing perforated card-board. She intended me to produce a wreath, wine green leaves and red roses; but the leaves turned out to be blue, and the roses black.. So we gave treat up, and took to millinery in the paper-doll line. I have no doubt I cotild astonish Midcet to-day in scis. Sors-craft, of the General Tom Thumb and Mrs. Tom Thumb variety." "Do give us a specimen, please," said Miss Mary, reaching over paper and scissors with a dainty hand. "Where is MictgetS  he asked, taking the materials, with a laugh and blush. Shell and Fannnie slipped out a moment since," said Totum. -'l I ieard Midgetwhhisper- ing, I I'm King Solomon and you are Q&amp;ueen Elizabebth, you know. It is time to meet the Empress Catherine.' And so they went." "When children play kings, they are kings, in feeling, down to the tips of their toes," said Mr. Warner.  I don't know how the rest of you feel, but it tempts me to envy."   Tile conversation and the doll's millinery were both interrupted at this point by a sum-' mons to dinner, where the heath-fowl appeared in all their glory.  1Massa'chusetts laws were very strict at one time against shooting grouse on this island," said the sonorous voice of Captain Hezekiah, as soon as the carving begn. "They were not known at that time to be found anywhere else than here in the whole country, and in the in- terest of science it was desirable to save the, spe. cies from becoming extinct. That seemed not easy to do, for heatli-fowl were esteemed the greate-st delicacy, and would bring almost any price in the Boston market."  "Indeed! are they so rare a bird as that?" said Mr. Warner. The intelligence bad whet- ted hris appetite wonderfully, giving it a keen edge for the breast and wing of a tender heath.  chick. He glanced with satisfactio n at -the Progress of the skillful carving, and at- tile abundance of the present supply. "It was suppos(!d so, sir, at that time. Since then -they -bave discovered the-saMe bird on the Western Prairies, and they send them to the Eastern markets now in such quantities that they really bring less per pound than a tur- key." "Ah I but they are a delicacy! I think I hanve certainly eaten them, and they welre excel- lent." So they are, sir--so, they are; but if dia-- monds were as common as quartz crystals, kings and queens wouldtl't much care any longer to possess them." "No, no! I see. They would cease to be lirized as crown jewels ; but they would always harve the same wonderful playg of light, how- ever, sir."Thle invalid rubbed his hands and moved a little excitedly in his cllair, for tile flash of the diamond had a beauty in i tself which lid loved, independent of all1 moneyed estimates. Moreover, he was anxious to prove to himself that heath-fowl were a delicaev, for this wonldd help to strengthen his capricious appetite. His wife, who bad it in her lreart at that moment to annililate all the beatht-fowl of the prairies, or at least to wipe out her husband's knowledge of them as a hindrance to the supremest relish of his dinner, w-as relieved to see that the diamond comparison had consoled hint. The next mo- ment he was ready for the practical test, and shortly after sent up his plate to be helped a second time; so in that quarter the dinner was eminently successful; and it proved favorable eveit to digestion, and to a subsequent estimate of Captain and Mrs. Giles, who never fell back   again in his appreciation to exactly the plebeian level to which he had previously assigned: them. But Midget and F'anny had forgotten even their dinners, and were nowhere to be-found. Carrline Darkiin was dispatched in search of them, taking the heath-fowl to Margaret on her way; but the children bad not been there. Molly bad seen them going towards the shore, carrying a large box, and there they were found. The box was immediately covered by Midget, who informed Clarline and Molly thart it contain- ed a royal menagerie, but it couldn't be seen till it was first exhibited at court. Afterwards they should both have a peep at all the -curious wild beasts. Carline carried the menagerie on her shoulder, the children whispering to 'each other that she was a monstrous great elephant carryin his load; but they were careful not to let thejgood-natured Indian girl hear them, and went home to dinner like good 'Children. Finding places waiting them, and plates al- ready filled, they both replied in monosyllables to till questions, leaving Cazrline to explain that she had found them at the sea-side; but when the first course had satisfied more imperative claims, Midget announced that a, wonderful me. nagerie was to be exhibited after dinner. It was a Noah's Ark, and all the animals were in pairs; but it was an ark for sea-animals to live in on land-not an ark to k-cep land people from drowning. Could fishes live forty days and forty nights in your ndw ark, Midget 3"asked Frank. "Oh yes, I am sure they could. They are all as happy as the sIpiders on our wall up stairs, whenever I can co'axTotum to let 'em stay there." "Somebody has given us a splendid wide.- necked bottle, and we have made a pretty little aqunarium, I imagine," said Mr. Walrner, look- ing pleasantly across at the children, whose eyes were shining: with irrepressible delight. "Oh no, sir; it isn't that. I've seen those, and they are beautiful; and I have seen gqld- fishes in such lovely glass balls; but this is a great deal funnierr" "What can it be?3" wondered every body; for they had all giood-naturedly concluded to re-ard this as L'the children's hour."Midget and Fannie could hardly cat the nice custard- piec, and the pudding with raisins, so jubilant were they; and the elders seemed to them ex-  cessively wanting in enthusiasm; yet, in the end, even they were abundantly satisfied with the sensation made by their sea-ark. It wasS a wooden grocer's-box, plentifillly Cprinkled on the bottom with damp sand, and   apparently it contained about two dozen shell. fish on legs, scrambling about in all directions in a most lively and entertaining manner. WaWlking fishes, as I'm alive 1" cried Frank, in unfeigned astonishment. "Wel12 that is- funny," and he actually went down on his knees, bending over them with the most an- imated curiosity. II They are real shell-fishes, and walking about on real feet." "That's because Fannie find Migdet are two real fairies," said Captain Giles, giving both children a good hug in his ample alrms. "It doed look like somethim, VI neanny,"' said Mr. Warner. III really don't understand it." He, too, peered over curiously at the odd vari- eties of unknown creatures. "Was it you who got it up, Captain Giles?" asked Mrs. Warner.. "Not I," laughed the captain, giving the children another bug. "It's all these fairies." "It is very wonderful, however it was done," mused the lady. "There are eight or ten dif. ferent kinds of shells at least, and they are nearly1 all behaving in exactly the same way." IIYes, and here are two land-snail 'S mother, with legs like all the rest. These don't belong to the sea at all. You see, they are all1 madle- tip things. Now, what hocus-pocus did do it VI asked Frank, only to be greeted with a tumult- uous laugh on the part of all the initiated. 11  think I've seen some of these things before tumbling about in thia little pools; but I can't be sure," lie added, a little crestfallen. 1 No, don't be too sure of any thing, my boy,") said Captain Giles, oracularly. II The've managedd it splendidly, at any rate," remarked Captain Hezeckiali. 'I've lived on the shore all my life; but I really shouldn't have Supposed it could be done so harndsomely-with  such variety of shells and Colors..' All this time the little ones were dancing about, both of them-the impersonation of glee and satisfaction; and the shell-fistl scrambled and tumbled about in the sand, and up the sides of the box, in sympathy. There were two delicate, salmon&amp;olored young pyrulas, nearly a dozen white, gray, drab, and moss- grown whelks, colored in pairs, and matched in Size, a number of the largerl sea-snails, the pair of lalnd-snails, and various bri-bt-colored little periwinkles. "Anne knows about it, " said Frank. "I guess you would know a little something about it, too," retorted the child, mischievous- IY7 " if you hadn't thought it too girlish to go pooling with us. I know what they are, but I    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5826-00000054"/> didn't know any thing about this Noah's Ark; and I don't see how they found so many kinds, and so well matched, in the little while they were away looking for them." "Oh, we didn't do that," explained Midget. "We made a pond for them by walling up one of the little pools with more pebbles. Fannie and I have been getting them together for a long time, and we staked the pond in with bar- rel-staves, so that they kept in through all the high tides. When grandpapa said we were going to have a party, and 1 must help enter- tain the visit, then we planned the Noah's Ark." "Well, you have entertained us very effect- ually, little one," said Mr. Warner, patting her, approvingly, on the head. "We shan't forget grandpapa's grouse and your Noah's Ark in many a day." "But what are they, at any rate?" persisted Frank, appealing to Anne, as the most likely person to heed his question. "Only little hermit-crabs," said the child, simply. "They haven't any shells of their own, and so they take an empty one that hap- pens to suit them, and live in it, Captain Giles told us; and I've watched them. We pulled one out of his house one day; but it seemed almost like pulling him to pieces, for he clung so. See!" she exclaimed suddenly, pointing towards a little crab, which, on the instant, seemed to be coming out of his own shell, and sliding into another. "Do see!" A dozen pairs of eyes, half of them in spec- tacles, followed the direction of her finger with eager interest. Fannie's love of color and re- pose had made her select several shells without tenants. There were whelks, and aq' single helix" prettily shaded with dark bands, put in to match the handsome house of one lively crab who was among the prettiest of the small ad- venturers. The restless little hermit had halted at one of these deserted castles, and, dissatisfied with his own house, evidently proposed to himself to  investigate the other. Ie still kept his hind i   feet upon his own shell, but he went into the other, remaining there several minutes. Then he came out, and, going into his own shell again, started once more upon his travels, car- rying his old house with him as he journeyed. He soon came up to a second empty whelk, and went into that in the same way as before, still keeping a firm hold upon his own house with his feet; but he remained here even less time than before, for it was a smaller shell, and evidently not ample enough for his needs. Away he went the second time, straggling about among his fellows, and almost losing himself in the general scramble of excited little soldiers; but, as he was the observed of all observers, he was easily noted as stopping again by the emp- ty helix and sallying out once more to recon- noitre this other possible domicile. The little fellow went in and out once and again, but at last he drew away his feet from his own home- stead, attaching himself exclusively to the spa- cious new house, and in a minute more he was trotting about with it, evidently immensely sat- isfied with his bettered fortune. The enthusiastic cheers with which he was greeted seemed to disturb the whole menagerie, which was apparently getting more and more excited with the unusual state of things. Mid- get, seeing this, and thinking that every body had looked long enough, suddenly dropped the lid of her box, announcing that all the animals were going now to their water pasture. She and Fannie marched off to the sea-shore, carry- ing the box between them; taking Margaret and Molly on their way. The poor little hermits were as glad to get back again into their pool as so many tigers would be to get out of their cages into the old familiar jungle again. Midget had provided herself with fragments of the grouse and other edibles, which she scattered liberally among them. The crabs enjoyed the feast rather more voraciously than their predecessors had done an hour earlier, and every body slept that night happily content with the day's entertain- ment.   CHAPTER XXV. OVER THE DOWNS.   IT was a cheerful party that set out one morn- ing, in strong shoes, carrying a bristling array of pretty little baskets, lunch-laden on the out- ward-bound cruise, but destined to be filled with miscellaneous land and sea treasures on the re- turn trip. There were Captain Giles and his granddaughters, Frank and his sisters, Mary Percy and Margaret. The patriarch of the par- ty, judging from the perpetual sunshine that came pouring from his eyes, which were like two illuminated windows in the front of a bat- tered old fort, lighting up every thing around it, was in a delightful state of internal glow and scintillation. Midget and Fanny were on ei- ther side of him-one little round, soft hand of each covered up in his, which were wrapped about their "mites of puds" like great wrin- kled brown leather gloves; but evidently very nice and comforting on the inside to each little wearer, who laughed and chatted to the equal content of their own hearts and his. "I should like to go off on a whaling voyage with you, grandpa,"'said Midget, after the first effervescence of the morning had subsided. "We would have just such a nice company as we've got here now, with grandmamma along too, to cook, and four or five other people that we like, to do things and enjoy it-not any com- mon sailors or strangers, you know, but all of 'cm our real friends, like Alfred Brand, and Captain Percy, and Edgar." "That would be the most delightful whaling crew I ever heard of!" said the grandfather, warmly. "Wouldn't it, grandpa? and shouldn't you enjoy it all so much?" "I am entirely sure I should, Midget." "Don't you think we really could do it, then?" "I'll think about it. We must ask grand- mamma." "You see it would be so nice, Fannie,'be- cause it would be so- long that we should have time to enjoy it, and nobody to come at all and   I disturb us! I always do so dr people who  will come and interrupt!" "But perhaps we migllt get home-sick before' it was over, or else dreadfully sea-sick in the storms." "Oh, that wouldn't matter! Couldn't girls get over that, just as boys do?" "Certain, Midget," said grandpapa, giving her little puff of a hand an approving squeeze, while all the wrinkles in his old face were cov- ered over with young sunshine. "I am afraid I shouldn't like it!" said Fan- nie, apprehensively. "Shouldn't you?" Midget slipped out of her grandfather's hand, and, stepping in front of them, stared incredulously into Fannie's face, so that they were all brought to a sud- den standstill. "Do yon really mean so, Fan- nie?" "I don't quite know," she answered, blush- ing, and wavering in her opinion. "Well, I do!" said Midget, sturdily; and with a touch of scorn, "I wish grandpapa would do it, and I would!" "We'll think about it, puss; but don't you see we're falling behind? You must sail on and talk at the same time. I haven't a grain of doubt but you could learn to run up the rigging and harpoon whales." "Oh yes, I should like to climb ropes; and we would fix a real sky-parlor up there some- where, as uncle Nat has in his great walnut- tree, to look out from and watch."The child was still standing facing them; but when her grandfather wheeled her about, she went on, mechanically, keeping pace with the others. "I don't know about spearing the whales, for I don't want to kill any thing, and Fanny don't. The grown-up people could do that, you know; and the children could play a good deal; and all the grown-up ones, too, when there were no whales in sight; and we could tell stories in the evenings." "You think we could make some of the best    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5826-00000055"/> and funniest sailors' yarns that ever were spun in all the world, i suppose?" "Iam sure we could, grandpa; and the ship would be ever so much better than a desert island, because we could keep going to different places and see things." "'I would rather all go to Europe, though, and see London and Paris," suggested Fannie. "Why, that would just spoil every thing," said Midget, in a vexed, positive tone. "I want it to be all to ourselves, and that wouldn't be. Mine is just as different as walking in Boston, wherhere are ladies and beggars and all such thin, and walking here alone, with nothing in the world to see us except grass and sheep and hop-toads. Don't you think it is, grandpa?" "Perhaps; but I guess most people would like Fannie's plan the best. Besides, there is something here worse than sheep and hop-toads. Don't you see, children, there's a robber!" nod- ding up into the sky at a majestic fish-hawk which went sailing over them with a large fish in his talons. "Oh!" cried Fannie; "poor fish, it's too bad! But isn't he beautiful, though?" The attention of the whole party being called to it, they all stopped and stood looking to- gether. "The gray old pirate! he is outsailing the wind as though he thought a just judgment was after him," said Margaret. "What a handsome, strong fellow he is, though! It would prick my conscience to shoot him, if I had a gun here." "If you could hit hin, Frank," suggested Totum. Frank laughed and bowed his adop- tion of her remark, with a little curl of the up- per lip. "He looks as pretty and soft as a dove now, sailing so far off there in the sky, doesn't he, Miss Mary?" said Anne. "Yes." "Yes, Anne, and Captain Kidd will be a hero by the time you are grown up," added her brother. "Looked at through your spectacles, then, Frank," put in that irritating Totum once more. "What a time over it! A hawk is nothing but a fisherman," said Midget, vexed at being interrupted in her castle-building. "I am glad he is dropping into his nest now, where he can give his children something to eat;" and every body-even grandpapa-seemed to be suddenly put under an extinguisher. "Midget must have been at least as high up   as the moon, and didn't like to come down," quietly remarked Totum, taking Mary Percy's arm, and walking on, followed by the others. "Grandpa, wouldn't you like to be captain, and take us all down there across the equator P" "I'll think about it in sober earnest,- and let you know, little mate. If I do go, I shall choose you for second mate, Midget. Grand- ma must be first mate, you know." "Now you are making fun, and I shan't tell any more! Let's run on, Fannie, and then you and I can talk all to ourselves. Good-bye, grandpa!" suddenly turning back to him good. naturedly. "I don't like so many to hear, you see," she explained, when they had got a little way in advance; and the complaisant little Fannie, who was always fascinated by all the imaginings of her little friend, was as ready as herself to plunge back again into the dreani of a delightful floating colony of dear friends. The others soon halted again, for they were up now upon the high downs, and half intox- icated with the delicious air, the charming land. scape, which was principally " water-scape," to say nothing of the sky over head, which was al- most cloudless, with no living thing to be seen upon it since the fish-hawk had disappeared; but with an opaque whiteness about it, just a little burnished by sunshine, which was refresh- ing for the eye to rest upon. Midsummer days tempered with sea-breezes are a luxury un- known inland-a kind of mixed condiment the flavor of which can only be appreciated by act- ual experience. "This island is a jewel in the rough," said Margaret; " and for one I hope they never will spoil it by any grinding-down, polishing proc- ess." "I'm with you there, Margaret," said Frank, heartily. "I never want to come here again, if this end of the island becomes a fashionable watering-place. It would be like changing a nice little live country girl into a fashion-plate." "We are any thing but that at present, I think,"said Captain Giles. "Girls, will you all shoot at a target, if I get up a set of bows and arrows?" "Of course we will; or we'll try our hands at hawks and heath-hens, if you like that better, grandpapa." "I had better get shot-guns, then." "Just as you please; we are ready for any thing that isn't wicked, as Midget always says." "I should propose horseback-riding, and challenge you all to a race; only there are not six horses on the island that could be got to go faster than a jog-trot."   "Oh no, Frank, let us all have a whole set of bows and arrows, and we'll practise every day. There is time enough for that yet before we go home."The quiet little sister's eyes sparkled coaxingly at the thought. "Archery is better, than grammar, isn't it, Annie?" said Totum, whose heart always warmed towards the child whenever she came out from the thin crust of her little womanly staidness. "You and I may find ourselves walking on stilts yet before our country merry- making is all over. I should not at all mind having a private balloon to float about in over the heads of the natives, if Captain Giles wouldn't care." "Up like a rocket, and down like a stick," quoted Captain Giles, giving the laughing girl a redder cheek than ever, after a loving nip with his thumb and finger. "Take a good right- handed hold upon the frolics of the earth, and you may venture to leave the flying to butter- flies and grasshoppers. I always regard it as nothing but a daring vanity to try to fly up to heaven at the tail-end of a bag of gas." "Captain Giles among the conservatives! What will come next, Totum?" asked Frank. "Fishing." Do you and Mary intend to fish?" "Mary declines. I shall try it; but think I shall resign very soon to Margaret, because I have other fish to fry." - They had all seated themselves here and there on little knolls, to rest and enjoy the scene; but Margaret had drawn a little apart, absorbed in her own thoughts. She was older than the other girls; but it was not this which had spread the great gulf between them, spanned by a swaying bridge, which none of them often found it easy to pass over. It was pleasant for Margaret to enjoy the society of the kind old captain, and she had grown into a 'cordial friendship for the family with whom she re- sided; but these two girls were as far away from her as America is from Ireland. Always respectful and considerate, they hardly knew how to entertain her; and she rarely ever di- rectly addressed either of them. This was not Totum's fault, for Margaret had repelled her at first with an almost unconscious jealousy, which had crept into her own manner unawares, and the first early icicles of their acquaintance had received no sunshine yet to thaw them. Miss Mary found it hard to forget that Margaret was cook and waiting-maid. Certainly, she was not an ordinary servant; but then she was a servant. Of late Mrs. Warner had insisted on Marga- ret's joining most of the excursions, and she   was not averse to doing so; and yet much off the time she was just a little outside of the pith of all their merry-making. Totum attached Anne very much to herself, leaving Margaret more alone than she otherwise would have been; and now, as she sat there, she was ab- sorbed with her own thoughts. "It will be much better for me to leave them altogether, and begin life once more upon a new platform. Here, I can rise no higher than I am. I can be nothing but a servant to them or to any one else-not even to myself. That was well enough in the past, but it 'grows every day more and more distasteful to Ine, and it is my duty to find something else to do. It shall be type-setting or a telegraph office. I think it must be type-setting-that opens a broader field;. and if I can find a situation, I am bound to find one! It's a blessing that I have saved money enough to go upon for a good while. Ugh! I dread it, though-starting off alone! I'd as soon take a voyage among the Greenland ice-bergs-if it would answer as well, but it won't. Yes, I'll really do it at once, directly we are set- tled again in Boston." It would be difficult to say how much hero- ism entered into this resolution to leave the home where she had found kindness and shel- ter for so many years, and take up a new call- ing. Respectable American women were be- ginning to learn type-setting, and she knew herself to be the equal of these. To her, the new work would be a rise in the social scale, and would give her a more independent, self- sustaining position; yet they would all oppose it, and her own heart would be shrinking and traitorous to her best interests. If it were' not for her suspicions of their entire good faith to-' wards her-"the worm i' the bud" of all her  trust in them-the resolve must lave cost her still more. "It would be hard for them, at first, to spare her, yet it would be best even for them, and certainly desirable for herself," and then her thoughts turned again to Alfred Brand. "His love, and a home with him! once that had seemed possible; and what a brave, good, and noble woman she could have become if once planted in that sunny soil! But all that was past. Ah! how every thing pleasant was sip- ped up before her eyes; like the first sparkling dew-drops, by some envious fate. He would be sure not to come home again while she staid here, and she couldn't even wish that he should come." -Her look wandered across the water Ito a lonely fisherman's island-her thoughts wandering off to wastes still more desolate. ef    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5826-00000056"/> While there is a little tender hope left as leav- en to one's bread, one doesn't mind eating the very coarsest nieal; but take that away, and it is all as heavy as lead. A rise in life, and abroad-. er field to work in, are very: good things in them- selves; but they must get a deeper hold on the sympathies than the mere consent of the intel- lect, before they can lighten any- heart of its burdens. II A penny for your thoughts, Margaret;," call- ed Captain Giles, cheerfully; but with a touch of sympathy in his voice. He had been watch- ing her, and felt that it would be kind to call her back to the merry 'company, for he was balf prepared to see her burst into sobs or tears. "I was just saying to myself, captain, that it is necessary to take a goo4 deal of exercise in order to keep a good digestion, and if -no one has any objection, I propose to keep moving on." "That's sensible, and I second the motion."' Margaret glanced sharply across at Captain Giles, to see if he had read her thoughts; then laughed at herself for her suspicion, and her face brightened for them all as she went skip- ping on before in apparent, bounding happiness. Captain Giles wondered whether he was mis-- taken, and rather hoped he was.   On they went, on and on to the sea-shore, stopping to rest far out on the stony beach, ev- iery body perched on a great rock; for here boulders of all sizes had fallen out froth the land, quite filling the middle ground between the sea and the cliffs. Farther alone, a party of fishermen had put up a small house upon the upland, and below they had thrown out wide, heavy planks, fastened to the rocks with great iron pins, and extending out above the water even at high tide. Each line of plunk had a fixed seat near the end, where a fisherman may sit comfortably, looking down into the sea be- low, and throw out his line, dragging in his splendid bass from, the little rocky shallows, at almost all hours of the day; but at high tide, or in a storm, the water sometimes foams over these wooden bridges, hissing amona the great boulders, and lashing the whole sea round about into frenzy. These flshermenn proprietors were away at present; aind having given -Captain Giles the -key to their house, and the free use of their bridges and fishing-rods, our parts, bad come over the downs today chiefly for the fish- ing; but there were only three bridges, and the  majority of the young people had an independ. ent programme of their own. A rocky sea. shore is never stale or unprofitable to any hu. man being who is alive himself.   CHAtPTER XXVI. FISHNG G   TOWN andr the two gentlemen at once took possession of the bridges, while the others stray. ed here and there, finding no lack of amuse- ment. Star-fishes, which had not been abun- dantt on the coast near home, were stranded here in numbers, many still living in the little ba- sins where they had been left by the retreating tide; and others, helpless 'upon the dry sands, excited the pity of the cilildren, who were straightway busy in lifting them tenderly back into the water, Midget looking very pitiful, and Facnnie failrly shedding tears over one poor little star, who had to be sent back into the sea with A sadly maimed limb. Young crabs were si- dling about, in some of the water-pits among the stones, pretty little bright-colored winkles were lifting out their heads, and soft fringy things were waving from the sides of every rock in great multitudes; so that the little prospectingi parties were in a continued state of varied but ecstatic delight. There also were innumelrable   small shining pebbles, garnered up and polish- ed by the beauty-lovilig ocean; sparkling bits of quartz, and even scales of mica, were cling- ing to -fragments of iron 'conglomerate; and pretty little iron cups could. be found for the searching, almost as easily as oak-saucers can be gathered under an oak-tree. After a while, Totum, who had no success in, fishing, Ireturned to theAhore, begging Malrgaret: totyher luck upon the bridge; and Margaret, willing for a time to hear nothing but the voice of the waves and her own thoughts, was soon seated, fishingf-rod in hand; yet but very Hittle 'Mindful of the possible bass. It was an ex- tremely novel sensation to look down into the rocky deeps of the ocean below her, where the olive sea-weeds were waving their dotted leaves to and fro, fast anchored upon the solid stones. Now, at last, she had found an opportunity to indulge in fast-coming, moody reveries, entirelyv lyhout stint.   The captain and Frank were on either side of her, hardly twenty rods away, but neither could well outroar the ocean to address her; and as she had tied her broad hat firmllv down at the sides of her face, she was practically alone itt the eye of the great wide seal before her. She was not tempted to look off into the watery distance, where there was nothing new; but down below her everywhere there was a won- dlerful fascination, furnishing endless analogies for her brooding discontent. "See how every little stem. of sea-kelp has gnanwed its way into the hardest -grani te, hiding its want of living rootlets closely in its stony cup. Every plant is eating up the rock it clings to; oh! so slowly it may be, but every grain of the rock is only an extended fibre of its own. Some time in the far-off ages all thcse stones will be changed into yellow-green kelp, writh- ing and tossing in the angry waters. They seem at rest now; but they will be as restless then as the panting sea. Every thing is tumult, unrecst-tunmult, even when it seems as still as. death. There is no quiet anywhere this side of the grave." Margaret shut her eyes to hide the desolate vision from herself; but the eternal roar went on in her cars, and she Ileard in it such an un- dertone of unutterable, irrevocable doom, that she was glad to open them again in haste, and look about her for diversion with a sharpened eyesigh t. "hat a rich bed of green and purple sea- weedl there- is over there; and here is gold, crimson, and almost every blended shade of wonderful beauty. Ttley are all nestling down now in the pleasant silvery water; but in an- other hour the rough tide will roll in and cover them all a fathom deep. Yes; children's hearts are all rainbows, while mine is as sombre as that tossing mass of old tangled weeds.  "Ah! there'saalittle floating ball of sometliingi which looks as mottled and soft as a child's worlsted  tisty-tosty.  What's he 'at, I wonder? animal or vegetable? And is it really afloat, or has it some mooring down below?3 It rolls in and out with eve ' wave; but is it really anchored or not?3 and 'is any thing fast anchor- ed in all the earth? 4 I Hw the water boils in here now, dashing tip towards me as though it were always hungry I It really does behave like a live creature, raven- ous and desperate!"She rose up nervously, looking about her for reassurance as to the safety of her position. Glittering wreaths of spray dashed over tile very end of her platform with every beat of-, le   incoming tide, which began to lash the founda. tion rocks, and send spirited jets of water Yery freely over her little, frail bridge. Was it safe? Frank was just disentangling a mass of long green tangled streamers from his line, his boy- ish face bright with happiness, and his rather curly liair floating in the wind like a perpetual, ripple of satisfaction. Margaret smiled ats she looked, seating herself again, reassured and comforted. Turning towards Captain Giles, his almost wortl-out old face betrayed so keen an interest in life and its occupations, that she at once covered herself with reproaches f'ir indulging in morbid fantasies. Then she c /menced to moralize more cheerfully over a great crab near tile shore, who was making haste backward to the fiull extent of his limited powers; but just then the captain's posi tion changed, his face grew flushed and eager, and lie half stood up,, carefillly drawing in his line and lettiti' it out again as lie gave play to a large bass which he, had just hooked. This sent the crab away be- fore the moral was quite firmly tacked to him;. and whcn the splendid fish was landed, Margia-- reot's ev'e and Captain Giles's exchanged it perfect fusilade of cheerful congratulations. She simil- ingily drew in her own line, and with it a long, green ribbon, attached to its whitish glutinous. rope of a stem, almost as tomgh as India rubber. The doublle-bladed, sword-like green leaf wats. exquisitely soft and snlooth ; and its beauty quickened a sense of the ingratitude of her. stlort-sighted repining. In many places, the thick, green, velvety surface was most beautiful- ly embroidered in white raised figures, plroducedi by minllte insects. "Parasites," mused Margaret, 11 and yet they leave. done their work very charmingly. What am I better than they? In the Warner family I am only an oak-gall among the naturlll leaves; and they will grow all` the better when I am plucked off firom the branch. Well, that phase of life shall colne to an end, at any rate!" Her foot tapped the answering plank beneath it. So far, at least, she was resolute and in ear. nest, sustained by an unexpected courage.. Then she thought again. "The Alfred Brand I cared for was only made of dreams and sunshine I I will cast ,that away from me as I send this shining thing back again into the sea, and all of life shall'be. gin again. Why not? It almost seems easy) just now.", It is hard to' be consistently "a blighted being" under twfenty-five; and if Margaret ar-' ranged her bait and threw off her line with real    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5826-00000057"/> enjoyment and a hope of success--which seem., ed almost to be typical of her possible future- thiis argued nothing against her woman's con. stancy. The sea-breeze was- deliciously stimu- lating. A magnificent swell and surge of break. ers was like nothing which can be experienced either from the shore or from mid-ocean-aa grrand, roll and turmoil of the elements beneath her, of which she seems almost to be part and parcel, but over which she has no posssble con-  trol ; and whose power over herself isjust enoughI within the bound of possibility to stimulate a daring play of emotions while the judgment re-, mains impassive. After a while, Margaeret stood up like one in- toxicatedE, equally forgetting all about both her-t self and her fishing in her absorbing watch of the increasingly grand procession of the waves. Captain, Giles and Frank, each on his little pcrch above the rising sea, were wholly intent Upon catching; fish--the more eager to make the most of it since time and tide were both leagued ;against them. All the others had strolled a good way off along the beach: yet one pair, of eyes, surmounted by a shock of tumbled red )fair, were anxiously watching Margiaret. Alfred Brand, returning home from his cruise, saw the party crossing the downs while he was ,on his way to his cotisin's. He had followed them at the earliest convenient moment, hoping to find the long-rdelayed opportunity of confess- ing his sins to Mqrgaret alone; and he sto d now for a moment upon the shore, vacillating and undecided whether or not to go to her at! J once as she stood upon the bridge; -but with a I growing presentiment, as he noted her absorbed  mood, that his prepenoe there was a special The girl stod carelessl holding her rod, at ' the very end of the platflen, looking down into  the boiling, depths below.  1  must go to her!" said Alfred, starting for-I wRard with a hasty step. '( It is not safe!"I Buat the first bass that had fhnecied the little $ish which was upon her hook to,day, sud-E ,denly seized it now, and, finding-himself caught,  -flounced violently out into deeper water, jerk- c  ,2ng the unconscious Margaret headlong into the gulf below.  Thle next moment-liatless,' coat- 8 Jqss, and barefooted--Alfred sprang upon the' i quivering planks, and, throwing himself' upon t his face., reacted over with an extended arm, P -waitinlg -brieathesshy for heri reappearance.  Frank had tn'rne just -in time to see her hid- den beneath the water; Nit the captain fished 3 on, entirely unconscious of the enacting tragedy, / i till aroused by their startling enics,    S]   1. I:1Break off your hooks and hold fast to the -end of your lines!" said Alfred, as they- both a. hurried to his assistance. SLhe can not be 1-reached from here."  c. He seized the two flsbingl-rods, winding the id'strong cord around one arm, and, swinging a; himself down from the planks, hung suspended h there a moment, till Margaret was a second dltime driven in among the. cruel rocks; then, t- throwing himself into the water at the same in- hstsant, he seized her by the dress and wedged ahis long rods between the sustaining rocks. -But it seemed in vain to struggle with the /lngry ocean, which dashed them both merei. t. lsslv'to and fro. The others did their best to draw in the lines, till- one of them snapped asun. F'der, and the result seemed almost hopeless. 'Don't draw, but hold on firmly, Frank,it cried Captazin Giles. t Rushing to the nearest plank, with a super- : human force he tore out the iron fastening front Ithtie rock, and, lifting the end by. main strength, "he pried oout the other fastenings with a great wrench, and in another instant one end of the Iheavy' plank wavs in the hands of Alfredl. It was fillally drawn in to the shore, and the two young people both lay dripping and insensible among the pitying dry pebbles. IThe sands were not only drinking up the, sea. water, but the blood which was flowing freely from a wound in Alfred's head; and Margaret Iwas apparently lifeless. Trotum and Maryv had joined them, and Margaret was carried at once into the little flsherm an's hotel, while Alfred was cared for and his wounds bound up ten- de rly. In titne Margaret breathed again, and. would recovel, though much bruised aind battered anmong the remorseless rocks, in addition to the drowning from which she had so narrowly es- caped. Alfred soon regained consciousness, though be at flrst sat up, staring about him with a bewildered look. II It is all right! Margaret is alive, and will Soo be well again. You have saved her!" an rankk grasped  his hand with a grateful fclasp., The dull eve lighted at once, and Alfred was soon able to rise, proposing to set off with Frank 'in search of a conveyance home for the rest of the party. Nothing would deter him from this plan, and, without seeing Margaret, they started as soon as he was sufficiently recovered. - II Who fished me out of the waterr?' asked Margaret of the girls, who were bending anx- iously over her, when she found herself able to speak.  k   "Somebody who cares for you!" ' whispered Annie, putting her lips close down to Iargaret's ear. "'Alfred Brand jumped in himsef to save you; but grandfather and Frank both helped hirn," answered Toturn, rubbing awayijvigrorous- ly at her patient's feet wittl a strip oi MRidget's little plaid shawlv, which they had torn up for the occasion. We all came running as first as we could, bult they hadl just drawn you both out of the water togecther."   Margaret closed her eyeos again.  "Somebody who cares for you!" "Alfred Brand jumped in himself to save youl" rang like a chime of Christmas bells through her confused brain, and she heard and cared for nothing more. All that ni,(,ht and the next, whether she waked or, slept, there returned to her this never- weatryinrg duet, "Somebody who cares for me! Alfred Brand jumped in himself to save mel Somebody who surely cares for me!"   CH'APTE]R XXTVIL THFE EXPERIENCE'S OF A CONVALESCENT.   OncF, at home, and the first excitement-over, Allfred found that the wound on his head, and the general battering which he had received among the sharp-edged stones, had been much more serious thatn he supposed. A night of tossing and dreams, which continued sleeping or waking; and he found himself an invalid, entirely confined to the house for several days afterward. Mafrgaret was in all his thougtlts. He bad saved her life; he should yet win her aeknowl. edged love. But meantime, to think of noth- ingf else day after day, for the whole. twenty-four blours, was rather exhausting; and his good sense made him feel thenecessity of fixing his attention upon something less absorbing in its interest. His resources were rather limited. He had done up all conversational topics with his cous. in's family the first evening, and if a neighbor called, every, feasible theme seemed to be ex- hausted after a session of about ten -minutes. He had actually broken the back of his dear old slate, which had journeyed with him half round the world, by tossing it hastily down from sheer vexation; and books affected him as opiates do, a patient, who is irritated rather than stupefied by their influence. In this dilemma, be went back afresh to his old interest in the manifold treasures so carefully locked away in his sailor's  elliest. ,He studcied foreign seeds, ctlrious slips of wood and bark from outlandish countries, and dived -into the comparison of likenesses and differences among his never-ftiling shells, ex- amining every thing with a minuteness of at- tention to the objects before him which would have been quite creditable to any pupil of Agas-  Siiz, or even to that eminent naturalist himself.   But in his present state he was soon weary even of this. One pretty little shell, something more than an inch in length, which seemed to be a species of snail, was firmly cemented to a small stone, and he began to examine with some interest the nature and strength of this cement, finally dipping the whole into water, and smiling as the colors deepened, coming out withtl  added beauty under the illfluence of the fresh bath. The upper whorls of this shell were rose-colored, and the others, which increased rapidly in size, brown, mottled in stripes with a jellow-white. Alfred remembered distinctly'just where be had picked this up on the African coast, during his last voyage, nearly two years before. Hl was walking on the beach, and carelessly kicked  ttside the little stone which lay in the ffidst of two or three others, \phen this shell came to light; but whether it properly belonged to the land or the sea, he was quite unable to deter- mine. He hesitated whether or not to break it from the stone, but at a little wrench whichl he gave it was suddenly detached. A parchment-like substance still sealed up the whole mouth of the shell like an operculum. He was examin- ing it with a languid interest, wishing that there was no such thing in the world as aches and weariness, when his cousin's wife, knocking at the door, came bustling in without waiting to be bidden, bringing him, hot wilted cathbagh leaves, which she kindly offered to bind about his aching head. She was occupied with her baking, and Alfred assured her that he was quite able to do this for himselE. When she had gone, the warm day, and the'strong odor of the hot leaves combined, proved too much for him, and, actuated by some sense of quiet hu,    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5826-00000058"/> mor, he carefully bound up the -little Bulimus in the damp cabbage-leaves instead of his own head, and laid it down upon the top of his sea. chest. He had been sitting there in an ancient splint. bottomed rocking -chair, long since bereft of paint and varnish - the usual garments with "rhich rocking -chairs are wont to be clothed and protected--and in consequence of this ex- posure, perhaps, the chair had become a good deal palsied and rheumatic. It trembled and, inoaned faintly at every movement, as he rocked to and fro, yet the velry monotony of its cease- less plaint had something of the effect of a lullaby. Looking dreamily from the window, hardly thinking or feeling any thing distinctly, but vaguely longing both for Margaret and for! cooler weather, he fell illto a drowse. Meantime the cabbage-leaf ball, which had been simply crushed together, began gradually to unroll itself, the broad leaves acting as though they were voluntarily stretching inld splreadinji themselves into a more normril position; and, strangi3 to relate, the shell began to move also. It tilted a little, the parchment-like cement cracked asunder along its face, and two long fleshy horns, with eyes in them, began slowly to protrude from under the shell; and gradually a great slug-like creature spread himself out from beneath, till the shell seemed to be mounted upon him like an immense spiral cupola upotl a flat, irregular foundation. The new-comer apparently looked about him, wagging his four-horned heatd; lie moved a lit- tle, as -if re-testing his long-disused powers;i and finally ended by eating voraciously from the least wilted portion of the succulent cabbage-  leaf. At this stage of the proceedings, Alfred opened his eyes and stared at the creature in unfefirned astonishment; evidently believing, at first, that he was only a rather queer supplement to oneI of the dreams which had been haunting himI persistently as he slept. But he was awrake; he rubbed his eyes, and t then got up and went closer to the little mol- i lusk, peering at him in doubt and perplexity; i and ended by poking him about in the firm be- lief that somehow he hadl come out of the cab- I bag- e-leaf and taken possession of his convenient c shell. But the animal slipped into his house  again in resentment, and when Alfred took it t up in his hand, he found that the cement bad ' been broken away from the face, and that there b was9 really a living creature, evidently entirely I1 at home, inside. Alfred looke d at him with h growing wonder, compelled him to come a lit. ii   as fle way out of his shell, and examined blim Nviti, rn engrossing attention ; finally coming to the con. a- c lusion that the animal must have been sleeping: quietly in his snug house for almost two years, it- and had now suddenly waked up frorn Ifi state )f of peaceful hibernation. th Having settled this point, he treated his guest ,d to a fresh cabbage -leaf just from the garden, c- wtlich was evidently appreciated. The creature d ate away at it with obvious thankfulness, and id no wonder, after its long fast. Young man 7s speedy, recovery than hsnvlicdn ddmr oad hany thin., a else. It -gave him something to do, and that r Inightt lie slept almost as peacefnlly as little Buh-- r, mus had been doing for two years before. Next or! day he was bright and hopeful. In-the morning Mr. Warner called to offer i the aggregatee family gratitude for the values\ y life whi h Alfred had so heroically and oppor-- h tunely shed for them, and to congratulate himl rr upon his own escape from the perils of the sea. Frank had already called on him twice; but this was the first time Mr. Warner had seen t or spoken with him since they had parted upon the door-step on that memorable eveningr when MaMrgaret herself had been the chief subject of i their conversation. Iit was rather an awkward interview, and be-- Igan stiffly enough, though Mr. Warner's thanks were dignified and profuse, and his congratula- tions most thoroughly sincelre. He closed up the ordeal to which he bad doomed himself by a roundabout, uneasy explanation to the young Deliverer; informing him that 'though he had done them all a favor which was fullly appreci. ated, and would never be forgotten; and though Margaret herself was especially thankfull for it, yet, of course, it could in no sense chan,(,e the previously existing relations of the parties. "Of course not--not in the least!"AlfredI had replied, with a little scorn in his voice, and the suspicion of a mocking smile in his eye. "Any casual event, whatever its issue, cer- tatinly could not be expected to change the whole previously established current of all the affairs of life," purstied the gentleman. "Ceortainly not."It was fully understood by Alfred that all the relations of'the parties of course remained entirely unchanged. That his present view of these relations was taken from a standpoint entirely different from his visitor's, Alfred didn't see fit to explain; but he looked extremely serene aind contented. The new life which had unexpectedly, revived his rose-tipped, sepulchred Bulimus,wass infect- ing him with a fresh hope, which could afford   to be as courteous and crushing in politeness as tile thank-offering which was tendered himself, Mr. Warner stood up, clothed from head to foot in deportment; yet lie held his hai un- easily. His gratitude and good-will to -the young man were both unfeigned. He would gladly have given him money if he had beenl a step or two lower down on the social ladder; and he had been fbi two days trying to devise some means of doing him a favor 'Without giving of- fense. Moreover, Mr. Warnel sincerely be- lieved that he was seekin g  Margaret's best good by sending off unworthy. lovers, even with l out her knowledge or consent, and thus his very despotic benevolence was partially justified at least to himselE. He was a genuine autocrat, and Mrargare one of the beloved subjects whose interests were confided to his angust keeping. Yet it was useless to assure even himself that Iris course was either wholly disinterested or quite justifiable. "Conscience makes cowards of us all."It erects its own guide-boards, which - glimmer frightfully in -the moonlight of its distorted fancy. "I hope," said Mr. Warner, IIthat you are rapidly recovering from the injuries, which you received." "Oh yes, sir! They were only trifling. They merely gave me occasion for a little need. ed rest, and time to consider and rearrange my plans for the future." I Ah! yes ; yes, I dare say1."He spoke nerv- ously and doubtfully. Alfred's plans for the future loomed up be. fore Mr. Warner with a th reatening significance, w1)icli was only increased by the cool and placid naturre of the young man's unwonted bearing. Was this, perllaps, a taunt? some species of scab- barded, double-edged threat-offered in mock civilityP Alfred was smiling, certainly; but Avasn't there something Cynical or malicious in it, hinting at the memory of past provocation? He -girded himself aenew by taking the benefit of the doubt, and began aghin. "I hope you understand that we fill sincerely  feel that you have laid us under heav - obliga- tions which we can never repay;" but we shall be glad to reciprocate your kindness at any pos- sible opportunity." "Obligations are necessarily mutual, Mr. Warner," said Alfred, with increasing courtesy. "One must be rather happier, I think, in know- ing that he has done a good thing tlimself, than -in the simple knowledge that some one else has done it. I regard myself as entirely the favor- ed party in this matter,"   "Possibly, possibly!" responded the gentle- man, preparing to bow himself put without more delay. 'LThat is looking at it in a very favorable light, certainly; but I think you are right." He wass feeling more and more nonplused; and in haste to slip out of his dilemma by tulrn- ing Iiis back uponlit. "I have something to show'you, sir, which is very curious indeed," interposed Alfred, sud- denly Ilrresting him by a change of topic. He produced his little Aftican prodigy, find began to recount its history with detailed, excruciating niinuteness. The tone of quiet triumph and assurance pervading his voice and manner became -over, wheliningly puzzling to his listener. Thart this little creatulro, after'being for two years smoth- ereA in a closely-locked sea-chest, was now sud- denly alive and prospc;ring, seemed perfectly in. credible to Mr. Warner. The young sailor, whose eyes were flashing now with fire -and en- ergry enoughh to hide the deformities of red hair, freckled skin, and brusque manners, wats un- doubtedly-taking this very unusual mode of re- venging an injury. It was a cruel practical jofe--a species of illustrated sailor's yarn-andc hie was the victim. It was all the more excess- ively embarrassing, because there wasjust enotigh doubt and unce rtainty hanging d'bout it to com- pel him to remain wholly at fault. At last the poor man got tlimself out of doors, and took his leave, dripping with Inoisture from licad to foot, like the out-side of a pitcher that has been- suddenly filled up with ice-water on a hot day. "If I only knew certainly that ii was an in- stilt, I would go back again and cane the fellow soundly," lie muttered as lie walked away, soak. ing his fine linen handkerchief through and through by a perpetual wiping of his porous face, and then hanging it out to dry in the sun- shine, one corner held gingerly between his thumb and finger, as if after all he was com- pelled to offer it to his tormentor as a flag of truce. Alfred Brand sat watching him from his win-- dow, and laughing till his own handkerchief was wet, with the tears which bubbled overfrom his eyes in sympathy with his heart. He under- stood the case exactly, and had done so from the beginning of the interview; bslt there was so uncommonly rare a flavor in this amiable species of vindictiveness, that he couldn't resist the temptation of enjoying it to the utmost. Now they were even; and Alfred, who had found it hard, an hour ago, to take the blandly-    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5826-00000059"/> offered hand of his guest, could have shaken it heartily at this moment with the utmost good- ivill. It had all come about so unexpectedly, and was a revenge worthy of the gods. He was entirely, satisfied. He was strongly inclined to get on his hat and boots, and go at once to Margaret, but she was still an invalid confined to -her room. He would compel himself to wait, which he could easily afford to do, as his heart was hopeful. He was a well man again from that hour. Sundry wounds and bruises yet remained to be healed, but they were quite outside of himself, his restored self-respect and general mental health fullness. He did think of Margaret, and wonder wheth-   er a speedy explanation would be a -reat com-. fort to her or otherwise; but he settled it in his own mind that of course now she would conie to understand the real nature of his sentiments towards her, and could wait hopefully for a con- venient opportunity of meeting. He had no wish, either, to beard the lion in his dlen, or to administer any further retribution to an alreadlv worsted- antagonist. Tile Wafrners must losl' Margjaret, and their loss would be his gain. Here the balances were so clearly in his ownn favor, that he was willing to take the whole family into his affectionate sympathy. A good often thrives best, and blossoms nrost beautifully, when it is found growing in tho midst of the ashes of a burned-up evil.   CHAPTER XYXVIII.- SOME OF MARGARET IS TRIALS.   As Margaret recovered, the burden of her reveries gradually changed. "Some one who cares for me!" became to her rather a profound dlesire than a conviction. Alfred Brandt had saved her life, it was true; but lie would prob- ably have done as much for any man, woman, or child upon the island under similar cir- curnstances. She had seen him last scowling viciously, and turning froni her in hot haste; and she tried most conscientiously to push him, find all his doings, good or bad, entirely out of, lier thoughts. But this was more easily proposed than real- ized. Hl haunted her. When she woke up- suddenly his face was looking down at her from a little brown stain on the ceiling. She saw him hanging up among the shawls and dresses upon the rusty nails ait the sitfo of the room; and one day when a little mouse came peeping out from a hole in the floor, and stood looking at her with his bright, wicked eyes, his face slowly changed into Alfred's face, and his soft dove-colored hair flamed into a defiant red, and was sadly in need both of cutting: and combing. This state ofthings was alarming. She kept somebody almost constantly at her bedside chat- ting: to lier, to charm away the apparition; and she had just command of mind enough not to speak about "it to any one, whether -asleep or awake.' At the earliest possible moment she sat up and was dressed ; for she felt that this gave herI a more complete comtnand of herself, and she   took to cutting out and sewing with a zeal wor- thy of the contented seamstress, who hopes that Idress-making may be providentially assignedl to her as a permanent occupation, even in heaven. Margaret's will was a strong medicine whicl! effected a rapid cure. She was soon creeping about the tlouse, with a giait between a limp and Ek hobble, but apparently a little softer in tem- per, and altogether moresocially inclined thanll ever before. One morning, when most of the family were out on thec beach, she ventured down into the lower rooms in the comfortable shoeless- con- dition in which she had been sitting in her own chamber. I IWhy Marganret! bare feet?" exclaimed Mrs. Warner, alarmed at the thought of her taking cold. "How could you possibly do any thing so careless V" O Oh, of course, for the, good of my sole, Mrs. Warnrer," she answered, laughinglll; but red- deniag directly under tho eye of Totum, Giles, who stood at the outer door, bringing in a cov- ered dish. Margaret was annoyed at her coming at that moment ; but Totum hastily unveiled her treas- ures, displaying half a dozen nicely browned and rounded somethings, which had towered up, ambitiously from the basis of so many small tearcups into puffy little mountains'of blread. "ratdmarmma, has sent you over some of her nice coffee-cakes, Mrs. Warner. They are just fresh from the oven, and she hopes that   perhaps Margaret may find one of them rather improving to her appetite." CLThlank yotil, Miss Giles; but ought Marga- ret to eat warni cake?" asked Mrs. Warner, rather dubiously, and a little ungraciously. "Oh, they are neither sweet nor rich," an- swered Totum, with a complacent sense of do- ing a good deed, whether or not it; war likely to be appreciated. II We think them very whole- some.) IISpongie-cake without the sugar, Mrs. War- ner," said Margaret, breaking off a crumb and ea -ling it with relish and recovered good-humor. The lady also nibbled approvingly ; and as it wt ls about Margraret's lunch-time, shebegann di- rei-fly to more fully test the tnerits of Mrs. Giles's dainty offering; but her appetite was to capricious to be largely tempted. "'IDo you know, MaIrgaret," said Totum, cheer- fully, "Lyou remind me of the-little child otai nice Quaker lady I am acquaintedl with." "Please tell me about it, suggested Marga- rert, with, a willing interest. ('The little one had a sore finger, and didn't wish to go to school; and under this complica- tion of ailments, she lost her relish for break-- fast. I But, my, child,' said the mother, I thee Ilas made a little mistake; does thee know it?? A sore finger doesn't take away the appetite.' 'Doesn't it, mother?' said the little girl, look- ing as innocent as she could, with a very bright color spreading over her whole face. 'Tflcn, if thee pleases, mother, I'll take another pancake and some molasses.' N'ow, I think, Margalrct, thee has made a mistake also. A magnificent surf -bath shouldn't take away the appetite, surely! Hadn't thee better eat the test of grandmamma's' coffee-eatke 3 I think I will try to eat it," answered Mar- garet, laughing. The sunshine whichdimplecd both their faies lig)lted a window throiugl which each peeped a little farther than ever before into the other's heart, and the two girls began to understand and like each other. Indeed, Tottim, with her abounding good-nature, plrovedl to be a rather efficient Auxiliary in laying a great inany unwelcome thoughts. One day Margaret ventured to the sea-shore for the first time since the accident. She en- joyed the chance, and sat there taking long draughts of the soft fresh breezes, with a grate- ful sense of returning health and hatppiness.  The gentlemen of the fishing-club desired to secure the services of the Constance and her owners for a few days; and though Alfred was extremely relrrctant to leave home again with- out first seeing3 Margaret, yet business apparur   ently demanded this sacrifice of inclin ion,. and he consented. He was on his way oin. them, accompanied by a young man who bad only yesterday arrived from Neow York, when, they came very unexpectedly upon Margaret. She was still unconscious of their approachl and Ahlfred was trying to still the thumping of his heart enough to speak collectedlyg, beggingi the stranger to walk on alone for a few mo- ments while he waited to speak with -a friend, when the young man suddenly started forward, with an exclamation of pleasure and surprise. He seized Margaret eagerly by the hand, shak- ing it enthusiastically, and with all the deolight- ful familiaritv of an old friend. "Why, Margaralet, I am so glaid to see you, though it is entilrely unexpcted. When did you. come from Boston?"   I "More than two months aao. I am very glad to meet you again, Henry." Margaret's face also was glowing, and her eyes shining with a pleased antd satisfitctorS surprise. Bult why did-n't you answer my letter?" I never received an letter firom you." "Didln't? Why I gave it mvself to Mr. War- ner to hand to you, the day I left Boston." "Then I suppose it is quietly stowed away in some forgjotten dark corner of one of Mr. Warner's old last year's pockets," replied Mar- garet, trying.. to laugh; but staggering and steadying herself with resolute will to keep from dropping helplessly upon the sands. - She had caught sight of Alfred, standing there also, silent anld amazed. "Here is some one whom I have to thank for saving my, life not long ago," she stlid, tulrn. ing tfo Alfred and trying to look at birm; but cotlscious only of a1 confused, dark blulr, which. whirled and whirled before her dizzy ceves. "Don't thank -me for that, " said a deep, im- passive voice. "It -was no more tilan I should have done for any one else upon thee'island." "I Iznow it was not; but my life was of some value to me all the same." Poor Maranret strove to retain command of herself in Alfrecd's tictual presetlce, with a des- peration and heart-sinking which hald never been &amp;mamnded of her by the mocking face which had haunted her 'in her room for a week past. Alfred's woolds were only echoing her own thoughts, yet they chilled her to the heart. Her old ]over came to the rescue; for tilis was no other than the young carpentell whose nearly passion was all kindled anew -by this un- expected meeting. "Your life is of some value to me also, dear    <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5826-00000060"/> Margaret," he exclaimed impetuously, not only seizing her hand, but throwing his arm about lier as a support. He saw that she was still weak and suffering from too much excitement. "Ithank Mr. Brand also in your bebalE. Ihad lleard of the occurrence, but had no thought that it'was you, dearest, whose! life was saved. I can never tell either of you how thankful I am. Now, Margaret, will you answer the one ques- tion which was the burden of my letter?3 Will you be my wifee?" But Margaret was past answering-was even past fidlly comprehending the question ; but she, had some confused idea of its ilnport, and she knew that the two young men stood there both looking at her, and, both waiting for the words which it was impossible to utter. "Can-she care for him?"Alfred had hastily asked himselE ' Which was it that she thought Of and was renouncing in her strlfggle and ag- ony of that evening? At any rate, she shall hanve the privilege of a free choice;" and over-   whelmed as he w-as with emotion, he mastered it, and spoke to them both calmly. I Margasret knew that lie 'was saying something which she strove in vain to understand. She only gathered from it that he wished to see her and talk with her again before she left the isl- and ; but the young: carpenter knew that lie bad a rival, and one *bo would generously leave 'him to press his stlit without a witness, and abide, the decision. ' Then Alfred went forward, and Margaret found herself so entirely-helpless that she could only beg her old friend to help her to a seat upon the rock not far away- He talked on, warmly urging his suit; but her thoughts now had gone with the lover who had left her, and she was wholly deaf to the one who remained. But after a moment she com- pelled herself to listen, and to answer as kindly and as pityingly as she could; and then this one too .went away, and she was sit liberty to shed tears as bitter and briny as the waters of the ocean at her feet.   CHAPTER XXIX. DRAWrING THE SE-INE.   MARGtARET, left to herself, summoned back all her couragei. With a great sob of disappoint- ment and heart-break she tried to crush back all feeling, and, most of all, to thrust aside that perpetually teasing suggestion, "It might have been, 1 occupyingi her thoughts heroically with any thing and every thing else than the events which had so lately transpired. Her task was not an easier one than Alfred's had been when he sailed away fromt the island determined to ignore the existence of every things connected with it for the next six weeks at least; yet Margaret's success, for a time at any rate, was rather more decided than his. She dreamed again of childhood, and the dear ones who loved lier in the little thatched cabin at home ; and when the dream grew up, a ' she herself had done, t hreatening every moment to merge itself in the present, she shrank away instinctively from the, dmiglfer before she had reached it, switching her. self skillfully on to another track, and steaming off backward upon some diverging line. After she had made half a dozen trips to andI fro between a very early past and another still o a hmod way off--never once from anv outlook  catching a glimpse of the future, or even com-  ing near enough to take a single dreaded glanceI into the present--she began to find the processs, f   I too wearisome to be continlled indefinitely. Then, arming herself with a strong broad pecten, she went down on her ktlces before the tossing waves, mutely beseeching; them to help her to iforgetfulness by flowing in to the moats-with- which she hastily surrounded a mimic sand fort, imploring them to batter down the whole strong- hold, if possible, even at the imminent risk of a aood wetting to herselE. Hand and eye were both on the alert, for it was necessary to look steadily into the face of every incoming wave; and if there was' a vi- cious, sparkle in its eve, and its head was lifted ever so little higher than its fellows, she had to fall back at once before its superior might, and  inevitably suffer the loss of some of her out- works, or, possibly, to see the whole fort swept smoothly away at a stroke. Then the vigorous and absorbing skirmish all began with fresh zest, till, in the end, both were successful. Unconquerable Ocean always upheld his own rights, and maintained the ancient privilege of levelling his own beach with his own great roll- ers; and Margaret had balanced weariness of mind with a bodily fatigueo which was -a very good preparation for supper and'sleep, and the becst possible antidote both of retrospection aind anticipation. She ate her supper in peace, and   would readily have slept the sleep of a good conscience except that a new disturbing element unexpectedly supervened. A little knot of men were seen gathering upon the beach in the early dusk. They had a small row-boat, and an immense fish-net was seen drlaggling over the- side, half in the boat and half on shore. "The seine! The seine! They are going to drag the'seine to-nighlt!" shouted two treble voices in concert; and then Frank's rang out in a sounding tenor: "'Tell mother I'm off for the shore, girls!"He was off for the shore, as an arrow flies from the bent bow of a keen Ilunts. nian at sight of a bird on the wing. Then every body else was rnovcd to follow birn, though a little more decorously--every body except Margaret. She staidl behind, but her thougllts would not stay. They went off to the sholre with the rest, for there Wias Alfred Brand in the midst of this little group of fisher- men; most of them in bare feet, thcir trowsers rolled well up the leg, and all looking very much alike-in the distance, at least--to any casual observer. Alfred was perhaps a little conspicuous, from his unusually flaming: red shirt; but if he bad beecn clad in a suit of literal flames, be could Hardly have filled Margiaret's eye with molre glawre and warmth than lile now did. ` She ab- sorbedl so muuch of the influence that it seemed to be burning into her very soul, and yet she could not turn away. Her resolution had been only just strong enough to enable her to stop, thinking about this inexplicable Alfred ' Now that he was there before her, quite outside of her own volition, how could she help seeing him! Tllere was nothing in all her Ileart to restrain lier from looking; but, on the contrary, lier whole being had flown into her eyes. She was under the spell of a fascination ; but shle could no more have told whether the sensa- tion wars most of pleasure or pain, than the lit- tle bird could tell you what it feels when it is flattering under the magnetism of the relentless -serpent. The young man certainly felt any thing: but serpent-like towards Margaret as ' he stood on the shore wishing that she would come down there with the others; but of course she didn't know that. Mr. and Mrs. Warner were seated with the children upon the bank above, looking down upon the picturesque group on the beach, and Frank haed become one of the principal actors of the ev-ening--the most eager helper, probably, of the  ',whole party. There werle four or five men of  various ages-a gray-haired father, his stalwart   sonss and grandchildren, hi's neighbors, and a little independent party of "Lshavers," both boys and girls--the youngest of the group hard- iI ly too old yet to Lave worn dresses like his I sister. I  Eery thing was ready. - Two of the young I men sprang into the boat, crowding off shore with their oars, others running knee-deep into the water to give them a push. Rowing away from land, they began paying out the seine as tthey went, till they had made a pretty large cir- rcuit, spreading their treacherous snare; then returning, and dividing into two parties at the  two extremities of the seine, ttley all began to drag it slowly in, with 'intent to scoop up the runwalry fishes and draw them in also. The element of haphlazard in the occupation is alwayss thoroughly exciting; it is doubtful'if even the oldest fisherman can look on with indif-; Ife rence just at the moment when they are haul- ing the great bagging residue of the net finally out from the mysterious water. Will it-be a good haul? What is there in that great dark I mass, only dimly seen in the cloardy twilight? It is a joint raffle' into which they are all tempt- ied by the beckoning sea; but then site makes no Guaranty to them, that they shall certainly win  tile prize. After much toil, the great drag was gathered in. Up it came from the water, and was drawn safely out upon the sands. It wasa not at all too heavy;i it could hardly be that, under any cir- cumstances-at least so they all thought at the moment. Every body clustered about eagerly to note the contents--one with a lantern in hand-and every body bent over, looking close- ly and curiously. Then there went up a gener- al shout of laughter, very good-natured in tlhe main, but with a slightly cynical under-tone in one or two voices of men rather more intent upon business than amusement. Out from the midst of a large, loose! bundle of sea-weed and riffraff, jumped one patriarebhal crab; followeci bv four frantic silvery flshes--none of them longer than the hands, of the little children which were reached out eagerly to seize them. "Well', well! It's the mountain and the mouse undergoing a salt-water christening, ain't it?" haid Mr. Dennis, shambling up just in time to witness the denouement. "The whole sea can spawn us one crab and these four scaly s hiners-ecan't it?3 Ha, ha, ha I That's luck, now, just about equal to mine generally." Nesver mind, Job t better luck next time!" said oneobf the young men, givingJ Mr. Dennis a Sounding slap upon the shoulder. "Ceriain! always feel that."    <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5826-00000061"/> You'll be -here to pull, you know." "Not longli I'maaman ofbusiness, and can't stop above twenty minutes to watch other; folk's failures."I "Stay and help two hours, and I promise' you a, pair of flounders, Job-one apiece for your breakfast and Jedidahi's--besides a famous tautaug for dinner, and six bass--if we catch tem.1 9 St Couldni Jim, not by any possibility."

I ain't a-going to be married, you may gu any thing else; but it's a call of Providence t hat'I'm attending to.", WhaVht ul you bet, Job,? : Ninety pounds of fish solid at the next haul, eh?"' said another. IINot it, ) said Mr. IDennis, sitting down de- liberately,, ready to free it done. "Do you take me up?" LNo, I don't.") "Why, I wonder?" "I never bet against a chance that -has a hand in it stronger than yourn or mine," said  Mr. Dennis, 11 though I don't expect, e'ither, that He would turn over so-much as his little finger to give either of us a rap, if I did; but if you do get ninety pounds, Zephatniah--tell you what --I'll eat 'em, only give me a chance." "Come, comet. don't stand gabbing with Job,"' cried Captain Patter-familias. IIIt's time to be off. The hull of us won't deserve nine pounds, at this rate, for the full night's work, and to-morrow's added, to boot. Heave oft, now!" They did heave off with a will. Nothing' daunted by at bad beginning, the fishermen all  returned to the matter in hand with fresh vigor; and the whole process of drawing the seine was;: repeated, except that this time it was pulled in  more and more slowly, at the close, and with a / kind of tender, solicitous care as though there: I was felt to be a good deal at stake. It was ev-!  ident, even to an inexperienced looker-on, that' I they were all working with a better heart than when they drew it up before. They stepped about. like people with an expectation andI a certainty. of not meeting with disappoint- i melnt.                   i The mass that came up out of the water this r time -was not a great deal larger tlhan before, I but it was certainly harder hauling, and the C' men drew it higher up along the sore.  Un- 1, mistakably, it was till alive., There was a won- 'N derful. popping to and fro and upland down, and t great shining, scaly things were gleaming in the I lamp-light everywhere among the tangled inesh- I   les. Even the. juvenile moon, looking down from the sky over the Western -sand-hills, a ;so full of a kindred sympathy with the fisher- men, that she couldn't resist the temptation to Look suddenly- out from behind her cloud, for the first time that evening. Possibly her sym- Ipathy may have been with the fishes, for she lighted them all up with a beauty which they could hardly have worn even in their more pros. perous days. "AlYou've done it, Zephaniah!" bawled Mr. ,eaennis, still sitting off upon the 'salnds, or, rather, lying all along shore, resting upon o - elbow. 'CTlhere'sninety pounds good." "'Eat uni, will ye, Job?" said Zephlaniab, snapping the fingers of his left hand in the face of Mr. Dennis, as they came near, while he still tugged manfully with his right hand. "'There's provender for a cruise to Greenlandl, and not a bite comes between your teeth, old feller, to pay for Vvina there." 'rDon't matter," answered Mr. Dennis, plac- idly, rolling himself a little out of the way when one of the other youngsters made a feint of throwing the seine over him. "If enough is as good as a feast, then more team to that load wouldn't be any work of mercy. - I never cal- culatetospendniy stren-ith foi-notliing. 'Taint good economy, You see, boys." "No more'taint. I'll be economical, you'll see, Job!" Do II That's one of my bobbies, and I'm very fond of pitching it on to the toes of all young pecople." Every barly crowded, round now, and words were as plentiful as flsh--too abundant to at. tempt to gather them up in our haste, while tlhe poor fish are waiting attention. There are as many as twenty beautifill creatures of half a 'dozen different varieties, and not one of them Very patiently bearing the burden of suffering which bas been so suddenly laid upon them.- Anne and Fannie, who at last bave drawn near with the rest, are looking on with mingled pity and admiration, and the other children are ei- ther more chniyy of manifesting- feeling, or real- ly more indifferent; but one little fellow, who is laughing and peering over curiously, comes very near paying dearly for his thduughtlessness. The fish are still flonndering about, and one large black fellow, in his desperation, leaps stid- denly-up into the very face of the boy, almost knocking him over. He is sent reeling back- ward in a fright, and with, much more baste than is at all agreeable. Hapless tautaug!! Even his Janst despairing protest, is of no avO l He falls back upon the sands, gasping like the   others, which are all lifting up their gills spas- modicathy and flopping about more and more feebly as life ebbs slowly away. 9 4Now boys, lively there! You must catch your fish now as you would drive filll tilt after a gray rabbit on the run--if you want to find )em plenty, and no mistake." "Yes, capting, ready!" (LThere, then, don't tangle the seine!" "No, it's all straight." "Pustl off!" They had made, very short work of it, tossing out their booty upon the beach in 'careless haste, after the first moment of curious, delighted in. spection, and were already casting off the, seine again wittl vigorous hands and jubilant hearts. "What a difference it does make which foot you put the shoe on, don't it?" remarked Mr. Dennis to the audience, principally children, who werle till standing about him. LThese fish, iiow,,, liven't any feet, to be sure, and they can't wear shoes, tight or loose; but I expect it rnakes all the odds to them, all the same, wheth- er it's they that go fishing themselves, or wheth- er they get fished. 'Taint easy breathing now, to any of these." No, " said Anne, very sorlrowfully. Some of the others laughrled at "oldd Job's finilny talk," as usual. Frank, seeing that there was some speechifying to be done, came back to listen ; and the other men, who hand nothing to do till the boat returned, gathered about also. Tile ,audience thus reinforced, the speaker him- self was stimulated to proceed. "You see these big flsh can cat the little ones, and no conscience about it; and .we all know there's a mighty host of sharp-jatwed mon- sters out in that sea, who could cat up ttlese here fine fellows-your ten and twenty pound- ers-ast a mouthful, or two at--most. It would be only a kind of little lunch corning itl between breakfast and tea, likely. I expect they don't- have any kind of regular meals--the savages-- out there in the middle of the ocean ; anyhow, boys, that's my notion. Fishes'are fishes; nev- er dainty as to dishes; but theyv all have an ap- petite, keen every hour to snatch a bite." "Rnight, too, Job. Don'tyou say so?" "Well, yes. I judge so-; since it's likely that they all follow pretty closely to the lead- ings of the nature that's give them., I ni ust ap- prove, you know, provided they haven't mind enough to work out any better way by experi- ence. I don't quarrel with a thistle for being a thistle. Such scaly fellows couldn't very well contrive to hand down their knowledge to pos- terity, even if they did gain. it--could they, now?   It appears they would have to invent some way of writing it-down--some process that wouldn t get washed away in the water, eh?" "Did you ever hear about Mr. Darwin's fa- mous theory of natural selection, Mr. Dennis?" asked Frank, a gleam of satisfaction lighting up his boyish eyes, expressive of a sentiment kin-- dred to one uttered by a young fisherman to another, sotto voce.' Golly! Job's getting up on his high horse, aikthe'1" Wecll, yes, young man. I've read a little  about that in the newspapers, and so on. I al- lus taike'-he Weeklyl Tr un; and I've read a good many things, first iih last, in different houses here on the island, wherer they take 'pa-- pers of other sor dama   in,,inter-time, yowl know, when the esn-rat cil, to be bulay- so I have heard of that scheme for manefarctor-4. ing men, and elephants, and rattlesnrtkes all out of fisbes--going off on different tacks tecqo it-thhree spokes growing out of the same hub-, at the centre, and other spokes runtling all round, ydu know." "'Well?" said Frank, with a stimulative cm- plinsis, as the man camne to a sudden pause. CBelieve it?" asked a young sailor, still more eagerly. Why not, JTob T1 I' don't think much of that scheme-not for any thing that can be handed down inltellectool- ly. Course, inherited traits would give a bent to a man, and quicken what's already there, and in him, once for all. You see they do in a familyy, and in a nation; and that theory's good for bringiing out a bull-dog, or a poodle, or a KlingJ Charles's spaniel. Wherever any thing gets a start, it keeps it, most likely. Thlat's na- tUre0. B-ut Nature don't makko an inkstand out of a cow's horn. That's marn's work. No more does Nature make a live creetur out of a stone, nor yet one live creetur out of another. I nev. er heard of the old lady's mixing up things in -that way-anywhere else.  Her fire is al- lus flre, and her water's water; and if you go a leetle deeper, her carbon's. allus carbon, and her hydrogen, bydrogen-and all that.

G Go on, Job," said Captain Pater-farnilias; lifting a warning finger to the boys to guard against further interruption. "Have it out! Quick. now! They're coming bhack.'l "Well, capting," resumed Mr. DLennis, with    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5826-00000062"/> the coolest deliberation, eving the returning boat closely to calculate just liow much time he real- ly had to himself; "'there aint any outward. bound train that I could ever ride out on with my eyes both, open--starting out from sea-wig. glers of any sort, big or little-taking 'em, if you will, not a grain more alive and form-like than that splash of white jelly there, just coming, up here on the back of that wave--"Mr. Dennis here lifted himself up on his feet and hands, and hopped out briskly, making a dive at the jelly-, fish, which he brought up, triumphantly in his hand, standing upright-"L there aint a starting- point like this now, and any hair-splitting line of possibility running out from it, when I've follow- ed it to the end, that I over could persuade my- self brought us up at a shoal of whales here, a tribe of alligators there, and a great nest of fat" clams in another place." II Should say so." is Well, so shoulld 1; annd it takes a very learned man, ybu know, to say any other ways. What puzzles me to decide, is whether every thing is alive, or whettler nothing is alive, real. ly, you know; but only jerky-like, and made to get up a kind of feeling that it is alive under some right set of circumstances, you know. If life is any thing worth having, I guess Providence niebbe, took as much pains to make a mosquito a musqluito, and an elephant an elephant-to' say nothing of making a man a man--once for all-as he did to make a chunk of gold, gold-- no matter whether it's big or little; and iron, allus iron, no matter what use you put it to, or 1 how many shapes you contrive to bring it out' in. I've flo notion of believing that one of these 1' 'here fishes will ever be laying down the law, i or even trying to, to a lot of curious-thinking i beings like us--not if lie lives to all eternity- as I think he will--what's more." II WThat, Job I are you in earnest now?" I it Certain, my boy."I i' Well, heave ahead.."i "This is the long and short of it, then, and I've I  done. It appearrs to me that a fish is a fish 4j  himself, and nobody else--and will stay so, like. ly-, now and forever. I don't want to kill any  of these fellows o ff--not fairly, even in this  world, if I could manage cleverly to get on  without; but when I see it is ordained we shall cat and be eaten, all round, I do it with a clear  conscience, though I do get a little squeamish  i about it at times. I'd allus rather'go out fair c and square, with hook and line, instead of going I at it wholesale,a as w  do to-night.

Any way, I don't want to kill him' for good and I Iallq and clean take away his whole chance of being comfortable. r' But you do, Job." B  No, I don't, boy, I calculate. It stands to reason that all these here will wakeup fishes in s ' some better sea, and, likely, float about there in Endless contentment. There's room enough, to be sure,, somewhere--musi be!" 3 - There, Job, that will do. Now, boys! Eve ' body sprang hastily to his post. "Well, now, I'm off, for certain," said 1Mr. Dennis, gathering himself into walking order. "Here's a fishl,' Job, for the preachmllent, 1 said 6one of the sons of Pater-familias, tossing one of the largest bass after him as he went. "No, I never take pay-for the gift of g5ab, and I won't baave it!" LBut you m ust i"called several voices. Can't carry it, and don't want it, neither. I'm going out myself to try my luck, fil'st good chance," called back the man from over his shoulder as lie went loping off. "That Job's a cute follow, after all," said Zephaniah to Alfred. "He's worth his weight in fresh codfish any day," answered Alfred; who had stood listening: with a flashing eye, and a pleased, wondering look, as though all this opened a new line of thought to him. Then every body gave undi. vided attention to the drawing in of the seine; but Job went on his way, making a congac as be passed Mr. and Mrs. Warner, and thinking abibat waving his hand to Margauret, who sat perched farther away on the top of a stone fence near the house. He concluded that she was too fak off, and didn't do it; but his thoughts went floating away instead into rather misty speciula.; tions as to womankind generally; and he rather assented to himself that he would like to have known just such a girl as Margriret when he wns fifteen years younger. Now it was too late, of course. The men bad made another "good ban], " and they began to throw oht the seine again without loss of time-all wonderfully exhila- rated. Once more they were workingS diligently too draw it in, now for the fourth time. It seemed very fall and heavy; they began to look in each othcr's faces, but without a word spoken. Would the net break, and the whole contents be turned loose again into the sea?"Carefal, careful!" went round in a whisper; and the old fisherman shook his head, looking sternly into   the sea. Frank puzzled over the meaning of this odd expression of mingled regret and up. braiding, but could make nothing of it, rand waited. The strong net held together till the great floundering mass was drawn out of the water amidst short, dissatisfied growls from the elders, and little wondering screams of delight from the children. The men all stood looking with tile coolest deliberation, yet without opening the seine. II We've zone and done it!" said Ji M- dog- gedly.  IIWhat's wrong?" asked Frank. "We'll see!" was the' old man's slow and placid answer, beginning to open the net. "Sharks!" muttered a largo boy, jogging Frank's elbow. "Sharks?" echoed Frank, as mueh aston- ished a s hie could Ilave been if the boy had said' alligators instead. "Three, six, nine, thirteen. Thlirteen white sharks, young man," said Pater-familias in the tones of an oracle. He looked into Frank's ftice now witliaagleam of satisfaction. "We've got the fellows--so many of them, at any rate." RL eal sharks, captain?" "Realsharks! can'tyouseethoni? White sharks, to be sure; but your folks must keep out of the water for a week to come, if you don't want a child's toe bit off, or worse, maybe. These critters don't do much harm, generally; but it won't do to trust 'cm. Thev've come in  here fishi Xg like the rest of us. Itts eat, or 'be eaten, from, top to bottom, as Job, says." "Butl you don't eat these things?"' said Frankl, in excessive disgust. We don't direct, but we shall tuck 'cm in under the corn, and some of us, most likely, II eat 'cm second-hand next year. It comes to about the same, a little disguised." 'Do these things come here often, then T' No t very often-generally abou t this season. I 'spose they are swimming round fart er out, most generally. It stops the seining for to. night; but we've no cause to complain s it is." Human voices were mingling now io a gen- eral hum, hardly to be distinguished fom the ceaseless- protest of the sea itself. Every' wave must have its own story; but talking all togeth4 er, no one yet has been able to interpret the confused language of the waters. Frank saw that the fish were being assorted-the good on   the right band, and the 'bad oh the left--these sheep and goats of the sea-and ttlere was Some question as to the fair distribution of :1prizes s t  ater-familias finally divided them into shares, trwith which every body seemed satisfied, and jFrank was not forgotten by him. "You've C helped us with 'a will, and deserve a part of the bootyy" he said, handing them over. "I bad rather not, sir; -they are entirely yours.") "But you must, you know, " persisted the generous old man, putting them in a basket and Hnnding them over again imperatively. I  Thank you, then, I will," said Frank, heart. ily, feeling at once that this was the right thing to do. L'Only this large fellow must go back again into your pile, captain." ttNo, I won't have it!"But Frrank had 'tossed it over as he spoke; and now with a boyish laugh he ran out of Ireach, keeping him- Iself giood-hurnoredly aloof. Fifteen minutes :'later, when they were all trudging homoewlrd,, Frank no soonerienltered his own door-yard t han the big fish cime tumbling after him head- long. "Takse that in, will you, young capting?"' clllled the old gentleman, with a cheeriness of tone worthy of Captain Giles biniselfi Indeed, Pater-familias was one of the hundred recmote cousins of our old, captain, and with a pretty marked vein of family likeness. The young gentleman picked up the scaly monster, rather proud, on the whole, to exhibit it ars'his own lawful prize; but not without a warm word of praise in favor of retiredd old sea-captains in gien- eral. At least, such as had fallen under his eye in this rural neighborhood were all very good models, he most implicitly -believed. What Margaret thought about all that even- ing, she never could tell you ; and I -certainly shall not make the attempt. When the rest came home, she was in bed--her eyes closed too securely to be disturbed by the children, who looked into her room, whispering one to the oth-- er, "She's fast asleep."But sleep, like silver and gold, is much too closely related to a great many other good things to be always found the moment it is sought after. Margaret didn't overtake it till the next day, witlr its clearer, Vision, began to look in upon hers with wonder. ing remonstrances. Tben' she slept till nearly noon, and -was greatly refreshed.    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5826-00000063"/> CHAPTER XXX. DROt'GHT AND) DRENCHING.,   XICANK bad perched himself upon a stone wall, and sat looking: off over the sea, whistling, and rather wishing for something to do. I'Eh, young gentleman," said Mr. Dennis, lounging past with his fishing gear on his shoul. der, "'powerful hot, ain't it?" "Hot, hotter, hottest of the season, at any rateC. " 'You might toast eggs anywhere in the sand I've just been walking over, I reckon. If I'd hadc 'cm handy, I should have got dinner for. myself, sir." "Any fish to broil?" LWell, no; can't say L have." H'Iow is that?" 'They say heat's a mode of motion; but I think it's a mode of stopping motion," said Mr. Dennis, ignoring Frank's question, and spread- ing himself at half-length, with the wall for a chair-back. "Who rowed out with you this morning, Mr. Dennis V" "I plucked little' Mraybough from his father's garden as I went along; but he was in a stew to get back to the potato digging. Strange I some boys are like beans and corn, and -such things; there's, only one point for them to grow from, andi they must sprout out on just that side, or nowhere. I like a boy with ambition saved up) in snug little parcels on all sides of him every separate bundle really to grow first chance --like all the eyes of a potato." "But boys don't exactly have the privilege  of making themselves, I suppose?" "I'spose not. And some start too early, and the shots, get rubbed off and go to loss, maybe. If I'd had the making of myself, I shouldn't have cared to put in more eyes to girow from, but I should have piled in the rawI material enormously, so as to make the growthI worth having. You see," he added, confiden.  tiall t III can always put out a leaf or-two most anywhere, but not one of the branches that seems 'to bear much fruitage. That's my style, I ex-,    pect, andldon'tworry-no use,youknow! It's Providence that is the responsible party hii that boat, and that's a comfort to fall back upon." Mr. Dennis emphasized his conclusion by sNyy ing round and falling back af full length ong the wall, with his face turned resignedly heav- r nwakd. 1-11 might kick against these heavy stones, but likely I should only end byv upset. Citing them upon my flesh and bones to my cost. I Better to lay alongside and. make use of the narrow strip of shade they are kind enough to offer." IIYes, " said Frank, "I suppose so." "Time fixed for going to Boston?" asked Mr. Dennis, with a sudden change of tone, fol- lowing a grimace and a gesture, to indicate that the other topic was finally disposed of and laidi on one side. He sat up now and looked inquir-; ingly. "'Not exactly flxed yet, but I suppose in an- other week or two." It will be pleasant here for a month yet." 1L] know it will, but we are already staying longer than we expected. I've got a substitute over there in the tread-mill, but it's about time forme-cto step into my own shoes and begin to plod on in the old track." ' Is, hey? Wel,jahouldn't care to change with yous; I'd rather trot on in my clod-hopper shoe." ",I sympathize with the sentiment, Air. Den. nis," laughed Frank, with a despairing shrug of the shoulders. "I've taken a good deal of the gypsy color on my face this summer; but that's nothing to the spirit of gypsying that, has. fairly taken possession of me. ie's getting to be dang;erous." 41I half think it is) I said Mr. Dennis, with a grin; "but 'taint an improvement to inocu- late a tame olive with the wild vine. Duty is duty, I 'rspose, the world over." "'I expect it is, but duty is black and blue quite as often na any other color, helre in this world, isn't it?"   "'Very likely; but then it changes its com- plexion easily. That's a comfort. - Changes tire mostly good. Providence always keeps a ----ling-stick to keep things moving with. Th'is ::;`d is pretty black in winter-, and it's pretty ra, n and bare with all the drought we've had hatecly; but we see plenty of tallish changes once in a while, I can tell you; and we are go- ing, to see one now before we are twenty-four hours older." "Are we? Wmhat kind?" "Storm and bluster. If I'm a judge tlhere's a falmous rare drink brewing in the, island tea- pot. Don't you smell it in the air? Don't you see the hot steam of it in the sky? Wlly the signs of it are folded up in the curl of every blade of dry grass." Mr. Dennis clambered up and sat arstridetthe stone fence, like one who has resolutely mount- ed his hobby and means to ride it. "It's written out there all over the sea that there's coming-one of the finest storms that you ever sawyoung man. Every wave there is ly- ing low-just 'now, but like a tiger-cat, it is get- ting readyto spring; and to-morrow, at latest, they'll come roaring up on to the, shore, fierce enough to tear down the highest cliffs." II Will they?3"  Frank's eye went off over the sleeping waters, and then ca me back, fasten. ing incredulously on the face of his compan- ion, "It's just certain they will. Sea, earth, and air are all too still. They'll wake at once with a firenzied will." "Then I'll remember you as a prophet." ",Psbaw! Every thing is telling it. Them little water-birds over there,' one minute sitting like mummies, and the next flapping about gid- dy, like a hen with her head cut off; they know it. Don't you see how every little cloud over- head curls up scornfully when' the sta; tries to banke 'er to a crisp? They all know that the sun will have his match before long. That's one reason why I got off the sea without to o much waiting, for times are a little uncertain in such a case." 4 Well, hurrah for the tempest. It's about time it came; but I don't see exactly what's to be done about it-." "Only just to set your house in order if there's any thing to be done. You ought to have ev- ery thing tight-your folks at home-and snug  to hold water, 'for tubs, and cisterns, and such, are given to leak after A long dry, spell." "Whew! I hope not. Mother would be in despair if main-water were to run away after itI onceC got here."   "Of course; so, would any woman. That's 3the nature of women." L "Is it?" said Frank, lookingmystified. 3 Water enough has been our one want half rthe sulnmer." I  So I epected.. Better let me go p, then, iand tighten the rain-hogshead ; it looked shakyi kinder, the other day, 'and I've had it on- my mind ever since." Suiting the action to the -word, he took up his fishing-trps and marched forward, followed by Frank, who came on making grimaces to himself, like a small boy dragged out of a very comfortable position rather against II's own will. The next move, Mr. Dennis was simmering away vigorously at a huge water-butt standing under the eaves of the house, much to the sur- prise of Mrs. Warner, who began to telegraph frm the open window to her son, but without being Ithle to gain his attention. "I tell you," said Mr. Dennis, "if this weather went on much longer'we should allfall into staves. I've felt myself giving way this week past, and this 'ere hogshead's in just the same condition." "Not a bad figure," thought-Mrs."WaVrner, smiling, and seating herself behind the curtain to hear what nextr. 'Mothelr and Margaret Hill rain benedictions on your head then, I am surec, if you can man- age to make it water-proofi" "I am afraid we should have to," thought Mrs. Warner, from the inside of the curtain, if there really comes any rain to fill it." "Cetan,-answered the long figure outside, passing to speak witfi an uplifted mallet, and bringing it down afterwards by way of empha- sis. "Just as I said; that's the nature of women. A woman is relatedl to water more closely than ally other being in -existence, ex- cept a fish. How could ladies and children get owwmithout white frocks?3 and every decent wom- an, if she's ever so poor, must have one garment at least washed as white as water can make it. Then they couldn't live without a cup of tea; and what'saacup of tea withollttwater?  T here's nothing like water for every mother's daughter." "Not bad, again," smiled Mrs. Warner., (,II begin to see why Fra'rnk likes him." Whang, whan&amp; whangl bang, bang, bangl went the cooper outside, with speechless zeal; and then his speech began again while he rested.. "A man, now, could manage to do without water for a month together, and be comfortable. The outside don't matter much to him-unless he's a young gentleman just in the first stages of filling into love--and he can make do for    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5826-00000064"/> the inside with the strong waters that we] 1-up from black bottles." The pounding went on now without interrup- tion till te work was done, and then the work. man, first looking earnestly at Frank toarrest his attention, dropped his eyes, and said, in a low, steady tone, "I drank pretty deep at that bottle-spring in my early days, young gentleman. It's all over now; but I 'spose that's why I'm a bachelor to this day." "Indeed!" said Frank, rather embarrassed at the confession, respecting Mr. Dennis all the Tiiore for it, but not knowirng exactly what to say. "I am glad that's well over." "It's well over." "But it's never too late, you know, Dennis, to make a final move in the direction of matri- mony," recovering himself, and speaking cheer- fully. "Sometimes it is too early, though, young man, to make a 'move towards any thing so final as that, 1 said Mr. Dennis, peering good-natured- ly into the lad's blushing face. 'Is it?" "Yes; I've seen that proved a score of times. It takes the steady use of a good deal of sharp eyesight to become a good j'udgie even ofhorses; and you want to see 'em. working in the harness, 'as well as out in the pasture ca- pering." It may be well to say that Mr. Dennis thought  Frank was getting a little fascinated with Mary  Percy, and she was not his favorite. Mrs. War.  ner thought he referred to Totum, who was not her favorite, and she could willingly have shaken  hands with Mr. Dennis very cordially, if a good opportunity had offered. "NoWP that tub is warranted to stand on itsI own bottom, I said Mr. Dennis, "and I'll go  about my, own business again," shouldering his  fishing-gear, and tramping off, chuckling to  himself at the remembrance of the boy's peony.  colored face.    IHe's an honest, nice boy!" mused the man,  thoughtfully, as he slouched on homeward, a lit- c tle depressed in spirits as he thought of himself I and his perpetual bachelorhood.  14 1 wish ]him t well, and a wife at last, whose wayss are as good t for his constitution as Jedida's are for mine. s Better not marry at all than mated criss-cross. I'm well enough content."          P Down came the rain, and a gust of wind sent a him  stumbling fonvard at a pace which broke ti tip till his matrimonial reveries without more g delay.                    b 'I thought so!" ejaculated Mr. Dennis, in a, o   p tone of triumph, and his long legs took him for- ward so rapidly, that he was soon at home. I-"Whatever did make you just ten minutes ;-too late, JobZ" asked his sister, meeting hin, -t at the open door. "Stand there a little, and a take off the wet coat and boots. In that state you would go dripping over the floor U6k a a house-mop that hasn't been wrung out after it r is dipped in the water-pail.  Couldn't you bave D seen the signs of the weather, and contrived to make a little time in getting here?" I "Well, Jedida, perhapss Imight. I was look. a ing out for it, but it came of a sudden at the,' last end, as bad luck generally does. We won't cry for spilt water; but I'll read the paper loud, and we'll have a cozy afternoon. It won't stop raining for to-day." Mrs. Warner, going in to her husband, who was enjoying: the parlor -lounge, woke him up with a description of Mr. Dennis and his say. ings; and both seemed unexpectedly edified. "I suppose there is a good, deal more under the rough outside of these country people thanl we have ever given them credit for, 9 said Mr. Warner, thoughtfully, When the wind and rain -came battling down filriously, apparently on all sides of the house at once,'dropping, as it seemed to them, -like'an unexpected good gift out of a dry, hot skyv the queer man, who seemed almost to have fore- ordered it, came somehow to be confusedly as- sociated in their minds as a family benefactor; and subsequent events only fixed and deepened the impression. The torrent of rain fell without intertiption till the afternoon of the next day3.  Every wi n- do* was soon beaded with shining large drops, as though each separate pane had been profuse- ly ornamented with pearls. How the water contrived to penetrate where apparently there was noaperture was a mystery; yet there it was, oozing, dripping, and bubbling from every casement on all the four sides of the house, to the no snlall wonderment and amusement both ofthe children and the grown people. Everyv one slept soundly that night through all the hurly-huurly of the tempest - and next morning the waves 'were rolling inland, apparently higher than the cliffs,, but breaking far out at sea, and so coming more modestly in-shore. Towsards evening the sky cleared with a dis- play of rainbows, and then the whole family, and, indeed, almost the whole community,, turned out en masse, seeking for the most eli- gible places along the shore, where they could best command the sea. The highest of -the outlying rocks was covered with water; but   now and then it -could be seen to peep through thec churning spray, as though it, too, was cu- rious to obtain a, look-ont upon the unusual scene. The waves covered the beach, and rolled half-way up the cliffs, foaming and tum- bling gfloriously--one mass of confused, surg l ing, creamy foam. Farther out yon could count six long lines of distant breakers, troop- ing in one behind another, and breaking all nearly at once. 'These six files of dashing ivhite mountains, changing every moment,-but keeping up the succession with wonderful regu- larity, were -all that could be desired in that line. Occasionally the whole got chopped to- gether in one white, boiling, tumultuous mass. "It is worth a whole summer spent hero to see just this!" said Mr. Warner, emphatic. ally. '( I have never known the tide to rise higher in my whole life," said Captalin Giles, coming up at the moment in his shirt sleevesfollowed by a throng of men and boys. "We? must looki out for the boats; and the boat-houses even are ia danger." Awaly tltey all hurried, busy and excited. The wind, which had been all day blowing inland, now suddenly changed, blowing directly out to sea, meeting everyS wave os it broke, and,   filling the air with flying white foam glittering with sunshine.  "There is a large boat over yonder,- broken, and drifting upside down., They are trying to secure it; but in another wave or two of such churning as it gets, it, will be split into frag-i ments," cried Frnnk,. coming up, with shining: eyes, and very red in the face. The water has dashed up quite aroundflour; bath-house once or twice. I expect that will go, mother; but it's worth it, if nobody is drowned." "But is it certain that nobody is drowned. WChat kind of a boat is it?" "A fisherman's; and there seems to be a net dragging after it. I'm off again! Good-bye." The run sank lower and lower in the west, till the arrows of golden sunshine were shot al- most horizontally through the leaping mist and spray above the water; and gradually the whole scene was, shrouded in a weird, phantom -like illusion of unreality. The darkness fell thick. and Iheavy; yet excited voices were still healrd shooting, here and there, in the distance, above the din of the ocean and the steady soughing of the wind. This was Totum's birthday; -and she regard-l ed the whole magnificent display as got up in special honor of-that event.   CHAPTER XXXL THE CHLDREN S DAY.   Tiin changes along the coast, produced by thbe storm, were a source of perpetual interest for the next several days. One morning Mid- get and Edgalr Percy invited Ginnie to go with them to the Herring Creek. M1s. Warner, who thought the gentle dumb boy would be a safe guide, readily gave her consent, and a fdw small cakes and sundries ats an outfit for a shore II din- ner-party;" and the children, who had permis- sion to remain till about noon, discovering a country-wagonn headed in the right direction, rann off in haste to secure the pleasure of a ride. They journeyed across the flats in high spirits, tile girls chatting freely with the good-natured farmer who drove them; and when near the creek all three alighted, and walked down to the shore--the mdan continuing Iris way along the downs. Herringi Creels, which is a little outlet to the poand, bad been recently cleared from obstruct tions; send, when last seen'by the children, a bright little stream was running freely into the   sea, wh che they bad found it difficult to cross in passing along the beach. Tro-day the open- ing was entirely choked up again with sand and pebbles, and all communication cut off. for the present between pond and ocean. It was a dis- appointment. I'sn't it too bad, " said Fannie, sorrowfully - "it was such a nice 'little river, and I liked it's "It- isn't a bit pretty here any longer," said Midget, inaavexed and disappointedtone.- "Lete us go over to the point where the fence and the big rocks are, and have our te a-party there." The little brown fingers were quickly busy in expressing her wishes to Edgar, who readily as. sented. Midget was his favorite, because sheo had learned to talk with him. F'annie could only express her sympathy and indicate 6rr wishes by looks and gestures; but even she was learning to laboriously sell out the deaf andl dumb alphabet with her right band. It was a cool1 day, with a rising wind, stirrhig3 in them all a spirit of adventure and feelings of    <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5826-00000065"/> unusually vigorous enjoyment. E dgar, whose eyes were generally quick enough to atone for any want of hearing, clambered up the side of cliff, and soon came down a ain, bringing with him two or three sparkling clusters of iron py- rites. This was something now. The rain hav- ing washed the,bank, he saw them standing out like bright little balls in the midst of the clay. "gob they are diamonds, maybee" suggested IMidget. "No, I have seen diamonds, and these are not a bit like them, said Fannie. "Wll, they are so bright, I do believe they are diamonds, or el-se something just as nice, perhapss" persisted Midiget. "Let's find. some more." They all went to searching- gleefully - clam- bering, slipping, and now and then getting a tuinble or a bruise; but finding wonderful treasures just often enough to afford ample compensation. IHere's a nice beautiful little fluted roll, ly- ing right here at the foot of this mountain, shouted Fannie,. excitedly. Wihen the others ran up to see, she held up in triumph one of the finest, though most irreg- ular, of the specimens they had yet collected. "Oh, it is beautiful!" echoed Midget,. with a frank admiration, while her eyes ran longing- ly up the wonderffil, treasure-bearing cliff. No pearl-diver ever peered through the deep waters with a more intent hope of finding a valuable prize. They had been wandering ona good while now without finding any thing, and were'nearly Ready to give up the search- in favor of treasures more easily obtained.; but this new gem of beau. ty put all that out of the question. II Oh, there's something!"Midget exclaimed i suddenly; ",something as bright'as silver, stick.  ing, up there in the bank; and here are little shining silver things scattered all down below it. Only look Hlook!" IIOh I oh I oh!" roared Fannie, clapping and  jum'ping.  Ed ar's eves brightens(]) and grew twice their usualsize.  Thenhe-clainberedupa'nd-'brought i dodwn the treasure with the utmost calie. It bad c originally been, a nearly round ballof radiated  iron some two inches in diameter, the, rays run. ning: out from, a- clayey nucleus; but about half of it had fallen -asunderi scattering the broad  steel-colored needles all down the face' of the cliff,  These they gathered with unabated ar. tj dor; for all the mines of Golconda could hardly s l have given either of the three any greater sat- d isfahction.   WChen they reached the shore-fence and the ir large rocks for which they bad originally started f from the Herring Creek;, they were all eager to go farther. Clambering over by mutual con- sent, they listened awhile to the peculiar ad- b esive click and slip of the tide as it rolled ,t down from the steep bank of large pebbles and stones on the farther side;, and then went on 1 again, admiring the many-colored ochreous, Cliffs, which were all unusually bright after the a late energetic scouring with sea-water. The clays and sands Wvhich lie in thin, irreg- ular strata, had been- unevenly washed away by the storm, till the whole extent of dliff, running on for miles, was smoothly- carved into curious fantastic lines and shapes. Here a cave or a- basin was scooped out near the bottom, there Another, higher up. Farther on was a long, I broad cornice, many-bued, and almost as regu- lar in its construction as though it had been planed and grooved by machinery ; -and again, there were ornamecnted columns rising up from the level beach, many feet- above their heads;- to the high -:%ater mark of that stormy tide which bad wrought out all these beautiful forms. Nothing; at thl like this was to be found near' home - the shore-banks there, composed less of clay, had crumbled away with more of wreck and less of beauty than they found' everywhere helre. No wonder that the proposed tea-party and every thing absent was forgotten,ylifle the children ran on with ever-increasing delight and admiration. After a while they came to where there was * broad cave-like platform in the bank, about * third of'the way upfroni'the bottom. The waves hand washed tho lighter soil out from above, leaving a wide, ample ledge of hard- ened clay, half overhangt by a projecting clayey roof. Edgar, whose prudence began to wake up, pointed enthusiastically to this high platform, and indicated, that baying seen that, it was enough. They should be content, and -turn bazck at once. "'Why,thhat'saareal dining'.rom,"cried Ean- nie, dancingablout witlidelight. "'Do let's Iiave our picnic up there, Midget. Won't it be splen- did?" W'on't it be: splendid?" echoed Midget; "but let us get some more shells first, so as to havre plenty of dishes for the dinner-party." The boy was so delighted with their delight that all his newly-awakened prudence went to sleep again. Theyv had come out to have a dinner-party, and of course they must have it. ",t's just the very place for it--isn't it, Ed-   gar?"Midget had said to him; and lie smiled and nodded assent- as cordially as Midget could wish. The shell-dishes were speedily gathered by willing bandls, and they all clambered up some jagged steps to the only accessible point from below, all in a state of steadily-increasing bap' piness. "I never did have a dinner-party in such a beautiful dining-room before!" cried Midget, prancing over the smooth. foor likie as colt who has unexpectedly broken into a new' pasture. "Here's every thing we want; and such beau- tiful ornaments and crimson colors on the walls." "And the ocean all down there Wow us!" said Fannie. I IWouldn't papa like to take din- ner here! It's magnificentt" "Let's play that there is a, band of musicians down there making beautiful music for us while we are at the feast," suggested Midget.  It3[ sounds so-doesn't it?"   It did sound so, certainly enough. The wind and the waters together were already making ominous music, which the children little heeded, and the tide was rising rapidly. Edgar was deaf, but they were all blind. While the little souls went on laying the table, carving ducks, heath-fowl, fish, and venison--all wiitl equal fit- cility from the same small sweet-cakes and crackers-and heaping up jellies, ice-creamsr. and dainties generally with a lavish hand, the incoming wavy line of water was creeping high- er and higher along the sand; and by the time they were quite ready to begiin the eating, the triumphant waters had already cut off the pos- sibility of retreat. But they had no thought of retreat, no dream of going home yet, no sus- picion that it was already neal]y noon, and two miles at least away from homte and safety. They were hungry and happy, without a sin- gile shadow upon the brightness of the perfect present. A strong clap of thunder, followed by light-    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5826-00000066"/> ning and a sudden dash of rain, made them all rise to their feet, and stand awed and terrified -liooking first out to sea, and then into each other's 'faces. There was no -beach below them-nothing but one wild, foaming ocean of water. Fannie throw herself sobbing upon the ground without speakingf. Midget crept to Edgar's side and held his hand, with white,' quivering lips, and a stifled moan; and the poor deaf boy, holding tightly to the little girl, closed his eyes and stood there as if so he could best shut the whole fearful scene out of his consciousness. But the situation was too startling-,to be long shn-t out by a closed eyelid. He threw off Mid- get's band, andi, tossing uip his arms in a frenzy, uttered one of those awfill cries which can issue only from the throat of a deaf mute. Then lie.  ran to and fro, from side to side, looking every-I where. Fannie started up Nyith now terror, and little seven-years-old Midgiet, gathering them both in her -arms like a mother, made them sit down on either side of her. "We can't do any thing!" said the child, in r that positive tone which always makes itself 1 heeded. "IWe must sit still and wait."  "er looks and gestures were so emphatic that t tile boy understood her quite its well as the girl. b He saw that there was nothing to bedone, and e passively clasped his hands, sitting like a white statue, and making no further demonstration. b "But we shidll all be drowned, slian't; we, ft Midaet?" asked Fannie.  "I don't think we shall one bit, Fannie.  Grandpa says the waves almost never get up as ti high as this except in the very big storms, and h, this is only a little storm."         1( II Ob, I do hope it will be so!" sobbed Fan- ci nie, trying hard to be Ileroic, but hiding her face ai with a shudder in Midgect's little blue gingham fil apron.               i The waves dashed higher find higher, till they oi washedc over the ledge where- the children were, efc almost wetting their feet as they clung togethl- to or far back inthe corner.  Then Midget's eyes sil   "opened with a wide, frightened look, and her d little, frame shook with' suppressed emotion h which appalled Fannie, who cried out with new vr terror, r  Midget I oh, Midget! 'we shall be drowned! I kno*C we shall be drowned!" I "Let's just say our prayers, Fannie. That's e every thing ive can do,"' sdid Midget, struggjlingg to speak calmly, "I'm saying mine all the time," "Oh, mamma! mamma! papa! Frank!" roared Fannie.  Oh, somebody, do come and savYe us!"  "They can't help, us!" said Midget, almost indignantly; (nobody can. Nobody in the whole world but just Pod and Jesus." "But they are all'looking for us," persisted Fannie. "I know they are all looking for us everywher e. Oh,-Margaret! Margjaret! Per- haps Margaret can find us!" cried the child, starting up, and shouting tfie name again and again wildly in her terror. M\Iidgett gazedc at her at first as if stupefied. "Yes, I suppose they are looking for us, " she said at length thoughtfully, as if speaking to herself. "PYerhatps we bad better shout; that will be something to do, at any rate;" and get- ting: up, she joined her voice to Fannie's in one long cry of "C1randpapa, grandpapa!" which ecltoed above, the roar of the tempest. The poor little mute could not even shout; but lie rose up also, the tears rolling down his face, and he turned off to the wall to bido his grief from the others. After a while, IMidget, who felt that he was more to be pitied than ei- ther Facnnie or herself, drlew out\)her mite of a handkerchief froln her pocket, and after one long final shoout, while she held it in her hands, coming up to Edgasr, she put her arm about him and wiped away his tears-which flowed only the faster for all-this--and trid to comfort him. But the cru el sea had no pity. It dashed over them agjain'and again, as they clung to the cave, and to each other--too appalled now even to cry out, and altogether hopeless of any pos- sible help from man.   CHAAPTER XXXII. OUT OF THE DEEP WiATERS.   MEANTIME every body was looking for the little wanderers. At first, at Mr. Warner's, they bad all been too much eng-aged with prep- arations for leaving on the second day from this, to give much thought either to them or to the approaching storm; but as noon and the tempest both came together, yet bringing no children, the whole household became alarmed. Margaret started with umbrellas for the shore, and Framnk went over to Captain Giles's, hoping to find them there. Then the whole neighbor- hood was aroused, and looking for the lost chilE dren. It was known that they had gone -down to the beach, and now there was no -boach--nothingi but an ocean dashing matdly against the echoing cliffs. Hope wa s dying rapidly out of all hearts. Mr. Warner, wholly regardless of himself, went hastening everywhere 'in search of them ,without resting, clinging to the one hope that they had taken refuge somewhere inland. Mrs. Warner, overcome with anguish, was alone when' Totum Giles came in pale and weary. The mother, in her grief, was thinking only of her darling as perhaps already sleeping under the sullen sea, which half-maddened her with its hypocritical moaning. She started for. ward, and demanded bitterly, "Miss Giles, what has that Midget done with my child?" Poor Totum -was inexpressibly shocked, but she looked steadily, and pityingly at the almost frantic mother and suid, in a steady, low voice, II Mrs. Warner, Midget was my sister." Waas-that dreadful past tense! It told all that Totum hacl felt; and Mrs. Warner, recover- ing herself, burst into tears, the first which she had shed that day, and gathered the young girl tenderly into her arms. i'Totum, forgive me!" she said, in a humble, heart-brokenn tone. III was half-crazed. Can you forgive me, my child?"Totum clung to- her, and weptwith her till they were both much calmecr.   "Now- I will go and look for them again, Mrs. Warner. I can not rest while there is any hope," she said, returning the kiss of reconcili. ation. She went out again into the wet fields 'almost hopeless, but resolute to do something. The rain had nearly-ceased, but the wind was still loud and boisterous. Frank soon joined her, and they went on together without speak-- ing, 'Past the Herring Creek and over the heights along the edge of the cliff, looking often down fearf "Illy into the sea as they walked. "hear their voices! Oh, Frankl! Frank I They are certainly down there!" cried Totum, suddenly dragging him forward excitedly to tile edge of the brink. "Oh no, Tottim dear," he answered, pitying. ly. 1 It can't be." "But itis I There, that's Midget I Don't you heart now?" TaTke care, Totum, it is very slippery," cried Frank, holding her back with a shudder. "'I am afraid you are mistaken." II I Certainly hear them." "I hear only the angry voices of that cruel sea, dear Totum. I feel sure that they are drowned," he added in a low, awe -stricken voice. "Oh, Frank, listen i Listen steadilyl" The pair stood peering anxiously over the cliff into the boiling water below, where noth- ing was to be seen except the wet, jagged clay reaching down to the very water's edge; and, then they citing together in silent terror. There certainly were voices and childish sobs. "Frank, what is it ? Where can they beP asked Tottim, with faltering white lips. II Shall we call?" "Call, 1 whisperedl Frank-his face blanched even whiter than bers, and looking above and around him hopelessly. At this moment Job D)ennis came striding towards them at a quick pace. When Totum saw him, she sprang forward with new hope. "They are found, Job, they    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5826-00000067"/> are /[jere somewhere; but they seem to'be bur. ied up in the cliff. Oh, I am so glad you have come!" pulling him towards the slippery brink in reckless haste. "Don't yon hear them call?" "I do hear them. Facty they are down there somewhere, in some hole in the bank." He slapped vigorously upon his knee in a State of perplexity, as if at a loss what to do next. "There, catch hold- of my coat-tails, hard now, both of you," he said, it and I'll hang over and look.' Bless me, but I haven't got any coat- WISl. Takte each a hand, then, and grip now for dear life."He stretched his long arms be- -hind him, and they each seized one with a will. II You see, I don't much fancy tumbling in there headlong," he explained, leaning out over the abyss till his footing seemed precarious enough. I I can - old you, and I will, " said Frank,  who had recovered from the awful dread which had possessed him for a moment. "My feet have a firm footing. You. shan't fall." "'Say, say I Any one down there?3" called  Job, outroaring5 all the din of the tempest r "Are you children down there anywhere in theta bank?" "Yes. Yes, here we are!" came up so dis- t tinctly that they all heard. In a moment the eager face of little Edgar sl looked up from. a sharp projecting ledge, and ti Mr. Dennis saw his little hand vainly clutching at the bank 'Overheadf to steady himself.  bi "There, that'll do, boy! Don't come out tl there, I say," cried the borrifled spectator. it "Pt your head in again, boy!" and Mr. Den. tf nis wrenched away one hand firdm Totum's te- ai nacious grasp, at imminent personal peril, arw- in inghhack the child withaf lerce gesture. '-Pull d( himin,Isky,girls.  That'sright!  Don'tany a of you coine out again that way, and maybe hi tumble into the water.

There, now, tve good-bye." nk He drew back from, the brink, puffing with -m. excitement, and faced about indignantly. "There, again, Totum. Giles; you stop roar- -re ing, too! Don't let out another word, for your life. They mustn't be excited; and keep away afrom that bank, can't you?" giving her a push do which sent' her staggering backward so sudden- ly that she would have fallen if Frank bad 'not rd prevented her. "Haven't you a grain o' sense, 'er now, girl? Some of the pack of you will go Lt- sousing into that pond yet, just for the lack of iw brains; and I tell you it can't be permitted." e-No, it can't, said Erank,sogothingly. "CWe ". won't speak or look again, Dennis; only say re 'clearly what we are to do, and we'll do it." te "That's speaking Iikk' the man I took you i. for, young gentleman. You see, the storm is c, about over, and I'm most sure the water is farll. h ing. Likely we've just to wait a little, and we -t can bring them all off with a whistle, dry-sbod along the beach; but if worse comes to worse, d and the water goes on rising, you must bring ;. men here to let down ropes, and haul lem up etha)t way. You two go and tell the news, and get the rigging all provided. I'm going down the side of this hill, just over thereabouts. "Oh, don't attempt that-; you will certainly r slip, and it is better to wait," -remonstrated To. Itum. It would only be folly to slip, and it shan't be done. I shall clamber into the hole whero they are, somehow, if I can; Which I don't much'-doubt. I'm wanted there. If you let the ropes down, I must tic the young ones fast; and at any rate you could hear from the sough in their voices that they're almost scared 'to death, poor little creeters, Tllat dumb boy's awful white face, looking up like a ghost. out of his grave, will haunt me, I expect, like a year of nightmares. You've no idea how scared and wistful it was." "Poor little things" murmured Totum, struggiling with eniotion. I "There, there; don't begin that now, 1" said the man, roughly. "It won't do, you know. You see," he added, with a delighted and en- couraging grin, 11 for once in my fifet I shall be welcome somewhere, shan't IV3 MrF. Dennis bad reached the chosen point of descent. He gave a new tack to the overhauls, which were already inside of his boots, threw off his sailor's jacket, and treated himself to a general shake, by way of preparation. "Hm, hum, hum," he buzzed to himself, like a reflect. ive bee.   "There,", said he, "Lshake hands now, Miss Giles. If I do slip into the throat of that great' boiling tea-pot down there by some mistake, re- member, I didn't wish to treat you like a bear, but only to make you take good care of that slimy way that leads down to the bottomless pit. You've both had time now to get calm heads on your shoulders; but my advice is, don't go near those young ones again." "Don't you try to go to them," pleaded To- tum, clinging to the offered hand. "I really ,think it will be better that they should wait to see if the tide goes down." "'No danger, child. I have climbed here- before in all weather, and I can see the lay of the land pretty well. My foot is set in slippery places though, ch?" lie called out from' his knees, upon which he, had suddenly landed. "Shows I ought to say my prayers before, start- ing. I have said 'em, but IT ex ect not half hearty enough.. Now I'm just a leectle, siled; but can a man touch pitch and not be defiled?" -He pointed with an extraordinary grimace to the clay patches on his overhauls with a laugh which was too infectious to be resisted, after the long strain upon their nerves. "That's good!" lie added, cheerily. LNow- keep up heart, and when I reach the youngsters, I'll roar back the news, and you can both go home." A slow; toilsome, careful descent, and then his voice canie ringing up to them cheerfully, "I'm down at the bottom, safe and sound." But a great wave tumbling in towards him as be landed, he dashed forward to the ledge where the children were with a wild leap, which -left him sprawling in their midst. "Now I bave got 'em; at at single bound," be shouted spas- modically to the excited listeners overhead. Then Dennis and the childrerl all laughed and cried together. "Are they all safe, Denn is?9" calldd Frank. "'All safe-all sticking together like molas- ses-candy, and packed into ais nice a box as you ever saw. If it wasn't just a little unsafe, you should see all our heads poking out in a bunch to look up a't you ; but it can't be done. Tide has turned, and the water is going down fast.

" Well, that's all. Now don't wait. The water is falling, so no more squalling and bawl- ing. Put wings to your shoes, and fly off with the news." 'CGood-bye, then, Midget; good-bye, Tannie   and Eclaar. Don't be afraid; you'll see them all soonl," cried Totum, from the bank above. II Good - bye. Be quick about it, then; do, Totum!" squealed the imperative voice 'of lit- tle Midget in the highest excitable key, which made them both laugh nervously. TPhen Frank and\ Totuml hastened towards home, holding each other by the hand as they ratn I                I "'What an escaper and what a wPonderfull summer this has been, Totum!" said Frank, in a husky voice. . II Shall we ever forget it?" II I imagine not. A day like this, for in- stance, will get fixed in the memory like tile multiplication table, I suppose, Frank - because we shall go over it again and again, sleeping or wakking;." "'And because the trouble of to-day bas been sharp enough to eat into every one of us like an acid, engraving its own history.. I am in a state of effervescence at present that can't express it- self in anly thing quite extravagant enough to be satisfactory. We can't separate now, Totum, and then forget each other. We must be more than common friends as long as we live; for we have crowded a century of ordinary experi- ence into this summer, and shared it to'erther.") Frank's band tightened its clasp, with a lan. guage in it which spoke more than his wordss had done. OhB, I don't know." Totum answered in an indifferent tone, and managed to free .herself, under pretense of stooping to pick something from the ground. "Grandfather said yesterday that I bave had only a slice of the island-summer, and just a lit. t16i of the outside rindc of the autumn. It is won- derful how soon the flavor of the very nicest dainty seems to pass away with the next bite." "But the outside, autumn rind, at any rate, has been pungent enough to make you remem- ber it. Totum, you must promise to-correspond with me. You can do so much, at least." 4 4 No, Frank, I can not. It %wouldn't please your father and mother--nor me either," added the girl, pettishly, her eye wandering off over the sea. I Suddenly her whole manner changed. I  II ook, Frank, there I That schooner will the wrecked!" "Driving Straight 'upon the rocks," he atn- swered, both their hearts paralyzed with neov horror. II It is the stone-barge from New Bed- ford. I saw them all the morning lying- there, loading with stones from the shore.'  At this moment Mr. Warner and Margaret, who had just met in their search for the lost    <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5826-00000068"/> children, came out together within a near viet of the doomed vessel. They stood for a mo- ment, as if'undecided, upon the height above; and then, forgetting every thing else in this fealful etremity, both ran hastily to the beirch, where it spreads out towards the low land. "Thelieareyour fatherandMargaret. Let us go too," said Totum; and, without another word, both hastened breathessly to the scene of peril. "What can e do for the poor men 3 Oh, what can we dr, for them, Mr. Warner 3" cried Raret, almost fainting with anxiety,as they stood helpless together upon the sands within only a few furlongs of the doomed cPLft. "nouse some one who will go out for them in the life-boat," was the prompt answer. "We are powerless, here, child; and it is terrible. E`ind Captain Giles or Tilson, Mar&amp;aret.

The men are s ail away in search of the children." ii No other word was spoken while the three b with white, intent faces, hastened to the lockeo; w boat-house, and lifted out the life boat with res- al olute strength, railing it down to the shore. "Now help mo pnsh her off. I may save T them yet," said Alfred, springing into the boat. "If I had learned to row, my bqv, you should X not go alone,' said Mr. Warner, with one quick, m nervous grasp of the sailor's hand. "Cnn I be ro of any service as it is?" "Z think not, sir.

The old, saucy smile came brtckYa moment to her fkce, and was reflected by his. Then they stood again silent, and almost brcnthess. The clarkneus was rapidly fitheing about thein, for the sun had set long before, "Which is it? one has sunk i" This was sobbed out piteously, hut none an; snered. The boat had sunk utterl-at least   every eye had lost sight of her, and had grown dim with horro. But sho was there again, headed shoreward, and the sands began to he covered now with many people. m the midst of them Htood Mr. I)ennis, with the three lost children, He, too, hai seen the vessel driven towards the fntnl rock, and dashed against it. Then she had dis- appeared; but every thing which was going on for the rescue of the sufferers vas hidden from them by the intervening cliffs; and the sus pense became intolerable, "I most do something!" said the man, in a fever of desperation. His eye ran along the narrow etrand, and calculated the chances. "f you children will all run steadily and fast till you reach the point where the bank juts -out farthestjast yonder, me can climb there to the top.

But the goal was reached, They slow ly toiled up'the friendly sandlcliff, which had crumbled obligingly from the to make way for them, and were safe upon tho bight above. The children, forgetting the peril and the naony which hail clung to them so lately, press ed forwnrd eagerly, thinking oply of the fate of those who might perish any moment, until they stood with the others upon the shore--all hush- ed and waiting, Many eyes turned to them, but hardly, it seemed, even with recognition; and every look went back again through the gathering darkness to fathom the awful mystery of the sea. Fan-    <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5826-00000069"/> nie nestled silently at her father's side, and Midget was lifted up into the arms of her grand- father, who never even stooped to k-iss her or to give her a second look. Edgar stood a mo. ment clasping the hand of Mr. Dennis, and turn- ing firom one to another in search of father or mother, who were not present. Then, with a yearning for welcome from some one, he stole to the side of Captalin 3daybough, wiho laid his palsied hand caressingly on the boy's head with- out turning Iris eyes from the sea..; and the grate- full little mute, lifting both his own hands, press- ed them over that of his friend, and stood there like the others-every faculty of his being look- ing out at his eyes. At last the boats, one after the other, grated   I upon the sands, and brawny a rmswere thrust -out silently and quickly to draw them higher r upon the beach.  The two stone-barge men, who arrived first, stepped lightly and thankfully upon the shore; rbut the poor fellow rescued firom the seat at the t moment of direst peril was wholly insensible. Alfred staggered with exhaustion as he tried to rise, and was lifted out of the boat by old sail- ors who were sobbing like children. But a hand sought his in the darkness, and an arm came about him which was not a sail- or's, and then his strengt6h returned again mag-. : ically. He drew Margaret to his heart with all," the mainly glratitude of at strong soul, satisOid, i with the fullest fruition.   CHAPTER XXYXIII. A LAST PEEP INTO THE OLD DOVE, COTE.   CAPTAiw GILES, in a new suit of handsome broadcloth, was embracing his old wife, dressed in a clean new calico; but with the sleeve,- still rolled back, just as she had worn them while busy at her work. They were standing on their own hearth-stone--both. with smiling faces and dewy eyes; for the captain had just; -returned from Boston after a four days' ab- sence. The Warners bad gone home at the time ap I pointed - but this was less than a month after- wards; and Margarret llad come back to the isl- and that evening,, a bride. She and Alfredl Brand were to keephouse together in the" fur- nishled cottage where she had spent the surn- me r, while their own home was building higtler up on the hills. Captain Giles had just returned firom tile wedding.' There had been much rqoicing and general good-will on the interesting occasion, and every thing had gone off pleasantly, with all the usual satisfactory accompaniments. This was what the captain had just been saying, and the old lady bad almost sobbed with emotion, under the heavy burden of interest which she had felt in the whole matter. Toturn and Frank had been brides-maid and groom; and Frank had looked to the sharlp-eyed old grand- father as though he was wishing it was he who was holding Totum, by the right hand, instead of being separated from her as he was by the absorbing presence of two people wilose bappi. ness so overshaldowed his own. Strange to say,   neither father nor mother seemed to see in all This an y serious cause of alarin. 3  4I tell you what, Miss Giles," said the old ihusbandl, seating himself -in the old arm-chair that he used to rest in nearly sixty years ago, when lie came back from his early voyages; CaCpting; Warner has grown, as bright and silky as a chestnut when it ]Ins dropped out of its prickly burr, after a little touch of the early fi-OSt.91 The old wife rolled down her sleeves, book- ing them carefully at the wristhand, while she smiled delightedly. Then she wiped her eyes and sat down also, listening intently. "The sick casting had been getting strong all summer, in spite of himself; and that last shake-up is likely to make a man of him once more, in my opinion. Island air is a mighty powerful medicine, ain't it? and a shipwreck is as good as an electrical shock for some fol ks." The old eyes of the speaker danced and twinkled with infinite satisfaction, and the eyes of the listener had to be rubbed again and again; and she put her spectacles on and off, and rubbed them also, by way of having something to do. , "To be sure, capting, to be sure, wats her answer, put in at each pause in a low voice, as an encouraging parenthesis. "He seemed just like other folks, 1Miss Giles) 1 continued old Captain Giles; 16and he was as chipper as a spring swallow, even at the thought   of losing Maalgaret; and that is like cuttin g off  his bright hand, I expect, too, when it didn't of-  fend him in the least; and I call that prettyI nigh a nih-acle--don't you V" II I've heard of moral miracles," answered the wife, with a droll smile, reflected from her hus- band's. Miss Warner will miss the girl; but if lie learns to walk alone once more, she can do without Margatret, and get over the ground into the bargain, as easily as if she was lifted up on stilts. It is wonderful how wearing it is to be always drlagging a dead weights like a prisoner chained to a baltZ "Yes, captingi; but don't say any thing about that to any body else, you know. Be sure not to forget yourself sometime." "Of course. I'm only talking now to tile discrceter part of myself. That's safe, I take it2 and Ort11odox." Mrs. Giles answered by a smile thait was as good as a kiss; and -the captain got up and came round to give her a kiss, which was a punctuation-point to the smile. "Who else do you think was at the weddi ng, 1Miss Giles?" Captain Percy, perhaps. Alfred would be sure to want him invited." "(No; be was invited, but he had to take the boy to school, and couldn't make it convenient." "It couldn't be Captain Hezekiah or Mary, because I know they didn't go." CNo, no! I'm persuaded you'll never guess.") (Well, then, you had better tell. me." "Job Dennnis-Ullr. Dennis, they al I call him;; but it was the real job done up handsomely in a new suit, and-his manners bad got a kind of new polish to match." "That is surprising--the most; wonderful of Il Ie bad a bran-new coat and bat that put mine entirely into the shade, and boots shining like a looking-glass;i and, between you and me, I bave good cause to think that the clothes were a present, out and out, from Mr. Warner. That shows gratitude, I take it, for wlhat Job did when he found the children. They treated him as if he had been the first gentleman, and Job came out in a way that was really surprising. I didn't suppose it was in him; but there it was, and it came olut, as the best things will if you give 'em a chance." $6 1 am sure I'm vcery glad. That will com- fort Jedida, and you. must tell her all about it." "Well, what do you think now of the War- ners?"   "I think, capting, that if the best of silver, is left too. long in a damp place it will turn green, and perhaps be likely to get more rust and canker than the commonest pcwter-w re.1 "So do I, Miss Giles. Ahnd I really think that if the silver finally gets scoured up till it's bright again, it will be just as good asi sl  Cj  sgo  snj  '(Just as Igood." The smiling old lady reflected the captain'-; look and tone of hearty satisfaction a little T'ore placidly, it may be, than he would have liked, as she folded her dumplingish old bands from the other side of the stove; but when, she glanced out of the window towards the home of the new neighbors, her face brightened with a genuine mottnerly interest. -She had nursed Alfred when he was a babv 7 and his mother be. fore him had playt6d with hcr children and eat-- en her dough-nats and little tuirn-over pies, into which she had always put a spice of loving niotherliness and good-will. Then she liked Margaret, and from the first she had always re- sented the thought that a sensible, bright girl like her was not entirely the social equal of any one and every one on the island. Now, atlast, poetic justice was budding and blossoming; to a beautiful realization. Moreover, her kind old healrt was still fresh and womanly enough to be very tendelrly stirred by the marriage--of young people in whom she felt an active interest. They bad come to lie her nciighbors for the future, and she liked that. It woke up at resh feeling of benevolence, to think of the aid and comfort which site could offer them, and "it would be the next best thing to having some iof her own children or grand-childlren settled near her. So she wished them happiness as she glanced out of her window to theirs, her whole face allow with the warmth of a bene- diction. b IIt helps to make the ways of Providence seem equal, don't it, Miss Giles?" responded the captain, who had read her heart in her face, as he had been in the habit of reading for more than three-scoreyears. I ' So it does! After living as long as we two have, one ought to have faith ill that." "Ye s, most things come out about even in Ithe lohgC run. I believe I am getting hold of that fact by a kind of second sigh-t," said Cap-, itain Giles, with a little outflasihing laugh which she was half disposed to reprove as not serious -enough, but she thought better pf it and sni'led  also. Then the old lover gallantly quoted 2il- - ton. "The fairest of her daughters, Eve;" 4b    <pb n="140-141 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC5826-00000070"/> and the old dame, shaking her bead at him, turned awary and stroked the cat, which, had been purring for some attention for the last half hour, and had just despaired of getting it. The captain brought his chair around to-the sidle of his wife, and, joining right hands avain,   they fell to talking of the time when she too came home as a bride.
