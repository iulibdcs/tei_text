"Chief master-gunner am I of this town;  'Something I must do to procure me grace."-H-,ENRY V. Mf dear Reader-allow me to introduce to your ' sting' ished consideration, the Rev. Mr. Cary, Yoii will please excuse the gentleman's preoccupa- on anld indifference to introductory etiquette, since he is nol the faintest' intimation that he is the individual trod ced.

He might have been the posses- r of -ithottom's magical spectacles all the days of s lifej without dreaming of the imperfections of his vn heart, or experiencing one longing desire to see      : imseli as others see him!     . But we do not wish to criticize the gentleman in his tnocent ignorance of our proximity. Mr. GCary, as you perceive, is seated in his old arm-   ? 1 ]i    <pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC6440-00000004"/> t    ' THEE EBONY IDOL. chair, in the home parlor of the Parso age. See how cheerily the rock-maple fire roars and gl ws behind the polished brasses! How the fire-light lanees out co- quettishly over the tidy hearth, casting a whole flood of radiance on the occupant of the chair; flying onward to the book-case in the corner; struggling faintly toward the curtains, and suddenly retreating, crls down be- behind the wooden sticks, while small jets, of gaudy-col- ored flame peep cautiously upward, as if playing at bo- peep with some other maple fire! The door opens, and a little girl glides in with a pair of faded slippers, which she quietly deposits upon the hearth, and without speaking, for s e divines her father's mood; lays her dimpled cheek upon his shoul- der, and encircles his neck with her arm. Mechanically the father enfolds her il a caress, but his eyes still pry into the glowing embers and his brow knits for itself another wrinkle. As he sits there, with his shadow thrown upon the white wall by the, warm fire-light, we gaze at him thoughtfully, as at another of those wo drous studies. in God's inexhaustible studio, where, like the child vainly striving to match the fancy-grass in the garden, we weary ourselves in futile efforts to trace in feature or spirit the counterpart of a fellow-morts! The rough outlines, the compressed lip , and muscu- lar frame, are each indicative of decision, and the firm- est of wills. Phrenologically we are war ed, that log-   THE EBONY IDOL.        3 ical combat may be profitably left alone, and to retire with precipitancy whenever that gentleman approaches an argument or a hobby! If there is any one fact es- tablished by Mr. Cary as a mental fixture, it is a con- viction of his personal infallibility of judgment and action. Slow and skeptical in his recognition of modern innovations, his heart softens reluctantly, and his de- cisions close upon his reason with more unrelenting in- carceration, than iroh doors and bolts upon the victim of crime. Ignorant of the vices which dig such fatal pitp for the feet of our young men, Mr. Cary's life had been invulnerable to temptation. Although pinched by poverty, and early thrown upon his own resources, he had nevertheless struggled through a respectable edu- cation, firmly keeping aloof from debt, and while he did not hesitate to earn an honest penny by manual labor, he was too manly-hearted to lean for support upon the Female Charitable Associations, which, for some unaccountable reason, seem indispensable to the interests of modern theology! Mr. Cary's initiation to the duties of the ministry had commenced at the mature period of thirty years, at which time he had been called to assume the pastoral charge of the church in Minden. We say the church, for, though there were other churches in Minden, yet the bulk of the people there were admirably Presbyte- rian; an exemplary body of Christians, who had, many    <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6440-00000005"/> {' 4   T    THE EBONY IDOL. : "of them, been born in the same town, baptized at the same font, played together in childhood, intermarried, and with blended interests and affections, grown stronger and wiser; regarding the Church as the most holy and impregnable. fortress, to which humanity can flee for succor in this world, or safety in that to come. The aged Pastor, who had labored an honest life} away, and been laid to rest where the white marble gleams out its simple inscription of his many virtues, was the only Shepherd the Flock had known, until, having borne him upon their own shoulders to his burial, they had invited Mr. Cary to becom e the re- cipient of his sacred mantle. If they had loved the stranger less, their reverence for ministerial sanctity was unabated; and it is a .ques- tion whether any Romish Pope! ever swayed a more in- fluential sceptre over the minds of his followers. To consult the miniister, was the first- step toward the adoption of all infringements upon old-established cus- toms; and if, shaking his head, he said he was not "clear " that it would be for the " bests" there Was not in all Minden an individual bold or stubborn enough to gainsay his decision. To impugn his motives, or to in- timate a question of his infallibility, would hare been considered little short of a moral outrage. Men and women seldom took the liberty of smiling in his ipres- ence, and as for " on dits." nd " bon mots,' they were unthought of! Little boys regarded him with the   TIIE EBONY IDOL.        5 same terror they did the Doctor, and little girls " bowed low " at his approach, resuming their sports only when the atmosphere was supposed to be well ventilated of his sanctity! This description, .which, in the regions of carnal 6claircissement, may be considered almost a caricature, will yet be recognized by others for its truthfulness. Especially is it still, true of the remote inland towns, and it is to bd regretted by old and young, that this wholesome restraint of even excessive reverence is so rapidly disappearing before the so-called Light and Reason of the present day. Without the church, the community was a quiet, decorous people, with no pretensions to being different {m- or better than its neighbors. And yet to say, "I am from Minden," was a small letter of introduction in its way, since one felt certain that a Minden man was hon- est in'his dealings,-had a little ready cash wherewith to meet his expenditures,-that he drove good horses, -respected his promises, paid for his newspapers,- and was, in short, a paragon of that negative virtue that consists in the absence of smaller vices. Even the deacons bore unblemished reputations; and as for gossip, the capital was so very limited, that the ladies were not unfrequently compelled to discuss new recipes and fashions, for lack of a sister's frailties upon which to descant. And thus, iday after day, the natural and moral sun rose and set upon the pretty village; and had f.,    <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6440-00000006"/> 6        THE EBONY IDOL. a pleasure party from the city happened in upon them of a sunny afternoon, they would have been pardon- able in mistaking  Minden for Rasselas's Happy Valley.               V Such was the church and people to whom Mr. Cary had been called to break the Bread of Life; and being, as we have said, of unprogressive tendency, and having been educated in the obsolete notion that the Clergy were called of God expressly to preach the Gospel, it had never occurred to him that it was his duty to preach any thing else. The "one idea " spent its strength be- fore penetrating the density of the pine forests and granite palisades which encircled the rural Minden, and seemed always crying aloud to the enemy- "Procul, O procul esti profani!" Here, had Mr. Cary located himself in his first love for the ministry, and here, with the talents given him, he had labored patiently, if not zealously, until the period of his introduction to the Reader. He had been absent during the last few weeks, in attendance upon the meeting of, a religious association, which had been invoked by the brethren for the purpose of inquiry into the causes of the dearth of religious interest existing in the churches, as well as for the spiritual welfare of the clergy themselves. From this convention Mr. Cary is just returned with his heart aglow; and it is the enthusiasm of his * I       j "    ,           .   THE EBONY IDOL.  . newly awakened cogitations, that has given the un- wonted abstraction, and fixedness of gaze, which has already been noticed. He had found the assembled clergymen absorbed in the great topic of Abolitionism; eloquent in denun- ciation, and fervent in exhortation, toward such of the brethren as had "slumbered and slept" through the African Crusade. Individual frailties, home sins, and' the complicated wickednesses of New England, pre- sented altogether too sickly a harvest for the sickle of the philanthropist, and the lukewarm were!warned to come up manfully to the greater combat!-to advance in solid column against the diabolical slaveholder. No matter what passions were excited in the human breast! Let men be lashed into demons! Let fraternal blood ebb and flow like the tide! Let the Union be dis- solved! God would smile upon the Fratricide! Hea- ven would sanction the treason of the Traitor'! Let but. the Bond go free! As in morals, it is well known that persons educated in the comparative purity of country life, often yield the most readily to the seductive influences of the city- the very novelty of vice being its attraction; so, intel- lectually, men of sterling talents are attracted from their even orbit by that strange fascination nind wields over mind; and the staid and doubting stickler forfact is not unfrequently the very first to adopt the absurdest ism of the day.       .   .    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6440-00000007"/> 8        THE EBONY IDOL. How often, when some new hobby is rendering the public ridiculous; and a new convert is announced, we hear the expression, i he is the last man I should have thought of;" meaning that his former exhibitions of mind and morals had been antagonistic to any such exhibition of erratic non-reasoning! It was precisely the quiet, monotonous life Mr. Cary had been enjoying in the township of Minden, that made the zeal of his brethren more attractive to him. The subject of Sla- very had never been very seriously considered by him. He knew that slavery had existed previous to, and at the period of our Blessed Saviour's advent, but he had no recollection of the Redeemer's considering that sub- ject paramount to the salvation of souls. Indeed, he had considered it one of the institutions of the Old Testament, which was tolerated as a necessity; and so Mr. Cary had gone on thinking the Bible and "Conti- nental Congress " authorities to be taken for granted. But when he found himself a unit among a throng of positive clergymen, who shamed his rustic garb and bearing by their easy and fluent addreds, the battery of whose opposition he shrank from provoking, it is little wonder that, having no personal prejudices to overcome; he" opened his heart to a comfortable convic- tion of the popular ism! 'As he listened to the 're- hearsal of the wonderful things these clergymen had accomplished, in preaching at the South, and investing funds in the underground railroad; as his mental vision ,  ,   THE EBONY IDOL.        9 opened upon the atrocities committed upon the misera-( ble slaves, who were torn with red-hot pincers, hunted by bloodhounds, and roasted alive for the amusement of overseers; it certainly can excite little surprise, that, being unskilled in political trickery, and accus- tomed to believe in the honesty of mankind, he was soon prepared to endorse the abolition platform with all its absurdities; passing from one metamorphosis to another, until he shone out resplendent as a perfect Abolitionist, with wings proportioned to the absurdest flights. And thus Mr. Cary sits in his arm-chair, and traces out the similitudes of his musings in the curling flames before him. The whole space between Mason's and Dixon's Line and the Mexican Gulf, stretches out before his vision one immense negro mart! each white man an ogre. armed with fagots and cat-o'-nine tails) revel- ling in the tortures he inflicts! As he muses, his own past inactivity looms up before him, lashing him for his stupidity, and culpable igno- rance of his duty to the. shackled slave. The clarion note has been sounded into his deafened ear, and he re- solves that he will shake off this unchristian stupor, gird on his armor, and if needs be, die upon the field of battle f David Copperfield, in his first zeal for a seedy wardrobe, never sighed for a shabby waistcoat as devoutly as' Mr. Cary now aspired to tar and feath- ers!"Riding on a rail" seemed a mode of convey- 1*  e  -      <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6440-00000008"/> 10  ,     THE EBONY IDOL. ance so desirable, and so soothing to his conscience, that he longed to rush into the heart of the South, and hurl his argumentative firebrands into the very face and eyes pf the slaveholders! Oh that his sheltering arm could clasp every bondman in the Universe in one fraternal embrace! Ah, he moaned! had I but wealth to ransom them from their cruel bondage, and bear them back to the peaceful shores of their own Africa! Alexander-like, he sighed that there were no more slave* to: be thus conditionally ransomed! Y As these extensive and magnanimous aspirations aired; themselves in impossibilities, and Mr. Cary's con- victiqfn of his personal inability and poverty settled slowly down upon his throbbing heart, he groaned aloud in his agony of spirit, and cast about him for some humbler sphere which should be operated upon by his modicum of influence  Then uprose before him the quiet valley of Minden-  The little village nestling lovingly within the mountains' bosoms! the modest spire of the solitary churcht the upturned, eager faces of those who, Sabbath after Sabbath, resorted there "Hungry for the Bread of Life."

Antony.-You grow presumptuous.  Ventidus.-I take the privilege of plainlove to speak.-DRYDEN, MR. CARY was still absorbed in his African castles, when Mrs. Cary entered, bearing in either hand a well- polished candlestick, the contents of which carry us back, as if by magic, to days of langsyne. Not the degenerate dripping nuisances retailed in our shops for a York shilling per dozen, but the substantial candle of home manufacture, by the light of which every New England boy has read Robinson Crusoe, Sinbad the Sailor, and Tristram Shandy! Ah, yes! and is not the mnemory still fraught with oleaginous reminiscences of the  dipping-days." We were not simple juveniles then, to be snubbed out of the kitchen by the " help!" How graciously we were permitted to assist in arrang- ing the wicks upon the rods! to run upon all sorts of errands to notable dames and spinsters, for small con- tributions from their hoards of beeswax! and when, by chance, we returned with pockets full of nuts or :"   THE EBONY- IDOL.       13 apples, it is our humble opinion we were as much elated, and near the perfection of bliss, as mortality in small- clothes can well' be!         r Then came the melting, and the delicate process of forming the dip. How carefully, in our restless admira- tion, we avoided too close proximity to the arm of the presiding genius, for who of us but knew no mercy was extended to the jostler unskilled in the art of dodging!  As the candles grew into importance, and assumed "A local habitation, and a name," with what intense delight we prostrated ourselves in Oriental fashion, to take a perspective, prospective, and retrospective view of their increasing charms! At rarb intervals, when the dipper was forced to leave her treas- ures, and we were allowed to assume her responsibility, with what trembling eagerness we held the rod, and watched the swaying liquid, as we slowly raised the immersed candles and rejoiced in their growing perfec- tion! It was an occasion when the moral of the i' En- vious Frog " was to be regarded, and when we particu- larly felt the force of that appeal which invokes a humble heart in all seasons of prosperity! But to return to Mrs. Cary, whom we have most ungallantly left standing with the candlesticks in her fair hands!    - The smile, of gratification at her husband's return    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6440-00000010"/> [14       THE EBONY IDOL. which lights up her plain features, renders her face agreeable, and we feel attracted toward her by the gentle and dignified tout-enseimble of her person and bearing; but Mr Cary, still insensibly to the love-light of those dark hazel eyes, only arouses from his reverie when she addresses him. ' Have you nothing to tell me of imy old home friends, Mr. Cary? 'Did they send me no greetings? Neither have you told me of the meetings.

"Dead?" he! reiterated, abstractedly, "no one is dead-so far as I am informed, your friends are in health;" and instinctively his fingers wove themselves into Indian wigwams, and his eyes returned to their peering into the flickering flames. A second low groan escaped him. Mrs. Cary regarded him nervously. "Are you ill, Mr. Cary?" she asked, with a shade of anxiety in her voice; " pray, what do you groan so for?" "Groan!" ejaculated the minister, now fully arous- ed; "why shouldn't I groan! Why should I forget in my own personal comforts, the miseries of millions who are this moment held in cruel bondage, with no eye to pity, and no human arm to save! Who has made us to differ? Why am not I, and you, and Nary   THE EBONY IDOL.       15 here, writhing beneath the lashes of a fiendish task- master!  "Mr. Cary," asked his wife, gravely, placing her hand upon his shoulder, "are you crazed?" "Crazed!" echoed our friend, springing up and -pacing the little room with monster strides; "Mrs. Cary, you are very obtuse! But it is the fate of man, perhaps his cross, that in his loftiest ambitions he stands isolated from companionship where he ought soonest to find it! In the great work before me I had hoped to be encouraged by your sympathy, and strengthcned by your prayers!" We will not jot down (for our readers to skci) the long and not very interesting harangue in which Mr. ary indulged himself. 'The amiable Mrs. Cary, en- tirely unaccustomed to enthusiastic scenes, and never during her life before, having heard her husband mani- fest the least zeal for martyrdom, listened in amazement to his violent expressions, and when they softened, drawing her knitting from her pocket, very quietly de- voted herself to counting off the stitches for the heel of her worstedshose. But did this placidity upon the part of his better-half gratify the gentleman? Indeed it did not! What man in excitement is ever satisfied with composure? Cutting a long stride short, our rev- erend gentleman wheeled right-about-face, and assuming the stately. attitude of arms in the rear, blurted out: Madam, why do you knit? Is it wise, do you    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6440-00000011"/> 16        THE EBONY IDOL. think, when the world is groaning with oppression, and your own sex are torn from country, and friends, and their own offspring, to pander to the power and lust of their self-appointed masters, for you to sit there in that easy chair, before this cheerful fire, and knit!" "Well;" said Mrs. Cary, who had now, as we might say, 'scented the game,' ' perhaps it is tot!" And settling the stitches carefully in the middle of the needle, and winding the worsted systematically around the tips, she returned the same to her capacious pocket. "My dear," she asked, returning his impatient gaze, " what do you think I had better do?" "Fight and pray," cried the excited gentleman. "Be up and doing! labor! we can all do something! You remember the widow's mite, Mrs. Cary?" "Yes," rejoined the lady, sadly, " we can pray, and we always have prayed; but as for fighting, it seems to me to be a good deal like Don Quixote and his windmill. We c&amp;n make ourselves generally uncomfortable, I sup- pose-can neglect our proper vocations for such as will be serviceable to no one; but how, I should-Jike to be informed, can that help the condition of the slave?

Women," he muttered contemptuously, " never should try to argue ; however good you may be at heart, you are terribly deficient in logic. Knit, Madam, but don't argue! You remember the advice of St. Paul in 'regard to your own sex .?  "St. Paul was a bachelor, and possibly had been disappointed, as most bachelors have," cied the lady, with a malicious fling at Mr. Cary's owri heart experi- ence. "It has occurred to me more than once, that if women made themselves as superbly ridiculous with their isms and jack-o'-lanterns, as you men do, we should at least deserve to be called the 'weaker vessel!'" Mr. Cary, fairly gasping with indignation, con- fronted his slightly sneering help-mate! "Madam, you speak lightly of God's anointed! you blaspheme!" and, we are very sorry to say, Mr. Cary shook his clenched fist in such close juxtapo- sition with his wife's face, that she involuntarily shrank from it, but recovering herself, said pleasantly, "A man who possesses such tenderness for the slave, should have more regard for his wife's nerves; if we cannot talk without excitement, we had better not pursue the subject;" and Mrs. Cary, raising from the table one of the inimitable tallow candles whose praises we have sung, disappeared through a side door, reappearing presently with a dish of apples so red and tempting, that they naturally suggested great lenity in one's con-    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6440-00000012"/> 18    .

Wheel- ing her husband's easy chair nearer the table, Mrs. Cary selected the finest of the f-uit, and giving a finishing polish with a snowy napkin, proceeded to pare, and place the same in charming proximity to the gentle- man's seat; then was added a glass of iew cider, the remembrance of which, even at this rdi0te period, causes the historian to pause with emotion! S, Happy the woman who can thus beat the domestic sword into a pruning-hook, and thrice-favored the man, whose wife can thus " stoop to conquer!" The little palatable temptation thus gracefully ex- tended as a peace-offering,- was as frankly accepted by the pastor. When the " one idea," rafter performing an elliptical evolution ar6und the conj ual dessert, resumed its ascendancy, what with apples and cider, fire-light, easy chair, and loving wife, the whole subject seemed so exceedingly modified, that conversation soon glided into a smoother channel, and the woes of white and black were for a brief time forgotten! But when, at length, Mr. Cary wiped his lips complacently with the snowy linen, he took his wife's hand within his own, and said: "My dear, for many years I have labored in the midst of my little flock, anc. so far as an enlightened conscience can pass judgment upon one's olvn actions, I have endeavored faithfully to discharge my duties in the fear of my Heavenly Father. It is very strange   THE EBONY IDOL.       19 that during all this time I have regarded Slavery with indifference. Indeet, the question of its divine sanction 'had never occurred to me. But this sinful lethargy has been fully broken, and I must now atone for the past, and labor while the day lasts." Mrs. Gary Pressed his rough hand caressingly be- tween both of hers. She respected his sincerity, and had always relied iiplicitly upon his judgment. "You know," she said, thoughtfully, " that a year last summer, I spent four weeks in the very place where this convention was held. From my earliest remem- brance they have had three good churches there, all of them occupied upon the Sabbath by large congrega- tions. The kind feeling existing between these different denominations was delightful, and it was impossible to say which was the most zealous and exemplary. But you know as well as I can tell you, what this abolition movement has done for that unfortunate township. The ministers talked, prayed, and preached abolitionism, until politics and religion became one and inseparable. And what i as been therresult? 'By their fruits ye shall know them 1' Isaw what were the fruits, and so did the people,-and the ministers who called this asso- ciation together to pray over the low state of Zion, and devise ways and means for the re-establishment of their churches! The pteople who preferred Scripture to poli- tics on Sundays, refused to attend church. Even Dea- con Gleason, who was in truth an abolitionist in the    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6440-00000013"/> 20        THE EBONY IDOL. fullest sense, deserted Mr. Slade's church. 'Why, dea- con,' I said, 'I hear you are stopping at home Sabbath days, because your minister prays for the slave! ' Humph!' said he, 'I don't mind his praying for the slave-I do that myself, and so does every Christian, I hope, but I do mind his overlooking the interests and souls of his own\flock, for the bodies of negroes!' N' Not bodies, deacon-you are too severe,' I said. "'I say bodies, and I mean bodies! ' returned the I deacon. 'Do you suppose,' he continued,.' that a cler- gyman expects to convert negroes by abusing their, masters, and exciting the North to unkindness and out- rage? I find no such precedent in my Bible, Mrs. Cary. Mr. Slade availed himself of the privileges of his desk, not only to preach abolition doctrines, but even attacked the motives of public men, whose char- acters are as unsullied as his own, declaring them to be unfit for office and confidence. Even his pastoral visits were converted into political wrangles, and instead of canvassing the town for souls, he exerted his influence for the polls. Finally, on the eve of election, he preached a very bitter political sermon, when half the congregation left in the midst of the discourse. Some feW returned when the excitement had abated-more went to worship at the other churches, and others, who were too strongly orthodox to secede, preferred to re- main at home. This state of things extended gradually to the remaining churches, until, s you know, for the i.      ,1   T'IE EBONY IDOL.      21 last year not a church door has been opened upon the Sab- bath day. The charitable societies are broken up, and Sabbath loungers are visible everywhere;, and I am told, more ardent spirits have been consumed than for any ten years previous.' Now, Mr. Cary,who is re- sponsible for this state of things? Who made these churches a nuisance? Who withheld the Bread of Life from these famishing souls, and when they asked for bread, gave them a stone?-and drove them out into the fallow ground to feed upon husks, and return to their wallowing in the mire?-to desecrate the Sabbath, and acquire habits which are certain, ultimately, to plunge both themselves and their innocent families into disgrace? It is easy for a clergyman, when his own will and passipns have withheld dew and nourishment from his vineyard, to pronounce its barrenness accursed of God, and to weep over the blighted vintage as being the 'mysterious dispensation of Providence.' But I believe, Mr. Cary, from my heart of hearts, that when the recording angel traces out the pious sacrilege, he will add, weeping tears of blood, 'Woe unto that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! it had been better for that man if he had not been born!"' "'Mrs. Cary," said her husband, with the longest and deepest of groans," ' Judge not, that ye be not judged,' and remember,' with what measure ye mete, it shall 'be measured to you again.'

Would it;' ot be wise firs:, 'to east out the beam out of thine own eye: and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye "' "Remember, my dear," said the wife, warmly, "it is Christ; himself, who says, ' Ye shall know them by their fruits.' 'Every gocd tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.' Now tell me honestly, Mr. Cary, as a Christian who dares to speak his conviction, even when truth clashes with prejudice-has the fruit of these clerical efforts been good or evil?" "My dear," said Mr. Dary, laying his hand upon the family Bible, "it is the hour for our devotions!" \.             . PT IS   CIAPTER    III. "The ruling passion-be it what it will- The ruling passion conquers reason still."-POPE. ALL over hill and dale lay the spotless robe winter so lovingly throws over the landscape dismantled by his blasts. Cosily nestled the little clumps of evergreens down into its soft folds, while the naked- branches of the elms and maples, and the straight, lithe birch, were bending beneath the snow wreaths fallen during the night. , Above the aristocratic dwelling and low thatched cottage, the light flakes had alike piled themselves, lodging in every nook and cran- ny, sifting down into the sooty chimney, creeping in at the window sills, and cuddling in huge heaps at the very door and gateways of cot and church. Look yonder at the mountains-those "Battlements    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6440-00000015"/> 24 iTtE'L 1EBON Y IDOL. of God!"--not stern and frowning arid awful in the density of their impenetrable forests as when we gaze upon them in summer; but smooth, and soft, and white as the wool-fleece-the tops glowing and deepening into gorgeous hues of purple and crimson, as the Day-God greets them with burning kisses, and rushes onward in his chariot of flame! And see how the pale blue smoke steals up from the love-altars scattered here and there, just where the mountains slope down to tLe plains below! Man is not yet abroad to awake you from the dreamy delight of your ejaculatory orisons, ard involuntarily you shout out joyously, and send your voices ringing through the keen, metallic atmosphere, in some simple paean of adoration, learned far back in childhood, per- chance in the Sabbath school of just such a church as that whose quaint spire glitters, on the -lain below. "God made the country, bit man made the town 1" But the inhabitants of Minden are astir. The snow of the previous night is tossed lightly aside; the smoke curls cheerfully up from' the churrci-roof, and cordially at length the sweet-toned bell peals out its weekly invitation, "Do come-do comre-do come "- and the snow-capped mountains upon 11 sides take up and prolong the echo, "come-come,!" And so the village church is filled. The evening in which we left Mr. C&amp;ry at his family devotions, closed without any renewal of the subject   TIME EBONY IDOL.       25. under discussion, and for reasons which will readily suggest themselves, Mr. Cary chose to confine his cogitations to his own breast. The night was far ad- vanced when Mr. Cary sought his chamber, but Mrs. Cary, wisely pretending to have long since been sunken in the drowsy deep of slumber, allowed her husband's unwonted irregularity to pass without comment, trust- ing to time and common sense to set her " gude mon " right. Words therefore cannot portray the amazement of that excellent lady, when upon this identical succeed- ing Sabbath, Mr. Cary launched forth into a discourse well calculated to scatter fire-brands upon the right hand and upon the left! He confessed his long and culpable neglect of duty, and he exhorted his little flock to immediate and earnest investigation of their own personal responsibilities. Feeling the subject grow upon him as he continued, Mr. Cary gradually enlarged upon his first intention, and warmed into denunciation, until with the blindest of infatuations he lost sight of the boundary line that separates mental independence from folly, and mingled religion with politics until he con- cocted a kind of moral salad, intolerable as nourish- ment, and unpalatable as a relish! Once astride his theme, became his hobby, and he needed neither whip nor spur to carry him beyond the limits of. discretion. He urged his. people to remember that the ballot-box was at their disposal-that the vote was the highest prerogative of free men, and he did not 2    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6440-00000016"/> 26        ' THE EBONY IDOL. hesitate to declare that the man who could countenance slavery even by inaction, was an' euny to his God and country; and that he who would, directly or indirectly, sustain another in the traffic of human flesh, was un- worthy of trust or conldence, and should therefore be ineligible to office. It was just here, when Mr. Cary, with both arms extended, was raising himself upon tiptoe, preparatory to rendering his sentence emphatic by making an &amp;c. of his person, that a heavy step upon the floor, accom- panied by the clumpsof a wooden crutch, announced to the excited audience that Squire Bryan, the rich, and, of course, influential great man of Minden, was leaving the church. It must be remembered that in our country villages freshly-barbered young men do not promenade the aisles that pretty girls may be induced to look at them; neither do young misses go out "because they are tired; "-fainting is not fashionable; and the phy- sicians, for some sharp reason of their own, do not re- sort to the stratagem of being called out; so that when church-going is attempted, good order and pious de- meanor prevail, and whether the pecple hear or sleep, they hear or sleep to the end. IConsequently, Squire Bryan's withdrawal excited immediate attention. From looking at the minister, the people commenced looking at each other; and several gentlemen, who were accus- tomed to consider the Squire as a"burning and shining * .                  .   TR'E EBONY IDOL.  light to all that place," sat unusually erect, assuming a very dignified and injured appearance. Even Mr. Cary flagged for a sentence or two, and with an " ahem" of embarrassment, descended from his rhetorical flight with ungraceful precipitancy. When at last the benediction was announced, and the male portion' of the congregation waited in the vestibule for their better- halves, the whisperings and impressive iods and shakes /  of the head exchanged between them, did not escape the jealous eye of Mrs. Cary, as she pressed her way out. Mr. Cary, himself, who always paused in passing to speak with such of his parishioners as he seldom saw during the week-days, could not be insensible to a kind of restraint in these greetings, entirely foreign to their  former unaffected cordiality. There is, perhaps, no medium which conveys so readily the good will of a man's heart, as his mode of shaking hands. To a person whose sensitive nature is affected by such trifles, no courtesy of expression or demeanor can atone for the cold, stony hand grasp. The warm heart sends its magnetism to the palm, and strangers who have once shaken hands in the most pro- found silence and .darkness, possess each a key to the other's inner nature, often disregarded, but rarely lead- ing them astray. Fearfully does this theory manifest itself in declining friendships Itow often in sorrow, and incipient disgrace, has the breaking heart been yet  .s          / i    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6440-00000017"/> 28       TrUE EBONY IDOL. more keenly hurt, not by the averted eye or curling lip, half so readily as by the faint pressure and unprof- fered embrace of those whom it had loved. For the first time during the long period of his min- istry, Mr. Cary passed out of the church with a chill in his being. Mrs. Cary, whose frank, impulsive nature knew no hypocrisy, presided over the family lunch with a" don't-do-that-again " air; and little Mary, gazing from one to the other of her parents, secretly wondered at the unusual taciturnity of the Suncay dinner. No ailusfon was made to the morning's discourse; and Mr. Cary, retiring to his study, remained invisible until the -bll again summoned him to his labors. It would be inferred that our indignant friend Bryan was missing from the afternoon service. Not so ; being a- man of decided and independent action himself, he believed every other man should be judged with lenity. If Mr. Cary might suppose he had a right to tamper with the ballot box, and nmake stump speeches in the desk, so had he, Horace Bryan, an equal right to vacate the premises, and leave the reverend gentleman to say his say. But the Squire is not a man to " nurse his wrath;" so there he sits with his keen, bright eyes, which y6u feel to be scales of justice, fixed upon the desk, saying as expressively as eyes could say, C' N3W, Mr. Cary, if you have any Gospel on hand, I am at your disposal." But when, after the introductory exercises, Mi. Cary \ o-.   THE EBONY ItOL.       29 arose, reannounced his morning's text, and with a kind of dogged demeanor, announced his intention of 'pursuing the subject of his morning's reflections," Squire Bryan, taking his hat, adjusted his crutches, and clumped slowly down the aisle, slamming the door very emphatically after his retreating person. Neither did matters rest here. Mr. McLean, upon whose farm the Squire held a mortgage, and Mr. Smith, the Postmaster, who had been indebted to Squire Bryan for his appointment, both felt called upon to follow his example. A srmall stampede was the result; each succeeding slam not 'a whit inferior to the first, each destructive in its effect upon the speaker'srintro- duction. Quiet being restored, Mr. Cary proceeded to preach, not "Christ and him crucified," but himself; spreading before his audience his reasons for the positions he had assumed, regretting that offence should be given, but declaring it to be his conviction of duty to preach what he understood to be the requirements of the Gospel, as- serting the liberty of speech, and protesting himself willing to fight to the death for freedom and truth. Al- together, he complimented himself a good deal, and rounded his periods with a proper regard to humility and self-distrust. The sermon 'ended, Mr. .Cary read the closing hymn, but the choir remaining silent, it was discovered that the leader had withdrawn. Now, as evils seldom come alone, it so happened    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6440-00000018"/> 30       TIE EBONY IDOL. there was a poor widow, whose only chlld, a son, upon whom she had leaned as her staff through this earthly pilgrimage, had been smitten with paralysis, and lin- gered upon the verge of the grave. This widow and this son, turning with natural confidence and affection to -the bosom of the church for comfort in their great calamity, had this day presented an humble petition that the pastor and church would pray God, if so be the cup of suffering might pass from tLem; feeling as- sured, as the petition touchingly added, "that when two or three should agree together as toulching one thing in Christ's name, it should be granted Lnto them." Strange as it may seem, Mr. Cary, in his closing prayer, had well-nigh forgotten the poor widow and her son! He had prayed for the President of the United States, for the Senate, and " all men in high places;" he had prayed for sunshine and rain, for seedtime and harvest, for the slave and his master, and all that " were in bonds everywhere." Indeed, he had prayed for every- body and every thing, excepting the two sufferers who. had so meekly requested his remembrance! A low sob stole out from a remote corner, smiting upon his ear, and recalling him to duty. But the words were briefly and almost coldly spoken, as such words are only tob apt to be, and there was no listener present but felt that in Mr. Cary's estimation, the widow and son were of small moment, compared with his sable brethren! And so the people said, as they slowly walked home   'THE EBONY IDOL.       31 together, and they did not forget it when they got home, either. One old lady, who had more than once been grieved by these omissions, even said to a visitor on the following Thursday morning, " that for her part she could always tell when ministers had parishioners in trouble; for they began either at the Creation or Deluge, and prayed down to that afternoon, when, as if it had just occurred to them, they threw in (in a kind of pa- renthesis) their petition for some poor dying creeter, for whom they ought to wrestle day and night, and let the President and Senate, take keer of themselves a little." Portrait of that Old Lady.    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6440-00000019"/> postAoffice, he met Mr. Hobbs. Let it not be supposed that the pastor had suddenly fallen from grace in the mind of all Mind6n. He had his friends, and among them, but by no means the best example, was Mr. Hobbs, the husband of a distin- guished member of Minden tea-partydom, whom -he commonly alluded to by a grammatical lapsus that vir- tually implied his own non-entity as "Miss Hobbs."  Hobbs was a man, of ordinary standing in'the Vil- lage community. Though a person cf coarser natureI than most men about him, and utterly uncultivated, he yet " held his own," whatever that was, by virtue of certain qualities mostly [ppreciated among simple- minded prosperous people; he was sober, industrious, and unflinchingly practical in all thi gs. It was his pride not to be "notional," h and " to lie up to what he thought," in extenuation of which it niust be said that his frens an amn thm u yn* astebs   THE EBONY IDOL.       33 his thoughts were never exacting nor of particularly high flight. It was also a point of pride with him to attend meeting " with a precise punctuality that gave it the appearance of a business engagement, and to fol- low in the moral footsteps of his beloved pastor. Shaking Mr. Cary very cordially by the hand, his admiirer congratulated him upon his sermons the Sab- bath previous. "Them is my opinions exactly," he said, "Niggers is our brethren! We have all one Father, and if He does not make any distinction, it is a pretty time of day, says I to Miss Hobbs, for us white folks to set ourselves up, jest because we ain't black! I and Miss Hobbs thinks with you, that all men is created free and equal!  "Thank you, Mr. Hobbs, I am glad to hear you say that! it is pleasant to hear an encouraging word, after the averted faces I have seen of late. I fear I have given great offence, and I hear that Squire Bryan is very indignant, and was so unjust as to suppose I re- ferred to certain individuals in the house." Mr. Hobbs hesitated. There sprang a new scruple in his head, "Which first he scratched, and then he said-" Well, I must say, that was exactly what I and Miss Hobbs thought! Says I to Miss,-Ilobbs, says I, if Mr. Cary didn't speak right ott in meeting and fit a     <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6440-00000020"/> J34:      THE EBONY IDOL. tight jacket on to Squire Bryan, I am no judge of what's what! And Miss -Iobbs, says lhe" to me, says she, them's my opinion!  Owing to some reason that has been mysteriously kept secret, Mr. Cary did not pause to corte6t the im- pression that Hobbs had received; but eaci, after sone further trivialities, went upcn his way. This was but one of many greetings t iat the worthy pastor received-upon that morning, and this owes the distinction of being recorded here solely to the fact that it is fairly representative of all the others. Contrary to the anticipations of many men in Minden the world continued to go on pretty much as usual, and the next Sunday was eagerly expected. It brought a lengthy and excellent discourse upon charity. As Squire Bryan, on that day, hopped along home- ward with his crutch under one arm, and his little wife annie upon the other, he was overtaken by the clergy- man.  "It was a charming sermon you gave us this morn- ing, sir," he said at once, "and I am fearful it was needed by us all. For my part I am a stupid alms- giver. Nannie, here, does a thousand little charities every day so gracefully that, I wonder everybody else has not thought of them before-it is one of her graces. Now this sermon of yours has actually made me charitably inclined, the sensa-ion penetrates my wallet even, and I am quite in a furor to do something'; " and   THE EBONY IDOL.       35 the Squire stopping and extracting a bill from a well- worn pocket book, extended it toward his pastor. "There, sir, if you could manage to slip that into the hands of that poor widow who was up for prayers last Sabbath, it would really be doing me a favor; I am told, by the way, that the town will be obliged to assist her soon, unless individuals come to her relief. For one, Mr. Cary, I would be willing to do any thing reasonable, and beg you will make use of my purse in whatever manner suggests itself as desirable. We ought not to see one of our neighbors, and especially a Christian woman like Mrs. Wellman, resorting to public charity." "I thought," said Mr. Cary, "you left church before her petition was read." "So I did, sir, but I was told (a pinch from Madam) that her petition was very indifferently noticed. It has always surprised me, sinner as I am, that people should still keep up that old custom. It is very beauti- ful in sentiment, I grant you, but like many other things, worldly and sacred, the spirit is dead. Clergy- men mention these requests in their devotions with such indifference in tone and manner, that I must say, Mr. Cary, I long to warm up their blood with the application of a raw hide. I remember one clergy- man, who prayed for those in 'affliction to my liking. He did not pray for every thing else first, as if they were all of more importance than the poor stricken    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6440-00000021"/> 36      , THE EBONY IDOL. heart that had cast itself, bleeding, before the altar, but he began, and ended, and filled up his petition with that individual supplication; his prayer was brief, per- haps, but it was entire and earnest, and you felt that if supplication could bring down a blessing, the mourner would be comforted!" "Whatever foibles you may possess, Mr. Bryan, the want of frankness is not among thlm," said Mr. Gary dryly. "You must remember, Squire, it is easier to criticize the errors of other people, than to do the same thing well ourselves." "Very true, Mr. Cary. Very true indeed, sir. I am a frank spoken man, and express myself warmly. I do not wish to be rude, sir, but I must say, I cannot conceive how a clergyman can stand in the presence of his God, cold, impassive,:with ut even a tear in his voice, much less in his eye, bearing in his extended palm the burden of some broken heart, that has, suffered and struggled, and concealed urtil even silence becomes insufferable, and it seeks relief upon the common bosom of humanity; crying aloud to the good and merciful to wrestle with God in their behalf!" "You possess a very warm imagination," said Mr. Cary, regarding the Squire with a complaisant smile. Squire Bryant's crutch came to a sudden stand-still, and he confronted the clergyman with a look of mingled astonishment and contempt. "A warm imagination!' le repeated.   Thank   THE EBONY IDOL.       37 God, I have at least that redeeming virtue to be sneered at! and that in thesedays of cant and hypo- crisy I have a heart to be aroused by something. Dur- ing the long years of your ministry in Minden, Mr. Cary, this poor widow has been familiar to you, and I, sir, have known her from infancy; and a brighter eye, a ruddier cheek, or more blithesome spirit never graced childhood than she possessed when she sat in the old school-house under the hill! Never shone warmer home light or home love upon locks so sunny then, but now so whitened by the frosts of her heart! She was the pet and darling of all ;' the first love even of many; the queen of little revelries; and when, a beautiful bride, she came forth from our rustic church, the blessings of old and young, the rich and the poor, followed the foot- steps of $tisie Wellman. But God has pressed to her innocent lips the bitterest of life's cups; and she has drank it to its dregs. Never has she swerved from the path of duty or rectitude, though often and again her weary feet have been pierced by the thorns. Her rela- tives, all of them, lie there, in our church-yard. It was your own lips that spoke solace to her heart the day she became a widow, and it was your hand, sir, that sprinkled the baptismal water upon the brow of her dying child, and pointed her to the 'Lamb of God, who taketh away the' sins of the world.' From afflu- ence and ease, from the blessed surroundings of love and plenty, she has borne her cross of heart crucifixion    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6440-00000022"/> 38        THE EBONY IDOL. down the stairway of adversity, like our Saviour, cheer- fully when she could, unmurmuringly when she must. Who of us ever listened to her repinings? And who of us have not seen her, in our own hours of sorrow, hovering like an angel of mercy around our homes, forgetting lher own afflictions in those of her fellow creatures?" A faint sob fell upon the minister's ears. "Xannie is thinking of our own little lambs, who fell asleep upon the widow's breast," said the Squire with a husky voice, while his hand closed 'sympathetically upon the fingers of his weeping wife. "If I tmistake not, Mr. Cary, you have similar reminiscences to recall in your own sad experience! Oh, how like mockery were words of consolation then! And yet, think of it, what were -their sufferings, compared with those of that poor paralyzed boy, blasted at noon-day, cr ours to those of that broken-hearted mother, watching, in helpless despair, the gradual decay of her idol Think of the sweet time when she held him to breast, a laughing boy, dreaming such blissful dreams as only mothers can dream, when she should rejoice in his usefulness and exult in his manliness. When death and adversity ov'erwhelmed her, and she seemed abandoned by God and man, you cannot have forgotten, Mr. Cary, how she clung to this one frail boy, laboring day and, night for his comfort, respectability, and education! And now, after all her hopes, all her heart struggles, there *    ,   k   c J   ,   TII IE EBONY IDOL..     39 he lies, the last flower in her life's waste, blasted! the last drop of water her parched lips sighed for, dashed  to the ground! The long night of poverty and age settling down upon her, moonless, starless! While memory, wreathed with roses and cypress, sitting side by side with the gaunt figure of want, tells-over and over the luxuries of her youth, never so coveted as now, when her dying boy moans for them in his restless anguish! "Why, sir, she told my wife, that night after night, ere her want was so known, she had watched by his bedside, witlout even the light from a penny candle, because she was afraid she should tax the kindness of her friends! Talk of imagination! Is it possible for one heart to compass the world of suffering this weak woman'has borne silently, and alone! A warm imagi- nation! Mine, oMr. Cary, shrinks back fearfully from attempting to penetrate the holiest of holies of such a temple! and may God have mercy upon those who can rend the veil only to sneer at the burning records, written all over the charred altar of the human heart!" The Squire was silent, and the three walked on, the crisped snow crackling beneath their feet, " but not so cold," mused he, "as the sympathy of the selfish world, not so difficult to melt as the human ice in the bosom of our brother man!"     <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6440-00000023"/> CHAPTER V. "The primal duties shine aloft, like stars; The charities that soothe and heal and bless, Are scattered at the feet of man like flowers." THE EXcuirSION. "I give thee sixpence I I will see thee damned first." THE NEEDY KNIFE-GRINDER. SHORTLY after the scene of last chapter occurred, Squire Bryan's gentle little lady went upon an excur- sion through a number of the village homes, upon which it may be profitable for us to go with her, as it will at least introduce us to some families in which we are not yet acquainted. "Mrs. Hobbs," said Nannie, as she sat in the sitting room of Hobbs' house," I am going around with a sub- scription for Widow Wellman, who you know is in great affliction, and I thought you would be glad to give something, so I called here the first after Mrs. Cary's. You know a paper circulates more successfully with the influential names first!"  '  It will be inferred that Nannie was a little diplo- matist in her way!   THE EBONY IDOL.       41 Mrs. Hobbs made no reply; she looked straight at her husband, and upon that hint, Nannie looked in the same direction. Mr. Hobbs, conscious of the "posi- tion," hemmed-put in a fresh quid of tobacco-crossed his legs-uncrossed them-tipped his chair back against the wall, and himself in it, crossed his limbs again, bringing his cow-skin boot exactly in a line with Nan- nie's face; and after all of this manual labor, what do you guess he did? "Took out his wallet?" you smilingly suggest. Wrong, though. Mr. Hobbs, after settling himself, did nothing more or less than look at Nannie! and Mrs. Bryan looked at Mr. Hobbs. Mr. Hobbs continued to ruminate and shift his pedal extremities for several min- utes. Finally, depositing his quid in his left cheek, he inquired, l "Why can't Mrs. Wellman work, as my wife does?" and he glanced admiringly toward the " bone of his bone." "Them's my opinions!" ejaculated Mrs. Hobbs! "That's what I and Miss Hobbs thinks,' said the gentleman, removing his tobacco to the other side of his cheek, and evidently preparing for a set speech, which- Nannie cut short by rising. "Very well," said that small lady, "I did not call to argue you into giving. I supposed you would con- sider it a privilege to give in this case. The question of expecting a feeble woman like Mrs. Wellman to earn    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6440-00000024"/> 42        THE EBONY IDOL. money, fettered, as everybody knows her to be, day and night, to the bedside of her paralyzed son, is too absurd for discussion. I only hope,- Mr. Hobbs, if you are ever destined to leave your wife a penniless widow, she will never have that question askedl in regard to her! You know Mrs. Wellman Ls well as I do, and her deserts and needs. If your heart does not plead for her, no words of mine could prevail." "I suppose folks will talk, if Miss Hobbs don't give sunthin'," said Mr. Hobbs, fidgeting in his chair; and with reluctance but too. apparent, he handed Nannie what she supposed to be a quarter, but what proved to be a pistareen. There was one other member of the Hobbs family -one known through Minden only as " little Mary"- a girl so fragile, so pure-hearted, so ethereal in person and spirit, that she might have sprung from the bosom of sleeping flowers, wooed by the passionate starlight. A sweet, pale face she had, so delicate and lovely, that the gazer looked again, and again with tenderness and sorrow upon those deep introspective eyes, that seemed to be forever pleading.   "Little Mary" accompanied Mrs. Bryan to the door, and when in the passage-way, sh slipped four three-cent pieces into the lady's hand. "Mrs. Bryan,"j she :said, 'it/i4 such a trifle I am ashamed to give it, but it is all I h ve in the world. Do not put it upon the paperi nor say a word about it to 'E /    IIE EBONY IDOL.  i     43 anybody. It will be a ninepence more to the poor widow, and for that reason I have courage to give it." "The little dear! cried Mrs. Bryan enthusias- tically, as she referred to the subject on a futuye occa- sion ; she is an angel! I cannot conceive how such a iearl came to be cast,before such swine! It was all she had! but was that ahy reason why I should deprive her of the satisfaction of feeling that she had done something-all she could-for the widow 2 will not her young heart grow warmer, and her dreams be sweeter every night, for thinking of the little treasure she has, laid up for herself in Heaven? and I could not grieve her by refusing it; btrt I resolved upon the instant, to give her a dozen times that amount before many days." Nannie shook' the dust of that house from her feet, and called upon Mrs. Kimball, a frank, energetic, prac- tical woman. "I am glad 'to see you going round," she said im- mediately; "I was tempted to start out myself, but Sara was seized with croup last week, and has been ail ing ever since. What missionary wives manage to do in their fields of labor, is more than I can divine.

Nannie was there. The house of the village doctor was the next scene of action. Dr. Baker was just home from visiting the widow's son, and was drawing off her account--Mrs. Wellman had asked for her bill. ianalie thought that "seemed very foolish in her." "I don't think so," said Dr. 3Baker; "I told her months ago I could do nothing more for her son than to render him more comfortable. If it was my own son, I should certainly consult the best medical advice in my power. It will give her satisfaction even if the effort is a failure, as I fear it must be." 5When the object of I the visit was announced, he re- ceipted his bill; and passed it over. "There," said he, " give her that for me, and the Lord do even so to her, in her hour of need," laying his hand lovingly upon his wife's head. Mrs. Baker turned toward Ler husband a tearful, grateful look; it really savorec of the honeymoon! Nannie thanked.,him very cordially in iMrs. 7Wellman's berhalf.'I "I have rather to thank -you, he said, " for I was    TIIE EBONY IDOL.       45 designing to give it to her myself, and have avoided a scene which I always dread." So the little lady arose to go, when the doctor said to his wife, "Are you not designing to give something too, Mrs. Baker?" "I thought you had been generous enough for us both," she said, smiling. "But I do not," said the doctor; " it is as much of a satisfaction to you to give, as it is to me. I prefer that my wife should indulge in the luxury of charity for herself, for it is a luxury," he added, with unction! Mrs. Baker took out her purse, and handed Nannie five dollars, saying proudly, as she did so, with perhaps the weakness of a wife, "Mr. Baker isn't like most men, Mrs. Bryan,"--Mrs. Bryan silently assented-  " who insist upon doing all the alms-giving because it looks well. If there is but ten cents to go into the con- tribution box, he insists upon my putting in five, be- cause, as he says, although he can give for me, he cannot feel the blessing of giving for me! And that is the truth, Mrs. Bryan, and I wish all men thought of it.", The postmaster came' next. He gave five dollars for his wife, and the young clerk, Stebbins, gave two dollars for his wife. Why," said Nannie, " you are not married?" "Not exactly," he said, laughing and coloring, " but I have read that all-little boys have little wives some-    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6440-00000026"/> "      I THE HEBONY IDOL. where in the world, that they ought to think politely of; -and though not so little, I think the idea is a good one. I insist upon subscribing for Mrs. Stebbins." "A nice young man, that Stebbins," thought Nan- ! ie, as she, turned her steps toward Mr. Smith's; "his little ideal, wherever she may be, has a noble heart in store for her!            ' Then she went to Mr. Smith's!"Mercy!" said Nannie, as she entered, seeing in Smith's hands Holmes' Poems-" haven't you finished that bdok yet? You have been reading it these five years to my remembrance!" "I am only reviewing the Oysterian," said Smith; "I always had a particular affection for that chap, who was taken with the cramp and drowned. Now, you see, if he had been as light-headed and hearted as I am, he would have floated high and dry, cramp or no cramp!"  When Smith became quiet, Nannie told him her er- rand, and that set him off again; and he enlarged somewhat censoriously, perhaps, upon Mr. Cary's and other clergymen's manner of praying for the poor. Kannie, however, finally fastened him. "Vell," he said, 'I have no objection to Mrs. Smith's giving, but she is a little green-eyed-though not a monster-and especially jealous of widows. Now, you see, I am a little skew-eyed, and as both eyes look different ways, my wife always thinks I am looking after dimity, look which way I will; so to ease the dear * I -    THE EBIONY IDOL.      47 creature's mind, I have adopted this way of looking and walking-how do you like it, Mrs. Bryan?" and plunging both hands into his pockets, and pointing that little snub nose of his to the zenith, as straight as such a crooked little thing could be pointed at any thing, he marched off whistling, and was out of sight before Nannie discovered that his simulation of himself was only a ruse to get away. Mrs. Smith looked after him laughingly. "Do you think Mr. Smith ugly looking?" she asked naively, turning to Nannie. "I humbly beg your pardon, Mrs. Smith," said Nannie, " but I certainly must plead guilty." "Well," said Mrs. Smith, looking at Nannie pleas- antly, " some folks do, but he always looked handsome to me;" and Mrs. Smith gave five dollars for the sub- scription. Mr. Johnson came next. Mr. Johnson was at home, of course-he always is! He was gorgeous in a royal purple dressing-gown, and crimson slippers. When Nannie named to Mrs. Johnson the purpose with which she called, Mr. Johnson said:  "Mrs. Bryan, it affords me the most unbounded satisfaction, to have the felicity of bestowing my mite upon Mistress Wellman. I have known of her for many years. I have always considered, Mrs. Bryan, that we, upon whom Providence has lavished its great bounty and preference, should not appropriate the glory to our-    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6440-00000027"/> 48        'THE EBONY IDOL. selves, but should continually ask ourselves who it is ,that has made us to differ! We of ten talents should not despise the humble individual who has but one!  "It is not from the gentlemen," said Nannie, who had a horror of speeches, "that we solicit aid. The ladies flattered themselves they were to be alone in this good deed. But some of the gentlemen have insisted on giving, and I shall be happy in adding your name, if you are so disposed, Mr. Johlson." "It is quite the same thing," said Johnson, loftily; , "these contributions of the ladies are simple extractions. from the funds of their husbands. For one, Mrs. Bryan, I always prefer to control my own resources, and very fortunately, I am blessed with an inestimable lady, who has no false notions in regard to woman's rights!" "Not rights, colonel," said Mrs. Bryan, " but privi- leges. It is a very pleasant thing to be free agents in our charities, at least." The colonel gave another flourish with his hand. "My lady, the inestimable Mrs. Johnson, has too deli- cate perceptions of her own proper sphere, to wish to assert her independence in any way whatever! Allow me, Madam, to enlarge your charitable funds with the enclosed donation ;" and he extended the silver he had been daintily wrapping up in pink tissue paper. Nannie took the pink tissue, and rushed for the pure air! The said paper contained twenty-five cents. "There's nought so mean but may do wondroup service!" I s   ^   ' '   THE EBONY IDOL.       49 From Mr. Noyes was received an order on his own store, of ten dollars, to be taken in groceries; and from Mr. Rusk a similar one for two cords of wood. Miss Dickey was next in course. Nannie did not expect much there, but she liked at least" to hear their excuses." "Now, Miss Dickey," she said, "I have the finest chance in the world for you to cast your bread upon the water, and to realize that truthful and beautiful as- sertion, 'it is more blessed to give than to receive.'" "I declare," said Miss Dickey, dropping the smile with which she had received our friend, and donning the most woe-begone expression of countenance imag- inable; " objects of charity are multiplying to such an alarming extent, that it is quite impossible to attend to so many. I have given away every rag of old clothes on the premises, and as for cold victuals, living, as Da- vid and I do, alone by ourselves, it cannot be expected I should have much to dispose of." "Certainly not," said Nannie, "but fortunately I do not come for either; a little money would be more desirable every way, and if I hear correctly, the gentle- men have the impression you have plenty of that." Miss Dickey began to smile again, and Nannie pro- ceeded to urge Mrs. Wellman's claims upon her benev- olence.

"  They might as well take ler as any other!  ( "Very true," said Nannie, " but Mrs. Wellman cannot wait for shirts to be made and disposed of, or for socks to be knit. The truth is, she is in want now, and must be assisted immediately, or call upon the town!" "Well, I do think tha' would be the wisest thing she could do," said Miss Dickey; " every town has an asylum for sick, and it seeis to me much more suitable for them to avail themselves of it, than to tax-private charity." "Miss Dickey," asked the inexorable Nannie, "would you be willing to have Mrs. Wellman, who has been a kind neighbor and fiiend to us, all these long years, beside being a mem er of our own church, com- pelled to take that poor, helpless boy to the farm house, where the vicious and insane are all huddled together, and where neither could have the repose eor food so ne- cessary for them Even friends would shrink from visiting them there!

Nannie was becoming excited, which Miss Dickey saw; and left the room; when she returned, she pre- sented fifty cents, with a countenance and manner so ungracious, that the offering was rejected. "No, indeed," said Nannie; "Mrs. Wellman shall be insulted by no such flinty charity! it is the cheerful giver that is beloved of God! Live long as you may, Miss Dickey, you can never repay the debt you owe her, though I beg your pardon for reminding you of it." Miss Dickey's eyes flashed fire, and Nannie left her with "A sweet disorder in the dress.

"Sinking, I fear," said the widow, struggling to speak calmly; "he misses his cordials-his wine is all gone," she said, sighing.  "Dr. Baker tells me you have decided to change your physician?" ' Yes ;, not with much hope of success, but from that restless desire we all have to keep doing. My poor, poor boy!" and the widow buried her fa6e in her hands, and sobbed as if her heart would break. The sifferer, aroused from his partial slumber by the sobs of his mother, extended his hand feebly toward her. "It is all right, mother-it is all right!" he mur- mured; and after a pause, as if speaking to himself, he whispered, " whom he loveth he chasteneth!" "He is so patient," said his mother, in a subdued, broken voice, " always so consirate of my inability to furnish him with what he needs, that it seems all the harder to have him denied."

"May God forgive me," she said; " never till this day have I known despair.". "Was it right so to distrust your friends? ' asked Mrs. Bryan, reproachfully. "Why did not you come to us?" "And so I would; but last night, when wood and candles were both gone, and I asked Edward if he could stop a little by himself, he looked so earnestly in my face, and said, ' Mother, don't beg-not even for me!' 'But I cannot see your face,' I cried. ' No matter,' he said, 'with the holy starlight, and your warm heart beating near me, it cannot be dark or cold!' And so, with my arms around him, and his face pressed to mine, as we used to slumber in his infancy, he prayed and slept." The arm of lannie embraced her. "'Look up, poor, stricken heart, and behold the signs of promise; for the rainbow is spanning even this darkest of clouds.'" It was the tone of exultation, rather than the words of Mrs. Bryan, that met the ear of the sufferer. For the first time, Edward became conscious of her pres- ence. He smiled his welcome, and motioned to her to take his hand. His eye fell upon the familiar carpet- bag. "What have you brought me to-night '" he asked,  <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6440-00000031"/> 56      THE EBONY IDOL. feebly, but with a look of childish delight, for he knew his visitor never came empty-handed.  Who that has ever brought to the fainting invalid a luxury, but has recalled that gleam of gratitude, long years after the speaking eye has beeIi sealed in death? How gratefully he smiled his recognition of favorite delicacies-the box of fresh figs-the lemons-and little jars of home-made jellies-and lastly, the generous wine, and the loaf of bread, which, under Nannie's skilful fingers, always became so wondrously white and dainty. The tearful, but smiling eyes of Edward, sought the face of his mother, as with a low, tremulous voice, he repeated those exquisite lines of Cowper- "Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, But trust him for his grace;  Behind a frowning Providence, He hides a smiling face "  "Sinner that I am," cried the penitent widow, rais- ing her clasped hands and streaming eyes to heaven, "Iay not this greaf'in to my charge!

Sinner that I was and am! His mercy smites me like a rod!" It was then that Nannie, with her kind heart all aglow, revealed to)these afflicted sufferers the messages of which she was bearer. "I met Mr. Rusk this after- noon, and he wished me to hand you this order, as an earnest that he would send you two cords of wood at any time you might desire." Mrs. Wellman took the paper, and burst into a flood of tears. "And Mr. Noyes, who has never forgotten your kindness to his children, when they were so sick last .simmer, sent his order, also, for some groceries, which he hoped might not come amiss, now that Edward was sick himself. Ten dollars! And, Mrs. Wellman, you have always been so kind and sympathetic towards us all when we have been in affliction, and Edward, too, was always doing little favors for the whole neighbor- hood, that we felt as if we must be allowed to make you some useful present, now that you are in the same kind of trouble yourself. We hardly knew what you wanted most, so we made up a little purse, thinking you could use the money to better advantage for your- self than we could for you. Do not feel the least deli- cacy in appropriating it, for we shall always remain in your debt, even were it a hundred times more than it is.

With the cry of one exhausted with excitement, and hysterical wNith sudden joy, the widow threw herself upon her knees, upon the very spot where she had so  recently moaned ouLt her despair, and with quivering  lips, poured forth a petition of such utter abandonment,  that Nannie flung herself by her side, and sobbed aloud in her full-souled sympathy.

"EAVING Mrs. Wellman and her son to enjoy all the surprise and gratitude, and earnest thanksgiving ex- cited by Mrs. Bryan's Christian visit, we turn our steps again toward the little white cottage of the parsonage. The firelight gleams out invitingly through the muslin curtains, and as we catch glimpses of the group within, we loiter at the window to muse over and enjoy the domestic tableau. Mr. Cary is sitting in. his arm- chair, with an open manuscript in his hand, from which he has apparently been reading. Mrs. Cary, for any appearances to the contrary, may have been occupying her sewing-chair since the first evening we made; her acquaintance.

Lucy's head, true to-the instincts of nature, seeks the mother's lap, while the soft, silken curls steal out from beneath the caressing hand of the  mother, and glimmer upon the dark cloth, like ripples  of water kissed by the silvery moonlight. The eyes of the clergyman werea taking in this charming home scene; but true to the one idea that had so completely absorbed the man, had transformed the sleeping innocent into a poor, benighted slave-girl, kneeling for mercy at the feet of her cruel mistress. Mrs. Gary, on the contrary, having lisened attentively to her husband's discourse for the ensuing Sabbath,j was seriously revolving in her mind the probable re- suits attendant upon its delivery, and enjoying, as far as her hopeful nature would allow, th "dark delight" of anticipated evil. "Mr. Gary," she said at length, espectfully, and half timidly," I can see no possible good resulting from such a sermon as that. Of late, you liave spoken most fully upon the subject of slavery, and you know very  well how those sermons have been r ceived.

Where is the necessity of irri- tating our people with arguments which most of them understand as well as you do?2' Had a bomb exploded in the auricular chambers of the reverend gentleman's caput, it is uncertain whether then his dignity could have been more effectually rout- ed, than when Mrs. Cary, his own wife, presumed to question the justice and perfection of Mr. Cary's deci- sions! His thick, heavy eyebrows curled themselves into such an elevated arch of astonishment--his eyes darted forth such midnight blackness-and his whole figure dilated with such indignation, that we greatly doubt Mrs. Cary's ability to have resumed the thread of her discourse, had not her own gaze, either evasively or absorbedly; been fixed iupon the superior polish of those brass andirons! Such, being the case, in innocent un- consciousness of the sublimity of the elements opposite her, she went on: "For ten years our little church has been increasing in numbers, and gathering strength from the character and wealth of its members. We have had none of those dissensions too often found in churches-we have had no cases of dismissal-and the people of Minden have invariably manifested the kindest and most affec- tionate disposition toward us. During the last year the state of religion has been unusually interesting; our evening meetings have been fully attended, and our seasons for private conversations more frequented than    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6440-00000034"/> 62        THE EBONY IDOL. ever before since we came here. Several of our young people have seemed quite seriously minded, and some of them almost persuaded to be Christians! "Now, Mr. Cary, allow me to ask, if in this state of things, it is desirable to bring forward abolitionism, which has proved so fatal everywhere to the welfare of the churches? knowing as we do that attention will be averted from the great cause of Christ's kingdom-un- kind feelings be engendered-inquirers will drop off- church members secede, and before two years I venture to predict you will stand a sad spectator of the spoils your own hands have wrought in God's vineyard!" "Mrs. Cary," exclaimed the now exasperated cler- gyman, "do you suppose a minister of the Gospel should, for a moment, be influenced in his own percep- tions of duty by the effect that will be produced?" "But a minister is as liable to be misled by his pas- sions and. prejudices as the rest of mankind! Can it be the duty of a clergyman to repeat what experience everywhere proves to have resulted in evil?" "I tell you," shouted Mr. Cary, "the people are asleep in this great cause of equality and freedom. They have forgotten, or closed their eyes to the solemn fact that millions of our brethren, as good by nature as we are, and far better by practice, are at this hour ex- tending their manacled hands toward the North, and uttering the Macedoniancry,' Come over and help us!'

You can sacrifice your peo- ple here, to be sure-a people for whom some minister must labor! If you forsake them, who will gather up the scattered flock? So long as the unconverted and the inquiring meet you at every step, how can you feel it duty not only to waste Sabbath after Sabbath in preach- ing upon subjects foreign to the great theme of salva- tion, but by diverting their attention, and irritating their personal prejudices, drive them from church, and harden their hearts with bitterness and rancor? You will destroy your own usefulness, and ultimately the vital piety of your people!" "You reason like a woman," returned Mr. Cary, with what was intended to be a tone of dignified re- buke, but which to our unsophisticated ears resembled rather the accent of dogged sullenness. "We clergy- men profess the great principle of equality and freedom to be included in the plan of salvation, and to be a part of the Gospel we are called to proclaim. All national sins are local sins, inasmuch as the sins of individuals make up the sins of the masses: to put down sin wherever and in whatsoever guise it exists is our mis-   THE EBONY IDOL.       65 sion.

"It is by agitating the subject of slavery at the North, that the South will be brought to reflect upon the heinousness of their traffic-' A little leaven leav- eneth the whole lump.' It is not to be expected the South will throw away their slave property of their own free will. The drowning man clings not unfre- quently to his gold, until the weight of it seals his doom! It is human nature to prefer wealth to princi- ple; and the South will cling to slavery so long as it is for the interests of their purses. The reform, therefore, must commence at the North, among those who have no interest in the manual labor of the slave-who can analyze its good and evil deliberately, and like a good physician probe the wound freely, that in time it be healed." "Mr. Cary, you forget that this subject so newly agitated by you, is an old, well-tested experiment abroad.  The wound has been probed, and the physicians are abundant everywhere, who stand, probe in hand, itching to lay the cruel hurt open to the very bone.

Why, f 'our plhi- lanthropists so thirst for le suppression of evil, do they  not bestir themselves in tie thousand and one reforms  demanded in the N'orth, and which affect our present and eternal welfare quite as much as this question of  Southern sin! It seems o me, that instead of inflam-e matory speeches delivered behind people's backs-in-- stead of stealing and secreting their property, to prove that they hate no right to it-instead of sending hot- headed, ha  ducated, ad dled-brained Yankees to stir up strife, and instruct the blackls how to murder their  masters and raise insurrection, they would do better to cast out the devils that seem to have taken such entire possession of themselves. It has always been admitted, even by Northern men, that we are the severest of task- masters, and soonest yield to the seductions of slavery, when Southernized. I have no doubt some of our    .

Now I will defy you to name a single act in which that woman is a free agent; and yet Mr. Brown is one of our owi church members, and what is called an honest, intelligent citizen; but he keeps his tyranni- cal heel upon that woman, as if she were a scorpion!

As for money, she told me not a month since, that if every odd cent she had possessed since her marriage, was added, she had never been the possessor of two dollars; and that often she had been obliged to resort to all kinds of subterfuges to conceal  the pecuniary manners of her husband, when she had been solicited to contribute to charitable objects. She is never allowed to sell her butter or cheese or eggs, or any of the farm produce that replenishes the purse of the farmer's wife; and yet, sick or well, she must stand at her post in the kitchen, the dairy-as the mother of eight children, and the mistress of his house-and last, but not least, the eternal drudge of Mr. Brown him- self, who, however blind he might have been before mar- riage to her imperfections, is a conjugal Argus, which your favorite St. Paul might safely call a thorn in the flesh.' And now, what is her reward for this connubial servitude 'She is graciously permitted to eat her stinted, and homely fare from Mr. Brown's deal table; to shelter her head beneath his crazy old farm roof; and' to be called Mrs. Brown! and it is my humble opinion that this very upright and model husband wqild curtail even these advantages if he had the ability!"

It is possible Mrs. Brown's is an extreme case, but I think not an uncommon one. Men of inde- pendence and even affluence, do not hesitate to exercise this ungenerous and oppressive vigilance, and many an active, high-spirited girl degenerates into a hackneyed, hum-drum housekeeper, who, with suitable encourage- ments for indulging her laudable ambition, would have made her home a paradise, and her husband a wiser and happier man." "A  little tainted with 'woman's rights,' sneered the clergyman!

So withtheproceeds of domestic economy he purchased he; -a handsome marble, and upon it wrote his own eulogy! He went into becoming mourning-became bland and youthful, and a few months after married a buxom, showy lass, who made butter and cheese, pudding and pies, and is lauded by her husband as a model woman. "I do not know," said Mrs. Cary, musingly, "which  is the most to be dreaded, domestic or national bond- age; both are bad enough, certainly. Let us not over-  look the evils of the one in our misguided zeal for the  other!

The look of surprised $exation with which this dis- covery was made, yielded to a comic smile of good hu- mor, as placing the manuscript upon the table, Mrs. Cary resumed her knitting, gazing with half-shut eyes upon the dying embers, and yielding the reins, to fancy, plunged into the shadowy realms of the past and future. I    CHAPTER VIII.  Teaching that all opinion is but vanity.-MENANDEn. THE Sabbath following the somniferous argument of our good dame of the parsonage, found Mr. Cary armed and equipped according to the- requirements of the abolition law, gnashing his teeth at the slave- holder, hinting at swords and pistols, hurling thunder- bolts at the stars and stripes, and even shaking his own two corporeal fists in the very face and eyes of our Union! Squire Bryan deluded, by the late charitable dis- course into the belief that Mr. Cary, having said his say, was returning to his good old church-going ways, and being in a quizzical complaisaht mood, laid his  lame foot upon the cushion, and making himself gene- rally comfortable; proceeded to listen with the most devout and undivided attention. Now, as Squire Bryan. was the "Washington Potts" of Minden village, the mere fact that he chose to listen was sufficient of itself to secure the attention of a large portion of the audience.    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6440-00000039"/> 72       rTHE EBdNY IDOL. We do not propose giving even the outline of Mr. Cary's discourse. Such sermons have rung from our pulpits, until every sensible man and woman too, has turned away heart-sick from the house of God. The congregation dispersed silently, and more than one in- dividual as he passed through the church-door, regis- tered a vow never to enter its portals again, so long as the pastor chose to prostitute his sacred desk to the dis- semination of such practical falsehood. "We have political meetings enough," said young Stebbins, "without paying our ministers to preach politics. Ii went to church with a real desire to hear and get good, but see, how vexed I am! One had better stay at home than feel so," and young Stebbins never entered the church again. As for Squire Bryan, he went home, lighted his Havana, assumed that ele- vated position men find so congenial to pedal comfort, and closing his eyes communed with his own heart and was still. The next day, however, the Squire was at his office window, and, as Mr. Cary made his daily call at the Post, the window was raised, and the Squire's sonorous voice was heard inviting the reverend gentleman to enter. "Mr. Cary," he said, "it is time for you and I to understand each other. I have always regarded you as an honest and upright man, have respected your good sound common sense, and relied upon you both  I   THE EBONY IDOL.       73 as my temporal and spiritual guide. As for the' last, God knows, I Ihave great need of one. Business men, like myself, plunged all the week in turmoil and strife, and looking only upon the darkest phases of humanity, regard the Sabbath with an affection that persons with common cares can never experience. You know, sir, that I have always been a regular and atten- tive listener, though I make no professions as a Chris- tian; still, I remember a few halcyon days, far back in my boyhood, when a few of us thought we 'indulged hope,' and held our little prayer-meetings in the pine woods around the old school-house. It was a delusion, no doubt, but I very often, even at this late day, find myself singing over our hymns with something of the old feeling.' Here the Squire paused, drummed mus- ingly upon the table with his finger tips, and whistled softly, a part of the sweet old tune "The Bower of Prayer."  "But I beg your pardon, Mr. Cary," he said, arous- ing himself from dream-land, with a quick motion of the head. "As I was saying, the Sabbath is dear to me as a  season of repose, both mental and spiritual, if it can be allowed to such as me to speak of spirituality, and I cannot see you converting its sacred hours into political capital without real pain and regret." "Squire Bryan," said Mr. Cary, "I am sensible you have taken offence at my discourses upon the subject of slavery, nor are you the only person of my congre- 4    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6440-00000040"/> 74       .THE E ONY IDOL.  gation; yet, as your. influence is more extensive than many others, it is perhaps more to be regretted."  "Mr. Cary, I presume our views upon the real  nature and influence of slavery are exceedingly similar. I But this I do know, that no clergyman is called of God  to make stump speeches in his desk; and I, for one,  enter my protest against such sermons as you have chosen to present for our consideration these few Sab- baths past. And if you persist in forcing upon us such sentiments as these, I tell you, once for all, you will be  responsible for more evil and more sin, than you can ever atone for, if you live to the age of Methusaleh " How  can truth be productive of sin?" asked . Mr. Cary.  "Truth in its purity kindly and considerately pre-p sented, will always be, if not attractive, at least palat- able. There are many things beside abolitionism that may have truth for its basis, that are equally unsuited to Sabbath day discussion," returned the Squire. "I always supposed a clergyman had a right to preach as his conscience didtated," said Mr. Cary. ' "I beg your pardon, Mr. Cary. If your conscience  dictated to you to give us a lecture upon Taste or  i Music, you have no right to avail yourself of the Sab-  bath day for that purpose! 'Will ye rob God?'

The subject of Temperance is certainly more closely connected withl our moral reform, and Intemperance brings with it vastly. greater evils than slavery ever can, and yet, you would not feel it duty, nor would you justify yourself in presenting that subject to us during the Sabbath day. It is not three months since you declined addressing us upon Temperance during Sabbath evening, although everywhere else, so far as I am informed, such meetings are approved. Now, sir, the facts are these:-The clergy have made slavery a perfect hobby. With a few honorable exceptions they have joined forces, pledg- ing to sustain each other. They presume upon the sacredness of their profession, and the confidence and prejudices of the people, to take such liberties with the church as they please. At first, the good old puritanic blood was triumphant! Who dared, question the clergy? If a voice from the crowd uttered its indigna- tion, the Plymouth rock groaned to its centre, and cries of sacrilege and blasphemy resounded upon all sides! But the clergy have carried this thing too far.-Their own imprudence has rent the veil asunder, and the people are reasoning for themselves! They weary of this eternal harping upon the nigger-string! There is no discretion discernible in the blind infatuation with which at-.all times and all seasons this one idea is shaken in our faces! Now, I tell you what it is, Mr. Cary, you may preach these discourses to your heart's    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6440-00000041"/> S6        THE EBONY IDOL.- content but as for me or my house sitting under the droppings of any such degenerated sanctuary, you will see me damned first!" "Squire Bryan," said Mr. Cary, gathering himself up with slow dignity, " you forget yourself!"' The Squire smiled bitterly. "Perhaps," he said, "that does savor of profanity, and yet, it very much resembles one of your own cxpressions in your last Sabbath's discourse! Did I not understand you ;o say, Mr. Cary," continued the Squire, " that if you ever flinched from this great work of emancipation, you prayed God to smite you in his just displeasure, and banish you from His pure presence, forever? I think those were your very words. Where is the difference save in our method of expressing .ourselves? I am simnply the most honest. Without mincing the matter, there is a vast deal of polite profanity issuing from our pulpits, which falls very jarringly upon the ears of the world! It is high time for the Pulpit to be purged from some of its abominations, or I venture to, predict an' era of religious death more fatal to America, than the darkest days of infidelity to France." Mr. Cary was silent., "You say, Mr. Cary, that you have a right to preach upon slavery and all other topics, which appear to you to be in the path of duty! Now, sir, I wish to suggest this with proper respect and delicacy. You are a hired servant of the people, hired and paid to per-   THE EBONY IDOL.        " form a given duty, viz., to preach the Gospel of Chest; to visit and comfort our sick; and promote, to the utmost of your ability, our spiritual interests! You understand what we consider to be the Gospel, as taught by Christ. You know, that it is to preach this Gospel as we understand that word, that you are hired and paid, and that it is the kind of religion our humanity requires at your hands. Now, by what right do you pocket our money and deprive us of the thing bargained for? If I hire a man to cut hay for me, and his incli- nation induces him to cut wood instead, would he be con-' sidered a faithful servant? Would you consider it any excuse for him to say he felt it his duty to cut wood? ;No, sir, you would say emphatically, I know my own wants best, I engaged you to mnake hay, and it is hay you must cut. How many of our clergy, Mr. Cary, who are so zealous for the reform of our great national sins, would feel it their duty to sacrifice their churches in this manner, if their salaries were not promptly paid them? Sir, I have no" faith in this great hue and cry of duty! I have no respect for the man who opposes X^ his will to the common sense of the people. We know what our religious wants are better than you can tell us, but ve grope blindly for the pearl of great price, and the wail of sinful despair is going up everywhere, 'What shall we do to be saved?' Instead of going forth like good shepherds, and searching for the lost sheep which have fallen into the pit, and laying them .     <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6440-00000042"/> 78        THE EBONY IDOL. in your bosoms; and bringing them tenderly into the sheep-fold, what do ,you do? You carry dissension and rebellion among the little flocks grazing so peace- fully in the green pastures and beside the still waters! You render their food bitter and unpalatable, until they break from' their enclosures, and' wander up and down in strange places, seeking for the food that satis- fies the natural cravings of their souls! They hear the voices of strange shepherds and they learn to be called by their names, and to follow after them, and when at length the sheep-cot is deserted, you fold your hands complacently, taunt the broken flock with the wondrous depravity of their natures, and wash the blood of their destruction from your skirts!" Still Mr. Cary was silent, his involuntary motions alone indicating his susceptibility, "Occasionally," resumed the Squire after a pause, ' I have fancied you alluded to myself in your remnarks. Especially when speaking of the election of certain men to public office. Men, whose positions, in regard to the reforms of the day, were not fully defined and understood! The people generally, understood such to. be your reference, and I wish to ask you directly, whether that inference was correct!" "I cannot be held accountable for all people infer, Squire Bryan.

I desire you to answer yes or no!" Mr. Cary gave his chair a little hitch toward the table, and twirled his pencil with some embarrassment, but said with apparent candor: "Squire Bryan, why should you suppose I referred to yourself particularly? Is not the world full of i-  1 political men, exerting all their influence in direct oppo-   sition to the great interests of our national prosperity? Men, destitute of principle, figuring simply for their own success and individual pronotion?"  Mr. Cary, I ask you again, did you, or did you not think of me personally in connection with your remarks? Will you please answer me without equivo- cation or mental reservation?" Mr. Cary was silent. "Yes, or no!" thundered the Squire. "Squire Bryan," said Mr. Cary, blandly, "I should be sorry to havenany unpleasant feelings or unkind words pass between us. Allow me to wish you a good after- noon," and Mr. Cary taking his hat, moved toward the door. "Mr. Cary," said the Squire passionately, placing himself before the door, and facing that gentleman, with a right-about movement, "I am a plain spoken man, and I despise evasion wherever it is found!

Whoever sets himself up as my spiritual guide, shall at least be man enough in courge to meet his assertions face to face with the man he attacks, and the gentleman who is my friend, shall know how to answer yes or no, without trusting to his cloth to protect him from being called to an honest account for both deeds, and words !" Squire Bryan opened the door to, its widest extent, inviting the gentleman by a motion of his hand, to avail himself of free passage; but Mr. Cary hesitated upon the threshold, and holding his hat in one hand extended the other amicably toward the indignant Squire. "No, sir," cried the Squire, drawing himself up, with dignity, "the foe who honestly opposes me in the broad glare of day, I have always respected; but the hand that seeks to wound me covertly, and the lips that betray with a kiss, are more to, be loathed than the slimy trail of the serpent !"

THE political excitement, which for months had been gathering strength and intensity all over the country, as the party candidates for the presidency had elucidat- ed their platforms, and eaten tbcii' "hasty plates of soup " with a secretary at their elbows, approached our remote village of Minden with great tardiness. The inhabitants who wanted but " little here below," had vegetated with quiet stolidity; the knowedge of luxuries even being confined to a few individuals whomp business called to the cities, or such as were inoculated by summer visits from fashionable cousins, who are es- pecially prone to remember their poor relations during the dog-days! So the good people quaffed their mugs of old cider, on great occasions indulged in a glass of currant wine-smoked their old-fashioned clay pipes- kept aloof from stimulants-and were, or fancied they were, as well to do in the world as their neighbors.     <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6440-00000044"/> 82      - THE EBONY IDOL.

Champagnes were inadequate to " keep the spirits up," and occasionally brandy was used as a substitute. Politics grew stale; whist and billiards were a relief, and small stakes added to the excitement. The hours for dispersion grew later and later, until they extended into the " wee-sma'-hours," when young men  led each other home "baying at the moon; " and married rmen with families, to whom they should have been " a great ensample," forgetful of the moral contained in the inimitable Tam-o'-Shanter,   THE EBONY IDOL.       85 returned misty-eyed in the gray morn, only to grow sober, and alive to, their revel's head-ache, to the music of a conjugal Caudle!

Husbands and wives who had tottered " together" up hill and down-who had " my-dear'd" each other in public, and sat hand in hand, that the artist might perpetuate their love with their beauty, now stalked at antipodes, and bolted their food with the sullenness of f boa-constrictors! Corpulent and feeble men, who, when within doors, found it impossible to stoop for a pair of slippers, trudged through mud and sleet in, torch-light proces- sions, until chilblains and rheumatism "gave them Jesse," and not even the intimation of the Leaders that it was time to " hooray," could keep alive their amor patri without frequent libations of water (and brandy)! No wonder, then, that with Satan laboring so zeal- ously for the world's people, and Mr. Cary so undevot- edly for the church, that between the two, the morals and religion of our pet village should have rapidly de- clined.

Professors grew lukewarm and negligent, and by and by, Mr. Cary preached to children and women, his deacons, and such of his male hearers as coincided with his opinions, or whose apathy rendered them indifferent to his isms. Mrs. Cary mourned sometimes to her spouse, but oftener to herself, as she saw her own gloomy prophe- cies so rapidly fulfilled; while her husband, wedded to his unyielding stubbornness of purpose, knew no re- l enting, nor would he, had he seen that whole church mangled and bleeding at his feet. He, the reverend Mr. Cary, was infallible, as the truth whose exponent he professed to have become! It was surprising with what rapidity the parishion- ers became conversant with Mr. Cary's whole history. Although his reputation had remained so spotless during his sojourn in Minden, it was now suddenly revealed that even the best of men h ave their foibles, and that Mr. Cary was " no better th n he should be." We doubt whether adversity contains a finer or more impressive chapter, than the one we read so tearfully and with burning cheeks, every word of which burns into our hearts like molten iron, revealing to us that when the dark hours of our life lower around us, and we sway in the tempest like broken reeds, clutching at the hands that. have caressed us to break our fall, those very fingers wrench away the frantic grasp, and hurl 9\              r    TLTHE EBONY IDOL.        87 us with greater precipitancy into the vortex of our de- spair!

Like all such precocious phenomena, she had been old at fifteen, young at thirty-five; in which autumnal splendor we present her to our readers. After the marriage of her  brothers and elder sisters, and the death of her parents, which last event had left her an orphan at the tender age of twenty-five, and an annuity which made her quite the heiress of Minden, she had retired from public instruction, confining her efforts to " classes" and select schools, whither the young ladies resorted, 1" with two -towels and a spoon!"

Of late years Miss Dickey had grown weary of bright eyes and blushing cheeks, and had lavished her affections upon the animal kingdom, which certainly was more susceptible to her attractions. Indeed, her domicile was a kind of stationary menagerie, where  goats, dogs, cats, rabbits, parrots, birds and domestic fowls congregated, each rejoicing in the most euphonious of cognomens; and if Miss Dickey's eulogiums were to be considered orthodox, the most remarkable of their species! The goat from his valor had been christened the Duke of Wellington; the greyhound was known as "Lord Mortimer ;" the cat was called Euphemia; the rabbits were, affecting remembrancers of Cowpers pet " hares ;' while the canaries were a host of " ar- tistes," of whose names we frankly confess ourselves ignorant. Although an "orphan," as Miss Dickey always tearfully called herself, it will be seen that she was by no means the lorn woman she might have been! Living as she did in the "bosom of her interesting family," and devoting herself intently to its interests, Miss Dickey's humanity might have completely ossified, but for the one little channel that chance had kept open to her.    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6440-00000049"/> 92        THE EBONY IDOL. An elder sister having married unfortunately, and died of a broken heart, had left her only possession, a son, as a memento to her friends. So long as the grand- parents had lived, the family had united in annihilating the amiabilities of the motherless David. He had been scolded and caressed alternately during the entire period of his childhood, while his little gastric tube had been converted into a miniature railway for the conveyance of little barley dogs and cats, which were incessantly availing themselves of that conveyance. Possibly, it was his greediness of appetite that gave to the boy's eyes that projecting, half-frightened appearance, which David wears to this day; at all events he is free to confess that the prominence of his ears is entirely arti- ficial, having been cultivated by listening to his aunt's secrets, and standing at the doorways ears up. As David's peculiar genius developed itself, he grew to be a perfect gad-fly upon his aunt's comfort; but loving him as she did, equally at least with her animal kingdom, and considering him. as her own personal property, the son of her orphanage, she held him to her heart as unflinchingly as did the Spartan lad the animal that devoured him. As David advanced in years, he made himself serviceable upon the homestead, ruled his aunt with his whimsical good humor, relieved her of all superfluities in the form of sweetmeats, cordials, and spending money, turned her richest sentimentalities to ridicule, assisted 'her imagination by personating   THE EBONY IDOL.       93 ghosts and headless men, and finally exhausted his small, literary acquirements in sending her amorous valen- tines and mysterious love-letters. Of Miss Dickey's personal charms we are silent. Old Father Time, who is never satisfied toying with young cheeks' and raven locks, always seems unmindful of maidens of uncertain age. It is astonishing how years come and go, and little children grow up, and old people totter into the grave, while these maiden ladies like Joshua's sun, seem to stand still in the mid-heav- ens! never grqwing older, grayer, or stooping, but simply sallow and stiffer-not decaying with years, but literally embalmed by time! Such was the powerful founder of the Carean Afri- can Friend's Society! who right valiantly did combat upon the side of her beloved pastor. She had compared Mr. Cary to all sorts of martyrs, and bustled about in his defence with a zeal that was particularly ungratify- ing to the minister's wife! 'Indeed, had Miss Dickey been a beast of burden, she could not have labored more assiduously-bearing ever to the good man's ears the low gossip of the neighborhood; she even wrote an elab- orate defence of that gentleman's tactics, which covered twelve sheets of foolscap. We do not propose to give it. $'   The Carean African Friend's Society was organized, and Miss Dickey was of course honored with the presi- dency. The following is the speech delivered by her upon taking her seat:    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6440-00000050"/> "       THE EBONY IDOL. "Ladies and-(ahem)-Ladies:  "Being called most unexpectedly to occupy this au- gust chair, and preside over the deiberations of this intelligent society, I beg to be allowed to express my deep sense of my own unworthiness, and assure you that to the utmost of my feeble abilities I shall endeavor to discharge my arduous duties witfai faithfulness to my- self and constituents!" \  "Be-au-tiful!" whispered Mrs. Hobbs, nudging her neighbor, to which energetic admiration her friend re- sponded by a wink of approval! "It is well understood that the object of our society is to devise ways and means to alleviate the sufferings of our colored brethren! The best method of procedure is now open for discussion, and we should be glad if you would all express your sentiments and opinions freely!" The silence was profound.  "Don't all speak to once," whispered Mrs. Hobbs. The friend raised the tips of her left hand fingers to her mouth to conceal a bashful giggle.  "Mrs. Baker, will you favor us with your views?  "I do not feel competent to advise," said Mrs. Ba-  ker, modestly; "I am willing to unite heartily in any plan that can ameliorate the sufferings of black or white. I have no definite views in regard to the best method of alleviating the condition of slaves, unless we can give them their freedom and educate them like the whites." :  :^^   TEE EBONY IDO.       95 "I should like to know who is going to educate them," asked Mrs. Smith; "the South won't do it that is certain, and we at the North are overrun now with town paupers and foreigners! If any one wishes to adopt niggers and their progeny, I hope they will have the chance to do it, if that's all!" "I did not say it was expedient or advisable," re- turned Mrs. Baker, pleasantly ; ' I said I did not know how we could benefit the slaves until they were edu- cated." "Now, ladies, I'll tell you what's what! chimed in Mrs. Hobbs ; jest give 'em their liberty, and let 'em tae care oftheirselves therm's Mr. obbs' and my opinion!"   .  "But, my dear, they never have been taught to take care of themselves,"' urged Mrs. Baker; "it would be like casting children into the sea, and expecting them to swim without previous practice!" "How ree-dic-u-lous!" sneered Mrs. Hobbs; " jest as if men and women who have worked all their lives for other folks with lickin, couldnt work for theirselves without lickin'! I say, give 'em liberty--liberty or nurthin'! what's the use of nurthin' at all, if you don't have liberty!, "Well, how will you give them liberty " asked [rs. Smith. "Buy 'ema, if you can't get 'em any other way." "But who will buy them? who can buy them?" YA    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6440-00000051"/> 96        THE EBONY IDOL. Why, abolitioners, of course," shouted Mrs. Hobbs. "My dear woman, all the abolitionists in Minden couldn't buy one black baby, and we are a fair sample, I suppose, of Northern abolitionist. We bear evil fruits enough, I allow, but tLe 'root of all evil' unfor- tunately doesn't flourish in our soil." "Well, i'd buy 'en, any way,'" persisted M1rs. Hobbs. "As Mrs. Baker says," said Mrs. Bryan, "I am willing to aid in every good work, but I must confess I do not see how we can permanently benefit the blacks unless we can educate them in some way; and as that would be the work of ages, I think I should prefer hav- ing them liberated as rapidly as circumstances will admit, and returned to Africa. If we put them back where nature placed them, we at least are not respon- sible for their future unhappiness." "Perhaps not," suggested Mrs. Kimball, "but this generation were not born in Africa; it is no more their country than ours. I don't imagine I should like to be packed off to Africa by my friends." annie laughed. "I did not think of that; I guess, after all, it would be as well to let them alone! "I say buy 'em," cried a voice. "Steal 'em," added a second; and forthwith a violent discussion sprang up, and a jargon of shrill voices rose one above the other, of which nothing was discernible but slave, sla-nig-nig- ger, nigger, nig-Cary, Africa, slave, nigger, ngger, nig Africa-Cary-ni I The secretary held her pen in the   THE EB1ONY IDOL   -    9 most stupid confusion, and " our own correspondent " retired with precipitancy. When they had fatigued themselves with clamor, and exhausted both their breath and their argument, it was discovered that the object of the society was more mystified than at the beginning, since they could not discover even their own motives ol, desires. "For my part," said Mrs. Smith, "I do not see what we have accomplished by our afternoon's meeting." "Why," laughed Nannie, " we have agitated the subject." "And ourselves too," added Mrs. Kimball, dryly. Mrs. Baker advised that a committee of three be appointed to draft resolutions, and decide upon some method of procedure. For one she was ready to assent to any thing. After a good deal of wrangling and loud talking, Mrs. Cary, Miss Dickey, and Mrs. Baker were nomi- nated, and the society adjourned. The next meeting was held at Mr. Smith's, and after the proper preliminaries it was decided to accumulate funds by all available means, prepare articles for sale, and have a fair early in the autumn! This proposition was received with great unanimity, and our friends im- mediately bestirred themselves to gather up cloths and yarn, and were soon absorbed in linen, and needle- books, hosiery, and pin-cushions. 5    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6440-00000052"/> 98        THE EBONY IDOL. Sewing circles of all descriptions are subject to great reverses of favor. One would suppose that being fairly adrift upon their benevolent mission, our friends could have steered their small crafts free of quicksands! But a new difficulty presented itself; as some of the members were more bountifully possessed of this world's goods than others, and had indulged in a little harmless display upon the occasions of their tea drink- ings; the humbler members were not willing to expose the condition of their larder and china closet by endors- ing the refreshments that terminated the afternoon la- bors!"They would prefer to go home before tea!" Mrs. Johnson, who had a pretty plated tea-service, ob- jected decidedly; for her part, she liked to get tea. Nannie, too, who doted upon setting a dainty table, protested it was the most unsocial proposition in the world; it was so pleasant chatting over teacup! Mrs. Baker, who more readily appreciated tre motives for the suggestion, preferred to simplify the affair, arrang- ing the table with the family china, and confining the edibles to-plain bread and cake. Mrs. Kimball said that, although she preferred a good tea, the nicer the better, still she was not difficult about her victuals; she could eat in any way, or any thing, or could go without-any way to keep peace. Mrs. Smith laughingly suggested they should use rice and molasses, as an expression of sympathy for the slave!    ' , o S   THE EBO NY IDOL.      99 Mrs. Hobbs objected to plain cake and bread; she thought they ought to be tfllowed three sorts-for her part, she always wanted doughnuts! The inestimable Mrs. Johnson looked her contempt, while Nannie .and Mrs. Kimball exchanged culinary smiles. Miss Dickey hoped. the unimportant affair of eating would not occupy their attention for a moment. While Afric's sons were bleeding at every pore it ill-became them to " wrangle about the tea-table ;" and so the tea- drinking was referred to a committee."

Now, as if Providence had smiled upon our philan- thropists, and designed signally to reward their ardor, it was just at this time announced to Mr. Cary, by letter, that a fugitive slave, escaped from Alabama, would be forwarded directly to the protection of the Carean Friends Society. Expectation, not satisfied with- the usual tip-toe, got upon stilts. The society was thrown into a humming, buzzing, fluttering condition by this bit of intelligence!                  , Mr. Cary was compelled to read the letter over and over again to little groups in the corners; each of which persisted in misconstruing some passage, and reading the letter for themselves.. The letter was lionized. Mr. Cary was asked all manner of questions, and urged to adopt as many ridiculous stratagems to secure the negro in safety. They would " barrel him up, and roll him in like a barrel of cider!" "They would dress him in female garments!" "They would paint him white!  "They would box him   up like Smyrna   THE EBONY IDOL.      101 figs!"Indeed, the dear creatures exhausted their own philanthropy, and poor Mr. Cary's patience, and went home supremely blest! But the necessity of having some sensible person to act as the agent on the U. R. R., and receive the Ebony treasure at the station was soon seen, and this brings us to a point, where we must introduce to you Frank Stanton, Esq., better known in the neighborhood as Squire Bryan's Adonis! Mr. Stanton was a fun-loving, but otherwise fastidi- ous young gentleman of family and pretensions, a rela- tive of Squire Bryan, with whom he had now been residing some time in elegant leisure under the pretence of " reading law" with the Squire. Of his father and family, nothing was particularly known in Minden, but he was indefinitely understood to be a Southerner. At all reasonable hours, our Adonis might be seen at the office window, his handsome head reposing upon the back of his study chair, his slippered feet resting upon the green baize of the office table, and his grace- ful neglige revealing the daintiest of waistcoats and the most immaculate of linen! Dog-eared Blackstone was forgotten upon the floor, and Story, face downward, reposed upon the window sill, over which the fragrant smoke from the meerscham (" colored ") curled gently up into the outer air. In the smile of our Adonis there was magic and contagion in his clear, ringing laugh! Rich or poor, young or old, were    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6440-00000054"/> 102       THE EBONY IDOL. all alike to him. His smile, his purse, his cap, and his arm, were equally at their service. He was the very best example ever met with of a really " first-rate fellow." The homely, honest phase of Minden life, was novel and charming to him. Hle listened good-naturedly to the garrulity of age, gave a helping hand cheerfully to the over-burdened farmer, praised the home-breived beers of the matrons, And accepted their little im- promptu lunches with the grace of a Pelham. In fine he was the idol of ma'mas, and the adoration of every young lady throughout the township! Especially was he the pet and proteg6 of our heroine, Miss Dickey. If he enjoyed and sometimes encouraged her absurdities, it was rather from intense mirthfulness, than a desire to render her ridiculous in the eyes of others. His versatile and pliable talents made him the safety valve of emergencies, and it was therefore to him that she resorted on the present occasion, for upon her aspresiding officer of the Society devolved the responsibility of the fugitive's safe conduct, and he was her friend. His being himself from the very den of all iniquity, a slave State, did not seem to her as dust in the balance, and, as she had anticipated, he consented to act. This was not all, but we will let the lady speak for herself. "You see, Mr. Stanton," she said, "we are all so absorbed in our dear broller, who is fleeing to us for succor and safety! We, -hat is, the Society, wish to- open our arms (figuratively, of course), and clasp him   THE EBONY IDOL.       103 to our bosoms! Wishing, as we do, to embody our principles' of freedomand equality, so that all the world will understand the position we take, we have thought it would be advisable to take some decisive measures upon this occasion, and "we thought, as we were pass- ing, we would step in and consult you." Frank bowed with his hand upon his heart. "We thought,', continued Miss Dickey, " we would get up some slight demonstration, but as we are not familiar with such things, we shall have to rely upon your kindness in assisting us to arrange it." "Am I to understand, that you wish to get up this demonstration, as you call it, for the express purpose of receiving this negro?"asked Stanton, a little doubtfully. "Exactly, that is it, we wish to receive our forlorn brother.!" Never did merriment peal out in richer laughter, than broke from the lips of our Adonis, as he fell back convulsively upon the lounge; "I beg your pardon," he cried between his explosions, " a thousand, thousand pardons," and the young man wiped his eyes and swept back the hair from his flushed face, only to renew his cachinnations. "My dear Miss Dickey," he cried at last, when he was enabled to control himself, "the thing is most preposterous! for heaven's sake, do not encourage the Society to add this capstone to their ' monyment' for their enemies to laugh at!" Miss Dickey's plumes were rumpled. "You are    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6440-00000055"/> 104       THE EBONY IDOL. very severe," she said, "Mr. Stanton, but where is the absurdity of demonstratirg our gratification over a rescued brother? It is customary to 'receive white gentlemen when they have returned from expeditions in which nothing was accomplished by them particularly praiseworthy! I do not suppose receptions are de- signed to indicate the importance of the individual received, but rather the sta-e of feeling existing among those to whom he is returned; and in this' aspeSt I shall receive him!" "Ha! it is your proposition, then?" and Frank cast a sidelong, roguish glance at his visitor. "Of course, it is," she said with great dignity, and a flush of indignation.  "Ah, excuse me, Miss Dickey; that is quite a different view of the case! i We excuse in individuals, what would be folly in the masses, and who but knows that what your fair hands find to do, you do with your might! I place myself at your disposal-I will aid, abet, and defend you to the last drop of my blood!" and Frank threw himself into an attitude of such chivalric devotion, that Miss Dickey involuntarily pronounced him "charming.", "But seriously," she asked "where is the impro- priety of this reception?" Now our Adonis understood his antagonist too well, not to know that he might a well attempt to annihilate the rocks of Gibraltar with a tack hammer, as convince   TH]E EBONY IDOL.      105 any lady, and this lady in particular, that she was in an error, so he most graciously succumbed!"There was no impropriety."  Miss Dickey was enraptured. Pic-nics, and Will- o'-the-Wisp rambles were her especial favorites. To tug little willow baskets full of bread and butter, up steep, rocky hills, to sit down with a red face, tangled hair, and rent dress upon a little mound, especially devoted to ants' nests, to quaff lukewarm lemonade or brook water from a single tin cup, was the enigmatical charade, for what Miss Dickey called "Delight." Miss Dickey, therefore, would have a pic-nic. Mr. Cary Should open the solemn exercises by prayer, after which should follow singing by the choir, and a poetical address of her own composition, delivered by herself, after which our Adonis should present the Received to be crowned with a wreath of white and black roses, to intimate the good time coming, and the future amalga- mation of the races! To all of which Frank Stanton should be obliging enough to respond, in case the Re- ceived was too much affected to reply! Frank listened with extreme gravity. "My dearest Miss Dickey, nothing can surpass the artistic elegance of your arrangement. rTwo objections occur to me, shall I offend by suggesting them?" O h no." "Being myself a Southerner, I am acquainted with one fact of which you may not be aware; that is, 'hos-    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6440-00000056"/> 106       'filE EBONY IDOL.  quitoes, and black-flies, and all kinds of woodland in- sects are as fond of 'black -blood, as a number one abo- litionist! If you should take that fellow into pine woods, they would scent him a mile off, and every identical mosquito and venomous insect would rush to the scene of action, and get up a reception among themselves, a thousand times more affecting than yours. Now, my dear madam, imagine that poor fellow being compelled ;o listen to poetry under such delicate cir- cumstances even from such lips as yours! To use your own language, 'he Would bleed at every pore!" Miss Dickey glanced suspiciously at Frank's immov- able countenance. "Secondly, it is very difficult for ladies to speak in the open air, so as to be audible to the crowd. For this reason, I would suggest, that the reception take place at Glynn's Lotel, where the ceremony could be enacted upon the piazza, and the audience would have the ad- vantage of standing below you. Beside, we could have supper, and toasts, a good social time, and a hop in the evening." Miss Dickey, who had fancied her- self arrayed as a sylvan nymph, hovering above the enraptured black-knight, dazzling his eyes with her beauty, as she encircled his brow with roses and his heart with love, could not resign her pretty imaginings, without some pangs of regret. Yet her poetical address could not be perilled, and she accepted Mr. Stanton's amendment. \,c   THE EBONY IDOL.      107 Every thing was arranged entirely to Miss Dickey's satisfaction. Stanton having solemnly pledged himself to keep the fugitive in the background until the auspi- cious moment arrived for presentation, Miss Dickey departed, and immediately bestirred herself to engage the people to cooperate in her benevolent enterprise. As might be expected, landlord Glynn was zealous for the reception. He avowed himself ready to cater for black and white, to spare no " pains or expense," to entertain man and beast, and to extend invitations abroad by every facility in his power.  Mr. Gary was too sensible to tolerate such an absur- dity. He reasoned and refused,; and it was only when he found the reception persisted in, that he gave his unwilling consent to unite with them. Squire Bryan considered it "rich." Mr. Smith rubbed his hands with great glee, and shouted, "Give me niggers, or give me death!" Colonel Johnson and his " inestimable lady " consented to be present, because the reception was such an "uncommon occasion," while Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs bustled about, entering into the business minutia with great gravity and zeal. Upon the day when the Society met to complete its arrangements, Miss Dickey might be seen with her little cork-screw curls all atremble, fluttering from one member to another, like an autumnal butterfly among frost-bitten astors. \    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6440-00000057"/> CHAPTER XII. --This Is he Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.-TITus ADRONIoVUS. Now after Miss Dickey's departure, Mr. Frank Stanton ventured to indulge in some reflections upon "dirty work," the result of which was that Mr. Frank Stanton had a private interview with Mr. Hobbs, dur-, ing which a bank note changed hands, and Mr. Hobbs pledged himself, his word, and his honor, with Mrs. Hobbs' entire approval, to bring up the Ebony treasure, into the goodly land of .inden, and Frank Stanton returned, at his ease, to rejbice over the transfer of his laurels, and make merry with his wise mentor! Late in the afternoon, as Mr. Hobbs was perfecting his arrangements for an early start in the morning, he found himself Ate-a-tete with Squire Bryan. "How is i;, friend Hobbs," asked the latter, mis- chievously, " tLat you have been enticed into this expe- dition? Have you taken into consideration the dangers you may encounter " "Dangers!" echoed Hobbs, "can't a man travel   THE EBONY IDOL.      109 fifty miles over good New England roads, about his own business, without getting his life insured?" "But suppose this negro is pursued by his master, backed up by constables with bowie knifes and revolvers,  and a troop of blood-hounds," asked the Squire with a shrug, " and you answerable to the law, for aiding in the abduction of a slave! eh?" The scales fell from the eyes of our Philanthropist. N "Is that why Stanton wants me to go instead of himself?" asked Hobbs suspiciously. "Possibly!" Hobbs was silent and thoughtful. "Let me bid you farewell," said the Squire, extend- ing his hand with a face expressive of the most dolorous commiseration. "If," he added, "evil should befall you, you may rely upon my remembrance of your widow!" During that tedious night, as Hobbs lay upon his bed, reflecting upon his perilous journey, he tossed, and tumbled, and lashed his imagination with all sorts of indefinite dangers. What flocks of phantom sheep he drove over imaginary stone walls! With what weari- ness of spirit he counted through hundreds and thou- sands and millions and billions! How frantically he rolled his eyes from right to left and left to right! Occasionally he dozed, wakefully, and groaned aloud as he. saw in the cold moonlight the bleached skeletons of runaway slaves, gnashing their teeth at him    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6440-00000058"/> "O       THE EBONY IDOL. in ghastly despair; or, pursued by panting blood- hounds, he struggled to fly; only to fall at their very feet, and be scorched by their hot breath. Finally his eyes closed, and, from pure exhaustion, our friend slept -aye, and dreamed! The way was long and dark, and full of obstales, the slave was beside him, not man, or ghost, but a being so awfully mysterious, that his very blood curdled, as they drove on in the dead silence! Ha! the neg1io springs upon him-grasps him! throttles him! ,Mercy! mercy! "Now, yeou Hobbs! what on arth are you a shak- ing me, after that are fashion, for " shrieked his ami- able spouse.

What trifles loom up, bearing down upon us with the blackest of piratical flags, refusing all compromise with conscience, anl stifling the very atmosphere with hor- rible phantasies! A hundred times had Hobbs ar- ranged his las, Will and testament! a hundred times did his disconsolate widow, trailing in black bombazine glide around his unsodden grave! Like imperial Charles he exen rehearsed, in imagination, his own ltrial, and ch ated the bass to his own requiem!

Gradually she grew confident, and smiled so cheerfully upon the homely furniture and uncarpeted floor, that the nervous victim half smiled at his own: apprehension! How impa- tiently he listened to the heavy breathing of his sleep- ing partner, who, heartless sinner, snoozed away, utterly indifferent to their approaching separations! Mrs. Hobbs, all unconscious of the mental solicitude of her dearly beloved, slept on with that depth and abandon, so natural to pure animal health, her unadorned night cap forming a most unpoetical -setting to the round, florid, and altogether ugly face, that pointed its pug nose to the ceiling, and blew its own trumpet in a man- ner perfectly astounding to even Iobbs. Mr. Hobbs listened to this tuneful nightingale, with great conjugal forbearance, until an unusually prolonged and sonorous inspiration aroused' even the sleeper herself. "Hobbs," she muttered indistinctly through her dry throat, "how you do snore!" "Snore!" cried the .accused, with a nervous vio- lence, only justifiable by his nightmares!"I'll tell you what it is, Miss Hobbs, you have kept me awake all night! 'Tis a shocking bad habit of yours, and if I had know'd you snored, I never would have married you!" "Married me, indeed!" retorted the lady, her eyes flying wide open with a snap, not unlike the capsule of the garden balsam when too rudely pressed!"Didn't    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6440-00000059"/> "2       THE EBONY IDOL.

He repeated the ominous words of Squire Bryan, and suggested his own doubts in regard to his personal safety. Finally he repeated his-ominous dream, and intilnated his determination to send for Squire Bryan and make Lis will! "Make a fiddle-stick!" cried Mrs. Hobbs; who, whatever her defidiencies might be, was not wanting in courage. "If I couldn'. hoe my own row with one nigger, I'd have pluck enough to die game!" Mr. Hobbs, who was expecting some pretty little outhurst of connubial affection to follow this affecting allusion to his death, was not a little irritated at this unreasonable resignation. "Miss Hobbs," he sa'd solemnly, and with nasal accent, "you'll see the time when you'll think of- this 'ere!" Mrs. Hobbs snorted out her contempt. "You jest hand me  over that ten dollar bill that Stanton gave you, and I'll bring the nigger, in less than no time, so you can save your bacon!" This proposal was very fair, there was no denying   TI'E EBONY IDOL.      113 that! and although the husband was-not a little sur- prised at 'the coolness of the proposition, still "his bacon " was not a consideration to be overlooked by him- self, whatever might be the estimation in which it was held by his better half! Beside, the ten spot would re- main " in-the family ",if " the worst " should befall her, and, he remembered with pleasure that however effica- cious " bed-bug poison " had been deemed to assuage the grief of unrequited love while single, it had never been recommended as an antidote for a widower's grief! ^ "My dear," he said, " you are a woman of remark- able courage! I always knew that!"  "And you *re a man of remarkable little, and I allers knew that!" blurted out the woman, who could never bear to be " my dear'd." Hobbs winced. "I was going this morning," he said hesitatingly, I you couldn't--" "Yes, I could!" cried Mrs. Hobbs, "but you jest mind this, I shan't stir one peg, till that bill is mine." "Half," suggested Hobbs.

"Snooky!" ejaculated Mrs. Hobbs, as the money touched her palm. "It's a bargain!" and in just sixty minutes, Mrs. Hobbs was seated in the centre of the yellow farm waggon, a rain in each hand, a whip and basket of lunch by her side, and a bag of oats in the rear. The horse, the. waggon, and the notable dame simultaneously turned their backs upon Minden, and Mr. Hobbs was left a widower in perspective. As- Mrs. Hobbs rolled over the road, vigorously plying the horsewhip, and by sundry jerkings of the reins and chirrupings, intimating her impatience of delay, it is not to be inierred that she lavished senti- ment upon the natural beauties of the scenery. The rumbling vehicle glided by charming rivulets, gurg- ling and singing between banks verdant with rich mosses and tangled vines, while all down among moss- covered rocks, tufts of blue and white violets modestly concealed their beauty beneath their shields of green. The rich, carmine, cardinal flower, rose imperious from the rank ferns, and clusters of wild blue lupine, and nodding honeysuckles vainly filled the air with un- coveted perfume. The plaintive flute bird, whistled its dreamy notes in the solitary forests of dark pine, and the bob-o'-link, and golden robins, the wild canary, and the blue jay darted around her, their brilliant plumage flashing in the golden sunshine, until even the   THE EBONY IDOL.        115 jaded horse bent his ears to listen, and looked wistfully up, into the deep shaded hill-sides.  But Mrs. Hobbs, alone, earnest .for the accomplish- ment of her individual mission, chirruped, and jerked, and plashed, unmindful of the scorching sun, beguiling her moments of repose by humming snatches of old love songs and murderous legends, or giving her un- musical voice free execution in this her favorite ballad.

The repast completed, Mrs. Hobbs shdok the crumbs from    her dress, twisted some green leaves into an emerald goblet, and drank, without mentioning it, to her own success. Then leading her brute companion to the water, and patting his neck to signify their mutual satisfaction, she slipped the thills into the harness, and resumed her journey.'

The man sprang nimbly in behind. "What on arth are you in there for ?" she asked curtly, as she looked for his whereabouts. "Get out." She was obeyed. "There," said the womran, planting herself firmly upon the left side of the wLggon, " set down there, and drive. " " Beg pardon, missus, dis nigger can't dribe." "Cant drive," cried the dame, opening her round eyes in astonishment, st what on arth is the reason you can't drive ?" "Beg pardon, missus, its nigger nebber larned how!" To Mrs. Hobbs, the very idea of being learned to drive, was intensely absurd; she had always known how. "Never learned how to trive,  " she repeated slowly. " Did I ever ?

"Snooky!" and Mrs. Hobbs was speechless from sieer wonder! Gradually Mrs. Hobbs became familiar with the dark complexion and national lineaments of her com- panion, and exercised her curiosity and loquaciousness upon her new acquaintance without stint or measure. Caesar, who was not slow in perceiving her readiness to give full credence to his most absurd relations, and was not reluctant to have himself considered a hero, poured into her willing ear a most lavish account of his suffer- ings. His deprivations and personal corpulency might have seemed incongruous to a physiological listener, but Mrs. Hobbs was no skeptic, and was prepared to believe in any evil that traced its origin to slavery I    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6440-00000062"/> 1 18      THE EBONY IDOL. The nine o'clock bell was pealing out its warning for all dames to put their'houses in order for the night, and for peace-loving citizens to seek their own homes, when our weary travellers rolled up to the sfde door of Mr. Hobbs' farm house, and were greeted ith great cor- diality by little Mary, upon whom the housekeeping duties had devolved during the absencei of her foster- mother. She had been " so anxious," she said, in the most musical of voices, and her silvery laugh rippled out upon the quiet night air, as she ran to notify her father of the arrival. He, good man, was smoking his clay pipe in the sitting-room window, with his heavy boots upon the window sill, utterly oblivious to all terrestrial objects! With, great composure, and evidently with some re- luctance, he knocked the as es from his short-stemmed pipe, and proceeded to welcome his wife with bluff good nature, and off-hand raillery. Mrs. Hobbs was invulnerable, and as she came- to the ground, ordered her liege lord to "drive that fellow straight to the young Squire's office." Our Adonis was enjoying the evening by the open window, his handsome  head reposing upon his clasped hands, nursing his feeble ambition by the rays of the bloody Mars, or seeking inspiration from the imperious Venus.

"Hobbs, take the fellow over to Glynn's, and tell him to give him supper, bed, and breakfast, at;my expense, and keep him under lock and key until I see him!" "All right," cried Hobbs, retreating. "Confound the nigger," cried Stanton, springing up, and dashing down the window angrily, he turned the key in the office-door, and strode nervously out into the dewy night air.    <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6440-00000063"/> rI                I   CHAPTER    XIII. The wealthy curled darlings of our nation.-OTHELLO. THE day destined to be known in the annals of Min- den as the day of "the reception," came in pleasantly. The sun laughed and danced, and quivered with delight, as it peeped over the green hill-tops. The birds, true to their early mass, poured forth such rich gushes of melody, that little Mary, who was already astir, thought they must know that another spirit had become free like their own. The air was moist and balmy, and all day long the soft breezes swept over the village green, and nature seemed vying with man to welcome a soul to freedom. Young Stanton, having completed his very perfect toilet, wended his way to the hotel' to enact his own pait in the day's drama. As he entered the room in which Coesar had been deposited to await his arrival, the two confronted each other with countenances which, however differently they might express astonishment, : r  X ^ r   THE EBONY IDOL.       121 were equally suggestive of a most unexpected recog- nition! "What brought you here, sir?" asked Stanton, sternly, as the truth dawned upon him, and he beheld before him a negro from his own father's plan- tation.           ' "Lor' Gor 'Mighty!" cried Caesar, throwing him- self upon his knees before Stanton; "who'd ebber a thought of findin' Mass' Frank, way up here 'mong dese-'ere mountings?

"Fine doings, this," he muttered, " conniving at the escape of father's negro, and exhibiting him before all Minden as a speci- men of abused humanity!

Frank, whose brow had gathered blackness as Caesa proceeded, sprang to his feet, and with a tone of de cision, said, "Cesar, there is but one course to be pursued i] this silly affair; you must return directly to my father If you go quietly, so much the better; my own privat4 opinion is, that your loss is his gain; but I have m: duty to perform as his son, and you have yours as  servant.

"Then God forbid that my hand should blast, the sweet 'promise of that heaven-implanted instinct! ' / cried Stanton. A painful silence ensued. Frank slowly pacing the room, endeavoring to reconcile his duty with his per- sonal desires; Caesar, still kneeling, gazed after him with mingled stupor and/ despair. His fate was trem- bling upon his young master's lips! "To whom have you revealed your master's name? asked Stanton.

Stanton regarded him a moment W vith a searching glance, which seeming satisfactory, and said, "Very well, Coesar; now listen to me, and let me tell you exactly what freedom will be to you. Do not think, because you have been so warmly welcomed by your Northern friends, that you will not need to labor. It is true, you will be a free man, and eat free bread, but let me tell you even Yankee bread has to be paid for. There is hardly one man in a hundred of all these who have encouraged your desertion of my father, who would put his hand into his pocket and give you a dol- lar, if it was to save you from the gutter! While the excitement continues, they will take you to their homes for a few days, and then cast you adrift, to sink or swim. You will find few of your own color with whom to associate, and you will be shunned by the Northern- ers, to whom your color and habits are not familiar.

"Free, then, let it be," exclaimed Stanton, with de- cision; " but mark me, it is only upon this one condi- tion, you shall never confess or betray to living man that you have ever known me or my father. If by any accident you should do so, I shall at once inform my father where you may be found." Caesar could not but be corscious of the magnani- mity of his young master's decision. He dropped upon his knees, and with genuine tears and rude pathos poured forth in broken eloquence the gratitude of his heart "Now tears are like the rain, which soothes the thunder; They keep the heart from splitting quite asunder!" and Caesar having relieved the pressure of gratitude to the heart, by this flow of emotion, wiped his swarthy face upon his coat sleeve, and grew radiant with com- placency. "And now, Caesar, when this exhibition is over, reember this-you are never to accost me, or look at me, or notice me any mrore than you would an entire stranger; if you do 't will lead to your de-    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6440-00000066"/> 126       THE EBONY IDOL.. tection. If you get into trouble, do not seek me, and if you break your promises to me, remember-" and Frank twirled his cane significantly. "Remain here until you are sent for;" and Stanton; turning the key upon the- illustrious guest, left Caesar to his own reflec- tion, and more especially to his own admiration. No sooner were Frank's retreating footsteps heard upon the stairs, than Caesar, with a slight toss of his ambrosial curls, proceeded to take a long and most gratifying survey of himself in a little mahogany-framed looking-glass that adorned his prison walls. He was, of course, "got up" for the occasion, and no peacock was ever vainer of his bright-eyed plumage, or strutted with half the vanity with which Caesar now spread himself, as advancing, retreating, and revolving before the mirror, he regarded his apparel and grinned his de- light. Directly he commenced a kind of pantomime with his own reflection; first he adopted the airs of the fop, and substituting the glass stopple of the cologne stand for. an eye-glass, he ogled his blacker half with a persistency that would have cast many a shameless whited" swell " into the shade. He next assumed the character of the man of the world, and with great suavity shook hands with him- self, :offered himself a chair, seated himself, extended to himself the civility of the snuff-box, and flourished his white cambric with evident admiration of his own elegance. ,    THE +BOYNY IDOL.      127 From the gentleman 'he glided into the lover; with his hand upon his heart, poor Coesar sighed and wheezed like a dying porpoise! The Lames of Cupid seemed about to envelop his oleaginous person; he pressed his yellow kids to his thick lips, and languished until he seemed in actual danger of consuming from spontane- ous combustion. Below stairs, meanwhile, mine host of the inn, flushed with importance, is bustling about from room to room, giving his orders with the shrill tone and ner- vous haste of one unaccustomed to great occasions. With every fresh arrival the hostler is sure to be miss- ing, and has to be hunted up by the excited landlord, who invariably finds him with both hands plunged in his breeches pockets, and his jockey cap poised upon one ear, peering at the preparations through the open door. The gentleman at the "bar" was really the only man of steady habits. In the good old times of yore, liquors were conspicuously displayed above the bar; but even in IMinden, decanters had lost their respecta- bility, and were arranged for evasion. Still the bar- tender is in great demand upon show-days, and pours his ' cooling drinks" with the air of a man who ap- preciates his own importance! Without, the old, worn, half-painted hotel was doing its very best to look young and cheerful; evergreens were flaunting and trailing from pillar and post, gaudy    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6440-00000067"/> 128       THE EBONY IDOL. bouquets arranged in all kinds of old china, and dilapi- dated pitchers coquettishly displayed their beauties from the open windows ; and little flags, with blackened stripes and stars, streamed out from eveiry available cor- ner. But the portico was the gayest of all, and was v written all over with Miss Dickey's initials! In the centre was erected a small rustic throne, over-arched with branches of oak and white pines, interspersed with wreaths and bouquets, aqd appropriate mottoes. Wood cuts of slaves writhing beneath the lash, or suing for mercy, were suspended in conspicuous places, and noth- ing was omitted which could give expression or pi- quancy to the occasion. Tle people stood around and below, gazing, criticiz- ing, and prophesying, as the crowd are wont to do, while beneath the pretty shade trees of the village green, the horses of economical visitors gnawed the juicy bark from their unprotected stems, or leisurely browsed the rich herbage at their feet. As the hour of ceremony approaches, the crowd grows more dense, and Yankee speculations are opened in horse sheds, with jack-knives and silver watches; molasses candy, pop corn and lozenges circulate, and snap crackers are beginning to be heard at a distance.

"One o'clock at last," cried the weary and heated expectants; and a slight ustle upon the balcony was the precursor to the swaying of the crowd below. Short and small people elongated them- selves by standing upon tiptoe, and stretching their necks to almost fabulous extensions. Tall and bulky individ- uals, who could have seen from any position, elbowed their way to the most desirable locations, where with their hats under their arms they enlarged their general outl'nes, greatly to the annoyance of the shorts, who kept up a series of dodgings for bird's-eye views. Small children were knocked over, and stepped upon like so many puppies, and in incitation of that quadru- ped gave audible intimation of their resentment, while   THE EBONY IDOL.       131 mammas muttered out their indignation, without regard to musical cadence. Finally, Mr. Cary, the Receiving Committee, and Miss Dickey passed the open door, and took their positions upon the decorated piazza. A few leading members of the choir r ext appeared, whom the chorister arranged with the viol here, and the bass there; and the stout, florid girl, with two spit curls upon each temple, was placed side by side with Mary Hobbs. And so the actors arrange, and are arranged, and when precision is gratified, Mr. Cary, with uplifted hands, says solemnly, "Let us invoke the blessing of God," and being a sincere hearted man, striving to do his duty as he sees it, pours forth an eloquent and ear- nest supplication that slavery may cease from off the face of the earth. The singing of the "African's Lament," those old, familiar words, the reading o: which has made many an embryo abolitionist, was next in order. Despite the low thunder of the bass and the squealing of the abomi- nable fiddle, or the loud, strong notes of the maid with the spit curls, a gushing, warbling, bird-like music steals above, beneath, and around, the universal harshness, which we at once identify as he notes of the fairy with the golden hair, little Mary Hobbs. When the music ceased, -he people were quiet and decorous; but no sooner did Caesar appear upon the platform, with glossy face ard magnificent attire, than the crowd swayed again. Not one in twenty of that    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6440-00000069"/> 132       THE EBONY IDOL. assembly had ever before beheld a negro, and all ex- pected to behold in him an outcast of the forlornest as- pect, bearing every mark of cruelty and servility. Imagine then the disappointment, and our faithfulness as a chronicler of human nature compels us to add, the chagrin and regret of the beholders, to see not an object of p'ty and tears, but a stalwart, portly, gross African, with the smoothest and blackest of skins, clothed in blue broadcloth with gilt buttons, a buff vest, snowy linen with ruffles, and gloves the most spotless of Alex- ander's best-an outfit mischievously furnished, as the reader will remember, by Mr. Frank Stanton. The very air grew heavy'with his perfumeries, and if any thing could have surpssaed the folly of his exterior, I it most assuredly was found in the overwhelming im- portance of his swagger, and the truly negro, but ut- terly indescribable " fine frenzy " with which he rolled his eyes over the spectators, and looked his conscious- ness cf being "a distinguished individual." For a mo- ment the silence was intense, and at that fatal instant, some youngster of the inpish party, regardless of con- fections and free seats at second tables, shouted at the top of his lungs, "Oh, I'm the best looking nigger in the county--Oh! and the final "oh" was caught up  and bandied about by the outsiders with such wonder- ful inJections and elongations, that the crowd began slightly to hiss, then to clap, to laugh and hurra, until the hubbub was complete!   THE EBONY IDOL.       133 "Does your mother know ypu're out?" cried a voice from the crowd!"'Go it, slippers," cried an- other, who had a glimpse of the white hosiery!"What's the price of cologne?" yells a third!"Any more ruffles where them come from?" asks a fourth! '"Don't soil your gloves, dear," and then prolonged cheers. Now Caesar had been instructed by Stanton to bow very low when the clapping was coupled with his name, and in his excitement, not comprehending the confusion, he faced about, and with his gloved hand upon his buff waistcoat, bowed so exceedingly low, that some one moving behind him came in contact with his person, and had well-nigh precipitated him into the upturned faces of his admirers! Here Mr. Cary rose, and intimating by a wave of his hand his wish to be heard, entreated them to be si- lent, as a personal favor to himself. Order and quiet restored, the ceremonies were concluded entirely to the satisfaction of all interested parties. The gaunt figure of Miss Dickey within the'rural arch looked exceed- ingly comfortless in her dress of white book muslin, than which nothing could be stiffer, unless indeed it was surpassed by the little corkscrew curls, that maiden la- dies for some unaccountable reason insist upon wearing, "in such a winterish way." The address, which we forbear giving for reasons of our own not related to its excellence, was in Miss Dickey's " own peculiar and beautiful style."   . t)    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6440-00000070"/> 134       THE EBONY IDOL. he reply was in Frank Stanton's best manner. To this day we have never been able to decide in our own minds whether it was the consciousness of the presence of sweet little Mary, or the rays that shot from the laughing eyes of Squire Bryan; that so electrified and inspired him! The crowning of Caesar's brow with the typical wreath of black and white roses, was received with im- mense applause ; and when Caesar acknowledged this attention by the presentation of an immense bouquet, and a salute of her fair hand, more cordial than grace- ful, the village rung with acclamations! But dinner was waiting in the dining hall, and the porcine suckling, who had laid down his life for Coesar, was reposing upon " all fours " in the centre of the ta- ble, awaiting an attack, with the stoicism that only roasted pork can assume. At either extremity of the table were placed the very familiar plaster-of-Paris images, known as the "Kneeling Samuel," which our original typifier, Miss Dickey, had painted black for the occasion; the one bearing as a placard the Macedonian cry, "Come over and help us!" the other, the memorable war- cry of Patrick Henry, "Give me liberty,or give me death!" Little wreaths of white and black roses were thrown around their necks, to intimate the good time coming, while bouquets, vines, parsleys and mints, and dishes 4   THE EBONY IDL.       1 garnished with hard-boiled eggs and sliced lemons gave a holiday appearance to the repast, which, blending with the savory odors of roast meats and plum-pud- dings, must have produced a very agreeable sensation among such of the party as were interested in tickets at fifty cents each! Of all earthly blessings, almost the only one that does not "brighten as it takes its flight is a public dinner! The fearful wreck of every edible upon the table bore witness to the comfortable conviction, that neither excessive joy at Cesar's liberty, or grief for his brethren in bonds, had affected the appeites of our philanthro- pists! Indeed, had the multitude been twice as glad at Csesar's arrival, they could rot possibly have eaten twiceas mueh! But they had nade themselves as com- fortable as they could at their own expense, and as Da- vid said, if that did not arouse he South to a sense of their sin, he did: not know what would! L  The crowd, weary with surfeiting and confusion, began to disperse. As: Stanton slipped his fee into the willing palm of the landlord, He took occasion to say that he was no longer responsib-e for Caesar's bills, and that he would do well to exercise a timely regard to his own interests in that respect. A second hint was not required by the wary landlord, who, watching his opportunity, fastened his distiguished guest upon no less a personage than the Rev. r.

It was not to be expected that the addition to the family of a fat and lazy negro was very agreeable to the clergyman's wife. The quiet and comical man ner in which, as that of'a poor pastor, family found it necessary to live, had been rendered or tolerable by the skilful management of Mrs. Cary, who perform- ed her own household labors. The cottage was small but comfortable, and the one " spare bed,' which in the country is almost always a miracle of snowy linen and oft feathers, was the only one now in readiness for the sable guest. Mrs. Cary, with a perplexed brow, when Casar was once fairly in the house, and it became necessary to provide for him, beckoned her husband to this littlev sanctum. "Only think, my dear, of putting Caesar in here," she cried, in a tone of vexation. i    THE EBONY IDOL.       137 Mr. Cary glanced at the fre h linen and spotless coverlet, the clean straw matting and gossamer white window drapery; and'it must be confessed it did seem him to be a kind of profanation. The two exchanged comical glances. "But what other arrangemen can be made?" asked the wife, anxiously. '"You might put him into Lucy's room, and put Lucy in here," suggested the hus and. "Bless me," cried Mrs. Cary, ' the child never could be persuaded to sleep there agair so long as she lived; she is already so afraid of Cesar that she shuts her eyes to avoid seeing him." " Well, my dear, fit it to suit yourself," cried the puzzled clergyman, and he returned to his study. Mrs. Cary bethought her of a vacant room in the rear of the building, in which she satisfactorily prepared lodgings for her guest; and thither he was escorted to dream over his triumphs. The day following was de- voted to village explorations, and Caesar found himself a very acceptable addition to the group that daily con- gregated upon the piazza of the dynn Hotel. He soon discovered also that he was expected to gratify their curiosity to the fullest extent, a d that he was petted in proportion to the magnitude nd marvellousness of the falsehoods he invented. So Caesar went on' from one suffering to another, until it may-be doubted where his experience would have ended, had not Frank Stan-     <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6440-00000072"/> 138 138     TIlTE EBONY IDOL. ton at some critical moments joined the concourse of lis- teners. And so day after day passed until the loungers com- menced to grow weary of the often, repeated stories  and dropped away from the rehearsal. Then Cmsar turned his attention to things indoors, and as a natural result mostly slept the mornings away in the sunny windows of Mrs. Cary's dining room, much to the an- noyance of that notable dame.  Cesar," she said one morning when he was en- sconcing himself in his favorite sunshine," perhaps you would like to work a litle in the garden. There are always weeds to be renoved, and my husband finds very little time for such things." "Dat mighty small garding of your'n, missey," blurted Cesar, with undisguised contempt;, "no gemman would tink of'weedin' such garding as dat-are! Missey ought for to see my ole massa's garding! Gor, dat was garding as is a garding! "It answers our purpose very well, at all events; I work in it myself sometimes." "or de Yankees all niggers! Dis chile like for to see hisole missey workinground in dat-are way. De Soufern ladies am ladies as is ladies!" rs. Cary bit her lip in silence, and after a little yawning, Coesar gave himself up to his favorite siesta with his suspicious-looking head and shoulders upon. the dining! table.   THE EBONK IDOL.       139 An hour or two after, M)rs. Cary's quick, firm tread was heard upon the study threshold. "Mr. Cary, I wish you would have the kindness to step down and get Cesar out of the dining-room. The odor is perfectly intolerable. H has been dozing upon the table these two hours, and i, is my humble opinion his head never was familiar with the sweets of soli- tude!"  The clergyman gave a little shrug of impatience. "My dear, you have interrupted a most valuable logical elucidation which I greatly fear me has vanished for good. Could not you have awakened him?" "He is no visitor of mine,) cried the good lady testily, " though I plead guilty to having been poking him for the last half hour with the broom-handle. If he is to remain here much longer, I shall certainly send him into the study; for, as for having him around my, cooking apartments, I will not!" Mr.. Cary whistled; and after a little reflection, shuffled down stairs. It is to 3e confessed that as his eyes fell upon the uncouth, swarthy figure of the sleep- ing fugitive, a half-framed wish that he was back in the cotton-fields presented itself. "Caesar, wake up, sir, th3 room is wanted for dinner." The sleeper gave no sign. "Cesar," cried the clergyman, more energetically, going a little closer, and punching him with the blunt    <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6440-00000073"/> "O       THE EBONY IDOL. end of his pen holder.-"Wake up, sir,-do you hear?"  A snort of-resentment followed the pointed, appeal, and after various elongations of his extremities, not mentioned by Chesterfield as indicative of good breed- ing, Cssar rubbed his eyes with his fists and bon- descended to turn the white of them toward the ex- B pectant"Mr. Cary. "Tink a nigger might enjoy his'sef some way or nudder," grunted Caesar. "The room is required for dinner, sir," the clergy- man repeated sternly. "The dining-room isi9 place for sleeping.

"Chamber!" growled Casar; "Lor' Gor 'Mighty -dis chile aint use to sleepin in such cubbey-hole as dat-ar'e." , "Am I to understand that you find fault with your lodging-room, sir?" demanded the master of the house, testily. "Yah! yah!" laughed Cesar insultingly, "dis chile knows what am wha;. Haint lib all he life mong gemman as is gemman fur nurthin!"

There is a cord of wood- at the door, and if you prefer   '    o  THE EBONY IDOL.       141 o exercise, you can amuse yourself by sawing and plitting it." Caesar's eyes dilated. "Dis chile didn't come norf to be made a nigger of. )is free land, I spose!" "But you must understand, Caesar, that labor is lonorable at the North. You .an enjoy freedom, it is rue, but not its blessings without industry. I labor nyself."  "Tink dat!" snorted Caesar, rolling his eyes insult- ugly over the somewhat seedy exterior of the clergy- aan. "Gemmans as is gemmans, 'pears like gemmans s is gemmans."  The blood rushed hot and tingling to Mr. Cary's heek, and for an instant his lips quivered with resent- aent. But suppressing his anger, the clergyman urned upon his heel and wended his why to the tudy. Mrs. Cary, to repress her resentment laid the dinner able in the kitchen. The domestic atmosphere was vidently becoming hazy. Caesar, in the meanwhile, mused himself by making faces at little Lucy, when- ver he could do so unseen, occasionally pulling her pon his knees, and smothering her with kisses, which o terrified and disgusted the child, that she avoided Lim, as she would the plague of Egypt. When she omplained of these grievances; and Mrs. Cary kindly emonstrated with Csesar, thinking that it was his color    <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6440-00000074"/> "2       THE EBONY IDOL. and uncouthness that had offended her daughter, Caesar grew malicious, and hating the child, drove her  half frantic with persecutions. She came to fear him, too,-and durst not betray him, as she had at first done, so that unwittingly she grew peevish and nervous, cling- ing to her mother by day, and shrieking with, terror when left alone for the night. It chanced one day, that Mrs. Cary sat sewing between the mirror and CZesar, and looking up casually, detected the fellow in the very act of distorting his V II  i"iJ.          i i:n:i   THE EBONY IDOL.       143 face so hideously, that for the instant, her own terror petrified her. Glancing at Lucy, she beheld her rigid and pale, staring at him with a kind of stony fascina- tion, more fearful to encounter than the distortions of the negro. To clasp the child in her arms and bear her to the study, was the work of an instant, and then the good woman's wrath broke forth. "Mr. Cary, we may as well understand each other first as last. Either Caesar or Lucy must leave the house. I have borne with his insolence as long as respect to you or duty to my family will allow," and Mrs. Cary poured forth such a chapter of grievances as startled the clergyman with fears for her sanity. Lucy still limp and pallid bore full testimony to all she suffered, and now that she felt certain of safety, told of a thousand annoyances of which her patents never dreamed. Mr. Cary listened in silent indignation. "You may bring Csesar here," he said, at last, in a low voice; and the man was/brought, But no sooner did Caesar catch a glimpse of the group within, than comprehending his dilemma, he clasped his hands upon his sides, and howling with pretended anguish, threw himself helplessly into Mrs. Cary's sewing chair. Now this sewing chair had been the gift of a dear deceased friend, and was, beside, the only bit of elegance, which adorned the parsonage; a small black walnut in gothic style, and quite too deli-    <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6440-00000075"/> "      THE EBONY IDOL. cate for "coarser souls." When, therefore, the dis- traught monster transferred his theatricals to that seat of empire; he reckoned without his host, for no sooner did he come in contact with the dainty damask, than the treacherous legs gave way, and Caesar lay "around loose." The pangs of the poor fellow's abdomen and their accompanying contortions, which he had designed to have identified with those that had so'frightened the child, Were instantly allayed by the ruin he had wrought, and he sprang to his feet protesting "dat dam chair broke he own dam-se." Mrs.,Cary darted a glance at her good man, which seemed to implicate him as the author of all her evils, and banging the door behind her, left the two lords alone in their glory. Mr. Cary picked up the wreck of what he knew to be the pride of his wife's heart, with a deep sigh of despair; and sat down to look at Caesar, which he did  in such a pensive, studious, despairing manner, that the latter intuitively comprehended the contempt and pity of the mute expression.      *  Dr.. Cary's first impulse had been to order him from  the house, but as he gazed into the sullen and stupid face before him, his heart softened toward what he con. ; sidered so fine a specimen of the total depravity of man. He is, he thought, but one of the vast family of that unfortunate race whom we have undertaken to i  :   THE EBONY IDOL.       145 rescue from bondage. Their salvation must be effected individually, and perhaps to me is to be given this man's most precious soul for keeping.    4 As these thoughts revolved themselves in .the clergyman's mind, he asked Limself, what was his own individual duty toward this sable brother whom Provi- dence seemed designedly to Lave intrusted to his care. Should he faint upon the very threshold of the effort? And if he cast him out as a graceless vagabond, who could he expect would 'jefriend him. Beside all this, would not the world laugh him to scorn for failing to practise his own precepts? Mr. Cary thought and whistled, and whistled and thought. "Caesar," he said solemnly, " what has my little daughter done, that you should persecute a child of her tender years. Do you not know how easily children can be-ruined in body and intellect by unduly exciting their fears?" 'It was impossible to discover, by the man's face, whether he even understood the mild language ad- dressed to him, certainly he condescended to give no 'intimation vterbally, that he did! , "Answer me, CGesar. Why did you frighten my child?" Lor' Gor 'Mighty, Massa Cary, hope you don't tink dis nigger go for to frighten dat blessed cheru- bim?

Oh, Lor'! I'se gwoin into 'it agin for sartin!" and embracing the portion of his corporeal system which had, been so fatally endowed by maternal affection, Caesar hugged, and yelled, and rolled up his eyes, until the clergyman bent over him with undisguised alarm. "Oh, Gor!" cried CCesar, as the temporary pangs subsiled, and he withdrew one arm to fan himself with his hand, "just' to tick of agonizing like dat-ar', and len be 'cused of going fur to frighten dat angel chile!" It was impossible for the unsophisticated witness of this impromptu attack, to decide satisfactorily, whether the agonizing was real or fictitious, but as he was him- self a dyspeptic and no small victim to flatulency, he was rathers inclined to the opinion that Caesar had lavished an extra amount of groans upon a small capital of mind. When, therefore, the unfortunate sufferer thought fit to recover, Mr. Cary lost no time in return- ing tc his original accusation. "Whether you intentionally alarmed my child or not, I wish you to distinctly understand, that she must not b 3 disturbed again. Bleside, Mrs. Cary is not ac- customed to having any one in her kitchen or dining- room, and would prefer you would sit in your own room. "  I,     THE EBONY IDOL.       14t Caesar here broke in with a groan or two, and an evident inclination to renew lis distortions. "And furthermore, Cesar, if you remain in our house, you must share in the labor of the household. My salary is very small, and as you perceive, we all share in the burdens of the family. I wish to do for you all that I can do wisely, and as a Christian, but I can- not distress my family to serve you, or squander the small means at-my command. I would like you to work in the garden, cut my wood, and do such errands and chores as will assist my wife. It seems to me you cannot but be willing to do this." Caesar sat dog-eyed and sullen, without even pre- tending to listen. Mr. Cary spoke more warmly. "I shall make inquiry for you that you may obtain employment in some reliable family, where you can be paid for your labor; as scon as such an opening is found, I shall expect you will leave us willingly " "Dis nigger didn't come norf to work, no how; get work enuf at de souf ;" cried Caesar indignantly. "But you must work or starve; liberty is nothing, unless you can be clothed ard fed." "Dis chile got clothed and fed at the souf, and wan't twitted of it nudder," growled Caesar. "Lor', wish you could eat one of Dinah's hoe-cakes, dem's fixins as is fixins!"  "And let me add, Cesar, that for your own sake \   ^  '-     <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6440-00000077"/> "8       THE -EBONY IDOL.  more than mine, you must give up this profane use of  holy names, ' Swear not at all.'"  "Lor' Gor 'Mighty! dis nigger nebber swear in all he born days. Hope to drop down dead dis blessed minit if I ebber--"                  I "Caesar," cried Mr. Cary, despairingly, "is it possi- ble you do not understand that the words you have just repeated are used profanely? 'Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in win.' You have a precious soul to be saved or lost, and how can you take the sacred name of your final Judge upon your lips so lightly?"  'lBoff!" snorted Coesar: with. an evident disrelish  of the subject. 'I beg you, Caesar, now that Providence has re-  leased you from slavery-"  ' Providence hadn't nurthin to do about it; it was jus' dem cussed abolitioners, and dat is fact, Massa  i Cary." Mr. Cary groaned. It was evident he had indeed  fallen upon fallow ground. "Caesar, all gifts are from God! He has doubtless some motive in releasing you from a cruel task-master."  "Nebber heard any nigger, black or white, call my ole massa cruel task-massa afore. He was a gemman as is a gemman." "Why did yol1 leave hini, then?" asked Mr. Cary a little testily.    THE EBONY IDOL.       149l "Oh, Lor only knows, coz I was seduced I spect, Sambo he heard as how dat pussens up norf didn't work only when dey had mind; now dis chile nebber had a mind, and so I was seduced." "Well, Caesar, as I was saying, you are now a free man, and as you will have to act for yourself, you must learn to think for yourself, too. Your advancement at the North will depend upon your good behavior. You must be civil and respectful in your manners; you must not swear, and you must labor, whether you wish to or not, for if you are idle, you will fall into bad habits that will ruin you; beside, as I said before, you must be clothed and fed, and endeavor to become a blessing to the community." As the listener remained silent, the good clergyman, warmed in his zeal, and launched forth in an eloquent  dissertation upon the blessings of liberty, and closed by a most fervent religious exhortation, beneath which Caesar groaned and squirme&amp; out his impatience in vain. When in the path of duty, Mr. Cary was not to be sur- passed in persistency, and if CGesar was not awakened to a due sense of his depravity it was certainly from no omission in the exhortation. A little while after Caesar's dismissal from the study, Lucy came runninghreathlessly in, protesting that she had seen her grandfather's seal in the negro's hand. This seal was a curious antique, much valued by the clergyman, and kept upon his study table as a curi- e    <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6440-00000078"/> 150       THE EBON IDOL. osity, and very dear remembrancer of his lost parent. A glance at the table showed it to be missing from its accustomed place, and the clergyman darted after his daughter with more alacrity than he had been known to exercise in his life. CGsar was standing by the shed, as Mr. Cary coming up, demanded the seal. "Nebber see no seal, Mhatsomebber.  Hope to drop down dead dis blessed minute if I did. Hope massa Gary wouldn't tink dat a collered pussen of veracity would go fur to be stealin' when mass' Gary was a talkin' to him about he sins.

Return it to me; I promise you to excuse the theft."  But Caesar was injured innocence itself, and he "spec;ed it was all fur to destroy his character " that the accusation was got up.  The quick eyes of the child had all the while been following the movements of Csesarand noticing a little spot of freshly dug sand bh his feet, with a child's intuitive fondness for digging, she commenced excavat- ing a sand cellar. Not half a dozen handfuls had  - I   "       ,   THE EBONY DOL.       151 been tossed out, when a cry of delight burst from Lucy's lips. The seal had been uncovered. The malicious glance that darted upon the child from the negro's eyes was not unnoticed by the father. He took her with him to the study, and sat down to cogitate upon the delights of personal experience in redeeming the slave. His home, which two weeks before had been an Eden of domestic felicity, was converted into a Pandora's box of evil. His own quiet of soul and body was at an end; his wife was fretted beyond that amiable woman's powers of endurance. Lucy was victimized, until she scarcely bore a semblance of her former self, and all this was endured fcr the good of one, who seemed not to be capable of one sensation of gratitude in return. Was he in the path of duty? that was the question. Here was his hobby, beautifully illustrated. There were three millions more to be christianized. Mr. Gary grew faint in thinking of it. The clergyman took his hat, and after suggesting to his wife the propriety of watching Caesar, and espe- cially of keeping Lucy under her own eye, he sallied forth on a round of parochial visits, vowing inwardly, that he would not return un-il he had disposed of his sable guest.    <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6440-00000079"/> CHAPTER XVI. "From the dejected state in which he is, He hopes by you his fortux es yet may flourish." PERICLES, PnINCE OF TYRE. MR. GARY called upon Deacon A and Deacon B and Deacon C, but although the families were full of in- quiries about the past history and "capacities " of the negro, not one of them could be persuaded to take him home. Mrs. A. protested she could never eat a mouth- ful of food with. such a repulsive face at the table. Mrs. B thoiught her children" would be frightened into fits," and Deacon C frankly owned that, although he was glad the man had escaped, he did not feel called upon to support him, though he said he had no objection to giving him " fifty cents or so!" Very despairingly Mr. cary turned toward Miss Dickey. David was hoeing in the garden ag the cler- gyman came up, and seeing him advance, struck his hoe into the ground, pulled off his blue overalls, seized the hoe handle with both halds, leaping over At with a "summerset" which brought him to the gate! ? I   THE EBONY IDOL.       153 "Fie, David," cried the clergyman, " are you never to leave off these buffooneries?" "Why, you see, sir," cried David, opening the gate with his profoundest bow, " my head is heavy and my. heels light, and so my feet are always getting over my head." "I do. not know what should make your head so heavy, David.      , "Oh, if I had died young, it would have been known, sir." Mr. Cary, who was too familiar with the fooleries of the " blasted "David to heed his utterance, acknowl- edged a reference to "Amalgamation Sermons," with an impatient wave of the hanc, and was soon oblivious of it in the gratification arising from Miss Dickey's very cordial reception. The conversation naturally glided toward Caesar's advent. ',Miss Dickey was positive he must have de- scended from a very distinguished personage by that name, whose head she had frequently seen upon medal- lions. The relationship, she thought, must be " quite distant," but still she fancied she could not be mistaken in the resemblance! The brows in the one case were always encircled with a laurel wreath, which gave per- haps a more classic contour to the head ; still there was certainly a " family likeness." Mr. Cary thought it possible, but not probable. He 7*      *        '     a  !,7.     <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6440-00000080"/> 154       THE EBONY IDOL. was no physiologist, however, and was willing to abide by the fair orphan's decision. Miss Dickey replied that her greatest delight was in clambering up genealogical trees, and when she came across a distinguished stranger, she could not rest until she had investigated his relationship. The desperate Mr. Cary caught at the idea. "Perhaps, Miss Dickey, you would like to have Caesar as a guest for, a few days. We do not wish to be selfish, and mo- nopolize him at the expense of our neigh- bors'." Miss Dickey w agrqiD blushed. x Really," she Isaid, "she had thought of inviting him, but 'being an orphan, and having no one to shield her \-i\K' from temptation and ed. "He sawnoob- The authentic Portrait of C=sar as he Appeared jection," he said; to Miss Dickey.   THE EBONY IDOL.       155 "David was usually with her. Beside, he saw no rea- son why she should deprive herself of acquaintances or social pleasures, so innocent of 'themselves, through fear of comment." David, who had been listening silently to the con- versation, directly caught glimpses of fun in the ascend- ant, and urged the invitation with unusual zeal. "Now, aunt Julia, do for once be a little more inde- pendent! What a splendid chance it would be! Who knows but what he is the prince royal of some island! at any rate," he added, with an expressive leer toward the clergyman, "you would find in him a 'kindred spirit.'" The fair Julia still questioned the propriety. "If any thing should happen," she said. "Beside, it had always been her motto, that young ladies should be ' above suspicion! '" Mr. Cary encouraged, and David avowed his will- ingness to watch over her by day and by night, until the orphan's sensitiveness gradually melted away, and David was allowed to return with Mr. Cary for the purpose of bringing him. As Miss Dickey had not encountered Caesar since the day of the "reception," -ipon which occasion she adorned him with her muse and roses, she felt her virgin heart fluttering with pleasing expectation as the mo- ments flew by.  She twined the cork-screw ringlets afresh, and decked the little parlor with flowers, placed *         ,  ,  ;    <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6440-00000081"/> 156        THE EBONY IDOL. her Album conspicuously upon the table, and went out, into the garden to await the Arrival. When David return d, bearing himself the little bundle that contained Caesars " earthly all," he found his orphan aunt pensively reclining beneath an arch of Morning Glories, with a volume of the "Children of the Abbey "in her hand, and her small gray eyes raised sentimentally toward the western horizon. The little start of surprise with which she received them was charmingly natural, and the twilight passed very sentimentally in the garden, 'where the orphan, leaning upon the arm of her dusky friend, invited him to "meander."  And thus easily was Caesar settled in a new home. Hdfwas now in high clover! The attentions of the fair Julia were delicate and unceasing; while David plied him with flatteries, and encouraged him in all possible absurdity. The discovery that Caesar could not read was bitter but inevitable; David pronounced it "scandalous ;" nor did he rest until, having brushed the dust from an ancient Webster's spelling book in the attic, Miss Dickey had taken it upon herself to instruct Caesar in the art of letters. It was the most affecting sight in the world, David said, to see thyat friendless orphan sitting upon the door step, under the clematis vine, giving that "young idea" the customary lesson in orthographical gunnery. Coe- s        E   THE EBONY IDOL.       157 sar's progress was not encouraging, but the faithful Julia persevered assiduously.  Nor were the efforts of the fair Julia confined simply to Coesar's intellectual advancement. She bestirred herself in the Carean African's Friend Society for the replenishing of his wardrobe, and Cesar rejoiced in a new suit of, clothes, a great deal of coarse and badly made linen, to say nothing of sentimental keepsakes of wrought bookmarks, Chinese slippers, and whimsical pincushions! He was Miss Dickey's constant com- panion, and not unfrequently when the virtuous Julia issued from the homestead leaning upon the arm of Cmsar, he would mentally excl im,-  "Lor' Gor 'Mighty! how dem yaller gals would roll dar eyes wid bustin'. enby, if dey could see dis chile jes' dis 'ticular p'int!" It is scarcely wonderful if Coesar began to regard the " plantation" as being witfin his reach. His arro- gance grew also, and the mercurial David himself began in a' little while to weary of the insolence which the negro thought proper to assune toward him. So earnestly, however, did the fair orphan "live up" to some of her beliefs, that it is not possible to say where her amalgamation would have ended, if an ap-* parently trifling circumstance had not given a sudden turn to affairs, aid brought into conflict the several predilections of her maiden life, forcing a premature choice between them. \            SE      t t           **    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6440-00000082"/> 158       'THE EBONY IDOL. David had a fancy fori dabbling in Bome simple chemical elements, and had on one occasion tried the effect of a preparation of phosphorus upon the fair sur- face of Csesar's face and hands, and that to the no small terror of Caesar himself. Subsequently, anxious to dispossess the colored worthy of the idea that he had bewitched him, David attempted one day, as soon as darkness rendered his experiments visible, to explain the nature and effects of phosphorus, and closed his lecture' with the very gratifying trick of bathing his face, hands and hair with the phosphorated oil, and giv- ing chase to poor Caesar, who, being frightened out of his few remaining senses, flew from him as if he had been beleaguered by demons; David groping after him .with his fiery clutches waving to and fro, all the while throw- ing off sparks and stars of what seemed to the super- stitious pupil to be the genuine blue flames of the hot- test of places. Poor Caesar, like the righteous Lot, staid not to look behind him, but rushing hither and thither, finally turned toward the house to seek the common refuge of his sleeping room; when, as his evil genius would have it, Lord Mortimer, with the propensity that all house- hold pets possess of getting directly under foot, was taking his evening siesta! upon the warm flag of the door sill. Lord Mortimer, belonging to that unfortu- nate class of animated clay which always awakens in bad humor, besides having from the first become CAe-   159 THE EBONY DOL.       159 sar's most formidable enemy, and possessed naturally of the canine instinct to follow that which seems to fly, immediately sprang to his feet, and snapping wit fierce ivories upon the intruder's "long-tailed blue," raised the most hideous signal of alarm. Caesar gave the four-footed Lord a blow upon the head; that, however, only changed the attack from the long-tailed blue to its owner's almost equally long hee ; and Caesar in this new agony lifted up his voice and relled to the utmost ca- pacity of his lungs.            ' Now as it happened, the amiable Julia, attracted by the first noise, had arrived upon the scene just ii season to see the blow fall upon the regal caput of heri adored Mortimer. She was attacked in her tenderest point, and rushed fiercely forward, with what purpose perhaps she scarcely knew; but Coesar, hurt and desperate from terror, assumed the worst, and fled headlong into his chamber, and locking his door, ove between the sheets as the surest place of refuge from such accumulated, persecutions! "But where can weary mar find rest?" where, in- deed, when not even here was our sable hero allowed to repose in peace! The miserable Euphemia, a cat destitute of a single redeeming virtue, had the intolerable propensity, in common with other pet cats, of depositing herself upon all sorts of comfortable beddings.

Like Lord Mortimer, she had-been aristocratically inclined, bristling up her fur and spitting out her venom at Caesar's appearance And now, when her ladyship was dreaming of gallantries and feline triumphs, to be unceremoniously aroused by the weight of a frightened Sambo was beyond the forbearance of all cats, to say nothing of this particular Euphemia! Without waiting to parley, Miss Euphemia therefore planted her. malicious claws upon the only available portion of the intruder's person, and seizing his nose between her teeth, proceeded to test its elasticity by a process that for a moment made Caesar suspend his breath in any thing but admiration. The sweat of mor- tal fear was upon Caesar, and catching Mademoi elle's body with a grasp that suddenly caused the relinjuish- ment of her hold, he dashed her beautiful head com- pletely flat with one blow -against the bedpost. Tile one yell of the shattered ijuphemia was not ut- tere in vain! The auricular sensitiveness of a maiden lady when the interests of her pets a e concerned is not to be sur- passed! Calling David to her aid, the two immediately went to the rescue, and Casar was called upon to rise, stand, and deliver, which hb absolutely refused to do in language which we do not care to repeat.

Cassar himself was not a whit less bloody than his enemy, and as David glanced from one to the other, and became sensible to the elegant etchings Euphemia had left upon the ebony visagel the scene was so inde- scribably ludicrous that poor'Daivid, regardless of C- sar's wounds, and of the void this violent death would create in his aunt's breast, sent up such a peal of mer- riment tat Julia again rushed to the sanguinary scene! But, ala! no sooner had her gray eyes rested upon the  hapless Euphemia, all starkand gory, than "Down fell the lovely damsel   1 All like a slaughtered lamb 1" David chivalrously received the drooping figure, and speedily recalled her to consciousness by rehearsing the causes of Euphemia's untimely end! The scene of mutual recrimination that followed defies descrip- tion. The orphan was borne to her room in hysterics, while Caesar cursed the hour of his '" seduction," and heaped anathemas upon all the' conductors of under- groundc railroads!

The day following, the body of Euphemia was de- posited beneath a favorite rose tree, and Caesar was given to understand that his days of favor were num- b red. David, when he discovered that his merriment was at an end, and being well aware of the sarcasm already attached to his aunt's attentions to Coesar, understood the propriety of having his transfer appear to be'the result of accident..- He went therefore to suggest to Mr. IIobbs the propriety of receiving him as a laborer upon his farm. The idea being an economical one was suSficiently agreeable, ant David returned to announce the transfer to the sable guest. The parting between Julia and Caesar was more im- pressive than tender. "He tank his Lor' Go-' 'Mighty dat he shake de dus' ob dat cussed housen off his feet;" while she, with more dignified contempt, suspiciously watched his part- ing movements, as if expecting to lose half of her worldly gear. It was afterwards surmised that several missing articles had been appropriated by him as keep- sakes, but as Julia had her own reasons for silence, she faithfully kept his secret.   I CHAPTER XVII. "It is a basilisk unto mine eye- Kills me to look on't.--CYMBELINE. M. and Mrs. Hobbs received our hero with very little ceremony, and with coarse good nature. He was at once ordered to the field as a matter of course, where day after day he labored side by side with the master of the house, mingling freely with the family, sitting at their table, and sharing the chit-chat of the sitting- room, where the family congregated when the duties of the day were over. He was considered their equal, and treated as such. Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs, as we have said, had from the first espoused Mr. Cary's amalgama- tion theories with the utmost sincerity. They believed the negro to be their equal, physically and mentally. They had no fastidious refinements to be shocked by his peculiarities, and he was as agreeable a companion to them as if he had been of their own kith and kin. But there was a third member of this family, to whom Coesar's arrival was a precursor of evil, and this was no other than- the pretty Mary, of whose sweet 2    <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6440-00000085"/> 164       TEHE BONY IDOL.         I face the reader has already caught glimpses as he has followed the lights and shadows of Minden life. Mary Hobbs, as she xas always called, was not the child of the coarse couple with whom she lived, and whose name she bore. They had no children, and after a manner not uncommon in their line of life had adopt- ed from a neighboring ch ritable institution-partly to supply the natural want they felt, and partly to act as la little servant-this girl, nd with them she had grown up from childhood, the sweetest wild flower that fate ever cast upon the bosom of charity. Of the manner of her advent to the "Poor Farm," or whose child she was, they knew nothing, and cared quite as little. With all her external grace and delicacy, this icharm- ing waif inherited that e quisite love of the beautiful, and innate shrinking from contact with all forms of re- pulsiveness, which almost tlways is the natural endow- ment of such frail and plnsive sweetness of form and face. She loathed the very atmosphere that Coesar br athed, and shrank froil him as she would from the in ction of a pestilence. The food upon the table be- came unpalatable in his pr sence, and she shrank away from the seat which was allotted her by his side, until the jeers and taunts, and astly the commands of her foster-parents obliged her to resume it. His daily civilities, so long as they were confined to exchanges of such little atentions as naturally arise in   THE EBONY IDOL.       165 domestic intercourse, were endured because they were necessary; but when Cmesar's familiarity ripened into admiration, and he dared to cast his eyes upon her as one whom he might regard as a companion, poor Mary grew almost frantic in her intolerance, and loathed him with an intensity that fairly inspired her fragile person. It would seem impossible that her foster-parents should remain impassive to her complaints, or reject the poor child's pleadings to be delivered from a pres- ence so obnoxious to her. But as Mrs. Hobbs found the sable guest sufficiently congenial to meet her own approval, and having through the utter want of svm- pathy between them, finally come to consider the poor girl as a burdensome comfort, tolerated because she could not now be gotten rid of, she had at first regarded the child's likes or dislikes with entire indifference; and as Csesar grew almost importunate, and Mary, after pleading in vain for an intercession her parents declined to give her, took it upon herself to repulse and avoid him upon every occasion, in the Lost emphatic manner, both by her behavior and language, Mrs. Hobbs be- came irritated by this assumption of daring to act with- out her sanction, joined with Csesar, and there were two parties in this household upon this very peculiar matter. Mr. Hobbs, although a trifle more cultivated than his wife, was yet incapable of seeing any impropriety in the association of these two. As for love, it was an    <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6440-00000086"/> 1C6       THE EBONY IDOL. obsolete notion; he did not fancy it existed out of nov- els. He had married Mrs. Hobbs because she made good butter and cheese, and was evidently of an economical turn; but had another made butter and -heese better than Mrs. Hobbs, he would most certainly have preferred that other. Caesar, he said, was a gc od worker; he accomplished more labor in a day than he did himself, and that was a compliment he would bestow upon few. The man ,was well enough for aught he saw, and there was no economical consideration to induce him to keep Mary at home. Beside, Mr. Hobbs had all his life been thirst- ing for office; it was his hobby, an honor for which he had angled day and nigh;, and which seemed to be floting almost within his rsach. He was the abolition aspirant for the laurels of second representativeship  Nothing, he fancied, would so' ingratiate him into the favor of his party, as this signal exposition of his principles! Had Mary been his own daughter, he would have sacrificed her upon this altar of his ambi- tior.. His wife had al: he life fancied that to be the wife of a representative Was the embodiment of all earthly aggrandizement. They had labored with one heart and mind for the realization of this eclat, and now, when the hopes of party spirit seemed concentrat- ing upon Mr. Iobbs as the most zealous exponent of the abolition platform, and the bubble was within his   \   TTHE EBONY IDOL.       167 grasp, every energy was concentrated upon the attain- ment of the prize. Week after week poor Mary s;ruggled with the un- natural persecution, until her cheek grew pale, and her eyes sunken with weeping. She had never mingled very freely with other families of the village, partly be- cause Mrs. Hobbs herself was not much sought after by her neighbors, partly because she had always been a kind of domestic drudge in the family in which she was adopted, and also because she was so sensitive and shy, and found so little congeniality in the less morbid temperaments of the village maidens, that she preferred the exclusiveness that left her free to enjoy her own emotions without comment.  When, therefore, Mary found herself unhappy, and greatly needing some reli- able friend whose counsels might be of service in extri- cating Ifer from her dilemma, she. I ecame painfully con- scious that possibly not a single being in Minden cared sufficiently for her happiness to interest themselves in her trials. She hardly knew why, but she could not bring herself to speak of her troubles to Frank Stan- ton. The attentions of Coesar anI the persecutions of her foster-parents almost degraded her in her own eyes, and she dreaded lest Stanton would loathe her too, when her name was associated with Caesar's. Then, too, their intercourse had been so limited, his attentions so delicately bestowed, and so reservedly received upon her part, that she felt it impossible to give him her con- 9            .

H-er heart warmed more naturally towards our old acquaint mce, "Nannie," than to any ot er; but she knew that she could only escape from her present embarrassme ts by flying from her foster- parents' roof, and her confidence in Nannie would be virtually asking her to become responsible for her fu- ture home. There was a fondness, too, in her heart, for the only parents she had ever known; it was her nature to love every thing with which she came in con- tact that was in the least lovable, and she could not think of a final separation from her childhood's home with indifference. A thousand objections presented themselves to the mind of the young girl whenever she became restive under her grievances, until she resumed her birdens again, trusting to time and chance to relieve her of COesar's importunities. It was during one of these despairing moodsthlat she had stolen away from the home drudgery,:to solace herself with the solitary indulgence of her own sad thoughts. Close by the river side was a shaded nook, sacred to her from the earliest hour of her remem- brance, and thither she strolled for the indulgence of her sorrows. To her surprise the haunt was preoccupied, and that too by no other than Frank Stanton himself, evidently absorbed in the perusal of a letter which lay open be- fore him. Mary turned quickly aside, but her step, J    THE' EBONY IDOL.       169 light as it was, had betrayed Ler; Stanton sprang to his feet. "Excuse me, Miss Mary," ie said, detaining her, "I am so glad you have come; I was going myself to see you, to bid you good-bye,' he added, sadlyl as he saw her unwillingness to remain. The little word fell like a knell upon her ear, and she instinctively repeated it, as her blue eyes sought his face inquiringly. "Yes, Mary, I am going home; my father has sent for me, and his orders are peremptory." The color faded slowly from the young girl's cheek, and the long lashes drooped lower and lower over the tell-tale eyes that she durst not raise to his face. ' There was a long and embarrassing silence. "You can have little to regret in leaving our quiet country, Mr. Stanton; but your friends will be sorry to give you up." And you, Mary? Is this little acquaintance all' we shall ever see of each other?" It was said sadly, as if the thought were painful to the speaker. Overbur- dened as her poor heart was with its concealed bitter- ness, it is no wonder that she felt the hot tears rushing to her relief. The long lashes drooped lower still, while ' she shaded her face from his earnest gaze. "Shall you never return here again?-never? ' she , asked at last, tremulously.  Unfortunately her downcast eyes did not read in the 8    <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6440-00000088"/> *170 .THE EBONY IDOL. handsome face before her, the great struggle for self- command that was visible there. She heard only the reply:that fell from his lips,with what seemed to her longing heart a cold and urimpassioned voice. "I cannot tell, Mary; perhaps not until those I have known and loveL here are changed or lost to me forever." Sad as was the tone with which these words were uttered, there was a reservedness about them that sent" a chill to her sensitive heart, and the innate pride of her sex was aroused. "Let me hope, then, you 'may be successful ,and happy, Mr. Stanton, in the future, and let me bid you good-bye." She extended her hand in her old quiet, smiling way. Frank took it between both of his, pressed it reverentially to his lips; anc almost before he was aware of her intention, she hal glided away. He called her passionately by name, for a moment pursuing her, but she only fled from him the faster, until, irritated with himself and her, he saw her disap- pear within the old farm house. It was well that. the interview had so ended, and Stanton said so -o himself as he lay despair- ingly upon the green turf, and hid his quivering face in' his hands. lFor, after al, what had he, with such family surroundings as his, to hope from a sickly at- tachmiient to this frail Northern flower, which his father   THE EBONY IDOL.      171 would bid him trample under his feet as unworthy a throb of his heart? Besides, his life was but just opening upon the ambitious career his father had mark- ed out for him; and he understood his own wayward moods sufficiently well to know that his impressible na- ture might be decoyed from its allegiance to the pensive Mary, long before he would pe at liberty to espouse her. Indeed, he knew that even did his own heart re- main faithful to her, it was a union his parents would never sanction, and he must cling to the one with the loss of family and fortune. To what purpose, then, should he seek to disturb the, even tenor of her young life? Ought he, for his own selfish gratification, to seek her for a more tender part- ing, which might deceive her with false hopes, although it could not deceive her in regard to the real tenderness of his own heart True, he left her to struggle with an existence,which to him appeared a thousand times worse than death, inasmuch as her home was so bleak and drear that her own loveliness seemed utterly mis- placed. But then it was the only home she had ever known, and with which she had always seemedsatis- fied ; she would always-live on as she had lived, until some more fortunate lover should transplant her to bloom upon his own breast; and after all, impossible as the thought then seemed, Mary might live and die more happily than if she had become his bride. And so, hour after hour, Stanton lay upon the green ,     <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6440-00000089"/> 172       THE EBONY IDOL. grass, his face still buried in his hLands, struggling to reconcile his heart to his judgment, and disciplining his affection to sacrifice itself to the interest of its idol! It was a noble, unselfish heart that could thus struggle in silence, when the object of its intense passion could be had for the asking. He knew that,\ and yet not for a lifetime of bliss woLld he have brought one pang to her heart. His face was whiter than the clouds above him when he arose from the place upon which, like Jacob, he had " wrestled and prevailed." "Oh, Mary!" he cried, as he lingered upon the spot where they parted; "how many, many times your feet will rest upon this sod, and yet no voice will arise from it to bear w'tness to the purity of a love that can thus sacrifice you!! He extended his arms passionately toward the old farm-house, as if yearning for a final embrace; flung them wildly aloft as if invoking the blessing of heaven upon his idol; and the next morning, before the village was astir, Frank Stanton was homeward bound. f \ .  -         -    CHAPTER XVIII. "Abashed she blushed, and with disorder spoke."-Paiom. IT was late in the afternoon of the following day, that Mary, as she leaned moodily against one of the tall stiff poplars that adorned her home, saw Squire Bryan. approaching, with t-ie evident intention of addressing her. Her first impulse was to avoid him; her second, to sink upon the wooden bench, from which she had arisen, and pressing her hands nervously to- gether, await his wishes. Squire Bryan threw himself by her side, and his crutch at her feet. "I am rather old to be mfde a-medium for romantic young men, but Stanton went off in such a hurry, Miss Mary, he said he had not time to do his errand himself. - He wished me to take over some volunies of poems which he thought you might like to keep as remembrancers of olden times, and some other knick- nacks which he fancied might not be unacceptable. Take witness, therefore, that I have faithfully fulfilled 9.    <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6440-00000090"/> 174       TIlE EBONY IDOL. the mission." And the Squire relieved his pockets of sundry packages, without once glancing towards her. Indeed, he seemed absorbed in examining the five tall poplars, that rose so prim and stiff before the farm- house, and which'he protested looked like five old maid going to churchwith their hymn books in their hands. c; r. Stanton is gore, then " asked Mary, after the first emotion had subsided. "I was not aware he was to go so soon." T 2'e Squire finished whistling Yankee Doodle before he thought proper to answer. "Frank, gone . Yes, he was off this morning by the first coach." And here Squire Bryan sighed as if half of his heart had gone with him. "iNannie and I have been roaming from one room to another all day. I do not see just now how we are to get along without, him." "He is not to return, then?" Mary asked, faintly. "No; I had a letter from his father about the same time with Frank's summons. The old gentleman has got some matrimonial notion into his head, and has recalled Frank to marry him off to some rich fairy, that has dazzled his own eyes. So I suppose the law is not to be thought of again." Here the Squire resumed his whistling. The poor girl's cheek paled and crimsoned, and crimsoned and paled, and then her face settled: into a   THE EBONY I OL.       175 cold stony pallor most frightful o look upon, and all the while Squire Bryan went on whistling, without one glance of pity. "Mr. Stanton was acquai ted with his father's wishes, I suppose," Mary said, in a low, husky voice, after a long silence. "Oh, yes, of course. Frank knows that whenever he does marry he must marry a rich beauty, and one of family, otherwise his father wi 1 cut him off without a shilling.

By the way, I hear Ceesar has proved to have a very suscepti le heart, after all," and Squire Bryan glanced roguishly toward the young girl.

Are you faint Shall I get you a glass of water?" he c ied, as Iary continued to shake her head without spea ing.  "Go in, then-go in, child-don't sit ip the draught under these poplars; " and the Squire placing his hand kindly upon her arm, assisted her to rise; and leading her to the door, bade her take care of herself, and retired. Mary tottered to her chamber like a sick child, and throwing herself helplessly upoa her knees by the bed- .g    <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6440-00000091"/> 176       THE EBONY IDOL. side, kind nature came to her relief, and mercifully shrouded her- into momentary forgetfulness. It was here Mrs. Iobbs found her, when, having called in vain, she had gone in pursuit of her. "Yo 'hussy you, why don't you come when I call you  'Tis a pretty time, to be on your knees, when the fire is to be kindled for supper, and you are always wanted. Get up, I say!" and she pulled the girl sav- agely by the arm. "Luddy Massy! Luddy Massy " cried the woman, as she became conscious of Mary's insensibility. "Mr. Hobbs! 'M-i-s-t-e-r' Ho.-b-bs! C-se-s-a-r!" she screamed, wringing her hands in un- feigned alarm. "For Massy's sake come up here this minit! Mary is as dead as a rit! And Mrs. IIobbs set up a boo-hooing that would have been "illegant" at a wake. The two men thus touchingly appealed to, came trundling up stairs, but when they had arrived were equally ignorant of what should be done, but stood in the remotest corner of the room, gazing in blank dis- may upon the beautiful form kneeling there all uncon- scious of wrong'and suffering!  "ow cal-um she looks!" sobbed Mrs. Hobbs, wip- ing her eyes upon the corner of her apron! "Clam as de angels of hebben!": whimpered Caesar, rolling up his eyes, and drawing his finger across his upper lip with an accompanyingsniff, while I I "! i   THE EBONY IDOL.       1" Mr. Hobbs plunging both hands into his pantaloons pockets stared at her in open-mo'lthed wonder. It was only when Mary began to show signs of re- turning animation, that the three bestirred themselves to action. Mrs. Hobbs stifled her with camphor, while Caesar scorched feathers by the aid of lucifer matches. Mr. Hobbs, who had vainly ransacked the house for a palm-leaf fan, returned with the leathern bellows in- stead, and like a true son of Vulcan blew with such pre- cision and effect that poor Mary, after an ineffectual struggle to breathe, relapsed into a second and longer swoon, which so frightened the well-meaning execu- tionersthat they suspended their efforts and Caesar was despatched for our kind physician, Dr. Baker, whose benevolent countenance beamed upon Mary's awaken- ing. The poor girl returned to hlr old domestic ways, more patient and long-suffering than before, not even shrinking from the attentions of Caesar, or growing impatient over the selfish exactions of her parents. And yet a painful metamorphosis was going on in the young girl's nature. She became more self-reliant, less timid, and mingled more freely with her acquaintances. The repose and dignity of soulwhich in all noble natures springs up from the ashes of despair, came to the support of the hopeless Mary. She became con- scious that the fearful alliance that ier foster-parents were assuming for her, could and should be avoided; 8*    <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6440-00000092"/> 178       THE EBONY IDOL. and many a sleepless night the poor child lay tossing upon her bed, forming scheme after scheme, only to be abandoned as imprac-icable. It was during one of these night-watches, tlat the image of David Dickey presented itself. His mild good nature and ready wit had been often brought to her rescue, and from her earliest childhood he had been a kind of guardian spirit coming to her relief, ever the hard sums and copies in her school tasks. She knew at once that if human agency could lift her out of her peril, it would be found in the brawny arms and hearty good will of her old schoolfellow, and her heart leaped with impatience to appeal to him. Some days elapsed before the oppor- tunity presented itself, when tying on her chip hat, she wended her way to Miss Dickey's residence. As she passed the village cemetery, she saw the object of her pursuit leaning thoughtfully upon the stone wall, seemingly absorbed in contemplating the resting- place of the' dead, nor was he conscious of her approach until he felt the soft touch of her hand upon his arm. "Providence is prop'tious to-day, David, for I came out on purpose to seek you, to give you my confidence," she added, smiling, "and to ask for your aid." The young man gazed at her inquiringly, and with a strange flushing of his sunburnt face, and motioned for her to sit down besid3 him. "No, let us go in," said Mary, opening the wooden \l   THE EBONY IDOL.      179 gate; and, seeking out an old stone beneath the shade of the wall, the two sat down. "You must be my confidant, David, but you must promise not to betray me." A little dimness of dissatisfaction passed over David's face. * "If you think me capable of betraying you, you 1  would do better not to confide in me." "David!" cried Mary, reproachfully, " do not quar- rel with me upon the onset. I am too miserable to bear even a jest," and the poor girl burst into tears. David knew it was no common grief that could so disturb the quiet-hearted Mary. Ia   "Don't weep, Mary; you know me of old to be  light of tongue. If I can serve you, speak out freely, p and it shall be done." ;w Mary ceased weeping, and sat with her blue eyes gazing wistfully into his. ' "David, do you know any place in the country where I could probably find a situation to do house- -work or sewing? any thing, indeed, where I could re- main unknown and support myself " The young man gazed at her as if he half suspected her sanity. "Do you mean -hat you wish to go out to service " he asked, in surprise. "Yes," she said, firmly. "I wish to do any thing that an honest person can do, to be independent. I knew you had been a good deal away, and thought it t         ,   "     <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6440-00000093"/> 180 180  T  THE EBONY IDOL. more probable you co ld aid me to a place-than any other. I wish to go immediately, and without any one's knowledge."  David hesitated. What could tempt Mary to wish to leave her parents, and how could so delicate a being hope to be able to supply her most common needs by the labor of her hands I He longed to know, and yet durst not question her. "I could certainly ind you a situation with very little effort, but I beg you will first be certain that it is for your interest to leaYe home." A painful suspicion flitted through David's brain, that her flight had some connection with Frank Stan- ton's, departure. And yet he manfully rejected the implied insult to the poor girl's confidence. "If you would trust me with your reasons for this strange movement, perhaps we could bring about your wishes without exposing you to all this hardship." Mary's face flushed crimson, as her eye fell beneath his earnest gaze. Strangely enough she divined the very thought that was passing in David's brain. "David," she said, speaking out firmly, like one who is conscious of her own integrity, "I will tell you the whole truth. They wish to marry me to The devil they do  crie David, springng to his The devil they do!' cried David, springing to his feet as if a shock of elecricity propelled him; and he stood before her with cliched hands and set teeth, glar-   THE EBONY IDOL.      181 ing into her face, as if the monstrosity were not to be believed. Mary laughed hysterically, as she gazed It him panting out his indignation. "Do you wonder; I wish to go to service now?" "Is it possible you can be serious, Mary? In the name of Heaven, who could have originated so beastly a design?" Mary laughed again, more nervously than before. "'I believe I am going crazed, David, with this long struggle;" and she gave way again to mingled tears and laughter. When the two became more calm, and David became familiar with the novel Idea, his quick perception discovered at a glance the causes that were operating against her. "It is a great pity Coesar did not marry my aunt Julia," cried he, indignantly. "If nothing but amalga- mation will suit them, they ought at least to consult the wishes of the bride, and - know that6 Barcus was willing.'" There was another outhreak of laughing, and as Mary looked into David's happy face, she felt all her burdens vanish. "Well, we must get rid of COesar. Do you stay where you are, and remain passive in their hands-it will be best so, as opposition will only increase their rancor. Trust to me, I never was outwitted yet. And    <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6440-00000094"/> 182       THE EBONY IDOL. do not fret so, Mary," he said, looking anxiously into her thin face, " you never shall lack a friend so long as my name is David Di key! Whether. you see me or  not, you may rest assured that I am watching over your safety, and when you see your deliverance at hand, you will know I am near."  Mary thanked him again and' again, and went home happier than she had come. David, after, watching her slight figure receding ia-the distance, re-entered the gate, and sat down upon the seat she had vacated, plucking at the long grass, and twining the green blades around his fingers. Hlw unlike he seemed, in his sombre reverie, to the thoughtless, giddy-brained nephew of Julia Dicker! He was living over again the sunny remembrances of the old school-house, where he had sat during the cold winter hours, mindful of little else but the pale, sweet face bending over the desk in the corner, whose eyed intuitively turned toward his when the lesson grew burdensome, stealthily holding up the perplexing sum, or slipping across -o him the copy-book to which her unaccustomed pen refused to do justice! How he had laden his pockets at his aunt Julia's cupboards, in order that he might surprise her with hidden offerings when she peeped into her desk of a morning! How he had lingered behind his school- fellows to say kind words to her, when she went home apart from the village misses! How valiantly he had defended her rights upon the playground, and knocked o    THE EBONY IDOL.       183 down the " largest boy " for darirg to insult her! How he had ransacked the old newspapers, and almanacs, and Readers for tit-bits of adoring poetry, which he copied! with the nicest care, and slipped into her hand, or placed between the leaves of her spelling-book! Did he not know, too, every flower that little Mary Hobbs loved? And did he not bring her to see every bird's nest and new brood of aunt Julia's menagerie? In fact, was there any thing that really existed for David, which he considered independent of its connection with Mary's happiness! Then, too, what happy blissful 'hours they had spent under the old sand hill, scooping out mysterious cavities, and nanming them after all sorts of romantic horribles gleaned firom their story-books! What bakeries they had instituted, piling up their scalloped tins, and patting their mimic pies and cakes into a perfection unknown beyond the precincts of small- clothes! AhI childhood-childhood th blessedest thing That nature ever invented I And so David went on, plucking the long grasses, and dreaming over his boyhood, until with a long- drawn sigh he cast both grass and memory aside, and passing his rough hand over his sunburnt face, like one dizzy with his awakening-he paused a moment, and went his way.    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6440-00000095"/> CHAPTER    XI'X.

Those of her own sex who should have pitied and counselled better things, ridiculed and abused her, while old men and young men congregated upon the piazza of Glynn's Hotelfor no other ostensible purpose but to talk over and compare opinions upon this ridic- ulous engagement! Their perplexity increased with the frequency of the congregating, until nothing re- mained to be done but to plunge their arms to the el- bows in their pockets, and magnanimously await the result!  The pretty Mary gradually became sensible to the ridicule attached to her position; at first she smiled, and entreated their forkearance with her mute, appeal- ing eyes, trusting that no one could believe her so des- titute of all self-respect. But as murmur after niurmur reached her, and she felt that her few friends shrank from her as something too debased for common courtesy,  \  Y   THE EBONY IDOL.       185 she threw herself at the feet of her foster-parents, and begged them to do her justice. "If you must disgrace and torture me," she cried, "make the people conscious that I am the victim, and not the designer!" "A pretty time of day when sich as you talk to them as has sheltered you ever since your own parents left you, Luddy knows where, about torterin' you!" cried Mrs. Hobbs, tossing her head scornfully; "didn't I and Mr. Hobbs take you from the 'sylum where you come a beggarly outcast, that nobody else would take in! and didn't we go for to clothe, for to feed and for to treat you like our own child, when nobody else would go for to' clothe and for to feed you! Says I to Mr. Hobbs, says I that morning, What's best to do with that ar young un'? Says he to me, says he, I s'pose we must do sumthin'! Says I to him, says I, Perhaps she might grow up to be a great help to us, and her keepin' can't cost us much, no how we can fix it! I reckon she would be mighty handy to drive in the geese and hens, and do little chores like. Mr. Hobbs, he stopped and scratched his head a minit, and then says he to me, says he, If you can keep her from squalling night and day, I don't care what you do with her; and so I and Mr. Hobbs took you in! and a nastier little brat no-  body ever see, I guess!

"What I should have been without you, Heaven only knows," cried Mary; "but if my condition could have been worse than it is, then God pity me!" If Mrs. Hobbs' unclassic nostrils had represented the Northern Pole, and the anger which actually flashed froij that amiable lady's countenance the electric phe- nomenon known as the Northern Lights, the pen of a thousand travellers had been vainly worn to the stump, in attempting to delineate the magnificence of the co- ruscations! Poor Mary cowered before the ominous silence, for she knew but too well that the good dame, like her mother earth, grew intensely breathless while the earth- quake within her breast gathered strength and fury! Nor was the young girl mistaken! Vesuvius never vomited forth &amp; more wonderful exhibition of embow- elled malignity, than came hissing from her foul lips upon the defenceless girl. No epithet was too low, no accusation too absurd, no taunt too gross to escape her, and Mary's crimson face bent like the young sap- ling low before the storm it could not defy! The pasqion of Mrs. Hobbs had just perfected itself in one grand climax of a1use, when the brass knocker, suspended upon the front door of -Mr. Hobbs' farm- ,\   THEE EBONY I OL.      187 house, announced that the Rev. Mr. Cary was seeking admission to this lamb of his flock. No sooner was the pastor's voice heard in the hall,  than with a denunciatory shake of her clenched fist 7.' and an emphatic warning to Mary to "hold her  tongue," the lady of the house turned with many smiles' and the blandest of faces to receive her visitor. Mary availed herself of the opportunity to escape from her presence, and indulge in the only luxury the poor child had ever known, that of tears! Gliding from one topic to another, Mr. Cary soon approached the one most occupying his thoughts. "The rumors of the village do not often reach me, Mrs. -Hobbs, but I am told upon good authority that your daughter Mary is encouraging the addresses of CGesar." Mrs. Hobbs affected a little siirk of intelligence. "Every dog must have his day, you know, Mr. Cary." "Do I 'understand you to mean that the report is well founded?" asked Mr. Cary, with great surprise in his tone and manner. "Well, murder will out; I s'r ose we must lose Mary sooner or later," and Mrs. Hobbs went on smirking and knitting.  Nothing could surpass the blank astonishment visi- ble in Mr. Cary's face. He did not endeavor to express ,    <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6440-00000097"/> 188       'EE EBONY IDOL. his emotions, but he did what he was in the habit of doing when language failed him-he whistled! "I and Mr. Hol'bs thought rayther queer on't al first, but there's no Eccountin' for the fancy of gals, and as I and Mr. Hobbs don't wish to blight Mary, we have given our consent." Mr. Cary continued to whistle. "I 'spect you'll have the privilege of jining or 'em ;"Mrs. Hobbs went on smirking more and more. "I guess we shall have the weddin' in the. meetin housen, so to let folks see that we consider all mer 'free and equal;' for my part, I had jest as lief Mary would marry a nigger as to marry any body else, and ] hold to folks livin' u6) to their profession, any how! "Really," said Mr. Cary, rubbing his hand slowly up and down over ,he nap of his broadcloth, "this is the most singular er-gagement I ever heard of! Mary is so young and inexperienced, that she probably does not realize the step she is about to 'take; of course you are the best judge of what would promote her happi ness, but if her fate cannot be averted, it at least should not be hastened by her friends; she should have time to consider, and Cesar should be removed from hei presence. It. is a very singular instance of infatuation -vdry-singular-irdeed!"and Mr. Cary resumed his whistling!  Mrs. Hobbs' knitting-needles flew fast and furious; K,            \   THE EBONY IDOL.       189 the wedding must precede the election, and the election was fluttering in the breeze of the New Year! I "I don't think it does any good to oppose gals; when I and Mr. Hobbs was a-courtin', every word that was said agin him only made me stick the closer. I kinder reckoned you would be mighty tickled up with the match, Mr. Cary." Mr. Cary's surprise was renewed. "Thought I would be pleased with such an alliance, Mrs. Hobbs? It seems to me the very reverse of being desirable. I do not object to Caesar's color-to the fact that he is a negro-that I know of; but he is tery un- cultivated, and is not a person ir any respect to whom a young girl of Mary's delicate temperament could safely intrust her happiness. I would rather preach her funeral sermon than seal her as'his wife." Mrs. Hobbs' kitting work fell from her hands as she fixed her eyes upon him full of amazenent, the least bit tinged with indignation.  "Well neow, if I don't gin it up!

It was easy to see explanations would but increase the misunder- standing, aid Mr. Ca:y, after due reflection, interested himself in the success of her dairy. But Mrs. Hobbs was not so easily pacified, and the clergyman saw the propriety of beating a timely retreat. As he was passing the gate he observed Mary shrink- ing timidly behind a clump of lilacs, and stopped to address her. The girl came forth reluctantly, and it   THE EBONY IDOL.       191 was evident from her inflamed features that her tears had been freshly flowing. There was something, too, so- forlorn and utterly dejected in her drooping figure and pale face, that the good man's heart smo e him, and he took her hand tenderly in his, and gazed silently and inquiringly into her tearful eyes.         J  "My dear child," he said, sym] athetically, " answer me truly, is it of your own free wiL that you encourage the rumored attentions of this man Caesar? The en- gagement is so publicly spoken of -,hat I cannot offend you, I am sure, by asking." Mary struggled to withdraw her hand, and her slight figure expanded with hauteur, as she said, scornfully, And if I do, Mr. Cary, I am but living out the theories you have been laboring to inculcate!" Mr. Cary sighed, but firmly retained her small hand in his, "Answer me, Mary-yes or no "  The little touch of pride had vanished-the re- proaclful sigh was rightly interpreted, and the, poor girl bowed her fair head upon her pastor's hand, and gave way to an hysterical outhreak of tears and 1 gh- ter. "'Tis so absurd," she said at last, when she could trust her voice, "to have you ask me such a question -you who have known me all my Life. How could I tolerate such a " Am O    <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6440-00000099"/> 192       THE EBONY IDOL.  Mary paused, while a shiver of disgust ran through her whole frame. '"Who, then, has originated this repulsive report? your mother even encourages it, and your father also!" "I speak for myself, Mr. Cary; so fa- as I am per- sonally concerned, I deny all that you may have heard! My name is to be coupled with no person living, and I am sorry that my past life should not have refuted this scandal without the necessity of a denial." "Am I to understand, then, that this engagement has been encouraged by your foster-paren-s contrary to your wishes "  "You are to understand nothing from me, Mr. Cary, more than I have already said; aid I beg you will not question me further ;" and the girl again strug- gled to withdraw her hand. The clergyman dropped it reluctantly. "I should be very glad,Mary, to serve you in any manner you could suggest, and so would my wife; you would be heartily welcome at our house as long as you chose to remain there," he added, significantly; "you may rely upon it, you have friends who will never see you sacrificed." Mary raised her blue eyes with a quick flash of gratitude, but beyond a simple "Thank Yrou, sir," she remained silent. The clergyman lingered as if unwillirg to depart, and yet uncertain what to say, when hearing the shrill   THE EBONY IDOL.       193 voice of Mrs. Hobbs from within, h3 invoked the bless- ing of Heaven upon the poor child and turned away. "'What on arth are you and the minister talkin' about all of this time, Moll?" asked Mrs. Hobbs, sus- piciously, appearing at the door; hey? what was it, hussy?" "I thought clergymen always talked about religion," answered the girl, evasively.  "It's mighty strange ministers never can talk to young gals wittput gettin' hold of their hands! They can talk to old women fast enough without going across the room, but when a gal is in the case they work her over just like a lump of butter. They take her hand in their'n, and squeeze it, and pat it, and change it from one hand to the other, and squeeze it and pat it agin, and hang on for dear life like a dog to a bone ; but they wouldn't touch an old woman's hand no more than if it was pisin!"  "I suppose they used to work ycurs over, mother," Mary said, a little maliciously.  "In course they did, and a despirit pretty hand I had, too-fat as butter, and as full of dimples as cher- ries are of stones," and Mrs. Hobbs extended two re- markably large, red and calloused palms for Mary's ad- miration. The least perceptible flitting of a smile played around the girl's lips, but she was silent, and turned away just in season to avoid David, who at this moment 9    <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6440-00000100"/> 194       TaE EBONY IDOL. came through the jgate. One glance of David's quick eye took in the different moods of the mother and child, but nothing daunted, he attacked the matron upon a point where most housewives are vulnerable, and which he was well aware would soon bring the good dame to surrender at discretion.  "Mrs. Hobbs, I told aunt Julia to-day that she hadn't had any thing fit to eat in the house for a month, and I was just going over to Mrs. Hobbs' to tea, and have some of her doughnuts." "Wall, I haint got naryJ doughnut to-night, so now you know!" "Of course you haven't, but that is no reason we can't fry some," said David, selecting a soft place upon the grass, and relieving himself of three " som- ersets;" "I came over on purpose in season to beat the, eggs." "' The fire is all out, and I aint a-going to make up no more fire to-night for nobody!" "Of course you aint; but I am, and I am going to make it up for Mrs. Hobbs, and Mrs. Hobbs and I are going to fry some doughnuts, and after we have tea, I have got something to say to Mrs. Hobbs in secret, and to nobody else but Mrs. Hobbs; so here goes!" and David turned six more somersaults, coming down plump upon a box of prickly p3ars, the sole house plant of the domain. "Snooky!"cried the irate Madam, boxing his ears   THE EBONY IDOL.      195 with her broad palm, "you are the crookedest stick, David, that ever an old maid, brought up." "No twitting,' Mrs.! it isn't everybody that can bring up children as you can! bu; if you want me to tell you what I've got to tell you, I advise you to hurry up those doughnuts." Mrs. Hobbs was evidently relenting. "You are the peskiest critter to come round a crit- ter, David, I ever did see. Go and make the fire, and then run outt 4 the barn and hunt up some eggs; I s'pose I may as well make 'em fus- as last." Away went David upon his commission. I've got it all cut and dried, Mary-only let me get the old lady alone, and Coesar is done for!" Mrs. Hobbs was cajoled into good humor. The doughnuts were, as David sentimentally declared, " all his fancy painted them," and when after tea David with great gallantry escorted Mrs. Hobbs into the par- lor, the amiable lady sat smoothing her apron, the pink of smiling expectancy.         i "Now, Mrs. Hobbs, I've got a plan into iry head that I think will make our fortunes, and enable us to bring ourselves before the people-favorably, you un- derstand; I mean in regard to Mr. Hobbs' election.

David hitched his chair a little closer, and dropped his voice into a confi ential undertone. "Now you see wlat we want is to make the people understand that you go in for the platform! We want to make them under tand that you regard all men as free and equal!" Mrs. Hobbs winked approvingly., "Now, I thought that we might get up a lecture, giving an outline of Caesar's life and sufferings, and have him go round nd deliver it. You see, after he had got through his experience,' he could manage to throw in some little compliments in regard to Mr. Hobbs' and your treatment of him, and it would go a tremendous ways in electioneering. In fact there's no end, to what he might do in that line, if it was well managed. I thought I would speak to you about it, and if you approved of the plan, I would get up a lec- ture and go round with him, and see that he did it up brown. We would haee an entrance fee of course, and as there hasn't been any negro lecturing up this way, it would go off with a rush. Why, it would be a fortune to us all; the money would make a grand outfit for the wedding, and we will have it all out in print: "'Maried, at the bride's father's, Mr. Hobbs, second representative of Minden, Miss Mary Hobbs and Cae- sar, the late very distinguished colored gentleman, ex- dI IJ   THE EBONY ID L.       197 tensivqly known as an impressive nd eloquent lecturer!

"He don't pretend he ever did, that I know of; but when he saw how the crowd enjoyed his experiences, it was natural he should make them as wonderful as he could.

"Well, David, I do not think I had better write that lecture; ,you can do it better than I could, and it might be brought up against me politically; but if there is any thing else I can do for you, I will aid you with pleasure."  David twirled his hat with some embarrassment. "I wish by and by, Squire, when the lecture is' about being announced, that you would contrive to get Mary Hobbs over here, and take care of her. Unless I am greatly mistaken she leads a sorry life over there, and if some things take place about that time that I think may happen, it would be safe to have Mary out  of harm's way." Squire Bryan looked keenly into David's face, but expressed no curiosity in, regard to what might happen. "Mary shall be here safe and sound, David." "Do you hear from Stanton, Squire?" asked Da- vid, after a long pause. "Oh, yes; Frank is laying siege to beauty and an heiress."

"Nannie, my love," said t e husband, taking her hand between both of his, " you are too much alone; I think so often, but business absorbs me, and I neglect you. I have a little plan now, however, that I think will meet with your approval. Suppose we adopt Mary Hobbs?" Nannie's face flushed half with pleasure and half with surprise. "But she is adopted, Horace. We could not think of taking her from her friends st this late period, when she is becoming a young lady, and will soon be settled in a home of her own." "Did it ever occur to you, annie, that an affection was springing up between Mary and Frank?" Nannie was silent a little. "I used to think of such a thing, Horace, when Frank was so fond of talking about her, but I do not think it ever would have amourted to any thing." "Oh, no-how could it?

Nannie pressed hi hand gratefully. ( I am quite cer ain that I should love dearly to have Mary with me. She is unlike all young girls I ever met--so delicat , kind, generous, and intelligent; she always seemed mnsplaced." "No doubt she is, and if, as it is said, Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs have endeavored to force this revolting marriage upon her, they have c rtainly sacrificed all claim to her upon the score of for er kindnesses."  "I never believed the report," said Nannie; "i it is true she went to chur h with Caesar, and wassaid to have allowed many freedoms from him, but all that might be for the purpos of keeping peacein the mily. Mrs. Hobbs is so vulg r herself she would never per- ceive the indelicacy of such intercourse. I dare say the marriage would sem proper enough to he, and it would be proper enougl if Mr. Hobbs was the bride " As for David, he was already bending over the first literary 'production he had ever seriously attempted, and he was surprised to find how little differenue there was, between thinking and writing out his story. He remembered once, when he had been walking with   THE EBONY IDOL.       205 .

Indeed, Frank more than o ce had spoken words of commendation that had settled down in o  David's heart, germinating for future harvest.

"Yes-siree, sir!" said David. "'If they an stand that, they had better be given over to hardness of heart!" Although Cesar so fully appreciated the intellectual beauties of his prospective lecture, he was by no means so enthusiastic in transferring the items to his own stu- pid brain. David's patience was sorely triedwhen he found Caesar falling asleep day after-day over his own sufferings, and growing suddenly oblivious where his tortures should have been keenest. Indeed, when left to his own recital, he mixed the whippings, and roast- ings, and starvations, up into such an unintelligible jar- gon, that David Well-nigh threw hisliterary-antling to the flames in disgust! But David bethought him of Csesar's favorite drink, which placing upon the table beside him, so stimulated our hero's exertions that after two weeks' drilling Coesar's lecture was announced as ready for delivery. All Minden was by this time in a high state of ex- pectancy. The public yrejudice,which had so severely passed judgment upon the love-passage in poor Mary's life, had slowly been turning in her favori It came to be rumored that Mary had received Cesar's attentions ,          t            THE EBONY IDOL.       209 from no other reason than through fear of her foster- parents, and that they were forcing this marriage upon her for the furtherance of political aspirations. The widowers and admiring young men were zealous in her defence, while that particular class designated by Saxe as the " very married men," muttered out their indignation more loudly in proportion as the square of distance increased between themtselves and their better- halves, and insinuated that tar and feathers was too good for so dastardly a schemer as Hobbs. There were loud threats of mobbing the lecturer, and of tearing down the church if it was opened for the occasion of the lecture! Mr. Cary was hung in effigy upon his own lightning-rod, whil1 the fair Miss Dickey was seated in her Reception robes by proxy upon the top of the liberty-pole! Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs were burnt at the stake in the full blaze of a bonfire of pine shavings, and Caesar himself was represented by a lay figure setting out in a literary career upon a spiked rail! Even the children formed themselves into parties, and pitched into each other in defence of the paternal platform, until bloody noses and blackened eyes were abundant, and every mamma could boast of her "youth with the open countenance!" Suddenly the excitement subsided. The church door was thrown wide open, and jammed to its ut- most capacity upon the occasion of the lecture.

Cmesar, whose personal estimation of himself was by no means diminished by his present position, ascended the rostrum with an air that would have eclipsed the most aspiring of qur youthful politicians! As Minden had not been initiated into the mysteries of " claquers," the sable orator was received " as might have been ex- pected." There was a wonderful shuffling of calf-skin boots, flabby slappings of bare hands, with groans and hisses in the background. Preliminaries over, Caesar, who had been drilled and stimulated into a tolerable re- tentiveness of his sufferings, rehearsed his history with a hesitation and naivete which, judging from the tears that were shed, melted the hearts of the audience; but the final flourish of rhetoric, where, turning to Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs, he poured forth his feelings, produced an effect entirely the reverse of that which the amiable couple had anticipated. Cries of "Shame! Shame!" burst from all sides of the house, mingled with most emphatic denunciations at the allusion to the intended union. Squire Bryan re- tired with Mary upon his arm, and the moment the door closed behind them, such a yell of execration went up as never was heard in Minden. Caesar, not exactly comprehending the tumult, and already intoxicated with the evening's success, being spurred on by the villainous David, who was prompting    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6440-00000109"/> 212       '  EBOY IDOL. him from behind, an urging him on to his destruction, thought proper to ii provise a few expressions upon his own responsibility!

THE good people of Minden were already yielding themselves to the sweeter influences of night, and Mrs. Hobbs was herself tying the strings of her cotton cap, when a knock at the outer door of her home attracted attention. "Wt h's there " asked the dame, raising the win- dow, and projecting her unattractive physiognomy for the intruder's admiration. "I wish to speak with Mr. Hobbs a minute; is he in'" "Wall, he won't be out, I reckon, this time o' night! Here-H-o-b-b-s-you t don't you hear you wanted."

"I wish to speak with you upon very urgent busi- ness. I am sorry to disturb you at this late hour, but it concerns your interests more than mine." The window closed, and after a little delay, Mr. Hobbs appeared at the door. "Have the kindness to step this way, as it is neces- sary to maintain the greatest secrecy." The unsophisticated aspirant for th6 second repre- sentativeship rounded the corner of the farm-house, and found himself surrounded by a group of disguised men, the leader of whom promptly advanced, and laying his hand upon our friend's shoulder, exclaimed, "Mr. Iobbs, you are our prisoner. The first sound that passes your lips will be the signal for violence; follow us quietly, and you are safe." Quaking with terror, Mr. Hobbs resigned himself to his captors, and the dark mass closing in upon him, he was escorted with military tread and the: ominous beat of a muffled drum to a retired nook by the river side, where the party falling upon the right and left, allowed the prisoner the range of the column. "Now, sir," demanded the leader, ' you will please to answer the questions put to you in a distinct voice." "Do you design to marry your adopted daughter, Mary Hobbs, to this negro, known by the name of Cae- sar?" "I have nothing to do about it," sniffled the pris- oner, "Mary is going to marry him herself."   THE EBONY IDOL.      215 "Do you approve of this marriage, and ha e you encouraged his attentions?" "Wall, I can't say but whaa I have," whvTied Hobbs. Sir, you can but be aware that this union is abhor- rent to every feeling of humanity! Had this young girl been your own daughter, you would have sacrificed your life before you would have seen her the wife of such a man! It is known to us -hat you designed to enforce this marriage,because you fancied it would pro- mote your political advancement! You would scrifice this helpless girl for your ambition, and because she had no natural protectors, you fan-ied your fellow-citi- zens would stand coldly by, while your design was con- summated. Behold your mistake, sir! You have been tried by a self-elected jury, both within and without your political party, and they have decided to cool your abolition fury in a manner that will not fail to do it ef- fectually. The remedy will now be put to the test! Gentlemen, do your duty!" Grim, and dark, and strn, the two men nearest the prisoner silently advanced, at whose approach Mr. Hobbs fell upon his knees, and roared lustily for pro- tection. "He had a right to do what he chose with a child, who had been a great trouble and expense to him!" ' Cries of "No! no!"

Very delib- erately his not numerous garments were removed, until the poor victim stood shivering in the night air, naked.

"For heaven's sake," screamed Hobbs, cutting a se- ries of pigeon's wings with an abandon that would have shamed the divine Ellsler," don't put me into the water this time of night. I have had the rheumatiz awful, and it will be the death of me, sartin. Dear gentlemen, for God's sake, don't!" Mr. Hobbs was lifted from his kneeling posture, and like Mahomet's coffin swayed between the heavens and earth, struggling and foaming like a hydrophobiac in his final agonies. It was but an instant, however- down went the practical amalgamist, and the water closed over him!

As if by magic a bright flame flashed out, revealing to the shivering Hobbs the preparations for a fate more to be dreaded than bathing by starlight. "The prisoner will please take his position by the fire, and answer the fallowing questions: "Do you now renounce your amalgamation theories for all coming time?"

There was no end to the "sym- pathy" manifested for the no longer insignificant Hobbs; but a cloud was stealing up from a direction little regarded, of which it becomes the historian's duty to make mention. In all communities, and we might say churches, there is to be found one or more unfortunate individuals    <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6440-00000119"/> - --sole d eligt av'l whose sole delight seems to consist in pecking at the weaknesses of their neighbors; digging up, searching out, and dragging before the world such little sins as seem to be the fruits of our " natural depravity," rather than to originate in any intention of evil. Deacon Curious was the bane of Minden. With what seemed to be the very best of intentions, he went about from morning until night sowing the seed of dis- cord throughout the, neighborhood. He "felt it to be his duty" to listen to all the village gossip, and retail it, because he seemed to hope to find some relief in get ting other people's opinion about it! iHe was exceed- ingly given to groaning when his friends' foibles were spoken of, and exclaiming in a very sepulchral tone, The Lord have mercy upon all sinners " The poor old deacon was a little deaf withal, and if there was any one word the misconstruction of which would entirely change the meaning of the sentence, the deacon s ears were sure to trip in hearing, and he would directly start upon his errand of mercy, and give no rest to the sole of his foot until every family had been edified with his groanings. Beside these qualifications for a nuisance, he had the happy knack of being exactly upon the spot where he wasn't wanted! If a brother or sister in the church yielded to but one weakness in their life, 'Deacon Curi- ous was just as certain to be upon the spot in season to Ret the worst view of it, as the sun was to set upon their v .    e   THE EBONY IDOL.      233 repentance. It was this rare talnt that sent the dea- con abroad ,upon the very unseasonable hour of the lynching, and brought him to le an ear-wilness to the soul-harrowing fact, that "Brother Hobbs was guilty of using profane language" upon that painful occasion. He had been returning from a charitable visit to a sick relative, and happened to come upon the party in the very act of immersing the victim. He had distinctly heard Brother Hobbs' say, " cuss 'em," and the old man's lips quivered with holy horror, when he  affirmed that he had also said " damn!" It was in vain Mr. Cary urgec the extremity of the occasion, and suggested that doubtless under th? excite- ment of the indignity; Brother Hchbs had been tempted to express himself in unusual terms, which he himself would condemn upon reflection. The good deacon could not be pacified; "his sou. was harrowed up for his brother," and nothing but a church meeting could give him relief. And so the brethren were r quested to assemble, and Deacon Curious was duly confronted with Brother Hobbs. The deacon groaned, and his brother confessed; but this trivial thing fired the train that ultimately rent the Minden church asunder! Deacon Curious was politically neutral, ro party being " good enough to receive his vote." B it unfor- tunately the church was political as well as religious, and amid this inflammable refuse of sin was concealed  7    .               ,     i    <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6440-00000120"/> 234       TTHE EBONY IDOL. the slow trail, that communicated the spark to the magazine. The brethren not in political fellowship with Broth- er Hobbs insisted that bathing by starlight was by no means a sufficient excuse for profanity, and that if he had not been in the habit of indulging in that sin se- cretly, he could not possibly twice have been thrown off his guard. Beside, he had" set an awful example before the sinners who were present, and thereby brought a reproach upon the cause he professed ;" and "therefore they moved that Brother Hobbs be sus- pended from communionship." Mr. Cary and his friends immediately uttered their protest, and a war of words was at once commenced, as memorable in Minden as the war of roses. Every thing that rancor, malice, and bitterness could, suggest, was.' hurled from one brother to the other, until it was very evident if "Bedlam had not broken loose," some- thing equally disastrous to good fellowship was abroad in the church. It was no longer the question of profanity that agi- tated the fold; it was which political party should carry its point!. One' member after another seceded, and in order to testify to their steadfastness, services were opened in a school-house, and after a few weeks the new church invited a young pastor from abroad to rule over them.

"Tie lifted up his voice like a pelican in the wilderness, and like the sparrow I upon the house-top, he uttered his moan!"  We drop the curtain over the shameless and unpar- donable recklessness of political religion. Would to heaven that Minden alone bore witness to the fatal folly of its clergy! that no other churches had been as ruth- lessly sacrificed to that conservatism, that sees no evil to combat at its own threshold,'and no souls worth sav- ing but those beyond the precincts to which they have been called to minister. All over the country the deserted churches are elo- quent with reproach, while from\afar comesoup the wail of despair from the scattered flocks, who have fallen into the pits their'own pastors have dug for their souls. To what, we ask, is this unwonted disregard for the Sab- bath, and this startling predisposition to infidelity at- tributable, which for the last few years has palsied re- ligious influence, and clogged the wheels of Christiani- ty? Why are backsliders from the true faith so nu- merous, and why is the Church hooted at by her former friends? We boldly answer, it is because the clergy have grown wanton in their abuse of the respect ac- corded to them as the vicegerents of God! They insult the audiences that go up to the high places for religious instructions, by forcing upon them  political rantings which they would not presume to ntter in the streets I j       .   THE EBONY IDOL.       237 Most recklessly have they cast the "-apple of discord" among their' people. Wickedly have they imputed their own self-will and tenacity of purpose to the im- pulses of God! We repudiate such blasphemy! A political priest is a social and moral evil, and the church can no more thrive under his influence than flowers be- neath the shade of the 'deadly upas. And what is to be the result of this strange fanat- icism? for, indeed, by what milder appellative can it be known?      ,  Cannot the clergy be made sensible that -,hey are placing the axe at the root of their own tree a that they are sapping forever that beautiful trust and confidence and love which the New England 'people have -re-emi- nently accorded to its-clergy In whom can we be- lieve, if the pastor that we have elected with 'thanks- giving, and sustained with our prayers, tramples upon our religious interests to gratify his personal proclivi- ties?

"Unaiming charms with rays resistless fall, And she who means no mischief does it all."-AARON HLL. MOST cheerfully do we turn aside from the dissen- sions and unseemly brawls,which have so fatally mar- red the serenity of our " happy valley," to follow the fortunes of our pleasant acquaintance, Frank Stanton, who had been summoned to his homefor the avowed purpose of seeking an alliance with the family of his father's eldest and firmest friend, Arnold. Mr. Arnold, who for the first time we here present to the reader, was a gentleman of the olden schcol, the tempting acres of whose plantation had many a long year stretched out beside those of the Hon. Mr. S anton, but which had been sadly neglected during many years of Mr. Arnold's absence from his estate. In years gone by, a dark cloud had settled around the home-hearth of the Arnolds. The youngest daugh- ter, a child of exquisite loveliness and promise, had mysteriously disappeared when abroad with its nurse    <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6440-00000123"/> *Ace  L novaX JLUJL,      -I  for the daily airing; she had been left upon the border of a creek during the temporary absence of the woman, who had gone, as she said, to pull for it some bunches of mistletoe, for which the child had clamored. At  first the nurse had concealed the little girl's absence, hoping, she said, to discover her; but when at length the alarm was given, the household pet had disappear- ed. When every endeavor to find the child had alike proved futile, the unhappy father had taken his droop- ing wife and sole surviving daughter to Cuba, where he had devoted himself to seeking oblivion and a for- tune. As is fiequently the case with persons Who have been many years exiled from the scenes of earlier asso- ciations, Mr. Arnold later in life awakened to a longing desire to return to his former home; to restore and beautify it, to bear hither his household goods, and an- nounced his determination to sleep in the home of his fathers. The early and half romantic friendship which had formerly existed between the neighbors was renewed, and from chess-playing and champagne, and the never- to-be-forgotten euchre, the father of the son and the father of the daughter glided into matrimonial specu- lations, and hit upon the happy project of uniting their children and their treasures.

"To all this, I most dutifully assented i Whereupon I was quietly informed that, having been fortunate \ enough to renew his intimacy with a friend of early life, whose daughter was the possessor of every virtue and accomplishment, he had already proposed for my ac- ceptance, and, he was happy to inform me, with entire success!

"Yours; &amp;c., "FRANK STANTON." Squire Bryan went home with Frank Stanton's let- ter in his pocket, the happiest of men; he found Nannie and Mary chatting in their usual quiet way in the cosy parlor. The husband threw himself upon the sofa, and placing his head upon Nannie's lap, gazed thoughtfully at Mary   THE EBONY IDOL.       247 through his half-shut eyes. Yes-she was very beautiful 9-very; the exceeding softness and purity of her child- like face, the long lashes that rose and fell so reluctantly over the bluest of laughing eyes, the poetical brow and finely arched eye-brows, classic nostrils, and tfat pecu- liarly chiselled lip, so exceedingly rare in the mould- ing of beauty! All these, with the rose-tinted com- plexion, and wealth of fair hair floating out in ringlets of most fantastic grace, gave to that exquisite face a mythical beauty, so often an inhabitant of the fairy realms of imagination! Then, too, how regally the head bore itself upon the white full throat! how gently the rounded shoulders sloped away to where the finely moulded arms became eloquent with the poesy of motion, and the whole per- son expanded in undulating beauty! The Squire watched her taper fingers coquetting with the embroidery, until, twining his own hanls in Nan- nie's, his fancy went wandering back to the days of his own 'courtship, and the hours his wife's white hands had woven meshes for his own fond heart. "A penny for your thoughts, Horace," cried the wife, releasing her hand from his warm clasp to stroke back the thinned locks which had gathered many a sil- ver thread since her fingers had first caressed them. "Well, I have something to tell you, lEttle wife- an agreeable surprise to us all: we are to have Frank Stanton back again."    <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6440-00000127"/> AA 1jDvl  IO 1 L.  Nannie gave a cry of delight; but Mary only bent lower over her embroidery, and her small hands shook like aspens. "But I thought Frank never was to return to his law, but go on wooing a fortune!" said the wife, when the first surprise was over. "Nevertheless his father suggests his return, and Frank has written to announce it. He is probably upon the road before this." Nannie was full of conjectures, anticipating all kinds of pleasant arrangements for the future; but Mary's needle flew faster and faster, and still the crimson deepened'upon her cheek. That night, when the young girl retired to her own room, what a world of undefinable bliss flooded her young heart, banishing slumber from her eyes, but bringing no weariness to her soul! She was to live, then, beneath the same roof with Stanton, and associate daily with the object which she had regarded as a deity worthy her purest worship: The last few months had given wondrous tone and delicacy of finish to the young girl's inner nature; she had found, in the refinements of her new home, the sub- stance for which she had so vainly sighed-that higher life, the longing after which had only mocked and em- bittered her former existence. The world was before her, tinted with the roseate coloring of a first and ear- lest passion.   '1J'tm .i4VlN X IJJUL. . At7 Formerly she had shrunk from Mr. Stanton,as un- worthy to receive the courtesies of a common acquaint- ance. The very atmosphere' of her rude home she felt must be repulsive to his cultivated tastes, and however unjustly, that repulsiveness must necessarily envelop her own person. The budding graces,which had con- cealed their promise when chilled by those sullen skies, opened in full luxuriance when nursed by the genial sunshine of affection, She was not herself indifferent to this mental meta- morphosis, nor to the exquisite loveliness which her mirror reflected, since she fet both to be the keys that should unlock the treasures she coveted. Something whispered to her believing heart that there was a mean- "ng in Stanton's return, which she alone rightly inter- preted. And so the days glided by,lwhile her new-born buoyancy of spirit imparted a flitting elasticity of mo- tion whenever she moved, nd warbled in the musical gushings that mocked the s ngsters of the skies, until Frank Stanton resumed his old position in the family, and looked the admiration he even then did not venture to speak.  The young man was evidently in many respects un- like the Frank Stanton we have known. There was an earnestness in his tone and manner, a sincerity of bear- ing unlike his former gay good-nature. Life had evi- dently become a reality to him, and he had armed him-  self to run the race manfully.

His step was firmer, and his eye beamed with a keen insight intothe present and future; he was quick to decide and energetic to act; and Squire Bryan was never weary of laying his hands in his old caressing way upon his shoulder, and uttering his praises with honest pride. No father could read his son's success with more self-congratulation'; and in- deed, although the yoke had never chafed the youthful shoulders that bore it, had not Frank been a child of his own discipline? Nannie, with equal pride, rejoiced in the growing graces of her own proteg, and notwithstanding she pronounced the attraction of the young couple a very foolish affair, was constantly engaged in a series of ma- noeuvrings that assumed its perfect propriety. "I am surprised," said Frank one day to Squire Bryan, when they were in confidential discourse in re-. gard to his future, "that Mrs. Bryan never alludes to the change in my pecuniary affairs." The Squire smiled, as, removing his segar, he press- ed out the fire, and laid the stump carefully aside- "Well, the truth is, she does not know any thing about it." Frank gazed in surprise; "But I expected, nay, wished her to be in my confidence." ' Possibly; but I thought better of it. These wo- men are always talking over things among themselves, * ' ':*'. '       '     i   THE EBONY IDOL.       251 and I think, for the present, the matter had better rest between you and me." Frank was silent, as if from thought. "And Mary," he asked at length, " does she still suppose me carrying out my father's matrimonial views?" "I cannot say; she certainly has no authority from me-to think otherwise." Frank whistled a favorite refrain, and fidgeted a little in his study chair.  "I do not think she had better remain inder that impression," the young man said, seriously; "I would rather she should know of my father's displeasure." ' "And why?" asked his Mentor, turning his keen eye suddenly upon him; " what is Mary's opinion to you, or yours to Mary? A quick deep flush passed over the young man's face, as he wheeled directly in front of his malicious friend. "Much, sir. As much as Nannie's could have been to you, or yours to Nannie." "Right, my boy;" and the Squire extended a hand, which the other clasped in silence, while botL seemed struggling to keep down their emotion. "I feel almost certain that this unnatural estrange- ment between father and son will not long continue," the Squire went on, "unless some new irritation keeps it alive.

"No" he answered; what you advise is the voice of prudence, perhaps, but not the prompting of love like mine. The experience of the' last few months convinces me, that my fate is centred here. I will never deserve my father's anger, but you may be sure I shall never be unmanned by it. I will pursue the right, with 'Heart within, and God o'er head!'

My harvest has never been so golden as your father's, but 't will suffice for you and me'if fortune frown upon your hon- est effort." The kind Mentor's voice grew husky, and Frank, grasping his hand anew, bent over it with a heart too full for utterance. Worthy of each other were the spirits that mingled in that sacred embrace! The evening shadows stole inover1 and around the dusty old office, but still the two men sat planning for the future, and building up beautiful air castles whicl they decked with the gorgeous drapery of hope. The young heart leaped forward, panting for future contest, while the old grew youthful and earnest beneath 1the magnet- ism of that noble spirit. Later in the evening, Frank Stanton told his story at Nannie's home-hearth. It was surprising what an exhilarating effect his bad fortunes produced in the little circle. Nannie joined in the adoption with a sincerity equal to her husband's, while Mary's long lashes droop- ed lower and lower, until the soft cheek sunk into the sheltering palm, which vainly endeavored to conceal the tell-tale blushes. Still later, the curious moon came peering in at the \           "    <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6440-00000130"/> 254 254      THE EBONY IDOL. window.

He recently returned; -and some casual words dropped by this nurse having given rise to the belief that she had at least a suspicion, never before spoken, of the fate of tie child, caused her to be very closely questioned, and revealed the fact that she believed the child to have been stolen in a spirit of wickedness and 'revenge by a very bad negro fellow then in my posses- sion; and by him sold or otherwise disposed of to a company of vagrants that had been for some time pre- viously in the neighborhood.

STANTON: ( DEAR SIR :-I have traced a fugitive answering your description to the town of Minden, in the State of ------. "We had, perhaps, better concert personally the course to be followed, as under ordinary circumstances I doubt the possibility of capturing the negro; for if my information is correct, the people of the neighbor- hood are devoted to him.

"Very sincerely and truly, etc., "ABRAHAM CUTTER." Not a moment was to be lost. Mr. Arnold and Mr. Stanton immediately started northward upon tke pa- rental pilgrimage. The journey was prosecuted with little delay until within a day's journey of Minden, when they found themselves compelled to await the early coach in a little village so exceedingly destitute of attraction that the delay seemed doubly vexatious. Eager and restless, our travellers wandered out in quest of adventure, when seeing the villagers flocking r *      <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6440-00000132"/> 258        THE EBONY IDOL. towards the church, they joined the crowd and went in, supposing the services to be of a religious character. Judge, therefore, of their. suprise, when with the easy assurance of a speaker cdnscious of being well received by the audience, Csesar strutted along the aisle, alid rolled his eyes complacently over the multitude. Le- spite the changes time and circumstances had wrought in his appearance, the elder Stanton recognized in the evening orator no less a personage than the distinguished individual of whom they were in pursuit, and who, as the reader already knows, tho' the lawyer did not, was upon a lecturing tour. Uncertain of the best method of procedure, our trav- ellers incautiously exchanged sentences, which were immediately understood by the curious listeners near them, and it was directly rumored through the house that strangers were present for the express purpose of kidnapping the lecturer  Our travellers, all unconscious of the storm gather- ing around them, sat absorbed in their own specula- tions, until the unusual excitement among the crowd attracted their attention, and they became conscious that all eyes were suspiciously turned upon themselves. The lecturer in the meanwhile silently disappeared, and our travellers, thinking it wise to do the same, took their hats and were quietly passing out, when they were confronted by an officious little man with a jack- knife in one hand and a roll of " pig-tail" in the other,   THE EBONY IDOL.      259 who desired to be informed who they were and why they were present? Our travellers replied that they were citizens of the United States, travelling upon their own private affairs, and requested the little man to allow them to pass out. The owner of the pig-tail and jack-knife demanded in a louder tone to be informed if they had not been conversing together in regard to the lecturer? Our travellers intimated very delicately that it was ione of the little man's business, and that if he had any business of his own it would be well for him to attend to it. Little gentleman was now in a state of tremendous excitement, and flourishing his knife and pig-tail right and left, commenced haranguing the crowd in the most violent manner, urging that the gentlemen shold be taken into custody until their intentions were known. The crowd closed in around our friends, an the clamor became so fearful that the travellers thought it advisable to suggest that, since they could not be treat- ed like gentlemen by gentlemen, a few of the most prominent citizens present should attend them to the hotel, where they would be happy to satisfy them of their honorable intentions. A few intelligent persons immediately urgel the adoption of this gentlemanly concession, as being the one most likely to do justice to the strangers; but their voices were soon drowned by the pig-tail clique, who    <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6440-00000133"/> 260       THE EBONY IDOL. cried aloud that the proposal was simply a stratagem for escape. The little gentleman, the throng having slowly moved out of the church, now mounted a convenient :fI1 'i:  /  elevation, and after having deposited a fresh quid in his left cheek, harangued something as follows: "Let us not be cheated out of our rights, gentle- men!

Little gentleman again smashes his hands together, and wiping his forehead with a red bandana, jumps up and re-commences: "Who talks of Christian forbearance when our lib- erty is in danger!"

In the crowd still around the church-porch, ladies were trying to get out-a few treating themselves to hysterics, while the children tramp after, treading upon their dresses, and crushing the old men's corns in the stam- pede. Groans, profanity, and cries of order, prevail, In the mean while the lights are extinguished, and when they are re-lighted our travellers had disappeared, and David Dickey appeared. "Gentlemen," hei said, "allow me to say your lec- turer is safe; and so far as he is concerned, this excite- ment is entirely uncalled for.

An 'hour after, nothing remained in or around ;he "House of God" to bear witness to the patriot- ism of the occasion but little puddles of tobacco- juice, and the indescrilable odor of the "sovereign people!" The peacefully inclined portion of the coimunity quietly retired to their homes; but the economical little patriot, who was so much more lavish of his e oquence than his ninepences, determined to air his patriotism at all hazards; and gathering a few ill-advised persons around him, proceeded valorously towards the hotel, to which Mr. Stanton and his friend had retired. The landlord informed' the crowd that the gentle- men, weary with travel, had retired for the night, and as he would- himself be responsible for the good beha- vior and peaceful intentions of his guests, he begged they would go quietly away, expressing himsel- willing to " treat all round" if they would kindly accede to his wishes.

The yells without were becoming savage and hideous, when our travellers appeared in the bar-room, and Mr. Stanton said, in a calm voice- "If this gentleman's house is to be besieged, and the night made hideous in this manner on our account, we are ready to meet these ruffians either peacefully or otherwise. Throw open your doors, and let us speak to the excited crowd; surely they must listen to reason." "For God's sake, gentlemen, retire at once," cried Squire Bemis; " you must be entirely ignorant of the persistency of our people, if you fancy they would be- lieve a word you should utter.

CHAPTER XXV. -  - He is about it, The doors are open.'-MACBETrH. "ATE in the day following a covered carriage stop- ped before the cottage-door of our friend Brya%, and Nannie fluttered hither and thither, as an elderly gen- tleman, burning with fever and wild with the strange fancies of swift-coming insanity, was borne into the cheerful guest-chamber, and tenderly placed between t e snowy linen of the luxurious "spare bed." It was the Hon. Mr. Stanton, upon whom the late excitements and exposures had had their effect. With the resolution of a strong will he had kept 'back the enemn, until he reached the shelter if his friend's roof, when as a child sinks into its mother's arms, he gave one pressure of recognition to the kind hand that clasped his own, and mental darkness envel- oped him. Long weeks of burning fever ensue dur- ing which the almost equally frantic son listened to the mournful ravings in which his own name was o con- I    <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6440-00000137"/> 268       THE EBONY IDOL. spicuously woven, and learned of all the parental ten- derness that still flooded the old man's heart. Night after night Frank kneeled by his bedside, praying for forgiveness for every pang his waywardness had inflicted; but the wild eyes turned wearily away, while the sufferer vainly prayed for his son! But there was one voice that never pleaded in vain-one hand that never was repulsed-one sweet face that always brought solace to the invalid-one step that his quick ear recognized before all others. The gentle Mary js  never approached him but with acceptance; his medi- cines were received from her hand; his hot brow grew cool beneath her caressings. However wayward his mood, the steady firmness of her blue eye quelled hi{ ravings, and he would listen to her sweet melodies until slumber wrapt him in blissful unconsciousness. In his delirium he fancied her to be his guardian angel, before whom the demons that tortured him shrank back abashed, nor dare approach her charmed presence. Like a wayward child he would amuse himself with twisting her long tresses over his fingers, and holding them in the rays of the sun, to catch their peculiar golden glimmer, which he imagined was the reflection, of the "Golden City" from which she had wandered. As ie became convalescent, his admiration rather increased than diminished; and when he discovered that this angelic being was the adopted daughter of his friends, his only surprise seemed to be that Frank never   THE EBONY IDOL.       269 should have even alluded to her wondrous loveliness. The hours of convalescence, usually so tedious to the impatient invalid, assumed a half-poetic tinge as the fine old gentleman re-opened his softened heart to the influences of his son's affection, and the thousgd and one kindnesses lavished upon him by his host and host- ess. Above all was he never weary of feeling the soft palm of " little Mary" upon his temples, and as she toyed with his white locks, and bent above hiib with the witchery of heart-light and heart-shade gleaming from her blue eyes, it was little wonder that he felt within his own heart an apology for the ad iration, which he was sometimes conscious flashed out uniidden over the handsome face of his son.  At times, too, it must be confessed a suspicion dart- ed through the father's brain, that something leeper and stronger' than a passing fancy might have allured poor Frank fromn the golden alliance with Edith. It was in vain that Frank resorted to a variety of stratagems, to draw from his father some unwary ex- pression,that might foreshadow his fate should he hon- orably confess his passion. Whether intentionally or otherwise, all such attempts were so completely baffled, that the son shrank from opening his heart to -he pa- rental investigation. The father, in the meanwhile, was undergoing a self- inflicted investigation, not a whit inferior to that with which his son honored him.

The struggle between pride and generosity was a severe one, but humarity conquered, and the' Honora- ble Mr. Stanton magnanimously resolved to humble himself and surprise his son. The day following this generous decision, when Squire Bryan came in as usual for an hour's political chatting, the conversation very unexpectedly took a sentimental turn, which the Squire was not long in per- ceiving was drifting towards his newly adopted daugh- ,ter.  t            y a    d a h Now the Squire was perfectly aware of Mr. Stan- ton's doubly-refined stilling for " family ;" he knew that one drop of pure aristocratic blood was of more value in his old friend's eyes than coffers of gold. But Squire Bryan was a Yarlkee, accustomed to see "Black, blue, and white Migle-e-inle-mingle," and we are sorry to say had little fellowship with Mr. Stanton's ideas. When, therefore, after a long pream- ble, in which the Honorable Mr. Stanton endeavored to reconcile his conscience with his condescension, and closed with an insinuation that he had decided not to oppose his son in any future alliance, the Squire mali-        . .    THE EBONY IDOL.       271 ciously enough determined to inflict a little righteous castigation upon the patronizing offender. "It is true," Mr. Stanton went on, "Mary is by no  means the wife I should have chosen for my son; but then as her family is unknown, we can at least suppose her to have been of gentle blood.?' "Oh, as for Mary," cried the Squire, carelessly, "her blood or origin has nothing to do in this case: Mary is engaged." The aristocratic Mr. Stanton sprang to his feet, not unmindful of the quiet humor in the lawyer's eyes. "Served me right," blurted out Stanton; " served me right," he cried, testily. "I should have remem- bqred my family, sir-my family. The very thought was madness, for which I stand rebuked!" The Squire sat silently puffing his segar, until his irate guest had resumed his equanimity. "Yes, sir, Mary is engaged, and very eligibly, too, sir. I assure you, the family is not a whit inferior to your own!" "Possible!" ejaculated the innocent invalid, paus- ing in his stampede to look his astonishment at the other family's condescension. "I shall never consent to Frank's marrying beneath hinm," he added with emiphasis. As he spoke, the door opened, and Mary glided in with a package of letters for the gentlemen. Her quick    <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6440-00000139"/> 272       T TH EBOY IDOL. ear caught the fatal sentence, and she felt that her fate was sealed.  i  A few days after this conversation, Mr. Stanton an- nounced his ability anid intention of returning home at once. His illness precluded all possibility of benefiting his friend Arnold in his search for his daughter, and  his prolonged absence rendered his presence upon the plantation imperative.! Frank dutifully prepared to accompany him, and the leave-takigs had already com- menced.  It was late in the evening previous to the intended departure, before the fmily circle broke. up, leaving Frank to take his farewell of poor Mary, and assure her whatever might betide, he would surely return to claim her as his own. J3ut Mary's heart sank chill within her. The delicateand intuitive perception of character with which she was endowed, had revealed to her the knowledge of the father's heart more fully than it had ever been known to the son himself. She fancied that she saw the sacrifice by which she must be won; nor was she insensible,that the wealth of her loving heart was a mere bubblewhen weighed with the evils spring- ing from parental displeasure. "Do not cling to me," she cried, with her tearful face upon his bosom; "I am worthless weed which the ocean has stranded at your feet, and which pity alone could have rendered attractive. Do,not embitter bie life of your father-do not'trample upon your own   THE EBONY IDOL.       273  terests.. You are stronger than I; speak but the word  at shall make you free!" "Not if that word would pave every step of my fu- re life with gold, my Mary!. What were riches with- t you to share them? What were honors, and you t by to exult in my success? My father loves you ready; let us trust to time to soften the foolish preju- ce of birth. Love such as ours is of divine origin; it rings from heaven, and to heaven it shall return!" And so, embracing and embraced, the sweet face ught something of her lover's hopeful gleaming, and she felt how utterly desolate the world would be to r, but for the sunlight of his smile, poor Mary believ-  , and was blest. That night the Stantons left for home. 12*    <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6440-00000140"/> CHAPTER XXVI. "Whither, lone wanderer-whither art thou flown? To what sequestered bower, or gloomy dell? Say, dost thou go where sorrow is unknown-- Where trouble never enters, dost thou dwell?"-C. LLOYD. AMONG the letters which Mary was taking to the gentlemen, at the moment the-cruel declaration of Mr. Stanton fell upon her ear, was the following: Mn. ARNOLD to the, HON. MR. STANTON:  "   MY DEAR FRIEND: "Congratulate me. After these long weeks of in- tense solicitude, a little cloud arises in the East, no big- ger than a man's hand, but yet indicative of success. I can scarcely restrain my impatience while I pen these lines to you, and I write because my companions must rest, since human nature is exhausted.

"This young man, who professed to be travelling with Caesar simply upon a kind of Yankee speculation, readily espoused my cause, and proved to be equally shrewd, persevering, and conversant with the class of people with whom we have to deal. ":The family into whose hands Cesar knew the child to have passed, was found after the most painful search but we were informed that, having no motive for keeping the little girl, they had given her to a wan- dering musician, who was travelling over the Middle States. So we advertised for the stroller, and succeed- ed in attracting his attention by promises that appealed to his self-interest. He answered from the western part of New York, and thither we hastened, only to be told that he had exchanged the girl with a beggar woman for a boy, thinking the transfer would be for their mu- tual interest. "Here we were in danger of losing every trace. We explored every haunt of known misery, and lavished money upon such of those unfortunate creatures as al- lured us with false hopes; but Heaven be praised, we     <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6440-00000141"/> 27 6   -   THE EBONY IDOL. stumbled upon the very object of our searchin an old farm-house where we had stopped for a glass of water. The young man David immediately recognized heras an old woman who had wandered from Dan to Beer- sheba, and who had every two or three years passed through his own village. The miserable creature's brains were so shattered, and her memory so treacher- ous, that it required all of David's tact to bring to re-  membrance the features of the wanderer. The poor  babe had passed through such a variety of fortunesthat it was impossible to d scribe her definitely. It was only when I mentioned the color of her hair, and shew- ed her the tress you have so often admired, that a glim- mering of the truth dawned upon her. "The child, she said, had been taken away by an- gels! She had lain down to sleep one day, beneath a tree in the open air, leaving the child to pull the wild roses that grew by the hedge, but when she awoke the little thing had disappeared, but she heard her voice high up in the air singing. "It was in vain we argued and entreated-nothing could convince the hag that the child could have been living, and had probably strayed away during her slum- ber. But the superstition had fortunately impressed the locality upon her memory, and it seemed that she had yearly made a pilgrimage thither, to 'dream be- neath the tree of angels,' as she called the spot of her strange experience.   THE EBONY IDOL.      2" "Accordingly we took the poor old creature with us, and proceeded upon our forlorn mission. We found the tree, beneath which she had erected a little monu- ment of stones, and then we commenced inqciries among the inhabitants for the lost child; but most of the families were of more recent date. Far back among the mountainswe found an old man who was regarded as a kind of seer-but of unclouded intellect. Yes, he said, he remembered many years ago a child had been discovered wandering in the woods, but it was s ch a pale little thing no one cared to be encumbered with it, and it was sent to the poor farm. "Believe me, my dear friend, when this heart-rend- ing recital fell from the old man's lips, every vestige of hope and manliness left me; I fell senseless upon the threshold. David bore me back to the rude inn, and watched over me with the tenderness and assiduity of woman; but repose was impossible, and we dragged ourselves to the poor farm, only to be told that even the locality of the farm had been changed, and the es- tablishment had passed through the hands of at least a dozen different tenants. We advertised, and sent run- ners in every direction. As yet we have learned noth- ing more definite. "David, who professes to be well acquainted with the country around us, thinks from the character of the New Englanders, and their universal kindness to such objects of charity, that if the woman's story was true, i  '    <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6440-00000142"/> 278  \    THE EBONY IDOL. we must be in the immediate vicinity of those, who can speak more definitely of the child. "Imagine the anxiety of a lfather's heart, who has  traced his poor child through wanderings like these!

"She cheers his gloom with streams of bursting light."--SoMA. THE excitement of the late partings had scarcely subsided in the cottage of the Bryans. Mary's sweet face still retained a shade of sadness, and her voice, always before gushing out into little snatches of delicious melodies, grew mlute as the harp upon the willows. The kind Nannie, seemingly unmindful of her way- ward moods, left her to the quiet indulgence of them, thinking, perhaps, that solitude was the surest remedy for regrets like hers. One day, in her wanderings, she had extended her rambles far away amid the romantic windings of a road, long since abandoned and grass-grown; until, wearily seating herself, she had garlanded her brow and person with the graceful-vines of the starry clematis, whose pale beauty seemed a fitting type of her own. As she twisted the tender stems, she warbled almost uncon-    <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6440-00000143"/> 280       THE EBONY IDOL. sciously an old air, that seemed never to have been learned, but rather to have gushed up unbidden from some hidden spring; so moss-grown that its existence had been forgotten. The notes stole forth clearer and sweeter, until the old forest took up the echo, and fai- ries seemed playfully flinging back the musical cadence of the songstress. The hoofs of horses approached softly, muffled by the untrampled verdure, and travellers paused to listen. "Surely I know that voice," cried David, eagerly. "Hush-hush-for God's sake, hush," cried Mr. Arnold, spurring his horse to David's side, and bring- ing it to a sudden stand still. "It is thirteen years since I have heard that air, and by heavens! if my daughter lives, she is here!" Was it strange that in all their wanderings in pui- suit of the poor waif, David had never once associated the thought of his foundling-playmate with the object of their search? And yet at that instant the veil fell from his eyes, and as if the heavens had flashed forth the mystery, he shouted back the wild cry, "' She is in- deed here!" Like a frightened fawn the young girl sprang from her covert of green, and stood before them in her fan- tastic array! What poesy of motion-what grace of attitude, mingled with that expression of surprise! The long shining tresses, upon which time had flung no, shadow, fell back from the uplifted face, revealing eyes s I               .,   THE EBONY IDOL.       281 whose strange beauty had never been erased from the father's heart.  With a loud cry of exultation Mr. Arnold sprang to the ground, but only to fall senseless at the maiden's feet. Little by little sensibility returned, and David, whose forethought seemed to encircle all around him, earnestly entreated Mary to retiie, . "Go horhe, Mary," he said; " say to Squire Bryan that we are wishing to see him upon business of impor- tance, and as soon as this gentleman is recovered, we will join you." Mary flew to the cottage, but scarcely had she an- nounced the approach of the stranger, when the trav- ellers themselves appeared in the distance. We will not dwell upon the scene or explanations that followed. One proof after another of the young girl's identity was established, in the absence of all of which, the wonderful resemblance of the young girl to the stranger must have proclaimed to the worldthe re- lation of father and child. How Mary swooned, and Nannie wept, and the Squire rubbed his hands with delight! While David, with a face whiter than the pale clematis flowers that still clung to Mary's tresses, stood in silent despair, as he beheld every vestige of his own air castles crumble at his feet!

"Such is life," soliloquized Mrs. Kimball; "the world is an immense water-wheel, always revolving. Very comfortable when you are up-intolerable when you are down!" Col. Johnson and his " inestimable lady " were among the very first to wait upon Mary, with their very distinguished congratulations! While Mrs. Hobbs gave vent to the fullness of her wonder in that old elegant exclamation, "Snooky!" As for Miss Dickey, this little episode in the found- ling's life only established the convictionthat " ungath- ered roses" were liable at any moment to " have some- thing happen to them;" and so far as we know, is still awaiting the coming of the bridegroom. Caesar still perambulates the country, spending his time between lecturing and lounging, but never allows himself to pass the domicil of the fair Juliawithout feeling the pressure of the iron horse-shoe upon his breast! Mr. Cary, after having effected the ruin of his church, accepted a "call " to a more thrifty vineyard, where, it is hoped, his former experience will be of ser- vice to him. \*        *  *   TIIE EBONY IDOL.      283 We are compelled to say that, since Csesar's brief reign in Minden, a kind of African drought has settled down upon the little village. The '"Monyment" of the Carean African Friend's Society became so shaken and rent by the dissensions of the sisterhood, that it fell into decay, and the places that once kniew it, now know it no more forever. The "War of Black and White Roses" is ended, and ebony has ceased to be tho hue par excellence,by which the standard of patriotism and Christianity is tried.  Indeed, the blood of a white man in Minden is now considered as valuable as the blood of a black! Of terrors and fraud they have had enough."  THE END.     </p>
