There is a neat little flower-garden in front, divided by a gravel walk ; and in this garden are four circles, edged with dwarf box. Every year these circles are newly planted with mignonette and candy-tuft, china-asters and ladies'-slippers, and many other flowering annuals, such as children love, and all of which, you, my young readers, if you live in the country, can call by name. It is some years since Abram, the old black gardener, reverenced by all the children in    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6495-00000006"/> '8-     THE GRAHAMS. Ashville for his skill in fancy gardening, first rounded and edged those flower-beds, and the little ones who hung around him, delighted to watch his progress, have all but one gone forth into the great wide world. Emily Graham, the youngest, still lives at the cottage with her widowed mother, and it is her careful hand which, every autumn, gathers the ripened seed to plant the garden anew in the distant spring. She calls the four little circles the "Brothers and Sis- ters," and takes much pleasure in arranging them according to her fancy. Frank's, Wil- lie's, Annie's, and Emily's! Such is the or- der in which they are planted (but one of them is planted weeping now); and every blossomn in Willie's circle is more precious to her than gold. Let us go back now to the time when the Grahams first came to Ashville, and learn something more about them.   THE G RAHAMS.        9 Captain Graham, their father, was an offi- cer in the United States service, as brave and noble-hearted a man as ever was reared in the army of the nation. His wife was a woman of uncommon refi#emlent and intelligence, possessing an amiable disposition, and hum- ble, heartfelt piety, which, in the eyes of her husband, was the crown of all her other vir- tues. When called to leave her for the duties of his profession, his heart safely trusted in her; for he knew that their little ones, guided by a mother's love and a mother's prayers, would not suffer for a father's coun- sels. Happy the children who, like the Grahams, have a pious mother to lead them  in the ways of wisdom and of peace! Mrs. Graham's health had for some time been too delicate to allow her to follow her husband in his official wanderings. A child of the North, the first years of their married 1*    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6495-00000007"/> 10     THE GRAHAMS. life were spent under the fervid skies of Florida, where the seeds of disease were planted in a constitution of unusual delicacy. In the far West, where her husband was at length ordered, they sprang up and threat- ened her life. Then, by advice of physicians, she was taken back to her native: North. A cottage among the hills of the Hudson was rented, and the breezes of her childhoodf soon restored her to a measure of health. The separation from her husband was, however, very painful to the heart of Mrs. Graham; and she was beginning to look for- ward to a happy reunion, when the peace of the country was suddenly broken by an un- looked-for war with Mexico. The news of the troubles on the Rio Grande fell like a heavy 'cloud upon her heart. While the nation was ringing its joy- bells for the splendid victories of Palo Alto 'and Resaca de la Palma, the wife of Captain   THE GRAHAMS.       " Graham shed tears of apprehension and re- gret. Hitherto the West had seemed far away; but now when slhe thought of distant Mexico, with its burning plains and hostile armies, the Mississippi grew suddenly nearer. She felt almost as though she could reach out her arms and embrace her husband inhis se- cure retreat. "Iow have I repined over this little trial," she said regretfully; " and now my heavenly Father may see fit to lay sorer burdens upon me."' With tears and supplications she then be- sought the Lord to grant her a patient sub- mission to all the orderings of his providence. It was a great struggle for her to resign her own will to the will of Heaven; but it was done at last, and a calm, sweet ,peace stole in upon her heart. When she arose from her knees, the perfume of the summer orchards was wafted in through her open window,    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6495-00000008"/> 12     THE GRA I A MS. She heard the songs of birds, and the happy voices of her own children. Every thing was now harmonious and pleasant. The Psalnm- ist's words seemed verified, "Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing shall offend them.1" Week's and months wore on, and Captain Graham's company was not yet on the list for Mexican service. Every paper was searched for intelligence and instructions from the AVar Departmnent. Still the much-dreaded order did not meet her eye. "Our own fron-, tier cannot be left unprotected," she said to herself; "and it may be my husband's lot to remain."l Such thoughts were in her mind one morn- ing, when a loud shout firom the little fiont garden drew her suddenly to the window. There stood Abran, the gardener,. with his spade fallen to the ground, gazing down the gravel path after the children, who, one and   THE  GRAHAMS.       13 all were screaming and shouting at the sight of a well known figure at the gate. ( God bless you, little ones! where is your mother?" was all she waited to hear; then hurried out, pale, but inwardly calm, to re- ceive her returned husband. My own wife!" "My darling husband!" was all the lips of either uttered, as hand in hand, preceded by the children, they entered the cottage. Each little one was greeted anew. Frank, the eldest, was praised for his tall, manly figure; Willie, for his blue eyes and golden locks, just like his mother's; Annie, for her father's love of mirth and mischief, as well as for her brown, healthful cheeks; while the little, lisping Emily was pressed fondly to his heart, and accused of having strayed away from the summer skies. There was moisture in the father's eyes all the time, which his faithful wife saw, and rightly interpreted. 2     <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6495-00000009"/> ":     THE GREAHAMS. But not until supper was eaten, and the children had gone to bed, did she inquire when hle was to sail? MWAere her own heart whispered too plainly. 'In a week," was the tremulous answer! "Who will watch over my wife and little ones?" "The same Love that will watch over and protect my husband on his mission of duty and of peril," was the heroic reply. "I will teach the children to pray more and more earnestly for their beloved fa- ther." Silent tears mingled with the tender- est heart communes that night. All the chances of war were freely discussed, and what would be the best for them all if the husband and father should fall on the battle- field. "Educate the little ones to the extent of your slender means, my wife. Instruct   THE GRAHAMS.       15 them yourself in the Bible and the great' truths of religion. Then let them follow their 'own bent in life. I have known too many noble natures dwarfed by ungenial pursuits."    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6495-00000010"/> CHAPTER    I. UCI was said and done in that one week of Captain Graham's visit. The cottage, which had only been a hired house before, was purchased, and the title-deeds safely recorded. It was not an expensive home, but cost the young officer almost his entire means. The children wished much to go down to the city and see the great vessel in which their father was to sail; and as it was their only request, when urged to make known their several wants, they were not denied. This took one whole day-a pleasant and long remembered one to them, and to their parents too-though to the latter it was not   THE GRAHAMS.       17 unmingled with  pain and anxiQus fore- bodings. When the day came for the Captain to leave home, he inquired tenderly whether his wife wished to accompany him to New York again, there to wait his departure. Her an- swer was a negative one. "I cannot part with you in the presence ot strangers," she said. "There is only One can comfort me--for your absence, and Him I can- not find in the crowd. Leave me with my. God and my children." So it was decided. Commending one an- other to the great All Father, with tears and prayers, and benedictions, the servant of his country went forth to duty in a foreign land. The children were soon consoled for their father's absence; for children's tears are very apt to be like the morning dew when the sun shines upon it, quickly dried. 2* I ' k    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6495-00000011"/> 18     THE GRAIIAMS. The little flower garden which Abram bad made was yet to be planted, and they had not forgotten to procure a variety of seeds on their late visit to New York. They had a number of pets, too, as most children have who live in the country-two white rabbits, with pink eyes, were always bothering their great black cat, which Captain Graham had named "Santa Anna," after the great Mexi- can chief. Then they had two cages of birds, and a large Newfoundland dog, as big as any polar bear. These were the house pets. Out of doors the robins sang all day in the apple orchard, while the honey-bird was weaving a nest on one of the twigs of their loftiest elms, ,where she could rock her little ones to sleep when the wind blew. A gay-coated yellow bird, with his quiet little brown mate, came every day on a visit to the fir-tree under the parlor window. The children said the two were ' " I   THE GRAHAMS.       19 ho1use-huntting, and were very careful not to frighten them away. All these things amused and interested them when they were out of school; and as they did not share in their mother's concern for their father, no children were ever, hap- pier. Mexico to them was like Missouri, only in a different place on the map. Their father would lead his fine company out on parade there as they remembered he used to do at Jefferson Barracks. It would fiighten the ugly Mexicans out of their wits to see so many gallant men with sharp swords and bayonets. Hadn't General Taylor made them run some already? and wasn't their father as brave a man as General Taylor? The children thought so; and Frank said a few more skirmishes would not be bad. So thought Annie, too; but Wilhe said fighting and bloodshed were dreadful, even in a just cause. He had studied and learned all about    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6495-00000012"/> 20     THE GRAHAMS. the battles of the Revolution, and thought it was more like Christians to settle their diffi- culties peaceably. Little Emily, who was always Willie's echo, said, "Willie knew best, and Wilhe was right." Mrs. Graham  often overheard the chil- dren's discussions on this as well as other subjects; and from their different modes of reasoning, was constantly gaining new in- sight into their respective characters. Never was a mother more concerned for the welfare of her children: never one more diligent in her efforts to sow in their hearts the seeds of the good and true. The love and obedience of her little flock rewarded her a hundred fold for all her efforts. She did not trouble their young minds with her cares and fears for the future; for she knew however long their lives might be, they would never wander back again to free, simple childhood. Frank was now twelve,   THE GRAHAMS.       21 Willie ten. They would soon be old enough to go forth and seek their own fortunes in a cold world, and no mother could follow them. How could she pray that their future years might be bright, if neglecting to make the present ones as happy as lay in her power? In the village to which she had come a stranger, Mrs. Graham had found one kind friend. It was the minister of the parish, who had been a friend and class-mate of her father in his youth. To him she spoke her anxieties freely, and received encouragement and sympathy. He brought her the latest news; softened the severest tidings, and al- ways prophesied hopefully of the future.    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6495-00000013"/> CHAPTER    XIII [HE Mexican war, is almost within your own recollection, mly young readers, and I dare 'say, if you ask your parents, they could point out to you some person or persons engaged in it. If so, go ask them of the battle of Churubusco, and of the dreadful storming of Chapultepec, for these were the two last great engagements of the war. They know how many brave hearts perished there, and will tell you some of their names. Churubusco was a strongly fortifred village, not far from the city of Mexico, toward which the commander-in-chief was fighting his way. Nearly the whole Mexican army was gathered at that point to dispute the pas-   THE GRAIAMS.       23 sage of the Americans. Captain Graham wrote all about it to his wife and children; for his own gallant company was in the en- gagement, and did nobly. The battle commenced at noon, and lasted until evening. The Americans were then victors; but a thousand of their brave men lay dead and dying on the field. After the victory of Churubusco, there was a few days cessation from fighting, and then began preparations for attacking the city of the Montezumas. Perhaps some of my young readers do not know much about Cha]pultepec, which is the name of a great hill overlooking the city of Mexico, and which guards its principal paths of entrance. On this hill once stood the palaces of the ancient Mexican monarchs. The sides of Chlapultepec which lay toward the country were very rough and craggy. On the top stood an immense stone fortress,    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6495-00000014"/> 24     TiHE GRAA II MS. called the Castle, and at the foot of the hill were several strong defenses. Among these was one very large stone building, with thick and high walls. The Mexicans called it Molingdel-Rey, or "The King's Mill." It was used for the purpose of casting cannon for the defenses of the city. General Worth was directed by the Colinander-in-Chief to attack and destroy the King's :Mill before the storming of the great Castle on the top of Chapultepec was begun. It was a difficult work, and one of the bloodiest on record. The whole army of Santa Anna, fourteen thousand strong, was posted around the hill, and defended the posi- tion with obstinate bravery. But on the 8th of September, the gallant Worth had acconm- plished the work assigned hila. In this battle-the battle of Molingdel-Rey--Cap- tain Graham, with more than seven hundred of his comrades, fell mortally wounded.   THE GRAHAMS.       25 I-e did not live to witness the storming of the Castle, which took place four days after; nor to hear the triumplhal shouts of the vic- torious army as it entered the captured city, and planted the "Stars and Stripes" on the roof of the national palace. Hie was buried outside the walls by the hands of his own sur- viving men, who loved him and had followed him faithfully until death. The same dispatches which caused the heart of a great nation to leap with joy, brought darkness and deolation to many a home and hearthside. Amid booming can- non and blazing torches a solemn undertone of anguish was heard throughout the land for the brave who had fallen never to return. It was a bright October morning, when Frank Gralam came running from school quite out of breath. "There must be another victory, mother," he exclaimed; "for there is a great can- 3   .      .        .    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6495-00000015"/> 26    TTHE G   IAHAMS. nonading at New York. I should'nt wonder if our army had taken the city of Mexico at last. I feel like huzzaing at the very thought of it." His mother turned pale at his words; but she only replied-"These victories make me tremble, my son! They cost very dear." "Father has been in several battles, and has not lost a hair of lis head," was the graver remark of Frank. "Many children's fathers have fallen, nevertheless," returned his mother. "We must try not to think of ourselves alone, my dear boy." Mrs. Graham went quietly about her work, but the color did not return to her cheeks that forenoon. Frank, who watched her closely, and was sorry he had come to tell her of the cannonading, saw her wipe tears from her eyes, wlen she did not know he was look- ing at her.   THE GRAHAM. S27 ' Don't worry, mother," he said, at last, going and kissing her!"Mr. Wood went down this morning on the Hendrick Hudson, and will bring up the latest New York pa- pers. I didn't know you ever worried much, mother l She pressed her lips softly to -his, but made no reply in words. Her heart was too full to speak. The other children came at noon, but not a word was said about the cannonading below. Frank met the gils at the gate, and asked them not to speak of it in the presence of their mother. Willie never needed a caution. Frank would gladly have staid from school that afternoon, but did not like to propose it; so the children all went to their lessons, while Mrs. Graham was left alone. She lifted her heart to heaven in silent prayer, and strug- gled to compose herself for whatever might come! But as the hour for the boat drew    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6495-00000016"/> 28     THE GRAHAM S. near, she could only sit by her window, her hands clasped tightly together, and watch and wait. By and by she saw the steam rising like a little long white cloud above. the river. Soon after she heard the groaning of the engines and the sound of the bell, as the boat neared the landing. Every moment was an age now. She was sorry she had not kept one of the boys to send down for the papers, though she believed, if there were really news of importance, Mr. Wood would be sure to bring it to her. Nor was M/rs. Graham mistaken. It was not long before the figure of the' venerable old man was seen on its way to the cottage. Frank and Willie noticed him as lhe passed their school-room window, and ex- changed anxious glances. Frank got permis- sion to speak. "Hadn't we better ask to go home, Wil-   THE GRAHAMS.       29 lie?" he inquired. Mother wont blame us under the circumstances." Willie thought they had, and leave was asked and granted to both. "I have thought of mother all the after- noon, Willie," Frahk said, first breaking the silence, as they walked hand in hand up the hll. "So have I," was the low and sorrowful reply. The old man's feet lagged from weariness or reluctance to impart his tidings, and the boys were in time to open the gate for him. Both looked him earnestly in the face, eager to hear his customary pleasant greeting. But he scarcely seemed to notice them at all, as lie walked with hands folded behind him and eyes fixed on the ground, up the gravel path to the cottage door. "Mrs. Graham," he said, as that lady met him in the hall, pale and trembling with ap- 3*    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6495-00000017"/> 30     THE GRAHAMS. prehension, "I have been dowzi to thee city." And that was all he said, as he stepped before her into the open parlor. Frank and Willie took each a hand of their mother, and led her to the sofa. They had never seen Mr. Wood appear so strange, and were afiraid he had ireally got bad news for them of their fatherl. "Do you think you can bear the afflictive tidings I bring to you, my daughter," the old man said at last, taking a seat by her side? "The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord!" Mrs. Graham fixed upon him one long, searching glance as he spoke, and read in his kindly, pitying countenance only the confir- mation of her worst fears. "OO my, God!" she exclaimed, in tearless agony, "What shall I do?" "Trust in him! trust in him still, my poor child, though he slay thee," said the nowr   THE GRAHAMS.       31 weeping clergyman. "He has promised to be the widow's God, and the Father of the fatlerless." "I calnnot see him in this stroke," she re- plied, scarcely conscious of what she said. "It is heavier than I can bear!" "Cast your burden on the Lord and he will sustain you, weak tlough you may be. Let me pray with you before I go." Frank and Willie knelt down side by side, while great tears ran down tleir chleeks. They could not believe their father was really dead, and that they should never again behold the light of' his pleasant countenance in the land of the living. The very thought of it almost broke their hearts. After commending them  all to God, Mr. Wood left them, and Mrs. Graham sank back on the sofa faint and exhausted. Her eyes were closed, and her cheeks and lips were the very hue of death. She took no notice of    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6495-00000018"/> 32     THE G AIIAMS. Frank or Willie, who knelt down beside her, each holding one of her hands. The sobbings of Annie and little Emaily, when they came and heard the dreadful news, did not arouse her to speak to them. But as they watched her, her lips moved tremulously. She was praying inwardly for strength to bear the will of the Most High. You are very faint and ill, mother," Wil- he said at length, pressing the hand he held to his lips. "Dear mother, let me go and bring you some tea?" c I cannot drink it," she replied feebly. "Won't you try; mother? She nodded her head, and Willie went; quickly to prepare it. She only wet her lips, however, when it came, then shook her head, and motioned him to take the cup away. "What shall we do?" asked Annie, laying her head on Frank's shoulder, and bursting forth in a new paroxysm of grief 2   THE GRAHAMS.       33 "I don't know," he said. "We must try and do the best we can; but I am afraid it will kill mother." Then the children clustered together in the kitchen and wept as though their young hearts were breaking; all but llie, who was up in his little chamber asking 0od to be their father, and to have pity on them, and not take away their dear mother also. When he went down,'the tears were dried from his cheeks. Mrs. Graham had kept no, servant for a number of months, wishing to spend their small income on the education of their children. So he set himself to work to lay the cloth for supper. Annie and Emily tried to help him, crying all the time. But Frank said there was no use in getting sup- per, which no one could eat.

"Taste of it for my sake-won't you, mo- ther?" he asked in a broken voice, putting the cup to her lips. She' sippd a little, and again motioned it away. Frank went softly and put a fire in the .parlor grate, for the evening was getting cold. A few neighbors, who had heard of Captain Graham's death, came in to offer their sympathy and aid.  Mrs. Graham thanked them for their k]indness; but there was nothing to. do, and they felt that sorrow like hers was unapproachable. After they were gone, the children all went together and kissed their mother, and prom- ised to love and help her all their lives, and to be kind to one another. She kissed them each in return, and bade God bless and keep them. "I shall need your love more than ever   THE. GRAHAMS.       35 now, my poor fatherless ones!" she added with overflowing tenderness. The sound of her mother's voice complete- ly overcame her, and Annie sobbed aloud. "My poor dear father!"Her outhurst was contagious, and mother and children wept together for the first time without control. After awhile Mrs. Graham spoke calmly. "Bring me the paper now, Frank, and see if you can read the account there given." He took it from the table, where Mr. Wood laid it down when he went away, and read the particulars of the battle of -Moling del-Rey--the battle which had made them orphans - and afterwards of the terrible storming and victory of Ohapultepec.    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6495-00000020"/> CHAPTE R IXV PBIIE sorest grief a child can know is the death of a tender parent; and the poor fatherless Gralha ms felt as if they could not be consoled. They cared less for their garden and for their pets. The canaries would sing all day, and Santa Anna, the cat, would lie and purr in the sun, while they felt very sad and unhappy. The white rabbits would bite their feet and their fingers to provoke them to a race; but their feet seemed like their hearts, too heavy for mirth and play. Old Sultan alone, the shaggy Newfound- land dog, seemed to understand that some- thing had happened. He missed the merry voices of the children, and walked silent and '" '              t. -   THE GRAIIAMS.       37 sullen around the house, sometimes going to his mistress' room, and laying his huge black paws on her lap, while he looked gravely in her face as though pleading for some ex- planation. '"Sultan knows mamma," said little Emily one day, when the dog stood thus before her. Frank says "he knows how sorry we all are, and woul4 tell us so if he could. He didn't even bark at the butcher's dog to-day, but went and laid down beside Willie under the fir-tree. Don't you think he knows, mamma?" "He knows some change has come over us, my love. He misses his old gambols in the yard and at the river. How much more he comprehends I cannot tell." "But he understands what we say to him; I am sure he does, mamma.

And the children all, with tearful faces, hastened firom the cottage, pat- ting and caressing the faithful brute, and calling him by all the old familiar names. Never afterwards had Sultan any reason to complain of neglect; for little hands played with his long silken ears and shook his paws in the morning, when they went away to school; and at bedtime they bade him good night, as thougll he had been a human being. Even Mrs. Graham, wlen he stretched him- self before her lonely door, with his head be- tween his paws, as though ready to spring upon the first intruder, could not help strok- ing his black coat, and saying to him, "You will do all you can to guard us, good fellow!" And so he did. But it was to the care of the great Shep- herd of Israel, whose eye never slumbers nor sleeps, that the widowed mother committed      <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6495-00000022"/> 40     TH:E GRAAMS. herself and the young orphans. She knew that his ear was ever open to hear the cry of those who called upon him, and that he would never turn away from any who made him their trust. Every morning and even- ing she called upon hiA name in the presence of her family, and taught them the truths of his Holy Word. It was no new custom. She had done this from the time of her first separation from her husband; and even the lisping Emily could tell the story of Jesus from the manger in Bethlehem to the cross. Her husband's wish, that they should be educated to the extent of her slender means, led her to frugality and self-denial. Nor was his more particular in- junction forgotten, that they should be allow- ed to choose their own life-paths, after their minds were fortified with the precepts of reli- gion. Often and often did the faithftil mo- ther revolve in her own anxious mind the   THE G AHAMS.       41 question of their choice; and the thought of how soon they. would probably leave her for hew homes and spheres of action, made her very diligent in her work and words of love. Frank was now a tall, manly boy, growing every month more and more like his lost fa- ther. From the time of his father's death, he assumed as a natural right the peculiar care and protectionslip of his mother, walking to and from church, at her side, carrying her shawl, and folding it around her, if needful, in a manner so kind and affectionate, that even strangers remarked it.  From that period he was 'never the gay, thoughtless boy he had been before. He seemed to feel, and act too, like one early invested with the cares and responsibilities of manhood. Mueh as he loved his mother, she could not help feel- ing regret sometimes that he no longer sat at her feet a childlike learner like his brothers T, .    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6495-00000023"/> 42     THE GRAHAMS. and sisters-that he was so fast becoming her companion; for she knew he would only ripen into lmanhood to go from her and leave her widowed heart more lonely than ever. Tile bringing home of his fath6r's sword aroused his whole nature. His eye kindled and his heart leaped at the sight of the well- remembered blade. "Take it, my son," his mother said, falter- ingly; and the youth took it from the offi- cer's hands, and pressed it to his lips. It was afterwards lhung in his own little chamber. Wilhe was very unlike Frank in looks and disposition. Naturally very delicate, he had always been distinguished for an  almost feminine sweetness of manner. He possessed but little of his brother's daring and adven- turous spirit, but was more of a student, and a closer thinker and reasoner.

Sometimes when talking with him, and gaz- ing into the dopths of his clear blue eyes, which seemed to behold truth in the far away distance, his mother's heart trembled. She remembered the poet's words-"The good die first," and feared her gentle boy might be an early mark for the Destroyer, who has all seasons for his own. ,          .'    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6495-00000024"/> CHPTER V+ NE evening, nearly two years after her husband's' death,Mrs. Graham was sitting as usual in the midst of her children. The lessons were all learned, and it was not yet time for the Bible and evening prayers. So they began to talk about 'one thing and another, and at last of the different aims of persons in life. Then, for the first time, the mother mentioned their father's wish, that his' children should be uncontrolled in the choice of their relative pursuits.  "Did he really?" asked Frank, with a brightened eye. "O I am so glad." "Why so, my son?'   THE GRAHAMS.       45 "Because, mother, from my earliest recol- lection, I have never had but one wish re- specting my future life-work. Since father's death, I have tried very hard to forget it, thinking that it might give you pain, and that if lie could speak to me, he would say again as he said when he went away to me, 'Never forget nor neglect your mother, my son; and never wilfully disobey her.' I have been thinkinag for some time whether I hadn't bet- ter try to get a place in old Mr. Fowler's store for the sake of being near you, and try- ing to help you; but the thought of being tied to a counter for life was so disagreeable, I couldn't bear to mention it. I had a dif- ferent ambition, mother." "Speak it freely, Frank, whatever it may be; rest assured I shall not oppose it. Good men are needed in every walk of life, and I trust my son will make a good man wherever duty or inclination shall lead him."    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6495-00000025"/> "     THE GRAHA!MS. "God helping himn, he will make a mian, of whomn his mother need not' be ashanm- ed," he replied, with a flushed cheek and a quivering lip. "I ask for nothing but my brave father's sword, mother; for like him I wish to write my name on the page of my country's history. I dream of the 'Eagle and Stars' when I sleep, mother; and there are no sounds I ever hear half so sweet to me as the music of the fife and drum." Mrs. Graham bowed her head and dropped a tear. Every look and tone of Frank's re- called to her mind the image of the dear departed. "Speak, mother," he said, rising and put- ting one of his arms lovingly around her. "If my choice makes you very sorry, I will give it up, though I have no other wish as re- gards a profession." "Your choice is mine," she said, saiiling on him affectionately through her tears.

"Tey live who for their country die /" said Willie, in a low, sweet voice. "But, mo- ther, in the book you read to us last evening was written, "Peace hath her victories." I remember your explanation. I know how large is God's field -how great is God's work! And I know how many laborers are needed to plant and sow before the great har- vest of the world. Don't you think, dear mo- ther, I could help a little? I don't care for fame, nor for greatness; but if I could leave my name on the heart of some poor human being, I should be ready to die,"    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6495-00000026"/> 48     TH E GR A II AS . As Willie spoke, he sat down with his cus- tomary humility at his mother's feet. Tak- ing her hand in his, he looked up into her face with one of those same heavenly glances which had often made her heart sink within her. But now it swelled high with a rap turous joy, as she said- "God bless you, my angel Willie!"As she pressed him to her heart, the children were all silent, until little Emily arose and put her dimpled fingers into his golden locks, and whispered-"God loves you, Willie, dear, darling brother!" Every one felt that little Emily's words were true, and that God did indeed love the gentle Willie. Once more his mother's lips were pressed to his broad white forehead. Then she spoke for some minutes of the great world-field wherein Christians are called to work-some with their five shining talents some with two,   T H E GRAHAMS.       49 and some with only one, but laboring patient- ly, still looking forward to the same-" well done, good and faithful servant,"-the equal reward of untiring effort. "And what will my daughter's choice be? Where on the world's page would my Annie write her name?" her mother pleasantly asked. "Or has she not yet learned to look beyond the cottage with its sunshine and shadows?" Annie Graham was a beautiful girl, with an olive-tinted cheek and hair black as the night. Her fine healthy countenance was in singular contrast to the fair complexion of the delicate Willie. In her disposition she was frank, but impulsive almost to a fault; full of generous thoughts and purposes, but more easily persuaded from the straight-forward line of duty than eithfr of her brothers or sister.

How fervently did she pray that her brilliant daughter might shine with the holy light of a star, and be safely transplanted iu the heav- ens at last. Annie wept freely while her brothers were making choice of their respective life-paths; but when her mother's words-" where would my Annie write her name"-fell on her ears, the light mood came back again, and she an- swered gayly. "A woman must write wherever she, can, mother, and with just such a pen as is put into her hands. You know very well that I cannot take a sword like Frank and fight for fame or fortune; and Iknow very well that I am not good like Willie. If I should go a missionary, I should teach the heathen to cut off one another's noses, or something else as   THE GRAHAMS.        51 bad. But don't look so sadly about it, mno- ther. I am a little girl yet, and shall never go a missionary, if I can help it. But I'll tell you what I will do, by and by, mother. There is something beside, mischief in my heart-tlhere is music; and I cannot keep it shut up always. Some day I will write songs, and teach every miserable little creature I can find to sing them. I will truly, mother; and make the world stare, too, for wonder!" "Never think of the world my immortal one!" tenderly replied Mrs. Graham. "If ever you sing, sing like the birds, for the sim- ple love of singing. Sing like one who is one day to sing with the angels! Never write songs for the world's praise, my child, but for the comfort of the poor and lowly. The sweetest earthly strains are ever heard in the valley, and not on the mountain tops. The patls of fame are rugged, and the wo- man who walks in them will find snares for    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6495-00000028"/> 52  \   THE GRAIIAMS. her feet, and arrows for her breasts. O, my child! remember your mother's warning, and beware of striving for fame." Half terrified at the earnestness of her io- ther's words, the fill meaning of which she did not comprehend, little Emily laid her head on her shoulder and exclaimed-"What should a woman care about such things, mo- ther! I am sure I will never write my name for the whole world to look at. I will put it into a letter as you used to yours to papa, and seal it up for those that love me. I will, in- deed, and no one besides shall ever get a look at it." ' Bless you, I know you will," returned Mrs. Graham. "By such as you, my dear baby-dove, the hearths and homes of men are hallowed. You don't know what it means now, little one; but if you live, the lessons of life, and of the heart too, will be soon enough learned."   THE GRAHAMS.       53 Each of that little group in turn were folded to the mother's heart. Then the Bible was brought, and she read to them the ninety- first Psalm- "He that dwelleth in the secret places of the Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. "I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in him will I trust. "Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. "Iie shall cover thee wiit his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust; his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. "Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day; "Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wast- eth at noonday. 5*    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6495-00000029"/> 54     TH E GRAHAMS.

I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him. "With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation." When the psalm was finished, Mrs. Graham knelt down and prayed with a full heart for wisdom and strength to direct her in the right performance of a widowed mother's du- ties. She prayed for heavenly aims for her- self and little ones; that they might all be kept from the temptations of the world, and delivered from its evils; and more fervently still, that whatever their earthly fortunes might be, the names ,of her immortal children might be writen in "the Lamb's Book of Life." i '     <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6495-00000030"/> CH -X PTER VIX k O T many months after the incidents mentioned in the last chapter, the cottage on the Hudson was favor- ed with a visitor of distinguished rank- a-gentleman who had filled the highest office in his native land. He introduced' himself, and very courteous- ly stated his errand. From a friend in Wash- ington, he had heard that the widow of the lamented Captain Grahail was desirous of entering a son at West Point. He had been there at a recent' examination, and found two or three vacancies. If it were her wish, the youth might present himself for examination immediately, and not wait until' the next commencement.   THE GRAHAMS.        57 Mrs; Graham  strove to thank him, but turned so pale, the gentleman apprehended some mistake, and commenced an apology. "You are riglt, sir," she said, recovering herself. "I made the application for my old- est son, who is very desirous of a military career. I was not looking for so speedy a re- sponse, however." The stranger read the mother's feelings plainly as she spoke, and replied- ' It is the policy of the Government to first favor the sons of those who have rendered their country essential service. A son of the brave Captain Graham could not have asked in vain to follow the profession of his father. May he prove as faithful in peace, and as hero-hearted in the hour of danger." "Frank is like his father in many re- spects," Mrs. Graham replied simply; ("and I trust he will never prove recreant to duty. I am very sorry he is not here to thank you    <pb n="58 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6495-00000031"/> 58     THE GRAHAMS. personally, sir, for your interest in his ap- pointment; but he is not yet returned fromn school." "I will call and acquaint him with the success of the application, if it is your wish, madam. I recollect passing the school build- ing on my way hither." It was just what the mother would have asked; and so she told the gentleman in a grateful tone, once more thanking him for the trouble he had taken in the matter. When he was gone, a few womanly tears calmed her ill-concealed emotion. Her eyes were scarcely dried, when she heard Frank's voice; and the next moment the exultant youth had his arms clasped play- fully around her neck. "Now, mother, you mustn't fret about  my going away, but wish me joy. How do you suppose Mr. Van Buren ever came to know I wished the appointment  In my   .

"I wrote to one of your father's friends of the War Department, a short time since, my son. I did not tell you for fear of disappoint- rment." "Then it was you, my darling mother-my very best friend, who was so thoughtful for me?  Mother, I thank you!"And Frank Graham, though his lip trembled a little, spoke with the dignity of a man. ' It gwill be very hard for me to part with you, my son! I find I have been leaning on you more than I supposed." "You shall always lean on me, mother; and if God spares my life, I will never prove a mean support-will never fail you. It is only a little way to West Point; and it may be the officers will allow me to come home sometimes. If not, you, and Willie, and the girls will often come and see me, I know,"     <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6495-00000033"/> 60     THE GRAHAMS. Mrs. Graham tried hard to answer Frank cheerfully, and to make him feel how much she sympathized with him in his joy; but her heart was sensible of the weight of a new care. Her first-born was about to go forth into the rugged paths of the world, and she knew his warm generous nature would often be chilled by contact with the cold and self- ish. Even this pained her less than the moral peril to which he would be exposed on every side. "Are his principles strong enough to with- stand temptation?" she asked herself, and asked him, too, often and often, in those hours when her fingers were busy miaking ready for his departure. "Never forget God and your - solemn obligations to him, my son!" was her repeated exhortation!"Notling could grieve me like an unprincipled child." "Never can I forget him  while I re- member my mother," was the serious reply.   THE GRAHAMS.        61 'For your sake, if not for my own, I will try-- "To be as good as circumstances will allow," broke in the lively Annie, in a tone of affected merriment, while tears shone in her deep eyes. "When you or I are unicom- mnon good, Frank, it will be grace sure, and not nature." "My child,' said Mrs. Graham, in a softly chiding voice, "His grace is sufficient for thee, and for us all! Never speak lightly of it." Frank was gone in a few weeks, and the cottage seemed for many days after very still and lonely. Willie tried his best to fill his brother's vacant place, performing every little office which, as the eldest, Frank had as- sumed hitherto, in a manner so delicate, so like himself, as quite touched his mother's heart. "Blessed are the meek,' she often ex-    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6495-00000034"/> 62     THE GRAHAMS. claimed, when gazing upon. Willie's serene countenance, seldom or never ruffled by a breath of passion! And Willie Graham was truly blest, for the "peace that passeth un- derstanding" filled his youthful soul, and kept it unspotted from the world. From a child, he had heard the voice of the Good Shepherd, and had followed his call; and when weak and weary, as he often was, he rested sweetly in the bosom of his love. Once in their confidential conversations, his mother had spoken to him about uniting himself to the church of which she was a member; but his reply was, "Let me wait until I feel sure I shall never dishonor it."   CHAPTER VXXI "ETTER came from Frank in due time, bringing gladness to the hearts of all. His examination and first efforts were certified as highly creditable; and the officers who had known his father seemed disposed to treat him with marked kindness. "Were. it not for thinking so much of 'the loved ones at home,'" he wrote, "I should be the happiest fellow in the world. But at night, when I am through with my exercises, I long to see some one or some thing from the cottage.

Good bye, and God bless you all, is the daily prayer of "Your affectionate son, "FRANK." The next letter brought pain mingled with the pleasure. Frank had received a repri- mand. He wrote all the circumstances with- out palliation; and Annie, who was always her brother's apologist; said, "She gloried in his spunk. He had done no more than any pirited boy was justified in doing."

You shall give your opinion about it, reader, when you have heard the story. Before leaving home, Frank promised his mother to attend faithfully to his private de- votions. This was not always easy to do without observation; and when it came to the ears of a portion of the students, they turned the practice to ridicule. One of them, an unprincipled youth from the Southwest, nicknamed by his fellows the "Mississippi Blade," upbraided him openly one day, and called him coward. "WTo will prove it?" asked Frank kind- ling with indignation. "Yellow-head Mississippi himself!" shout- ed half a dozen voices at once. " lie is al- ways ready for action." "Let him come on then!

"Good! good! Make him swallow his words, then," said the lookers-on. And with this encouragement, Frank Graham whipped his antagonist until he called loudly for quarter. Now, all this happened under the eye of one of the officers of the institution, who had the offenders arraigned, and publicly repri- manded. This circumstance gave his mother much uneasiness-not the reprimand, but the ac7 tion which drew it forth. That her son was no coward, she knew well. That to please his mother, and fulfil his promise to her, he would night and morning go through the form of devotion in the eyes of all the whole world, if it were necessary, she really be- lieved.

Mrs. Graham knew well the proud but' generous nature of her son; and her gentle treatment of his fault drew from him a child- like, humble confession. How many parents treat their children as though mildness and gentleness were incompatible with Christian faithfulness? Willie labored very hard in school and out, in his brother's absence. The care of the         *    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6495-00000037"/> 68     THE GRAHAMS. vegetable garden and of the cow--a light task for the two boys together-was more severe for him, the weaker one, alone. He often said to his mother, "Frank could do more with a hoe or spade in one hour than I can do in six. I always knew he did more than his part of the work." But when Mrs. Graham endeavored to per- suade him to get assistance, and not over- exert himself, he replied, that the very exer- cise might give him more-strength. With all his exertions, however, the close of the season found him less robust than the Spring. There was very little out-of-door work for him in the winter, and his school tasks were no longer hard. He had conquered the out- setting difficulties, and the-classic realms were to him now regions of perpetual delight. Wilhe was a scholar by nature, and recog- nized and loved the genius of the scholars of antiquity. At the close of the spring session,                      .   THE GRAHAMS.       69 his teacher pronounced him fitted for the best college in the country. Then, for the first time, arose the question in his mind, 'I How was he to go?"He knew that their income was barely sufficient for present expenses; and that his mother practised economy, not only as a virtue, but as a household necessity. The ministry was the life-work Willie Graham had long before fixed upon in his own mind. To fit himself for the work was now the subject of his daily thoughts. " If were older, I could teach," he reflected; "but who would employ a boy not yet fif- teen, and feeble at that?" Vocation was almost over, and he had not once mentioned the subject to his mother. Mrs. Graham had not even heard the decision of the teacher, and fancied Willie would for some time yet be a pupil at the village semi- nary. The day before the commencement of the    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6495-00000038"/> 70     THE GRAHAMS. summer term, however, Mr. Wood, their venerable pastor, was paying a visit to the cottage. His conversation with the children turned naturally upon their several studies, and he questioned them all of their progress. Willie colored deeply, turning his eyes at the same time toward his mother, as he replied, C his course was finished." "You don't say you are all ready for col- lege now, my boy? You have then a nice little season for rest this Summer." "I don't expect to be able to enter for some years yet, sir; but hope in time to earn the means." His mother observed with what evident re- luctance he spoke, and felt quite sure it was because she had been a listener. She thought much on the subject for a day or two, but said nothing about it to Willie. In her anxiety to aid her dear boy, all thought of self was gone. Even the pain al I   THE GRAHAMS.        71 of parting with him was not much in her ,mind. i "If Willie goes away we shall then have two or three vacant rooms, and I can take a few of the seminary boarders. What it adds to my care it will detract from the loneliness, and the former is preferable to the latter." So Mrs. Graham reasoned herself to believe. To take boarders seemed, on the whole, the best thing she could do under the circum- stances; the only thing, in fact, unless she should mortgage the cottage and garden, as she at first meditated doing. But for several reasons she decided on the boarders. The girls would be able to render her some assist- ance morning and evening. Emily was al- ready an accomplished little housewife, and for Willie's sake, neither would shrink from exertion and self-denial. This the mother knew very well. One morning, when Wilhe was at work in o    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6495-00000039"/> 72     THE GRAHAMS. the garden, Mrs. Graham confided to her daughters her plan, and inquired what each was willing to do to help' their brother 2 Their replies were more than she had ex pected. "I can give up my music lessons and morning practice as well as not," said Annie, and play over the old pieces in the evening, which will do me just about as much good. Then, as to French, the professor says I can speak it now like a native, and that is well enough for a Yankee. There you will have a saving of seventeen dollars a quarter; to say nothing of the time. German I have but just coimnenced, and must persevere in. As to the boarders, I am sure we can get along with them nicely." "I know so," said Emily, whose turn it was now to speak. "I would stay at home from school all the time rather than not lhave Willie go to college when he is such a fine   THE GRAHAMS.       73 scholar, and so good too. I don't care much for school or study myself, it tires me so! I had a good deal rather be a nice housekeeper like you, mother. Mrs. Graham smiled, and her purpose was fixed. She went out into the garden where Wilhe was busy trimming the currant and gooseberry bushes, and communicated to him her wish, that he should enter Yale the next commenecement. "It is my own wish, too," he answered pleasantly; "but unless we can find the fowl that lays the golden egg, I don't see how it can be brought about." "I have found the bird," was her reply. "You know it belonged to an old woman from the first. To speak plainly, my son, I think I have found a way to help you to college." She then explained her plan, and told him of the girls' hearty concurrence. Wilhe was 4  .     <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6495-00000040"/> 74     THE GRAHAM S.. opposed to it, urging as his weightiest reason her own delicate health, and inability to per- form hard labor. But Mrs. Graham had no idea of being dis- suaded from her purpose. So she told Willie; and his moistened eyes, as he walked by her side to the cottage, spoke the grateful emo- tions of hip heart.    CXHAP TE R VIXXX NCCE more the work of preparation was urged forward at the cottage. Very little of the anxiety which agitated the mother's heart, when her eldest son went away-anxiety for his moral and spiritual welfire-was now felt for Willie. He was going to a different school, and not only so, but with principles firmly estab- lished beyond his years. It was for the phy- sical health and strength of her son alone the mother now trembled. Willie's bodily strength had never kept pace with his mental growth. The latter needed redraint, the former encouragement. But as labor wearied and depressed him, while study rendered him light and buoyant, o    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6495-00000041"/> 766     THE GRAHAMS. Mrs. Graham thought the former unsuited to his delicate Constitution, and fondly hoped the latter might prove the very stimulus re- quired.  : The weeks of Summer flew   quickly. There were so many things which Willie could do for his mother and sisters, while they sewed for him, that his time was all oc- cupied. He had no lessons, and the summer days were long. Not a weed was left in the garden, not a trellis broken, not a gate which would not swing open at the lightest touch. "I never dreamed you were such a "Jack- of-all-trades," Annie said to him one day when he took the girls out to show them some new improvement!"No hinges will ever creak at your doors, Willie." "He was always such a darling," said Emily, putting an arm around him fondly; "and I don't know what we shall do when he is gone."  ,    THE GRAHAMS.       " That was a happy summer for them all. Frank got leave of absence, and came home for a few days, in his uniform, taller and hand- somer than when he went away, but the same generous loving son and brother still. Now, while he remained, the sweet family ties grew and strengthened, and twined them- selves more closely around each heart every day and continually. What mystic cords are those little cords of human affection! The first Sabbath in July was Willie's birth-day. It was the communion Sabbath also in the church of which Mrs. Graham was a member. On the morning of the lecture day preceding, he spoke to her of his desire to accompany her and offer himself to the flock of Christ for membership. His mo- ther's heart overflowed with joy at the pro- position. She knew Wilhe had long been a faithful young servant of the cross, and be- lieved the ordinances of the church would /    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6495-00000042"/> 78     THE GRAHAMS. not only refresh and strengthlen him in the Christian course, but prove a safeguard against temptation. "To you that believe, he is precious," were the words of the affectionate pastor that dgiy. "And no better test of qualification and fitness for Christian fellowship and communion could be desired," he said, "than the preciousness of the Saviour to the soul." It was just what the young disciple needed to give courage to a heart so distrustful of its own worthiness. Never will the memory of that Sabbath- day fade from the recollection of his brothers and sisters. Never will they forget the heavenly expression which lighted up Willie's face, as he %tood alone there in the aisleof the little church, bowing a meek assent to the doctrines of the Holy Scriptures, and promising to live all his life long to the glory of God. Frank was much affected, and said to his   THE GRAHAMS.       79 mother as he .walked home from church by her side, "Willie is too good! I am afraid we shall not keep him long! God grant your fears may not prove pro- phetic!" solemnly ejaculated his mother. "But come life or come death, no evil will happen to Willie!" Frank went away soon, and August came, the month for commencement at Yale. / Mr. Wood was going to New   Haven to meet his class, and Wilhe was to accompany him. His trunk was sent, and his mother and sisters walked with him to tli boat. "It will be much pleasanter than going alone would have been," they said to one another. "Mr. W5ood is well acquainted in New Haven." Mr. Wood was a sincere friend of Willie, and had promised to use his influence in se- curing him pleasant and comfortable accom- modations. He had before been to Mrs.    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6495-00000043"/> 80     THE GRA IAMS. Graham, and offered to advance money for Willie's college course, if she, wished it; but she had saved sufficient for one term, and pre- ferred being independent. The parting was a very cheerful one, and the mother and sisters went back to the cot- tage pleased that they could make exertion and self-denial for one so dear. When it was known that Mrs. Graham at her pleasant home would take boarders, ap- plications were numerous. One of these was the music teacher, whose lessons Annie had recently discontinued, for reasons she was not ashalned to confess. The lady, as much de- lighted with her frankness as with her gene- rous self-denial, insisted on their playing to- gether every evening. So her musical educa- tion was not suffering from want of practice. Indeed she wrote Willie, who was a good deal concerned about it, that she had never before made as rapid proficiency.  .o    THE GRAHAMS.        81 Annie loved music, and loved poetry too, and had spoken from her very heart when she said, "some day I will write songs." Three years had passed since that evening, when they all made choice of their life-work, and Annie had already fulfilled her promise by writing articles quite above the ordinary school-girl sort: little poems which promised a brilliant success in the future. By rising an hour earlier in the morning, the girls had time for their share of the house- hold employment, and for their lessons also, for which their mother was very solicitous. The four boarders were a burden far less grievous than anticipated, and every thing went on as pleasantly as before at the cottage. Mrs. Graham was the very em- -bodiluent of system, and could, with her neatness and order, accomplish much more than many robust persons. "( A place for eveiy thing and every thing in its place,'    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6495-00000044"/> 82    .THE GRAHAMS. is a maxim no person can afford to be ignorant of," she often said to her chil- dren; and it was one of the laws of her household.   CHAPTER IX. LETTERS from  New  Haven came regularly as the weeks.  There was no need of Willie's repeating in every one how happy he was there, and how grateful he felt to his mother and sisters for their sacrifices on his account. They could read it all in every sentence and every line. He loved the society of men of learn- ing and genius, and had found it. Among his fellow-students there were many of con- genial tastes and pursuits, anxious, like him- self, to make the most of present advantages. And if there were others who came there only to spend money and receive a de- gree, they were not the chosen companions    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6495-00000045"/> 84     THE GRAIIAMS. of one whose great life-work was ever in his mind. Wilhe had a room-mate altogether after his own heart, and in this he regarded him- self as extremely fortunate. He was a youth of lofty aims and of genuine piety, and the two soon became firm friends. Many a line in Willie's letters home spoke of his new as- sociate, Herbert Lincoln, who was a Bos- tonian by birth and residence. Lincoln's mother, like his own, was a widow. Like Willie Graham, he too had an only brother-a young lawyer, already en- tered upon the practice of his profession in his native city. But he had no sisters; and often, when the two were comparing family notes, playfully proposed to his room-mate the relinquishment of one of his to him, in order, as he eaid, to equalize their earthly gifts. Similarity of pursuit was also added; for Herbert Lincoln had set his heart, too, on   THE'GR   A M S.     85 the gospel ministry, not for the display of his fine talents, but for the simple desire of doing good. All these things and many more Willie wrote in his letters to his mother and sisters, to whom no one thing relative to the beloved absent one was uninteresting. Once Herbert wrote. himself to Mrs. Graham, while Willie lay on the bed with headache; and in this letter he informed her that her son was winning all the honors ot his class. With a very natural pride in his success came the fear again that Wilhe was over-exerting himself, though assured by him in every letter there was no danger; his les- sons were so easy, and the teachers so ready at all times to render the students assistance. After he had been home in the winter for a few days, looking as well as when he left, and as happy as possible, his mother quite dis- missed the anxiety from her mind.    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6495-00000046"/> 86     THE GRAHAMS. The next vacation was a long one, and his room-mate insisted on Willie's visiting Bos- ton; but as he had not seen his brother for a year, he could not be prevailed upon to ac- cept the invitation. "Come up the Hudson with me instead," he urged. "It is summer now, and the country is glorious there. I want to show you my mother and sisters, and the pets too. You know them all now. We can go to West Point too, unless Frank can join us at home." So it was at length de- cided. Willie wrote home, and the whole house was full of joy and pleasant anticipation of the summer vacation, which fortunately oc- curred at the same time of the vacation of the village institution. The girls would be free from school, and the house free of strangers. There would be pleasant rooms for Willie and his friend, and for Frank also, if he could only get leave to come.   THE GRAHAMS.       87 Every thing within and without the cot- tage smied a welcome upon the two youths on th ir arrival. Annie and Emily waited for them with Sultan in the little flower- garden, which was in full blossom and odor. Mrs. Graham, with her kind motherly bless- ing, stood in the open door. Now, isn't this a snug little place, Lin- coln?"' asked Willie of his friend, with all his old simplicity, after the greetings were over, and the first observations had been made. "It seems to me there is nothing quite like it in the world."' "'It is perfect," Herbert replied with enthusiasm. "Such a river view on one hand, and cultivated landscape on the other, with the mountains looming up in the dis- tance, leave nothing to desire. The scenery of the Hudson is fine beyond my expecta- tion," Wilhe had grown quite tall, and pale and    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6495-00000047"/> 88     THE GRAHAIMS. thin too, his mother fancied as she surveyed his form, and face. Only tall, I think, mother," he said, after listening to her impression of the change in him; "that gives the idea of thinness, you know. If I am pale, I mean to rub my face against Annie's for color, if I cannot get a good brown in the open air. I compliment you, sister, when I tell you you look like a daughter of the sun." "A child of her own native South truly," replied Mrs. Graham. "And with much the same complexion of our old Florida nurse, Willie! Don't you remember Dinah Maria?" she asked, laughing. Willie remembered her, and how Annie used to vex her, by swimming out of her reach, when she took them to the margin of the bay to bathe, until at last it came to their father's   THE G RA    M S.   89 ear, and they were forbidden the salt water afterwards. Willie's friend was a botanist, and brought his herbarium with him for new specimens. So they made pleasant rambles to the woods for flowers, and sometimes had delightful sails on the river, and into a charming little cove which jutted far out into the land, the young men rowed the boat for water-lilies. The girls often went with them, and wanted nothing tofill the measure of their happiness but the presence of their brother Frank, who was not able to join therm. Before the departure of Lincoln, however, they made the excursion to West Point, and returned highly pleased with all they saw and heard there. Frank was overjoyed to see them, and they were treated by the officers with much attention and civility. As neither had ever before visited the Post, they found    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6495-00000048"/> 90     THE GRAHAMS. much to interest them, and came away with many pleasant recollections. After a stay of two weeks, the classmate went away to spend the remainder of the vaca- tion with his own mother and friends. "I cannot blame you-", he said to Willie the evening before his departure, after again urging him in vain to accompany him home! Nothing can make the city tolerable after such a charming taste of rural quiert and peace, but one's own home and friends. I shall often come back to you in spirit, chum, until we meet again in the old college cham- ber." When Willie's friend was gone they settled down more quietly to home confidences and heart communings. Mrs. Graham was pleased to discover that a year's absence had in no degree diminished her son's interest in the little every day affairs of the cottage. He had a thousand questions to ask, but with all   THE CR-AHAMS.       91 his inquisitiveness could not discover that anybody or anything had seriously suffered on his account. Annie had not overstated her musical pro- gress, and when some of the last year's com- positions were shown confidentially to her brother, he affirmed they were better than many of the articles that appeared in their Yale Monthly. "I shall do better than this by-and-by," she said, pleased with her brother's commenda- "tion, on the sincerity of which she knew she could depend! I want to write something grand-Willie! something to stir the hearts of men!" "Write from your own heart then, my dear sister! The gift of song, is a great gift; and if heaven bestows it upon you in any measure, consecrate it to a heavenly purpose. -I am sometimes afraid, Annie, you do not know much about experimental religion, though you 3    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6495-00000049"/> 92     THE GRAHAMS. are so generous and kind it hurts me to tell you so! but we ought to be faithful to one another when we are together." "I know I do not! and I thank you for telling me so too ;" she replied, with dewy eyes. "I am sensible of acting from very different motives from those I discover in mother and you, or even in Emily, who is a heavenly-minded child. I love my friends, and could lay down my life for them; but not as the Saviour laid down his-for a world that knew him not. I am selfish, even in the unselfishness which my friends give me credit for." "But you have a noble intellect, Annie, and might do so much good in the world. I have a higher ambition for you than you know of, dear sister." "' Tell me what it is, Willie?" "I That you turn many to righteousness."   / THE GRAiHAMS.       93 His conversations with Emily gave him much satisfaction. Already in her youthful soul he could discern the graces of the Holy Spirit; and he knew that the storms and tempests of life, however rudely they might assail her, could never disturb her everlasting peace. She was a gentle lily-like child of thirteen, with a certain sweetness of expres- sion and quiet simplicity of manner, sure to charm all who knew her. Like the spotless flower we' have just mentioned, she seemed to drink in from surrounding elements, only purity and sweetness. "She is just such a gentle little thing as a brother would love to carry in his arms through life, and shelter, and protect," Herbert Lincoln said to Willie one day, when they were speaking about her. But the two sisters-Annie with her native impulses and strength and lofty independence,    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6495-00000050"/> "    THE GRAHAMS. and Emily with her more clinging vine-like nature, were equally dear to the heart of Willie-and to each was their brother un. speakably dear.  .   CHAPTER X+ WILLIE went away in September, apparently benefitted by his longvacation. Thegirlspleaded so hard to go with him to New York and re- turn by the evening boat, that when their brother added his request to theirs, their mother consented, and went with them to the boat, and put them in charge of the Captain. I don't know what makes me have such peculiar feelings towards Willie?"-thought Mrs. Graham, as she satW him standing on the deck of the steamer between his two sis- ters, waving his hand toward her!"I am afraid I have my idols yet, and that they will have to be broken!" and as the mother    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6495-00000051"/> 96     THE GRAIIAMS. walked slowly back toward the deserted cot- tage, her thoughlts turned upon the uncertain nature of earthly joys. "I thougllt when my heart's great treasure was taken away from me this idol-worship was all destroyed; but my poor weak heart has been shrining new 'ones!' Such thoughts and musings filled her mind, while her chidren were enjoying the lovely sail down the river. She had time for secret meditation; and many of the silent hours of that day *vere spent by the pious mother in prayer for her beloved ones. Tea was all ready, and Mrs. Graham wait- ing when Annie and Emily returned. She heard. the sound of their happy voices as they drew near, and hastened into the porch to meet them. "O, mother! we have had such a pleasant time," both exclaimed at once--" and are now glad to get home again. We brought a great   THE GRAHAMS.       97 deal of love back to you from Willie, and more messages than we shall ever be likely to rememnber! Were you very lonely while we were gone?" Before their mother could reply, or bid them lay off their things and go to tea, they began again. "We saw three of Willie's classmates, mother. When we gotdown to the North River Pier, I suppose we began to look rather sober about parting with Willie. Just then, Captain Brown came to us, and said-"Your motheri charged me, young ladies, to keep you in sight. Now I think of riding over to the New Haven boat myself to see Master Willie safe aboard, and think you will have to go with me." Wasn't it just as kind as it could be, mother, when he knew how much we were wishing to go I'm afraid he heard us say something abot it on the way down.

Willie and all, and, as there was plenty of time, drove us round by the City Hall and Park. In front of the Astor Hou e, Willie exclaimed, ' There are our Philadelplhia boys, Captain, just getting into the coach! We shall meet them at the New Haven Pier.' Sure enough we did; and the first thing they said to brother Wilhe was something which will please you, mother.  ' Why, Graham, my dear fellow, is it you? You have been "picking up" wonderfully, boy! You are all right for another term at least.' Then another one said, ' He's good to lead all of us stout fellows 11ll warrant. Do be merciful, Graham, to Weaker intel- ligences.' Then they asked after Herbert Lincoln, and how long he stopped at the river; and said he was a right down good fellow. Willie brought them to the car- riage, and introduced them to Captain Brown and us.'   THE GRAHAMS.       99 "Yes, and one of them," added Emily roguishly, "was awful polite to Annie. The captain teased her about it coining up on the boat." -"I don't think he was extra polite," re- turned Annie, blushing slightly. "I didn't see him over ten minutes." "Show your basket of flowers, then, which you brought home so carefully, and which is now safe under your shawl! I should have thought it extra if it had been given to me, I tell you. There was a little girl on the wharf no larger than me, offering them for sale to every person who came by, and another little thing with a heavy basket of peaches and grapes.  Captain Brown bought some for us." Mrs. Gralam let the girls talk as much of the day as they wished, and took pleasure in listening to them, and watching their young radiant faces. They had not many holidays,    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6495-00000053"/> 100    THE GRAHAMS. and this one, she felt, had been allowed them more on Willie's account than their own; it was so hard to deny him   any thing. Their mother never regretted it. As long as the little green osier basket of verbenas and roses kept fresh and fragrant, the girls talked of their excursion down the river; and afterwards, like many another simple event in the life of every person, it became an epoch. The school in the village recommenced the next week. The boarders came back to Mrs. Graham's, and the girls doubled their diligence, striving to fulfil all their duties in a worthy manner. "The memory of our happy summer will last us through all the long cold winter," they often said to their mother. In all of Willie's letters was some allusion, showing that he also remembered the season with I ,   THRE GRA HAMS.      101 pleasure. Frank wrote often too, kindly and brotherly as ever, and no family ever seemed more harmoniously united, or more tenderly affectioned one toward another. 9*    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6495-00000054"/> CXHPTE R XI. E have a sadder chapter to write now--one which will make our young readers sorry, and which we would gladly have omitted. But when we take a pen to write a story of life, we must write it as it is, shadow and sun- shine mingled together, and not all sunshine, as we in our short-sightedness could wish. As clouds often come over the brightest morning, and as frost nips the sweetest and most cherished blossoms, so does the shadow of death fall upon the homes of the happy. Truly writes the poet- - "There is no flock, however watched and tended, But one dead lamb is there I There is no fireside, howsoe'er defended, But hath some vacant chair."   THE G 1AHAMS.      103 The world is filled with aching hearts. If we walk abroad in tlh street, or go to church, our eyes behold many mourners; and yet young persons are not apt to think much about it, until death comes to their own fire- side, and some friend is taken from them for ever. Willie Graham had been away for some lmonths before his friends at home had any intimation that he was not well. Then it was the merest hint by way of excuse for not coming to spend the winter holidays with them as anticipated. Hie had a slight cold, and was fearful of adding to it by exposure. This was all the letter said about it; but it contained many loving messages, and all the kind expression of the season of good wishes. His mother's fears were awakened, how- ever, and she directed a note of inquiry to his room-mate and friend, Herbert Lincoln, who informed her that Wilhe had only a cold, &amp;    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6495-00000055"/> 104    THE GRAHAMS. attended with slight prostration, and was able' to attend recitations regularly. He begged her to give herself no farther uneasiness, promising to watch over Willie like a bro. -ther, and make her acquainted with any change that might occur. He did not write again until March. Wilhe had written frequently in the mean time without mentioning his health, for which reason Annie and Emily were sure he was quite well again; and Herbert Lincoln had forgotten his promise. The letter proved it otherwise. "There really had been no change in his friend," he wrote. "He still attended to his studies, but his cough had not yielded to the customary remedies. He thought the change of a trip home would invigorate him, and a little of his mother's nursing cure him. Mrs. Graham wrote by the very next mail urging Willie to return nome, which he   THE GRAHAMS.       105 promised to do in a very few weeks. What they should do for him when he came, and what he would like best, was now the princi- pal talk at the cottage. Simple specifics were prepared beforehand, and delicacies calculated upon by the careful parent and affectionate sisters. There would be plenty of cresses in the spring brook, and tender asparagus in the garden, to tempt his appe- tite. He would not go back before autumn, they said to one another; and the strawher- ries and cherries, currants and gooseberries, would all ripen in time and do him good. Then they had plenty of milk and cream; and the boy who took care of the cow and did errands for them would sometimes bring him a trout, of which he was very fond. Many other plans were made for the beloved invalid, and his coming was looked forward to as the gladdest event of the season. He had not reached home on the first of    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6495-00000056"/> 106    THE GRAHAMS. May; and Mrs. Graham sat alone in her own room wondering what had detained him. The girls had gone with the school for flow- ers. She heard a footstep in the hall, and turning toward the door, which stood open, saw Willie's face looking smilingly in upon her. His eyes sparkled,. and his cheeks were rosier than ever in health. "My good mother," he exclaimed, folding his arms fondly around her!"you see I could not stay any longer away from you. Where are the girls?" She answered his question, but could not remove her eyes from his face. "Your cheeks are very red. Are you tired, my son?" "A little," he replied. "I walked up from the boat, and got out of breath. But don't look so worried, mother. I hope with this nice air to be soon as strong as ever." "God grant it, my dear boy," she replied,   THE GRAHAMS.      107 kissing his white forehead; then bade him rest, while she went to prepare for him some refreshment. The sound of his cough, as it came to her ear hard and hollow, seemed a knell of warn- ing to her fearful spirit. All the pleasant hopes she had been building ol Willie's re- turn were ready to fall at once and bury her in their ruin. She had scarcely strength to make ready his first meal. But when that first shock was over, she grew strong and hopeful again, and set herself to work with cheerful courage, not allowing her fears a moment's lodging-place in her mind. When the girls came ome from Maying, their mother's face was calm and undisturbed as when they left. Annie and Emily could see no danger and, felt nothing but joy in having Willie once more at home with them. Annie had had a cough as dry and as hard as his the winter    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6495-00000057"/> 108    THE GRAHAMS. before, she told him, but it had to yield to one of mother's syrups at last, and so would his. They had one all made and waiting for him. If the tenderest watchfulness and care ,! could have availed him, Willie Graham would have grown strong, when every thing in the world of nature without was budding into new life and freshness. He took short walks every day in the orchard, or on the river bank, attended by his sisters and old Sultan, who followed every movement of his as in the olden time. The girls said he re- membered all their old frolics. Willie even helped to plant their little flower garden, and took uncommon pains with Frank's circle; for Frank was at West Point no longer, but far away at the West on duty. Every exer- tion wearied him, however, and not one of the specifics had the anticipated effect. "I believe we had better consult a phy-   THE GRAHAMS.       109 sician," Mrs. Graham said at last. "There is Doctor Risley, a careful soul, who has known all of your constitutions for many years. Some of his simple prescriptions may do better for you than mine." Willie made no objection, and the doctor was sent for, and examined his patient with great interest and care. "I bopeiyou do not find Willie's a bad case," the mother said cheerfully, as she fol- lowed him to the door. "I want to hear you, say you can cure him at least." "You would not have me deceive you, my dear Madam," he replied; and before she could ask another question he was half w4a down to the gate. "Doctor Risley is very grim  to-day," Annie said impAiently, for she had been waiting in the parlor to hear his opinion. "He wants us to believe, when he has cured Willie, it was a work of great skill." 10    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6495-00000058"/> "O     THE G R HAMS. Mrs. Graham made no reply, for her heart was again heavy with apprehension. Willie occupied his mother's room, as more convenient and cool than his own little cham- ber, though that was unoccupied now; Mrs. Graham having decided to have no boarders while her son remained at home. She tried to appear as cheerful as usual that evening when she returned to him, but her voice trembled as she spoke. "What did the doctor say to you, Willie? I was out of the room until the moment of his departure." "Not much, mother. He has promised to give my case a careful consideration, and will then express his opinion of it." "I am afraid he exaggerates your symp- toms, allowing nothing for natural delicacy of constitution."  "Better to be honest with a patient than flatter and deceive one, mother. I would not   THE GRAHAMS.       11l be misled, however much I may wish to recover." Nothing farther was said that night, and when the physician came again, Willie re- quested to see him alone. They were a long time together, and his mother awaited the close of the interview in painful suspense. His sisters had as yet but vague suspicions of danger, and wondered what the doctor and Willie could find to talk about so long. The revelation of the truth was terrible to them. Doctor Risley stopped in the parlor on his way from Willie's room, and expressed a wish to consult with an eminent physician of New York city-one who had given nearly his whole attention to one branch of the medical science. He hoped Willie's case might not be as bad as it appeared to him. And that was all the encouragement -the doc- tor had for the loving ones who waited so anxiously for his words.    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6495-00000059"/> "2    THE GRAHAMS. "Procure all the counsel you wish, and the best you know of, my dear sir;" was Mrs. Graham's reply. "And, O doctor! if it lies in human skill, let my son not be taken from me!" Too much affected to reply,. the doctor bowed his head and went awaay in silence. "   CHAPTEJ    XIIXX OON   after the doctor left,. Willie ^c^  called his mother, and' met her sor- rowful look with a smile, which spoke of resignation and inward peace. "Doctor Risley is a good man, mother! He will tell the truth, however it may pain him to do so. I am very grateful to him for letting me see the worst features of my case." "He is going to bring a gentleman of larger experience, Willie, for counsel, and hopes it may not prove as bad as he fears," Mrs. Graham replied as calmly as possible. "Did you consent, mother? I was op- posed to it; for having entire confidence in Doctor Risley's skill and judgment, I thought 10*    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6495-00000060"/> "4    THE GRAHAMS. it would only be adding expense to no purpose." "Don't speak of that, my son. The little we have is nothing to me. But if I am be- reaved of my children, I am bereaved indeed. O Willie! what can your poor mother do but hope to the last?" "Pray, mother! you can still pray! You have been strengthened to bear one great affliction, and the same grace will still be sufficient for you. Pray for me too, my dear mother; for, were it not for my Heavenly Father's will, my heart would sink under this great disappointment. I have been looking forward to long years of life and useful- ness"-and his voice faltered as he spoke- "I had .ped, too, to have been one of the props of your old age, my poor mother. But if the oord will otherwise, we must submit." The physician from New York was waited for with much anxiety. But when he came, ' d   THE GRAHAMS.       115 he had no word of encouragement for Willie or his friends. "Disease has taken too fast hold," he said, " and the young man has not sufficient strength to warrant an attack upon it. He would be likely to perish in the first struggle." Dreadful words for those who had waited for them. as for oracles! All that remained for the loved ones was to smoothe darling Willie's passage to the grave. He was able for some time to walk in the garden, and breathe the perfume of the blos- soming orchard trees-hs face so serene and bright, as he talked with his mllother and sisters of the beauty and glory of God's uni- verse, Annie and Emily could not believe he was soon going away from  them to their Heavenly Father's house, of which he so often spoke. Emily could hardly be per- suaded from his presence for a moment. She followed his footsteps from room to room, and when he was weary or slept, sat by his side    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6495-00000061"/> "6    THE G RAHAMS. watching him in a manner very touching to behold. Annie so often gave way to her feelings ofk grief in his presence, that when she could find no more to do for his comfort, she would go to her own chamber to weep alone. Willie frequently conversed with her, and told her of the priceless worth of the Saviour to his soul, now when earthly hopes had failed him. Mrs. Graham, by constant struggle, main- tained her composure for the most part of the time, and was Willie's dearest comforter. Mr. Wood, their aged pastor, visited him often, and was astonished to find such heav- enly resignation in the heart of one so young. 'Your soul drinks at the clear water brooks, my son," he often said to him. "The path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day!" For a few days Willie seemed to have some secret anxiety, but it was understood at   \ THE GRAHAMS.      117 last. "If I could only see Frank once more," he said to his mother one evening as they sat by the window together, watching the pur- ple West. "I have written to him, my son, and just received an answer." "What did he say, mother?" "That he should be home within a month, if it cost him his commission." "Dear brother!" exclaimed Willie, with overpowering emotion, "Who ever had such friends as I? I am afraid I love my earthly home better than the home to which I am going." His mother could not reply, and Willie went on. "It would be an easier thing to go hence, mother, if it were not for these strong love- chords which bind us so to one another. Frank and Annie are in my mind continu- ally. I cannot feel so about you and dear    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6495-00000062"/> "8     THE GRAHAMS. little Emily here, who loves the Saviour bet- ter even than she loves her brother Willie, and will not fiet nor murmur because I go to him first. Will you, darling?" ", I cannot- bear it!-indeed I cannot!" was the sobbing reply. "I want to be good and submissive; but I have loved you so dearly, Willie, and so long-ever since I can remember." "My sweet sister!" he said, taking her to his weeping heart, and for a moment their tears flowed together; "I have loved you, too, Emily, better than I can tell you, and shall love you no less in our heavenly home, where we shall one day meet. Our dear father is there now, and I want to tell liim that all his children are following God in his and our mother's footsteps." As the weather grew warmer, contrary to their expectations, Willie grew weaker, and was soon confined to the=house. The sweet-   THE GRAHAMS.       19 est flowers of the garden were then brought by loving hands to his room every day, and his windows thrown up to let in the cheerful music of the singing birds. No other spot in the whole house seemed to possess any interest for any one; for where Wilhe was, the whole family clustered together. Even Sultan cared not to go abroad now, but lay a his young master's feet, or on the rug beside his bed continually, and no one had a heart to drive him away. Wilhe had many a caress for his old friend, and for Santa Anna too, who often came to purr and sleep by his side. But Willie grew worse and worse, and be- gan to have days of severe pain and suffering. The last of June was such an one. The morning was hot and sultry, and his cough much harder than it had been before. All day he labored for breath; and before even- ing, lay quite exhausted in Annie's arms. Every window was thrown wide open, but J,    <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6495-00000063"/> 120    THE GRAHAMS. there seemed to be no air any where. Annie had supported him hour after hour, and would not yield the place to any one; for his occasional "You do every thing just right for me, sister Annie," or "I love to have you near me, dear sister," nerved her for any exertion. Emily could fan him; his mother put his drinks and medicine to his lips; but only Annie's strong, arms could arrange his pillows, and raise and support him. "You must not do this to-night, Annie," he said, in a pleasant tone. "You must go away and leave me entirely, or you will be quite worn out." "When you sleep, I can sleep, too, with my head on your pillow, Willie. But I could not rest a moment to leave you with a stranger watcher." "Whose step is that, mother?" he in- quired, listening attentively. "It sounds like Frank's."   THE GRAHAMS.      121 "The doctor's, I think," Mrs. Graham re- plied. "Hte said he would be here again to-night." She went to the window, but seeing no one, concluded some neighbor had called, and went out through the hall into the par- lor opposite. A dark figure stood before her in the deeply shaded room. "Mother," whispered a well-known voice, "' dear mother, is it you? Speak and tell me how Willie is, my poor mother!"  And Frank put his arms around her neck, and waited for an answer. "A little more comfortable this evening; he has suffered dreadfully to-day, but patient- ly as a lamb. He heard your step in the walk, Frank, and knew it. I thought it was only the physician." "God bless him! my poor brother!' and Frank sat down and wept like a child for some minutes; then he rose resolutely and " *    <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6495-00000064"/> 122    THE GRAHAMS. said, "I want to see him, mother. Will it hurt him to have me go in upon him sud- denly " "Wait a moment, my son. I will go first." -Willie's eyes were turned toward the door with an expectant look, when his mother went back. She said to him pleasantly, "Your ears are better than your mother's, Willie." "It was he, then? I thought I knew that step. I must see him to-night, if he is not too tired," and his voice sank into a whisper. Frank, who had followed his mother into the hall, heard all but the last words. The next moment he was at Willie's bedside, and had his brother in his arms. Neither could speak for some time; and only the sobs of their two sisters broke the' silence of the room. Wilhe was the first to speak. "I was afraid I should not see you, Frank.   THE GRAHAMS.      123 I cannot tell you how glad I am, dear brother!" ' The world could not have prevented me from coning, Willie, when I heard you were sick. You need me to cheer you up, and make you well again." Willie smiled and replied faintly. I want just such strong brotherly arms as yours to rest in. Annie's have been my sup- port hitherto, but I have nearly exhausted her." Annie was not there to give the negative to his words. She had stolen softly away to give full vent to her bursting heart. "Frank and I can now take care of him to the last," she said; " and no stranger's hand will have to touch him. I could not bear to give him up to a hired watcher." That night she and Frank divided the care, after persuading their mother and Emily to retire to rest. Willie looked so contented,    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6495-00000065"/> 124     THE GRAHAMS. and smiled upon them in such a sweet, satis- fied way, and said he was so entirely com- fortable, whenever they asked him, that Frank could not believe he was going to die. But when he slept, and they marked his pale, sunken cheeks, heard his short, difficult breathing, and the unconscious moans of pain, despair fell upon Frank's hopes like a crush- ing burden. Wilhe had a great many things to say; and whenever he was able to talk, the voices of the two brothers were heard in low earn- est conversation. This continued for some days, until one morning, when Frank had gone out for a few moments' walk in the fresh air, Wilhe said to his mother, "lIe has promised me all that I wish. I shall die satisfied, for I know Frank will be a Chris- tian, if he is not one already." Willie lived only a week after this; but that last week seemed a lifetime to them all,   THE GRAHAMS.       125 in view of so much suffering and so much joy. Never have words of richer comfort fallen from the lips of the dying; never sweeter trust in the divine promises taken away the sting from death. As long as his tongue could articulate, some word of love was breathed into the ears of those who stood waiting around him. To each he had spoken his last wish; for each had breathed his last prayer. Every breath of theirs was now a prayer that he might be spared all farther suffering. His death at last was but a sweet going to sleep. He had passed through the gate. of pain, and the gate of immortality opened softly before him. "* \    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6495-00000066"/> CHAPTER XIII XXX T was a long time before the wheels of action could be brought to move in order again, and without a murmur. Willie's death seemed to take away all the freshness and beauty of life-all of its vigor and hopefulness. To mourners the whole earth often appears clad in a funeral garb; and so it was with them who stood gazing after their lost one through the medium of death's shadows.  "This is all wrong," Mrs. Graham said to her children one day, wiping the tears from her own eyes resolutely. "Grief was never intended to make us selfish. Willie's work is done; but the burden and the heat of the   T H E GRAH AMS.     . 127 day is, I trust, still before you. Frank must leave us soon, and go away again to his own duties, and we must stand up courageously to meet ours. When our Lord said to one whom he called, 'Let the dead bury their dead, but follow thou me,' he left an instruc- tive lesson of Christian duty in the day of affliction." It was the first time Frank's going away had been mentioned, though so often in the minds of them all. They knew it could not much longer be delayed, yet shrank from the very thought of afflicting one another by an allusion to it.  "I am glad you have the strength to show us our duties, mother," said"Frank in a grate- ful tone. ".I could not find courage myself to speak first of leaving you." "I knew you were thinking of us, my son," Mrs. Graham replied, smiling through her tears. "Your presence has been a bless-    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6495-00000067"/> 128    THE GRAHAMS. ing and a comfort to us, and to the dead too; but now we have all to gird ourselves for the. work of life anew. The girls must com- mence school again, and I shall have too many home cares to indulge in loneliness. I feel less anxiety for you now, my dear Frank, than ever in my life before, though you are going so far from us; for I know'that our God is your God, and that he will be to you 'a very present help' in every time of need." "He is my refuge and my fortress; my God in him will I trust!" replied Frank Graham-solemnly. "And, mother, my good brave mother, I no longer feel any hesitation about leaving you and my sisters. They could have no better guide-could find no one in the whole world stronger in faith and hope, and moral courage. Pray for your son, mother, that he too may fight manfully the good fight, and not fail of eternal life at last.   TI E GRAHAMS.       129 Frank went away the next week, and Annie and Emily returned to their school, chastened in spirit, but earnest and diligent still, in the pursuit of knowledge. Annie was learning other lessons beside; for her last promise to Wilhe had been to take the Sa- viour's yoke upon her, and learn of him who was meek and lowly in heart, and. his lessons were transforming her, by the renewing of her mind, to prove what is that acceptable will of God. Many letters of sympathy and condolence came to the stricken fanily from Willie's friends. The tenderest, most affecting of all was that from  Herbert Lincoln, who mourned for his beloved room- mate and friend as for a brother. He begged to be permitted to come sometimes to visit them, and stand with them by Willie's last resting- place. In the fullness of her heart, Mrs, Graham    <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6495-00000068"/> 130    THE GRAHAMS. wrote to him to come as her son's dearest friend, and be always assured of the kindest welcome. She told him with what a mourn- ful pleasure they recalled his last summer's visit, and how often Wilhe had spoken of it and of him in the last weeks of his life. That was the commencement of a corre- spondence which has lasted for many years. For now, when Annie has gone away to labor as a teacher, and with her pen, too, to write songs for both the sorrowing and the glad; and Frank is wearing his father's sword, and laboring faithfully in the service of his coun- try, while tending her flowers and assisting her mother in the care of the cottage, the little Emily still often fulfils her childhood's promise, and seals 1up her name for those who love her. But for none so often as for Frank and Annie, and Herbert Lincoln.     </p>
