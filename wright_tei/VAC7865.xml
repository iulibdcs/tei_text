"NDIA!" exclaimed Mark Sutherland, rising at the head of his table, and waving high the brimming glass, while his fine dark countenance lighted up with enthusiasm. A young Ajax in athletic beauty and strength, stood the Mississippian, until- "Indial" responded his friend Lauderdale, from the foot of the table. "India!" echoed the young men around the board, as they all arose, and, standing, honoured the toast. Then the glasses jingled merrily down upon the table, and then.-- "Now that in blind faith we have worshipped your goddess-who is India? Is it a woman or a quarter of the globe-your idolatry?" &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7865-00000005"/> 26   INDIA. TEE ,PEARL OF PEARL RIVYEl. "India!" ejaculated the young Southerner with fer- vor.

Fill high your glasses again, and  "Twixt the red wine and the chalice' let me breathe her beauty's name. Gentlemen, are you ready?-The Pearl of Pearl River!" "The Pearl of Pearl Riverl" responded Lauderdale. "The Pearl of Pearl Riverl" re-echoed all those gay youths, as this toast was also quaffed standing, and the empty glasses rattled down upon the table. This was the parting toast, and the company broke up/.o separate. The young guests all crowded around eir youthful host with adieus, regrets, congratula- tions, and kind wishes; for all these opposite phrases were equally appropriate, as win be seen. 'Mark Sutherland was the son and nephew of the celebrated Pearl River planters-the three brothers Sutherland. He was the prospective possessor of three immense estates-being the heir of the first, be- trothed to the heiress of the second, and co-heir with her to the third extensive plantation. He had just concluded a brilliant collegiate course with distin- guished honour; he was soon to return south, to enter upon his patrimony, and claim  the hand of   his affianced bride, before he set forth upon his Euro. pean travels. And? this was his valedictory enter-    l tainment, given to his classmates. For him, indeed-  \ "Filled was life's goblet to the brim!"   No wonder those fine strong eyes danced with an ticipation as he shook hands right and left. He was, up to this time, a frank, thoughtless, joyous, extrava- gant fellow-selfish because he knew nothing of sor- row, and wasteful because he knew nothbug of want Affluent in youth, health, and love-affluent in wealth, honour, and homage-he seemed to Consider gold valueless as 'dust, and deference only his just due, He " the heir of all the ages" past of-thought ardd toil, had entered upon -his intellectual inheritance with great eclat; but as yet not one mite had he added to the store; not one thought had he bestowed upon the great subjects that now engross all earnest minds. Too full of youthful fire, vitality, love, hope, and joy, for any grave thought or feeling to find room in his brain or heart, was the planter's son. How, indeed, could earnest thought find entrance through such a crowd of noisy joys to his heart? He stood upon the threshold of the past, indeed, and his face was set forward towards the future; but not one onward step had he taken. Why should he trouble himself? The bounteous future was advancing to him, smiling, and laden with all the riches of life and time. But he stood, receiving th adieus of his young friends, and dealing out wholeHe and retail invita- tions for all and each to come and visit hhtn,for an indefinite length of time, or until they were tired. At last they were all gone, except Lauderdale, his chum, who was passing some days with him, as his guest, at the Minerva House. "You are an enviable dog, Sutherland," exclaimed ,the latter, clapping him sharply upotn the shoulder. "You are a deuced enviable villain!

With no more com- fort or convenience in my life than can be enjoyed between my little back-chamber, up four pair of stairs in-a cheap boarding-house, and the straight-backed -lir and bhih-toonped desk of the law 4sop.

Would it were undonel But so it is; in some moment of ex- citement a-word passes our lips, and it is unrecallable forever.

But, rich, luxurious, and gorgeous, in its associations, too-(and that is why it was given to her) it suits her. She is India. Her mother was like her-a beautiful, passionate Havanienne, rich in genius, poetry, song-luxuriating in the beautiful creations   of others, yet far too indolent to create. More than all, she lost herself amid the oriental elysiums of Moore, and thence she named her only daughter Hinda. And as the maiden budded and bloomed into womanhood --well, yes, I believe, after all, it was I who softe'ed' aown her name to India. It has the same derivation, it is the same name, in fact; OhI and it suits her." "Describe your nonpareil to me." "I cannot. By my soul's idolatry, I cannot.  The best of beauty-the charm, the soul,the divine of beauty--can never be described or painted. It is spiritual, and can only be perceived." "Humph! is she fair?"  "No-yet radiant." "Dark?"

The latter part of this speech was addressed to Mr. Sutherland's valet, who had just entered. Flamingo was a character in his way; a handsome, bright mu- latto, with quite a " wealth" of bushy- black silky hair [ and whiskers. Very mercurial in temperament, and excessively fond of dress, he presented quite as gay and gorgeous an exterior as the famous feathered. biped, his namesake. Flamingo stood for a moment in a quandary, at the suddenness and novelty of the question put to him. "Oh, come, now; you are not poetically bewil- dered. Can't youi tell us the colour of the lady's hair?" "De colour o' Miss Inda's hair, sir-a-yes, sir- its-its-'bout de colour o' 'lasses taffy, when you're 'bout half done pullin' of it, an' it's shining."

Both young men were about to retire, when Suther- land again clasped the hand of his friend and said- "But you have not yet told me whether you will accompany me home. Come, laying all jesting and raillery aside, you know how happy I should be to have you." "And you know what I have told you before, my dear Sutherland, that I must go to New York for the ,anniversary week.

THE sun'shines on no more beautiful and entrancing region than the vale of Pearl river. It is the Elysium of the sunny south, reposing between the rich alluvial lands of the Mississippi, and the fragrant* pine forests of the Pascagoula. The green land of the valley seems to roll in gentle undulations, like the waves of a calm sea. Between the swelling hills, or rather waves of verdure, flow crystal streams towards the bosom of the Pearl. These lovely hills are capped * All who have travelled through or near the pine woods of Mississippi know the effect of the southern sun upon these trees, ripening and rare- fying from  them a most grateful and salubrious fragrance, called the : "terebinthine odour." The effect of the climate is still more obvious upon ornamental trees and flowers. Those that lose much of their luxuriant  } beauty and fragrance in the North, attain in the South their utmost per- . fection.  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7865-00000011"/> 88   INDIA.

These charming streams are shaded with the most fragrant and delightful of the flowering shrubs and vines. Here nature throws around her riches with an unsparing hand and a wonderful exuberance of luxury. Birds of the most brilliant plumage and enchanting melody fill all the summer groves, at early morn and eve, with their perfect music. Flowers of countless varieties, and most beautiful forms and hues, laden all the air with their ambrosial perfume. The breeze is charged with music and fragrance, as from the spicy groves of Araby the Blest. If in this garden-this conservatory of Nature, where all her choicest luxuries are assembled-there is one spot more favoured than all the rest, it is "Cash- mere," the beautiful seat of Clement Sutherland. The brothers Sutherland emigrated from the old dominion, and settled on the Pearl river, in those palmy days of cotton-planting, when every planter seemed a very Midas, turning all he touched to gold, and when the foundations were laid of some of the present enormous southern fortunes. It was no love  for the land of sun that brought thb Sutherlands there. They had heard that the common annual profits of the cotton crops were from ten to eighty thousand dollars, and they had sold their tobacco plantation on the Potomac, and emigrated to the valley of the Pearl. The spot selected by the brothers was that Eden of the valley where the Pearl river turns with a serpen- tine bend in the form of an S .with an additional curve, shaping the land into two round points to the west, and one-the largest and loveliest-to the east.    ! A SOUTHERN HOME.      3 The east point had been taken up by Clement Suther- land, the eldest of the brothers, and the west points by the two others. Thus Clement Sutherland's plan- tation lay embosomed between those of his brethren. On the upper side lay that of Mark, the secon brother, and on the lower, that of Paul, the third abfd bachelor brother, Very early in life, and some years previous to their emigration, Mark Sutherland had been united in marriage to a lady of St. Mary's-one of the noblest of Maryland's noble daughters. From her, their only son, Mark Sutherland, the younger, inherited a strong mind, warm heart, and high spirit; from his father he took the stalwart form, athletic strength, and .dark and sometimes terrible beauty, that marked the race of Sutherland.  Clement Sutherland had remained unmarried until long after his settlement upon the Pearl. But one  autumn, while on a visit to New Orleans, to negotiate the sale of his cotton, he chanced to meet a beautiful West Indian girl, whom he afterwards wooed and won for his bride. :Whether the sweet Havanienne, or the large fortune of which she was the sole heiress, was the object of his worship, was a mooted point by those who knew him best. It is probable he adored both. Certainly no slightest wish or whim of .the lovely Creole remained unsatisfied. It was she who - gave the charming scene of his home the appropriate :; name of Cashmere. She it was who persuaded him  - to pause in his incessant, exclusive thinking, talking, and acting, about cotton-ging, and his mad pur- suit of gain, to build and ador nelegant villa upon the site of the temporary fra e! house to which he &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7865-00000012"/> 40.

Her rare artistic taste presided over the arc tecture and embellishment of the mansion, and the laying out and ornamenting of the grounds. But here the evanescent energy of the indolent West Indian died out. She was, at best, but a lovely and fragile spring flower, that faded and fell ere the summer of Her life had come. She left a child of perfect beauty-a little girl,-who inherited her mother's graceful harmony of form and com- plexion, and her father's strength and vigour of con- stitution. Immediately after the death of her mother, the orphaned infant had been taken home by her aunt, Mrs. Mark Sutherland, to share the maternal cares bestowed upon her only son. The lady gave herself t^ up to the rearing and education of these children. And not the noble mother of the Gracchi was prouder of her "jewels" than Mrs. Sutheiland of hers. Thus the infancy and childhood of Mark and Hinda were passed together-the same mother's heart, the same : ..nursery, the same school-room, nay, the same book, C  with their heads together, and their black and golden locks mingled, were shared by the children. And no Guinea mice or turtle doves were ever fonder of each other than our boy and girl. It was a woful day when i they were first separated -Mark to enter college, and Hinda to be placed at a fashionable boarding-school. Tears fell on both sides, like spring showers. Young Mark, when laughed at for his girlish tears, angrily rejoined, that it was no shame to weep; that the renowned hero, Achilles, had wept when they took Briseis away from him, also when his friend Patroclus was slain.  X           A SOUTHERN HOME.       41 Paul Sutherland, the third brother, had remained up to the present time unmarried, with the determi- nation to continue so until the end of his life. He bestowed his affections with paternal pride and devo- tion upon his niece and nephew, resolving to make them his joint heirs, and with his own large property swell the enormous bulk of theirs. Just two years previous  to the opening of our story, the Pearl river trio had been broken by the death of Mark Suther- land, the elder. Young Sutherland had hastened home to console his widowed mother, but not long did the widow permit him to remain. The lady sent him back at the commencement of the next following term. But it is time to describe more, particularly Cash- mere, the charming seat of Clement Sutherland, and 3 the principal scene of our drama. The estate itself was a very extensive one, comprising several thou- sand acres of the richest land in the vale. That part of the plantation on which the villa had been erected lay in a bend of the Pearl river, surrounded on three 4 sides-north, east, and south-by its pellucid waters. The whole of this area is occupied by the mansion and ornamental grounds. The villa itself is a very elegant edifice of white freestone, fronting the river. The building is long and broad, in proportion to its height-this being the necessary plan of all southern mansions, to save them from the efects of the terrible tornadoes that sweep over the country, and to which a higher elevation would expose them. But the mansion is relieved from all appearance of heaviness, by a light and elegant Ionic colonnade, sustaining an open verandah ruxn-  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7865-00000013"/> ning around three sides of the building. On the fourth side, looking to the south the aspect is diver sified by a large bay window projecting from the lower story, and an elegant Venetian balcony from the upper one. The villa is also shaded on three sides-north, west, and south-by a grove of the most beautiful and fra. grant of the southern trees-the splendid tulip-poplar, lifting to the skies its slender Shaft, crested with elegantly-shaped leaves of the most brilliant and intense verdure, and crowned with its bell-shaped flowers of the most vivid and gorgeous flame colour; the beautiful cotton-wood tree, softly powdered over with its formless snowy blossoms; the queenly mag- nolia-grandiflora, with its glittering green foliage and dazzling white flowers and rich oppressive aroma;  - the pretty red-bud, with its umbrella-shaped top, its crumpled, heart-shaped leaves, and scarlet tufts; the bois-d'arc,fin full bloom, the most splendid and mag- nificent of ornamental trees, uniting the rarest quali- ties of the orange tree and the catalpa; the chinienne, with its vivid green foliage and brilliant purple flowers, dropping delicious but heavy narcotic odours, weigh- ing down the nerves and brain into luxurious repose, and stupefying the very birds that shelter in its aromatic shades, so that they may be taken captive with the bare han4; the imperial catalpa, sovereign of the grove by virtue of the grandeur and elegance of its form, the grace and beauty of its foliage, and the ambrosial perfume of its flowers, filling all the air around with its delightful fragrance; and many, many others, so various, beautiful, and aromatic, that one is lost and entranced amid the luxuriating wealth   ,I hi of the grove. Birds of the most splendid plumage and the most exquisite melody-the goldfinch, the i  oriole, the redbird, the paroquet, the nightingale, swallow, and innumerable others, shelter here, and their songs fill the air with music. No artificial walk disfigures the sward. The green and velvety turf affords the softest, coolest footing. Rustic seats of twisted bow-wood are under the trees; here and there fountains of crystal water leap, sparkle, and fall, ever playing silvery accompaniments to the song of birds; statues of Diana, Pan, and' the wood- nymphs, peopled the grove. Its shades are the de- lightful resort of the Sutherlands and their friends, to enjoy the freshness and brilliancy of the morning, to find shelter from the burning rays of the sun at noon, o dr t luxuriate in the delicious breeze of the evening. This Arcadian grove, as has been said, surrounded the house on three sides'north, west, and south. The east is the front of the house towards the river. The view here is open, and the most beautiful, charming, and variegated, to be imagined. From the colonnaded verandah a flight of broad marble steps lead to a terrace carpeted with grass, and planted with rose-bushes-fhe Damascus, the Pro- vence, the scarlet, the white, the multiflora, the moss rose; daily, monthly, and, perpetual roses; "roses- everywhere roses"-such a luxuriant exuberance of f roses upon this velvety terrace. The rose terrace is 4 divided from the lawn by a treillage of the most deli- \ cate and elaborate trellis-work; and this also is wreathed and festooned by running rose vines. Below this spreads the lawn on every side, not level, but gently waving, and covered with grass as soft, as s '   \  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7865-00000014"/> - .S^^.

The parterres are rich, beautiful, and fragrant beyond de- scription; there our hot-house plants bloom in the open air; and there our common garden flowers- violets, lilies, roses, myrtles, irises, and innumerable others--flourish with surpassing luxuriance. The t arbours, of delicate trellis-work and elegant form, are shaded and adorned with running vines of rich Arme- nean and cape jessamine, honeysuckles, and woodbine. The reservoirs coptain gold fish, and other ornamental specimens of the piscatorial kingdom. This extensive and beautiful lawn is surrounded by an iron open-work fencing, very light and elegant in appearance, yet very strong and impassable. Three ornamented gates relive the uniformity of this iron trellis; one on the north leads through to the orange groves, always inviting and delightful, whether in full bloom, and shedding ambrosial perfume in the spring, or laden with their golden fruit in the fall. The gate on the north admitted into the vineyard, where every variety of the finest and rarest grapes flourished'in luxuriant abundance. The one on the east is central between these two others, and leads from the lawn down to the white and pebbly beach of the Pearl, where pretty boats are always moored for the conve- nience of the rambler who might desire to cross the river. And then the curving river itself is well namoj the /     u    .     Pearl, from the soft, semi-transparent glow of roseate, whitish, or saffron tints, caught from the heavens. Across the soft water, in rich contrast, lie hills, and groves, and cotton-fields-the latter, one of the gayest features in southern scenery. They are sometimes a mile square. They are planted in straight rows, six feet apart; and the earth between them, of a rich Spanish-red colour, is kept entirely clean from weeds. The plants grow to the height of seven feet, and spread in full-leaved branches, bearing brilliant white and gold-hued flowers. When in full bloom, a cotton- field by itself is a gorgeous landscape. Beyond these X hills, and groves, and cotton fields, are other cotton- fields, and groves, and hills, extending on and on, until afar off they blend with the horizon, in soft, in- distinct hues, mingled together like the tints of the clouds. I have led you through the beautiful grounds im- mediately around and, in front of the villa; but behind the mansion, and back of the grove, there are gardens and orchards, and still other fields of cotton and out- houses, and offices, and the negro village called "The Quarters."  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7865-00000015"/> "   INDIA.

THE summer sun had just sunk below the horizon, leaving all the heavens suffused with a pale golden and roseate light, that falls softly on the semi-trans- parent waters of the Pearl, flowing serenely on be- tween its banks of undulating hills and dales, and green and purple lights and glooms. No jarring sight or sound breaks the voluptuous stillness of the scene and hour. The golden light has faded from the windows and balconies of the villa, and sunk with the sunken sun. tAn   evening  breeze is rising from the dis- tant pine-woods, that will soon tempt the inmates forth to enjoy its exhilarating and salubrious freshness and fragrance. But as yet all is quiet about the mansion. In the innermost sanctuary of tCat house reposes Miss Sutherland. It is the most eleg at of a sumptu. ous suit of apartments, upon which Mr. Sutherlafid had spared no amount of care or expense--having summoned from New Orleans a French artiste, of dis- tinguished genius in his profession, to -superintend their interior architecture, furnishing and adornment. The suit consists of a boudoir, two drawing-rooms, a BlI or picture gallery, a music room, a double   THE PLANTER'S DAUGHTER.      47 parlour, a library, and dining and breakfast rooms; and, by the machinery of grooved doors, all these splendid apartments may be thrown into one magnifi- cent saloon. But the most finished and perfect of the suite is the luxurious boudoir of India. It is a very bower of beauty and love, a chef d'oeuvre of artistic genius, a casket worthy to enshrine the Pearl of Pearl River. There she reposes in the recess of the bay window, "silk-curtained from the sun." This bay window is the only one in the apartment; it is both deep and lofty, and is a small room in itself. It is curtained off from the main apartment by drapery of purple damask satin, lined with gold-coloured silk, and fes- tooned :by gold cords and tassels. The interior of the recess is draped with thin gold-coloured silk alone; and the evening light, glowing through it, throws a warm, rich, lustrous atmosphere around the form of Oriental beauty, reposing on the silken couch in the recess. It is a rare type of beauty, not easy to realise by your imagination, blending the highest charms of the spiritual, the intellectual, and the sensual, in seeming perfect harmony; it is a costly type of beauty, pos- sessed often only at a fearful discount of happiness; it is a dangerous organisation, full of fatality to its 'possessor and all connected with her; for that lovely and voluptuous repose resembles the undisturbed serenity of the young leopardess, or the verdant and flowery suiface of the sleeping volcano. It is a richly and highly gifted nature, but one that, more than all others, requires in early youth the firm and steady guidance of the wise and good, and that -Lfif   &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7865-00000016"/> I   48   INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIV^E. needs the constant controlling influnce of Christian principle.            \ India Sutherland has never known another guide than her own good pleasure. "Queen o'er herself" she is not, indeed, unhappily; 'but queen instead over father and lover, friends, relatives, and servants. In truth hers is a gentle and graceful reign. It could not be otherwise, over subjects so devoted as hers. All of them, from Mr. Sutherland her father, down to "s. Oriole her bower-maid, deem it their best happiness to watch, anticipate, and prevent her wants; and she is pleased to repay such devotion with lovely smiles and loving words. She i.; indeed, the tamest as well as the most beautiful young leopardess that ever sheathed claws and teeth in the softest down. She is no hypo- crite; she is perfectly sincere; but her deepest nature is unawakened, undeveloped. She knows no more, no, nor as much, as you now do, of the latent strength, fire, and cruelty of those passions which' opposition might provoke. There she lay, as unconscious of the seeds of selfishness and tyranny as Nero was, when, at seventeen years of age, he burst into tears at sign- ing the first death-warrant. Awful spirits sleep in the vasty depths of our souls-awful in goodness or in evil--anrd vicissitudes are the Glendowers that can call them forth. There she lies, all unconscious of the coming struggle, " a perfect form in perfect rest." A rich dress of light material, yet dark and brilliant colours, flows gracefully around her beautiful figure. She reclines upon a crimson silken couch, her face slightly turned downwards, her head supported by her hand, and her eyes fixed upon a book that lies open upon the downy pillow; a profusion of smooth,   shining, amber-hued ringlets droop around her grace- ful Grecian head; her eyebrows are much darker, and are delicately pencilled; her eyelashes are also dark and long, and shade large eyes of the deepest blue; her complexion is very rich, of a clear warm brown, deepening into a crimson blush upon cheeks and lips the brighter and warmer now that the book beneath her eyes absorbs her quite. The light through the golden-hued drapery of the window pours a warm, subdued effulgence over the whole picture. On a cushion below her couch sits a little quadroon girl, of perfect beauty, fanning her mistress with a fan of ostrich plumes; and while she sways the graceful feathers to and fr , her da!k eyes, full of affection and innocent admiration, are fixed upon, the beautiful epicurienne. When the rising of the evening breeze began to swell the gold-hued curtains, Oriole dropped her fan, but continued to sit ald watch lovingly the features of her lady. When the purple shades of evening began to fall around, Oriole arose softly, and drew back the curtains on their golden wires, to let in more light and air, revealing the terrace, of roses, the lawn and its groves and reservoirs, and the' lovely rose and amber-clouded Pearl, rolling on between its banks of undulating light and shade; and giving to view, besides, the figure of a lady standing .upon the ter- race of roses, and who'immediately advanced smiling, and threw in a shower of rose-leaves over the recum-' bent reader, exclaiming-- "Will that wake you?

The speaker was a lady of about twenty-five years of age, of petite form, delicate features, dark and bril- liant complexion, and sprightly countenance, which owed its fascination to dazzling little teeth, and ripe lips bowed with archness, great sIprkling black eyes full of mischief, and jetty ringlets in whose very intri- cacies seemed to lurk a thousand innocent conspiracies. She was dressed in mourning, if that dress could be called mourning which consisted of a fine light black tissue over black silk, and a number of jet bracelets set in gold, that adorned the whitest, prettiest arms in the world, and a jet necklace that set off the white- ness of the prettiest throat and bosom.

I am sure that I shall never be able to do justice to the gentleman that was now seen advancing from the lawn-Mr. William I. Bolling, as he called himself; Billy Bolling, as he was called by his brothers-in-law; Bolling Billy, as called by his boon companions of the bowling alley; Uncle Billy, by the young people; Marse Billy, by the negroes; and Billy Bothsides, by everybody else. He was a short, fat, little gentleman, of about fifty years of age, and clothed in an imnmacu- late suit df white linen, with a fresh broad-brimmed straw hat, which as he walked he carried in one hand, while in the other he flourished out a perfumed linen handkerchief, with which he wiped his face and rubbed his head. His little head was covered with fine light hair, that did not shade, but curled itself tightly off from his round, rosy, good-natured face, full of cheer- fulness, candour, and conceit. The damper or the warmer the weather, or the more excited state of Uncle Billy's feelings, then the redder grew his face and the tighter curled off his flaxen hair. Mr. Bolling was one of those social and domestic ne'er-do-weels of which every large family connection may rue its specimen-one of those idle hangers-on to others, of which almost every southern house does penance with at least one. ITe was a brother of Mrs. Mark Sutherland, but no credit to his sister or their mutual family; though, to use his own qualifying style, neither was he any dishonour to them. He was a bachelor. He said it was by his own free election that he led a single life, thoulgh he vowed he very much preferred a married life; that nothing could be justly compared to the blessings of celibacy, except the beatitude of matrimony. -Hie compromised wit]    THE PLANTERK  DAUGHTiEK.     00 the Aeficiency of every other sort of importance by a large surplus of self-importance. He valued himself mostly upon what he called his cool blood, clear head, and perfect impartiality of judgment. He was not to be seduced by love or bribed by money to any, sort of partisanship. And as there are two sides to most questions under the sun, and as Mr. Bolling would look impartially upon positive and negative at once, so Billy "Won himself an everlasting name." He now came up to the bay window, wiping his face, and fanning himself, and saying- "Good evening, ladies I It is a perfectly delightful evening-though, to be sure, it is insufferably warm." Mrs. Vivian immediately challenged him with, "Mr. Bolling, we are anxious to know your opinion upon these lines of Pope;" and she read them to him, and put the book in his hands. He took it, and wiped his face, and fanned himself-but these cooling opera- tions seemed to heat him. all the more, for his face grew very red and his flaxen hair crisped tightly as he gazed upon the page, and said: "Eh, yes, that's all right-certainly!" "We believe it right, but what does it mean?" u"Mean! [Why, this is what it means- Bin-ding nature fast in fate, Left free the human will;' certainly--yes."

The child looked up in grateful affection; and the eyes of all the party were raised to welcome the orphan step- daughter of Mrs. Vivian. She was a fair, pale girl, of a gentle, thoughtful, pensive cast of countenance and style of beauty, with which her plain dress of deep mourning perfectly harmonized. "Come and sit by me, Rosalie, love," said the widow, making room for the maiden, half embracing her with one arm. The kind girl put an orange in the boy's hand, and, smiling, motioned'him away; and Fly, no longer mortified, but solaced and cheerful, ran off. "Now proceed, Mr. Bolling. Rosalie, dove, Mr. Bollin'g is explaining to us the two great motive powers of the universe; the centripetal, which he says means the law of the Lord, and the centrifugal, which he says means the temptation of the dwnon. And we, my love, are the planetary bodies, kept from extremes of good and evil by the opposite action of these two forces. Is not this it, Mr. Bolling?" "No, madam; no I no I no! Lord! Lord I Thus it is to expose one's theories, especially to Mrs. Vivian there, who would wrest the plainest text of Scripture to her own perdition. 'No, ma'am; I was about to say that the overruling will of Providence and the free agency of man were the two great motive powers of the moral universe-the human free will, being the great inward and impulsive force, is the centrifugal or flying-offpower, and the government of God the cen- tripetal or constraining power; that in the moral world these two great forces modify each other's action, just   as their prototypes do in the material world--keeping all in healthful action. Do you understand me?" "Do you understand yourself, Mr. Boilling?" "Ah, I see you don't-women seldom do!" said Unwle Billy, wiping his forehead. "Thus, then, were man without free will-without the power of workinog out his own salvation, or the privilege of sending himself to perdition, if he desired it--he would no - longer be a moral agent, and, were he never so sinless, ! he would be at the best only a sinless puppet, an automaton, and God's creation would be a dumb show. And, on' the other hand, were human free will left without restraint of the Lord's overruling government, why, man would rush into all sorts of extravagances, become a maniac, and convert God's order into chaos again. But, both these evil extremes being avoided, the Scylla of inert, passive obedience is left upon the right, and the Charybdis of unbridled license on the left, and all goes on well and harmoniously. And now: I hope you understand how it is that in 'binding ' nature fast in fate,' God still left free the humaI will." "No, I do not; it seems to me that we are' free, agents, or we are not free agents--one or the other." ' We're both, I assure you-both. Truth generally ! lies between extremes. I have known that all my life, and acted upon it. We are free agents, and we  i are not-that is to say, we are free agents within a certain limit, and no further. And observe, my dear - Mrs. Vivian, and my dear girls i within that limit we have still room enough to save or to lose our souls/" This speech was concluded with so much solemnity - of manner, that it imposed a silence on the little                  tF- i  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7865-00000021"/> ..... us jrxMiJU ' O fiPARL RIVER.   ! circle, that might have lasted much longer than it did, had Mr. Bolling been disposed to repose on his laurels. he was not. "Now, are you satisfied, madam?" he inquired of Mrs. Vivian. The little lady shook her jetty ringlets, and slowly picked her marabout fan to pieces. l "I think mamma wishes to know why these things need be so," said Rosalie. "My sweet Miss Vivian, little maidens Should be seen, and not heard." "Don't tempt Mr. Bolling beyond his depth, Rosa- lie," smiled the widow; and not suiting the action to the word, she handed Uncle Billy an orange she had just peeled. The little gentleman received the attention with a deprecating, humble ;bow, and, to prevent inconve- !ent questioning, turned to Miss Sutherland, and !I- nquired when she had heard from her cousin Mark winking with what he supposed to be a killing leer. The beauty slightly raised her lip and arched her brows, but deigned no other answer. "Oh, she has not heard from Mr. Sutherland for three whole days, and his'last letter was but twelve pages long. I am afraid he is fickle, like the rest. I should not wonder if he were now the humble servant of some northern blue  . It is written, 'put not your trust in'-pantaloons. Men are so uncertain," said Valeria. "Men are so uncertain! What men? Uncertain in what respect?" "All men are uncertain, in all thingsI!" "Humph, that is a  totally unfounded calumny on    our sex; though, to be candid, I acknowledge it is but too true of all men, without a single exception- save myselfl" "You? Oh, dear, oh! Ha! ha! ha! Youl" "Yes, me! In what did you ever find me uncer- tain?" "In what? Oh, heavens! he asks in what! Why, in all things---mental, moral, and physical! In reli- gion, politics, and morality! In friendship, love, and truth! In war, courtship, and money! In one word, you are a thorough, essential, organic uAcertainty. Other people are uncertain-you are uncertainty. I think, in the day of general doom, you will find yourself--nothing in nowhere!" Uncle Billy turned away from  this unmerciful philippic, and again asked Miss Sutherland if she had lately heard from her cousin. "I have not heard from him for two weeks," rea. plied the young lady, in a low voice, and without raising her eyes. "Nan, what would you give me for letter?" in- quired Mr. Bolling, rolling his little blue yes merrily, as he drew one from his pocket and laid it before her. ! "Oh, Mr. Bolling have you had this letter all this time, and detained it. from me?" said the beauty, re- proachfully, as she took it, and, excusing herself, withdrew into the house to peruse it. "Come, Rosalie, this night air is deadly to you, my child." "Oh, mamma, see, the full moon is just rising over those purple hills. I only want to see it reflected in . the river, and then I will come."          1 "Are you moon-struck, then, Rosalie? Come in; :i  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7865-00000022"/> OV   INDIA.

And the lady gave her hand to her step-daughter and assisted her to arise, and then tenderly drawing the girl's arm within her own, turned to lead her into the house. And Mr. Bolling lifted himself up, and picking up his straw hat, said-  "And I must go down to the cotton-mills, and make Clement Sutherland come home to his supper. Heigh-ho! it's an incontrovertible fact, that if I did not walk after that man and take care of him, he'd kill 'himself in the pursuit of gain in one month. Everything is forgotten-mental culture and bodily comfort. I have to bully him to his breakfast, and dragoon him to his dinner, and scare him to his sup- per. If things go on in this way, I shall have to cut up his food and place it to his lips. He is growing to be a monomaniac on the subject of money-getting. He is as thin as a whipping-post, and about as en-  livening to look upon.

He was gone, devil knows where, to inspect, devil knows what! He is the only southerner I ever did know to give himself up so entirely to the worship of Mammon, and the only one, I hope, I ever shall know!" And, having eased his mind by this fit of grum- bling, Uncle Billy waddled off on his benevolent errand to the mills. In the meantime Mrs. Vivian conducted her step- i daughter into the drawing-room communicating with  Miss Sutherland's boudoir. The room was now bril-  liiantly lighted up, but vacant of the family. The broad doors were slidden back into the walls, reveal-  ing the boudoir in its rich-toned gloom and gleam of purple and gold; and India herself, standing in thi ? midst, quite lost in thought, with one jewelled hand --  pressing back the amber ringlets from her forehead, and the other hanging down by her side, clasp'ig the ] letter of Mr. Sutherland. So deeply troubled and perplexed was her look, that Valeria impulsively sprang to her side, exclaiming, "What grieves you, *  my dearest India? No evil news, I trust?"    \ Miss Sutherland burst into tears, and silently handed H ner the letter.

"Woe to my lips that they should utter the charge. itt read his letter, Valeria, and advise me, for I am deeply distressed," said Miss Sutherland; and she hrew herself back into a cushioned chair, and bowed her face -upon her-hands, until all the amber ringlets drooped and veiled them. VaJria ran her eyes quickly over the letter, and then she threw herself into a chair-but it was to laulgh.. Miss Sutherland raised her head in silent sur- prise and displeasure. But still Valeria laughed, till the tears ran .down her cheeks, holding up .one hand in speechless deprecation, to implore forgiveness -for i mirth impossible to restrain.

G "Uncle, Uncle Clement what do you think has happened to Mark? Listen," exclaimed the vivacious lady, running off with the letter. Miss Sutherland sprang and caught her hand,' and, pale as death, cried out, "On your life, Valeria--on your soul You do not know my father; he abhors those sects with an exterminating fury of hatred! Give me the letter! Nay, now by your honour, Valeria I It was a sacred confidence. Give me the letter!" and she wrested the contended paper away from the giddy, laughing, little lady. "Heyday!

"Ah! Umph-hum! Yes! But now, my dear child, let me say one word. Young people are foolish, and need to be counselled by the wisdom of age. Observe, therefore, what I say, and be guided by my advice.

He strode into the midst of the circle, and standing be- fore his daughter, demanded in an authoritative tone, "Give me that letter, Miss Sutherland l"' She turned deadly pale, but without an instant's hesitation arose to her feet, placed the letter in her bosom, and stood fronting him. Seeing that the matter was about to take a very serious turn, Mrs. Vivian playfully interfered, by nestling her soft little hand into the great bony one of the planter, and saying, with her bewitching smile, Hi "uAh, then, Mr. Sutherland, let young people alone. \ Do not rifle a young girl's little mysteries.

They sat down to the t ble, and coffee and tea were served by waiters from the .sideboard. To dispel the last shades of suspicion and discontent from the mind of Mr. Sutherland, Mrs. Vivian remarked: ]"We are to have Mr. Mark Sutherland home in a very few days, if I understand aright. N'est ce pas, chre Indie?' Miss Sutherland only bowed, and the conversation turned upon their approaching voyage to Europe. CHAPTER   IV. MRS. SUT HZERLAND.

The homestead was the same that had been built by his father, upon first laying out the plantation. The house was very  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7865-00000026"/> 8   INDIA. TE PEAj OF PEARL RIVER. modest and unpretending-a moderate-sized, oblong building of two stories, painted light brown, with green shutters, and with piazzas surrounding both floors. The house was shaded and darkened by catalpa trees clustering thick about it and overhanging the roof. The pillars of the piazzas were thickly twined with running vines, that, branching and interlacing, formed a beautiful treillage of foliage and flowers. Doors from this piazza admitted directly into the rooms upon the first floor. In the right-hand front room, opening upon two sides into the piazza, upon the nex evening after the events related in the last chapter, sat Mrs. Sutherland. She was a medium- sized, full-formed brunette, of perhaps forty years of age; yet so perfect was her physical organization, and so well regulated her moral nature, so even, calm, and blameless had been the tenor of her life, that now, she was a specimen-not, certainly, of youthful beauty -but of a rarer kind of matured and perfected matronly beauty. Her style was noble and simple. Her rich, abundant hair of glossy black, with purplish light, was plainly divided above a broad forehead, and laying down upon the temples in heavy looped bands, was carried be- hind and twisted into a thick, richcoil, and wound round and round into a large knot fastened with pins; there were no combs, curls, ribbons, or fripperies of any sort, to mar the simple, grand beauty of the head. The eye- brows were black and lightly arched; the eyes large, dark, and very quiet, under their curtain of long black lashes; the nose perfectlright; and the cheeks, lips, and chine  y beautiful in contour. Her complexion as of that mellow, Italian brown, flush- ing and deepening in the cheeks to a carnation richness.   (Uncle Billy, who sincerely admired his sister, always said that her complexion ever reminded him of the bloom on a ripe, luscious peach.) Her dress was very simple-a black silk with a delicate lace collar pinned with a small diamond brooch. She sat in an easy chair, reading a letter; and as she read and turned the leaves a quiet smile would just dawn and play on her lips. By her side was a stand with an open book, a workbox, and a little silver hand-bell. At last, without removing her eyes from  the leter, she smilingly extended her hand, and rang the little bell. A servant entered, and still without withdrawing her eyes from the fascinating letter, she said: "Send Mrs. Jolly to me, William." The man withdrew with a bow, and the house- keeper entered, and awaited the commands of the lady. Slowly and smilingly folding up the letter, she said, "Mr. Sutherland is coming home this evening. He brings a friend, a young gentleman, with him. I wish you to have their chambers prepared; and do remem her to close the wire-gauze blinds, and burn catalpa leaves in the rooms, to destroy any mosquitoes that may remain." "And at what time shall I order supper, madam?" "Ah, yes--it will be necessary to put it back two or three hours. You must judge of that. Mr. Suther- land may arrive at any time between this and ten o'clock." The housekeeper left the room, and the lady sank into her chair again, to re-peruse her letter, smiling and murmuring to herself half aloud-"Dear boy! dearest Mark I Sure no mother ever had a son like I  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7865-00000027"/> 70   INDIA.

He shall find his India here." And she went to a writing-desk, took paper, and pen, and ink, and wrote the following note: SILENTSHADES, June, 184-. DEAR INDIA: My dear niece, but dearer daughter, just get into' your carriage, and come to me, and do not pause to wonder why I ask you.

So hasten, darling, to Your affectionate aunt and mother, HTLE N B. SUTHERLAND. Having sealed this letter, the lady rang the bell and gave it in charge of a footman, urging dispatch. Soon a waiter entered, and lighted up the rooms; and he had scarcely closed the blinds and withdrawn, before the sound of carriage-wheels was heard ap- proaching, and the lady hastened out into the hall. The carriage paused before the door, and in an instant after, Mark Sutherland had alighted, and was clasped to the booom of his mother. "Oh, my dear Mark! I am so overjoyed to -have you again i" "Dear mother, I am so proud and happy to find you looking so well! Permit me, to present my friend--Mr. Lincoln Lauderdale-Mrs. Sutherland." A low bow from the gentleman, and a deep courtesy   : MRS.

And with another smile she gave her hand to her guest, and permitted him to lead her into the drawing- roomn.    l Mr. Sutherland remained in the hall to give some directions to the grooms, and to order the baggage of his guest to be taken up to his chamber. After which he entered the parlour, and laying his hand affectionately upon his friend's shoulder, said- "My dear Lauderdale, when you feel disposed- or, rather, /f; you feel disposed-to change- your "dress--Flamring will show you your apartment.

"Well, now, although both of you are dark, with high complexions, I cannot see the likeness, to save my soul," said Lauderdale, mischievously; then ad- ding, " she is very handsome." "Is she not!" echoed Sutherland, with enthusiasm, and accompanying Lauderdale up stairs-" the hand- somest woman in the world? oh, except one. You ,should see India. And, more than that, she-my mother, I mean-is the most excellent, except- none." "I cannot think that she was so handsome in early youth as she is now."

And he would have clasped her form again, but with flushed cheek she glided out of his arms and entered the parlour. He followed her, placed an easy chair, seated her on it, rolled a cushion to her feet, untied and removed her bonnet, lifted the mass of shining amber ringlets and pressed them to his face, and then would have sunk down upon the cushion at her feet-there to sit and worship with his eyes her peerless beauty, only the sound of light footsteps and silvery laughter arrested the folly.

"I thought no one in his senses could apply that term to any woman but Miss Sutherland." "Who-;-the red-haired young lady?" "Red-haired/" burst out the voice of Sutherland, in indignant astonishment; then reining in his anger with a strong hand, he added, "Lincoln, you are my friend, but there are some provocations"- "Miss Sutherland is graceful," said Lauderdale, with a quiet smile. "Tah-tah-tah, with your faint praises; good-night." "Now, here is a reasonable man I When he thought me praising his love with great fervour, he was so jealous as to feel like running me through the heart; and now that he finds me very moderate in my admi- ration of his idol, he is angry enough to sweep my head off at a blow," said Lauderdale, laughing. "Good-night!" said Sutherland, to cover his con- fusion. "Stay, I can't let you go so; your lady-love is really lovely enough to turn all the heads and break all the hearts that approach her.

They sat now at the open window that looked out upon the beautiful valley of tht Pearl, with its groves and fields and streams all all fes and resplendent in the light of the newly-risen sun. The mother sighed deeply as she withdrew her glance from the gladdening scene, and fixed it upon the face of her son. "And so, Mark, this is the cause of your ill and anxious looks?" "Yes, mother; I will not deny to you that it has  cost me a very severe struggle; and perhaps you see some of its effects." "Yes, some of them, Mark-alas I not all," said the lady, in a low, faint voice.

"I cannot bear the name of that quarter of our country! the word strikes like a bullet, Mark!" ex- claimed the lady, with an impulsive start, and shrunk as if indeed she were shot. Mr. Sutherland looked down, mortified and troubled. "And as for this plan, Mark," proceeded the lady, "it must not be carried out.

How many times, when reading with her of some high heroism of the olden time, when there were heroes, have I seen her pause, her bosom heave, her cheek flush, her eye kindle and gaze upon me, expressing unspeakable admiration of those lofty deeds! And now, when in her own life an opportunity occurs of practising those very same great virtues-when she has the power, by sacrificing wealth and luxury, to bless hundreds of her fellow- beings, and not them only, but their children and children's children-do I not know that high-souled girl will aspire to do it! Madam, it is a majestic, a godlike power, to be able to confer the blessing of liberty and education upon hundreds of beings and their descendants to numberless generations-a power I would not now exchange for a small limited mo- narchy. And, oh! do I not know that my India- soul of my soul!-will think as I do-will feel as I do? Nay, do I not know that she will go beyond me? Mother, when I have doubted, or struggled against my better feelings, I have seen as in a vision, her eyes suffused with generous tears, 1i cheek kin- dle, and felt the warm pressure of her hand encour- aging, inspiring me!"

"No, dearest mother, that were too hard a trial to both of us. No, I mean to take her with me to the West, to encourage and assist me while I make her as happy as I possibly can!" Here, again, the lady's feelings arose to so high a pitch of excitement that she had to put a violent con- straint upon herself, while she answered quietly, "And how do you think Miss Sutherland will like to lay aside all the prestige of her rank, and wealth, and bridehood, and, instead of a splendid wedding, and a bridal tour, and a voyage to Europe, take an ignomi- nious departure from her father's house, for a life of poverty and privation in the West?" "I told you, dearest mother, that my India was of a highly heroic nature. That does not mean wedded to ease and worldly honour; indeed, it more fre- quently means the loss of both." "And so you deliberately mean to take that girl- if she will go with you-to some miserable western village, to endure all the miseries of poverty?' "What miseries of poverty, dearest mother? If you were a European talking of Europeans, I could understand your prudence; but you are an American matron talking to an American youth,.and advising him not to ntrry the girl he loves if he has not a for- tune to support her.

"His consent to our union was long ago obtained; and if, under present circumstances, he should with- draw it-India is of age, you know 1" "Mark, tell me if you have ever had any experi- mental knowledge of want?"The young man looked up with a questioning glance. "Because if you do not know, I can tell you, Mark. I know how young people think of poverty, and talk of poverty, when any strong motive like love, or any other passion, urges them to embrace it; and people who are older, and should know better, talk pretty much in the same way. They will tell you that poverty deprives you of none of the real essential blessings of life; that the riches of nature and of nature's God are free alike to the rich and the poor; that the blessings of health, of well-doing, of sunshine, and the face of nature, are open alike to both. It is so with the rich, doubtless, and it may be so with the poor who were born in this poverty; but to the well-born and well-educated, to the refined and intellectual, poverty is a dreadful, dreadful thing. It is not only to suffer the privation of proper and sufficient food, and comfortable clothing, and dwelling--it is to be shut out of 411 enjoyment of the blessings of nature and of society, and at the same time be exposed to all the evils that nature and society can inflict upon you.

And for society, pride will not permit you to seek the company of your sometime peers, and delicacy restrains you from the coarse association I  around you.

If the Sacred Writers will enter and take up their abode under my roof, if Milton will cross my threshold to sing to me of paradise, and Shakspeare to open to me the worlds of imagination and the workings of the human heart, and Franklin to enrich me with his practical wisdom, I shall not pine for want of intellectual companionship.'

Yet, even while he spoke, he became suddenly pale and aghast, as if, for the first time, the possibility that it might be otherwise had struck him. The lady had been pale and disturbed throughout the interview; and now she rose, and taking his hand, said-- "Mark, they have gone down to breakfast; we must go too. We will speak of this again. Mark, I should be in despair, if I did not hope that circlum- stances will compel you to abandon this insane purpose. When do you break-it to India?" "This day, motherl You have conjured up a phantom whose presence I would not endure for many hours. It must be exorcised by dear India forth- with." Mrs. Sutherland had two grounds of hope. The first was, that her son, restored to home associations and influences, might change his views and purposes before they should become known to his uncle. Upon this first hope she founded her purpose of preventing, as long as possible, Mark's intended communication to India. The second ground of hope was, that in the event of Mr. Sutherland's intentions becoming known, the powerful motives that would be brought to bear upon hm--the threatened loss of his uncle's favour, and of hS. promised bride's hand-might irresistibly impel him to renounce his project.

Her visitors, on leaving the table, had retired into the front room. Her fit of deep thought was interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Vivian from that front parlour. The "Iady gay" came in, trilling a lively opera air. Mrs. Sutherland arose, and took her hand with a very serious manner, saying- "My dear Valeria, who have you left in the other room?" "Mark and India," answered the little widow, raising her eyebrows with slight surprise. "No one else?" "No--yes--I do not know; I believe there is a waiter, or"-- "My dearest Valeria," said Mrs. Sutherland, draw- ing her to the opposite extremity of the room, " do me a favour; return to the room, and, not only while you remain here, but after you go back to Cashmere, prevent as long as possible any private conversation between those two young people; interrupt them; follow them; stay with them: circumvent them in every way."

Young people will not quarrel before others, any more than they will make love before them. There is a point of contro- I versy between Mark and India, and I do not wish them to have an opportunity of discussing it until both their heads are cool." "Ah, I think I know the point' of contention," said Valeria, with a bright look of sudden intelli- gence. "You?"' "Yes." !   And the thoughtless little lady, totally forgetful that the communication had been confidential, im- parted to her the contents of Mark's letter to India, and the indignation she had expressed at its con- tents, and the fear she had betrayed lest her father - and uncle should discover her lover's change of sen.- timents. Mrs. Sutherland heard the story with a thoughtful brow, and at its close, said- "And do you not think, Valeria, that the discussion of this lbject between them at present would end fatally Of ur hopes?"

"But you think that India will never yield to them?" "Never!" "And so think I. Yet Mark, dear, deluded child, would stake his soul on what he calls her heroism. Well, Valeria, now will you promise me to prevent an interview as long as you can, to give me an oppor tunity of trying to bring that poor boy to reason?" "Hal ha! ha! It is a thankless task, but I will undertake it. But you must give me an assistant, to relieve me sometimes, and to better insure the success of your enterprise.

"I am sure I do the very best J can for the dear girl; I take her out twice a day in the carriage; I never suffer her to go alone; she never has a bath until I dip the thermometer into it with my own hands, to regulate the temperature; she never puts on an article of clothing until I have ascertained it to be well aired; and she never even eats an orange until it has first passed through my fingers; and yet, with all my care, she droops and droops"-- "Like an over-nursed exotic.

She's Ihere" "So," thought Mrs. Vivian, "I have just got in time enough to hear for myself that my efforts to be useful and impertinent will be totally fruitless." In the meanwhile Uncle Billy had changed his dress, and had come down in a jacket and trousers of linen, white as "driven snow," and took his seat at the breakfast table. While she waited upon him, Mrs. Sutherland cautiously communicated the news that so burdened her mind. Gradually, as she. proceeded, the truth burst with he suddenness of a thunderbolt upon Uncle Billy,who dropped his roll and cup of coffee, turned pale, fell back in his chair, and gasped- "Good gracious 1" "Don't make a noise, brother, if you please. See, James is, coming with your eggs; wait until he has withdrawn," said the self-possessed Mrs. Sutherland; and then she directed the servant who came in to set down his salver, and leave the room. When he had gone, she turned again to her brother, and said- "Yes, this is true, and nothing remains now but to try to overrule his purpose, or at least to gain timed" "I- I am overwhelmed, prostrated, stunned with astonishment; though, to be sure, at my time of life, I am never the least surprised by any thing that hap- pens. -They are fools who at fifty wonder at any thing." Mrs. Sutherland then expressed a wish that her   brother would aid her designs, both by delaying the opportunity of an explanation between the young people, and also by using all his logical powers upon her son, to convert him from his purpose; for, strange as it may seem, Mrs. Sutherland had unbounded faith in Mr. Bolling's polemic abilities. His soi-disant im- partiality, coolness, and precision of judgment, had really imposed upon her. f   Uncle Billy dug both his hands in his pockets, and dropped his rosy chin upon his chest with an attitude and expression of deep cogitation, and his face quite i  flushed with the heat and burden of his thoughts. At last he said, with an air of great deliberation- "Hem! In the first place, we must essay every possible means of persuasion and coercion, to move   him from his purpose. Yes, persuasion and coercion I  of every possible kind and degree; for in this case   the end justifies the means."  "Yes, my dear brother, I agree with you perfectly; it is just what I said."

"Oh, certainly not," said Mrs. Sutherland. "No, no, I never could consent to that, although . would go to any justifiable or even unjustifiable lengths, to cure the boy of his folly.

I-though I confess I do not believe it will be in the power of mortal man to do it," said Mr. Bolling, rising from the table, and sauntering into the front parlour. He found Mrs. Vivian monopolising the attention of Mr. Sutherland, by making him translate for her a sonnet of Petrarch. As soon as Uncle Billy appeared, to relieve guard, Mrs. Vivian suddenly lost all interest in Italian, dropped her book, and left the room, pass- ing Mrs. Sutherland on her way, to whom she said, laughingly-- "A pretty commencement I have made of it I First, heard myself anathematised for a ' pestilent widow'- next made myself and three other people wretched for an hour-those were, Sutherland, who was dying to speak to India--Lauderdale, who was longing to talk to me--India, who wishes to listen to Sutherland --and last, not least, myself, who w'quite willing to hear what Lauderdale had to say "Mr. Lauderdale seemed quite-pleased with you last night."

If he does not, perhaps-he's only a college boy-I mean to make love to him, pour se disennuy&amp;e;" and waving her fan playfully, and half curtseying, the trifler glided off. And soon after she was seen promenading on the piazza with young Lauderdale. Ennuyee with the dolce far niente of the morning, Miss Sutherland ordered her carriage to return home.

Their way lay through a beautiful piece of woods,   that covered the hill, just rising, and then gradually i  declining to the river. They crossed by a ferry. -   This part of the river, being the head of the bend,   resembled a beautiful woodland lake, lying embosomed   among its green hills and' groves, which were all dis- ;  tinctly reflected in the water, that was flushed with a pale purple light, changing ever into azure or crim- son, or fading off into faint beautiful hues of pink or saffron. "Oh I it is well-named the Pearl-this lovely river --though it might as well be called the Opal," said ] Billy Bolling, who had a taste for natural beauty.    They were but few minutes in reaching the other bank of the river, and landing at Cashnere. Arrived at Cashmere, the party passed up the wind- ing road leading through the groves and shrubberies of the lawn, to the foot of the marble steps leading to the rose terrace, and there alighting, passed through the verandah into the house. Laughingly Mrs. Vivian took immediate posses- sion of Miss Sutherland, and carried her off to seek Rosalie. Mr. Sutherland, senior, happened to be in the house, and Mark immediately introduced his friend Lauder- dale. The old gentleman welcomed the stranger with the stately suavity habitual to men of his day and station; but he received hisinephew with an earnest- ness of affection scarcely restrained by the presence of a third party-pressing his hand with much warmth, and detaining it lingeringly in his clasp.  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7865-00000039"/> ":  INDIA.

Nay, more: he even felt a species of compunction for receiving his uncle's kindness under what he felt to be false colours; and he determined, if possible, not to let an hour pass before having a full explanation with him. And so, after the first compliments were over, and when the planter arose and politely excused himself, saying that important business called him over to his new plantation, and expressing a hope that Mr. La derdale would consider his house, servants, and sables, entirely at his commands, Mark Sutherland "d his hand solemnly upon his arm, and said- "My dear uncle, I must have a conversation with you this morning" "My dear Mark," said the old man, smiling-if it could be called a smile-"I know what you are about to ask, and I answer beforehand, just as soon as India pleases. The sooner the better. I speak freely before your friend"-bowing to the latter-" whom, I pre- sume, you have persuaded to do you the honour of attending you upon the occasion.

"My dear sir, it is upon another subject that I -really must consult you, at your very earliest conve- nience," said Mr. Sutherland, with such earnestness of manner Ps to enforce serious attention. "Well, sir," said the planter, "to-day you must really excuse me. I have to go over to the new planta- tion.

But, excuse me-young men know little and care less for the anxieties that make their   AIRS. SUTHERLAND.       95 elders slaves." And, smiling and bowing, the old- gentleman withdrew. And Mark Sutherland, seeing no opportunityof breaking his mind to either father or daughter for the present, invited Lauderdale for a ride over the plantation. Mr. Sutherland rang, and ordered horses, which were at the door in fifteen minutes, and he and his friend mounted and commenced their ride.  First winding round the shaded path at the foot of the rose terrace, they turned to the left, and entered the grove which surrounded three sides of the back of the house. Hal* a mile's ride through a narrow, tangled pathway, up which they were obliged to pro- ceed in Indian file, led them to an elevated clearing of about a hundred acres, on which was situated the negro village, called, in plantation parlance, "The Quarters." "There what do you think of that?" asked Mark Sutherland, with a slight dash of triumph in his tone, ; as they drew rein and paused under the shade of thio trees at the edge of the grove. Lauderdale's eyes were roving leisurely and lt'teh- tively over the woodland village. It was certainly a most lovely scene. The sky above was of the p]rilliant, intense blue of southern climes; the foliage of the woods around was of the vivid green of earl?'r summer. A few large% tces were left standing at interi als in the clearing; and under these, and scattered. G irregular distances through the area, were the neat w) e cottages with their red-painted doors. Each co(Vge had its small vegetable garden, and some fewr the better- kept houses had their fruit trees, a.d even flower  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7865-00000040"/> M9   INDIA.

Of these latter, some were seated upon the door-steps, and some were standing leaning over the fence-rails; some were occupied with knitting coarse stockings; and some, mostly men, were smok- ing their pipes. All the able-bodied men and women were out in the fields. Lauderdale looked on, first with an expression of surprise and pleasure, but afterwards with a counte- nance full of thought. "Well, my friend, how do you like that 7" repeated Mr. Sutherland. "I will give you my opinion more at large, later in the day, my dear Mark," replied Lauderdale; and then he added, "I have been told that you have the best stud and best stables in Mississippi; will you favour me with the sight of those also?" Mr. Sutherland immediately assented. THey turned their horses' heads, and taking another path, rode in a circuit around to the site of the stables, which lay a some distance to the right of the mansion house, andc were concealed from the latter by an intervening arm .f the grove. The stables were built in the most approv"ed modern style, with much architectural beauty, and possessed every requisite for the health and com:ort of the noble animals for whose accommo- dation ti'dy were designed. Here again Latiderdale expressed no opinion, but asked to see-don't start, super-refined reader-the pig pens. Mark, with a queer snile, cond cted his guest to the desired premises; and also, wi:hout'waiting to be solicited, introduced him to the Cow pens, the hen house, etc. All these -     buildings had been constructed under the direction of a celebrated English rural architect, and of course were fitted with every modern improvement for the well-being of the stock. Still Lauderdale ag yet re- served his judgment, while he expressed his thanks to his host for the privilege he had enjoyed. Sutherland mischievously asked him whether he would not also like to see the pigeon boxes before dinner. Lauder- dale smilingly declined, and they returned to the house. They alighted from their saddles and threw the reins to the groom, entered the hall, and separated to dress for dinner. room, Lauderdale advanced to his host, and said,- "Sutherland, I must thank you again for the sight of your plantation arrangements I and I must say that all your stock-horses, cows, and pigs, and slaves- are probably the best accommodated of any in the state!" Mark Sutherland, with a flushed brow, turned away. But in an instant, Lauderdale laid his hand upon his i arm, and said, with a voice and manner full of affec- tionate earnestness- "I mean to say just this, dear Mark--that your m negro village is comfortable, and even exceedingly beautiful, but that no amount of physical comfort can or ought to compensate an immortal being for the loss of liberty 1" The entrance of other members of the family and the speedy announcement of dinner ended this con. versation for the present.

After dinner, when he was about to seek an inter- I view with his betrothed, Mrs. Vivian forestalled him, by carrying off Miss Sutherland to examine a box of goods, lately arrived from New Orleans for the bride elect. And Mr. Bolling, leaving Sutherland, senior, to entertain the guest, ran his arm through that of Mark, and marched him off in triumph. "Well, Mark," he said, as soon as he had got him on to the lawn, "I cannot understand it! how a young man of your strength of character, of your firmness- nay, obstinacy; stubbornness-should permit yourself to fall a prey to these adventurers." "I really do not see how I am their prey, Uncle Billy, or why they should be adventurers." Oh, Mark, you are-I mean, dear Mark, you want experience of the world; and no amount of moral or intellectual excellence will stand you in stead for that. Nay, indeed, goodness will only make you the easier victim, and talent the more useful tool to these speculators."  - Uncle, you wrong them I By the honour of my soul, you do!

"Yes, and that's just what raises the hair of my head with wonder  Your good-humoured satire and gay indulgence used to please me so-much more than your uncle's haughty, scornful, persecuting resentment of these people's affronts.

And. now/ Ah, Mark, I call to mind the poet's line-. 'First endure, then pity, then embrace.' You began by enduring, and you end by embracing their doctrines. Ah, Mark Mark! Mark how came it so?" "Uncle, did you never hear of a gay man or woman of the world-well enough in their way--not sinners above all sinners, but with a certain light, satirical way of treating serious subjects, and a certain good- humoured contempt for those that entertained them- did you never hear an instance of such a man or woman going into a religious meeting to scoff, but returning home to pray? Well, very much akin to that was my experience. I went to the convention in New York, just to fulfil a promise made to my friend Lauderdale, and next to have a laugh at them I At the first meeting-well; I am not going to give you a report of it-sufficient is it to tell you that the sub. ject was presented to my mind in a new and startling aspect.

"At the second meeting, there were some still higher, purer spuls, and more eloquent and com- manding tong es; lips touched with fire, whose words were flame consuming the wrong principle, that shrivelled up before it. But I do not mean to become eloquent myself. This is not the time or place, nor are you the audience. It is enough to say that the speakers in that meeting gave me the heart- ache and the headache, and I wished in my soul I had never entered their hall. Yet nevertheless a fasina- tion drew me there the third evening. And then, whether 'the master minds' of the cause had said all they had  say for the time, or whether they had not yet arrived upon the scene of action, I really cannot say-(for the room was crowded, and not by friends of the cause, as you will hear, but by conspirators, who had come there to break the meeting up)-but certainly, after one short address of thrilling eloquence and power-during the progress of which I felt my- self to be a participant in an injustice, and at the close of which I was ready to make an irrevocable oath to clear my life from the sin-up jumps a fellow, with more zeal than knowledge, and more deviltry, I per- fectly believe, than either, and so defames me and my fellow-citizens of the South, a'nd so caricatures us as monsters of atrocity and so whirrs and rattles whips and chains and gyves about my ears and eyes, that it was the cast of a die whether I should laugh or swear.

And when I found myself, I was lying with a broken arm and broken head in the watchhouse!" "Good gracious, Mark! what a dishonour I What would my sister, what would my niece, say to that?" - "They do not know it, and they need not." "Well, really, one would have thought that would have cured you!" "My good uncle, it did-of indecision. One is very apt to be confirmed to a cause in which they have suffered somewhat. I lay very ill for two weeks. During that time I was ministered to by some ex- cellent men, and women also-persons whose disinter- estedness, benevolence, gentleness, and perfect sin- cerity, gave me such a deep and beautiful impression of the Christian character as I had never received from book or pulpit-persons who had sacrificed fortune, position, friendships-all, to a pure but despised cause. It was the silent influence, even more than the spoken words of these, which fixed me forever in my good purpose." "It may be true, Mark, that there are such, or it may only have seemed so to you.

"No, it is not so, nor could it be so; wisdom and goodness could not become the tools of selfishness and worldliness'." "Now, Mark, don't stand there and try to dazzle your old uncle's intellect, by a fine-sounding Joseph Surface sentiment You must either be a blockhead, or take me for one, when you pretend to tell me that the teachers of that party are not a set of self-seeking agitators, whose motives range from the mere getting of daily bread, up to the getting of political power; and who, if it fell easily in their way, would as will- ingly reach their ends by entering into the slave trade, as by agitating the question of emancipation." The hot blood crimsoned Mark Sutherland's brow, and he answered indignantly- - "You speak of that of which you know nothing. You speak of those whose" "Ah I don't I know  nothing?" interrupted Mr. Boiling.  "Where is that Mr. Grab, who came down here as a travelling preacher, and took that opportu- nity (or perhaps he was sent on purpose, and paid to do it) to preach abolition to the poor whites and the blacks, and to do Satan knows what other mischief; and the Lord knows what judgment would have fallen on him from our incensed planters, if he had not been offered an asylum in the house of your cousin, Mrs. Tilden, who, being a sentimental, compassionate young woman, and finding herself the protectress of a pale, persecuted young preacher, began to court him, as widows will court; and so, when all her brothers and brothers-in-law came in force to turn him out and   J'^ . .':'    MRS.

Umph, humph I we all understand that-in his case second thoughts paid better." During this speech, Mark had put down his anger, and now replied, gravely and earnestly- "Uncle, it is a point that I must meet--this of yours. It has given me much, deep pain. [But why should it make you scornful and incredulous of the disinterestedness of these reformers, or why should it give me sorrow? We must separate a high and pure cause, and its devoted self-sacrificing supporters, from its few unworthy advocates. Why, uncle, do we reject Christianity because among the Saviour's chosen twelve there was one Judas, who was covetous, and whose covetousness made him sell his master? Or because among His many disciples there were some who followed Him, hoping for high places in the kingdom they supposed Him about to establish on earth? Or, even now, do we all refuse to hear the Gospel preached, because there have been some most unworthy ministers in the pulpits? And shall we stop our ears, and close our eyes, and fold our hands before the cause of reform, for the reaop that there are some Grabs in the party? [Nay, God forbid '" Mark Sutherland paused as in painful thought some,  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7865-00000044"/> 104  INDIA.

Then, after a short pause, addressing his uncle again, and taking his hand, he said- "Uncle, I am about to sacrifice all I have in the world, to principles I have but so lately embraced. Well, sir, believe me, for it is God's holy truth-not- withstanding these Grabs who bring dishonour on their cause, there are hundreds of philanthropists who have sacrificed as much as I." "Indeed, indeed, Mark, you are very wrong and foolish to do this thing Very, very foolish and wrong, indeed. Nevertheless, I am constrained to say that you are perfectly wise and right in persevering in your duty! Yes, sir/" said Mr. Bothsides, wiping his face furiously, and stuffing his white handkerchief back in his pocket. "And now, what do you mean to do further?" he asked. "I shall go to the West." "Yes-yyes-yes-yes," said Uncle Billy, medita- tively; "do so.  Go to the West-go  to some new place, and grow up with it.

And I really think that with it you could not possibly go wrong," said Mr. Bolling, drawing his handkerchief from his pocket and wiping his forehead, and re placing it with a look of great self-complacency. "My dear Uncle Billy," said Mark, with a quiet smile, " believe me, I know how to appreciate your fine, impartial judgment, and feel convinced that I never should come to harm in following your ad- vice." With this proof of his high-minded nephew's af- fection and confidence, Mr. Bolling's blue eyes filled with tears, and he seized Mark's hand, and squeezed it, and shook it, crying- "Deuce fly away -with you, Markl I feel a perfect contempt for your folly and wrong-headedness in this matter-nevertheless-I am compelled to admit that I am filled with unmingled admiration for the wisdom and rectitude of your character and conductl Yes, sir/" ,This was said with great emphasis, and once more the cambric handkerchief was brought into violent requisition. An hour after the end of this conversation, Mark Sutherland was seated in the library, impatiently waiting the entrance of his uncle, with whom he had at last succeeded in appointing an interview. He waSi' anxious, restless, and unable to occupy himself with e. -' I  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7865-00000045"/> 106  INDIA.

He tumbled over the books, rumpled the papers, shifted his position many times, started up and paced the floor, looked out of all the windows in turn, and finally went to the door to listen, and reached it just as it was swung open in his face, and old Clement Sutherland entered. The planter walked to the centre of the room, and threw himself into his leather-covered chair at his writing-table, saying, in a curt voice-- "Well, sir, what is your business with me?" Startled by the unusual sternness of his manner, Mark Sutherland turned and looked at him inquir- ingly. The planter's countenance wore an aspect of severity that at once told his nephew that from some cause or by some means he had been led to suspect the: nature of the communication the latter was about to make him. "Will you oblige me, sir, by opening your business at once, as my time is somewhat valuable?" said Clement Sutherland, looking at his watch. The young man bowed, drew a chair to the opposite side of the table, took a seat, excused himself, and deprecated his uncle's displeasure for the painful sub- ject he was about to introduce. Here Clement Sutherland waved his hand im- patiently, begging that he would cut his introduction as short as possible. Then the young man commenced to relate the history of his life and experiences for the last pre- ceding three months; he told how he had been in- duced to attend the colonization meetings, first merely  in the spirit of bravado; how, in hearing the subject   MRS. SUTHERLAND.      107 freely and ably discussed, the conviction had forced ^ an entrance into his soul. Here Clement Sutherland wheeled his chair around^4 so that his back was presented to the light, and hise face cast into deep shadow, and from this instant to the end of the conversation, Mark Sutherland could not watch the expression of his countenance to judge his mental comments. But he went on to relate how long and stoutly he had struggled against this conviction; how at last it had overcome him; how his pride, his selfishness, his interests, his passions, and affections-all had yielded, or must yield in any conflict between them and his sense of duty. "Facts, s!I facts! Let us have no sentiments, no moral or metaphysical disquisitions, but actual facts I What do you intend to do?" Mark Sutherland answered, calmly- "To free every negro on my plantation, and at my own expense to send every one, who is willing to go, to Liberia." A scornful, most insulting laugh, was the only comment of the planter. "And after freeing them, I must do all in my power to place them in a situation of happier circumstances for their present, and more hopeful probabilities for their future, lives." The young man here paused, and asthe planter did not answer, silence ensued between them for several minutes, during which the latter passed his hand slowly back and forth over his bearded chin. At , length Mark Sutherland said, in a troubled voice- "I do not wish to conceal fom you, sir, the fact '  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7865-00000046"/> 108  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER, that my greatest trial ih this affair has been connected with the thought of India." i Again he paused for a reply or comment. But the phlanter only caressed his bristling chin, while his countenance was inscrutable in the deep shadow. The youth spoke again: "It has been a subject of deep regret and anxiety to me, to feel that I can no longer hope to offer India a fortune or a position equal to her just expectations. * For myself, I have no doubts or fears for the future. I feel within me a power to struggle and to conquer. I feel assured that within a very few years my. position will be a higher one than it is now, or than it would be were I to retain my present wealth. Ibelieve that my India will have no cause to blush for her husband, or you for your son-in-law." Still the old man did not make a single remark, and so deep remained his face in the shadow, that the youth could not read his thoughts. It was rather try- ing to continue speaking under these circumstances; but there was no alternative. He concluded by say- ing- "Although I have long enjoyed the pleasure of your approbation in my addresses to your daughter, I thought it proper to take the very earliest opportu- nity of informing you of my purposes, and the con- sequent change they must make in my fortune and circumstances. And now, sir, I have told you all, and I wait in much anxiety to hear what you have to say."-- "What do you wish me to say?" dryly inquired the planter. "Just what is on your mind, my uncle."   MRS.

It is true that a few words dropped by Mr. Bolling, and unex- pectedly overheard by myself, in some degree preparpe me for the strange communication you have just made. Still, it is    sudden, sir I It is sudden ' What, may I inquire, did you expect me to say? How did you anticipate that I should meet this.?" Mark Sutherland hesitated to reply, but got. up and walked the floor in an exceedingly troubled manner. A strange smile sat upon the face of the planter. At last he said- "You doubtless, and with much justice, expected me to withdraw my consent to the marriage of your- self and my daughter. Did you not? Reply, if you please." "Sir--my dear uncle l" said Mark, coming forward again, "I had my doubts and, misgivings about that. It would have been unjust to you to have seriously entertained them; and it would be unjust to myself to say that I did so." "You were right, sirl" said the planter, with the same inscrutable smile; " you were right--I shall not interfere. Having once sanctioned your addresses to my daughter, I shall not now oppose them. Miss Sutherland is of age.  I refer you solely to her. If, under the new aspect of affairs, she is willing that this engagement between you and herself shall stand, and that the preparations for marriage proc(ed, I shall throw no obstacles in your way.

Our interview is at an end, I believe?" The -words of Clement Sutherland would have called forth from his .nephew the warmest emotions and ex- pressions of-gratitude, but that the tone and the smile that accompanied them, more than neutralised their good effect, and sent a pang of terrible foreboding through the heart of the young man. "Pardon me, sir," he said, laying his hand gently and respectfully upon the arm of his uncle, as the latter was rising to leave the library. "Do I under- stand you to say that you approve"-- "You will please to understand me to say, sir, that I refer you to my daughter, Miss Sutherland, and that I shall endorse her decision, whatever that may be. Excuse me, sir-good afternooni" And Clement Sutherland, coldly bowing, left .the library. Mark Sutherland walked up and down the floor in great disturbance of mind, and then at last he seized :his hat and hurried from the room, to seek the pre- senee of India. k   OHAMBRE DE TOILETTE ET LA TROUSSEAU. ]]1 CHAPTER V.

This was addressed by Mrs. Vivian to her step- daughter, when, on entering the chamber of the latter, she found the young invalid reclining upon a couch, and reading, as usual. The fair girl closed her book, and smiling gently, arose, and passed her arm through that of her step- mother. And they left the chamber, crossed the hall,  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7865-00000048"/> Ads  N JLJL^ JL. 1A  1 ALUAIII1XU  VI1 ] J1- IKXi , opened an opposite door, and entered the dressing- room of Miss Sutherland.     ; A scene of splendid chaos met their view. Most of the boxes had been unpacked and taken away, and their brilliant contents littered chairs, couches, otto- mans, psyches, and even the carpet. And the favoured mistress of all this wealth sat in the midst of the re- splendent confusion, with an air of extreme languor and indifference. At her feet sat her beautiful hand- maiden, Oriole, with a box of white satin slippers by her side, and her mistress's small foot in her lap, fitting the fairy shoes. By her side stood her woman, Meda, holding a box of white kid gloves, from which she continued to hand out pair after pair to the young lady, who would draw one half upon her fingers, and then draw it off and let it fall, and drop her hand upon her lap with a look of extreme fatigue, as if the ex- ertion had really been too much for her, and say, lan- guidly- "There, take them away; they are all too large, or too small, or something" "Dear India, how can you say that?" said Mrs. Vivian, approaching, and taking up a pair of gloves; "they are all exactly of a size, and all number sixes -your number-and are really beautiful gloves." "But I'm so tired-it is such a bore. Oriole, cease tormenting my feet, and take away those odious slip- I pers." "'How can you call them odious-the beauties?" said Mrs. Vivian, stooping down, and taking up a pair.  And Oriole herself echoed the question with her    eyes, as she fondled her mistress's beautiful foot, in its case of white satin, soft and light as a snow-flake. "Oriole, did I not tel you to let my foot alone? Meda, clear away all th s chaos from around me. Rosalie, my'love, reach me the vinaigrette" "Can Ialso do anything to serve you?" asked Mrs. Vivian, mischievously. "Yes, dear Valeria; just see that they hang the dresses up, and put away the cases and things, while I close my eyes upon this glare, and rest." Mrs. Vivian arched her eyebrows, anid did as she was bid, examining at her leisure the magnificent trousseau, as it was detailed off under her eye into various wardrobes and bureaus. Only once she in- terrupted the repose of Miss Sutherland, to' ask her if the wedding-dress had come. "Meda, tell Mrs. Vivian about it," said the languid beauty, scarcely lifting her long lashes. And the waiting-woman respectfully telegraphed the lady, and preceded her into the adjoining chamber, where upon the bed was laid the magnificent bridal costume of white brocaded satin, the superb veil of Honiton lace, and the beautiful chaplet of orange flowers. Mrs. Vivian beckoned Rosalie, and when the child stood by her side, they examined it together, and the mother tried to make the daughter understand how elegant, how costly, how recherche was this costume. "And to think," she said, "that India is so indif- .ferent about a trousseau that would have turned my head when I was a girl. I don't believe it is indif- ference either; I believe it is affectation." "No, it is not, mamma.

She was not resting when she sat so still. I saw her lips tremble and her eyelids quiver." Mrs. Vivian cast a scrutinizing glance at the girl, thinking, "L How is it that in some things she is ob- servant?"But Rosalie, almost unconsciously, was repeating to herself the refrain of the song she had been reading:- "All that's bright must fade." "Rosalie, have done with that sentimental melan- choly; it disturbs me; and it is untrue, besides. The best things are most enduring. And it is all nonsense, besides, to suppose that anything more serious than indolence troubles India. And now, my dear, do you yknow the programme of these bridal festivities and tour, as we arranged it yesterday?" "No," said the young girl, trying to be interested. Mrs. Vivian dropped herself into an easy chair at the side of the bed, and Rose sank upon the cushion at her feet, and laid her head in the lady's lap; and and while Valeria ran her fingers caressingly through the soft ringlets of the. child, she said- "The marriage was long ago fixed to come off on Miss, Sutherland's birthday, and she and her friends see no reason to change it now.

"Dear mamma, how much you give up for me!" "My child, I would do anything in the world to see you restored to health and cheerfulness like other young girls." "But this, sweet mamma, is too much to sacrifice. It is too much for you to give up Saratoga and Na- hant, where you meet so many friends and admirers, and where you enjoy and adorn society so much. Mamma, do not think of giving this pleasure up, and burying yourselffor me in the pine woods. Let us go to Saratoga." "My love! I tell you the long, fatiguing journey, the crowded hotels, the execrable tables, the wretched attendance, and the noise and confusion, would kill' you, Rosalie!" "And then my sweet mamma would really be the rich young southern widow she is generally supposed to be," said the girl, gazing on her young step-mother with a fond, sorrowful smile. "Oh, Rosalie! why did you say that to me, love? Do you believe in the traditional selfishness of all step-mothers, from the days of Cinderella's step-dame to yours? Or have you read such poetry as- 'There's nothing true but heaven,' till you have lost faith in all things?-poetry that, Heaven knows, gives anything but 'Glory to God, and peace and good-will to man.'"

On our own plan- tation; in our own house at New Orleans; at our place in the pine woods; and while we are travelling, in steamboats, in hotels,-in short, wherever the great world that knows us Is entered." The lady looked so deeply distressed, and the maiden felt so grieved to see her troubled, that she hastened to turn the conversation, by saying, gaily-- "But, mamma, you did not finish telling me abo t our summer arrangements.

On her forehead sitteth pride, Crown'd with scorn, and falcon-eyed, Yet she beneath, methinks, doth twine Silken smiles that seem divine. Can such smiles be false and cold? Will she only wed for gold?"-Barry Cornwall. W-TTRF Mrs. Vivian sat talking with her daughter in the bed-chamber of Miss Sutherland, the latter re. mained in the adjoining dressing-room, where we left her seated in the easy chair, with her hands folded upon her lap, and her eyes closed as in gentle repose, only sometimes a half-smothered, shuddering sigh dis- turbed the statue-like stillness of her form. It was no deep sorrow, no great anxiety, that troubled this favourite of fortune--only, being quite unused to pain of any sort, physical or mental, she was impatient of its lightest touch. But she had that day been sum- moned to the presence of her father, and by him had been informed of Mr. Mark Sutherland's whole plan,   "OVE AND GOLD.       "L as he had just learned it from the latter. The planter had told his daughter, with distinct and dreadful de- r tail, of all the numerous privations, toils, hardships, and humiliations, and vaguely hinted at a countless variety of suffering she must endure, if she should become a party to her lover's purpose. He had fur- ther assured her, that if she should remain firm in opposing the plan of her lover, his resolution must finally yield to his affection for herself. And at last he had wrung from his daughter a promise, that she would make the total resignation of Mr. Mark Suther- land's plans the only chndition upon which their marriage should proceed. And so-the interview be- tween father and daughter had closed; and Miss Sutherland had returned to her room with little dis- position to be amused by the variety and splendour of her newly-arrived trousseau. And, by seeming lassitude and nonchalance, she had drawn upon her- self the unjust censure of Mrs. Vivian, and the won- dering compassion of the more sympathetic Rosalie. India never for an instant doubted her power over Mark Sutherland; nay, she never mentally even limited the extent of that power. The worst she anti- cipated was a controversy with her betrothed. That this controversy could end in any other manner than in her own favour, she never once inquired. That his fanaticism must yield to her influence, she felt certain. But she did not like to have to exert this influence. She admired and honoured Mark Sutherland above all men-nay, there were times when she feared him above all things. And she loved him as those of her clime only love. And with all her faults, this spoiled child of fortune was too true a woman to wish to take  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7865-00000052"/> 120  INDIA.

Nay, she felt indignant with all concerned in thrusting upon her such inevitable, yet such repul- sive, "greatness." And now she sat trying to com- pose her nerves and collect her' thoughts for the unavoidable interview to which she momentarily ex- pected to be summoned. She had not much longer to wait. A servant soon entered, and, bowing, informed her that Mr. Suther- land requested the favour of an interview at her earliest convenience, and desired to know when and where she would receive him. "Where is Mr. Sutherland?" inquired the young lady. "In the library, Miss." "Proceed thither and announce me, then." Arrived at the library, the man opened the door, and merely saying, "Miss Sutherland, sir," held it open until she had passed in, and then closing it, retired. And India ,found herself alone with Mark. He was sitting at- a central library-table, leaning with his head resting upon his hand; his face was very pale, his countenance haggard, his dark hair slightly dishevelled, his manner disturbed and anxious, yet withal controlled. He arose and advanced to 1-eet her, led her to a sofa, and placed himself beside her. Taking her hand in his own, and pressing it gently, he looked down into her face, regarding her with a grave, sweet, sad, almost solemn expression of counte- nance; and, after a brief pause, he said, "My dearest India, you cannot be at a loss to understand my mo- tive for requesting this interview?"   "OVE AND GOLD.       121 He paused, as expecting her assent, but she did not reply in any way. She did not even lift her glance from the carpet. He pressed her hand fondly, and resumed: "My love, the time has come, the opportlu- nity is presented for us-even for us, my India-to put in practice some of those high examples of hero- ism, which in others have so often won our fervent admiration. Even we, my India, may"- She arrested his serious words by suddenly drawing her hand away, and hurriedly exclaiming; "I have: heard something of your purpose of manumitting the people on your various plantations. But I would prefer to hear your plan of benevolence, or philan- thropy, whichever it may be, from your own lips, un- warped by prejudice, and uncoloured by passion, and with as little preface as possible " The coldness and reserve of her words and tones smote him to the heart. Nevertheless, he replied, "My purpose is no plan of benevolence or philan- thropy, my dear India, but a simple act of justice, originating in a simple impulse of conscientiousness." Then gently repossessing himself of her hand, he held it tenderly in his own, while he began, and, for the fourth time since his return home, related all the mental and moral experiences that had led him to determine upon the contemplated act of emancipation. She heard him out without again interrupting him. She sat very still, with her face pale and impassable, and her eyes cast down. She was no match for him in argument, yet, nevertheless, seeing that he silently awaited her answer, and preferring to convert rather than to cast him off, she recalled and repeated all the arguments she - had ever heard in defence of slavery; %S  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7865-00000053"/> L i ZaN 1JJN uA.

Was not their present subordinate position here infinitely preferable to their former savage and cannibal con- dition on the coast of Congo? Here at least they were Christianized. A smile dawned upon the young man's countenance. She saw and felt it. Her cheek flushed, and she hastened to say- "They must be blind indeed, Mr. Sutherland, who cannot see in the enslavement of the African race by the Anglo-Saxons the purpose of Divine Providence to civilize Africa." Mark Sutherland took her hand, and replied gently- "My dear India, we do not deny that God continu- ally brings good out of evil; but is that a justification of the evil? And even admitting, for argument's sake, that the reduction of a portion of the Ethiopian race to slavery by the Anglo-Americans is to be the means of Christianizing them, is it not full time, after two hundred years of bondage, that some of this harvest sowed with tears and blood should be reaped?-that some of these good fruits should begin to be enjoyed?" "Besides," said Miss Sutherland, eluding his ques- tion and evading his eye, "there is a fitness in these relations between the European and the African races -Europeans could not engage in agricultural labour under the burning heat of our Southern sun" "But why enslave the negroes-why not emancipate andtilre them?" interrupted Mark. A t   "O1 you know," she replied, hastily, "that the negroes will not work effectually, unless driven to it." "Plantation slaves will not, I grant you; but what has reduced them to this hopeless and inert con- dition?" "I do not know why you should call their condition hopeless-I think, upon the whole, they are at least as hopeful and as happy as poor white people, or free blacks. And I never heard of a bad master, who was not also a bad son, brother, husband, father, neighbour -in short, who was not a bad Christian. And if ydu feel a call to reform the world, Mark Sutherland, why not begin at the right end, and Christianize it-and all other reform will follow early, and as a matter of course. Why not do that?" "Because, my dear India, unluckily the world thinks itself already Christian. 'And if the light that is in it be darkness, how great is that darkness?' Neither, my dear girl, am I the missionary to dispel it. I am quite unworthy of, and unpretending to, the name of Christian, and have no presumption to begin- reform- ing the world, either at the right end or the wrong end. I only wish to do what I consider a simple act of justice, in a matter between me and my own con- science."' "I do not understand why your 'conscience' should meddle in the matter. The system appears to me to be perfectly right-every thing that we can wish. There is a beautiful adaptation in the mutual relations existing between the Anglo-Saxon master and the Ethiopian slave; for, observe, the Anglo-Saxon is highly intellectual, strong, proud, firm, self-willed, im- pelled to govern, gifted with great mental independ-. t !^  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7865-00000054"/> 124  INDIA.

"I think, my dearest girl, that even in that case the 'beautiful and happy correspondence' would be like Irish reciprocity-all on one side. Selfishness so blinds us, India" I have no space to dilate on what was said on either side. Both grew very serious, earnest, and emphatic. India became heated, fevered; she brought forward every plea she had ever heard pressed in favour of her own side of the controversy; but she was not his equal in logic. Baffled and disappointed in her failure, and unnerved by the strangeness of anxiety and con- tention, she suddenly burst into tears, and- passion- ately exclaimed- "You do not love me! You never loved mel You prefer the fancied welfare of these miserable negroes to my comfort and happiness 1" Mark Sutherland saw and felt only her tears and sorrow, and addressed himself to soothe her with all a lover's solicitude. She took advantage of his ten- derness-perhaps she even misunderstood it. She had failed to convince his judgment by her arguments, failed to change his purpose by opposition and re- proaches, and now she resolved to try the power of love-of persuasion. She let him draw her to his bosom; sle dropped her head upon his shoulder, with her- blushing, tearful face and soft hair against his cheek, her arm upon his neck, and half-caressing, suf-   "OVE AND GOLD.       125 fered herself to be caressed, and let him feel how sweet her love was, bytchA unutterable sweetness of her shy caress; and when  is heart was weak unto death, she pleaded with im, yieldingly, submissively, tearfully, as with one who had the right and the power ofcordering her destiny--that he would not doom her to a lot so cruel, so terrible; that she was so unpre- pared for it; that he must know she was; that it would kill her in a year. All this was pleaded with her head upon his shoulder, with her face against his cheek, with her hand pressed around his neck. This seductive gen- tleness was very hard to resist, indeed. He answered- "My dearest India, you are sole mistress of your own destiny, and, to a. great extent, of mine. I did hope that you would have borne me company in -my pilgrimage, and, even from the first, have shared my lot, hard as it is sure to be. We have both read and heard how women, even the most tenderly -reared and delicate, have, for affection, for constancy, for truth, and the great idea of duty, borne poverty, toil, hard- ships and privations, even with a better grace and with more fortitude and patience than the strongest men. But I begin to think that history and tradition must exaggerate. How, indeed, could my own fragile lady-love endure what my strong frame must encounter and overcome? No, dear India, ardently as I once desired that you should be, from this time forward, the partner of my lot, I see and feel that the wish was thoughtless, unreasonable, selfish. It was exact- ing far too much. No, dearest, painful 'as it must be to tear myself from you, I must go forth alone to do battle with an adverse fate.

I go forth with youth, and health, and strength; with a liberal education, and some talent; and when I have attained fame and fortune, then, like a true knight, I will come and lay them at my lady's feet, and claim-no, not claim--but sue for my blessed reward." She said that she could not let him go; it would break her heart to part with him. Could he leave her to break her heart? Would he not give up his purpose for her sake, and stay with her? Her head was still upon his shoulder, and her face against his cheek. With a slight movement, at once shy and fond, she pressed her lips to his neck, and repeated her question: Would he not give up his purpose for her sake, and stay with her? He felt his fortitude and strength fast leaving him. Amidst the fondest caresses, he said- "My own dear India! how have I merited such love? My India, I will not stay so'long as I said. I will not stay till I have won fame or fortune. I can- not remain away so long. But as soon as I have won a modest competence--in a year or two-I will be back to claim my blessing." Her tears fell like rain. Still she clasped, and pressed, and kissed his neck, and said that would not do at all; he must not leave her-no, not for a week; she could not, would not, bear it; she should die.  He kissed away her tears, fast as they fell,and then proposed again that she should go with him, promising to do more than man ever did, or even could do, to shield her from hardship till all hardship should be over, as it surely would be in time. With a few deep-drawn sighs, she lifted up her   "OVE AND GOLD.       : 7 head, and answered, No, she coild not go; she was far too delicate to bear such a change; he ought to- know it, and ought hot to ask it. No, if he loved her, he must give up his project, and stay with her; and if he did love her, he surely would do it. Any man that really loved would do that much for his lady. She was evidently merging from her tender, alluring mood, into an irritable and capricious one. Full of doubt and trouble at her words, he an- swered- "My dearest India, I told you that this purposed action of mine is a measure of conscience. You   - know it involves an immense sacrifice. Do you sup- pose that I would make that sacrifice, except from the - most righteous principles, and do you suppose I can possibly abandon such principles? My India, if from my great love for you I could now sacrifice my con- science to your convenience, you would soon lose all esteem for me, and, in losing all esteem, lose all com- - fort in loving me. My India, no honourable woman can continue to love a man who has forfeited his own and her respect. Do you not know that?" Coldly she put away his encircling arms-coldly she withdrew herself from him, saying- "I see how it is, sirl You do not love me; you are faithless; you seek an excuse to break with me, by putting our union upon conditions impossible for me to comply with. You need not have taken such a crooked path to a plain end, sir; you needed only to have frankly named your wish, to have had your plighted troth restored.

His brow crimsoned with the sudden smite of shame, and- "This from you, India!" he exclaimed. She was looking at him still; but the scorn and anger slowly passed from her face, as he rose and ad. vanced towards her, saying- "But you are excited; I will not lay your bitter words to heart, nor suffer you to leave me in anger. Dearest India!" She had already regretted her sharp words; love and anger were balanced in her bosom so evenly, that it took but a trifle to disturb the equilibrium; and now his forbearance and his kind words completely upset the scale, and love ascended. Turning to him once more, and throwing herself in his open arms, she burst into tears, and said- "Dearest Mark, only give up this mad, mad project, and I am all yours. Oh, you know I am, any way; for even now the separation that would pain you, would kill or madden mel But, oh you know I cannot endure the hardships you would prepare for me; they would be equally fatal.

The pleadings of young beauty to young love, most powerful, most painful to resist, yet they were resisted, mournfully, but calmly and firmly, resisted. She raised her head from his shoulder. "And you persist in your purpose?" she said. "My India, I cannot do otherwise." "Notwithstanding all the suffering you may cause your mother, your relatives, and me?" -"My own India, I would I could bear all your  grief in my own person."  "But you adhere to your resolution?"  "I have no alternative." "And this is your final decision?" He bowed. "Even if you should lose me for ever?" He started, as if suddenly struck by a bullet. He changed colour, but did not speak. She regarded him fixedly. At last she said, slowly and calmly- "Will you please to answer my question?" "India," he said, I will n+: for a moment, admit such a possibility. God will never repay fidelity to conscience with calamity." "Perhaps it might not be a calamity: I think it were well we should understand each other. The question is now before you-do not evade it." "My India, it is not practically before me. No, thank Heaven, the intolerable alternative of resigning you or my principles is not yet before me."

Never in all their lives had she seemed to him so beautiful, so regnant, so irresistibly attrac. tive. He gazed upon, he studied her face; nor did she turn it from him, nor avert her glance. She met his searching gaze proudly, fearlessly, imperially; she seemed to wish that he should read her soul, and know its immutable determination. There was no pique, no anger, no weakness, or wavering, on that high, haughty brow now; there was nothing but calm, indomitable resolution. He gazed upon he; in wonder, and in sorrow, some time fascinated by the imperious beauty of her young brow, and marvelling that this could be the tender, seductive woman that lay cooing on his bosom scarce an hour ago. It would not do to waver now. He took her hand again. He answered, solemnr- "India, you have adjured me, by my conscience, by the sacredness of my honour, to answer your ques- tion, and say whether, were the alternative finally before me, I should resign my resolution, or be re- signed by you. India, I may not, must not, evade this.

He received both pledges back, and stood with a certain mournful dignity, awaiting her further words and actions. "And now," she said, "let me make  you thoroughly acquainted with my thought upon this subject which so interests you, so that you may  see how far, as the East is from the West, is my thought from yours.

IT was over. Until this, he had not realized his true position. Nay, he did not fully realize it now. He sat, as one stunned, in the seat into which he had dropped when the door closed behind her. Until now, he had been elevated by a high enthusiasm in his purpose, and supported by a firm, faith in her sym- pathy and co-operation--a faith, the strength of which he had not known until it was stricken from him, and he was left weaker than a chrlld. Why! it really had not seemed so great a sacrifice to resign wealth and position with her by his side- with her approving looks, and smiles, and words-with her cordial, affectionate concurrence. And how often the picture had glowed before his imagination, as he recalled her kindling cheek, and kindling eye, and fervent imagination, while reading with him of some heroic deed of self-devotion in another/ And when he thought of all that earnest enthusiasm with himself for its object  forgive him, it was no better than a lover's aspiration, perhaps; but all his soul took fire 1  at her image, and all things seemed easy to do, to be, or to suffer, for such an unspeakable joy. That he   REACTON.         133 should be her Curtius, her Bayard, her Hampden, Sydney, her hero. And until now, he had believed this, and had lived and acted under a strange illusion. And if for an instant his faith in her sympathy had ever been shaken, it was merely as the Christian be- liever's trust is shaken, only to strike its roots the deeper after the jar. But now-ohl this was -indeed the bitterness of death! In the first stunned moment after his fall from such a height of confidence and joy, into such a depth of desolation and wretchedness, he could scarcely be- lieve in his misery, far less analyze it, and detect its hidden and bitterest element. And this was its -bit- terest element-the ascertained antagonism of his India-her utter antagonism! This was the weapon that had felled him to the earth. This was the fang of the adder, struck deep in his heart, and poisoning all his soul!-with what? With distrust!-distrust of her, of himself, of all men and women I As yet, all this he felt, without acknowledging, nay, without per- ceiving it. He sat there as one in a trance. And the hours that passed over him were as a blank. He was aroused by psychological disturbance. Why should he immolate himself upon the altar of a principle that one half of the Christian world would consider a mere madness? And how if, after all, it was madness? How if he was self-deceived?-actuated by fanaticism, and not by legitimate heroism? She whose whole soul had glowed at the mere mention of true magnanimity-she whose approbation had been the ardently desired reward of his sacrifice--the object of his young heart's passionate aspiration--how had she regarded him?

Not as he had often fondly prevised-not with a faithful, loving clasp, strengthening his hands-not with a fervent, inspiring gaze, imparting courage and energy to his soul-not with approval and sympathy, and faithful cordial con. currence, confirming his faith-arming him for any conflict-strengthening him for any sacrifice. Oh I no, no; far otherwise.

Was he a madman? Ohl there had been an element of worship and of aspiration in his love for India. And was this idol a mere stone, upon which he had broken himself in vain?

He was willing to believe himself a fool or a madman, so that her image remained undimmed, unspotted, unchanged in its shrine--so that she was still a perfect woman, angel, goddess I And was this not truly so?

Would it be so easy to step from his post, to abjure his principles, to silence his conscience? No! Even amid the intoxicating dream of his beautiful India's love, his stern soul answered, No I He knew that he had not taken a false position- the Tempter could not persuade him that he had done so. He knew himself to be right; he knew that he was not self-deceived. Not even now, in this hour of bitter trial, would his moral sense be so yonfused. In his conscience, the dividing line between right and wrong was too clearly, distinctly, sharply defined, and there was no possibility of confusing or mistaking the boundary. And so the mental sophistry of the temptation ended. And now for the moral conflict. Admitted that his convictions were those of pure rational duty, why should he sacrifice so much to them? Did others around him do so? Did any one live up to his or her high idea of right? On the contrary, who did not silence the voice f conscience every day of their lives? Who in this world was not, in their turn, and in their way, more or less unjust, selfish? And did they not, the best of them, compound for all this by going to church, and confessing themselves "lost and ruined sinners," and returning with a clean conscience, like a tablet newly sponged over, and prepared to be inscribed all over again with the same sins, to be effaced in the same manner?

His heart, it is true, had not been touched by the spirit of Christianity, yet his mind was too clear and right to deceive itself so delightfully about this matter. That grace of God which hath appeared unto all men, taught him that Christ was not the minister of sin--not one who gave out pa- tents conferring impunity in sin, and signed with his own life-blood-not one who wiped out the sins of the soul, as men sponge out marks from a note-book, to make room for more of the same sort of matter- not one to make his own righteousness the shield for our wilful unrighteousness. In a word, he felt and knew that Christ was not the minister of sin. This sorely tried and tempted man had made no professions, had used no cant, but he nevertheless pos- sessed a large portion of natural conscientiousness, and he had a frank, light-hearted manner of doing right, bordering on levity and nonchalance-a man- ner tending to mislead superficial observers into making too shallow an estimate of the depth and earnestness of his convictions and principles. All his family, from the cold-hearted, clear-headecd Clement Sutherland, down to the ardent and impul- sive India, had miscalculated the strength of his cha. racter and the firmness of his purpose. And hence the comparative indifference with which they had hitherto received the communication of his intentions. I say comparative indfference; for though indeed the family were much disturbed that he should for a mo. ment entertain such purposes as he had revealed, yet none of them had doubted that the influences which   REACTION.        137 should be'brought to bear upon him would compel him uo abandon his project. And thus agitation at this time was calmness, perfect halcyon peace, in com- parison with the confusion, the chaos, the tremendous storm of indignation, opposition, and persecution, that afterwards arose and hurtled around him. There are no wars so bloody as civil wars; there are no feuds so deadly as family feuds; there are no enemies so bitter, so cruel, so unrelenting, as those of our own blood, when they are enemies! Others may spare, but they will never spare! Others may in time be- come sated with vengeance, but they never! while their victim has one faculty of mind left uncrazed, or one heartstring unwrung. Others may in time be touched by some sense of justice; they never! they hold to and defend their cruelty. Others may repent; they never. It would seem that a fatal blindness of sight and hardness of heart fell upon them as a judg- ment from Heaven for their unnatural sin. Perhaps you think that the days of martyrdom have been passed ever since the stake and the faggot went into disrepute; and that the spirit of persecu- tion went out with the fires of Smithfield. If you do,  rhay you never have more reason for thinking other- wise than is contained in the simple narrative before you. I am not going to enter minutely into the de- tails of all the scenes that followed that last interview between Mark and India. I have all this time gone around and about the subject, fearing or disliking to approach it. In real life, evil, malignant passion is' not really the graceful and dignified and all but too  fascinating thing that we see it represented on the stage-for instance, in the toga and buskins of Brutus i  e        o  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7865-00000061"/> 1388  INDIA.

It is a humiliating fact, but it is a fact, that it looks and behaves very much more like an excited Terry or Judy at a fair. It shakes its fists, and strides, and vociferates, and chokes, and stutters. Fierce anger, hatred, and vengeance are of no rank. They show just as hideous, revolt- ing, and vulgar, in the prince or princess, as in the meanest peasant. And all this has been suggested by the recollection of the manner in which Mark Suther- land was treated by his family. He had made one more attempt to obtain another interview with India, by addressing to her a note. This note was returned, with the seal undisturbed, and with an insulting menace to the effect that any communication addressed by Mr. Mark Sutherland to Miss Sutherland must be preceded by a complete and final renunciation of his present purposes, before it could be received by her. Full of bitterness, -he wrote to her again, and concluded his note thus:- "I know you now, India; I know you perfectly. I no longer worship you. Alas! there is nothing in you to worship, or even to approve beyond your en- chanting beauty. And yet I love you still for that bewildering beauty and for the dream that is passing away. And you love me for something better. than that; you love me, now that for conscience I with- stand you, as you never loved me before. You wrong me in taking yourself away. You take from me mine own. There is a voice in your heart that assures you of this. But you stifle that voice. You outrage  i   REACTION.         189 Nature-but beware-! Be sure that Nature is a dread goddess, and Nemesis waits upon her bidding!" Thelre is something awful in the just anger of a noble-minded, pure-hearted, high-spirited man; and thrice awful is it to the woman who loves him, when that anger falls upon herself. India received this letter, and as she read it, bitter and scalding tears fell upon it. He had surmised the truth--she did love him now with ten-fold strength and fervour, now that she had tried and proved his strength. There was something in him to love, to lean upon, to worship-something far more reliable, more attractive, and more binding than mere masculine beauty --than the stately form, the dark, spirited countenance, and the fascinating gaiety, that had pleased her childish fancyv. There was firmness, courage, fortitude, moral strength; something that a true woman loves to rest upon, serve, adore. A wild and passionate longing seized her heart-to go and stand by him in his emergency-to help to sustain him, if it were ever so slight a help, in this storm of opposition. While the soul of India was convulsed in the terri- ble struggle between her strong and passionate affec- tion, and her invincible spirit of antagonism, Mark Sutherland lingered at Cashmere. The habit of con- sidering himself a son of the house could not easily be uprooted; and the absorption of all his thoughts and feelings in the subject of his broken relations with India, prevented him, for a time, from perceiving the cold and scornful demeanour of the master of the house. Had he not been totally abstracted in mind, he would not for an hour have borne the arrogance, which neither age nor relationship justified.  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7865-00000062"/> "O  INDIA. THE PEABRIOF PEARL RIVER. Miss Sutherland had perseveringly absented her. self from the drawing-room, and from the table-con- fining herself to her own room, and taking her meals there.                        1 At length one day, the family, as usual, with the exception of India, sat down to dinner. There were present Clement and Paul Sutherland, Mrs. Vivian,  Miss Vivian, Mr. Bolling, Mark, and Lincoln-a party of seven persons claiming to be refined women, or honorable men; in a word, ladies and gentlemen- enough, under any emergency, to preserve the decen- cies of a family dinner-table. Clement Sutherland, the host, sat with the usual cloud upon his brow. When the waiter was about to lift the cover from the dish before him, he arrested his act, by saying- "Stop, sir! where is Miss Sutherland? Go, and let her know that dinner waits." The man bowed and left the room. An embar- rassing pause and silence ensued, during which Cle- ment Sutherland sat back in his chair, with a scowl upon his yellow forehead, with an expression and an attitude that he doubtless supposed to be awfully tragic and imposing, and which, in truth, was inex- pressibly disagreeable, and even alarming; for all present felt that under all that ridiculous dramatic acting there was some real offence meant-some mean, J unmanly, inhospitable act to be perpetrated. In about ten minutes, the servant returned. Entering, and stepping lightly, he went up to his master's side, bowed, and in a low voice said-"Miss Sutherland, sir, has ordered me to say that she desires to be es- cused." And, with another bow, the waiter retired, and stood behind his master's chair. Clement Suther f   RBECTION.         141 land started up with an angry  esture, pushed his chair violently behind him, to the riSk of upsetting my gentleman-waiter, and exclaimed--"Sirs, I have to ask you if the laws of hospitality are to be so abused as to exile my daughter from the head of the table, and how long it is your pleasure that this state orfings shall continue?" THis explosion was just as shocking as though some- thing like it had not been expected. Mark Sutherland, with a crimsoned brow, arose from his chair.          - Lincoln, with perfect self-possession, deliberately arose, walked into the hall, took down his 'hat, re- -  turned, and, standing before Clement Sutherland, de- liberately said-"Mr. Sutherland, permit me to make a due acknowledgment of the hospitality you have ex- tended me, and also to express my regret ;that it has been so unpardonably trespassed against. J shall be most happy if you will afford me the opportunity to reciprocate the hospitality, and atone for the trespass. Good day, sir.    "Oh! young man, you have nothing to thank me for." -Bowing to the ladies present, Lincoln with- drew. Mark Sutherland snatched his hat, and, with- out a word of leave-taking, left the room. All the other members of the family circle remained seated at the table, with the exception of Miss Vivian, who, rising, excused herself, and retired. When Mark Sutherland reached the rose terrace,  It: he called to Lincoln to stop, and wait until their horses were saddled. And then he hastened off to the stables to give his orders. In a very short time the horses were brought up,  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7865-00000063"/> B12  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. and the young men mounted, and gallopped away from the house. They rode on in silence for some time--Lincoln buried in calm thought, and Mark enrapt in a sort of fierce reverie. At length he backed his horse close up to Lincoln's steed, seized his hand, and exclaimed, "Lauderdale, how can I ever atone for exposing you to such insult?" "Insult? My dear fellow"-(he was just about to say, "Mr. Clement Sutherland cannot insult me ;" but, delicate and generous in his consideration for the feelings of Mark, he only said)-" look into my face, and see if you think I am very much troubled." And, indeed, the pleasant countenance of the youth was well calculated to re-assure his friend.. They relapsed into silence as they approached the river. Sutherland was absorbed in mournful and bitter reverie, which Lauderdale forbore to break. They crossed the Pearl in perfect silence; Lincoln glancing from the beautiful semi-transparent river, with its surface softly flushed with rose and saffron clouds, to the gorgeous fields of cotton, with its myriads- beyond myriads of golden white flowers. When they left the ferry-boat, and cantered up the gradual ascent of the road, and entered upon the domain of Silentshade, once more Mark put out his hand and seized that of his friend, saying, "Here at last is my home, where I may welcome any friend of mine for any length of time; and I do not so much invite you, as I entreat you, to come and stay with me as long as you can give me your company, if it be only, defr Lincoln, to prove that you forgive me the offence that has been offered to you." "Pray say no more about it, dear Mr-k; how are   REACTION.        148 yoe responsible for an affront offered yourself as well as me? As for staying with you, I will do so with the greatest pleasure as long as I may." And once more Mark Sutherland fell into silence- into bitter and sorrowful meditation-into deep-de- spondency. Since India's haughty rejection of his hand, his life had grown very real to him. Before that, he had thought, spoken, and acted, as one under the influence of some inspiring dream. His anticipa. tion and appreciation of the trials that awaited, him, differed as much from the real experience of them as the imagining of some glorious martyrdom falls short of the suffering it. Young enthusiast that he was, he had thought only of the excitement and glory of the heroism, and not of the fierce torture and maddening shame of the sacri- fice. But now he felt his position in all its dreadful reality. And it was well that he should so feel it. It would test his sincerity, try his strength, prove his character. And now he rode on despairing, almost heart-broken. Yet even in this dark and clouded hour, one bright star of hope, and promise, and strength, shone on him-a mother's love-a mother's undying, unchanging love. It has been the theme of poets, of philosophers, and of novelists, since hearts I first beat with affections, and tongues first gave them utterance. It is the chosen Scripture illustration to express even the divine love of God. The young man rode along, deeply musing on that mother's love -deeply thirsting for it. He felt-man as he was- that it would be -a sweet and grateful relief to sit by her side, to drop his proud, but weary head upon her r shoulder, and for a little while to give vent to the  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7865-00000064"/> 6--&amp;o  J L .C.

JIJL flood of sorrow now stifled in his bosom-sure, that if others thought even such a transient yielding to grief unmanly, she, that tender and affectionate mo- ther, never would think so. And so he mused upon that love-the only earthly love that never faileth- that neither misfortune can abate, nor crime alienate. And, unfortunate and suffering in the cause of con- science as he was, how confidently he trusted in that mother's sympathy and support! Yea, though all other affection might fail him-though friends should forsake, and relatives abandon him, and even his bride discard him-she, his mother, would be true I He would have staked his salvation upon this, as they turned into the avenue of limes leading up to the house, and saw Mrs. Sutherland standing, smiling, upon the piazzi. But, on seeing the young men approach, in one instant, the lady's countenance changed. She had had her lesson. Without advancing one step to meet and welcome them, she allowed them, after dismounting from their horses, to walk quite up the steps, and to the very spot where she stood, and to bow and speak, before she relaxed one muscle of her countenance. She replied to their greeting in the coldest tones, inviting them to enter the house. For an instant, Mark and Lincoln raised their eyes to each other's face, and their glances met. A pang of mortification and disappointment sped through the heart of Sutherland; and Lauderdale, apparently not the least surprised or disconcerted, took his reso- lution.              1 \ Preceded by the lady, they entere o  se, and f   passed into a front parlour, and at her cold invitation, which seemed more like a strained and reluctant per- mission granted, they took seats. Nothing could be more deeply disagreeable and embarrassing than the next few minutes. Mrs. Sutherland took her sofa in perfect silence, turned her face towards them with a look of cold enquiry, and assumed the air of waiting to hear what might be their business with her-what they might have to communicate. This was very perplexing. They did not come on business-indeed, they were made to feel that they had no business there. They had come to be entertained, and comforted, and compensated, after the Clement Sutherland infliction. They had nothing particular to answer to that cold, questioning look, except Lau- derdale, who, cool as his own clime, informed Mrs. Sutherland that the day was "very fine." The lady bowed in silent assent. "The weather for many days past has been very pleasant," continued Lincoln, without the least em- barrassment. "Yes-I think the present state of the atmosphere highly favourable to travelling," said the lady. "Your climate here, madam, is not near so sultry as we of the North have supposed it to be," persevered Lincoln.  "Hem-yet at this season we think it too hot to be wholesome to you of the North," said the lady, with a curling lip.  "Humph," thought Lauderdale, "your courtesy, madam, is cold enough to cool the hottest hour of the -hottest day, in the hottest clime under the sun." But, turning to his friend Mark, ai4-            i 9  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7865-00000065"/> "6  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. "Sutherland, if madame will excuse us, will you be kind enough to let me have my room?" And Mark, released from the vice into ,which he had felt himself compressed for the last ten minutes, very gladly sprang up to accompany him. Lauder- dale bowed to Mrs. Sutherland, with some pardonable formality of ceremony, perhaps, as they left the parlour. When they had reached Lincoln's chamber, in the second story, Mark threw himself into a chair, and covered his face with his hands. Lincoln went calrhly to work, packing up his wardrobe. After a while, seeing that Sutherland kept 'his attitude of humilia- tion, he went up to him, clapped him upon the shoulder cheerfully, and said- "Never mind, my dear Mark I never mind 1 You take this to heart far more than necessary. Now, I dare say that one of your hoQt-bloodedt fire-eating Mississippians, treated as I have been, would call somebody out, and do something desperate; but I really do not feel obliged to do anything of the sort." "I am a Mississippian--do you consider me a very hot-blooded person? Am I not rather a miserable poltroon, to see my friend and guest outraged and in- sulted as you have been?" "Well, that is as fine a piece of self-accusation as I have met with since reading the formula of confession in a Roman Catholic missal. You could not help it, Mark-you could not affront age or womanhood, in my defence or your own," said Lauderdale; and he resumed his packing. In a very few minutes it was completed, and then  : *- .

He could not seek to change his guest's purpose-- could not ask him to remain; how could he do so, indeed? He wished to order the carriage, but- Lin- coln positively refused to avail himself of it, saying that he would walk to the next village, and send for his trunks. Mark impressed upon him the use of his own riding-horse, and Lincoln, to avoid wounding him, accepted it. The young men then went down stairs; Lincoln entered the parlour, to bid adieu to his hostess, and Mark left the house to order the horses, for he was resolved to accompany his friend. In a few minutes they were in their saddles, and on the road leading to C  , a muddy, miserable town,    J about five miles down the river. Here the friends finally separated, but not until Lincoln's trunks had been sent for, and had arrived, and Lincoln himself had entered the stage that passed through the village that night, and was to convey him  to the steamboat landing on the Mississippi, by which route he preferred to return north. They took leave with mutual assurance of remembrances, and promises of frequent correspondence. It was late at night when Mark Sutherland re- turned to his home, and he immediately went to his      room.  . s                 &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7865-00000066"/> "8  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. He arose the next morning, with the full determi.-  nation to set immediately to work. I must plunge myself into action, lest I wither by despair," might have been his thought. His mother received him at the breakfast table with coldness. He told her respectfully what he intead to do during the day. She curled her lip, and begged him to pro- ceed, without remorse or fear, to unroof the house that sheltered her head-and she trusted Heaven would give her strength to bear even that. After breakfast, he set out, and rode to Jackson, to engage the services of a lawyer to assist him in making out the deeds, and taking the legal measures required in emancipating his people. As the distance to the city was a full day's journey, and he had busi- ness enough to occupy the whole of the second day, he did not reach home until the evening of the third day. He came, accompanied by a lawyer. They were both tired and hungry, but found no supper prepared, and no one to make them welcome. Mr. Sutherland went out, and enquired for his mother, and was told that the lady desired to be excused from receiving an official, that had come to make her homeless. Mark stifled a sigh; he ordered refreshments for his guest, and soon after showed him to his sleeping chamber. The next day was a very busy, yet a very trying  one. On coming down into the breakfast-room, Mark Sutherland heard with poignant sorrow that his mo- ther had departed from the house, carrying with her many of her personal effects, as if for a long or per- manent absence, and had gone to take up her abode in Cashmere. In consternation at this act, Mark   Sutherland rushed out to institute further enquiries,  and found in front of the house a baggage-waggon, with Billy Bolling standing up' in the midst, receiving and packing away trunks, boxes, and packages, that were lifted to him by two negro men in attendance. "In the name of Hea^, what is the meaning of all this, uncle?" asked Mark with trepidation. Mr. Bolling stood up, took his handkerchief leisurely from his pocket, wiped his flushed, perspiring face, replaced it, and answered--  "It means, sir, that you have turned my sister out of doors; that is all it means."          p  "But, uncle, my dear mother has perfect" "D--n it, sir, don't call my sister mother, or me uncle You are no son or nephew of ours; we wash our hands of you I We cast you off I We'll have nothing to do with you I1' "Why, Mr. Bolling, what is the" "Confound it, sir, don't talk to me; you are a vil- lain, sir I James, drive on 1"And clapping his hat upon his bead, Mr. Bolling sat down and settled the last box in its place, and the waggon was driven off. It is impossible to describe the state of mind in which Mark Sutherland found himself. The distract- ing thoughts and emotions that whirled through his brain and heart, excited him almost to frenzy. He immediately wrote an imploring, passionate note to his mother, briefly alluding to the independence he intended to secure to her, and supplicating her to re- - turn to her bwn home. He sent it off; and, in a few minutes, unsatisfied with that note, he wrote another, more affectionate, more ardent, more supplicating, and despatched that also.  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7865-00000067"/> 150  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. And then, half-maddened as he was, he turned and set himself to his business. He caused all the ser. vants to be assembled on the lawn. He went out to them, and announced his intention of setting free, and sending all who were willing to go, to Liberia. He explained to them ,the goom that must accrue to the younger, and more intelligent and industrious among them, who might emigrate and settle in the last-named place. This news did not take the negroes the least by surprise. They had heard whisperings of the cause that had broken off their master's marriage, and set all his family and friends at feud with him. After closing his little speech to the. assembled slaves, he singled out some dozen among them--heads of cabin families-old and steady men; and he took them with him into his library, where he explained to them, at greater length, the advantages of the plan of emigra- tion to Liberia. And then he dismissed them, to con- verse with each other, to reflect, and decide what they wished to do. Next, he left his study to go and enquire if the messenger sent to his mother had returned. He found the man watching for him in the hall. He held a let- ter in his hand. Mr. Sutherland eagerly snatched it. It contained a few lines, formally advising him that no further communication would be received from him, which was not preceded by a full and complete renunciation of his obnoxious plans. While his gaze was painfully riveted upon this note, the second mes- senger arrived, bringing a letter in his hand. He selzed it. It was his own, returned unopened.

"I gave her the letter, sir; she took it, and read the direction, and handed it back to me, and told me to take it back to him who sent it, and not to bring her another one." "That will do-you Cay go," said Mark, and a spasm of pain twitched his countenance, as he tore up the letter, and threw the fragments away. "That is not all, sir-there is -something else." "Well, what new stab?" he thought; but he sai,--- "Well, what is it?" Flamingo took from under his arm a small packet, wrapped in tissue paper, and handed it to him. "What is this? Where did you get this?" "Miss Rosalie gave it to me to bring to you."  "You may go now," said Mr. Sutherland, as he opened a door, and passed into the parlrur, and sat down to look at the packet. It was a little morocco case, containing a lady's small pocket Bible, bound in white velvet and silver, with silver clasps. ain ele- gant little bijou it was. Upon the fly-lear was written, "Rosalie Vivian, from her affectionate and happy mother." And this writing bore a date of several years before. On the opposite page was inscribed, "Mark Suther- land, with the deep respect of Rosalie Viian." And this inscription bore the date of to-day. A leaf was folded  down, and when he opened it at the 27th Psalm, he   - saw marked this passage: "When my father and my/  mother forake me, then will the Lord take me up:  ' There was still another page turned down, and another - pencil stroke, enclosing these ,vords, (Mark x. 29,) l "And Jesus answered, and said, Verily, I say unto you, there is no man hath left home, or brethren, or  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7865-00000068"/> 152   INDIA.

He turned over the little book with a fond look and smile-partly given to the elegant little bijou itself, such an inappropriate sort of copy to be sent to a man-and partly to the fair, gentle girl, its donor. The little incident came to him like a soft, ericour- aging pressure of the hand, or a kind word at his greatest need--like a loving benediction. And for those blessed words that were marked, they were dropped into his broken and tearful heart, like good seeds into the ploughed and watered earth, to bring forth fruit in due season. He replaced the little book in its case, wrapped it again in its tissue paper, and, for the present, lodged it within the ample breast of his coat. He had never in his life heard Rosalie give expression to one fine heroic sentiment, such as fell plenteously from the lips of India, as the pearls and diamonds from the fairy favoured maiden of the child's story. But now he could not suppress the painful regret that the bril- liant and enthusiastic India had- not possessed more of the tenderness, sympathy, and real independence, found in the fragile, retired Rosalie. It were tedious, as needless, to follow Mr. Suther- land though all the multifarious and harassing de. tailsaf business that filled up the next few weeks. His path was full of difficulties. Not only social and domestic discouragements, and legal obstacles and ,4   REATION.         153 delays, but difficulties that arose on the part of the negroes themselves. A few of them did not want the old state of things, with its familiar associations, and, close attachments, broken up. Some of them, who were anxious to be free, had wives and children, or husbands, upon some neighbouring plantation, and so were held bound by their affections. Nay, indeed, often a mere fraternal love was sufficient to produce this effect. This class of negroes, proved to be a great trial and vexation to Mark, not only by throwaing nearly insurmountable obstacles in the way of their own emancipation, but also affording his opponents much material for laughter. It was in vain their benefactor told these men, that, after a few years of labour and saving, they would be able to purchase their wives or children. They shook their heads-- they feared-their spirits were too faint. As f*as his means would go, Mr. Sutherland purchased these wives or children, and sent them off with their hus- bands and fathers. At length, it was all over-the slaves were emanci-' - pated and gone, each with a sum of money to pay    " their transport, and provide their immediate necessi- ties, until they should find work. Many misgivings troubled the head of Mr. Sutherland, as to whether they would do well with the liberty, so unaccustomed, and so newly given; but no doubts as to the right. eousness of his own act ever crossed'his mind. And so he committed the result to Providence. He had taken care to secure the homestead to his mother. For her benefit, he had also placed at in- terest thirty thousand dollars, which, at six per cent., would yield her an income of eighteen hundred. ,  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7865-00000069"/> 154   INDIA. AE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. YHaving thus wound up his business, he went over to Cashmere to seek an interview--afarewell interview -with his mother and relatives. He learned that they had, a few days before, left Cashmere for the North. The next morning, Mark Sutherland, with only ninety dollars in his pocket-book, with his wardrobe and his law books, departed from his childhood's home. It may be as well to state here, that when the Sutherlands returned, in the autumn, Mrs. Suther- land, with some ten or twelve slaves, her own personal property, took up her abode at Silentshades, availed herself of the income her son had secured to her, and made herself comfortable. CHAPTER     VIl. i FAREWELL. "Fair wert thou in the dreams Of early life, thou land of glorious flowers, And summer winds, and low-toned silvery streams, Dim with the shadow of thy laurel bowers. "Fair wert thou, with the light On thy blue hills and sleepy waters east From purple skies, soft deepening into night, Yet slow as if each moment was their last Of glory waning fast!"- leman. THE sun was rising in cloudless- splendour, on the morning on which Mark Sutherland paused upon au   FAREWELL.         155 eminence, to throw a farewell glance over the beu- tiful scenes of his childhood and youth-the fair valley of the Pearl. East lay the dark boundary of the pine forest, pierced by the golden, arrow-like rays of the level sun, or casting long, spear-like shadows athwart Ahe green alluvion-south and west, belts of forest alternated with gaudy cotton-fields, and rolling green hills, interspersed with graceful groves, until in softly- blended hues they met the distant horizon. From this beautifully-variegated circumference, his eye re- turned to gaze upon the centre of the scene'-the Pearl-the lovely river which took its name from the somi-transparent hues of clouded saffron, rose, and azure, that seemed not only caught from the glorious sky above, and, the gorgeous hills, and fields, and grove, around, but flashed up from the deep channel of the stream, as if its clear waters flowed through a bed of opal. At some distance below him, encircled by a-bead of the river, lay-like some rich mosaic on the bosom of the vale-"Cashmere," the almost Oriental scene of his youthful love-dream. There was the pebbly beach, with its miniature piers and fairy boats--the lawn, with its flowering and fragrant groves, its crystal founts, its shaded walks and vine-clad -arbours; and, nearer the house, the rose terrace, with its millions of odoriferous budding and blooming roses, surrounding as within a crimson glow, that white villa and its colonnade of light Ionic shafts. At this distance, he could see distinctly the bay window, with its purple curtains, of India's boudoir; and, at its sight, the image of the beautiful India arose before him. Again he saw her in that poetic harmony of form and colour-.-  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7865-00000070"/> 156  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. ing that had so ravished his artist soul--the slender, yet well-rounded figure--the warm, bright counte- nance, with its amber-hued ringlets, and clear olive complexion deepening into crimson upon cheeks and lips-a beauty in which there was no strong contrast, but all rich harmony-a form that he once had fondly thought clothed a soul as harmonious as beautiful. They were lost I all lost-home, and bride, and lovely dreams of youth I Do not despise him, or blame him, when I tell you, in. the touching words of Scripture, "that he lifted up his voice and wept." He was but twenty-one, and this was the first despairing passionate sorrow of his youth. It is very easy to talk and write of the " rewards of virtue," the comfort of a good conscience, the de- lights of duty. Alas 1 I am afraid the delights of duty are seldom believed in, and seldomer experienced. Be sure, when a great sacrifice of interest, of affection, of hope, is made, and a great sorrow is felt-nothing nothing but a loving, Christian faith-can console. And Mark Sutherland was not a Christian man. Here, then, even a philanthropist might reasonably inquire why all this was done? Why a youth, born and brought up a slaveholder, should, against precon- ceived ideas, against prudence, against self-interest, against hope, with doubtful good even to the benefi- ciaries of his self-detotion, beggar himself for the sake of their emancipation? Why he, being no Christian, should make such an immense sacrifice of wealth, position, affection, hope-in short, of all tem- poral and earthly interests? We are all -able to answer, that, had a scientific phrenologist examined the moral organs of Mark   FAREWELL.         157 Sutherland's head, he would have found his answer in the predominant CONSCIENTIOUSNESS. It was, there- fore. only a severe sense of justice that laid its iron hand upon him, obliging him to do as he had done- a single sense of justice, such as might have influenced the actions of a Pagan or an Atheist--a hard, stern sense of justice, without faith, hope, or love-an un- compromising sense of justice, without self-flattery, promise, or comfort. He is not as yet a Christian, but he may become one, he must become one, for no great sacrifice was ever made to duty, without Christ claiming that re- deemed soul as his own. After all, perhaps, there is but one sin and sorrow in the world-IDOLATRY--and all forms of evil are compromised within it. It includes all shades of sin, from the lightest error that clouds the conscience, to the darkest crime that brings endless night upon the ' soul; and all degrees of suffering, from the discontent that disturbs the passing hour, to the anguish and despair that overwhelms and swallows up all the hopes of life. We are all idolaters. Some god-pas-  sion of the heart is ever the deity we worship. Am-  i bition, avarice, love--"the world, the flesh, or the  ; devil," in some form, is always the idol. Perhaps, love; the first, the most disinterested, self-devoted, of all the forms of idolatry, comes nearest to the true  worship. But it is not the true worship-by all the  t anguish that it brings, it is not the true worship. Oh I if but for a moment we could raise our souls to God, in the self-surrender wherewith, in passionate ; devotion, we throw our hearts beneath the feet of some weak and perishable form of clay-that were  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7865-00000071"/> 158 'INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. conversion-that were regeneration--that were a great deliverance-that were eternal life, and full of joy!  And are there not moments when we catch a glimpse of such a possibility'? when brain end heart stand still, thoughtless, breathless? when life itself pauses in the transient revelation of such unsufferable light? And we know that some have entered in and lived this light all the days of their lives. To/ many of us, alas! and in most of our moods, they seem to live in an unknown world-to speak in an unknown tongue. , Who of us has not occasionally experienced these thoughts and emotions, in reading and meditating on the lives and characters of Christians of any name?l--it matters little what; for there is a unity of spirit in all regenerated children of God, of every nation, rank, or sect. Fenelon and George Whitefield- the French- man and the Briton--the mitred archbishop and the poor field preacher-the Roman Catholic and the Methodist, dwelt in the same lilght, spokl;e the same language, because both were one in spirit. What if through the medium of each separate brain, the the- ology look different? The heart is greater than the brain; or, in other words, the affections are higher than the intellect. "Out of the heart are the issues of life ;" and "this is life eternal, that'we shouldl know the true God, and Jesus Christ whorn he liath sclnt." With their hearts, their affections, they discerned IIim. And in love they were one with each othler, and one with Christ and God. And who, in conm- muning with their fervenlt souls--in meditating on their perfect faith and love-perfect devotion to God.

Akin to this was the feeling that impelled the dying  Wolsey to exclaim, "Had I but served God as dili-  gently as I have served the king, ]E would not have . : given me over in my grey hairs."          I And as Markl Sutherland stood gazing in bitter-  ness of spirit upon the beautiful scene of his love  and joy, the maddening scene of his trial and suf- fering, these words escaped from his bursting heart:  "Oh, God I if I had worshipped thee as I worshipped  her, Thy beautiful work, I had not been now alone-- , alone in my sorrow."  It was the sincere, earnest cry of a stricken, penitent,  suffering heart.        . It was answered then and there. Around him fell-.- an influence sober and more genial than sunshine- more refreshing than dew-a spiritual influence, warm-  ing, renewing, supporting-a Divine influence, kind-  ling and strengthening the soul within him. The Comforter had come, and was acknowledged.  With uncovered head, and uplifted heart, then and$ there Mark Sutherland consecrated his life to the ser-  vice of God, and His work on earth. .  From the beautiful vale he turned, and, inspired . by new strength and courage, put spurs to his horse, I i and galloped rapidly on towards the road leading to   &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7865-00000072"/> 160  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. the town of C   , where, six weeks since, he had parted with Lauderdale. He reached C   in time for an early breakfast. Here-not wishing to leave his family in ignorance of his fate, and by his depar- ture thus to cut down the bridge of communication between them and himself-he addressed a letter to his bachelor uncle, Paul Sutherland, informing him that his destination was some north-western town, whence, as soon as he should become settled, he should write. He gave this letter in charge of the landlord, to be forwarded as -soon as his uncle should return from the North. He then mounted his horse, and took the road to Natchez, whence he intended to em. bark in a steamboat up the Mississippi. He reached the city by nightfall, and found his baggage, sent by the stage-coach, had arrive[ in safety. He took the boat that passed that night; and the next morning he found himself many miles on his way up the river. "The world was all before him, where to choose His place of rest, and Providence his guide." And to a young, adventurous, hopeful spirit, this uncertainty, joined to liberty, was not without its pe. culiar charm. During the greater part of the day he regained on deck, with a spy-glass in his hand, ex- am ning the face of the country on either side of the river. The lawns and villages on the Lower Missis- sippi did not attract him in the least degree. Their situations were low-their beach sluggishy washed by the thick and murky water-their thoroughfare wet and muddy-their general aspect unwholesome to the last degree. But, farther up the river, and above the mouth of the   - AREW          16i OL o, the country and the colour of the water began to, change. High bluffs, gray old rocks, and gigantic I woods, diversified the shores--crystal creeks and ver- dant islets varied the river. He approached the fine "Rock River country." Beautiful as a poetic vision of Elysium, had seemed the luxurious valley of the Pearl. But this gigantic scene-Rock -River, Rock Island, with the opposite shores of the; Mississippi, widening here into a lake-like expanse-had a breadth of gran- . deur, a Titanic vigour and vitality of beauty, the most consonant, the most imposing and encouraging,   : to his own young energetic spirit. The boat stopped opposite the village of S--, just  : as bhe morning mist was rolling away before the sun, and revealing the scene in all its picturesque beauty, and fresh life. The young city was but two years old  . -yet, infant of the Titaness West, it was growing and thriving most vigorously. Here, then, Mark Sutherland determined to take up his abode-here to  live and labour. He ordered his baggage into the    A1 boat, and stepped in after it, and was swiftly rowed to the shore. Here, too, in order to begin aright and . betimes, he shouldered his own trunk, while a porter followed with his box of books, and wended his way , to the hotel on the hilL               - 10                         . t e  x" *      ; tl  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7865-00000073"/> 162  INDIA.

(It will be burnt up one day-that's a comfort.)"-Money. EIGHTEEN months have passed since Mark Suther- land left his home. Eighteen months of persevering study, of unsuccessful effort, and of varied wanderings, find him, at the close, in Cincinnati, quite penniless, and nearly hopeless. His efforts to find employment here are unavailing. He has not even the means to pay his board-a situation-in which many a worthy and promising young man has found himself, who has afterwards nevertheless risen to fame or fortune. Embarrassing and discouraging enough is the position while occupied, however piquant to look back upon. In a listless and disappointed mood, Mark Sutherland entered the reading-room of the hotel, and, taking up the daily papers, began to look over their columns, to see if any new want of a clerk or an agent had been advertised, which might hold out the hope of employ- ment to him. At last, in the Intelligencer, his eye lighted upon an advertisement for a classipal and mathematical teacher. The candidate was required to produce the highest testimonials of character and competency, and requested to apply through the office of that paper. Mr. Sutherland's classical and mathe- matical attainments were far above mediocrity, and   THE FATAL MARRIAGE.      168 the references he could give were unexcertionable. He felt. therefore certain of being able to offer more than an equivalent for the salary. He saw, too, that the office of a teacher, by leaving him many hours of the day, and the whole of Saturdays and holidays free, would afford him ample leisure for the pursuit of his legal studies. He called for writing materials, and immediately wrote and mailed a letter of application. He was scarcely anxious about the result-only a little inter- ested to know whether he should get the situation, and what sort of a one it would be, when it was got; whether it would be the place of assistant in a public academy, or that of tutor in a private family; also, whether his temporary home shofd be in the cold North or the sunny South, the populous East or the sparsely-settled West, or in the indefinite country between them; lastly, with what sort of people he should find himself. But, upon the whole, he scarcely hoped to get a response to his application, as the paper containing  the advertisement was several days old when he first saw it. Therefore, when days passed into weeks, and weeks became a month, he gave up al1 hopes of ob- taining an answer, without much disappointment. At length-as generally happens after expectation sickens and dies, and is buried-the unlooked-for letter arrived. It contained a proposition from Colo. nel Ashey, of Virginia, to engage Mr. Sutherland as private tutor, to prepare his two younger sons for the university, offering, in remuneration, a very liberal salary, and requesting, in the event of Mr. Sutherland's O* - , - ;  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7865-00000074"/> 164  INDIA.

Mark sat down and wrote at once, closing the con- tract, and, promising to be at Ashey by the first of March.  It was now near the last of February. He sold his horse, paid his bill at the hotel, and having money enough remaining to take him to Virginia, left the same afternoon by the steamboat up the river, and met the stage at Wheeling. After two or three days' travelling upon the turnpike road, through the most sublime and beautiful mountain and valley scenery in the world, he arrived, late one evening, at the little hamlet of Ashey, situated in a wild and picturesque gap of the Blue Ridge. Here, at the little inn, he ordered supper, and pur- posed to spend the night. But he had scarcely en- tered the little bed-room allotted to him, with the in- tention of refreshing himself with ablutions and a change of dress, before the head of the host was put through the door, and the information given that Colonel Ashey's carriage had come to meet Mr. Sutherland, and was waiting below. xHe finished his toilet, however, before leaving his room. He found the parlour occupied by two boys, of about thirteen and fifteen years of age, disputing the possession of a pistol, which, in the wrestle that en- sued, went off-harmlessly. And before Mark could reprove them for their imprudence, they came to meet him. The elder lad, cap in hand, inquired, respect- fully- "Are you Mr. Sutherland, sir " "Yes, my son; have you business with me?"   JLLJMJU MrL j jxLc.&amp;IAAN 'jli . 1 0. "Father has sent the carriage for you, sir-that is all. My name is Henry-he's Richard. St. Gerald, you know, is in Washington. He is in Congress, you know, and has made a great speech-father says, one of the greatest speeches that has been made since" Oh, sho He's a great deal older than we are, Mr. Sutherland; and he's only our half-brother be- sides. You don't know every thing," said the younger boy Richard, addressing the last phrase, accompanied by a punch in the side, to his brother. "I am happy to meet you, Henry-how do you do, Richard?" said Mr. Sutherland, giving a hand to each of the boys. "And so," he added, smiling to himself, and at them, "this new star of the Capitol--this eloquent and admired St. Gerald Ashey-is a relative of yours?" "Our brother," said Henry. "Our half-brother," amended Richard, favouring his senior with another malicious punch in the ribs. Hereupon another scuffle ensued, which Mr. Suther- land ended, by saying- "Come-shall we go on to Ashey Hall, or will you take supper first, here, with me?" ' "Take supper first here, with you," assented the boys, who could have been tempted by nothing but the novelty to forego their father's sumptuous supper- table for this poor tavern meal. "It was kind to come and meet me. But how did you guess that I should arrive this evening?" "Oh, we did ,not guess. Father thought it about time you should come, and he sent the carriage, and  intended to send it every stage-day until you did come,  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7865-00000075"/> 1O   J LN DiA.

While they supped, their horses were fed and watered. And, half an hour afterwards, Mr. Suther- land and his pupils entered the carriage, and were driven to Ashey Hall. It was quite dark when the carriage drew up before the door of a large, rumbling' old building of red sandstone, scarcely to be distin- guished from the irregular masses of rock rising be- hind and around it. A 'bright light illumined the hall, where the travellers were received by a negro man in waiting, who would have conducted them into a drawing-room on the left, but that Henry and Richard, breaking violently forward, threw open the door upop the right, exclaiming- "Father is here. He is come, father We found him at the village." A genial wood fire blazed and crackled in the wide, old-fashioned chimney of this room; and near it, in an easy chair, beside a candlestand, sat an old gentle- man, engaged in readifng a newspaper. No whit dis- turbed by the boisterous onslaught of the boys, he calmly laid aside his paper and stood up--an under- sized, attenuated old man, with a thin, flushed face, and a head of hair as white and soft as cotton wool. He stood, slightly trembling with partial paralysis, but received Mr. Sutherland with the fine courtesy of an old-school gentleman. The boys hurried about their own business. The man-servant placed an arm chair for Mr. ,;i   J LaJaLJ.-a J. sJJ .i Ims ..tlw..,:.KJCl  . .-U Sutherland. And when the latter was fairly seated, the old gentleman resumed his own seat, and inquired whether his guest had supped. Being answered in 1 the affirmative, he nevertheless ordered refreshments to be served there. A stand, with wine, sandwiches, cake, and fruit was placed between them; and while they discussed these, the old gentleman, in an indifferent sort of manner, said- "By the way, Mr. Sutherland, have you seen Mon- day's paper, with the debate on the tariff? Here it  is; take it-look over it. Never mind me, I would prefer that you should see it now. If any thing strikes  you, just read it aloud, will you?" Mark took the paper, but found the "debate" to be all on one side, and in the mouth of one individual,  to wit-the Hon. St. Gerald Ashey, of Virginia. He ran his eye over it-the old man fingering cheese and crackers, and pretending to eat, not to interrupt him. "Do you wish me to read this debate aloud, sir?" asked Mark, benevolently inclined to indulge the aged father's pride. "Yes, yes," said the old man, smiling, nodding, sand crumbling soda crackers; "yes, if it will not 1 tire you." "Oh, by no means," answered Mark; and forthwith began. The celebrated speech was, indeed, a master-piece of legislative oratory; and Mark Sutherland was an admirable elocutionist. He read, became deeply in  terested and absorbed, and before long was betrayed, by the old man's enthusiasm and his sympathy, into declamation, interrupted now and then by Colonel  I q  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7865-00000076"/> 168g  INIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL Ri1VEI. Ashey's exclaiming, "That's it I hear, hear. Tauwtt must have brought down the House! I wonder what the Democrats will find to say to that/" Finally, laughing at the fever into which he had worked himself and his hearer, Mark finished the speech, and laid down the paper. It was time-it was past eleven o'clock-late hours for country people, and far too late for the aged and infirm. "Thank you, sir. Thank you. You have- given me a treat. It was as good as if I had heard it spoken," said the old man, flushing with pride and pleasure. Soon after, he rang for night lamps, and a servant to show Mr. Sutherland to his room. Early next morning, Mark Sutherland arose and left his bed-room. The family were not yet stirring; none but the house servants were about. And with the restlessness of a heart ill at ease, he walked out upon the piazza, to find diversion from the bitter re- trospections of the past, and gloomy forebodings of the future, in the novel aspect of the country around him. To one used to the undulating, luxurious beauty of southerni scenery, there was something startling and inspiring in the abrupt, stern, rugged, yet vigour- ous and productive aspect of this mountainous region. -The Ashey plantation filled the whole of a small valley, shut in between two curving spurs of the Alleghanies, and watered by a branch of the Rappa. hannock. The Ashey house, an' irregular but massive building of red sandstone, wassituated at the foot of the mountain; behind it arose hoary rocks, inter- mingled or crowned by dark evergreens of pine and cedar; before it, at some distance, flowed the branch*   THE FATAL MARRIAGE.      169 around on every side within the vale were gardens, shrubberies, orchards, wheat and corn fields; and here and there, picturesquely placed, or half concealed by trees or jutting rocks, were the negr6 quarters; while more conspicuously, in the midst of the open fields, stood the barns and granaries. Altogether, the planta- tion, occupying the whole valley, and completely shut in by mountains, was an independent, isolated, little domain in itself. Now, upon the- second day of March, the grass along the margin of the branch was already fresh and verdant, and the wheat fields sprouting greenly. The morning was very bright and fresh, and Mark walked into the garden that lay to the left of the house. There he found three or four negroes, under the di. rection of the gardener, engaged in clearing up, beds, tying vines, trimming trees, and repairing arbours and garden seats. This place had not the luxurious beauty of the south, nor the fresh and vigorous life of the west;yet there was a solid, jolly, old homeliness about it, very comfortable even in contrast to those other scenes. Mark felt this, while alternately talking with the old gardener or contemplating. the old home. He was interrupted by an irruption of that Goth and Vandal, Henry and Richard Ashey, who, rush- ing upon him, seized the one his right hand and the other his left, and boisterously informed 'him that breakfast was repdy, and had " been waiting ever so  long."'  He returned their vehement greeting good-humour- edly, and accompanied them into the house, and to the breakfast-table, which was set in the old oak  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7865-00000077"/> 170  INDy&amp;.

Two ladies, in simple, graceful, morning dresses of white cambric, sat near the fire, occupied with a little delicate needlework; Colonel Ashey stood with his back to the chimney, with the paper in his hand, and talking to them about the speech. On seeing Mr. Sutherland, the old gentleman im. mediately stepped forward, welcomed himn, and con- ducted him to the ladies, saying, "My dears, this is Mr. Sutherland; Mr. Sutherland, my" But before another syllable was spoken, the elder lady had lifted her face, started up with a blush of pleasure, and extended her hand, exclaiming- "Mark Sutherland  I s it possible!" "Mrs. Vivian! Miss Vivian!" exclaimed Mark, extending a hand to each, impulsively. "Why, how strange that we should meet herel" said Valeria. "A most pleasant surprise, indeed " responded Mark. "The surprise as well as the pleasure is mutual, I assure you I But how did it happen?" "I am sure I do not know." "Nor I. Can you guess, Rose?" and Mrs, Vivian turned to her step-daughter, who remained silent, with her fingers in the unconscious clasp of Mark Suther- land's hand.  "I inquired only in jest, but now I really do believe you could tell us something about this," persisted the lady, looking intently at the maiden. Rosalie's pale face slightly flushed; she withdrew her hand, resumed her seat, and took ufp her work. f   YTHE FATAL MARRIAGE      171 Colonel Ashey, if he felt, certainly expressed no sur- prise at this re-union; but as, with stately courtesy he handed his niece to the head of the table, said, "As Mrs. Vivian arrived only yesterday afternoon, and retired at once to rest from the fatigue of her journey, and as Mr. Sutherland reached here last night, there has been no time for conversation, about our arrangements." "Ah, yes; that's all very well; but' you'll never make me believe that Rose is not at the bottom of this, somehow," laughed the widow, shaking her jetty curls as she sat down at the table. Her eyes met those of Rosalie for an instant, and the spirit of mis- chief was quelled. She became silent on that topic, and soon after changed the subject, entering into gay conversation about St. Gerald Ashey and his sudden fame. When breakfast was over, Colonel Ashey invited Mr. Sutherland to accompany him to his study, where he began to unfold his plan for the education of his boys. After hearing him through, Mark inquired when he should enter upon his new duties, and re- quested to defer the commencement until Monday, and to use the intervening time to become acquainted with his home and pupils. The interview then closed. Both gentlemen de- scended the stairs. Colonel Ashey told Mr. Suther- land that he would findthe ladies in the parlour, and then, excusing himself, bade him good morning, and entered the carriage, which was wadting to take him to the village.

Mrs. Vivian sat upon the sofa, her head bent, her jetty curls drooping, her jetty eye-lashes and rosy cheeks sprinkling and sparkling with tear. drops, like morning dew upon a fresh flower. She was nimbly and nervously stitching away at a piece of muslin embroidery. Rosalie sat on a cushion before her, with her hands and her needlework fallen idly on her lap, and her pale hair fallen back from her paler, upturned brow, and earnest eyes, that were fixed upon her mother's. She was asking in open accents, "Oh, mamma I can this be possible?" "Not only possible, but true, Rose," replied the lady, dashing the sparkling tears away. "Oh, mammal do not let him meet such a shock; prepare him for it, mamma." "I cannot; how could I? Hush-here he is," said she, perceiving Mark. And in an instant, presto I all was changed. Smiling out from her tears, like an April sun from a cloud, or a blooming rose scattering its dew in the breeze, she looked up and said, "Come in, Mark; draw that easy chair up here to the sofa, and sit down, for I know by experience that men are lazy as the laziest women." Mr. Sutherland took the indicated "seat. Miss Vivian started from her lowly position, resuming her place upon the sofa, drawing the foot-cushion under her feet, and arranging her needlework. "It is really surprising that we should all meet here so unexpectedly in Alleghany county," said Mrn Vivian.   lJ.?J aJ'.&amp;J LAj DOAKlAUrJi. 1t6 "I certainly had not anticipated such a pleasure.

Rosalie arose, rolled up her work, and left the room, nodding and smiling to a young man who en. tered as she left. "Mr. Bloomfield," said the lady, presenting him to Mr. Sutherland. Mr. Bloomfield was a sufficiently pleasing specimen of a well-bred, country beau-moderately tall, broad-shouldered, and deep-chested-with regular features-fresh, ruddy corm plexion-clear, merry, blue eyes-and lips, whose every curve expressed the good humour and benevo- lence of a kind, contented heart.  "You mustn't take Rose far, Robert." "I will take her only to mother's." "And you sha'n't teaze her with any more non- sense! I can't put up with that, you know." Robert Bloomfield blushed violently, smiled till all his regular white teeth shone, and was stammering out a blundering deprecation, when, to his great re- lief, Rosalie appeared, attired for the ride. The young man arose, Mrs. Vivian surveyed Rose, to be sure she was well defended from the cold, and finally yielded her in charge of her escort, who bowed And took her out. Mrs. Vivian and Mark looked at them through the window, saw him place her in the saddle with more than polite attention-with a careful and tender soli. citude that made her smile. When they had ridden off, she turned to Mark, and said- "I like that good humoured, blundering boy. He has been paying court to Rose ever since she has been here.

"And why not?" asked the lady, with a little jealous petulance. "Why may not a widow re- marry?" "Nay-I do not know, I'm sure," said Mr. Suther- land, with his eyebrows still raised, and his eyes fixed upon the floor. "My mother married! Will you please tell me to whom?" "To whom?

And after. a short pause he sai, "There was another-my cousin." The face of the lady grew troubled-she did not speak. "Is India well?" again spake Mark, in a faltering voice. "India is well, and beautiful as ever. She was the belle of Washington last winter-her beauty the theme of every tongue-the envy of every woman, the madness of every man.

She divided public interest and attention only with St. Gerald Ashey, that great new planet on the political  horizon."  Mark Sutherland's whole strong frame was con-  vulsed. He started up and paced the floor in ex- treme agitation-then, seizing his hat, rushed out of the room. "And I was to prepare him for it, said Rosalie l" exclaimed Mrs. Vivian, looking after him, as the pity  of her heart grew strong.                  [ CHAPTER X.  ROSALIE   AND  HER  LOVER.

"Yes, I was putting an imaginary case," she said, in a low, quiet tone. She drew rein. "What is the matter, Rosalie? Are you tired?

"Rest awhile, and then we will go on." "No-I must go home-the air is very chill," she said, shivering.  "And you are pale," he observed, gazing at her with earnest, affectionate interest. She returned that gaze with a pensive, grateful glance, saying- Indeed, I feel I ought to be very grateful to you for caring so much for a poor, sickly creature, like me.

"You had better-we have strawherries' for the first time this spring." "Nonsensel" exclaimed Robert, with an offended air. "Strawherries from uncle's premium conservatory, and cream from my own premium dairy; you had better think it over 1" ,  - "Nonsense 1" exclaimed Robert, contemptuously. "Oh, then, there's no more to be said, of course!" "Good morning, Rosalie!" "Good morning, Robert; but won't you shake hands with me?" she asked, offering her hand. He seized that little hand) and squeezed it and pressed it to his lips, and with an expression of curiously-blended de- precation and reproach, dropped it, mounted his horse, and galloped away. Mrs. Vivian was standing dawdling with a white rose in the piazza. She came forward, with tender care, to meet Rosalie. "Did you ride far--are yov tired, love?" "Not very." "But you look pale and wearied." "A moment's rest will restore me, dear mamnma." 'Come in and sit down, while I take off youi things," said the kind little lady, leading her step- child into the parlour. She sat her down. in a deep. gushioned chair, rang the bell, ordered a cordial, and then removed her hat and riding skirt. When she had made Rosalie take a cracker and a little glass of   ROSATOMR.        185 anise-seed cordial, and when the salver was removed, and they were left alone, Rosalie reclining upon the sofa, Valeria sitting in the easy chair near her, the lady inquired- "Why did not Robert come in?" "I do not know, unless it was because he did not wish to do so." "Have you quarrelled?" "Quarrelled I Dear mamma, I never had a quarrel/ with any one in all my life, and never expect to havn one with anybody-least of all with Bob."    J "That is no reason you should not have a lover's quarrel--they befall the most amiable pair. Is it so?" "What, mamma?" "Have you and Robert had a 'lover's quarrel?'" "No, indeed-I assure you." "Yet Robert went away offended-' in dudgeon,' as uncle would say." Rosalie looked distressed. The lady eyed her search- ingly. "Rosalie, will you let me speak to you frankly, and ask you a few questions?" "Certainly, dear mamma; I would turn my heart inside out, and show you its most hidden secret, if it had any secrets."           :  "Well, then, are you and Robert engaged?" "No, mamma." "He has not yet proposed, then?" "I\ scarcely know, mamma, whether I ought to re- veal poor Robert's confidences." "Well?"  "Well, mamma!"

"Do you ever mean to review your decision, and accept him, Rosalie?"         i "Never, mamma, I assure you!" "Are you very certain, Rosalie?" "Certain, dear mamma, beyond all possibility of doubt." "If I could believe it" "Dear mamma, you may rest assured of it! Why, if I thought it was to be my fate to marry Robert Bloomfield, well as I like him, I think I should die of grief!" "And yet you keep his company I Oh I Rosalie, I am surprised." "Is it not right, mamma?" "What a simple question! Oh, child I if it were not you, I should say it is unprincipled 1"   ; "Mamma; you distress and alarm mel Why must I not keep pooF Robert's company, when he takes so much comfort in my society?" "Comrnfort! Does he take comfort-do you call it comfort? No, Rosalie, it is a feverish, consuming hope that keeps him at your side; a wasting, baleful hope, which, since you do not intend to realize to him, it is your bounden duty to extinguish for- ever!" "Mammal I do not quite understand you. H am sorry, very sorry, that I cannot return Robert's re- gard" "Ohl" exclaimed the lady, interrupting her, "I am not sorry for that: as to that, I am very glad you are not engaged to him, nor ever likely to be; but" "But why add to the grief of rejection the bitter- ness of ingratitudeand coldness?"

The flame without fuel will soon expire harmlessly." By this time the young girl had quite recovered from her fatigue, and she arose and left the room, to prepare her strawherries, she said. She passed into a pleasant back room, connected with the pantry and dining-room, but opening upon the garden, and devoted to certain light dessert pre- parations; such as the shelling of peas, stoning of cherries, &amp;c. -It was a cool apartment, with a bare, white oak floor, and many doors and windows open, and- looking out upon the pleasant garden, with its budding spring flowers-its roses, hyacinths, and daffodils-and upon the orchard, with its peach trees and cherry trees, covered with pink and with white blossoms, and further off, upon the green and dewy wheat field, lying in fertile dales between gray and mossy rocks and mountains. It was indeed a. pleasant apartment, looking out upon a fresh, verdant, rural scene. Rosalie sat down in the midst of the room, with a basket'of fresh strawherries on her right hand, an empty basket to receive the caps on her left, and a cut-glass dish on her lap. She chose to do this. She had a decided attraction to these little graceful domestic avocations; and as her nimble fingers capped the strawherries, and dropped berries in the dish, and threw caps in the basket, she began to sing some lively rural glee; and while she was busily engaged, singing and capping, she chanced to look up, and saw Mark Suthirland approaching the house from the garden. He met her glance, and smiledl She   ROSATTPE. -i was in a merry mood, or she would not have felt free- to say to him what she did. "Come in, Mr. Sutherland; I have got something for you, very nice 1" Mark came in, and she said, "Make a bowl of your joined hands, now, and here!" Slie poured into his hands somefie large straw- berries, adding, "These are the first fruits of the season, Mr. Suth- erland, and we offer them to you."  ( "Let me first merit them, by helping ou," said Mark. "Will you help me?" "Certainly; that is, if I am not intruding on some s housekeeping sanctuary." "Oh, no! this room is open and common to the whole family; why, it is the pleasantest room in the house, only as it is near the pantry and dinmig-room, and opens upon the kitchen garden, we prepare our fruit, and sometimes pick over opr vegetables here." Mr. Sutherland drew a chair on the other side of the strawherry basket, and went to work-nobody' could tell why--actuated by some whim, no doubt. After a little desultory conversation, Mr. Sutherland said, "I believe, dear Rosalie, that I owe this situation to your friendly remembrance, and I have been wait- inDsome hours for an opportunity of expressing my thanks." Rosalie's face flushed to the temples. "I am deeply obliged and grateful to my fair patroness."'          -. The blush deepened, crimsoning her face.

"Miss Vivian, are you so unwilling to receive my acknowledgments? Then must my gratitude be silent, but not the less deep." Again she essayed to speak, and the words came vehemently, impetuously. "I had no agency in procuring this situation for you, Mr. Sutherland. How could you think for a mo- ment that ;, or any one else, could presume to 'pa- tronize' you in such a manner? How could you sup- pose, for an instant, that I, or any one else that knew you, could deem this position a fit and proper one for you? No I could I have dared to interfere, it would have been to prevent your coming here." There was a tone of honest, earnest indignation in her voice, looks, and manner, that utterly astounded Mark Sutherland. Could it be that she thought him unworthy of the position? No; he dismissed that surmise at once, and answered, quietly, "I confess you, surprise me, Rosalie I Is not the vocation of a teacher really honourable, if conven- tionally humble?" "It is greater, higher, more difficult, more respon- sible, than any other, except that of the preacher of the Gospel!" answered the girl, earnestly. "What is the matter, then'-am I unfit for it?" "Yes, you are totally unfit for it." "Why?" smiled Mark; "has my education been neglected?" "I know that you are a distinguished classical and mathematical scholar, Mr. Sutherland; and for any other branch of knowledge quite, fitted to take a pro-   ,.WmJL...a..     'JssLV fessor's chair; but to be a teacher of youth requires other and rarer qualifications, which you have not." "To wit?" inquired SMark, much amused with his young mentor. '"First, then, you should have a natural vocation for teaching, and consequently the love of it, which you have not; a great deal of affection for children, which you have not; much patience, perseverance, firmness, social humility, some of which qualities you have, and others you have not." t"I am tempted to ask you to specify which I have and which I have not, but I will not." "I thought you were going to open a glorious career for yourself, and achieve a great name." "In what manner?" "I thought you were going to be a statesman." "A lawyer, child." "Why are you here, then, Mr. Sutherland??Why are you not a lawyer?" "Rosalie, I made an effort, many an effort, to get admitted, to practice, at the bar of S--. I had  thought myself well qualified, for I had studied legal science with what you call an attraction-a vocation for the profession. For several years past I had read law con amore; yet, through the want of, familiarity with the technicalities of practice, I failed to get ad- mitted as a practitioner before the court."' "Then I would have gone into some lawyer's office, and assisted him as a copyist for nothing, until I had acquired an intimacy with those crabbed technicalities. It seems to me such a very trivial matter for an im- pediment. Why, there is your uncle, who is no law yer, but who can draw up a right legal and binding A^/         *.

"My dear Rosalle, that would have been a very small beginning." "'Despise not the -day of small things,' said the wise man. And at least the lawyer's office would have been in the way of your genius; and to have entered it in the capacity of copyist would have been much better than to have turned into this by-path, which is utterly apart from it." "There were difficulties in the way of even that, Rosalie." "'And even if there were difficulties, what then? We have no royal road to distinction in our country. We have no ready-made great men. None are 'born great;' none have 'greatness thrust upon them.' If any would be great,. he must 'achieve greatness.' Nearly all of our heroes and statesmen have struggled up from the humblest places in society-have strug- gled up, alone and unaided, until theyhave' proved their mettle; and the struggle has been wholesome for them, and has turned them out sound and health- Tful natures." "You speak wisely and truly, dear Rosalie; yet each of all these men to whom you have alluded, had near and dear friends-mother, sisters, a wife, per- haps-to watch his career, and rejoice in it--to soothe him in moments of exasperation, from injustice, from opposition, from persecution, and to encourage him in hours of depression and despondency, when all his hopes and energies seemed palsied, and the wheels of life and action seemed clogged and stopped; and, finally, to share and enjoy his success, and to glory in   his triumph.

"i Well, if it is so as you say-for I do not know and cannot judge of young people, having never had any young companions-I suppose it is because I have beelf always sickly, and have always led an isolated, meditative life; hearing in my secluded retreat only the loudest thunders of the distant great world of society, I have naturally thought most about its great successes, and how they were accomplished. . I have thatched from 'afar the career of living great men, and hlave secretly made unto myself idols like them. I have read witlh deep interest the lives of distinguished statesmen an I heroes, particularly those who have struggled up from poverty and obscurity; that is the reason." "Yet that is very unusual in so young and beautiful a girl. I cannot yet comprehend it-I can scarcely believe in it." "The pleasures of childhood and girlhood were not for me-there was nothing left but books, and much thought over needlework, in solitary hours. Please do not give me undue credit; it is more mortifying than blame. I must tell you how it was I thought so much of your life. Nearly two years ago, after you made such a vast sacrifice to principle-giving up wealth, station, popularity, family, friends, love, es- teem, all for your ideas of duty-hero-worshipper that I was, I recognized in you the elements of which heroes are made, and"   ROSATIr        195 She blushed, and suddenly stopped, conscious of the indelicacy of praising him to his face. "Go on, dear Rosalie." Still she remained silent and embarrassed. "Well, Rosalie, you saw, or rather you thought you saw, in me the elements of heroism?" "It was very impertinent in me to presume to say so-forgive it 1" "Nay, dear child, I beg you won't take it back If you do not hope for me, who will?" "Indeed, I do hope for your success very strongly -and more than that, I count upon it very confi- dently" "But finish what you were going to say; yoiu saw in some one 'the elements of which heroes are made, and'     t "Oh, nothing, only I dived more deeply than ever before into my lives of great men, and reflected more than ever upon the causes that made them great, if you do not think it presumption in a girl like me to talk of reflection upon such a subject. But my mind ever had an attraction to it, and you gave that attrac- tion a new and strong interest. I thought of you, and hoped that you were on the road to an honour- able and beneficent distinction. I was grieved to hear that you were coming here; I -would have- opposed it, had I dared. Do not stay here, Mr- Sutherland." "I must fulfil my engagement with your uncle!" "My uncle will release you from it." "Yet, dear Rosalie, I cannot leave now." "Do not think me importunate, impertinent; i wish you would go even now to-day."  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7865-00000090"/>  Mark Sutherland looked up at her in surprise, but checked the answer that rose to his lips, when he saw her troubled face. Her work being now completed, she arose, and left the room. CHAPTER XII. BRIDAL   PREPARATIONS. Oh, yet we know that somehow good Will be the final goal of ill, T pangs of nature, sins of will, Defects of doubt, and taints of blood: "That nothing walks with aimless feet; That not one life shall be destroyed, Or cast as rubbish to the void, When God hath made the pile complete: sf That not a worm is cloven in vain!

FOR the next several days, various notes of prepas ration as for some joyful coming event, were sounded through the old hall. Servants, within and without the house, pursued their avocations with unusual alac r rity. Waggons,with new furniture, arrived from      a neighbouring town.   In the drawing-room    and par- lours, Mrs. Viviah directed the operations of the up- holsterers, in putting down new carpets, and hanging new curtains, mirrors, &amp;c.  On the lawn, and in the garden, Rosalie's taste presided at the trimming and   BRIDAL PREPARATIONS.     197 dressing'of vines, shrubs, and flowers; while from one to the other Colonel Ashey flew with a gay, busy in- terest. They were all evidently playing the prelude to some great family festival. Mark Sutherland re- mained unenlightened upon the subject, until, onev morning, as lie walked out upon the piazza, to enjoy the early freshness of the air, he was joined by the two lds, Henry and Richard, who, seizing each a hand, eagerly inquired- "Are you going to walk out this morning, before breakfast, Mr. Sutherland?" A nod and smile was his answer. He was de- pressed, despondent; he felt that he had no part in all that was going on in that house-he felt himself a stranger and an alien. Yet, too generous and bene- volent to damp the spirits of the lads by his own gloom, he smiled upon them kindly, and when they asked permission to accompany him, he inquired, gaily, how it happened that, while all were so very busy, in the house and on the grounds, they alone should be idle. "Oh, Mrs. Vivian drives us out of the way-even Rose won't let us help her, and father threatens to lock us up if we don't keep quiet.

At last- "Making such a fuss 1" again complained Richard; "making such a fuss, and driving us about soethat we boys can't have a bit of peace of our lives I Just as if she were so much better than everybody else in the world, that so much trouble must be taken for her." "Whom are you talking of?" inquired Mr. Suther- land, carelessly. "-Why the young lady St. Gerald is going to marry, to be sure 1" "Ah, then, Mr. Ashey is going to bring home a wife, is he?" "Why, of course he is!" said Henry, warming up. 'He is going to be married to a beautiful young lady, very rich, who was the belle of the city last winter, they say 1" "Oh, she is as rich and as beautiful as a princess ij a fairy book; and that's what all the fuss is about," sneered Richard. "Don't you mind Rich, Mr. Sutherland; he can't bear to have a word said about anybody but him- self!" "As if I wanted anybody to bother themselves about me--I'm not so much like you as that," retorted Richard. And thereupon arose the usual squabble be- tween the lads, until their tutor interfered and restored order, if not good feeling.

Colonel Ashey, Mrs NVivian, and Rose, were al. ready seated at the breakfast-table, and engaged in eager conversation concerning the approaching mar- riage of the heir of the house, when Mr. Sutherland and, the lads entered. "Good morning, Mr. Sutherland. 3hope you have had a pleasant walk-though I would not be bothered with those troublesome boys, if I were you; their com- pany is quite enough in school hours, I should think " said the old gentleman, banteringly, as they-took their places at the board. Mrs. Vivian and Rosalie smiled a salutation. And then the thread of the conversation was taken up again, as if it had never been broken, and as if ' Mark Sutherland was already familiar with the pre- mises.                  - "Yes; St. Gerald writes me that the marriage will come off at an early hour of the day,xand that imme- diately after the ceremony they will set out from Washington for this place. It will take them two days to reach here, so that we may expect the party on Thursday evening. Rosalie, my dear, bear that in mind, if you please, and be ready. Mrs. Vivian, my dear lady, I do not want two cups'0f chocolate at once-this, I think, is intended for Mr. Suther- land " said the old gentleman, passing the cup to Mark.

Colonel Ashey went to his study, to write letters; Mrs. Vivian and Rosalie to their work-table, in thei parlour; and Mark to his school-room, with the boys. The ladies had scarcely seated themselves, before a servant entered to say that Mr. Robert Bloomfield had come with the ponies, and wished to- know if Miss Rosalie would ride. "Don't go, Rose; send an excuse. Cut this cornm panionship firmly and kindly off, at once and forever," said Mrs. Vivian, in a low voice. "Tell liim, William, that I am very much obliged for his kindness, but I cannot ride to-day," said Rosali?, and, as the servant left the roon, she added, 4 That' was a very unkind, ungrateful message, mamnma"               A "Nonsesense  What kindness or gratitude do, you owe to Robert?" answered the *dy, with an a parent harshoess of sentiment that her heart did not by any , m n$s justify.  \ But, before Rosalie could reply again, Robert Bloomfield entered the room, flushed and in haate; and, without even seeing Mrs. Vivian, hurried up to the young girl, exclaiming--" Rose   how is this?

You are, I feel you are--I know you are; I see it in your face, Rosalie," he persisted, gazing on her troubled counte- nance, and reading, but not aright, its sorrowful ex- pression. "Indeed, I am not displeased with you, dear Bob. How could I possibly be, when you never in your life gave me cause for any other feeling towards you than esteem and thankfulness?" "'Esteem and thankfulnessl' I told you before, Rosalie, if you persisted in talking that way you'd drive me out of my senses!" Here Mrs. Vivian hemmed, to give notice of her presence; and Robert Bloomfield turned, and per- ceived her for the first time. If he had not observed the lady before, he did not care about her now. - He bowed; and then, forgetting her, turned, and resumed his conversation with Rosalie, in the same impatient, impassioned tone. Mrs. Vivian, with a' cold, offended air, arose and left the room. But as soon as the door closed behind the lady, and Robert found himself alone with Rosalie, ihe certainly betrayed a ggeat sense of relief, for his manner became more earnest and vehement, and he pleaded anew the hopeless suit so often and so de- cidedly rejected. His tongue was loosened, and words flowed, without let or hindrance, in that impetuous torrent of eloquence inspired only by passion; and Rosalie listened with emotion scarcely less than his oY, for every word he uttered gave expression to the ,iaue, deep, unspoken yearning of her own heart. !  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7865-00000093"/> 202  INDIA.

At last she said-- "I have deeply wronged you, Robert. I did not mean it, Heaven knows; but I have wronged you. Robert, I am very sorry. I shall never forgive my- self."  "I don't understand you, Rosalie-I--do tell me what you mean 1" "I mean that I have not been frank enough with you, Robert. I have not had the courage," said Rosa. lie, in a faltering voice, for she still deeply pitied him. He did not look like an object of pity, just theti; all his countenance suddenly brightened with joy. He, seized her hand, exclaiming,-"Do I comprehend? Do I hear you right? Do you mean, after all, that you like me a little better than you said you did?" "No.   Oh I Robert, what a sanguine nature yours must be, to interpret every word which is not positive, in your own way  No, Robert I I mean, that I have thoughtlessly accepted all your kind services, knowing full well that I never, never can repay the smallest of them.

I have wrqnged you, by not telling you this with suffi- . cent firmness before!" "Cruel I cold I hard I heartless!" "It is my   misfortune that I cannot accept you, Robert.

"In mercy, Rosalie, why do you talk to me so, if you never mean to accept me?" -"Why, indeed? Because I cannot reject this kind ness, for which I am indeed most sincerely grateful, in any other but the humblest manner, and with every circumstance to assure you, that I feel how much good. I reject in rejecting you, Robert. Dear Robert, there is certainly destiny, as well as duty, in these matters; -and, well as I like you, I could not love you enough to marry you, if my salvation depended on it; indeed I could not. I am not destined to so easy a life, Robert. I begin to have a foreshadowing that my lot will be a very rough one, Robert; that- I shall not be left to bask in the sunshine, but shall have to face and weather the storm."

My flower garden has taught me that lesson."      / "I should like to know how a flower garden could teach you a lesson like that /" "Ohl should you? I can tell you, theyr. Last year, when I came here, I found a new flower growing in the garden. I don't know botany, and I don't know what the flower was, or how it came there; but I suppose the wind brought the seed. My flower was so feeble and withered, that it had lost all beauty and comeliness, and every charm, except a delightful, odour. -I weeded and worked around it, and watered it regularly, and nursed and cherished it, but it faded faster and faster, yielding a dying fragrance. I said it was too exposed and cold, and I took it up and transplanted it to the conservatory. There it wilted and fell, and I gave it up for lost. But now mark the sequel. A few days after, I took a ride up to the mountain top, and left my horse, for a ramble on foot. A fresh, delicate, delicious odour greeted me. I looked about, and lo I therein a cleft of. the rock on the mountain top, where it would be exposed to all the snow, and wind, and hail of winter, and burning rays of summer, was my strange hot-house plant I There it grew and flourished, swaying to and fro in the wind, and filling all the air with the freshness of its fra- grancel Now what do you think 'I did, Robert?

THE day at length came upon which St. Gerald Ashey and his young bride, with their attendants, were expected to arrive at Ashey Hall. Early in the afternoon, the carriage had been sent to the village to meet them; and in the evening all the members of the family were assembled in the drawing-room, to await them. Many of the country gentry, who had been invited to meet the bridal party had joined the circle in the course of the evening, the rooms were now quite full. Among the guests present were  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7865-00000095"/> ZVu  i NIA. 'rti JLr ALZ, U.1' r"JA KL 1 RIVE lK. the Right Honourable W   R   , then Governor of the State; Judge M  ,of the Supreme Court; and a few others, high in state or national authority, whose distinguished names are now historical.' But there was no one present so proud or happy as old Colonel Ashey, who walked about gently rubbing his hands, in the simple gleefulness of his- country heart and habits. The carriage was behind time; for the reason, it was rumoured, that the bride and her attendants chose to rest an hour or, two at the village. At length, however, the welcome wheels were heard to roll up to the door, and the travellers to alight and enter the hall. They retired to change their dresses before entering the drawinrg-room. In the meantime, among the country neighbours in the saloon, all was half-sub- dued excitement and expectancy. Among the com- pany was Mark Sutherland, of course. He was not one to shade with his dark brow the brightness of other people's gaiety. In the social temper of youth, he had sought to enter into the spirit of the time, and had laughed and jested with the young people, or "talked politics" with the elders, as the case de- manded. He had heard the slight, subdued bustle in the hall, incident upon the arrival of the bridal party; and the instant absorption of the whole heart of the assembled company, in the interest of the moment, [ had left him free. He had stood a few moments quite alone and unobserved, when a sligh tremulousness of the air near him, a slight disturbance of his own serenity, caused him to look up. Rosalie Viian was standing near him, with a de- precating, imploringlook an asture. Her face was prctfg   ml 'n.-loka   white as the white crape dress she wore,'and. hei wreath of snow drops quivered with the trembling of her frame. Startled by her appearance, he asked hurriedly- "Dear Rosalie, has anything happened? What is the matter?" "I ought to have told you beforeI Some of us ought to have told you! I ought to have done so 1" she answered, somewhat vaguely and wildly. "Told me what, dear Rosalie? 'What is it?" "Give me the support of your arm into the next room-there is no one there." "My child, you are not well!" said Mark, looking at her now with painful anxiety, as he drew her hand through his arm. "I am not good, you ought to say. I have not been good  I have been a cowardl I have not been your friend, Mark I I have been a traitor."  "A traitor I Rosalie, you rave 1" "I ought to have told you any time this month past; but I could not bear to doit. And now it is scarcely any use at all; it is a mockery to tell you. But yet, indeed, I could not bear to see you standing there, so gay and unsuspicious. I could not bear to think how you would lose your self-command in her presence. No, I could not endurethe thou'ght, Mark"I she said, more and more incoherently. "Rosalie, you are very nervous; you have over- excited yourself about.- his wedding. Come, let me get you something," said Mark, drawing her gently through the crowd. As they passed, the buzz of conversation increased very much, and "'Tl/ are corg; "The bride is ,EL* .-*- ,      -  4'   ' /d  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7865-00000096"/> 28   INDIA.

He took her to a sofa, seated her, handed her a glass of water; but she waved it aside, saying, "I do not need it-I do not need it I It is you who need strength and calmness now. O, Mark L I wish you had left the house when I advised you to leave itl" she exclaimed, her agitation becoming momentarily greater. At last, forcing herself to speak again, she asked: "Mr. Sutherland I Mark I Do you know the name of the lady whom St. Gerald Ashey has maied?" "Cerainrly," said Mark Sutherland, raising his eye- brows in an interrogative manner. "You do!" exclaimed Rosalie, greatly surprised- excited. "Certainly I do I How could I possibly remain in ignorance of it?" "You do i You know iti And yet you are so calm I Nay, indeed, I am afraid you. are mistaken; whom do - you suppose it to be?" "One once betrothed to myself-my cousin India 1" "You know it I And you are not unhappy about it f Oh, blessed Lord I am so thankful--so glad!" And Rosalie dropped her face upon her hands, and wept softly and quietly. ";Dear Rosalie, has all this disturbance of yours been caused by your sympathy with unworthy me?" "I remembered how you suffered at Cashmere-I feared-I dreaded if you met her suddenly here-the bride of another-that"---- "Well,. dear Rose. -That"-'-   THE MEETING.       209 "Oh, I fear you think me very impertinent. If you do, you may tell me so; indeed, t shall not take it amiss." "Tell me your thought, Rosalie. Was it that all those old wounds woulld be re-opened? That all those sufferings would be renewed?" "Yes!" "Yet you see that they are not." "No, thank Heaven, Mark! But I cannot under- stand it." "Well, then, understand it now,. The advent of my promised bride, as the wedded wife of another, does not disturb a pulse of mine, because, in my heart-in any honourable heart-love could not long survive esteem, more than it could survive hope or duty, and because"--  Here his whole manner grew most earnest, most intense, and passing his arm- over her shoulder, he drew her face towards his own, and kissing away the tear drops from her eyes, said, "Be- cause I love this single tear of true feeling better than the whole heart of yonder selfish beauty!" And now, if Mark fancied tears, he might have a plenty of them; for now they fell warm and fast. "What is the matter, Rosalie? Why do you weep now?" asked Mark. But she did not answer. He repeated the question perseveringly. At last, Bobbing softly, and smiling, and sighing, and blushing, and averting her face, she said, archly, "Juliet wept at what she was 'glad of.'" "Are you glad, Rosalie? Tell me, dear Rose. Are you glad that I love you more than all the world- -e 13            7     i  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7865-00000097"/> g 210 INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RiVEB. that I have Chosen you the guiding star of my life?" .  She did not, could not answer. He repeated this question, also searchingly, perse- veringly, only to hear her answer; and he bent his ear, and averted hs eyes, and quelled the beating of his heart, to win her reply. At last it came, with her face hidden on his shoulder, and in a tone scarcely above her breath-"I always hoped you would like me at last; I did not think you would so soon, though." "But tare you glad-are you glad?" persisted the unreasonable man. "Yes, glad," whispered Rosalie; and in proof of her truth the tears rolled quietly down her face. "And so am II Glad, happy, hopeful, confident, Rosalie! There will be no more faltering, and faint. ing, and failing now I You have infused new life into me.

They were interrupted, of course;. people always are when they are very blessed. It does not suit "the rest of mankind", to leave them so. This time it was old Colonel Ashey, who really was happy eno'.gh in himself to have left Mark and Rosalie alone -n their content, if he had known it. He came in with a brisk step, with his slight figure seeming slighter, his grey hair lighter, and lis thin, rosy face fiercer than ever, with the effervescence of his joy. He advanced, speaking--   THE MEETINGr.       =" "Ah, Mr. Sutherland, you are herel I have been looking for you. What I will you bethe last, to pay your respects to the bride, and she a relative-though a very distant one, I suppose, of your own? Come, let me present you." "Does India-does Mrs. Ashey expect me?" in- quired Mr. Sutherland. "I imagine not 1" replied the old gentleman, raising his eyebrows; " but that does not matter, you know. Come i" Pressing the hand of Rosalie, before relinquishing it, Mark Sutherland arose to accompany Colonel Ash- ley to the front drawing-room, and to the presence of the bride. They could not at once approach her, on account of the number of persons around her; yet the room was not so thronged with company as to prevent their having a full view of the bride and her attendaits. There stood India receiving the homage of her circle-her superb form arrayed in the rich and gor-  geous costume that was so well adapted to her ma- jestic and luxurious style' of beauty. Her cheeks' were mantled with a rich, high colour, yet this seemed not the carnation bloom of youth and health, but the fire of a feverish excitement. Her eyes were dark and brilliant, yet not with the light of innocent love and joy, but with the blaze of a burning and con- suming heart. "Come," whispered the old gentleman; " it is no use to stand here waiting our opportunity; for we might stand all night, and those fools wouldn't give way. ,  Poor wretches l--just like boys peeping at a gentle- man's conservatory, where they know they dare not /.* -'c  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7865-00000098"/> 212  INDIA.

Come, we must elbow through that circle of dandies; gently, you know-gently." -a    And suiting the action to the words, Colonel Ash- ley adroitly insinuated himself through the outer - crowd and through the nearer circle, and into the very presence of the bride. She was not looking towards the new-comers. She was listening to a gentleman, who, having apparently exhausted all other subjects of adulation, was now ex- patiating upon the rare and exquisite beauty of the bouquet she held in her hand. Colonel Ashey and Mr. Sutherland were before t * her. "Mrs. Ashey" She looked round. "Will you permit me to present to you my young friend, Mr. Sutherland-a distant relative of your own, may I hope?" )   Mark Sutherland looked up, caught her eye, and bowed deeply. But before he had had time to do so, before even the deliberate ceremonious presentation speech of the old gentleman was half over-at the very instant she had turned around, and her eye had fallen upon Mark Sutherland-a change, an appalling change, had come over her lovely face and form, like that which might be supposed to sweep over the face of some beautiful and fertile oasis at the sudden blast of the simoom, that buries all its luxurious beauty in the burning and arid sands of the desert. As by the sudden smite of death, all colour was dashed out from  her cheek, and all light from her eye. For a moment she stood and gazed, transfixed, unable to withdraw her stony eyes from his; then ..-na         e s  fr m h s  t e   THE- MEETING.       213 with a sudden cry, as if some tightly-strained Beart- string had snapped-the tension of her form relaxed, and she fell to the floor I In an instant all was confusion. Raised in the arms of her father, Clement Sutherland-who, until that moment, had- remained obscure in the back- ground--the swooning bride was borne into the ad- joining room, and laid upon the sofa, while resto- ratives were anxiously sought for, to be administered. In the meantime, in the saloon she had left, only two persons-Mark Sutherland and Mrs. Vivian--un- derstood the cause of her fainting. Various innocent conjectures prevailed, far from the truth. "It was the heat of the .room," thought one; "Over-excite- ment," opined another; "Standing so long," fancied a third; "The fatigue of her journey," imagined a fourth. "Really, it was too inconsiderate in Colonel Ashey to oblige his daughter to receive company upon the very evening of her arrival," complained Mrs. Chief Justice M--, a large, heavy person, fan- ning herself slowly. "I noticed her face was very pale," said a sympathetic lady, drawing upon her im- agination for her facts. "Indeedl but I thought it was very flushed," interrupted a matter-of-fact indi- vidual.  All these various conjectures were expressed in low, almost inaudible tones; while, undisturbed and smiling, Mrs. Vivian passed among the company, and, as it were, moved upon the troubled waters of their half-suppressed excitement, and, with her mere smile of self-possession, restoring calmness and order. Presently the door of the inner room opened, and the bride reappeared, leaning lightly upon the arm of  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7865-00000099"/> I:   2i4  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RlVf:iK. Oer father, and attended by her husband and brides- maids. She entered, and passed up the saloon to her former position. Several country gentlemen zealously drew forward a cushioned chair, and several sympa- thetic old-fashioned ladies approached, with inquiries and expressions of condolence. Pale and weary, but smiling and self-possessed, Mrs. Ashey gracefully accepted the services of the former, and replied to the interested questions and comments of the latter. "It was very ill-judged on the part of the Colonel, my dear, to subject you to the fatigue of a reception, just off your journey-very indeed," said Mrs. Chief Justice M     r "I do really think we ought to exercise the good taste of retiring," whispered another. Whether India heard this remark or not, she an- swered- "I am not fatigued. We made but a very short stage to day, and rested several hours at-the next vil- lage. No; it was the warmth and closeness of the room. The windows are open now, and the effect has gone with the cause," she added, smiling brightly, while at the same moment the consciousness of the first falsehood she had ever uttered in her life brought a warm though transient blush to her cheek, that re- sembled the returning glow of strength, and reassured all doubt. After a little, the musicians began to touch their instruments, and soon struck up a lively quadrille air. The-younger portion of the company gave signs of restlessness. Gentlemen hesitated, and then chose their partners for the set, and remained awaiting the mo-   tions of Mrs. Ashey. As hostess, it was her right to select any gentleman present to honour with her hand for the quadrille; and as-bride, it was her privilege to lead off the danco. When India became aware that all were waiting for her, she threw her eyes over the assembly; and the aspiring heart of many a youth beat faster when their beams lingered for an instant on him. But he for whom she looked was nowhere to be seen. At last, a smile of scorn and self-scorn writhed swiftly athwart her lips; and her eyes s lddenly blazed as their light kindled upon the form of one who came in at the farthest door. Quick as lightning flashed and fled the spasm of that face, leaving it serene and smiling, as she arose and met the new-comer, and said sweetly- "My cousin Mark, will you honour me?" And before the astonished man could bow, she had placed her hand in his, and he found himself by her side, at the head of a set that instantly formed around them. India spoke and smiled with her usual charming ease, and danced with her usual grace and dignity. And after the dance was finished, and her partner had led her to her seat, she detained him near her, toying with her fan or bouquet, talking of a thousand nothings. She presented him to her husband; and- Mark Sutherland, of course, politely expressed him- ,  self pleased to form the personal acquaintance of one -with whose public life and services he had been so long familiar, &amp;c. Throughout the long evening, India maintained a regnant self-control. And Mark Sutherland wondered at the seeming inconsistency of her conduct. He did A v .. -  ?:7  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7865-00000100"/>  not know, or he did not reflect, that in the first in- L:   stance of 'surprise, her nerves had - so to speak-got x-i  the start of her will, and so betrayed her; but that after once the will had regained the ascendancy over the nerves, it was able to control them. Not again that evening did Mark Sutherland find an opportunity to speak w'ith Rosalie. India detained him at her side, smiling, chatting, and in .er daring audacity carrying back their recollections into scenes and times and places that suggested the parallel of taking lighted candles among open casks of camphine or gunpowder. Her indifference was too well attested to be genuine. But (Mark Sutherland's perfect calm- If-  ness-real and thorough, as hers was assumed and, superficial-assisted her. The drama of the evening was at last over. The company had departed, the lights were out, and India found herself, for a few moments, alone in her chamber. She had smiled, and glanced, and chatted, and charmed .all eyes and ears to the last. She had gained the privacy of her chamber-she had angrily, then fiercely, rejected the services of her attendant, -'  and turned her from the rooum. And now, for the I:   moment, she was alone and free-the acting all was a-   over-the mask might be laid aside--the miserable !   victim of pride might seem the wretch she really was. And oh! the fearful change that came over"that beautiful but agonized face when the mask of smiles fell! She threw herself, all robed, and gemmed and wreathed, as she was, prostrate upon the bed-her form  convulsed, her bosom heaving with the suffo- eating anguish, which, from its very excess could not be vented.   "False I false 1 false 1" she wailed  "False to Mark! false to my husband I falser than all, to myself I Lost I lost I lost I Lost, body, soul, and spirit! -Would that I could die!" A light, gay footstep on the stairs, a low, love-tuned voice near the door, and it opened, and St. Gerald Ashey entered, with a smile of confiding affection on his noble face.

She had not witnessed India's fainting. She knew of it, but ascribed it, as others did, to fatigue, heat, and over-excitement. She never once associated the swoon of the bride with the meeting with her former lover. It is true she had dreaded this meeting, for the sake of Mark, who, she feared, still'*cherished anA affection for India; but she had no such fears for her. She could not have imagined-the simple integrity of her heart shielded her from imagining-that India could have given her hand to one man, while cherish- ing a thenceforth guilty preference for another. Of course, she had heard and read of ladies who deser:it crated marriage by making a legal sale of themselves  C s  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7865-00000101"/> *   210  INDIA..

No; the thought of India, while the wife of another, still loving Mark, and fainting at his sudden appearance, never entered the girl's mind. She heard and entirely believed India's own explanation of her swoon-" the closeness of the room"- and so, undisturbed by the suspicion of that suffering near her, which, had she known it, would 1^ have greatly troubled her peace, Rosalie yielded up her soul to serene joy. That night in her prayers she returned earnest thanks for the happiness accorded her. She sought her pillow in the filness of content. Mark loved her I beyond this, she did not care to ask or hope any earthly good. Mark loved her I this was happiness enough for one long season. Mark loved her I the thought enveloped her soul in a benign sense of perfect protection, safety, and comfort. Mark loved her I the thought was perfect peace. Wrapped in it, she sweetly fell asleep.  She awoke in the morning, with a vague impression of a great happiness sleeping in her heart. Suddenly, with a shock of electric joy, she remembered what it was-Mark loved her I Again, in her morning wor- ship, she offered up fervent thanksgiving for this priceless boon of love; and after she had made her isimple morning toilet, she left her room, and went down stairs. Her self-assumed domestic duties claimed attention; but still the light of her inward joy bright- ened all her countenance.  Coloel Ashey, always an early riser, was in the   BOS IE-         21Y hall when she descended. . He met her, smiling. She was smiling, too. "Well, my bonny girl!" he said, "spite of late hours, our mountain breezes are beginning to make the roses bloom on your cheeks. You look very pretty this morning!" "Well," said Rosalie, " how long am I to keep the keys, or when am I to deliver them up to Madame lepoutse?" "Ah I I don't know. How should I? You must settle that between you. In a few days, I suppose. Ask your pretty little mamma; she is likely to know such points of domestic etiquette. Madam does not look very much like the material of which Virginia housewives are composed, I must say. I fear, little girl, that you will still have to carry the keys." "Now, you know, uncle, if I am to have all the duties of housekeeper, without the dignities of mis- tress, I intend to demand a salary for my services. Do you hear?" "And you shall have it, my dear--ten kisses a day. Will that suit you?" Rosalie laughed and left him. It was yet early in the morning, and she went to "see after" breakfast. Her first visit was to her diary, to have the new milk strained, and'the old rilk skimmed, and the cream and butter iced and brought out for breakfast. Then she sent two little negro girls into the garden, to gather raspberries-a necessary luxury in its season on a country breakfast table. Then she went into the cellar, to select the fresh fish and game and oysters that had been kept in ice. Then went to the pantry, to give out coffee, teaj cho-  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7865-00000102"/> 220  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. colate, sugar, &amp;c. Then to the plate and china closet, to "parade" the best Sevres breakfast service and the family plate, in honour of the occasion. Her next visit was to the breakfast room, to see that the table was well arranged. "I wonder, after all, if India will like to spend two hours of the early morning in this manner, instead of lounging them away over her own elegant toilet," said Rosalie to herself, as she passed into the room. Findings all in order here, the busy little housewife. passed next into that pleasant room near the kitchen and the pantry, and fronting upon the garden, and devoted to the picking of vegetables and fruit, and such little half-horticultural, half-culi- nary pursuits. Here she found her two little black handmaids, with their baskets of raspberries, waiting for her. She praised their diligence and took the raspberries, and was engaged in putting them in cut- glass dishes, and powdering them with sugar, when she felt a light hand laid upon her shoulder, and, glancing around, she saw Mark Sutherland standing behind her, smiling upon her. A sudden bright blush suffused her beautiful countenance; but she exclaimed, saucily-          "Not even the grace of Paul Pry, to say, ' I hope I don't intrude.'" "You know you gave me the freedom of this room long ago, little housekeeper." "A privilege which men like you seem inclined to abuse," answered Rosalie, glancing at her gingham gown, holland apron, and turned-up sleeves. "Beautiful in that also, Rosalie. What a charming little peasant you makel" "I think so too," said Rose, ingenuously; and then, ,4   ROSALIE.        221 blushing and laughing, she suddenly corrected herself, saying, "Oh/ I did not mean that; I meant I like this dress and this occupation, and think they suit me perhaps as well as,-any other." "Shall I help you with this also, Rosalie?" said Mark, taking up a sugar-duster. "Oh, no, thank you I I have nearly done. If you want employment, you may go into the garden and select a bouquet of the sweetest half-blown white rose buds and heliotrope that you can find, as a morning offering to our bride." "And for you, a posy of heartsease," he answered meaningly, pressing her fingers as he went. Rosalie finished her fruit, ornamenting the edges of the dishes. with fresh green leaves, and sent them to the table. Then she went and changed her dress for breakfast; and when Mark returned from the garden, he found her standing in the hall waiting for him. She was looking very lovely, in her fresh white muslin morning dress, without any ornament, but her own soft brown ringlets, and the bright blush and smile lighted by happiness. "Here they are, sweetheart!" he said, gaily and fondly showing the flowers. "An elegant bouquet for the bride 1" she exclaimed admiringly. o u And a sweet little posy for you," he said, placing the heartsease on her bosom. "I est a propos, n'est ce pas?" "It is fit."

"I mean only to show you, as long as you speak it to me, that there is not a word or phrase in that fash- ionable and hackneyed language, that has not a shorthr, stronger, and more expressive synonym in our own mother tongue.

CHAPTER   XV. DISCORDANCE S. "But here upon this earth below, There's not a spot where thou and I Together for an hour could breathe."--Byron. It was impossible that the discordant elements of social life assembled at Ashey Hall could harmonize for an instant. Of the family party gathered around the breakfast table, the pale, beautiful India assumed a mask of smiles-Mr. Ashey wore a look of anxious perplexity he did not care to hide-ark Sutherland appeared self-possessed, but was too conscious to feel really at ease. Colonel Ashey was secretly annoyed, to find the re-union around the breakfast table not quite so cheerful as might have been expected Mrs. Vivian was vexed at the general tacit antagonism, and resolved, if this should last, to bring her visit to a close as soon as possible. Nevertheless, she kept up a, irregular fire of wit and repartee, to prevent the party falling into dead silence. Rosalie alone was truly at ease. She was totally ignorant of any cause of disunion in the circle, and too much absorbed in her own infinite content, to notice signs of disturbance among those around her. When breakfast was over, the little lady drew Rosalie off into the piazza, and away up to-the honey- suckle-shaded end, where no one was likely to come but the honey bees. "Ana now, Rose." she asked, " what is it? Your  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7865-00000104"/> I:    224  IN'DIA.

"One should be merry in wedding times!" "Merry in wedding timesl Look here, Roqalie! Some marriages are made in heaven, some on earth, and some--in the other place. But it was not merri- ment, but profound, still joy, that lighted your eyes, Rose! Now, what was it all about?" "Mark loves me, mammal" whispered the girl, hiding her face upon her step-mother's shoulder. "Now, that's the^ most absurd thing I ever heard in all my life!" exclaimed the little lady, shoving her off, and walking rapidly away with a highly-flushed cheek. Rosalie knew her too well, and trusted her too thoroughly, to feel any anxiety. She walked behind her, put her arms around her waist, and, bending for- ward, looked up smilingly into her eyes. "You needn't think to get the better of me that way, Rosel It is ridiculous, I say I What do you mean to do with this love?" Rose folded both hands over her bosom with a look of unspeakable content. Both look and gesture were. involuntary. "Aye, hoard it away, treasure it deep in your heart, I suppose you mean. Silly girl Well, what is to be the end of it all?

"Will he not?" "No, I will never believe it!" "He will fill up the measure of his animosity-be- lieve that I Clement Sutherland did not appear at the breakfast table this morning.

He hates him for his political opinions, for his principles, and, more than all, for having had the power to give up the beautiful India.

And now, with the opposition of your guardian, who is invested with such power over your fortune,- what.,have you to expect in giving yourself to Mark Sutherland?" "I do not know; I shall leave it all to Mark. It is no conditional promise I have given him-no half- faith I have pledged him. I have given him the full and complete control of my destiny.

And now, amidst opposition, persecution, desertion, he must know that there is one who will follow where. ever he leads-one heart that will cleave to him, in joy and in sorrow, in life and in death." At that very instant the boy brought the mail-bag, intruded upon them, and handed Mrs. Vivian a letter. As soon as, her glance fell upon the superscription, her face flushed to the forehead, and, for the moment forgetful of Rosalie, she hastened to read it. While this confidential conversation was going on between the young step-mother and her daughter, another scene, portentous with fate, transpired in the study of Colonel Ashey. As that gentleman was leaving the breakfast-room, a message was brought him from Mr. Clement Sutherland, desiring the favour )f a few moments' private conversation with him. Colonel Ashey returned word that he would be pleased to see Mr. Sutherland in his study. Thither he imme- diately proceeded, and thither soon followed his guest. Clement Sutherland entered, with a forbidding and foreboding scowl upon his brow. Colonel Ashey instantly arose, set a. chair, and in- vited him to be seated. Clement Sutherland, without unbending the stern- ness of his features, bowed, and sat dpwn. "I trust you are in good health this morning, Mr. Sutherland," said the Colonel, urbanely. "I am well, sir," replied his guest, coldly. "I was sorry to miss you at the breakfast table this morning. I trust my little girl made you comfortable in your own apartment?"  DISCORDANCES.       227 "Thank you, sir." Colonel Ashey was silenced and repelled for a little while by this churlishness on the part of his inter- locutor; but, speedily recollecting that it was his guest who had sought this interview, he inquired with some - , reserve of manner- "Can I be so happy as to serve you in any way this morning, Mr Sutherland?" "Who recommended that young man whom you have engaged as a tutor?" asked Clement Sutherland, curtly. Now, Colonel Ashey might well have been pro- voked by the abruptness of this question to make some unpleasant answer, but Colonel Ashey was a gentleman and a host. He replied with the utmost courtesy, yet in a manner that administered the keenest and most delicate rebuke. Looking at his guest, he said, slowly and with meaning, "His name recom- mended him, Mr. Sutherland." "That is just what I feared. That is the one thing, unhappily, of which we cannot deprive him, and makes us, in some degree, responsible for him. Pray, sir, did you know anything of this young man's past history?" "Nothing."        , "You fancied him a relative of ours?" - "Certainly."  "Now, then, will you be so kind as to give me your attention for a few minutes?" Colonel Ashey settled himself in an attitude of fixed interest, and Clement Sutherland commenced a narra- tion of some considerable length, which, at its close, left Mark Sutherland with the character of a graceless  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7865-00000106"/> H!    228  INDIA.

"Sir, an incendiary does not parade his combustible matter before your eyes, and look like he was going to fire your house!" "He does not seem to me to be at all dangerous." "Sir, dangerous people never seem dangerous." "I rather liked the young gentleman, I confess," said Colonel Ashey, slowly and hesitatingly. "Sir, would you like your children to imbibe revo- lutionary principles? Would you like your servants incited to revolt? Would you like an estrangement and separation brought about between your son and daughter-in-law? Would you like your niece to elope with a fanatic?" "Mr. Sutherland, I must say that you shock me beyond  endurance. You ruthlessly grasp subjects that a man of honour and delicacy scarcely likes to touch. You have dealt severely with the young nan, also, in your speech. He may be an enthusiast--en- thusiasm is a fault appertaining to youth and genius -and, moreover, persecution is not at all to my taste; it is always the growth of cowardice.

I do not fear that my children will be per- verted, my negroes maddened, my niece infatuated, or my son and his wife divorced, by the presence of this high-souled but mistaken young gentleman in my family. I told you that I liked Mr. Mark Sutherland, and I cannot hate him to order. Nevertheless, as it is not expedient that one formerly betrothed of Mrs. S Ashey should be here to annoy her by his presence, I will see the young gentleman, and arrange the speedy termination of our engagement." Mr. Clement Sutherland expressed himself satisfied, arose and left the room. Colonel Ashey remained with his head upon his chest, in an attitude of serious thought, for a few minutes; then, pulling the bell-rope, he summoned a servant.             , "Go," he said to the man that entered, "and request Mr. Mark Sutherland to favour me with his company here for a few moments." The messenger went out, and in search of the tutor. Meanwhile, Mark Sutherland was in his own room,  engaged in reading a letter that had arrived by the morning's mail. - It was from his old college friend; Lauderdale.  It was -a very long letter, being the first that he had written to Mark Sutherland for more than two years.  He began by reproaching-- Mark for dropping the correspondence, and leaving him in igno- rance of his whereabouts. He next informed his friend that he owed hism knowledge of his present residence to a happy accident-namely, to information given him by a fair lady with whom he had been so fortpnate as to maintain an epistolary correspondence; that he go'tlr rr as  A      -  I  r1  V*,  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7865-00000107"/> aid.  230   INDIA.

Had she kept up a constant correspondence with Lauderdale? And had she even invited him to the house? He could not endure the suspicion for a moment. No, not even if it were only a cool, friendly correspondence. He could not endure that Rose should be on friendly terms with any man except himself. He read on. The letter proceeded to tell him all that had befallen the writer since he had last written; how he had settled in a Western country town; how, after some difficulty, he had been admitted to the bar, and how he had already got into a toler- ably lucrative practice. Finally came the most start- ling news of all-viz., that two months previous, he- L. Lauderdale, Esq.-had come into the possession of an estate of sixty thousand dollars, by the demise of his godfather, a widower without children or near relatives, and who, dying, bequeathed to him the whole of his considerable property. "I do not fully realize this event, dear Mark," he wrote; "I cannot realize my personal interest in it. All I do feel-but that is much, that is everything-is that now I may go to Ashey Hall, and lay myself and my fortune at the feet of my fair friend, the beautiful widow, Mrs. Vivian." Mark took a long, deep breath. "What do you want, sir?" he said, looking up, and for the first time seeing Colonel Ashey' s servant standing in the room. The man delivered his message, and Mark promised    to attend Colonel Ashey soon, and dismissed the mes- senger. He resumed his letter. There was little more to be read, but that little was full of fate. "It matters not to- me, now, dear Mark, what quarter of the country I live in. That shall be de- cided by the will of my fair queen, Valeria. One thing- is certain--this 'law shop' and this village must be given up. My evacuation of the premises will leave a fair opening for any enterprising young gen- tleman who may choose to fill it. What say you? If you are still 'seriously inclined' to the ingenious profession of the law, let me know. If you are dis- posed to step into my shoes, you will find them not much worn, with not even the gloss off, only the creak and harshness taken out of them a little. Think this over, so as to be able to give an answer, by the time I see you. You may expect me soon." Full of thought, Mark Sutherland folded up his letter, and went to the study of Colonel Ashey. The old gentleman received him with a degree of kindness almost paternal. He arose and took his hand, and requested him to be seated. Then, after some delicate hesitation, he said- "I was not, until this morning, made aware of the very interesting relations which you qonce sustained towards a young lady--your cousin-now the wife of my son. You were once engaged to be married to Miss Sutherland, I hear?" !"Yes, sir," replied the young man, seating himself, in a calm, unembarrassed manner; while the old gen- tleman scrutinized the expression of his countenance, without finding anything there-to displease him.  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7865-00000108"/> 282  DIA.

She took sides with her friends, and-we parted; that is all." 7 "You mean, my honoured young friend, that when called to do so, you made a stupendous, an unpre. cedented sacrifice of fortune, family affection, and love, for the sake of principle-mistaken principle, perhaps, yet still principle. Was it not so?" Mark Sutherland bowed. "My dear young friend, we differ in opinion; but I highly respect you. I earnestly pray that you may be set right," said the old gentleman, warmly, as he held out his hand to, Mark, who grasped it, pressed it, and let it fall.   "Mr. Sutherland, in every exigency of your life, I pray you to consider me as your friend, ready always to serve you with counsel or assistance of any kind. I have fancied that since the unexpected rencounter of last -evening, you might have something to propose; or, rather, that you might wish to propose, yet be with- held by some exquisite sense of honour and delicacy. I entreat you now to waive all considerations save those of truth, and speakl freely to me." "I had something to say to you, Colonel Ashey, 3 and, under the circumstances, the approach of the subject was, as you rightly inferred, extremely diffi- cult to me.

Colonel Ashey sprang from his chair, shoving it behind him, and stood gazing with astonishment upon the young man-with simple astonishment, unmixed with regret or resentment. At last- "How long has this gone on, sir, without my knowledge?" "I fancied it was not without your knowledge, sir. , Our association has been very open. I fancied, from your .own words, that you expected the communica- tion I have just made," said Mark, with a surprise   almost equal to his own.

"So so-ll have addressed- Miss.. Vivian?" -  Mark bowed. "And won her consent to be yours?" Another bow of assent. "Humph I well--so I have been truly warned, after all!

You may know that he has no way of supporting you, and your guardian would see you both in the bottomless pit before he'd advance a cent of your fortune.

"Yes, you may go 1" answered the old gentleman, rising, and holding the door open for her to pass. And Rosalie left the study. In the lower hall she saw Mark Sutherland. He came to meet her, drew her arm within his own, and, then they both walked into the garden. "Well, dear Rosalie, do you know that I shall probably leave here in the course of a week?"

It is true, that when Rosalie made known her pur- pose to Mrs. Vivian, the lady opposed the contemplated marriage with entreaties and tears; but finding that entreaties and tears only distressed the maiden with- out shaking her resolution, the young step-mother felt neither the right nor the inclination to attempt the arbitrary control of Miss Vivian's destiny.

Yet it is not fair or wise to contemplate the worst possibility only. The Western pioneers are not always laid up with the ague and without tea 1" said Rosalie, with a sparkle of fun in her eyes.     But in a moment after, the young girl's face grew serious, and she said, in a tremulous voice, "And besides, dear mamma, the very bughears that you have evoked to frighten me from my journey only draw me on to go.

WITH   Miss Vivian's uncle the difficulty was even less in obtaining  his consent to the marriage with- Mark Sutherland; and   for the following, reasons:-  Colonel Ashey worshipped his proud, talented son, St. Gerald; and in his estimation no interests could compete for an instant with St. Gerald's interests. Colonel Ashey liked Rosalie well enough, and wished her well enough, and he was resolved to do all he could to insure her future happiness, yet if a  slight risk of her welfare would insure the domestic peace and   content of St. Gerald, Colonel Ashey was not one to hesitate between the conflicting interests of his I niece and son. And that the marriage and departure of Mark Sutherland and Rosalie would tend greatly to tranquillise the life of the already disturbed bus. band, he could not now doubt. It was dreadful to notice all the  fatal effects of  India's want of faith-it was awful to anticipate the final result. The once haughty and  self-possessed woman was growing spiritless and nervous, subject to extremes of excitement and depression, moody, irri- table, and flighty to the last degree. Her glorious beauty was withering, wilting, as you have seen some   DE'AtiRT UICES.      zad s richly&amp;blooming flower wither suddenly without appa- rent cause--wither as if scorched by the burning lreath of the sirocco. And the cause was apparent to' etery one around her, not excepting her bitterly- wtonged and most wretched husband-to every one ardund her but Rosalie, whose perfect truth and inno- cece of heart shielded her from the suspicion of so   l much evil. If it was fearful to see the ravages that , misery had made in the glorious beauty of India, it was not less so to obserye its desolating effect upon  { the splendid genius of St. Gerald.           I It was now a stirring time with aspiring young statesmen. A great national crisis was at hand; and- it behooved all prominent politicians to be up and do- ing. St. Gerald, of all statesmen, should have been the most active, the most energetic. The eyes of his party were turned in anxiety towards him--the eyes of old grey heads, exhausted by a long life's service, and reposing on their well-earned laurels, and the eyes of young aspirants, panting to succeed to them, were all fixed upon St. Gerald, as their hope, their leader, and their deliverer I A senator already, he is carried up on the tenth wave of popular favour! Should he serve them well in this crisis, as he surely can if he will, for his talent, his eloquence, his influence is -1 mighty among the nations; should he serve them well  this time, there is no honour, no, not the highest in the gift of the people, to which he may not reason- ably aspire!

St. Gerald should be up and doing, for now is the " tide" in his affairs, which " taken at the flood" may bear him on to for- tune--aye, ultimately to the Presidential chair. St. Gerald should be active, stirring-for every day is destiny! But the young statesman is doing absolutely nothing. He is withering in inaction, because is bride is withering from his side. Colonel Ashey perceives it all. And can he see the brilliant fortunes of his proud boy thus wrecked, if the sacrifice of Rosalie will help to avert the ruin? No, Rosaliel Only give yourself to Mark Suther- land, and coax him away to "parts unknown," to that "bourne whence no traveller returneth," if possi- ble, and your uncle will smooth your path-he will try to persuade Clement Sutherland to forego his wrath and hate, and yield you up your own fortune-he will give you his blessing, and as much assistance of every kind as your independent spirit will permit you to accept. Colonel Ashey, in fact, gave his full consent and approbation to the engagement of Mark Sutherland and Rosalie Vivian. He even joined Mr. Suther. land in persuading Rosalie to fix an early day for the solemnization of the marriage. And, having settled that matter to his satisfaction, he next sought his friend, Clement Sutherland, and, having informed him of the betrothal, entreated him to make some provision from the bride's fortune for the young couple, or at least to settle an annuity upon   DEPARTURES.        249 her until she should be of age, and enter upon the possession of her property. But Clement Sutherland was proof against all argu- ments and entreaties. He locked his grim jaws fast, and would yield not a cent or a kind word. At last Colonel Ashey left him in indignation and despair. He did not then know that hate and revenge were not the only reasons that constrained the guardian of Mark Sutherland's young bride to hold a death-grip upon her purse-strings. No one then suspected that the money-grasping passion of the man had tempted him into ruinous speculations and embezzlement of the orphan's funds. "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof;" therefore, let them not dream it yet I A week after this betrothal, Mr. Lauderdale arrived, to fulfil his engagement with the " sparkling" young widow. He was received with the utmost pleasure by hisDld friends and acquaintances, and welcomed with cordial hospitality by Colonel Ashey. The next week witnessed two bridals. Mr. Lauder- dale and Mrs. Vivian were married at Ashey Hall, by the pastor of the parish; and at the same time and  place, by the same minister, Mark Sutherland and. Rosalie Vivian were united in that bond that only death can sever. , The next day there were two departures: Mr. and- Mrs. Lauderdale bade an affectionate adieu to their friends, and set out for their palace home in the South; and Mark Sutherland, and Rosalie, his wife, departed for their log cabin in the West.  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7865-00000117"/> 250   &amp;NDIA.

"Does my dear Rosalie perceive any very remark-. able difference in the aspect of these opposite shores?" asked Mark, bending his serious gaze upon her.  "Yes! I notice that one shore is thickly studded  with thriving villages and flourishing fields, while the other is a comparative wilderness, with here and there a plantation house, and at long intervals a stunted  town. What can be the reason of this?" "Have you not already surmised the reason?" The thoughtful eyes of Rosalie roved slowly over  the scene, and then raised and fixed their earnest gaze upon her husband's face, and she said-,-  "It is so. There is only one set of persons in the civilized world 'who are more unhappy than the ' negroes." "And they are" -. "Their masters."

"From fitness: we are unwilling to be taught our duty by an antagonist who reasons in partial igno- rance of the facts, judges harshy and unjustly, and speaks not the truth in love so often as falsehood in hatred; and from analogy: all great successful re- formers that the world has ever known, havearisen- not from the outside, but from the very midst of the evil to be reformed. .

"Rosalie! Rosalie I why had I not known you bet- ter before? Why could I not have loved you only from the first? Why have the last two or three years of my life been lonely and wasted?"

It was situated on the right or east bank of the Upper Mississippi, and the dwellings were scattered up and down the high bluff so oddly, that a passenger, look- ing upon the hamlet, said it see mned as if a giant had gathered a handful of houses and flung them at the bluff, and that they had settled at random where they had fallen. Our young couple were the only passengers for S  , and they followed their baggage into the skiff, and were landed just as the sun arose, gilding the windows of the village, and lighting up into splendour all the glorious scene. "See, Mark  It is a happy omen," said Rosalie smiling. He pressed her hand, and turned upon her a look of unspeakable love, as he handed her to the shore. There was a porter even in that rude, remote place. He took charge of the baggage, and led the way to the hotel on the top of the bluff. It was-a large, unfinished, two-story frame house, rudely built of rough pine boards, unpainted without, and unplastered within. Our young couple followed their guide, the porter, who was also the landlord, into the large bare parlour, which was also the kitchen of the inn. This room was scantily furnished, with a few rough chairs, a table neatly enough set out for breakfast, and a glowing cooking stove, in full blast, at which stood the cook, who was also the lanq y getting breakfast.   THE JOURNEY.        265  * - The rudeness of the whole scene disturbed Mr     i for Rosalie's sake. She felt that it did. She lookedl  at him with a gladdening smile, exclaiming-- "Oh I like it, Mark. I like it so much. Every- thing is so, new and strange, and so free and easy. And so large and gras' she added, going to one of the windows, and looking out, with delighted eyes, upon the magnificent virgin country. "The air is fine here, Mark. There is a springiness and life in it I never felts before, even on the mountains. And see, the fog is all dispersed already." "Yes-it's allowed to be healthy in these parts; no ague here," said the landlady. "And so near the river-that is strange," said Mark. "Well, you see the winds blow mostly from the shore; and the fog-when there is a fog--settles on * the other side of the river. And then, many folks allow that this, being a high, lime-stone counhtry, is naterally healthy." "Have you many boarders now?" inquired Rosalie, kindly interesting herself in the fortunes of her hostess. "Only bachelors, for constant. Sometimes, when a boat-load of people arrive, we have a. house full, till they gets settled or goes somers else," replied the land- lady, setting the coffee-pot on the table, 'and ordering her lord and master to go to the door and blow the horn. She then invited her guests to sit down to breakfast, and had just begun to help them, when her other boarders, the bachelors-half-a-dozen robust, rudely-clothed, but earnest, intelligent-looking men- enter it, and gathered around the. table. The break-.  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7865-00000120"/> 56b  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEIRL RIVER. fast was plain, but substantial, well-cooked, and abun. dant. And our young pair, as well as the bachelors, did justice to the fare. After breakfast "the bachelors" left the table and the house, and went about their various businesses- some to their stores, some to their workshops. The landlady bustled about to wash up and clear away her breakfast service; and Mark Sutherland followed his young wife to the window, and said- 'And now, dear Rosalie, I must leave you here, at least till noon." "You must?" "Yes; there is much to be-done, that must be done immediately. Lauderdale's deserted law-office must be opened and aired, and my sign-or shingle, as the folks here call it-tacked up, and the place generally prepared for the transaction of any .business that may turn up. Then I have to write and send off an ad' vertisement to the nearest newspaper-which, by the way, is published in a town thirty miles distant. And lastly, dear Rose, I have to look up a cabin, or part of a frame house, where 'two mortal mice,' like you and I, may go to housekeeping. Whether all this can be accomplished in a forenoon, or not, I do not know; but, at all events, I shall try to be back again at twelve. Good bye." And, pressing her hand, he left her. Rosalie seated herself by the window, and looked out upon the new country. From the river, and from the grove that crowned the bluff .n which the village was situated, the country stretched eastward, out and out--a high, level, and limitless prairie, its flat and green monotony broken, at wide intervals, by groves ;;, ' A    'ltJtli d JUU tJ Cfi. .  -I I similar to this which surrounded S--, and relieved by countless millions of wild flowers, whose rich, gor- geous, and brilliant hues surpassed anything the ob- server had ever seen before. "What is that splendid scarlet flower that grows so tall, and is as abundant on the prairie as clover in our own fields?" inquired Rosalie. "I reckon you are talking about the prairie pink; but I haven't much time, myself, to take notice of flowers-'specially wild weeds," replied the landlady, rattling the dishes and tea-cups, and bustling about between the cooking stove, the table, and the cup- board.  "Are you not a Marylander?" asked Rosalie. "Yes," said the woman. "How did you know?" "By your speech." Just at this moment the cry of a child commenced in an adjoining room, and continued during the whole of the hostess's morning work. She set aside the table, and began t sweep the room, raising a great dust from the dried and pulverized mud left by the bachelors' shoed. Rosalie thoughtlessly threw her pocket-handkerchief over her head, to protect her hair fros the dust-thoughtlessly, for else she might hae guessed it would displease the touchy pride of the hard-working pioneer woman. "You don't like the dust-maybe yoii never saw a broom?" she asked, looking somewhat contemptuously at the young lady's delicate person. "Oh yes, I have," said Rosalie, gently, "and (- a broom, too; but I always sprinkle the floor, and : a handkerchief over my head before sweeping," "And what do you take all that trouble for?"  16   &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7865-00000121"/> 238  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. "Because I dislike the dust to settle on my hair." "Hal a hal ha! You'll get out of that, if you settle in these parts," laughed the woman-not ill-naturedly this time-resuming her broom, and continuing her sweeping to its completion. Then she fired up the cooking-stove afresh; and while it was drawing, and roaring, and heating the room to suffocation in this sultry summer weather, she wiped down the chairs with apron, and finally went into the next chamber and brought out her baby which was still squalling at the top of his voice. Giving him a piece of bread, she sat him in the cradle and went about her work, not- withstanding that the child threw away the bread, and was screaming louder than ever. Rosalie got-ap and lifted -the babe, and took him to the window, where she sat down with him, and soon soothed his temper. The over-worked mother looked pleased, but said, deprecatingly- "You needn't adone that; 'tain't a bit o' use; it'll only spile him. You'll- find 'twon't do. And if ever you have a house of your own, and a baby of your own, and no one to tend to nyther but yourself-mark my words--just exactly when the loaf of bread is burning up in the oven, and the tea-kettle is boiling over, and the fat is-catching afire in the frying-pan, that very time the baby's going to take to open its throat and squall you deaf. Let it squall You ain't got twenty pair o' hands-you can't tend to everything at once. You'll find it so, too-mark my words-I never knew it to fail!" "That is a very discouraging picture, indeed," said Rosalie; " nevertheless, I should try to foresee and prevent such a combination of perplexities."   THE JOURNEY.       259  Oh! would you? You may thank goodness if, on top of all that, your man aint down with a spell of sickness, and the cow lost in the woofs, and the well dry!" said the hostess, going to the dbor, and rapping, and calling out- "John 1 You John!" The landlord, her " man," obeyed the summons, entering from the bar-room. She met him with a sharp rebuke, for not bringing water enough, not splitting wood enough, not bringing the vegetables for dinner--"An' it drawin' on to 'leven o'clock-and he knew the bachelors would be home to dinner at twelve." And pushing the empty pail into his hand, she bade him make haste to the well, and be back in no time with the water, and so she hustled him out of the house. And soon the process of dinner-cooking  ? was commenced; and in addition to the melting heat  - of the stove, the various mingled- steams of boiling, stewing, and frying arose, and filled the summer air with thickl, greasy vapour. "Surely cooking-stoves were first invented by the demon," Rosalie could not help thinking, while she resolved, whenever she had to cook, it should be in an open fire-place, where the stifling vapours could ascend the chimnev. When dinner was ready, the sound of the horn summoned the same company, who entered first an adjoining shed, where they all washed their faces and hands, using the same tin basin and the same crash towel, and then--coarse, ruddy, healthful, and hungry -they came in, and gathered around the table. A few minutes after they had sat down, Mark Sutherland returned from his morning's ramble, and took his se at amoneg them.  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7865-00000122"/> 260  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. "How have you prospered in your enterprise to. day, Mark?" asked Rosalie, as they left the table. "I have got through all I wished to do to my per. feet satisfaction, except one thing." "And that?" "I have not been able to rent a house, or a part of a house, either for love or money And so, dear Rosalie, I shall have to leave you again this after- noon, in order to renew my search. And I am afraid you find the time hang very heavily." "Not at all, I assure you, 4ar k. I have been occupied and interested. Everything is so different here from what I have ever been accustomed to." "Yes, very different, indeed!" said Mark Suther. land, with a sigh. "Now, I didn't mean that," said Rosalie, smiling. "I meant that everything is so new and strange that I am entertained and amused every moment." "Entertain and amuse yourself, then, as well as you can, until I come back in the evening; then, my love," whispered Mark, stealthily pressing her hand to his heart, as he left her. The landlady rattled and clattered the dishes, and bustled about between table, cupboard, and cooking- stove, until she had cleared away the dinner-service. And then she proceeded to wash off the stove, raising a more offensive vapour than before. Then she ewept the floor again; then she got a tub of water and a mop, and washed it all over. And then, after wiping and putting away the tub, and pan, and mop, and doing numberless other " last jobs," she finally cleansed her own face and hands, put on a clean apron, and sat down to nurse her baby, and talk to Rosalie. But   THE JOURNEY.       -261 by this time the afternoon was so far spent, that the poor woman had not rested half an hour before it was time to get up, fire up the cooking-stove once more, and prepare supper for her family and her boarders, who would be back, she said, at six. Rosahe was sympathetically fatigued, only to wit- ness her labour's, and she could not refrain from say- ing, as she once more took charge of the fretful, teeth- ing child- "Indeed, you have a great deal to do. I do not know how you have strength to go through so much." "Ahl you will know after a bit; wait a little Lord, child, this is nothing at all! wait till wash-day,'" said the hostess, putting a great tray of flour on the table, and preparing to make bread. And once more the process of cooking w ent on, with the same accompaniments of melting heat, sti- -fling vapour, &amp;c. And again the horn sounded, and the company gathered; but this time Mark Suther- land did not appear during the whole course of the meal-no, nor after it was over. The table was cleared away, the room once more put in order, the candles lighted for the evening, and the men gathered in the kitchen, with their pipes, but still Mark did not come. The landlady was rocking her baby to sleep, and  entering at intervals into the conversaion. At last she arose, and put her Child to bed, and asked Rosalie if she should not like to be shown to her sleeping- room.                         i Rosalie replied in the affirmative; and the hostess I lighted a candle and conducted her through the mid- dle passage, and up the stairs, and openped a doosrto  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7865-00000123"/> 262  IND. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. the right of the landing, leading into a large room, unplastered, and nearly unfurnished. The room was divided in the middle by a temporary partition of hanging blankets. In the first division there were two double beds, covered with coarse patch-work quilts. The hostess passed between these, and, putting aside the blankets, led her guest to the interior divi- sion, which was smaller, and contained only one bed, covered like the others. "You are to sleep here. Is there anything you want?" she asked, setting' down the candle on a chest that served as toilet-table and washstand.' "Yes; water and towels, if you please," replied Rosalie. t I'll get them for you in a minute. When do you look for him in?" "Mr. Sutherland?--every moment!" "Umph I humph 1 Now tell me the truth-I sha'n't blame you--it's none o' my business you know, but- ain't you and that young man a runaway match?" "Why, Pro, certainly not," said Rosalie, reddening and laughing. "We were marriedi- in my uncle's house, and left it with his blessing apd good wishes." "That's right; you must excuse my asking, but you somehow looked so young and delicate for such a life as you're come to, that I couldn't help thinking that it must o' been a love-match." Rosalie did not say that she hoped it was a love- match, and the landlady departed on her errand. When she entered, bringing a tin basin and a crash towel, she put them down upon the chest, and said: "I forgot to tell you that there are four bachelors aleep in the fore part of the room." %.   Rosalie looked up, surprised and shocked. ThisS feature of western life was quito new to her, and she was totally unprepared for it. The hostess saw her expression, and hastened to say -"OOhl they're very nice, steady young men; they won't make a noise, and keep you awake." "But have you no private room unoccupied? Your house seems large; I should think there were at leas four chambers on this floor?"         / "Lor' bless you, child, so there are; but the floors  ain't laid to none o them except this one, which is the reason I have to put so many in it. Bless you, you mus'n't mind such things out here-nobody does-- 'tain't like where you come from, you know. And now, child, if there's nothing else I can do for you, I hope you'll excuse me, for indeed I am so tired I am almost ready to drop." "Certainly; indeed, I am sorry to have given you so much trouble. Good night!"  ^ "Good night!" said the hostess, taking up her caIn- dle, and disappearing through the opening folds of thei blanket. (  Rosalie did not wish to sleep. The not unpleasant  ! restlessness, induced by a new, and strange position, drove sleep for a time from her eyes. She drew thef chest to the only window in her part of the room, andi sat down, and opened it, and looked outripon the dark  green prairie, that seemed to roll out like the ocean to meet the eastern horizon, where the harvest moon was  just rising. The full moon! It was the only familiar object that met her eyes in all the strange, wild, lonely, beautiful scene-the only old acquaintance-the only thing she had known at home! Tears-but not of   &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7865-00000124"/> sadness-rushed to her eyes. And then she thought of the vicissitudes of the last two years, and especially of the last two mohths; of her life of almost oriental luxury in the valley of the Pearl; of hei home in the mountains of Virginia, where she was surrounded by  all the advantages of wealth, taste, elegace, and cor.'  fort-where the eyes of affection watched her otions  all day long, and many servants waited on her lightest bidding; and then of thfe roughness and ruggedness of her present lot. But not in repining, and not in regret did she compare these various phases of her life. She was happy if ever young wife was so. She  looked upon the prairie, bathed in the silvery splen  dour of moonlight, with its mystio boundaries lost un-  der. the horizon, and its vastness and vagueness cast a glamour over her imagination, and charmed her with the fancy of wandering on and on in quest of its un- rnown limits, or as far as the vanishing boundaries night entice her. In the midst of these eyrie reveries leep surprised her, and her fair head sank upon her lded handson the window-sill. She was awakened by a -gentle clasp 'around her raist and a gentle voice in her ear, saying- -- "Rosalie-asleep at the window with the night ews alling on your head?" Sh started, lashed,' smiled, and exclaimed, iO  lark,is it yet? I amn so glad that you hav    i )melve He let down the window, and placed his hand upon ir head to see if it was damp, and asked-- "Why did yea not go to rest, Rosalie?" "Why, at first I was not sleepy; and I hearl that  are were strangers in the next room--or, rather, on   the other side of the blankets-and it seemed so odd.) I could not get used to the thought in a minute,  Mark." He answered with a laugh and said, as he looked around- l Yes, it is rather a rude place, wlrthather primitive accommodations, for the first and best hotel in the great city of Shelton. But, never mind; wait a bit. In a year or two you shall see this house 'well and completely,finished, within and without, and the rooms all properly and comfortably fitted up and furnished, and the- establishment provided with suitable waiters and chamber-maids; and in half-a-dozen years the host will probably have made his fortune." "Well, Mark, and what success have you had this afternoon V?" a The best success. I have found a house, which I think will suit us exactly. Come to the window for' a moment again. Do you see, immediately under the moon, that distant grove, that looks as if it were jug]. against the horizon? You see the trees stand up'    straight and dark against the sky?" "Yes, I see it." "That is Wolf's Grove. It is not more than three miles from here. I can easily walk the distance twice a-day. There is one building on the spot-a. large log cabin, that was put up for a meeting-house, but has fallen into disuse since the rise of this village, The cabin is in good repair, and I have already en- gaged it. So, dear wife, we have onl &amp;wait for the arrival of our little furniture, to go to housekeeping.

"A summer lodge amid the wild."--Bryant. "JUDGE I your plunder's come-landed from the 'Sachem' this morning " were the words with which  the landlord greeted Mark Sutherland, as the latter, with Rosalie, descended to breakfast. "Judge!" echoed Rosalie, looking inquiringly from one to the other. Mark Sutherland laughed, and pinched her arm; and when their host had moved off in another direc- tion, said:   . "Nonsense, Rose. Yes, it was I whom he addressed   as Judge-of course it was. Every one gets an hono- rary title of distinction here. I don't know what it is given for; certainly not to confer honour, but rather, I suppose, for the sake of civil brevity, as it is easier to say 'Judge' than 'Mr. Thompson.' Now, if I had ever belonged to any military company-if only as private in militia, they'd dub me here ' Cap'n,' if not 'Major,' or 'Gen'l:' and if I were county constable, instead of law student, they must still call me Judge.'"  And just then, as if in illustration of Mr. Suther- land's words, several men entered, eagerly inquiring "or " the Colonel," meaning the landlord. And when  the host came  forward to know their will, several speaking equally together, exclaimed:    "Colonel, we want your guns, and; your dogs, and:; your company, this morning, to hunt a pack of wolves- that chased Jones's boy almost into the village!" "A pack of wolves!" exclaimed the boarders,  gathering around, "Jones's boy!" ejaculated the landlord, in amaze- i ment.: "Riding from McPherson's mill ;" "So close, they caught at the boy's boots ;" "Foremost one hung upon the horse's flanks;" "Wounded ;" "Nothing but the animal's speed saved him;" "Wet with sweat;" "Miraculous 'scape;" "Jones's boy," &amp;6., were the broken sentences with which the tale was told by the several informants, all  speaking at once. "Well, friends, long as there's no damage done, I don't see any use in being so excited. As to my guns and dogs, you can have them in welcome; but as to my company, I have promised the Judge here to drive him and his wife over to see their house.- And I expect they will want me to haul the plunder over too-won't you, Judge?"  Mark Sutherland bowed.  After a little discussion, they urged "the Ju4lgt + to join their hunt, and Rosalie priviately squeezed Mark's arm in disapproval. Mark declined; and, after a little more altercation, the visitors at length departed, with three or four of the bachelor boarders, whg   . quaffed each a "hasty" cup of coffee and followed. When this little disturbance was over-- . -A "I did not know," said Mr..Sutherland, "that the -   &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7865-00000126"/> wild denizens of the forest ever ventured so near the settlements." "No more they don't," replied the host; "'only this go, I s'pose, the Injuns have been hunting of 'em and druv 'em close on to the village. We'll git shut of 'em agin after a bit." When breakfast was over, "the Colonel" geared up the carryall to take his young guests across the prairie to Wolf's Grove. It was a fresh, bright, blithe morning, scarcely seven o'clock, when they set out and the prairie still glistened with dew. There was no road to Wolf's Grove; but the driver took a bee- line over the level ground, and the wheels of the carry- all tracked deep through the sedgy grass and gorgeous wild flowers. "It looks strange to me," said Rosalie, "to see these glorious flowers--which, if they were in our eastern gardens, we should cherish with so much care -driven down     and crushed by thousands under our wheels.",- "It is but the sign of the fall of the forest before the advancing march of immigration," observed Mark. "It reminds me, somehow, of the triumphal entries of the sanguinary old conquerors of ancient times, whose chariot wheels passed ruthlessly over the fallen, the dead, and the dying." Mark smiled at her fancy, and the driver took his pipe out of his mouth, and turned and looked at her in perplexity. "But, Rose, when you look around you at the countless millions of flowers left blooming-nay, I mean to say, when you think of the countless millions   THE LOG CABIN.              269 of trees left standing--does it not give you an exultant sense of the exhaustless wealth, the boundless resources of our prairies and forests ?" "I know something inspires me with unlimited hope just now. There is, certainly, as far as the com- forts and elegances of civilized life are concerned, a look of great privation in the village and among the peo- ple we have just left. And yet-and yet-whether it is because the inhabitants are mostly young and full of health and hope, or that the houses are all new, or that the primeval wealth and exuberance of nature is not only undiminished, but almost untouched; whethermit is any or all of these causes, I do not know, but certainly to me there is about this country an air of youth, vigor, hope, promise, unlimited, indescribable I I feel its influence, without being able to explain it. It seems to me that here, the age, the weariness, and the sorrow of the old world has been left behind. That this is a breaking out in a new-place, or rather that this country and people, and we ourselves, are a new creation, fresh from the hand of God, and with a new promise I Let us be faithful to our part of the covenant. Oh, let us be faithful; let no sin, selfish- ness, injustice of ours cause us to lose the glorious promise !" A pressure of the hand, at once approving, kind, and warning, from Mark Sutherland, remiinded Rosalie that they were not alone. A little farther on, the sprightly eyes of the girl lighted upon a large, speckled bird, standing still, almost in their road. "What a beautiful bird! What is it?" inquired Rosalie. &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7865-00000127"/> 270  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVEK. "It's a prairie chicken. Now, I want you just to take notice o' that creetur; it won't take the trouble to move-you'll see," said the man, driving slowly past, and leaving the bird behind them, standing still. "They must be very tame," said Rosalie. "No, they ain't nyther, but they've got a heap o' sense. We are driving. Now, if I had o' been afoot with a gun, or anything that looks like a gun to it- say a stick-why, it would a-taken wing in a minute. I'ye took notice of it often and often. Same case with a deer-it'll sFand right still and look at you going past with your team; but only just let it catch its eyes on you when you're walking 'long o' your gun, and it's off in an instant. Well knowing of that, you see, I often just quietly lays my gun down in the bottom of the wagon, to be ready for the creeturs." In desultory talk like this, which nevertheless gave our young immigrants some little insight into the manners of the country, they passed, over the three miles of intervening prairie land, and entered Wolf's Grove. Wolf's Grove was not what its name indicated--an isolated piece of wood, similar to those that at wide intervals dotted the prairie; it was rather a portion of that vast, unbroken, interminable forest, projecting here into the open prairie like a point of land into the sea, but stretching back anl[ back hundreds of miles, and even to the banks of Lake Superior. Here the old primeval forest trees were of gigantic, almost fabulous size, but thinly scattered, and standing singly apart, like the outpostskof a vast army.  Half a mile within the Grove, where the trees were   'XJl J JLIUJ'  ^DaL^, . .i . thicker, stood the cabin originally built for a school and meeting-house, by the first settlers. There was not a wood-shed, a fence, a fruit tree, nor a foot of cultivated ground, around it; nor a house, nor a field, within three miles of it. Mark Sutherland and Rosalie alighted, and entered the house, while the driver secured his' horses and gave them water. The cabin was unusually large and  well built, being nearly thirty feet square, and con- structed of huge logs, well hewn, and well cemented. The cabin fronted south, where one door admitted into the only room; opposite this door, in the north wall, stood the large, open fire-place. The room was lighted by two windows, fronting each other, east and west. The floor was well lai, and a step-ladder in the corner, between the fire-place and the east window, led up to a loft. The house was in good repair, with the single exception of the broken windows. "A very different abode from that you have left, for my sake, dear Rosalie; and yet, if you only knew, as I do, how much better this is than any other log cabin to be found anywhere  Why, Rose, it is a palace, compared to some." "I know it is; and I only wonder that it has been left so long untenanted, while the meanest hovels have been all taken up." "Why, you see, my dear, this housde is too remote from the village for any one but a farmer, and as it stands upon the reserved school lands, of course, no farmer can cultivate the ground." "Will it not be too far for you?" "With me it is different. I like to walk, and do  not grudge my steps. The three miles' walk, morniig   &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7865-00000128"/> 272  INDIA.

My only anxiety will be in leaving you here alone, all day. Will you be very- lonesome, dear?1 "Lonesome? I don't know. I should be lonesome anywhere without you, Mark. But that is a very fool- ish weakness, and must be overcome, of course." "But you will be afraid to stay here all day long alone?" "Afraid? Of what? Why should I be? Is there any cause of fear?" 'No, dear; no cause for fear; but, as Emilia said of jealousy, one might say of feAr: ' That fearful souls will not be answered so; They are not ever fearful for a cause, But fearful for they are fearful'"-- "Well, I am not afraid with or without a cause. A child would not be afraid in this quiet place," said Rosalie, going to one of the windows, and looking out  into the waving wdods. "How still-how very still-no sound to be heard but the rustle of the leaves and the ripple of water, that must be near!" she continued, looking from the window, while Mark walked about the room and made notes of glass, putty, a door latch, and such little matters that would be needed to be brought out with their furniture. Then they went out where the driver stood watering his horses, and where the only sigh of previous human presence was afforded by the narrow grass-grown path, leading down into a deep dingle, where the ripple of water was heard.   THE LOG CABST.       278 "If you'd like a drink, there's one of the finest springs in the whole country down there," said the landlord, taking a tin cup from the wagon and handing it to Mark. Rosahe was already going down the path. They reached the spring, and found the water cold and clear as crystal. They drank, and congratulated themselves upon this great blessing, and then went up to the cabin, and, as their host was in a hurry to be off, they entered the carryall to return to the village. "Well, are you going to take it?" asked the driver, looking around as he took the reins and started. "Why, of course. I had already taken it." "I knowed that; but I thought when she saw how lonesome it was, she'd object. 'Tain't many women- I can tell you that-who'd agree to live out there, by themselves, in that lonesome place, and you gone all day long." "I am sure my wife prefers it to an. inferior cabin nearer the village." "Yes, indeed, I do," said Rosalie. "Well, every one to their taste," observed the landlord, cracking his whip, and making his horses fly. They reached home in good time for dinner. The afternoon was employed by Mark Sutherland  in collecting together necessary provisiohs, to be taken with their furniture to the cabin; and"by Rosalie- seated by the window of her part of the upper chamber -in hemming napkins, preparatory to her housekeep- ing, and in looking out upon the prairie basking in the afternoon sun, and upon her distant home, Wolf's Grove. In the evening the hunters returned from an unsuc-  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7865-00000129"/> 274  INDIA.

But the curiosity of the hostess, and the perseverance of the host, at last elicited from them the fact that they had not even hit upon the track of the wolves. The next day was fixed upon by Mark Sutherland and his wife for their removal to Wolf's Grove. CHAPTER XXT. GOING TO HOUSEKEEPING. ALL the forenoon of the next day, Mr. Garner, the landlord, was absent with his team; so that our young people were obliged to defer their removal until the afternoon; and they spent the intervening hours in reviewing their possessions and supplying those few last articles that always are forgotten in a first pre- paration. At two o'clock, the capacious wagon of the hotel stood before the door, laden with furniture, trunks, provisions, and so forth. A tolerable seat wap arranged for Rosalie among the baggage; but Mark, on foot, accompanied the landlord, who walked at the head of his horses. It was a slow progress; the horses, already fatigued with their morning's work, never got out of a walk; so that it was nearly four o'clock when they entered Wolf's Grove and drew up before the log cabin. While his horses were resting, Mr. Garner   GOING TO HOUSEKEEPING.     275 assisted Mark to unlade the wagon, and take in the furniture and arrange the heaviest part of it. Then, having watered his horses, he shook hands with his late guests, wished them good luck, jumped upon his seat in front of the wagon, and drove off. And Mark and Rosalie found themselves standing, looking at each other, alone, in the forest cabin. It was a moment in which flashed back upon each the memory of their whole past lives, and the intense realization of their present position. A doubt, whether to weep or smile, quivered over Rosalie's features for an instant. Mark saw the tremor of her lips and eye-  lids, and drew her to his heart; and she dropped her  head upon his shoulder and smiled through her tears.  He whispered, cheerily-  "Never mind, dear; you will be one of the honoured  pioneer women of the West. And when this wilder-   1 ness is a great Commonwealth, and Shelton is a great city, and I am an old patriarch, we will have much joy in telling of the log cabin in the wilderness, where we first went to housekeeping. And now, let us see if we cannot get this place into a little order." The room, as I said, was large and square, with a  window east and west, facing each other, and a stone fire-place north, facing a broad door south. The walls were unplastered, but well planed and cemented, and grey with time and use. The floor was of rough but sound pine plank. A broad shelf over the fire-place served for a mantel-piece. In the corner between the east window and the fire-place stood the step-ladder leading to the loft. In the opposite corner, between the west window and the fire-place, were three tria-  i gular shelves, that did duty as cupboard or beauebt.  . \  .                . .  . S-  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7865-00000130"/> 2 6  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. Finuily, the sashes of the windows were good, but the glass was all broken out of them. This was the state of the room when Mark and Rosalie looked around it. Mark went up the step-ladder to examine the loft, but found it so low that even a woman could not stand upright in it. It was therefore given up, -except as a place to stow trunks, boxes, &amp;c. f  Then they began to arrange their furniture. It was very easily done, they had so little-a bedstead with its appointments, a table, a half-dozen chairs, and almost everything else in half-dozens. The form of the room favoured the convenient arrangement of these things. The bedstead had already been put up in the corner between the west window and the door, and the table placed in the corresponding corner be- tween the door and the east window. They set the chairs in their places, and then Mark began to unpack the china, while Rosalie arranged it on the shelves of the corner cupboard. There were several things- remnants of' past refinement-out of keeping with their present condition; among them, the French china-that looked upon their rough pine shelves as the elegant Mark Sutherland and the fair and delicate Rosalie looked in their rude log cabin-and the superb white Marseilles counterpanes, whose deep fringes touched the rough plank floor; and the tester and valance of fine and beautiful net-work; and lastly., the tamboured curtains that lay upon the chairs, ready to be put up when Mark should have nmended tlic windows. These were certainly out of place here, blut it could not be helped; they were Rosalie's little per- sonal effects, endeared to her by long possession, anld by their having been the property, and some of them   GOING TO HOUSEKEEPING.     2T -the tamboured curtains and the net valance, for in-  stance-the handiwork of her mother. By sunset, all was arranged, except two matters-the broken win- dows, with which now the young master of the house began to employ himself, taking out the sashes and laying them upon the table, and laying pane after pane in their places; and the barrel of flour which stood in the middle of the floor, with a quarter of beef- laid across the top of it-both waiting to be put away out of sight, in a proper place; that is, supposing a proper place could be found on premises where there was neither storehouse, pantry, nor shed, nor even a second room. Mark busied himself with the window sashes, trying  pane after pane in the empty forms. But at length,  turning round, he smiled and said- "It's I use, Rose; I'm not a glazier, and so care- fully as I thought I measured the sashes and the glass, they will not exactly fit; and I have no diamond here to trim them, and so I suppose they must be left until  to-morrow."  And he replaced the empty sashes in the window   I frames. Then, seeing the neglected barrel of flour, he wheeled it up against the wall, near the door, and said it must remain there for the present; and Rosalie took a coarse, clean table-cloth and spread it over- the beef, that still lay upon the top.    -  "And now, dear," he said, looking around, "I be- lieve we are as well fixed as we can be for the present. Nothing remains but to get supper; and, as I was out here in the West two years before you ever saw it, I ] shouldn't wonder if I hadn't to give you some in-   i struction."  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7865-00000131"/> 278  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVBi. "You teach me to cook I ;, my uncle's housekeeper for two years, while you were wandering about from town to town!" exclaimed Rosalie. Mark laughed, and bade her remember that when she was "uncle's" housekeeper she had experienced cooks at her command, and that her housekeeping duties and responsibilities consisted in carrying the keys and ordering what she pleased to have for dinner. And he further advised her to recollect that she was not to snap up her liege lord in that way, either! Whereupon Rose bade him mind his business and his briefs; for that she should snap him, and box his ears, too, whenever the spirit moved her. She! Mark snatched her, laughing, to his bosom, and -half suffo- cated her with kisses, and then holding her tight, bade her do her wickedest. "And, Rose," he exclaimed merrily, "I do not know why it is; but out here, in this cabin of the wilderness, with nobody but you for company, I feel as if the restraints of society and of maturity had fallen away, and restored me to the freedom and the wilfulness and the irresponsible wickedness of my boyhood. And oh! little one, if you were only a great deal taller and stronger, what a wrestle we would have!" And he gazed down on her there, standing within his arms-so small, so fair, so perfectly helpless, so utterly in his power-and all the wantonness of youth fled from before her helplessness and her beauty, and a flood of unutterable tenderness rushed over his heart; and, still gazing upon her with infinite love, he said- "God forever bless you-you little, little, wee thing;    you delicate, beautiful creature; and God forever for- sake me, if ever, willingly, I give you a moment's pain or sorrow I' Blushing deeply, Rose withdrew herself from his now yielding clasp, and, to cover her girlish embar- rassment, took the new bucket and put it in his hands,  requesting him to go to the spring, and bring her fresh water to fill the tea-kettle, and adding-  "You shall see what nice biscuits and what nice tea  I can make."  Mark took the pail and went out, and disappeared down the path.  Rosalie, observing the floor littered, looked around  for the broom to sweep it up; and then laughed  to find that, with all their getting, they had got no broom. Mark came in with the pail of water, set it down, and said he would go and get some brush to kindle a fire. And while he was gone, Rosalie put water in a basin to wash her hands preparatory to making the biscuits; and then she discovered that they had for- gotten soap also. And while she stood in dismay, wondering what else might have been omitted, Mark re-entered with a pile of brush on his shoulders, " like Christian with his bundle of sin," he said. He threw  it down upon the heartk, and began to look around, and then he broke into a gay, prolonged laugh. -  "What's the matter, Mark? Are you daring to laugh at le, with my sleeves and skirt tucked up?"  $ "O, Rosalie, we have heads, child! we have heads -and so have cabbages, when they have come to   - maturity."  -  He  - '.

"Well, don't laugh yours off your shoulders, but tell me what you're laughing at /" "We have not brought a match nor a candld." Oh I no I You don't say -so?" "It is a positive fact." "We have forgotten soap and brooms too; we have forgotten everything." "No, not everything; only a few things that make everything useless." "What's to be done? We can't cook supper to- night, or even breakfast to-morrow morning, without a fire." "No. Let's see-I know if one rubs two pieces of wood together long enough, they will ignite; and I know of other processes by which fire may be kindled; but, after all, I think the quickest and the surest way will be for me to go back to Shelton this evening, and get the matches; and then I can also get soap, a broom, and my pistols, which were likewise for- gotten." "Go back to Shelton this evening! Walk three miles to Shelton, and back this evening, and the sun already down! You will be tired to death." "No, dear; I can walk that three miles in about an hour, get the things in ten minutes; borrow Mr. Garner's saddle-horse to ride back, and take him home again in the morning, when I go to the office. And my brave little girl will not be afraid to stay here a a few hours by herself?" "Afraid? No; surely not." "You can fasten the door with this wooden pin, if you wish to do so." "Oh! I shall not wish to fasten the door. I shall   GOING TO HOUSEKEEPING.     281 sit on the sill and watch the stars, and see if I can read our future destiny on their orbs, and wait for the moon to rise, and for you to come." ' No, you must not do that, Rose. The woods are damp, and the evening air chill. And, now I think of it, this cabin will be too cool for you, with this draught through the open windows. Let's see if we cannot do something with them. If you had anything to tack up against them, Rosalie?" She went to a box and took out two sheets, each of which, doubled, was tacked against a window, and be- cause the breeze still lifted them, a few tacks were driven in the sides and bottoms of these temporary blinds, to keep them down. Having finished that job, Mark pulled down and buttoned his wristhands, put   ' on his coat, kissed Rosalie, bade her keep up her heart, for that he should be back at ten, or a little after, and departed. She stood at the door, watching him, until he disappeared within the intervening trees, and then she turned and entered the darkening house. Did Mark Sutherland-did Rosalie-dream of all that should happen before they should meet again? Did either imagine them grim horror of the next few hours? It was a night that one of them never, in after life, forgot-whose fearful memory haunted thoughts by day, and visions by night, when the dreamer would start from sleep, and, with convulsive shivers and cold perspiration, gaze around in terror that could not be reassured.

It was very dark, for twilight had departed, and the moon had not yet arisen. Although the door and windows were closed, the room was still suffi- ciently cool, and Rosalie might have remained plea. santly seated in her sole rocking chair, and wrapped in reverie, through all the lonely hours until her husband should return, but for one trifling circumstance; tri- fling in itself, yet fraught with the most appalling dan. ger, and the most ghastly consequences. The fresh carnal smell of that quarter of newly-killed beef that lay across the top of the barrel, only lightly covered over with the table-cloth, began to fill the closed room, and soon became intolerable to Rosalie's fine senses. For the sake of fresh, pure air, she went and opened the door, and sat down upon the door step.  There she sat, gazing into the dark mysterious depths of the ( forest, or up to the deep blue, starlit- sky, listening to the chirp of the field-cricket, the grass-hopper, and the katydid, those merry little night warblers, who 61eil, their concerts when the birds have finished theirs-- and remembering all her past life, enjoying her pre- sent, and dreaming and noping of the future.

And she thought of their future; it might bring toil, privation, penury, disappointment, and death, but it could not deprive her of the jewel of her soul, LOVE. That word-that idea-was still the cen- tre of her soul's circle, around which thought and feel- ing still revolved. She sank into a dim, delicious reve- rie, and, wrapped in blissful dreams, the world around her disappeared. The cheerful chirp of the crickets and the katydids was no longer heard--the deep blue,  star-lit sky no longer watched-the dark, mysterious   forest, with its ever untrodden depths; no longer seen. She was like a slumberer "smiling as in delightful visions, on the brink of a dread chasm." There was a far-off, light,: multitudinous tramp, like the patter of distant rain-drops. She knew it not, she heard it not. "Senseless as the dead was she, to all around, beneath, above." Senseless as th-e dead-aye, sense- less as the dead-to the near approach-of a dreadful death i Oh, surely this was not her unguarded hour I ^ She would not be left to perish in her youth and    beauty-to perish while wrapped in her visions of   i love and devotion.

A singular low noise caught her ear, and ceased. "That sounds like a sudden fall of rain stopped," she said, and paused to listen. Not hearing the noise again, she closed the door; and without in the least degree intending to do it, quite mechanically she did the wisest thing that could have been done. She barred the door, and then she seated herself once more in the rocking-chair. The room was intensely dark. The faint light that stole in at the sheeted window only seemed a thinner blackness. She sat gently rocking to and fro, and gradually relapsing into reverie. It was soon rudely broken through. Still like the sudden heavy fall of rain-drops on forest leaves, mul- titudinous footsteps thronged pattering around the cabin-pawing at its walls I Startled, astonished, yet. not alarmed, Rosalie listened. Then a low ground swell of a growl arose, murmuring on the air,; and thrilling every nerve with awe. It was low, deep, and threatening, as the thrilling bass string of the harpsi- chord when rudely swept by some idler's hand. Rosalie stood up; and, resting her hand upon the rocking-chair, listened more intently. The sound ceased-all was still as death. She crept cautiously to the window, and, pulling aside slightly the edge of the sheet-blind, where it was tacked to the side of the frame, she looked out. The night was deeply dark, though the sky was still studded with stars-the ground was also lighted withar--twin star s, scattered all   A NIGHT OF FEAR.       285 about. At first sight she took these for lightning- bugs; but, as she gazed, she knew them to be the, phosphoric, excited eyes of couchant wild beasts. And, at the same instant that she made this appalling discovery, the whole pack burst, in full cry, upon the cabin, tearing at the walls, and howling furiously with hunger, rage, and frantic desire. Rosalie tottered back to her chair, and sank into it. The whole horrible truth, in all its detail of cause, effect, and consequence, burst with overwhelming force upon her senses. It was a pack of hungry wolves l--the same pack that the Indian hunters had pursued into the neighbourhood of Shelton--the same pack that had been the terror of the settlement since their discovery near it. They had been drawn to the cabin by the scent of blood from the newly-killed beef, and -there was no, light in the house to fright them off. Sick- oh, sick, and nearly swooning with deadly terror- Rosalie still charged her soul "to hold her body strengthened" for the crisis. She looked around in the darkness, trying to think of some- means of defence, security, or escape, but found none. If she should open the door and fly from  the house, she must inevitably fall an instant victim to their rapacity. That plan was rejected at once, as not to be thought of, except as the drowning think of catching at straws. Andi then her eyes flew wildly around in the darkness for means of defence or. retreat. Alas! there was not a chance of either. She could go up into the loft, or climb up into the chimney, or - bury herself in the bed; but an instant's reflection. :. convinced her that there was no place within the walls to which the fell wolves would not climb with more a A  ' '    : 4  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7865-00000135"/> 286  INDIA. THE PEABL OF PEARL RIVER. facility than she could, and no retreat to which their keen scent would not guide them, and from which they would not drag her to death. And oh! in the midst of all her desperate thoughts, their frantic onsets to the walls, their horrible baying, barking, and tear- ing, nearly drove her mad with terror. Every instant she expected death! How thin, how slight the barrier that kept them out! The moment they should chance to strike the broken windows, protected only by the thin sheets, and so find the way of entrance, that very moment must the cabin be filled by the hungry and ravening beasts. For an instant, perhaps, the beef, whose scent had drawn them' to the spot, might divert them from herself, but only for an instant, for that flesh would be swiftly torn in pieces and devoured; and then what a fate would be hers To perish so sharply and suddenly, and by such a ghastly death l And not of herself alone did she think in that hour of dread, but of all whom her death would appal and afflict; and of him, oh! of him whom it would most awfully bereave. For herself-for her own person- it would not be so dreadful,-after all, she thought. The sharp agony would soon be over-in a very few minutes most likely-and then all that was mortal and perishable of her-her small, frail body-would be totally destroyed; and her soul, she trusted, would be at rest. But, of the distant loved ones, whose hearts would thrill with horror at hearing of her fate, and ofthim whose life would be made desolate by her loss -pwhose arm, whose brain would be stricken power- less by the terrible doom of her who was at once his inspiration and his object-this, oh! this was the bit- terness of death! But ohl the frightful, the mad.   A NIGHT OP FEAR.      287 dening howls of the demoniacs outside scattered all her thoughts so quickly, it was impossible to reflect to any good end. But suddenly athwart the stormy chaos of deafening noise, despairing terror, and dis- tracting thought, darted, like lightning, an inspira- tion! She had grown conscious that the storm out- side had drawn itself to a point nearest the spot where the barrel and the meat stood; and the wolves were scratching and tearing furiously, and hurling them- selves at the wall, baying all the while in full cry, or barking and fighting among themselves, like demons. And now her idea was further to decoy them from the windows, the weak parts of the cabin. She went to the barrel. She could not lift the quarter of beef, but she pushed it off, letting it fall heavily upon the floor. For an instant the noise outside ceased, but soon burst forth again with renewed violence. She dragged the beef close as she could get it to the door, and then she got a knife, and close to the .floor she cut the flesh in gashes, so that the juices might run under the door to the outside, and draw and hold the frantic wolves to that spot. For this she knew was the safest place of attack-it was the farthest removed from the windows, and the door was too strong and well barred to give way. She knew this, but yet when it rattled violently at their furious assaults, her very heart nearly died within her. s She thought of her husband's return with extreme anxiety; she feared full as much as she hoped it. She  had perfect faith in his courage and presence of mind, and she knew, besides, he would be well armed when he should return; and yet she sickened with fear for i hint when she thought of that return.

It was still pitch dark, but she went to the chimney shelf, and opened the clock, and with her delicate fingers and nice touch she felt for the hour and the minute hands, and for the raised figures, and ascertained that it was already after ten. She felt again, and was sure there was no mistake. After tell, and Mark not yet returned I What could have detained him? i This source of anxiety was beginning to add its sting to the others, when a new ground of alarm, of despair, fixed her panic-stricken where she stood. The wolves, who had not ceased to howl and cry, and hurl themselves against the walls, now led by a surer instinct, were careering around and around the cabin, leaping up at the walls, and leaping up at the window- sashes, which shook at each bound I The clamour out- side was now deafening, appalling. She heard the frail sashes shake-she heard them give way-she heard the whole hungry, horrible pack burst with full cry into the room; and mortal terror whirled away her consciousness, and, with an agonizing cry to Heaven, she fell to the floor insensible. When consciousness came back, Rosalie found herself lying upon her bed. The room was quiet, cool. and dimly lighted by a candle on the hearth, whose glare was shaded from her eyes by an inter- vening chair with a shawl thrown over it. Mark was standing by her, bathing her face with cold water. As memory returned, she shuddered violently several times; and her first words, gasped out, were, "The wolves I Oh! the wolves 1"   A NIGHT OF FEAR.       289 "They are gone, love; put to flight!" -said Mark Sutherland, soothingly.

"How did it happen, Mark?" she questioned, as he laid her head once more upon the pillow. "What happen, love?" "My escape, your safety, and the flight of the wolves."' "Dear Rose, we had better not revert to the subject again to-night. Try to compose yourself." "I cannot I If I close my eyes and lie still, I hear again those dreadful howls-I see again those glaring eyes and ghastly fangs-I live over again the terrible - danger."

I hurried on as fast as possible, and soon came upon the cabin, and found a pack of perhaps a dozen wolves baying around the house, and leaping and scratching at the walls. They were prairie wolves-a small, cowardly race-who go in packs, and who are generally very easily driven off. I first of all picked up and threw a billet of wood at them, I forgot, dear Rose, that our window had no better defence than a sheet, or else I never thought of it at all, for when I threw the piece of wood, it not only passed through the pack of wolves, but on through the window-place, too--scattering the animals, but also making an opening, through which several of them, in their efforts to escape, leaped into the house" "It was then I fainted," said Rosalie. "I found you lying on the floor, insensible." "But you and the wolves?" "A very short skirmish served to put the enemy to flight. I succeeded in killing only two of them-two that had leaped before me in at the window-the others escaped." As Rosalie continued to tremble, he added: "They are really not a formidable antagonist, my dear. I have heard a pioneer say, that he would as lief as not tumble himself, unarmed, down into a dingle full of them, and trust'to his muscular strength and courage to conquer. That might have been all boasting; still I know they are a dastardly race; and if you had known it, and could have raised a great noise, and thrown some heavy missiles among them   CABIN-r rPIZNG.       291 from the loft above, you would have put them all to flight."  "Ah, but if they had got in while I lay here in-' sensible from terror, they would have destroyed me," ' thought Rosalie. But, unwilling to give pain, she ,: -:- withheld the expression .of those terrible thoughts. More words of soothing influence Mark dropped into her ear, until at length her spirits were calmed, and she was enabled to join him in earnest thanks- giving to Heaven for their preservation. He fanned her till she dropped asleep. And then, late as it was, he went and busied himself with many things that remained to be done--putting glass in the windows, cutting up and salting down the nearly fatal quarter of beef, ripping off the head of the barrel of flour, &amp;c.-and doing all so quietly as not to disturb the   ? sleeper.                        - -- . --- CHAPTER    XXIII.

They had anticipated MP  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7865-00000138"/> 292  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. toil and privation, and had thought they were pre. pared to meet them. But it is one thing to think in a general way about work and want, and quite another to feel them in all their irritating and exhausting details; and the first day of housekeeping in the forest log cabin taught them this difference. They had no garden, no cow, no poultry, and there was no market where to procure the necessaries that these should have supplied. Everything that could be bought at the village shops had been provided; yet their first breakfast consisted of coffee without cream or milk, and biscuits without butter. But mutual love, and hope, and trust, sweetened the meal, and even their little privations furnished matters of jest. And when breakfast was over, and Mark was preparing to bid his "little sweetheart," as he called her, farewell for the day, and ,promising to return by four o'clock, she gaily asked him what he would likce for dinner, and he replied by ordering a bill of fare, that might have been furnished by some famous Eastern or European hotel. Suddenly, in the midst of their merriment, she thought of the wolves and trembled-yet restrained the expres- sion of her fears. But the eye of affection read her thoughts, and Mark hastened to assure her that there was no more to dread-that the cabin was the last place on earth that the same animals would seek again -that they would not come within sight of its smok- ing chimney. Her trust in his judgment and his truthfulness completely reassured her doubting heart, and set it at perfect rest. And she let him go to his business with a gay, glad smile. She watched him winding up the little narrow path, and disappearing among the trees, and then she turned   CABIST-KEEPING.      293 into the house, to wash up the breakfast service and -et the room in order.

After arrang- ing her corner cupboard and sweeping her room, and making a few little alterations and improvements in the disposition of her lighter furniture, she unpacked her sewing materials and sat down in the door t9 needlework. The primeval forest all around her, even up to the house, the blue sky above, and the log cabin, in the door of which she sat, was all that met the eye; the trilling songs of the wood birds, and the ripple-ripple of the trickling spring in the deep dell near, was all that met the ear. And yet she was not lonesome-she loved this solitude-the manifest pre- sence of God filled it, and heart and mind received the holy, the elevating, the joyous influence. The day advanced-the sparkling freshness of the morning mellowed into noon. And then she got up and took a pitcher and went down to the spring, that seemed to have been calling her in its merry voice all the morning. A narrow, steep path down into the dingle led to the spring, and beyond it arose a high hill, heavily wooded, like all the land about there. She filled her pitcher, and returned to the house to take her lonely noontide luncheon. And then, as the meridian sun was pouring its rays in at the door, which you know faced the south, sh&amp; removed hier needlework to the west window, and resumed her sewing. Day waned; nor was she conscious of. its waning until the burning sun began to glance in at her through the window where she sat, and. oblige her to cake her work to the opposite one-smiling at  : the conceit of being chased from place to place by /  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7865-00000139"/> 294-  INDIA, TSE PEARL OF PEARL RLVEi{. Apollo. She sat at the cool east window, until the striking of the clock warned her that it was time to prepare the afternoon meal, which was to comprise "dinner and supper together." She arose, and put away her work. But what was there to be got for dinner, after all? Tea without milk, bread without butter, and salted beef without vegetables. A poor meal certainly to set before an epicurean, such as Mr. Sutherland had been, for of herself she never thought. Suddenly she recollected having seen some wild plum trees growing on the hill beyond the spring, and she knew the fruit should now be ripe, and she thought she would go and get some, to make a pie. No sooner thought than attempted. She seized her bonnet, caught up a little basket, and set out. She hastened down the dingle path, crossed the run, and climbed the hill. She reached its summit, and stopped to breathe, and rest for a moment. The sudden glory of the extended landscape held her spell-bound. On one side of the forest-a boundless ocean of waving greenery-spreading on and on, thousands of miles, for aught she knew, after it was lost under the horizon. On the other side, the vast prairie, with its dotted groves, like oases in desert, and in the distance the river, and the village, and the opposite shore of Mis- souri Territory. For a few minutes she stood in en- chanted admiration; and then, remembering that she had no time to lose, addressed herself to the errand upon which she came, promising herself, after tea, when they should be at leisure, to return with Mark, and view the landscape over by moonlight. The wild plum trees furnished a rich harvest. She had only   CABIN-KEEPING.       295 to shake the slight and graceful shaft, and a shower of ripe fruit fell around her. She quickly filled her basket; and then, with her girlish love of change, she returned to the house by another way. BY this little route through the thicket, she observed, late as it was in the season, a profusion of wild raspberries, of un- usual size and richness. She stopped, in pleased sur- prise, to gather them, and heaped them up on top of the plums, as many as theebasket would hold. Delighted with these woodland treasures-such a delicious addition to her frugal board-she returned to the cabin, and began to prepare their evening meAl. Rosahe had not superintended her uncle's Virginia farm-house for two years, to no purpose. She was a skilful little cook. It was not much to prepare a meal twice a day, for two persons; besides, her "good will was to it." And I doubt if, in all the elegance and luxury of her Southern home, she was ever gayer, gladder, happier, than when preparing, with her own hands, this first little supper in her log cabin. The meal was soon ready. The damask table linen and the delicate china that adorned the table, and the fair girl that hovered around it, I was about to say, were somewhat out of keeping with the house. But that would not have been true; for there was nothing mean, poor, or squalid, in the surroundings of the log cabin. It had a wild, woodland air-:there was as-yet nothing to offend the most aesthetic taste. The arrange- ment of the table was complete-the last things set upon it being the delicate pastry and the cut-glass bowl of raspberries, powdered with sugar. But, there was no cream or butter; and this was Rosalie's sole regret, as she gave a pleased glance at the whole effect,  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7865-00000140"/> 296  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. and then went to each window, and put aside the muslin curtains to let in the evening breeze, and the green woodland prospect. As she turned from the window, she was startled by a thump upon the floor, and the exclamation of-  "There she sent you these / And I wonder why you couldn't o' comed arter them yourself 1" And with astonishment Rosalie saw standing in the room a large, fair-complexioned, middle-aged man, clothed in coarse blue linen jacket and trousers, with a waiter's white apron tied before him. He had just thumped on the floor a large basket filled with vege- tables. He still held in his hand a tin pail, with a tin pan covered upon the top of it. "Who are you?" inquired she. "Billy. Here's the butter. Where am I to pour the milk?" said the man, lifting the little pan that contained a pound print, and displaying half a gallon of milk in the pail. "Who sent these?" asked Rose, in surprise. "She! Can't you empty the milk? I've got to carry the bucket back." "I am afraid there is some mistake," said Rose, hesi- tating. "Who did you say sent you?"  "Her, 'I tell you. I can't stand here gablin' all day." "But, my good friend, there is some error--these things were not sent to me," persisted Rosalie, looking longingly at the hard, sweet-smelling butter, with the dew rising on it. With no more ado, "Billy" marched up to the corner cupboard, seized a knife, passed it under the print of butter, and deftly turned the print out of thlo   CABIN- KEEPING.     i, 297 pan into a plate; next, he took up the pail and pourer, the milk into a pitcher; finally, he went back ane seized his basket, and seeing nothing, to receive the vegetables, just turned it upside down and shook them oat upon the floor-and potatoes, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, &amp;c., rolled in every direction. And "Billy" caught up his empty pan and pail and pitched them into the basket, and hitched the latter, with a jerk, upon his arm, and marched out of the door, exclaim- ing- '"Now, for the futur', mind, you must come arter 'em every day, yourself-if they're worth havin' they're vrorth comin' for, an' I've got 'nough to do for her, 'out trudgin' over here every day for you. An' I told her I wan't a-goin' to do it, nuther," &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. For long after Billy was out of sight in the woods, Rosalie heard the retreating sound of his grumbling. Full of wonder, she set about to collect the fugitive potatoes, tomatoes, &amp;c. She put them under the lower shelf of her cupboard, and drew the short white cur- tain before them; then she set the pitcher of rich milk and the plate of fresh butter u]on the table, much pleased with the unexpected luxury, but more pleased to anticipate the surprise and pleasure of Mark. And all being ready, she took her sewing, and sat in the door to watch for his coming. She heard his footstep before she saw his form; and she closed the door and ran up the woodland path to meet him. And soon their merry voices and silvery laughter echoed through the forest, as they approached the cabin. Rosahe had said nothing of her new luxuries; and when they entelredc the cabin, and he threw a glance around, and-  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7865-00000141"/> 298  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RI vE. dropped his eyes upon the table, first of all he caught and kissed Rose again for her affectionate care, and then, by his exclamations and questions, exhibited all the surprise and satisfaction that the most exacting little Rose could have desired. While they supped, Rosalie explained the mnystery of the plums and rasp- berries, and, after relating the visit of Billy, requested an explanation of the other mystery, of. the butter, milk, and vegetables, and expressed her fears that, after all, she had no right to tiA--that they were intended for some one eke. Mark reassured her by giving his opinion that hey were intended for her- self, and no other; and that she would find out, the next day, probably, the kind neighbour who had sent them. After supper was over and cleared away, and the young pair had rested awhile, and the moon had risen, they crossed the rill and went up the hill to enjoy the fine air and the extended view. And thus closed their first day at the log cabin. And the next morning Rosalie found out her kind neighbours O*   DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS.      299 9 CHAPTER XXIV. DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS. ' They grow in the world's approving eyes, In friendship's smile and home's caress: Collecting all the heart's sweet ties Into one knot of happiness."--Moore. THE next morning, after breakfast, while sitting alone in her cabin, engaged, as usual, in needlework, Rosalie received a call from her kind neighbour, Mrs. Attridge, whom she found to be the wife of the worthy proprietor of the neighbouring lead-smelting furnace. "Fat, fair, and forty," with a fund of good nature and good humour, in easy circumstances, and with much experience in Western life, this lady proved an in- valuable acquisition to Rosalie in the era of her cabin - trials. Her frank, gay, and homely manner invited confidence. She pressed upon her young neighbour the freedom of her garden and her dairy, for as long as the latter chose to avail herself of the privilege, or until she should have cows and a garden of her own -telling her that it was the custom of the settlers to accommodate each other in that way, and that she herself, in the first year of her residence here, had been indebted to a neighbour for her milk and vege- tables. Talking of vegetables, led to the subject of "Billy,'? whom Mrs. Attridge laughingly averred to be a vegetable himself, for verdancy. Billy, she said, was a native of Holland, brought over to America in his infancy, and left a destitute orphan, whom her -^*. %  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7865-00000142"/> 800  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVEc. mother had taken and brought up, but whose peculi. arity of disposition and simplicity of character was such as fitted him only for house-work. She said that, on the death of his first mistress, Billy had attached himself to the fortunes of herself and husband, and had accompanied them to the West, and had been their only house servant ever since-cooking, cleaning, washing, and ironing, as well as any woman could. Rosahe was amused, cheered, and comforted, by Mrs. Attridge's lively conversation and kind sympathy -yet during the lady's visit, a case that had troubled the youthful wife for several days still weighed upon her spirits and cast its gloom over her countenance, and refused to be shaken off. Mrs. Attridge, with a housekeeper's sympathy and a woman's tact, divined the cause, and with rude but kind promptitude drew the trouble out to light, by suddenly asking- "What do you intend to do about your washing, my dear?-for it is all nonsense to suppose that you could wash." "It is, indeed," said Rosalie; "and that is just what disturbs me so. I can manage to keep our cabin tidy, and dress our little meals; but I cannot wash-indeed, I cannot. I attempted to do so, but, after having ex- hausted all my strength, and made myself almost ill, I failed. And when I know that every pioneer house. keeper needs to be competent to the performance of all her domestic duties, I feel thoroughly ashamed of my helplessness in some respects. And when I see my husband so patient and cheerful under domestic annoyances that no day-labourer with an efficient   helpmate ever has to suffer-oh! you know I must feel so cruelly disappointed in myself." Mrs. Attridge made no comment, but looked upon her young neighbour with a considerate, fond, pro- tective expression on her honest countenance. And after a few minutes; Rosalie spoke again- "Can you advise me what to do, Mrs. Attridge? for I have resolved that, in our present circumstances, my husband shall be put to no expense for these matters." "Oh I pshaw! you can never do it; and some other plan must be thought of," said the visitor, reflec- tively. "Yes, it is real incapacity on my part-a want of the requisite physical strength. I am not constitu- tionally weak; but the muscles of my arms and chest have never been trained to great or continued ex- ertion, and strengthened by that process-more is the pity Look at my wrists." And Rosalie, smilingly, tearfully, held out two delicate, fair, tapering arms. And Mrs. Attridge took and held them affectionately, while she said- "I know--I know it would be useless and cruel to expect hard work of you; and yet the expense oughtn't to come on him, neither, just now. I have been thinking, since I sat here, of an Irish family of the name of Malony, who live in a shanty about a quarter of a mile from this, on my road home. The man works at our furnace, and the woman washes for. bachelors. Now, although they are thriving, she and her family are always ragged, because she is as igno- rant as a savage of the use of a needle; and, besides, she says she hasn't time to sew. Now," said Mrs.  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7865-00000143"/> 302  LNDIA. THE PEARRL OF PIARL RIVER. Attridge, half laughingly, as she arose to depart, "suppose you were to barter work with Judy Ma- lony, and pay her for washing by making up clothing for her children? At any rate, I will call and see Judy on my way home, and send her over to Vo1.'" Rosalie cordially thanked her kind friend, and held her hand, and felt unwilling to allow her to depart. "I shall send Billy over with more fresh milk this evening. And you must not mind his grumbling- he grumbles at me and Mr. Attridge all day long sometimes, and won't allow. us to touch a thing in the garden till he thinks proper, without a deal of grumbling." Mrs. Attridge, after promising Rosalie to walk over and see her often, and spend whole days whenever it was possible, took leave, and de- parted. That evening Mark Sutherland returned home sooner than usual. His countenance was cheerful with good news, and he threw into Rosalie's lap a packet of letters and papers from home-the first that had been received since their separation from their friends. There was a letter from Colonel Ashey, full of kind wishes, and something more substantial in the shape of a cheque on the St. Louis bank, for his niece. He informed them that he was again alone-that his son, St. Gerald, having lost his election, had, under the disappointment, yielded to the wishes of his wife, and taken her to her Southern home; and that he expected his own eldest daughter,    DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS,    ^  8  now a widow, to return and take the direction of his household. There was also a letter from Valeria to Rose, and one from Lincoln to Mark. By these letters they learned that Mr. and Mrs. Lauderdale had joined the Asheys at Cashmere, and remained the guests of Clement Sutherland for a month before proceeding to their own home in Louisiana. Valeria wrote that the Valley of the Pearl was still the loveliest vale on earth, and Cashmere the brightest gem on its bosom; but that the envied master of this Eden was more sullen, morose, and unhappy than ever-that it was rumoured his affairs were not as prosperous as before-that he had engaged in ruinous speculations-that Mr. St. Gerald Ashey, since losing his election, had lost his good temper and amiability, and sought more consolation from his "generous wine" than from his unloving wife-that all these circum- stances weighed heavily upon the health and spirits of the beautiful India, who had changed sadly within : the last few months. The kind-hearted but volatile , Valeria touched lightly and reluctantly upon these  unhappy circumstances, and seemed always divided between her spirit of communicativeness and her ; scruples of conscience.  -   Mark Sutherland and Rosalie read with regret, and turned from the sad contemplation-with a sense of relief to rest gladly upon, the image of Valeria and Lincoln Lauiderdale, now happily settled upon their beautiful estate of Fairplains, in Louisiana. Withal this was a happy evening to the young cottagers-: a festival of gladness, such as can be fully enjoyed -' .",^-'-  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7865-00000144"/> 804  INDIA.

Tile next day Rosahe was somewhat surprised to receive a visit from Judy, and very well satisfied to effect with her an arrangement by which Judy was to do all the washing and ironing for Rosalie, who wa s to repay her by making up frocks and aprons for heIr children. And so, before the end of the first week of housekeeping, Rosalie's domestic circumstances were providentially arranged in all the order and comfort consistent with log-cabin life. It would seem a lonely life she led now, yet Rosalie found it not so. The solitude was peopled with hIer multitudinous rich affections, high purposes, anil bright hopes of the future. Through the day she sang at her active household work, or fell into pleasing reverie over her needle. In the afternoon, when Mark returned, they partook of an early supper, rested, a lld then took a pleasant woodland walk, or occupied t.'e evening hours with a book. On the first Sabbath Mrs. Attridge called in her car- ryall to offer the young couple the two vacant seats to church; a fayour which, after some little lhesitation and reflection, they frankly and gratefully accepted. And, afterwards, Mark Sutherland was much pleased when it fell in the way of his profession to do Mr. Attridge a gratuitous service--a favour which it was rather difficult to make honest Paul Attridge accept, who answered to all Mr. Sutherland's grateful acknow- ledgments and expostulations, "That neighbours should be neighbours, but that professional men should be paid for their services."' As passed the week, so passed the autumn, bringing   DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS.     305 little change in the circumstances of our young friends. Mr. Sutherland gained admittance to the bar;. but-as yet his professional duties were confined exclusively to office business, the drawing up of deeds, bonds, mort- gages, &amp;o. And this was not profitable  Indeed, many of his best-meaning neighbours strongly advised him to take up government land, and turn his attention to agriculture. But this Rosalie opposed with all her ] might, encouraging him to be constant to his profes- sion as he was to his wife-" for better for worse, for richer for poorer." She alone, suppressing all com- plaint and concealing allI her personal privations, con- : tinued to cheer and strengthen the struggler. She   : alone had an invincible faith in his future-his future of greatness and wide usefulness.  : Autumn waned, and the severe winter of those lati- i tudes approached. Early in December a heavy fall of  : snow covered the ground two or three feet in depth, rendering the road almost impassable between Wolf's Grove and Shelton, and nearly blockading our friends in their log cabin. It was with the greatest difficulty that Mark Sutherland performed the three miles' jour- ney from his home to his office, and Rosahe was a close prisoner in her house. The snow lay on the ground several weeks, during which time the hardships and privations of the young couple were so numerous and so great as to determine thbem to seize the earliest opportunity of removing into town; and Mark accordingly sought a house in Shelton. And having found one vacated by a family about to emigrate to Arkansas, he rented it at once, and availed himself of the first favourable change in the weather to remove to town and take possession of it. 19  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7865-00000145"/> 306  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. Their removal took place the first of January. A. return to the society of her fellow-beings produced a very happy change in the spirit of Rosalie. Patient, cheerful, and hopeful, she had been before; but now, the sight of people about her-all active, lively, ener. getic, each engaged in the pursuit of some calling, whose object was at once the benefit of his individual self and the community--this gave strong impetus to her enterprise, and suggested many plans of usefulness and improvement. Considerable and thriving as was the town of Shel- ton, no newspaper had as yet been published there. Rosalie spoke of this to her husband. Could he not create a sphere of influence and usefulness in that way? Could he not edit an independent newspaper? It took money to set up a journal, and he had no money, Mark answered. Could he not interest the small capitalists and busi- ness men of the village in this enterprise? Mark replied, that to edit a paper required time, and that his office business, though not enough to support them comfortably, was quite enough to spoil his leisure for any other employment. In fact, our friend was in a state of depression and discouragement, from which it required all the faith and hope that was in Rosalie to arouse him. She said that she would help him, both in the law office and with the paper. She begged him to try her-her "good will was to it," and she had more leisure than she could profitably employ at present. In brief, Rosalie effected her purpose. Mark Suth- erland prevailed upon the principal men of the village to unite in establishing a free paper; and, as a natural  i-a  *    *   CASIMERE.         807 result, they appointed Mr. Sutherland the editor. Rosalie rendered efficient though unseen aid. Nor did the enterprising spirit of the girl pause here. There was no good school in Shelton. The want of one was greatly felt. Rosalie proposed to Mark that she should open one. Mark at first opposed the plan-it would be too much for her. But Rosalie found her greatest health of mind and body in her greatest activity and usefulness. The girl's school was established by her single enterprise. And it grew and prospered. + A CHAPTER XXV.  CASHMERE.

FOUR years had passed away since Mark Sutherland and Rosahe had taken up their residence in the village of Shelton. In this space of time many changes had passed over the village community and--the individuals that composed it. The Territory had been erected  into a state-new  towns were incorporated-new cities founded-old ones throve. Shelton itself had more than doubled in population and importance.

A handsome court. house stood on the site of the old log tenement, whence the law, if not justice, had once issued its decisions; an excellent market-place, well attended, added much to the comfort of the citizens; a lyceum- an incipient library and museum, perhaps-lent its attractions to the town; an elegant and capacious hotel replaced the rude, clap-boarded tavern of Colonel Garner. The country around the village had become thickly settled, and many, many improve- ments, which it were tedious to enumerate, had added to the importance of the place. Our friends, Mark and Rosalie, had grown up with the village. Their paper, "Thze True Freeman," and their school, had both greatly prospered. But no one in the world, except Mark himself, knew how much of this prosperity was owing to the cheerful hope, the firm faith, the warm zeal, the untiring per- severance of Rosalie. And at times he wondered at the power of that pale, fragile creature-for she was still very delicate and frail. His professional business had increased very rapidly. He could not have specified any day, or afy suit, from which his success had taken its impetus-all had been so gradual, so purely the result of applica- tion and perseverance, rather than of accident or for- tune. He felt that here too there was an outward influence, an external power, to which he owed much, very much, of his persistent energy-a power living by his side, that continually threw itself with all its ardour and force into his purposes-into his soul- warming and strengthening him for effort, for endur- ance.    ' -. v--JLAo JLeO. -     UY His success was wonderful. He was already the most popular, the busiest, as he was also considered ". the most able lawyer in the West. Though but twenty-five years of age, he was no longer only by courtesy "Judge"-he was the presiding Judge of the court, by the appointment of the Executive. He had been elected to the State Senate; he had been named as a candidate for Governor. And he felt and knew that from the quiet, fair, and fragile being at his side, he drew continual strength, and light, and warmth; that, in addition to his own, he absorbed her life-her life, that she gave freely to her love. Her form was frailer, her face wanner, but more beautiful, more impressive than ever-for her eyes were brilliant and eloquent with enthusiasm, and her lips, "touched with fire." "Not' only for you-not only for you-but for humanity, dearest Mark, I wish you to attain power and place. You will attain them, and  Ishall not die till then/" she would mentally add.  At the end of the fourth year of their residence in  Shelton, Rosalie having attained her majority, it be- came necessary for Mark Sutherland to go to Missis- sippi-to Cashmere-on the part of his wife, for the purpose of making a final settlement with her guardian; Clement Sutherland, and taking. possession of her ' splendid fortune. He wished very much that Rosalie should accompany him to the South; but as "the necessity of her personal attendance might be dis- pensed with, and as at home the interests of their household, their school, and the paper, seemed to require the presence of one of them, it was decided * ':l  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7865-00000147"/> 810   INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. that Mark Sutherland should depart on his journey alone. It was on a cool, pleasant day of September that Judge Sutherland set out on his journey for the South. Rosahe had accompanied him on board the boat, to remain as long as she might before the steamer should leave the wharf. It was their first separation since their marriage, and upon that account alone, perhaps, they felt it the more sensibly; and as the boat was getting up her steam, Mark Sutherland blessed and dismissed his wife. He felt-how wan, how fragile, how spritual was her appearance; he almost felt that at any moment she might be wafted from his posses- sion, from his sight, for ever. The idea transfixed him with a sharp agony, but only for a little while. The boat was on her wa, and his thoughts turned from her he was leaving behind to those he was hastening to meet. This way, too, was full of anxiety. Nearly a year had passed since he had heard from any of his friends in Mississippi. Although he had written to his mother regularly; he had received no letter from her for several months, and the vague reports from Silentshades were not satisfactory. Six weeks had intervened since his wife had attained -her majority, and they had advised Mr. Clement Sutherland to be prepared to give an account of and yield up the property left in his care for so many years; yet no answer had been vouchsafed. Rumour also spoke of Clement Sutherland ,as a suspected, if not a ruined man. Full of anxiety as to the truth of these injurious rumours and the causes of this ominous silence, Mark Sutherland paced the deck of the steamer as it pur- sued its course down the river.  ,a                   w   CASHMERE.         811  ? It was on the afternoon of the sixth day of his voyage, that the boat stopped at the wharf of the small hamlet of C--, and Mark Sutherland debarked, and hired a horse to take him to Cashmere. He left his portmanteau in the care of the landlord of the little tavern, and set out on his ride. Leaving the low banks of the river to the westward behind him, lie rode on towards the interior of the State, ascended a line of hills, and descending the other side, entered once more the "Beautiful Valley of the Pearl." Here then he stood once more upon the scene of his youth's tragedy I With the profoundest interest he looked around. 'But all was, or seemed to be, changedl Had it really ever been so beautiful as it had qnce seemed  to him, and hadf age and decay passed over it? Or had its beauty been only the glamour thrown over the scene by youth, and love, and hope? It might : have been his changed and purified vision; for much of imagination, enthusiasm, ideality, had passed away  with the morning of Mark's life, even as the silvery i mist of sunrise passes away before the full, brod  day. It might have been the waning season, for it was  i now late in a dry and burning September; but the beauty and glory had departed from the vale. The luxuriant green freshness of summer had departed, and the brilliant and gorgeous magnificence of autumn had not come. All the vegetation-- forests, and shrub- : beries, and grasses--was dry and parched in the sun, and the very earth beneath seemed cawned by the dry :: and burning heat. The springs, ponds, and water--  courses were low, muddy, and nearly exhausted ; ':: over all the sun-burned, feverish earth, hung a  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7865-00000148"/> VU0  JusIa. lTHli PEARL OF PEARL RIVER..  coppery, parching sky. You scarcely could tell which  was driest and hottest-the burning sky above, or the burning earth below. It was, as an old field negro said, "like an oven-lid on an oven." The Pearl itself was now a narrow, shrunken, sluggish stream, creeping between high  banks of red and pulverized earth, that was always sliding in and discolouring and thickening the stream of water. Mark Sutherland rode down to the edge of the river, to the ferry house-once a neat and well-kept little building, now fallen into neglect and dilapidation. The white-haired negro ferryman was a servant of Clement Sutherland's, and an old acquaintance of Mark's. He met his "young master" with a sort of Subdued surprise and pleasure, and to his ouestion as ;o whether they were all well at Cashmere, answered with a sigh that they were just as well as usual. Mark asked no other questions  and in perfect filence the old man put his passenger over to the 3ashmere side. Here had once been a well-kept wharf, but now it vas much worn and out of repair. Under the shade of a group of elms on the right had once stood a )retty boat-house, in the form of a Chinese Pagoda; t was now a heap of ruins. There had once been a ittle fleet of boats moored under its shadow; there emained now one large, dirty skiff, half-full of mud nd water, and floating idly on the turbid stream; nd another smaller skiff, high and dry upon the beach, 7ith its, timbers shrunken apart, bleaching in the A. Mark rod   on through the grounds towards the a Mark rode on through the grounds towards the   house, he noticed further signs tapproaching desola- tion. Fences were broken or down, and out-build- ings were dilapidated or unroofed. Passing through the orchard, he saw the trees untrimmed; some broken d owrn with their loads of over-ripe fruit, some blighted -a prey to vermin--and some dying or dead, and wrapped in shrouds of cobwebs. Entering the vine- yard, he observed the trellis-work broken and falling, the vines trailing on the ground, and the ripe and luscious fruit rotting on its stems. He paused near the garden on his right, and a glance showed him that favourite resort of his youth, once the perfection of order and beauty, now a wilderness where thousands of the most lovely flowers and most noxious weeds dried and decayed together under-the burning sun of September. There the deadly nightshade grew ranker than the rose which it crowded out of life; and , the poison oak, whose contact is death, twined in and out among the tendrils of the honeysuckle and the  clematis. -  EverywhereI everywhere I all things betokened in- difference and neglect, and prophesied of ruin :and despair. While occupied with wondering what could have been the cause of this great and grievous change, Mark Sutherland perceived the approach of an old -  negro, who touched his hat in respectful salutation, and followed him to the foot of the Rose Terrace, where he stood in readiness to take the horse. Mark dismounted, and threw the reins to the groom, whom   ] he now recognized for an old acquaintance. He held  out his hand and .spoke kindly to the old man, in-  ] quiring after his wife and children.

With 3 deep sigh, Mark Sutherland turned from the poor old man, and went up the stone steps that led to the Rose Terrace, that was also a neglected wilderness-but a wilderness of roses, and therefore still beautiful. Unannounced, he went up into the piazza; and before he could retreat, in an instant hb saw and heard the following:-A man-or perhaps I should be expected to say, a gentleman-of very bloated and slothful appearance, was lazily reclining upon a bench, with his feet on the top of the balus- trades, and with his right arm around the waist of a pretty, frightened quadroon girl, who seemed from the fan she still held, to have been engaged in keeping the flies off from him while he slept. She was now gently and fearfully struggling to free herself from his clasp, and saying, in hushed, frightened tones-   CASHMERE. -        15 : "O1 if you please, sir, don'tl Consider. Indeed it isn't right. What would my dear mistress say?" "Mistress! rIy pretty Oriole! I wish she may say anything! Let her! You shall kiss me " O master! O sir!" At this moment Mark Sutherland had entered, ad- vanced, and bowed very coldly, saying-"Mr. St. Gerald Ashey, if I remember right?"       * The ruin of St. Gerald Ashey arose to his feet, and answered, with something of his former ease and self- possession, "Yes, sir. Mr. Sutherland, you are welcome to Cashmere again. Walk in; or would you prefer to sit down in the cool air here for a few moments? The I house is very warm. Girl, go and let you mistress know that Mr. Sutherland has arrived."       - He added this command in a tone of authority, in : strong contrast of his tone of wooing of a, moment gince. Oriole, with her eyes filled with tears, and her face dyed with blushes, went gladly to obey. Mr. Ashey then conducted his guest into the house. In a few minutes Oriole returned. Her mistress was too indisposed to appear; Mr. Sutherland would please to excuse her.           '   I Within half an hour a servant, summoned for the purpose, showed Mr. Sutherland to his room, and sup- plied him with articles necessary to the bath: and toilet. After refreshing himself, Mark rang the bell, and requested to know if Mr. Clement Sutherland was in the house, and when he could see him. He was answered, that Mr. Sutherland had- ridden  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7865-00000150"/> 316  INDIA.

No one was present at the board beside Mr. Ashey and Mark Sutherland, except Oriole, who stood at the head of the table, and poured out the coffee. With profound and melancholy interest Mark Sutherland watched this girl. She had been a pretty child, and now had ripened into a most beautiful woman. A slight and elegant form, well rounded and tapering, pliant and graceful as a willow, oval face of the purest olive, warming into pomegranate bloom upon the cheeks and lips; large, dark-grey, passionate eyes, fringed with long black lashes, "sweet low brow," shaded with soft, black, silky ringlets, a coun- tenance full of slumbrous passion and emotion, with little strength of spirit or of intellect. These formed the complete and matchless beauty of the maiden, and Mark Sutherland noticed-he could not help but no. tice, his interest was so painfully excited-the glances with which Mr. Ashey followed the gracefully-moving form of Oriole. Mark Sutherland wished to inquire after the health and welfare of his -mother, with whom he had made oseveral attempts to open a correspondence, but from whorn he had not heard for nearly four years; but an undefinable reluctance withheld him from naming the subject to the degenerate man before him. Mr. Ash- ley ordered more wine, and pressed it upon his com- panion; but Mark Sutherland, habitually abstemious, suffered his glass to be filled once, and then excused himself; and Mr. Ashey filled and quaffed glass after glass, momentarily more and more garrulous, noisy,   CASHMERE.        f81. and familiar with Oriole-calling her to his side,. drawing her towards him, pinching her cheek- and pulling her ears with maudlin freedom; while the poor girl, blushing with shame and confusion, and weeping with grief and terror, sought in vain to escape. Mark Sutherland, deeply offended with the scene, would gladly have withdrawn, but that he felt his presence to be some protection to the poor girl; he would gladly have interfered for her succour, but that he knew such interference, far from saving her, would hurry on her destruction. It is hard to be wise and prudent when the blood is boiling; and it is uncer- - tain how long he would have remained so, had not a   bell sounded in a distant part of the house, and Oriole, taking advantage \of the circumstance, ex- ! claimed, "It is my mistress," and made her escape. Mr. Ashey poured out and quaffed glass after glass of wine, until his ranting mood was merging into a stupid one; and Mark Sutherland seized 'the first op- portunity to rise and leave the table, and pass into the drawing-room. That elegant drawing-room which you may recol- lect communicated with Miss Sutherland's beautiful boudoir-'how changed since he saw it last! Desola-: tion was creeping even into the sanctuary of the house. He had scarcely time to note this by the sickly light of the moon through the open shutters, when a loud, familiar voice in the hall arrested his attention-     - "Where is he?  In the drawing-room? And no light there? Get a candle, directly, you scoundrel! and 'light me in there Il I shall break my shins  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7865-00000151"/> 818  INDIA.

And soon after entered a slovenly man-servant bringing a guttering tallow candle, stuck in a mil. dewed silver candlestick, which he sat upon a dusty and spotted marble pier-table. He was followed closely by Mr. Billy Bolling, who, with outstretched arms, and almost shouting his welcome, ran to Mark abd clasped him around the body, exclaiming, sob- bingly- X "My dear-dear-bo-oy I!

How are they all at Silentshades? How is my dear mother?" "Silentshades'! lMother! Heigh I didn't you know they had sold Silentshades long ago, and moved to Texas?" exclaimed Uncle Billy, with a look of un-  bounded astonishment.  "I knew nothing about it. This is the first word I have heard of it! What on earths could have tempted my mother to sell her home and move away "from all her friends?" "What could have tempted her?-what could have tempted her?" repeated Uncle Billy, mockingly, shut- ting his eyes, pinching his lips, and bobbing up his nose and chin, with petulance and- contempt. "What could have tempted her to marry Doctor WT]ells, at her age?--a woman of forty, whose matrimonial feelings should all be quiet? What could have tempted her to do that?"'  "I suppose my mother was lonesome." "Oh I -lonesome be hanged I Wasn't I there-her natural born brother-to keep her company?

"Well, I was there to take care of her, and protect her, and keep her company, and cowhide her niggers -although that last is very laborious exertion, and always put me in a profuse perspiration, and gives me a palpitation of the heart-the thoughtless creatures, to put me to the trouble of fatiguing myself so. And now, if you want to know what tempted your mother to sell her home and leave all her friends, I'll just tell you-vanity." "Vanity!" "Yes, vanity-the wish to be thought generous, and disinterested, and confiding," sneered Uncle Billy. Mark Sutherland reddened. "My dearest mother was all that in reality, without wishing to be thought so!" -"I tell you 'twas vanity--vanity that tempted her to sell her home-vanity that tempted her to marry- vanity that tempted her first to listen to a suitor-a woman of her age  But I do think women are the most incorrigible-the most provoking--the most hopeless-and of all women, middle-aged widows are the most desperate fools P" "Uncle Billy, I suppose, as an old bachelor, you have a license to rail at women in general, and, as an elder brother, you have liberty to be unjust to your sister. My mother was a handsome woman, in her prime, and it appears to me not unnatural that she should have married. But if you thought otherwise, you should have told her so." "For what good?

"And how do you know it was not perfectly sin. cere?" exclaimed Mark, indignantly rising and walk. ing away. "What, at forty?" coolly inquired Uncle Billy, getting up and walking about, and fanning himself, and sitting down again. But Mr. Sutherland was much too deeply interested in his mqther's fate to keep silence. He returned, and resumed his seat, and inquired- "Has m' mother's marriage turned out happy?" "Don't know-can't say, I'm sure!" "You have not told me yet why she sold her home." "Dr. Wells tempted her to do it for his s:ke. This was the way of it: Lord bless your soul, he was too old and cunning to stop courting her after the honey. moon, or at'least until he had got his hands on the property; on the contrary, they sat on the bench of the piazza against the parlour window blinds, and courted more than ever I And I laid on the lounge under thu same window in the parlour, and listened more than ever nd then he cooed to her, and called her 'My boon,' 'M blessing,' and ' My bride;' and told her what a noble woman she was-howl full of sensibility, benevolence, and disinterestedness-how full of honour, truth, and courage."

By-and-by he began to take the tone of a wise, affectionate guide and husband-which I have always noticed ism very charming to good women, especially when it is mixed up with a little apprecia- tive admiration-and he told her again what a high- principled, noble woman she was, and how she had only to get rid of one foible-one little weakness-and she would be a glorious woman-a perfect woman  And she pressed to know what it was, and she was willing to get rid of any fault he disapproved. 'Oh,' he told her, 'it was a want of trustfulness-a: want of that confiding spirit so beautiful An woman-it was no fault; only but for that one small foible she would be such a glorious woman!' Well, Mark, to convince him that she could exercise a confiding spirit, and so become 'a glorious woman' all out, she gives him the full possession and perfect control of all her property, real and personal; and the upshot of it all is, that Dr. Wells has sold Silentshades, and they have emigrated to Texas!" "Was my mother willing to go?" "I don't know, Mark. After parting with Silent- shades, they remained here at Cashmere about three months before getting off to Texas; and I thought in that three months your mother altered more than any one I had ever seen." "Poor, dear mother!"I "There was another thing that gave her trouble. The Doctor certainly did neglect her; and then he took a great fancy to purchase a beautiful maid-ser. '         C ' .

"Yes, I know"- "Mrs. Ashey-India-wished to part with her, too; and I dare say the sale would have been effected, only there was an execution, and Oriole, with half a dozen of the likeliest of the house servants, both men and maids, were seized, and put up at auction. Well, when Oriole was placed upon the block, there was pretty high bidding, I assure you. The three princi- pal bidders were a New Orleans trader-who seemed determined to have the girl at any price-and Dr. Wells, and Mr. Ashey. But Dr. Wells and Mr Ashey outhid the trader, and had the field all to themselves; and the contest ran very high between them. I wish you could have seen those two men bidding against each other for that girl! They became excited- angry-their eyes grew blood-shot-they glanced at each other like tigers-their glances flashed firel They ran the price up to a ridiculous pitch. Finally, Dr. Wells, frowning, sat down. Mr. Ashey was the purchaser. 'Thank Heaven,' said your mother, when she heard the issue. Mrs. Ashey curled her lip in proud silence!" Mark Sutherland dropped his head upon his hands, and groaned. A pause ensued, which after some time was broken by Mr. Sutherland. "You mentioned an execution on the premises-is it possible my uncle was in debt beyond his means of cash payment?" "Umph I I don't think any one in the State would consider it worth while to ask the question now."   "I do not understand how his colossal fortune could have so sunken." "Ah, well! now I'll tell you his fortune was not so colossal after all. To be sure, he owned several thousand acres of land; but reflect that nine-tenths of that was pine barrens and cypress swamps, producing nothing and costing considerable in taxes; and he owned several hundred negroes; but remember that one-third of them were old people, and one-third of them children, who had to be supported out of the labour of the others; and he owned this very magni- ficent seat of Cashmere; but consider how much of his capital was invested in the building, laying out and adorning of this house and grounds, and how much in debt it left him, and you will come to a fairer con- clusion in your estimate of your uncle's fortune. And then this great commercial crash, that has ruined so many people, has affected him deeply. He lost one hun-  dred thousand dollars by the villany of Claxton &amp; Co., manufacturers, and nearly as much more by the failure of Fleece and Brother, importers, Liverpool. And what was worse than all, he made a desperate attempt to retrieve his fortunes by speculation, and failed, with a stupendous loss. It was like a gambler's last stake, and he lost it-and now he is ready to blow his own brains out I Lord grant that your wife's fortune may be safe, Mark, which I doubt." "Oh certainly; I have not the-slightest misgiving of it. It was real estate, and could not have been staked in any way, you know." Mr. Bolling shook his head. Unfleedful of that wise gesture, Mr. Sutherland asked, "And how does my cousin India bear this?"  i:1  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7865-00000155"/> 826  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER.

She never cared a sous, cent, marquee, for-tim, though he loved the very ground she walked on.

"How changed since last her speaking eye Glanced gladness round the glittering room, Where high-born men were proud to wait- Where beauty watched to imitate Her gentle voice and lovely mien- And gather from her air and gate The graces of its queen!"--Byron. EARLY  the  next morning Mark Sutherland de. scended to the  drawing-room. No one was there except Oriole, who had just stepped from her mis- tress's boudoir, and was crossing the room, on her way to some other part of the house. Once more Mark Sutherland was mournfully affected by the mar- vellous, the fatal beauty of the poor girl. As she met and was passing him, with eyes cast down, cheeks painfully flushed, and heart beating, as it had too well learned to beat with fear at the lool of man, his heart   INUDIA.         OW was moved with deep pity. He had known her from her infancy; he held out his hand, and spoke to her, saying-"How do you do, Oriole? You have not spoken to me since my arrival." But without touch- ing his hand, or even venturing a glance at his face, the maiden dropped a quick courtesy as she passed, and hurried on her errand. "Poor, hunted, trembling deer!" said Mark: " she cannot even trust a friend. Is it possible to save her?" His thoughts dwelt with painful but vain intensity upon the hapless girl, anld it was many minutes before the old familiar scene around him-suggestive as it was of the most joyous as well as the most painful passages in his past life-could recall him to him- self. He gazed around.  The sliding doors and the  flowing curtains that divided the boudoir from the salooln, were drawn entirely back, revealing the whole. apartment. Yes; here was the same saloon,'the temple i of joyous reunions, and the same boudoir, the shrine of beauty, love, and happiness. The same, yet how changed from all the pristine splendour of the pastJ Then all was order, beauty, freshness, and enjoyment. Now all was indifference, neglect, decay, and desola- tion. Even there, in the sacred bQudoir of India-the latest sanctuary of elegance- and luxury-rust and must, mildew and canker, had crep:6 over all. There the sumptuous hangings of purple and gold, that made the bower seem like some gorgeous oriental sunset scene, were now faded and tarnished-the royal purple turned to a dull, streaked brown and drab-the gold cankered with green verdigris. The cheval mirrors  e             -;  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7865-00000157"/> were specked thickly with mildew, and obscured with fly-stains; the marble tables stained and smirched; and, for the fragrance of fresh flowers, a close, d(amp, stifling smell of must pervaded the apartment. All was cheerless, hopeless, desolate. His melancholy thoughts were interrupted by the entrance of another figure. It was India. And pre.  pared as he had been to meet a great change in the "Pearl of Pearl River," he scarcely recognised her. The superficial is ever the first to strike us. He noticed that the gorgeous and flowing drapery which  had once graced her form, was now replaced by a plain black dress. The rich, warm, olive bloom of her complexion had given place to the paleness of ivory. Naught remained of her glorious beauty but the luxuriaft amber-hued ringlets and the large, dark, mournful, soul-thrilling eyes. More of real self-pos- session she exhibited now than she had ever shown in former times. She advanced towards Mark, holding out her hand, and welcomed him with these words: "I am  happy to see you again at Cashmere-after so many years-my dear cousin--why could we not be friends?" Her voice faltered slightly; and when she paused, Mr. Sutherland  cordially grasped her outstretched hands, and said, while he pressed them-- "i We  are friends, my dearest India; at least, I can speak for myself and for one who loves you not less than I do-my wife Rosalie," With a spasmodic catch India snatched away her hands; and, quivering through every nerve, sat down, anI veiled her face with her hands, and,   "It is a trying world!"-burst from her quivering lips.                  . Raising his eyebrows in painful surprise, Mark Sutherland gazed earnestly at her for an instant, and then turned away his eyes, waiting reverently for her self-recovery. Soon she looked up, and, faintly smiling, said-- "I have had much, oh I very much, indeed, to try me of late, my cousin. Everything is going to ruin with us-everything, everything." "I trust not. Your father is embarrassed, but with the advice and assistance of his friends, all, I hope, will be brought to a happy issue." "Ah, no I but it is not of our desperate affairs I wished to speak. Tell me of your own. You have- been successful in life?" "Yes, I have been successful, thanks, under Divine Providence, to the constant sympathy and co-operation - of my faithful Rosalie." Again India hastily raised'her hands, to screen the spasm of pain that traversed her countenance; and- "Why will he stab me with that name?" she thought; but she answered calmly-"Rosalie is an amiable woman; how is she?"        -: "Well, and very busy." "And your family?" "We have no family; we are all the world to each other."  "Tell me how you have got on since I saw you last."  Mr. Sutherlandc began, and. told her the principal i  circumstances of his life since their last. parting-- 1i v;   *       .   &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7865-00000158"/> 332  INDIA.

( "And so Rosalie hab n the angel of his life," she muttered inaudibly between her white lips, A pause ensued, which was broken at last by India. "All is sadly changed here; my father has been very unfortunate, and Mr. Ashey I cannot corn. prehend it! I see ruin gathering darkly around us all, without the power-yes, and without the will-to avert it, any more than I could avert an earthquake, whose premonitory jars were shaking us. Ue said, in a despairing tone. Mark Sutherland made no comment. What could he have said to console her that would not have been false? He thought that not so would Rosalie have met misfortune-with inert despair. And then he remembered that much of this impending ruin the beautiful India had drawn upon her own head, and the heads of those who loved her, but whom, alas! she loved not. He felt relieved when, at this point, a summons to the breakfast-room terminated the inter- view. At the breakfast-table appeared India, Mark Suther- land, St. Gerald- Ashey, and Mr. Bolling. Oriole served tea and coffee from a side-table. Clement Sutherland had not come home. Mr. Ashey's face was bloated, and his eyes blood-shot-the effects of the preceding eveningls excess were but too plain. He sat silent and morose, and ate but little. India maintained a cold, severe aspect, never speaking to or looking at - him.  Mark Sutherland felt himself de trop and uncom- fortable, but for Uncle Billy, who kept up an inces. sant monologue, asking a score of questions about the "w':*   INDIA.    f     8s . north-west, and volunteering many comments. Mr.  Sutherland was rejoiced when the gloomy meal was over, and earnestly wished that the master of the house might soon return, and his business and his  visit be concluded at once. He expressed 'this:wish to Mr. Bolling, who hastened to reply- "A nd so do I, nephew! and so do IIt For this is -the case every day. Each night that fellow goes to bed tipsy, and each morning appears at the breakfast table in a state of bloated torpor! Yes, Lord knows tgo I wish that Clem.

The day advanced, and still Clemrhent Sutherland did not make his appearapce. The late dinner was served, and passed as gloomily as the breakfast, and still he came not. The house was growing intoler- able to Mark, who summoned one of the servants, - . and inquired where he should be likely to find his master; and was informed that he might be found at the Planters' Rest, where he usually stopped when  . business took him to the village. Mr. Sutherland then ordered his horse, and, while waiting for him to be saddled and brought to the door, went and took leave of Mr. Bolling, leaving his compliments and adieus to Mrs. Ashey, who had retired to he. room to take her 1 afternoon rest. Then he mounted his horse, and:  took the road to the village, intending, if possible, to ha've an interview and a settlement with his uncle, and to make his head-quarters at the village inn, as r long as he should be obliged to remain. . . *    ,           . - :"  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7865-00000159"/> 884   INDIA.

And now he sat, with his prematurely whitened head bowed upon his cramped and shrivelled hands, bitterly trying to recall the wiles and review the crooked paths by which the fiend had led him. In youth, his besetting sin had been a reasonable wish of independence, and he called it thrift; and it seemed to justify every kind of parsimony and selfish- ness. In maturity it became a craving desire for wealth, and he named it prudent foresight, wise pro- vision for the future, and it appeared to excuse every sort of exaction from health, life, and limb, of his labourers, or " uttermost farthing" from his debtors. In midlife it grew an absorbing passion, and he termed it parental devotion, and it seemed to palliate every species of injustice, cruelty, and dishonesty.

But how to raise this su ? He had neither cash nor credit; and all his estate in which he had retained more than a life interest, was mortgaged to nearly its full value. There was one means of raising the funds suggested to his mind, but his soul shrank from it. He could anticipate his ward's majority by a few months, and borrow her signature only for a power of attorney and a deed of moYtgage-that was all. And the money could be raised on her real estate, and the sum in- vested, and the profits secured. And then the mort- gage could be released and destroyed before the (he hesitated to give the act its proper name, even in his thought) forgery could be discovered and exposed. So the tempter persuaded him. He had never trained his moral strength by re- sisting slight temptations; and now that the tempta- tion was very great, he fell before it. Scarcely daring to think on what he was about to do, he left the neighbourhood of Cashmere for two weeks, and on his return, laid before his correspondent, the usurer at C   , a power of attorney and a deed of mort- gage, seemingly duly signed, witnessed and attested. Upon these the requisite funds were borrowed, em- barked in the speculation, and lost!

Clement Sutherland started to his feet, pale and wild-looking, and gazed, without speaking, at his nephew. "' Sir, you are ill " exclaimed the latter, anxiously, stepping up to him. Muttering some inaudible words between his white lips, the old man sunk down, collapsed, into his chair. Mark hastily stepped to the bell-rope, to ring for wine. But the guilty man, in the confusion of his trouble, misunderstood the intention, and stretching out his trembling, almost palsied arm, bade him "Stop, for Christ's sake!" ' Mark returned; with looks of interest. "I did not mean to-to wrong her Il God knows 1 did not!" said the old man, in a quivering tone. "Wrong whom?" added Mark, regarding him with much surprise and anxiety; "sir, sir, you are really ill, and I must summon some assistance." "No, no! you are mistaken. Bring no witnesses. It is-it is-a family affair. Now, I suppose, you will have your revenge l" exclaimed Clement Sutherland, with a frightened, chattering smile. Without more ado, Mark hastened to the door, with the purpose of sending for a physician. But the old man sprang, tottered after him, and clasped him around, staggered back, exclaiming-"You shall not! I'll have no witnesses. Oh! you're a lawyer!"

But now he bursts forth in a fit of fury, as ungovernable as it was unrea- sonable and impotent. Mark Sutherland stood quietly by, and let his rage exhaust itself. Then, when the guilty man was calm from prostration, his nephew spoke to him coolly, wisely, kindly-making him un- derstand and feel that his detection was inevitable, un- less he put him in possession of all the facts, to prepare him to meet knowingly the exigencies of the case.

"And now, what do you purpose to do?" was his trembling question, when he had confessed all. "I shall return home to-morrow, and take counsel with Rosalie." "Take counsel with her" exclaimed the old man, in alarm. "Be at ease, sir. She has a voice in this matter. Nay, she has-it must be-it is her name that has been used-her property that is lost. And if it were not-if it were my own exclusive affair, still I should consult her before taking any important step!" "What will become of us?-of India? My child l my child! that your high head should be bowed  with shame 1" cried the wretched man, in a voice of anguish. "Reassure yourself, sir, I beg. I can answer for Rosalie's noble heart. You are safe from all punish- ment from her. And now let us part at once. You had better return to Cashmere, where your family '  must be anxiously awaiting you." "And where will you stay?" "To-night I shall go on board the steamer Vic- tress, which will leave for the Upper Mississippi to- morrow."  Suddenly the old man lifted up his head, and showed a countenance brightened with hope. Mr. Sutherland  stopped to hear what he had to say. He grasped the arm of his nephew, exclaiming-  "Ohl Mark, I have it now. -I hae found the means by which family honour and Rosalies fortune !           ? - I *     ..          ;^:  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7865-00000162"/> 40   INDIA.

But the signature was written before she came of age; therefore the deeds are null and void and the usurer cannot foreclose the mortgage, or recover his morey. So you see that I can--I mean family honour- can be saved, and Rosalie lose nothing either." An involuntary expression. of scorn and loathing flashed from Mark Sutherland's fine Roman face for a moment.; and then, composing himself, he replied, coolly- "No, sir; if you are saved, it must be at our own proper cost and loss." And so they part'ed. CHAPTER   XXYIII. UNCLE BILLY. "He's had misfortunes, great and sma', But aye a soul above them far; He'll be a credit to us a', We'll a' be proud o' Willie!"-Burns.

The orgies of a noisy party of card- players in the saloon below occasionally broke upon his silence; and the sweet laughter of young girls, walking on the guards of the ladies' cabin, was borne upwards on the wind. But the hurricane deck was lonely, and there he paced up and down, wrapped in mournful thought, until the arrival of a noisy set, who, weary of the heated saloon, sought the free, fresh ail above, and disturbed his solitude. Then he went below, and sought his berth. Early in the morning he arose from a sleepless couch, to 'find all the officers and hands on the boat engaged in receiving last freight and passengers, while the engine was getting up her steam to be off. Mark Sutherland finished his morning toilet, and went out upon the guards, just as the boat was beginning to move from the wharf. The usual crowd of idlers,: porters, and loafers, stood upon the shore, watching her departure. And Mark Sutherland fixed himself in a favourable position for watching the receding wharf .of what might be ,called his native village, when the figure of a fat man, in white linen jacket and trousers, with his light hair blowing free behind his rosy face, waving a straw hat, came running des- perately towards the wharf. The boat arrested her motions, the plank was thrown-out, and Uncle Billy Ifollowed by a man with his trunk and portmanteau, stepped on board. Panting and blowing, and wiping his face, he hastened up to Mr. Sutherland, exclaim- ing, "My dear boy  I liked to have missed youl Near as possible I Wouldn't have lost you for, the world, my dearest lad I Stick to you as long as I live, Mark, for your dear mother, my sister's sake I Whewl   &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7865-00000163"/> 342.

And so, talking and shaking his nephew's hand, and wiping his own rosy face, and blowing and panting, Mr. Bolling at last sat down, and began to fan him- self with his broad-brimmed straw hat. Mark Sutherland received his relatives demonstra- tions of attachment as best he might; he welcomned him, and went to the captain's office to see if he could secure a state-room' for his enforced travelling - com- pani on; and by the time he had successfully accom- plished his errand, the passengers, were summoned to the breakfast-table, and the boat had cleared the wharf and was well under way up the Missis- sippi. It was a slow voyage up trjiver, and on the after- noon of the twelfth day the steamer arrived at the wharf of Shelton. Mark Sutherland wished, if pos. sible, to get rid of his troublesome travelling com- panion for a few hours, while he could go home quietly, and have an uninterrupted meeting and talk with his dear Rosalie. So, leaving all' their baggage in the care of the  clerk of the boat, Mark drew Uncle Billy's fat arm within his own, and conducted him to Col. Gar- ner's hotekto a private parlour, containing a com- fortable. lounge and easy chair. Here he ordered a lunchton of cold ham, fowl, sardines, -pickled oysters, and next all the late newspapers the house could muster; and having seen them all arranged upon the table, to which the easy chair was drawn up, and while Uncle Billy stretched his lazy lenth   UNCLE BILLY.        843 upon the lounge, Mr. Sutherland turned to Mr. Bol- ling, and said- "And now, Uncle Billy, can you excuse me, and make yourself comfortable, while I run down to Rosalie and prepare her for your arrival?" "Eh? Yes; all rightl Certainlyl The child always was fond of me, and it might give her too much of a shock to meet me suddenly, after so long a separa- tion! Very considerate of you, Mark, certainly- very!" "Is there anything else I can order for you before Igo?" "Eh? No, nothing; I am much obliged to you, nephew." "Well, if you should think of anything after I am gone, you can ring for it, you know."t "Yes--yes." "Good afternoon for the present, I will come and fetch you at tea-time."  "Yes; very well, I shall be ready. Hark ye, Mark break my arrival to your wife cautiously, do you hear? Joy kills sometimes." "I shall be careful not to endanger Rosalie's life," said Mark, smiling as he left the room. No sooner had the door closed behind his nephew, than, with a sigh of profound satisfaction, Uncle 13illy arose and sat down in the easy choar, and drew the table towards him. In addition to ever  :ing else on the table, there was a tall, black bottler ich Mr. Bolling took up, uncorked, and put to his -nose with a look of delightful anticipation. He sat it down suddenly, with an expression of intense dis- gust--  &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7865-00000164"/> 830   IN-DIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER.

The man withdrew, and after a while returned with a black bottle of the villanous drugged compound which is sold and bought as the best port wine, and which bon vivants like Mr. Bolling imbibe with perfect faith.

Bryant, ON the outskirts of the town, embosomed in a grove of trees, stood Rose Cottage, the pleasant homq of the Sutherlands. It was named partly from'Rosalief and partly from her favourite flower-the rose-of which every variety had been collected and cultivated to adorn her house and garden. The house itself was   FAILING HfALTH.       845    I Firple .and plain in its structure-just an oblong two- Etry frame building, painted white, with green Venetian blinds, and having four rooms on each floor, with a wide passage running through the centre from front to back, and with an upper and lower piazza running all around the house. T'be grounds were unpretending, to--behind the house a kitchen-garden and: young ochard; in front and at the sides a spacious yard, where single great forest trees were left standing, with rural seats fixed under their shade. In that rich and fertile soil the favourite rose flourished luxuriantly. Rose-trees adorned the yard, rose-bushes hedged the parterres, rose-vines shaded the arbours and climbed the pillars of the piazza and gracefully festooned the eaves; and the fragrance of roses filled the air. What gave a tenderer interest to these beautiful roses was, th they were all love-offerings from- the young girls and chil- * dren to their beautiful and beloved teacher. Mark Sutherland approached this Sweet home. Every care and sorrow dropped from his spirit as he opened the little wicket-gate that separated his garden of Ederrfrom the wilderness. He walked on through the shaded yard to the house, and went up to the piazza, and through the' front door into the hall, or passage. Here" two doors, opposite each other to the right and left, opened-one into their parlour and dining-room, and the other into thi school and class- room. He paused a moment, and listened, with a smile, as the low murmur of girls' voices revealed to himn that the school was not yet dismissed. l e opened the door and entered. , Surely, there never was a school-room so pleasant  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7865-00000165"/> 346  enDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVElR. as this, from which the aspect of dullness, weariness, restraint, and irksomeness, was so completely banished, as there certainly never was a teacher so lovely and so beloved. It was a spacious, airy apartment, lighted with many windows, shaded at a little distance by the rose-wreathed pillars and eaves of the piazza. The furniture was of bright cherry, in cheerful contrast to the white walls and floor. Maps and pictures, of rare beauty and appropriateness, decorated the walls, and shells and minerals and mosses adorned the tables. The young girls and children-some engaged in study, some in pencil-drawing or penmanship, and some in needlework--looked cheery and very much at their ease. They left their seats, and spoke to each other without infringing any rule, but all was done quietly and gracefully, as under the influence of a beloved mistress, whom they obeyed with no forced eye-service, and whom they would not for the world distress or annov. And there, at the upper end of the room, on a plat- form  raised but one step above the floor, on a chair, at a table, sat the young schoolmistress-the wife of four years' standing-scarcely turned twenty-one, and with the loveliest and most delicate face and form in the world, yet by the power of her soul's strength and beauty keeping in willing subjection a miscellaneous crowd of girls, of all ages, sizes, and tempers. There she sat, with her sweet, fair face, and pale, golden. curly hair, and white muslin wrapper--looking the fairest girl among them all. When Mark entered, the quiets light of joy dawned in her eyes, and she arose and came  softly down to meet him. There was a -^   FATTING HFALTH.        7 '  , subdued gladness in the manner of both, as they clasped hands. (My dearest Rose, you are so much better than when- I went away," said Mark, looking fondly at her, as the bloom deepened on her cheeks. "I am better-I am well,' replied Rosalie, smiling round upon her girls, several of whom left their seats, and came fluttering forward to welcome Mr. Suther- land with saucy pleasure. He had a merry jest or a loving word for each affectionate child, but soon sent them gaily back to their places, as the hour of dis- missal had come. And Rosalie, accompanied by Mark, went back to her seat, and called the school to order, and gave out and led the evening hymn that closed their exercises. When the song was finished, and the girls all gone, Mark Sutherland turned to his young wife, and with a smile of joy drew her to his bosom. But in a mo- ment a shade of anxiety clouded his face; and, still clasping her close to his bosom, he asked--  "Rose, what makes your hear) throb so vio- lently?" Rosalie raised her eyes to his face, and he noticed that a sorrowful shade dimmed their lustre for an instant, but vanished before the smile with which she replied-          ..  "I am so glad to see you." "But your heart knocks so fordcibly?" "Come in the parlour, and let's sit down there and. talk-I have so many things to tell you, and to sk you about," sald- Rosalie, evading his remarks; and gently withdrawing herself, she led the way into the - i -: - '. ,  -l  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7865-00000166"/> parlour, and wheeled up an easy chair, -and begged * him to "' sit down and make himself at home;." Out, first, he made her recline upon the lounge and rest, while he drew the chair up and sat by her side. 'And there she lay, with her sweet, spiritual face, white as her drapery, except where all the colour had concentrated in a circumscribed fiery spot in either  :cheek. She was breathing short, yet smiling gaily at her own difficulty.  He sat watching her, and trying to feel and to look happy, yet thinking that after all she was not so well as when he had left her-perceiving that he had mis-. taken fever heat for healthful bloom. He sat, trying to smile and talk cheerfully, yet with a dull, aching  prophecy in his heart. It was in vain to stifle the rising anxiety. It found some vent in these words: "My love, you work too hard; that school is hurt- ig your health?" "No, dear Mark, believe me, it is not-it keeps me up."                       "It exhausts, it prostrates you, my love-indeed, it must be closed-that school must be closed!" By way of nimbly proving how strong she was, she arose to a sitting posture, arranged her hair by run- ning her slender fingers through the ringlets, ad- justed her dress, and sat straight up, while she answered- "Not for the world would I  close that school, dear Mark. I   have no children, and that school is my field of almost unbounded usefulness. Those girls are my children; and not only must I cultivate their intellects, but in every young, receptive heart I must   sow good seed, that will bring forth fruit long after I* am in" She paused suddenly, in embarrassment. "What do you mean, Rosalie?" he asked, in dis--. tress. "Dearest Mark," she said, slightly evading a direct reply, " dearest Mark, a faithful teacher, called to-the work, may not abandon hei post, indeed; for oh! see- how mighty the influence of a teacher may be, and: hdw long it may last-the good principles instilled! into a little girl's tender heart do not conclude: their' work with her alone, but influence -her children; and her children's children, and all who come within her sphere and in theirs.

He raised his head, and looked at her sweet, wan face. He could not, for his life, tell anything  to distress her then; so he answered that Mr. Clemeiint Sutherland was not yet prepared to  give an account . of his trust, but that all would be arranged before the close of the month.; Rosalie arose, .nd putting her hands upon his- shoulders, pressed a, kiss upon his forehead, and waif: gliding away.

Suddenly Mr. Sutherland remembered Uncle Billy. "Stop, Rosalie," he said, "I have got something to" tell you." - And Rosalie sat down again; and Mark, in some painful and ludicrous embarrassment, related his meeting with Mr. Bolling, and the manner in which that impartial, disinterested gentleman had thrust himself upon him for life. "And where have you left him   now?" asked Rosalie. "At Col. Garner's, enjoying himself. Really,- my dearest Rose, I feel very much annoyed that you should be troubled with this old man," said Mark Sutherland, in a tone of vexation. "Bless your kind heart, dear Mark, he will be no trouble to me. I have not the shadow of an objection to his coming; I think I shall rather like to have him. Uncle Billy always was rather a cheerful object to me such a neat, clean, fresh, dainty, self-satisfied, delightful old gentleman! We can put him in the other front room up stairs, you know!" "But to be burdened with him for ever, Rosel Just \think of it I And the most provoking part of it is, he thinks he is doing us a mighty benefit 1" "WellI poor, homeless old gentleman I let him think so, if it makes him happy.

"Oh, yes; he says you're very fond of him, and begged me not to break   his arrival to you too abruptly, lest the sudden joy should be too much for you!" Rosalie laughed outright. Her silvery laughter was very sweet, from its rarity, and Mark found it charming. He' caught her gaily, and kissed her cheek. Oh, that burning   cheek I it sobered himr directly.

And: lastly, he wouldn't live -no, not in town   or country, neither for love nor money, with anybody who was' not' good-look- ing. There-to use Billy's own words-he set his foot down, and no one could move him from that position. And so it fell out that Billy'would accept no place in Shelton, but continued hanging on to the skirts of his old master and mistress, at Garner's Hotel. But one day, it happened that Rosalie, after she had dismissed her afternoon school, stood at her nice white kitchen table kneading bread for supper, when a shadow darkened the door, and the sound of something dumped suddenly down upon the floor, caused her to turn round. There stood Billy, in his pale blue cotton jacket And' trousers, and clean linen apron and' straw hat, with a great bundle at his back, and; a heavy trunk at his feet. Down he dropped the, bundle upon the trunk, and heaving a deep sigh of relief, said- "I'm been looking for you to send arter me to come and live 'long o' you. Why ain't you sent afore this? Don't like, to be a-losing so much tAne." "tWhy, Billy, I hiad no idea you wished tho c6me and live. With us,' :returhned Rose, in' surprise.

"I 'fused all ihem there," said Billy, chucking. his- thumb contemptuously over his shoulder, pointing, in the direction of the village-- " think I'm agoin' to live in. a bake-oven, like them there red brick houses?;: "But you might have gone to the country." "Yes, but you know most all on 'em were so ill- ooBking-I mean the people, and for that matter the houses/too-and then they kept- pigs, as made an onpleasant fragrance, and childun, as made-werry on- pleasant noises. And some places, the missus was either ugly in her temper, or her face, or in both, which is dreadful. Anid in other places the master was always a-iaterfering with the dinner or the dish- cloths, in a very misbecoming manner. Some on 'em were not nice in their wayvs; and what 'couragement would it be to me to put on a clean apron every day, with a nice stiff crease ironed down in the middle of it, to sarve people as wa'n't clean themselves? So the ' long and the short of it is, ma'am,; that I'm come to live 'long o' you." Now, Rosahe was so gentle-earted that she didc not speak her thought, and say--"But we did not send for you, Billy." Yet, nevertheless, Billy guessed it, for he answered as if she hadfspoken-- "Well, what o? that? Here I am. And here's my trunk and bundle. I paid a man twenty-five cents to help me to bring them over. I reckon I can stay, if I 'gree to, stay on your own terms," said Billy, betray- ing piteous anxiety nevertheless. Gentle and truthful Rosalie hastened to set his fears 22  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7865-00000169"/> at rest. "Indeed, Billy, we shall be delighted to have * you. You will be an invaluable acquisition to us. I am only very much surprised that you should have given us the preference."i A bright, glad smile brolie over honest Billy's face. CWhy, you see, ma'am, I don't care how much work I have to do-I does it cheerful. I don't care how little wages I gets-I takes it-contented. But I ain't got but one life to live on this yeth, and while I do live, I must live in a pretty place, long o' pretty people.  Anything else smothers of me-it stifles of me-it gives me the-I mean it makes my wittles disagree with me." And, so saying, Billy shouldered his bundle and trunk, and took them up into the loft over the kitchen, as if he had slept there all his life, and knew the way.   And then he came down, and   '- took  two big buckets to go to the well. And so, without more ado, Billy was inaugurated in his new I place and duties. And a  most "invaluable acquisi- tion" he really' proved. Billy had now been living several months with the Sutherlands. To return: -Rosalie went into the kitchen, to give directions to Billy about the supper. She-found him sitting down, stirring the batter for the pancakes. She told him she expected a stranger to tea, and that she must make coffee also, and dress two prairie fowls, and   broil some ham. And next she went into her dining-room and set her table, adorning it with her finest damask table-cloth, and best china, and placing upon it her nicest cakes and preserves. She was so * engaged when Mr. Sutherland returned, bringing in Uncle Billy. I  cannot do anything like justice to the vociferous   joy with which Mr. Bolling rushed upon his dear niece, as he called Rosalie. She received him with an affectionate welcome. "L I am come to stay with you as long as I possibly can, my dear. Although a man like me has a great many conflicting claims upon his time and presence, of course, nevertheless I intend to stay with you as long as possible." Rosalie assured him that the longer he stayed the better she should be pleased. And then, as Billy had put supper on the table, she invited him in to that meal. And MIr. Bolling sat down and enjoyed it with as much gusto as if he had not partaken of a heavy luncheon at Garner's. When supper was over, and Mr, Bolling had been invited by Mark to take a stroll around the premises, Billy entered, to clear off the table, and, pointing with his thumb over his shoulder, he asked- "Who is yon fat, puffed-up fellow in the rosy face and white jacket and trousers ?"  "He is my husband's uncle, and you must speak of him more respectfully." "That's 'cordin' as it may be," said Billy, as he moved off under the weight of the laden tea-tray. Rosalie's benevolent heart was so gratified at having some one else to be good to, and Mark was so pleased to see her satisfaction, that he became quite reconciled to the intruder.  'But Billy was not to be mollified.  When Mr. Bol- ling had been domesticated a week in the house, one morning  Billy bounced suddenly in upon Rosalie, as she stood arranging the breakfast-table, and asked- "How long is your uncle-in-law going to stay here ?"   &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7865-00000170"/> $56  INDIA.

There was no love lost on Mr. Bolling's side either, and-"Insolent fellow!" and "Is he an idiot?" and "You all spoil that fellow of yours, Mark!" fell often from his lips, and sometimes in honest Billy's hearing. And one day, while the family were all gathered round the dinner-table, Mr. Bolling said to his niece and nephew-"My dear children, I must request you to / drop the name of Uncle Billy, and substitute Uncle William, when you address me. There are two of that name in this house, and if you call mne Uncle Billy, strangers might confound me in some ray with Billy Bumpkin in the kitchen there, -which would not be complimentary." Rosalie afterwards thought -that her factotum must have heard these offensive remarks; for -he next evening, as she entered the kitchen, to order supper, he approached her respectfully, and said-  ". Mrs. Sutherland, ma'am, if you please, ma'am, I , would be thankful if you'd beo o-good as to call me William, which is the name given me by my sponsors in baptism, and not 'Billy,' for fear people might get me jumbled up in their minds-along o' that fat, lazy man, in white teeth and linen, which would lose me  I my good character, and be very onpleasant to my friends."

MARK SUTHERLAND had been home eight days before he broke to Rosalie the sad news of his uncle's betrayal of his trust, and her own loss of fortune. Rosalie heard it with sorrow and amazement. She replied by not one word, but dropped her head upon her haftds, and remained silent so long that her hus- band became anxious and alarmed.  In truth, it ras a most bitter disappointment to the young wife-she had looked forward to coming of age, and coming into possession of her fortune, with so much im- patience, with such bright anticipations, not for her- self, but for her husband's sake. It would have placed them in so much more favourable circum. stances It would have relaxed the tight strain of office work from the overtasked, weary lawyer, and left him more leisure for the study of the higher and more attractive and more honourable branches of his dry profession.  It would have afforded him means and leisure for engaging actively in political life, and never was the- country more in need of honest men "to the fore." It would have enabled him to assist largely in the public improvements of the growing city.  Nay, what good might they not have done   MAGNANIMTY.        359  with the large fortune that was lost? Indeed, it was a sudden, stunning blow to Rosalie; and ohI worse than all, was the thought of him whose guilty hand I had dealt that blow. She sat so long overwhelmed  ,i by the shock, that her husband--Heaven forgive him  I-misunderstood her silence and stillness, and misconstrued her noble heart. He said-       - "Rosalie, my love, look up I This loss of fortune, which you take so much to heart, is not inevitable, irrecoverable. Disclaim the signature, expose the forgery"- She raised her head, and looked up at him, with wonder in her mild, mournful eyes. "And what then?" "Your estate cannot then be touched by the forged mortgage." "And the man who confidingly loaned the money on the mortgage?" "Will lose forty thousand dollars." ' And Clement Sutherland?" "May go to the State's prison for ten years." She suddenly dropped her head upon her hands, and shuddered through all her frame, and remained silent for another while. And then she rose up and threw herself in his arms, and clasped him around the neck, saying- "We must lose it, dear Mark; we must lose itl Oh  I am so sorry for youl"   -  "My poor Rose, I knew what. your decision would be; I told the wretched man so. But, my dearest, it is proper that I should set the matter before you in its trige-ihght.

A WEEK after this, Mark Sutherland once more left home for a visit to Mississippi, on :business., He went to make a tfinal settlement with Clemenbt Suther- land. The miserable old man 'had fallen almost 'into a  state of idiotcy. :He gave up all the 'title deeds and varidus documents relating to Rosaliets estate, but could give little or no information  concerning them. The plantation was sold under the mortgage, and when all was done, and the final accounts cast up,. Mark Sutherland 'found that of all his Wife's splendid fortune, but a paltry two thousand dollars was left. With :this, Mark Sutherland prepared to leave the neighbourhood of Cashmere. -ut the day that -he had fixed for his departure was signalized   by a catastrophe that delayed his journey for weeks. It was the dreadful death of St. Gerald Ashey, who, during a fit of mania-a-potu, threw himself from a secohd story window, and, striking his head upon the iron trellise below, was instantly killed. India was distracted-Clement Sutherland helpless.  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7865-00000173"/> 862  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIvEK. And Mark remained at Cashmere to take the direction of the funeral. Three days from the death, when all was over, Mark Sutherland sought the presence of the widow. He went to her with no tender condulements, but with 'che words of bitter truth and stern rebuke upon his lips. He found her in her faded and dingy boudoir. She arose at his entrance, and held out her hand to welcome him, but before his own had touched it, she sank down in her chair, burst into tears, and covered her face with her hands. He took a seat, and spoke: "I come to you, Mrs. Ashey, with no vain words of sympathy, which would seem as untrue to your sense as they would be upon my lips. I come merely to set before you the stern realities of your position, and, if possible, to awaken you to its duties and re- sponsibilities." He paused a moment, and she lifted up her head and tearful face, saying, ". Seak, Mark I you will not find me haughty now!X His lips curled, and then he compressed them. "Your husband is dead I you know too well what fatal power brought down that high, proud nature to dishonouP and to death" "Speak-ay, speak-and spare not!   I deserve it I Most of all, from you!" she exclaimed, in a voice of anguish. "Yet, India, for the kindred blood in our mutual veins-for the regard I once bore you, and the anxiety I still feel for you--I would point out a way of re- covery"    aRETUTIONs.        363 "Tell me, Mark I tell med Oh I I know that'I I have been guilty but not wantonly, guilty, as you think I God knoweth that I have notl One mad, impatient act-one frantic act-led to all the rest-- ruined all my life and his!" "Yet that act could not have been committed by any but an intensely selfish nature, India. I speak not to indulge in vain reproaches, but to recall you to a sense of what you have already caused others to suffer, and to a consciousness of what you owe to others. You cannot now recall the past, but you are very young, and the long future is all yours. Your husband is dead, your father imbecile, and there is no one to take the direction of affairs on this plantation. You must rouse yourself from vain regret and indo- lent self-indulgence. You were not created to sit still and be Waited upon. ' You must engage in the active  duties of life. You must redeem the past by the future. You cannot now bring back St. Gerald Ash- ley from his dishonoured grave, and restore him to the brilliant and distinguished position from which he:  fell-but you can do somewhat to save his memory from reproach. He died heavily in debt. You have property of your own. This seat of Cashmere was : secured to you on your marriage, leaving your father a life-interest in it. I do not, therefore, mean this. But you have other property in your own right--do- vote it to the liquidation of Ashey's debts.

'What I mean to say is this: this poor, falc,n igirl is unprovided for, desolate, and heart-broken; and what I have to enjoin upon you is, that you seek out that poor victim of St. -erald's sin, and make such a provision for herself and child as will save her from despair and deeper vice." "And if I do all this-if I spend all that I have in clearing St. Gerald's mnemory from debt, and if I take this poor girl and her child under my protection-will you think of me more leniently than you do? Will you restore me your esteem?" "My thoughts, my esteem, should be no motive with you. I never asked you to do this for my sake. I would not ask you to do it for 'heaven's sake; but simply I enjoin you to do it because it is right, whether I ever remember 'your existence again or 'tot." "Oh Mark, I will do it. But you have not learned of Him, that divine, compassionate One, who would not break the bruised reed or quench the smoking flax!" She raised her eyes tearfully, doubtingly, to his face. "Is there anything else, Mark?" she asked. "Yes, India, your people; remember, that if your life should be cut off before you emancipate them, when your soul is in the spiritual world, you will see those whom you have left on earth, doomed, with their children and their children's children, to a bondage, from which you have no longer the power and the privilege to free them. Oh I think, India, it is a fearful responsibility, it is an awful one, to die and leave them so-to let the power of righting their wrongs pass away from you forever."   RESTITUTION. .. "To do all this it would require nearly all my means-it would leave me very poor." "Be poor! let all go but peace of minds" She paused a long time with her head; bowed upon her hands. At last she looked up, and stretched her hand out to him, and said- "Mark, is this all that you require of me?" "No; your father is imbecile in mind, and no longer capable of directing even his most trivial affairs. You must apply to the court for the necessary authority, and take the control of his estate. I will remain here a few weeks longer to aid you in obtaining it, and in settling up the accounts.. You will find many a just debt which nevertheless cannot legally be recovered of him. You must pay them all without flinching, though the settlement should leave you penniless. You must right every wrong that he has done, or others suffered through him." He had not taken the hand she had held out to him a few minutes before. It had fallen unheeded at her side. Yet now she laid it in his, as she, asked: "And if I do all this that you demand, then will you give me back regard?"  He looked disappointed and annoyed, and dropped her hand, as he replied: "If the fountain be not sweet, how shall the stream be? If the motive be not pure, how shall the act be? India do not seek to makera trader's bargain with heaven, or even with me!

It is contained in the lines of Pope's Universal Prayer: "' What conscience dictates to be done, Or warns me not to do- This teach me more than hell to shun, Thlat more than heaven pursue.' There is no clap-trap there, India; it is a sublime rule! Lay it to heart!" He had arisen, and was about to leave the room, but seeing her arms crossed upon the table, and her head fallen upon them in an attitude of the most desolate grief, he turned back, and laying his hand kindly upon the bowed head, he said: "Dear India, I am writing to Rosalie; shall I tell her to come down and remain with you for a few weeks?" "No, no! not now! I could not bear her presence here; it would bring back the memory of happier days, in too dreadful contrast with these. Not now!

During his stay he lodged at the village of C., because he found it itrmpos- sible to remain at Cashmere, where the presence of India, in her grief and desolation, seemed to scorch his very soul like a spiritual fire. He laboured very indus- triously, and, with the assistance of efficient lawyers and clerks, reduced the chaos of the Cashmere accounts into something like order, and made the way straight for the fuiture course of India and her attorney. At the end of the third week he completed his work, and bade adieu to India and to Cashmere. And in twelve days he was at home again. He was met near the house by Billy, who, with two baskets upon his arms, was proceeding upon some household errand. "Well! and so it's you, is it!" observed that func- tionary, setting down his baskets. "And so you've corned at last i" "How is your mistress, Billy?" inquired Mr. Suth- erland.

Very much disturbed by what he had heard, Mark Suther- land hastened o4. homeward. That, his paper was injured, and his income diminished, were compara- tively small matters; that his election was lost, was not a very great one; but that public confidence was shaken, and his influence impaired, was a misfortune. Anathematising Mr. Bolling's both-side-isms, which now seemed to lave reached al/-side-ism, 1e passed through the green gate leading into his own lawn, Rosalie, who had seen his approach from afar, came down from, the house to meet him. She looked smiling and happy, as she gave him both her hands. Her cheerful confidence raised his hopes. I{e greeted her fondly, and then drew her arm within his own. And as they walked slowly back to the house- "Well, Rosalie!" he said, "what about this con- founded editorial of Mr. Bolling's? It is not enough, it seems, that he should be a kill-joy in the house and by the fireside, but he must be a mar plot abroad, andl an evil genius to. our business!"   RESSTITUlON.       869 Rosalie laughed gaily. "Oh, it is nothing," she said; "it was just one of Mr. Bothsides' grand, broad, impartial manifestoes. It took our people, both friends and opponents, very much by surprise, perplexed them not a little, and finally made them laugh. No one, for an instant, could have attributed such a leader to you, even if they had not been advised of your absence and exclu- sive engagement elsewhere. Besides, in to-day's paper the publisher explains that the article was from 'the pen of a transient contributor. Why do you still look so grave? It is not possible that poor, daft Billy has really alarmed you with his gossip. Psha! even inno- cents of Billy's mental calibre could scarcely impute the sentiments of that foolish leader to you." Grave! Well he might look grave; but not upon the subject of leading editorials, public sentiment, popular applause, or popular execration. He wondered now, how such trifles could have discomposed him. There she was--the angel of his life-walking by his side, leaning on his arm, looking very. smiling and happy, talking cheerily laughing sweetly; but, ohl that face was so fair and wan--that pearly forehead so greatly developed, so polished from the tension of the skin- those large, shadowy eyes, so deeply luminous --those crimson flushes in the hollow cheek, so intense and fiery-that whole countenfance, irradiated with such unearthly, supernal light Why should he look grave? He answered her question in some trivial way -said he was not grave, or something to that effect, and put on a look' and manner of ease and light- heartedness-strangers, alasl to his bosom, from this time forward many a day!

He did not support her steps with his usual tenderness and solicitude. A sort of fierce jealousy and antagonism to disease and death took possession of him-a sort of instinct that, by denying their existence, he might disable their might-a kind of feeling that, by disbelieving Rosalie's weakness, and disallowing her yielding to disease, he might save her from the power-of death. With more refined spiritual insight than he pos. sessed, Rosalie perceived his thoughts and emotions; and, as much as possible, avoided giving him pain. She never betrayed weariness, if the exercise of the greatest fortitude and patience could conceal her sufferings; she never complained, never even alluded to her mortal illness, \o   IMMORTALITY.          871 CHAPTER XXXIII.

INi the political world, the next year, the spirit of party ran very high. A great moral as well as national problem agitated and divided the whole country.  Mark Sutherland had been nominated by the Human Rights as their candidate for the United States Senate; he had accepted the nomination, and his friends laboured perseveringly and anxiously for his election. Rosalie, as usual, entered heart and soul into all his toils and anxieties.  "And not for ourselves, dearest Mark," she said; "'not for our own profit or vainglory-for that were a poor, mean, narrow motive, and a low, selfish aiml-nor for your own personal honour, Mark--though to him who is worthy of it, to him who appreciates and accepts its duties and responsibilities in the right religious spirit, a seat in the American Senate is a great honour- nor even for your future fame, Mark-not from    any  &#xD;<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7865-00000178"/> 372  INDIA.

For this I hope, and trust, and labour, and would, if need were, die!"  And upon another occasion, when he was vexed and harassed, wearied and despondent, and inclined to give up the object as little worthy the labour or the pains, she said to him, sweetly-for her very tone and manner had a soothing, encouraging spell e - "Remember what Mountford says: 'Fame is a great thing for a man; it is silence for him when he wants to speak; it is a platform to preach from, more authori-. tative than a monarch's throne; it is an affectionate attention from a multitude of hearers.' Win fame, Mark-win the silence that will wait for your voice; the platform more authoritative than the monarch's throne; the reverential- attention of multitudesl Only let sounds of words of truth and justice fall upon the silence; principles of righteousness speak from the platform; and the confiding attention of the crowd be rivetted to the glorious right!" High, inspiring words of holiness like these fell daily from her lips. But Rosahe was dying--dying all the faster because- her failing oil of life was con- sumed so ungrudgingly-her lamp of life shone so brightly, giving light where it was needed. Yes, Rosahe was dying, and her husband did not dream of it. Soothed into rest by her own sweet patience, and by the slowness and beauty of her failure, he did not dream of it He left her with an increased bur-   IMMORTALITY.        878 den of duties. At the urgent entreaties of his political friends, he went to show himself among the voters of the western counties.  He was absent about a month, during which she toiled for "the good- cause" faithfully-saying, when her strength was failing, "There will be time enough for rest here- after; I must 'work while it is yet day, for the night cometh wherein no man can work."' And so, at the close of her daily school duties, she only left her school desk to seat herself in the editor's vacant chair; and the hours that should have been spent in recreation and rest, and the hours that belonged - to sleep, were devoted to the interests of "the paper,"' and the cause it supported-to writing editorials, to reading and answering letters, examining ex- changes, and propitiating or putting down opposi- tion. 1Mark Sutherland returned at the end of the month, with the flush of hope upon his cheek, the light of anticipated triumph in his eyes; but both light and colour faded from his face- at the sudden sight of- Rosalie's brilliant eyes and burning cheeks. Was it strange that he never was struck by her illness, except upon meeting her after an absence? On the contrary, I think it was natural, for a few days accustomed him to her appearance; and her sweet patience, her cheerfulness and hope, mes- merised him into peace and joy. :But this time, as he drew her into the house, he said- "Indeed, Rosalie, you must, you shall give up your school. You are not strong enough to continue it Besides, it is not needful.

"Dear Mark, whenever you make a circuit among our hardy country people, you come back thinking me more fragile than ever, from the contrast." And so she reassured him-and oh I he was very willing to be reassured--and she continued the charge of her school-anxious for every good principle she could instil into the minds of her young pupils- saying to herself, "These little ones will hereafter be the wives and mothers of law-makers, as all our people are law-makers; they will live in an era when Ameri- can women will have more influence upon the destinies of the nation than they dream of now. That influence must be for the right; I must sow the good seed, and cultivate it while I live, that, after I die, the germ may grow and flourish, and bring forth much fruit in other lives!" But the day came at last when her school had to be closed, and the labourer was obliged to rest from her labour. It was during the afternoon session of a certain Friday-a day never to be forgotten by the young girls, who loved their gentle teacher with en-   thusiastic devotion-in the midst of one of the class- exercises-a little extempore lecture on their history lesson-that a sudden failure of strength drew all colour from her face, her head dropped, forward on her desk, and she swooned. And after this she did not teach. Her school was opened but once mere, and for the last time. It was the day that she received her pupils for the purpose of bidding them farewell. It was quite a cheerful parting on her part, saddened   IMMORTALITY.        875    -- by no vain repining; on theirs, darkened by no vision  of the shadow of death. She made it the occasion of a little festival, that her children's last reminiscences of her might be associated with pleasant thoughts; and yet it was an earnest parting, too, that she sought to sanctify to their good. In taking leave of each dear girl, she laid upon the heart of each a text of Scripture, suited to the individual need, to be remem- bered for her sake, and acted upon until they should meet again. For instance, Regina's besetting sin was ambition, and with her she left, "What shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole'world and lose his own soul?" and to Augusta, who had a haughty mind, she said, "Pride goeth before a fall, and a haughty spirit before destruction;" to Maud, who had a high temper, she whispered, "A soft answer turneth away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger;" to little Alice, who was poor and neglected, and inclined-child as she was-to despondency, she said, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth;" to Fanny, who was an impetuous, impassioned child of impulse, she said, "He that ruleth his own spirit is greater than he who taketh a city." All these the affectionate girls promised to lay to heart, and act upon until they should meet their teacher again. Only Fanny said she hoped their dear teacher would not treat them as Lycurgus did: the Spartans, and leave them laws to be obeyed during her absence, and then go away, never to return. A cloud passed 'over the sunshine of Rosalie's counte- nance; but after a little hesitation she said, "If I live, dear girls, I will return'in the spring." -And soon after saying this, she dismissed all the bright-eyed, light-hearted children t their homes.  &#xD;<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7865-00000180"/> (76  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. Rosahe had been directed by her physician to spend the fall and winter in the South. She had an old, standing engagement to spend a few months in Loui- siana, at the house of the Lauderdales, with whom she had kept up a regular correspondence. But, previous to embracing this opportunity of benefitting her health by accepting the invitation, Rosalie wrote to her step- mother, telling her frankly of the feeble state of her health and the precarious tenure of her life, and of the order of her physician relative to her removal South; but expressing, at the same time, her dread of the inconvenience and trouble to which her illness and death at their house might possibly subject her host and hostess. There could but one possible answer to such a letter suggest itself to the mind of Rosalie's affectionate step-mother-it was an answer in her own person. Accordingly, in about two weeks from the day that Rosalie mailed her letter to Mrs. Lauder- dale, that lady arrived at Shelton, stopping only long enough at the hotel to write a note to Mark Suther- land, requesting him to break the news of her presence to Rosalie, and then come and take her to his wife. The meeting between Rosalie and her step-mother was most affectionate and tender; but the patience of Rose and the self-possession of Mrs. Lauderdale restrained their mutual agitation. Mrs. Lauderdale had come, in person, to take her step-daughter to Louisiana, that she might nurse and watoh over her during the journey. And as soon as she found her- self alone with Mark Sutherland, she said- "And you must let her go at once, dear Mark. She "s iller than you think; and the mornings and the eve- nings are already chill in this bleak clime. Yes, dear   IMMORTALITY.       3" Mark, you must let her go at once; and if you cannot possibly leave your political interests here, you may confidently trust her to me on the journey, for I love her as my own child, and will not leave her, night or day; and you can join us as soon as you get through this bustling and bothersome election." "No, I will never suffer her to go without me. I will accompany her--ttend upon her. I will never leave her again. Let the election go. What is suc- cess to me, if I lose her? You do not know all that she has been to me-all that she is to me- Mrs. Lau- derdale I I tell you, if she should sink into the grave, earth could not offer me a boon so welcome as the half of that grave!" A few days after this, the whole party set out for the South, and in a little more than a week arrived at the beautiful home of the Lauderdales. Lincoln Lauderdale met and received them with hearty cordiality. Upon the very day that Mrs. Lau. derdale had left home to go up the river and visit her step-daughter, she had written to Mrs. Wells, and in- vited her to come to Louisiana to meet her daughter- in-law, and perhaps her son. This was done by the kind-hearted little lady with the purpose of effecting a reconciliation between the long-estranged members of the family. And now, on reaching home again, among the letters upon her boudoir table she found one from Mrs. Wells, saying that the Doctor had gone for an indefinitely long absence to California, and that she should be pleased to accept the invitation of Mrs. Lauderdale, who might expect her about the middle of the month. "And the day after to-morrow is the sixteenth, so, - "!  &#xD;<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7865-00000181"/> 878  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVRK. Mark, you may daily expect the arrival of your mother," said Mrs. Lauderdale, looking up from the epistle. And then she told them of her invitation. Upon that very afternoon Mrs. Wells arrived. The meeting between herself and her son took place alone, by her request. It was not known what happened at that interview, except that she sobbed a long time on his shoulder, and that a full reconciliation ensued. To Rosalie her manner was very affectionate. But Rosalie, from the time of her reaching Fair- plains, failed very fast. lShe now seldom left her easy chair by the western window. It was the pleasantest and most beautiful room in the house that had been assigned the invalid-a. room occupying the first floor of a whole wing of the house, and with its east win- dows looking far out upon the green alluvion that stretched to the sandy beach of the distant gulf, and with its west windows opened upon a beautiful gar- den, beyond which spread fields reaching out to the dark pine forest that stood stately against the sunset aky. At this sunset window was her favourite after- noon seat; and here, with her friends grouped around her, she smiled and conversed as sweetly, as cheer- fully, if more faintly, than ever; or here, with only her husband seated by her side, she would sit with her thin hand in his, looking into his eyes with such infinite, unutterable love and devotion, as though she would transfuse all her mind, and soul, and spirit into his being, to strengthen him for his life's trial and work. Every mail brought him piles of letters from his political friends and correspondents: but they lay unanswered, unopened. upon his secretary. Some-   IMMORTALITY.        879 times she would inquire about the prospects of the party; he could tell her little, he thought little, he cared little about it; and she would fix her mild eyes in mournful wonder upon him. Soon the pleasant seat by the sunset window was given up for the couch, and too soon the couch was left for the bed, from which she was never to rise again. Then it was, after her confinement to her bed, that they approached a subject that both had hitherto avoided discussing together-her dissolution. She still spoke to him of the good cause--the cause of jus- tice, truth, and freedoms. She implored him to let no individual sorrow draw him away from his labours of love to the whole race of man; rather to consecrate that sorrow to their service. And still she inquired about the prospects of his election to the Senate. She so much wished to see him in the possession of place and power before her death.           r "Not alone for your sake, dearest Ma-rk," she still repeated; " not alone for your sake, biut for the sake of humanity." "Oh, dearest Rosalie, why should I wish for success? When you have left me, what motive of action have I on earth?"                 " "A motive higher than any my life could supply you with-the service of God, the good'of man." And all this time piles of accumulated and accumu- lating letters from political partisans lay unopened and unanswered, on his forsaken secretary. At last the day of death came-a clear, beautiful day, that, after the noontide' glory, waned without a clotud.              .

She slept calmly for a while, and then her bosom was agitated by a slight flutter; it came a second and a third time; and then, with a start and a gasp, she awoke, opened her eyes, and gazed wildly about for an instant; then her glance fell on Mrs. Wells, sitting watching by her bed-side. That lady arose, and, bending affection. ately over the invalid, inquired- "What do you want, dearest? Will you take your composing draught now?" The eyes of the death-stricken Rosalie softened into self-possession and quietness, and she answered faintly, "No, mother, not now. Where is Mark?" "On the piazza, dear." "Sleeping?" "No; waiting for his darling to awake." "Send him to me, mother. I wish to see him alone." The lady stooped, and pressed a loss upon the chill brow of the dying girl, and without uspicion went out; an" in half a minute Mark stood over Rosalie. She raised her eyes, a little wild with the life-strug- gle, to his pale face. "My hour is come; I am going, dear Mark; I am going I Turn me over on my right side, facing you.

And then he wished to call assist-.   IMMORTALITY.      .- 881 ance; but with an imploring look and gesture she- arrested his purpose, and said, "Useless, dear Mark! useless all. Oh I sit near me, where I can see you till the last, and so-- part in peace sweetly." She lay upon-her right side, with her face towards him, with her fair hair floating back upon the pillow, with her blue eyes raised with unspeakable love to his countenance, with her left hand lying helplessly, over the white counterpane.   . He sunk down into the chair by her side; he took her chill hand in his own warm one; he gazed upon r dying face. And, as he gazed, a slight spasm agi- tated her fair throat, quivered over the sweet lips, and gave place to a heavenly smile. She sought to speak, but her words sank in quivering music-her eyes fixed upon his eyes--pouring their last light in streams of unutterable love into his soul-and so they remained, until the heavenly spirit left them dim in death. And still he sat gazing upon the dead face, holding the cold hand, until a noise in the piazza disturbed him, and words and tones of joy and triumph fell upon his ear-and a familiar'voice, asking- "Where is Mark? where is he? I swore to be the first to con- gratulate him, and I'll do it I will not be hindered, I tell you!" and in another instant Uncle Billy burst r. into the room, and, overjoyed, bewildered, blinded,"  rushed upon Mark, who had risen to prevent him, seized both his hands, exclaiming exultingly- "Judge Sutherland, you are elected, sir!

Mr. Balling drew nigh, in sudden awe and grieg  and his heart almost stood still, as he inquired, with hushed tones- "Dead ." "No!" replied  Mark  Sutherland, reverently,-- "'IMMORTAL!"'

Alas 1 alas I he felt now as if nothing were . 1 immortal but his own bitter, insupportable grief; as if with her all things had' passed from him--- leaving only insufferable sorrow.

Pass we by the funeral, where all who had known the angel in her mortal life, gathered around to gaze once more upon her sweet face, drop a tear to her lovely memory, and go away, haply, wiser, and more loying-than they came. Pass by the time when the news of her departure from this earth reached her distant Western home, and many other homes that felt the blessing of he^ influence and mourned her loss; and where to this day the memory of Rosalie is still fresh and beau- tiful, sweet and fragrant-even as that of some fair' saint, who lived, and loved, and toiled, and suffered to benefit humanity, to whom she was given; and where the present thought of Rosalie is as that of some bright guardian angel, still blessing from heaven those she loved upon the earth.          : Pass to the time when Mr. Sutherland's official duties called him to Was!ngton City.

But all this passed to him like a dream, or at least like a form in which he had no vital interest. It was well for Mark Sutherland that he was a man of very Imposing presence-that his bearing was dignified and commanding, and his fine Roman features, even in the deepened repose, as in a painting, or a marble bust, still expressed a high de. gree of intellect; as, through that fortuitous accident of physique, taken together with his antecedents, which were not those of a negligent politician-his mental abstraction passed for the pride and reserve of a lofty mind-which it was not-rather than for the pro- found indifference, amounting almost to apathy, of a deeply stricken heart-as it was. Time passed, and the "affairs of the nation" got slowly under way. And the "assembled wisdom" of the commonwealth took up its profoundest problems. Debate after debate arose, and questions in which he had once taken the profoundest interest-but they had now no power to affect or inspire him. Into society he did not go at all; but left the Capitol only for his boarding-house, and his boarding-house only for a ride or a walk out into the country. So the session passed, and Mr. Sutherland had failed to distinguish himself, or to do credit to his consti- tuents. He had apparently done no service to him- self, his party, humanity or heaven. His best friends were surprised, grieved and disappointed in him. He returned home; met his constituents with the same apathetic, frozen indifference. What was the matter? - It was soarcely credible even to himself that the *? --   sorrow that had fallen upon him-a sorrow no heavier apparently than that which falls upon many a man and woman, who nevertheless "take up their burden of life again," and go on-should have so paralyzed his intellect and his will. Had all his motive power departed with Rosalie? Had she been the secret and the fountain of his mental and moral force? He had often said so and thought so, during her mortal life; and now it seemed to be demonstrated. He once thought of resigning his seat in the Senate, and spoke of his failing health as a reason for doing so; but his personal friends dis- suaded him from his half-formed purpose. And about this time Lincoln Lauderdale wrote and invited Mark Sutherland to join him in a trip to England. Mr. Sutherland accepted the invitation. The friends met by appointment at St. Louis, and travelled in company to New York, and embarked together for Liverpool. The voyage was made. The summer was spent in travelling through England, Scotland and Ireland. And in the autumn they returned to the United States, and reached Washington City just before the meeting of Congress. The trip had been made without much benefit to the health and spirits of Mr. Sutherland. And Mr. Lauderdale, with much uneasinfess in regard to the state of his friend, took leave of himtin Washington, and departed for the South.  The two Houses of Congress organized, in the  course of time, and the nation's business commenced. And'again Mr. Sutherland sat a mere silent, handsome figure-head in his seat.     !  24  *"         ,  -!  - -I  &#xD;<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7865-00000185"/> In fact, it required-not travel and change of scene, not the offices of friendship, nor the distinctions of society, but some powerful emotion, something that should sound a trumpet-call to his heart and brain- some mental or moral shock-to rouse that dormant mind to life and action. And it camel In the midst of a calm as profound as a sleep of peace, the thunderbolt fell that struck con. sternation, not only among all right-thinking men upon the floor of Congress, but all honest souls to the remotest bounds of the Union. It was in the midst of the temporary calm I have just mentioned, that a Senator arose and presented a bill for the repeal of a treaty hitherto held so sacred that the most reckless of political adventurers had not dared to dream of meddling with it until now. It was no very extravagant figure of speech to call that event a thunderbolt. It took the Senate, the House, and the nation by surprise.  It had the momentary stunning effect of a thunderbolt when it fell. Men were struck with consternation, heard as doubting the evidence of their own senses, and for a time remained dumb with astonishment. Then followed indignation which we all know to be anything but a "dumb devil," whether it possess a man or a body of men. And a tempest of opposi- tion arose that in its turn provoked a storm of assault from the friends of the bill, and then the war raged fast and furious. Not very "parliamentary" was the character of the debates upon that question, for it was indeed a time that "tried men's souls," "what man- ner of spirit they were of." Mr. Sutherland was among the foremost, most earnest * A.   TlLii BUK'rTHEN OF LIFE. '  S7  and strenuous among the opponents of the bill. I have said elsewhere that if Mark Sutherland were remark- able for one trait above all others it was for his severe sense of justice. It was this that had led, or rather driven him to his early sacrifices; it was this that had governed all his coujct and changed the whole cur- rent of his life. And it was this sense of justice stung to the quick that had roused the dormant faculties of his mind, and woke his spirit "all the stronger that it slept so long." With all his strength of intellect and will, he wrought in the cause of national good faith and political righteousness, both at stake in the" issue of the pending. act. Other men, abler men, older men, veterans in the political arena, toiled with equal zeal and greater power, and long and faith- fully was the contest kept up. All that man could do to prevent that breach of political faith was done;  but, alasl the powers of evil carried the day: the bill  was passed, the sacred treaty repealed, and the cause of justice lost at least for the time. At the close of this the second session of his services, Mr. Sutherland returned once more to his home and to his constituents, who received him with cordiality; he had done what was possible for the cause of right. Thus six years passed in the distracting life of a poli- tician, six years since his Rosalie went to heaven, and still Mark Sutherland was a lonely man. He now entered society freely, boti in Washington City, during the session of Congress, and at the various  watering-places, or at home in his own adopted State. But neither the rustic beauty of the country maidens in his own neighbourhood, nor the refined grace of  the city belles that yearly congregate at the capita l,  &#xD;<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7865-00000186"/> 888   INDIA.

And at the end of six years' widowhood, though still in the early prime of life, eminently handsome and graceful, and as distinguished for elegance and accomplishments in the drawing room as for talent and eloquence in the Senate chamber; though honoured by the country and courted by society; though constantly thrown amrnong the young, the beautiful, the gay and the fascinating; though admired by women as well as distinguished by men-Mark Sutherland was still alone-still faith- ful to an earthly memory that had also become a heavenly hope, and his angel-wife, Rosalie, had no mortal rival.

When India had administered upon the estate of her deceased father, who had survived the discovery of his guilt but a few months,-when she had settled every just claim upon it,-she found herself, as she had predicted, very poor. When the last debt was paid, the surplus fund was so small that it would not have met even her moderate expenses for one year. And the once haughty India, haughty now no longer, found it necessary to do something for her own support. In a legal point of view, it was not by any means obligatory upon India to impoverish her- self to pay her father's or her husband's debts. A portion of the property, sufficient for her own com- fortable and even elegant maintenance, she might still have withheld from the creditors; but with a late though noble sense of justice-emulative of Mark's own strict rectitude-she resolved to pay the uttermost farthing, and clear, as much as possible, from blame the memory of the dead, by cancelling, at least, their pecuniary obligations; even though by doing so she should leave herself quite penniless. In vain her friends and neighbours remonstrated. India, once so obstinate in wrong, could be equally firm in right. The estate settled, the creditors all paid off, all other claims of justice satisfied, and India, with a small surplus, turned to consider what next she should do. In the South, luxurious houses enough were open to her.

THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. her fortune from the claims of justice--were eloquent in the praise of that high sense of honour that led her to disregard alike her own self-interest and their benevolent counsel. And many among the wealthy families of her acquaintance, with true Southern hospitality, invited and pressed her to come and make their house her home for as long as she liked. And there is no doubt but that the high-born, beautiful, and accomplished young widow, would have been considered a great acquisition in the drawing-room of any country house. But at no time of her life would India have endured such a life of luxurious dependence-and even now, when her heart had been disciplined and chastened by sorrow, she much pre- ferred the honest independence of labour. Therefore she gratefully and somewhat proudly, withal, declined the invitations of her friends, bade them kindly adieu, and left the neighbourhood. Something of the old haughty reserve remaining, perhaps, induced her to cover her retreat. And so- many of her friends-Mark among others--had quite lost trace of her. And she, also, had lost sight of all, except of Mark Sutherland, whose rising star she watched from afar, with mingled emotions of pride, joy, and passionate regret. She had effectually hidden herself in the great city of New York, where, as a teacher of music and draw- ing, she lived in strict retirement, and whence she watched the upward progress of the successful statesman. At the close of his first senatorial term, Mark Sutherland had been set up as the candidate of the   TO WED THE EARLIEST LOVED.    391 liberal party for one of the highest offices in thefgift of the people. Political business, about this uime, called Mr. Sutherland to New York. He was received with enthusiasm by the friends of his party, and when his business was dispatched, he entered freely into the fashionable society of the city. India had seen his arrival announced with the usual flourish of the press trumpets. And every day she saw his honours and his triumphs chronicled in the morning and evening papers. She could not bear the thought of meeting him in her poverty now. But in that extensive wilderness of crowded buildings; called New York, she believed herself as completely screened from observation and discovery as though she had been away in London or in Paris, or in a desert or a forest. And she also felt assured that he had not the slightest clue to her dwelling place. But it happened that, during his sojourn in New York, Mr. Sutherland had consented, with feelings partly of amusement and partly of annoyance, to sit for his portrait, to adorn some lyceum or lecture room. And the painting had been finished and hung up, and had attracted crowds of his friends and ad- mirers-for a few days-and then had been left "alone in its glory." One morning, at an hour so early that it was-highly improbable he should find any other visitors there, Mr. Sutherland went to the lyceum to procure a rare folume on jurisprudence. The librarian was in his itall, but otherwise the room seemed deserted. Perhaps Mr. Sutherland's foot was light in" -stepping --perhaps the carpet was thick and soft, or it might be that the lady he presently saw standing before his  &#xD;<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7865-00000188"/> Y2   INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. portrait was so abstracted that she could not hear the entrance of another visitor. At all events, she did not perceive his approach, and Mr. Sutherland went past, selected his volume, and had turned to go back, when a casual glance at the lady, and a flutter of her brown veil, disclosed to his astonished eyes the face of India. He could scarcely suppress an exclamation of joy His first impulse was to spring forward and greet her. Had he been,some years younger, he would have done so on the spur of the moment; but age brings caution and teaches self-restraint; and it was well he refrained, for a second glance at that pale, impassioned face, with those dark, burning eyes, fixed with such a fascinated gaze upon the picture before her, warned him that by no rude shock must that colourless, motionless woman be approached. Softly and silently he drew away towards the other extremity of the long room, where the librarian sat in his stall. "Mr. Ferguson, do you know the lady at the other end of the room?" he inquired of that gentleman. "No, I do not," answered the librarian, after taking a look at India. "Nor where she lives, of course?" "Nor where she lives," said the librarian, looking up in some surprise. "I supposed her to be a lady that I once -knew, but I did not like to speak to her in uncertainty-that is all," said Mr. Sutherland, evasively. The librarian was a grave man, as it. befitted a. custodian of grave books to be, and Mr. Sutherland's reputation for unvarying propriety of deportment was   XV Uo '1'-t1i T AliELIEST LOVED. a 5; beyond cavil, so there was no quizzing, and their talk ended there. Mark Sutherland went down into the lobby, con- sidering how best to introduce himself, without start- ling Mrs. Ashey. He might wait until she should come down, and then follow her home, ascertain her address, and call upon her the next day; but there appeared to him to be something about such a course as that he did not approve, something romantic, ab- surd, yet verging upon treachery. Besides, it was most probable that she would take an omnibus, when he should lose sight of her, unless, indeed, he should get into the same omnibus; to which there was the same great objection of presenting himself suddenly before her, which, after seeing the expression of her face, he dared not do; while, at the same time, it was the re- collection of that very look that made him doubly anxious to meet her. After considering a while, he determined to address a letter to her through the city post-office. That would certainly reach her sooner or later. He went home and put his purpose into execution. He was unfit for study or for society that day. That sudden meeting with India, the revelation made by that look upon her worn but still lovely face, had stricken the rock in his bosom, and the long-sealed fountain of memory and affection was set free. That motionless, colourless, most beautiful-faceit haunted him all the day. That afternoon he dressed to go to a dinner party, at a house on Fifth Avenue. On arriving at the v'tfJe, just as he entered the hall, a lady closely veiled went out. That form and air he could not be mistaken  &#xD;<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7865-00000189"/> 394  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVEIK. Again, with a start of irrepressible pleasure, he had recognised India. "Who is that lady?" he inquired of the "Jeemes" of that hall. "The music  mistress, yer honour," answered "Jeemes," who happened in this case to be, "Patrick." "'Do you know where she lives?" 'I'll inquire, yer honour," replied Patrick, opening the drawing-room door to admit the guest, and then departing on his errand. In a few moments he re- turned, with Mrs. Ashey's address.  A It was in a distant part of the city. Yet gladly would Mark have sought out her retreat that night, had he been free to do so; but nothing but the most urgent' necessity could now have excused him from the dinner got up in his own honour. So he was forced to restrain his impatience for that evening. Nay, more; having found out her residence and men- tally fixed the hour that he should see her the next morning, he gave himself up to the festivities of the evening, and was once more the brilliant conversa- tionist he was reputed to be. At dinner, he led in and sat next one of the most charming women in New York, and no doubt did his devoirs with equal grace and pleasure. Yet neither is there any doubt that he was well satisfied when the evening's hospitality was over. And he was still better pleased when the night was passed, and the morning came, and the sun arose, and he at last had leave to dress himself, dispatch an earl* breakfast, take a cab, and drive to the remote suburb where India lived. Was it a private dwelling or a boarding-house?   TLU WiiL "jt-u SASKLIEST LOVED.  395 The address gave no clue to that question-it desig- nated only the street and the number. He hoped it was a private dwellingl He must see her alone 1 How would she receive him? There was no mis- taking that look upon her face that had thrilled him, striking the whole " electric chord" of memory and pas- sion I that look of mingled affection, aspiration, and passionate regret How would she receive him? Such were the glad, anxious, questioning thoughts that chased each other through his mind, while the cab rolled on. In these tumultuous, half-delightful, half-painful recollections and anticipations the dis- tance was passed. "This is the place, sir," said the driver, as the cab drew up before a little cottage, surrounded by a small luxuriant flower garden, ahd literally covered and concealed by a complete thicket of tall rose-trees and climbing vines. "So this is a private dwelling, and her love of beautiful surrounding survives all the crash of for- tune and the wreck of life," thought Mark Sutherland, as he alighted and opened the gate leading into the yard. Let us precede him, by a few moments. India, who had risen from an almost untasted break- fast, had passed into the small parlour only to escape the eyes of her attendant, the pretty, loving Oriole, who had followed the fortunes of her mistress with the most devoted affection and fidelity, and who, if a cloud did but fall upon the brow of Mrs. Ashey, re. fleeted it in the sadness of her own face. But this morning, in the bitterness of her emotions, India could not endure the sad, wistful glances of poor  &#xD;<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC7865-00000190"/> 396  INDIA. THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER. Oriole; so she had left the small sitting-room impa. tiently, and passed into the parlour, where she paced up and down with the fearful, half-suppressed excite- ment of some caged lioness. Disciplined and chastened as her heart certainly had been in the trials of her life, India was still very far from Christian perfection. And, perhaps, now she needed a little of the sunshine of happiness, as well as the long, long cloud of sorrow, to nurture the growth of goodness in her heart. At all events, she found it very difficult to bear with fortitude the mortifi- cation and grief of the night before. She had met him on the steps of one of those Fifth Avenue palaces, where her pupils resided. She had met him! he had passed her, brushing her dress as he went I Though her veil was down, she had recognized him. And she knew by the start that he made, he recognized het as well! Yet he had passed without speaking! Ah I all her thoughts of the future possibilities of a rencounter that she dreaded and shrunk from, had not shaped a meeting so humiliating as this I She had feared that he would seek her out, and, from his pride of place, presume to patronize her, by endeavouring to improve her circumstances, giving her advice, offering her as- sistance-humiliations which to escape she would have fled to an alms-house-or, perhaps, plunged into a river, " but for the race of God," for India was but half regenerated. But a rencounter so mortifying as this, she had never dreamed of. All the circumstances attending that chance meeting also combined to make it inexpressibly galling-he going into that house an honoured guest, for whom its saloons were illuminated and a feast prepared, and a choice company gathered:   xu W I 'TMJE; EARLIEST LOVED.  397 she creeping out of it, a sort of hired servant with her wages in her hand. So, in the present bitterness ot her mood, she looked at herself. And they had so met upon the steps, and he had seen her, recognized her, and passed her without speaking!"Ah I fool!" so she thought; "there was little need to dread that he would seek me out to benefit me. The 'great statesman' evidently has no wish to be bored by his poor relations. But oh, Mark! Mark! that you should have done such an unworthy thing! you, my one saving idea of manly excellence-that prosperity should have corrupted, and the world hardened, even you!  When you upbraided me so bitterly, in the midst of my sorrows at Cashmere, I bore it all with a meekness--not very like me! because-oh 1 because I saw and felt what you would never acknowledge to your own heart-the secret, unacknowledged feeling that gave point, sting, and acrimony to all the bitter reproaches you uttered.  Oh Mark, in that day I read your heart as a woman only can!  But all this is over--over-and you pass me without recognition," she said, sinking into a chair, dropping her head upon her hands, and giving way for the first time in years to a passionate flood of tears. Hark! the bell rings-Oriole goes to the door. It is probably the postman, and India is too much de- pressed, and has too little-to hope, to care much about the coming of that messenger of joy or of woe toso many households. But hark!I "Why, how do you do, Oriole? Do you recollect me, child?  Yes?  I am very glad to see you here  How is your mistress?  Is she in?" It is a rich, full-toned voice that speak--a cordiaf  &#xD;<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7865-00000191"/> f 2 familiar, life-giving voice-a voice that has power to thrill every nerve in her frame-in a word, it is Mark Sutherland's voice I and he is in the little hall, and in another mnoment he will be in the room. Oh I Heaven her face is pale, and bathed with tears -he must not see her thus I! In a moment the blinds are drawn down, the curtains dropped, and the room obscured, and her chair is wheeled around with its back to the windows, so as to throw her face into deep shadow. So she will await him. But Oriole enters alone, with a card. "It is Mr. Sutherland, madame, and if you are dis- engaged he will be glad to see you." She- bows in assent--she can do no more; and Oriole goes out, returns, and ushers in Mr. Suther- land. "Mrs. Ashey"-- She rises, and extends her hand. "Mrs. Ashey, I am very happy to see you again." She essays to speak, but fails, and her self-pos- session utterly deserts her. The hand he has taken is cold as ice-he carries it to his lips. "My dearest India, I am so happy to find you again, after all these years." "All these years l"-she repeats his words, mecha- nically, as she sinks back in her chair. He takes the nearest seat, and resumes-- I have sought you far and wide, I have sought you for so long, I have done all but advertise you!"He added, smiling-"Why have you hidden yourself so long from all your friends?" "The old 'sinful pride' perhaps, Mark," she an- swered, half smiling in her turn.   "Pride,' dear India? Ah! I understand you. Yet that same pride, in all its phases, has caused much vexation to those who love you, dear India." "Do I not know it? And do I not regret it?" "And to none has it caused more trouble than to myself."--But the conversation is growing personal, and closing in. ' You and I, reader, are de trop--and will withdraw from the scene and wait. The result was this--that Mr. Sutherland did not leave New York as soon as he had expected; by many weeks. And one Sunday, before morning service, there was a quiet marriage ceremony performed before the altar of Grace Church. And the next morning, in the list of passengers that sailed in the Baltic, for Liverpool, were the names of "Mr. and Mrs. Mark Sutherland, and two servants"- the latter being Oriole, who could not live without her mistress, and Mr. Sutherland's valet, who was no other than our old friend Billy Button, who had been well drilled for some years past, and now, in a speck. less suit of black, and a spotless white neckcloth, pre- sented one of the most respectable specimens of a gen- tleman's gentleman. - And in the meantime, Mr. Sutherland's elegant country seat on Lake Crystal, in one of the most hriving of the Western States, was left under the charge of that grand, impartial, large-hearted, broad- vlsioned specimen of manhood, jXr. Billy Bolling, who had received a carte-blanche for fitting up and refurnisn- ing the house; for, however uncertain any one migat be as to Mr. Bolling's opinions, no one could doubt  &#xD;<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7865-00000192"/> tWV  1lJLIA. TIM JAlAU      X on xriAU JIVasvma his taste, which was really exquisite. And that gen- tleman took the greatest possible delight in preparing the mansion for the reception of the bride. And, by the way, Mr. Bolling, by his universal agreeableness, conquered such a popularity in his own district, that he has been talked of for the Legis- lature, and would certainly have been made a candidate, only it seemed impossible by any means to arrive at' his politics, he being claimed with equal reason by all parties. Early in the winter, Mr. and My. Sutherland re- turned to the United States. They went firsts. in- vitation and pre-engagement, to spend a month among their relatives in the South. They went to Texas, where they found Mrs. Wells, still a hale and handsome woman, though o  the shady side of fifty, and the Doctor more appreclve of her real worth, and more attached to her now than he was at the period of his mercenary marriage. They spent one happy month with the Wellses, and then, accompanied by Mrs. Wells, went into Louisiana, to pay a long-pronised visit to Lincoln Lauderdale and his vivacious little lady. They found them well and prosperous, and sur- rounded by a thriving young family. Little change had time made in Lincoln or the piquant "Nan." A month was whiled away in their pleasant society, and so it was near spring before the Sutherlands, still accompanied by Mrs. Wells, set out up the river for their North-Western home. And it was quite spring when they reached the beautiful shores of Lake Crystal, and entered their   TO WED THE EARLIEST LOVED.    401 own elegant home. Mrs. Wells remained with them and spent the summer. And she still continues to come every year to spend her summers with her " beloved Mark," her "only child." Mark and India occasionally return those visits in the winter-that is, when Mr. Sutherland's official duties permit hit to do so. For Mark Sutherland is still a rising politician, adored by one party and abhorred by another. And, in the present hopeful state of-the public mind, it is impossible to predict of any given contest whether the people mean to elect or mob their own candidate. But, aside from  Mr. Sutherland's public life, his home is a very happy one. In is profession he has realized a handsome fortune. By the death of her Uncle Paul, at an advanced age, India has inherited a large property, so that they are entirely independent in their pecuniary circumstances. India is as beautiful but no longer as proud as Juno, Queen of Goddesses, and is the centre of a very refined and intellectual circle. They have two fine children--a beautiful boy, whom they named Mark-and a lovely little girl, whom they called India. Mrs. Sutherland, in a mood of magnanimity, pro- posed that this'child should be christened Rosalie; but Mr. Sutherland could by no means be brought to consent to that. No! the child must have-its mother's name-only hers. And so she had.   India was flat- tered and pleased. And Mark Sutherland was exactly right. Was Rosalie then forgotten? No nol and a thousand times nol   She was well remembered.   Her name was a sacred, sacred name, 25  &#xD;<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7865-00000193"/> 402  INDIA.

I was hers and hers only; it represented her indivi- duality; it stood to him for all that was most. beautiful, pure, lovely and sweet-aye, heavenly I He could not bear to rbestow it upon India's child, passionately as he loved that child and its mother. Reader, do you understand that? India had once been his boyhood's passion, as she was now his manhood's love. --He pre- ferred her immeasurably before all living women. She was a handsome, intellectual, and warm-hearted woman, eminently fitted to make a man like Mark Sutherland haUppy. And his marriage with her was eminently tappy. The beautiful India was his Hertha, but there was ne who had gone before who was and is his Psyche, And deep in his heart is a chamber into which no mortal creature entereth-a sanctuary closely veiled irom all human knowledge--a holy of holies, sacred to one earthly memory and one heavenly hope- sownsecrated to the veiled worship of his angel wife- ROSALIE.   &#xD;</p>
