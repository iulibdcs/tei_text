American writers, who are considered the best authority on the subject, generally concur in the opinion, we believe, that  the North American continent has been peopled, at different periods, by three distinct races of the Red Men, who, issuing, apparently, from some remote point in the North-east, spread themselves over the temperate regions of the present territory- of the United States, formed populous and powerful nations, and then, after unknown intervals of time, passed successively away towards the tropical climes of Mexico and   Central America. Of the first of these three races--the time of its coming, the length of its continuance here and its departure, scarce a shadow of tradition is now anywhere to be found. The pall of oblivion has closed over them, and they can have no place in the history of the human race. -But the existence of such a race here, at some remote period, is abundantly proved by the memorials or monuments which it has left behind and which unmistakably mark it as a peculiar race, and entirely distinct from the one that, after a time, succeeded. These memori- als or relies, have been excavated from considerable depths beneath the surface of the earth in various parts of the valley of the Mississippi, where all these different races of the Abor- igines appear to have centered. But the most remarkable specimens of this kind were brought to light in the State of  &#xD;<pb n="x-xi" xml:id="VAC8035-00000004"/> X     .      PREFACE. Kentucky, in excavating the earth for the Louisville canal. Here, nineteen feet below the surface, were discovered regu- larly moulded bricks, laid in domestic hearths, on which were found the coals of the last fires that had been kindled on them. Cooking utensils of metal and stone, well wrought specimens of pottery, copper tools, medals, silver swords, and even some implements of iron were also discovered in the same vicinity; while palpable traces of walls of systematic stone masonry, and wells that had 'been as systematically stoned up, added still further to the wonder of the discovery. From all these it is to be inferred that this early, and probably pioneer race in this coun- try, had become far advanced in the arts of civilized life. But at what period this semi-eivilized, and perhaps more than semi- civilized race, flourished here, how long they remained, what led to their voluntary or compulsory departure and whither they went, is now, as already intimated, only a matter of specu- lation. It is probable, however, that coming from the eastern part of Asia, like the two succeeding races, they found their way into the rich valley of the Mississippi considerably more than a thousand years ago; and, after flourishing there many centuries made a gradual exodus to the South, and became the Toltec nation, which is known to have preceded the Mexicans, and which is believed to have fulfilled their destiny in Central America, having been the builders of those wondrous fabrics, whose ruins have recently been brought to light by Stephens* and others. The second race of the Red Men that made thaeir appearance in that great highway of succeeding nations, evidently became established there at a much later period. And for that reason, and on account of the different national customs and peculiar characteristics, have left behind them far more palpable and general traces of their existence. There can be little doubt but this race were the mound builders; and that to them are to be attributed those innumerable earth-works or mounds which   I               ?K PREFACE.           xi have been found scattered through the valley of the Mississippi, from the great lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. The greatest pro- portion of these mounds however are found   between the southern borders of those lakes and the Ohio river. But they are found, at intervals, on both sides of the Mississippi to its mouth, and even beyond, along the Gulf of Mexico to the city of Mexico itself, thus constituting a sort of connected chain by which the sojourn and passage south of the race in question to the valley of Anahuac can, with a great degree of certainty, be traced.  From this, were there no other evidence in the case, would arise the natural conclusion that this race were no other than the Aztecs, the -subsequent founders of the old Mexican Empire, which reached the zenith of its greatness and glory under Montezuma, and   fell with that unfortunate monarch. But there is other evidence to confirm the theory that this race were the Aztecs, or the originals of the ancient Mexicans. All the traditions of the  old Mexicans concur, with wonderful unanimity, in declaring that their people once resided far to the North, where they were a strong and flourishing people - that they inhabited the pleasant land which they called Azatlan, from which they were finally driven by a  stronger people issuing from some  place still farther north-that they left Azatlan about the year 1160, and after various delays and intermediate sojourns, occupying between one and' two hundred years, they at length entered the valley of Anahuac, when soon finding, on a rock in a lake, the "Eagle on the prickly pear," to which they had been prophetically pointed as indicating the spot for the foundation of their future capital, they assembled among the marshes, and built the town which eventually be- came the proud city of Mexico, whose civilization, wealth and splendor, as brought to light by the bloody conquest of Cortez, so amazed the old world. The next question to be discussed in connection with our tale, is whereabouts in the North was this land of Azatlan  &#xD;<pb n="xii-13" xml:id="VAC8035-00000005"/> xii          PREFACE. situated'? As before stated, the greatest proportion of the ancient mounds or earthworks are found in the upper portion of the valley of the Mississippi, between Lake Superior and the Ohio. They are mainly found on the east of the Missis- sippi, and, at first, extend but a few hundred miles to the east- ward, but gradually expand, in going southward, so as to be- come based on nearly the whole length of the Ohio river. But though scattered over this whole extent, yet nowhere, perhaps, are their traces so palpably marked as in the valley of the Ouisconsin, or the present Wisconsin river, which seems to have been the great central line of these wondrous relics of the mysterious past. For these reasons, there is every probability that the heart of the ancient Azatlan was the valley of the Wisconsin, though its borders might have extended far to the west, east and south of that river. The theory involved in our tale, therefore, is, that the Aztecs, were originally the inhabitants of the Mississippi valley - that they were the mound builders, and that the seat of their em- pire, their ancient Azatlan, centered in, and around the valley of the Wisconsin river. And hence the scene of our tale is laid in one of the lower portions of that valley. Of the third race of the three first enumerated, as our tale will have nothing especially to do iwith them, it will be sufficient to remark, that they are held to be the Indians found here on the advent of the white men, and still scattered in remnants through the Western territories of the United States.    i CENTEOLA; OR THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS. CHAPTER I. I dip deep into the shadowy past. I write of an age, since which the suns of seven hundred summers have wheeled over the broad and beautiful prairies of the West. I narrate the events of an era in the primitive history of that prolific garden of the continent, which was marked,. by the compulsory exodus of one,of the different great races of the Red Men, who have there lived, fulfilled the periods of their respective destinies, and successively passed away before the influx of the ruder and stronger peoples of the North, each appearing and disappearing in turn waves in the ocean of Time. At the northerly extremity  of a  romantic valley, lying along the banks of a  noble river, and situated then, as now, about midway between the most south-westerly of the great lakes and the great river of the West, there sat on a mossy bank, on the day and hour chosen for the  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8035-00000006"/> "        CENTEOLA; OR, opening of our tale, an aged son of the forest, the sage and seer of his tribe, gazing out wistfully over the broad expanse stretching away as far as the eye could reach before him. It was a bright mid-summer morn- ing. A  wide sea of waving verdure everywhere over- spread the flowery prairie. The long chain of encircling hills, as clothed with its deepest tinted forest foliage; while beneath coursed the glittering rivers, like cords of silver thrown, around the valley to mark it off from the bold mountain margin, which everywhere en- closed it. Prairie, grove and hill-side, were all vocal with the varied music of the myriad birds, that were gaily disporting within and around them, and waking their solitudes to seeming mirth and- melody, and all nature appeared to be rejoicing in the perfection of her young life and beauty. But the Sage heeded none of these. His troubled thoughts were engrossed by the portents of the times connected with the destinies of his nation, which embraced the seven confederate tribes of the noted Azatlan and its proud capital, called the Imperial City; while ever and anon he sent searching glances over the prairie, expect- ant of the appearance of one who had become the light and hope of his life, and who would, he believed, if any one could still prove so, become the saviour of her country. While thus musing his attention was arrested by the sound of approaching footsteps, and turning, he beheld   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       15 a richly dressed young warrior standing reverently before him. "Venerated Sage," meekly said the young warrior in reply to the enquiring looks of the other, although "I have crossed your path unwittingly, I can scarcely say I regret it, for I find myself in the presence of one who can impart lessons of wisdom  to all, who, like my- self, would gladly receive them." "Thou  hast seen and heard of me, then?" slowly responded the old man, fixing a scrutinizing look on the face of the handsome young warrior. "Ay, and where shall we find one who has not heard of the good Alcoan, the Sage and Seer of the Feathered Serpents, the wisest of the seven tribes that do fealty to- the king of the Imperial City?" "By that token, young warrior, and the knowledge that I am  now in the vicinity of the place thou hast named, as well as by thine outward equipment, I judge thee to be from thence." "The Sage has judged rightly, I  am  from the great city." "Thou mayest, then, be the son of a noble - perchance of a  chief?"  "Again hast thou conjectured correctly, Sage. I am the son of a chief. My name is Tulozin, and I am the only heir to the chiefdom of my tribe." "Of the chiefdom of what tribe dost thou speak? '  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8035-00000007"/> 16         CENTEOLAi OR, "That of the warlike tribe of the Buffalos, whose broad lands and hunting grounds, as Alcoan well knows, extend from the great river on the west, till they meet the lands of the Feathered Serpents on'the East." "Ay, and it is a tribe of which thou needest not be ashamed, young Chief. But what doest thou in the Im- perial City?" "Not much at present; but Alcoan knows that the chiefs of the seven tribes and a select number of their' ti' nobles, are required to reside mainly in the Imperial City to make up the Court and Council of the King. My father's head has become white with the frosts of years. He begins to sigh for the tranquility of his old lodge among the quiet retreats of his trusty and loving people, and he lately sent for me, that, before he retires, I may receive his instructions touching the duties of the high post "of honor at Court whichl he is now soon to vacate in my favor." ("I see, young chief, I see. The objects of thy ambi- tion for place and power are about to be realized; and in the realization, thou doubtless countest on a bright career of honor and happiness. So ever calculate the ardent and aspiring young. They see only brightness in their path, and that brightness is to last forever. It may be that their visions of pleasure and power will all be fulfilled. But hast thou not heard of the black cloud that is rising in the northS"   J   "THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.              17 "I have; and I know also the uneasiness it is creating among the people and rulers of the Imperial City. But still it creates no serious alarm, and why should it, good Alcoan? Thou doubtless rememberest how ten summers ago, a similar cloud of war appeared in the same direction, how greatly were the people alarmed, and how the King and Council promptly ordered not only their own city to be fortified, but that all the confederate tribes should pro- vide against the commonsdanger by raising strong defen- sive works in the form and fashion of the Totemic em- blems of their respective tribes, and how all, this was accordingly done, the Buffalos fashioning the defensive works around their village in the form of a buffalo - the Panthers theirs in the shape of a panther, the Feathered Serpents in the shape of a -coiled serpent, and thus through all the seven tribes. And thou also rememberest, Sage, how then that threatening war cloud suddenly ceased rolling towards us." "I remember it all, Tulozin." "And are not all those defensive works still existing, and even made stronger than before by recent repairs?" "It may be so, young chief" "And again, O Sage, are not our people stronger now than theirs?" "In some respects, perhaps; but in the meanwhile have not the countless horde of our barbarian foes probably grown stronger in all respects? At their former show of I  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8035-00000008"/> 18   -      CENTO'IOLA: OR, invasion, they had evidently just arrived in the vicinity of the great lake of the -North from some cold and sterile region far beyond. They were then doubfless sadly way- worn, and without the food and equipments necessary for offensive campaigns; and they paused and spread them- selves out over that land which divides the rivers running North, from those running South, to supply their wants, and gather strength for the onward march for the milder regions hereabouts, at which they were aiming. And that needed strength they have doubtless gathered in the ten years interval which has since elapsed. So at last they must believe; for they are again concentrated, and in motion towards us, having already nearly reached, it is said, the borders of our fair and fertile domains, which they are- intent on seizing. Yes, Tulozin, they are moving down upon us with the stern resolve of our subju- gation, and with a- prospect of success which may well make us tremble for the result." ' The infirmities of age, good Alcoan, may have made you timid and prone to magnify the danger. Even if it be as you say about the determination of the foe to invade us, we are prepared for the onset. All the tribes have their sufficient defenses; while the Imperial City has been doubly fortified. And besides all this, ever since the for- mer menaced advance of the enemy, the King and Coun- cil have been propitiating the god of war, the great Mexitlo, by the yearly sacrifice of a virgin to his honor; /                      a    THE MAID OP THE MOUNDS.       19 and now to make doubly sure of the favor of the god at this crisis, and present him an offering which shall .be adequate to his greatest possible requirements, it is pro- posed, at the sacred festival, which as you may be aware, is to be held in his name to-morrow and next day, to sacri- fice to him a whole score of the fairest virgins of the land." "Ah, Tulozin, blinded Tulozin! In the strength on which thou thus countest for the Imperial City, will lie, according to my light, its greatest weakness and danger. There is but one God who has any control over the affairs and destinies of men.  He created all--governs all. He is the only true and Supreme God; and if there be any such bloody gods as thou hast named, they have no power to hurt or-helpl us, for they are all subject to his will. He is also a just God, prospering or punishing men and nations according to their deserts, and He, too, is a good God and cannot but be offended by the sacrifice of any of his earthly children, all of whom are the objects of his love, his care and protection." "Alcoan, I know, is a wise man, and among the Seers of the land; but he does not talk like the Seers of the Imperial City, with whom till now, I had supposed he agreed. Has he seen and consulted with any of them?" "( Ay, young chief, I have. Not many moons ago, a' deputation of their number, or of higher officials, it may be, acting for and with them, came to his lodge at the vil-  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8035-00000009"/> 20        . CENTEOLA; OR,  lage of thoe Feathered Serpents, on the banks of your beautiful river, where it begins to turn to the west. After disclosing their own views, they demanded his. He gave them. But they would'heed none of his words of truth and warning; and they turned scornfully away from his auguries. Much less would they listen to those of one to whom he referred them- of her whose light, com- pared with his, is as the light of the sun to the torch of the night-hunters." "Who is that of whom thou so highly speakest, good Alcoan?" "It is Centeola  the young, the beautiful and the greatly gifted." "Is she not thy daughter; O Sage?" "Only in the spirit, young chief." "What then is her lineage? One so gifted as thou claim- est her every way to be, should surely be-of noble blood." "She is more than that ; but of her lineage I may not speak. I may have some Knowledge oq the subject, but the time has not yet arrived for disclosing the secret, though it may not now be far distant." "Is she not an inmate of thy lodge'?" "It is even so."  "And has she not always been with thee?" "Nay - many years, but not always." "Whence came she, then? ' "Thou pressest me .-more closely in this matter, young   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       i21 chief, than I am wont tp permit. But I may properly tell thee, perhaps, which many others of my tribe know, that she was left at the door of my lodge, when she was too young to know whence she came, or of whom she- was the offspring." "But hadst thou not thyself means of forming a conjec- ture respecting her origin?" "Yea, young chief, I soon believed I had. Though the child's outer garment was a coarse one, put on, doubt- less as a disguise, yet her inner garments were of fine and peculiar texture, which I thought significant of the char- acter of her parentage.  This alone, however, was not conclusive, but I soon discovered an article which gave me a direct clue to the mystery. It was a small silver amulet, marked with a particular device, which being sus- pended from her neck beneath all her clothing, had not, through some inadvertence probably, been removed. This clue I followed up till I had discovered all; but I locked up the secret in the deepest recesses of my bosom, for I   believed that to. be the  better wisdom, and the better course for the welfare of the child. I knew she was a  castaway, for whom no one had a thought except to get rid of her. But my philosophy taught me that the good  Providence who must condemn, while it, for wise purposes, permitted  the wrongs she had unconsciously suffered, would bless the lodge where she  was kindly received. I  therefore took  her in  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8035-00000010"/> 22         CENTEOLA; OR, and cared for all her wants., Nor was I mistaken in the result. She had come- to me as a white-winged dove, bringing peace and blessings to my lodge. Every thing began to prosper with me as never before. I knew the cause, and was anxious for the continuance of the blessings, and the happiness which the performance of this duty brought me. I redoubled my efforts for the welfare and improvement of the beautiful child." "And did she improve so as to reward all thy exer- tions, good Alcorgn?" "She did, as thou shalt hear, Tulozin. I had ever been a worshiper of intellect. And why should I not be; for it is, when not perverted by passion a part of God himself. And thus- regarding this spark of divinity within us, what won- der that I should delight to see it developed in one who had become so dear to me. Having early perceived in her the marks of an extraordinary mind, I resolved to go on pol- ishing the gem assiduously and unremittingly, to see to 'what degree of brilliancy it might be made to attain. I therefore trained her mind with the most anxious care, im- parting, as fast as she could be made to receive and compre- hend it, all the learning of which I myself was master, and then toiled seeking out new treasures of knowledge that I might add still further to the wondrous progress she was so obviously making. And by the time she began to approach the confines of womanhood, I found myself com- muning with one, who, as I was daily made conscious, had   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       23 become my full equal in intelligence and powers of mind. Then when she had grasped all the knowledge which men are generally permitted to possess, she began to soar still higher and pierce into the mystic future. And it was then, also, that a great marvel began to appear in the mind-power of each of us. In proportion as her light in- creased in strength and brightness, mine seemed to dimin- ish and gradually to withdraw- itself from the events of the future into the limits of the present and past; so that now, as regards us two, she has become the- Seer and I only the Sage." "Your words fill me with wonder and admiration. But is it indeed true that Alcoan, whose fame for augu- ries is known throughout all Azatlan, can no longer claim to be among-the Seers of the land?" "No longer, young chief; his light is absorbed in the brighter one." "I will then ask of him as a, Sage what I had thought to ask of him as a Seer - has he any fears that our proud and populous Azatlan can ever be overrun and conquered by the hostile horde now threatening us at the North?" "He has such fears, Tulozin." "Wherefore can such fears arise? Alcoan cannot rea- son from anything that can now be discerned by others." "That may partly be so, young chief. But Alcoan has ,deeply studied ithe general course of human' events, and seen what constitutes the strength, and what the weak-  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8035-00000011"/> 24         u S1NTIOLA; OR, ness of a nation. Nations, like individual men, have their youth, their manhood, their age, and their death or dispersion. One after another, in the long course of time, they appear in some goodly land, like this of ours, grow strong and flourish, till, at length becoming weak or wick- ed, they fade away and give place to some stronger race. They are born and grow hardy in the North, to prepare them for brighter and perhaps stouter careers in the mild- er regions. They appear always to come from the North and move towards the South, and never in the contrary directions. And thus, in their different periods, they suc- cessively sweep over the land, like the billows that chase each other over the great lakes of the North. We know by tokens we find in the earth, as well as from the tradi- tions of our fathers, that in early times -the times be- ginning, perhaps, soon after Azatlan rose from the broad waste of waters once extending from our great lake at the North to the great sea at the South-we know that a great nation lived here in the land now occupied by us, fulfilled its period and disappeared. Our nation is here now, but is it destined long to remain so? The history of the past bids me to say no! The condition of our over-ripe nation says no; and finally the portents of the times all echo back the answer, no! Are not these things so, Tulozin? Is not the black storm-cloud already throw- ing its portentous shadow across our borders in its apsl proach-? And when was such a cloud ever turned back in its course?" b.   THE MAID OF- THE MOUNDS.      25 '"Sage, Iam sorely perplexed by your strange and bod- ing discourse. But surely our nation cannot come within your meaning. Its destiny cannot yet be fulfilled. It should be still in the strength of the middle age." "Ay, should be, but is not. .If the head of a middle aged man becomes diseased, will his body and limbs re- main healthy and strong, or will they become weak and paralyzed?" "I know not that I understand thee, Sage. The head of our nation is the Imperial City; does the Sage deem that to be diseased?" ,' Young chief, I might well say more, but thou art not prepared to hear it now. Be content with what I have spoken, and ponder it well." "For thy own opinions, then, Sage, I will not now fur- ther press thee. But thou mayst, perhaps, give me those of another. I would know what is reflected from that bright light of which you have so warmly spoken.  I would know more of the fair and gifted Centeola. Thou wast expecting to meet her here about this time, it may be?" "And, may be, so wast thou, young chief." (' Sage, thou hast read me closely." "Confess thyself freely then. Tell me why thou hast enquired of me so particularly concerning her, and what were thy reasons for supposing her to be on her way hither?"

But as I have pressed thee to tell me more, perchance, than I had just right to require of thee, I cannot now, it may be, well refuse to respond to thy questions. I will therefore tell thee frankly." "It were better for thee to do so, young chief." "The Sage, doubtless, knows how to make allowances for the errors of youth, if in me such errors be found. Let him hear me then forbearingly; forgive, if he cannot approve, and he shall be told the truth, though it may de- mean me in his sight." '"Alcoan never judges harshy of a. man, when he per- ceives that truth and sincerity are at the bottom of his heart., "Iproceed then, Sage. About twelve moons ago, while living-with my tribe, the spirit of adventure was strong upon -me. It took various shapes, but of one only have I need to speak. The fame of the great beauty of Cente- ola, the marvellous maid of the Feathered Serpents, had reached me; and I at length resolved to go to her village, that with my own eyes I might judge of one whose name had been on so many tongues. And disguised as a poor vender of female ornaments, I travelled. to your favored village, and called at the door of thy lodge, saw and had slight speech with thee. But learning from thee that the one I thought must be her whom I sought, was out with her maiden companions in the borders of a neighbor-   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       27 ing forest, I proceeded thither. On entering the forest, I soon" came upon a merry group of maidens, -some gath- ering wild flowers, some warbling in chorus with the featl- ered songsters, and some trying to snare small birds of rich plumage for their feathered embroidery. They were all beautiful; but one of them was of such surpassing loveliness and womanly dignity, that I became as one sud- denly transfixed in speechless admiration before some bright vision. I knew it was Centeola; for her maiden companions, gathering round her as if for protection, call- ed'her so. She cast on me a look of mingled rebuke and inquiry. But such was my confusion that I forgot all about the excuse of offering my wares, could make no ex- planation or apology for my intrusion, and retired abashed from her presence, at once setting out on my return to my tribe, but carrying with me the deeply impressed -image of her whose appearance had so overpowered my senses. Such, Sage, is my confession, and in it thou wilt read the interest I have ever since felt in Centeola and the reason why I have inquired about her so particularly. I have disclosed this with much misgiving, and hardly hope for thy approbation. But I may at least claim the merit of having spoken the words of truth and frankness." "That much is certainly thine, young ohief. 'Tis not often that youth can be brought to expose their follies so frankly. But my other question -how thou camest to expect Centeola here, at this time, remains yet unanswer- ed;"  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8035-00000013"/> 28         CENTEOLA; OR, "What I have already told thee, Sage, was my own se- cret to disclose or withhold, as I chose. But what thou now askest may perhaps involve some of the secrets of the council, to which I am beginning to have access, but of which I am not permitted to speak. And as I cannot promise the same frankness in answering this as in an- swering thy other questions, perhaps thou wilt be content with the statement that our rulers have many means of knowing what is passing among the tribes, which is not generally understood. "Thou admittest then, that those rulers have their secret emissaries among the people?" "They do not call them so, Sage. They consider them as men sent out to see and report the condition of the nation." "And was it from these that thy knowledge of Centeo- la's approach to the Imperial City, to-day, was obtained?" "Tulozin cannot deny it." "What then did they believe to be the object of her coming?" "To be present at the coming festival, they supposed; and it appeared to gratify them, that so famed a beauty was about to grace the ceremonies with her presence." "If they suppose Centeola comes to minister to the law- less gaze of the young nobles,'or even the less questiona- ble curiosity of the gaping multitude, they reason without knowledge. Centeola comes on a higher mission."   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       29 "What may that mission be, good Alcoan?" "I may not tell thee, young chief." "Not if I might aid her in her purposes?" "Nay, nay, young chief. And even were I at liberty to disclose to thee her objects, the disclosure would be more likely to displease than gratify thee." "I cannot fathom thy words, O Sager Centeola is as pure and good as she is beautiful, and she cannot be en- gaged in aught which is not right; and with what is right to be done, Tulozin can never be displeased. I have proved to thee, Sage, I think, how great is my regard and reverence for her, and you can readily believe from all my words and actions, how much I should be gratified to win her favor." "I understand thee, young chief, but cannot encourage thee. With thy present views and feelings in all the mat- ters which are now most engrossing our care and anxiety, and with the approbation thou hast shown of measures which our rulers propose for averting the calamities now threatening the country, there is a wall between thee and Centeola as long as Earth and as high as- Heaven.

Look at the shadows," returned the Sage. "Thine eyes are clearer than mine. Watch them closely, a mo- ment, to see whether they are still shortening, or pausing before they turn to the lengthening?" The young chief did so, and soon reported that the shade of the tree he had been inspecting was stationary. "The time has arrived, then," said the Sage. ' Cen- teola was to be here when the shadows were the shortest. So now send thy gaze along over the mid line of the prai- rie, and tell me what thou seest?" "I see," said the young chief, after a long and search- ing gaze in the indicated direction-"I see quite a num- ber of moving specks, far out on the prairie. Ay, and they are coming this way. They move like a band of travellers." "Ah! it is doubtless Centeola and her train," ex- claimed the sage with an air of animation, rising and advancing to obtain a view for himself.   THE MAID OF T   E MOUNDS a     81 CHAPTER II. "She loves but knows not whom she loves." Let us here revert to such incidents of previous occurrent. connected with the later career of the remarkable maiden, whom we have indirectly brought to the knowledge of the reader, as shall serve more fully to introduce her to him, and explain all that is necessary to be known for a clear understanding of what is to follow. The sage Alcoan at first loved his adopted child, the beauteous Centeola, for her docile and gentle nature, - then admired her for her extraordinary powers of intel- lect, and finally suffered his admiration to rise to a feel- ing of profound reverence from his belief in her super- added gifts of prophecy. And in his high estimate of her mental powers, at least he did her but the simplest jus- tice. Her mind flashed like light over every subject pre- sented for its contemplation, and intuitively detecting and rejecting all the false in every view, rested only on the true in forming its conclusions. And all the more uner- ring were those conclusions, because they were reached by the aiding light of a high moral nature.   Pure  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8035-00000015"/> 82         CENTEOLA; OR, intellect alone is not always a safe guide, especially in matters involving moral principle. It needs the correct- ive influence of that inner light which is called conscience, ' and which has ever been found planted in'the human soul, since the Creator recognized it at the fall of our first progenitors, by asking them,- Who told thee thou wert naked?  That inner light and acute moral sense, was possessed to an unusual extent by Centeola. And while instinctively shrinkingfrom all that was impure, and re- volting from every form of wickedness and wrong, she was thus enabled clearly to read all the principles of im- mutable justice, and foresee what consequences must ne- cessarily be visited on all flagrant violations of those prin- ciples by the Great and Good Spirit whom she adored: and what consequently to her nation must be the result of the vices and sins which prevailed among the people at large, and especially of the wickedness and idolatries that predominated in the Imperial City, the fountain head of every corruption and wrong. And hence she began, as if acting under some involuntary impulse, to predict, unless timely repentance and reformation might avert it, the ap- proaching doom of the nation, in its destruction by some signal judgment of Heaven, or in its expulsion from the beloved Azatlan, where it had risen to such prosperity and power.  Alcoan, therefore, believed her a super- naturally inspired prophetess. But she did not deem her- self so. She was Conscious of the exercise only of the   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.        33 higher gifts of the natural mind; for her predictions were founded on what she deemed to be the logic of events. Such was the degree of intellectual and moral progress to which Centeola had attained, and such the position in which 'she stood the year before the opening of our tale. Up to that time her life had flowed on like some clear and tranquil stream, whose waters no rude winds had ever been permitted to ruffle. Her employments were mostly of an intellectual character, varying from the closest exer- cises of the mind, to the lighter contemplation of the beau- ties and harmonies of nature. Of the cares of life she knew nothing; for she had been brought up as one-of the daughters of the nobles; and the passions which usually agitate her sex in early womanhood as yet slumbered un- disturbed in her guileless bosom. This halcyon period of her life, however, was now about to be brought to a close. Events were at hand, which were to teach her that she was a woman, and that from woman's feelings, and wo- man's peculiar trials, she was no longer to be exempted. It was about this time occurred the forest scene be- tween the young chief Tulozin and Centeola and-her eom- panions, which has* been described in the preceding chap- ter as making a deep impression on him, and which, not- withstanding his misgivings about the effect of his intru- sion, was destined, it would seem, to produce a scarcely less deep impression on her than it had on him.

The summons being soon obeyed, the two fair friends, hand in hand, took their way out of the village and along down the banks of the majestic river which on one side encompassed it. After proceeding some distance in silence, they came opposite to a deeply wooded island, lying but a little way out in the stream; when Centeola hesitatingly paused and said - "I would, Mitla, that we were in the deepest recesses of yon beautiful island, where the pensive silence of the shaded forest might better harmonize with my feelings, at this time, than this open field and dazzling sunshine, and also better comport, it may be, with the character of the subject on which I would commune with thee." ',' Thy wish can easily be gratified, Centeola," return- ed the other. "' We have just passed by a canoe moored to the bank of the stream; and I will return and row it down to this place; where we will both embark for the island."' Receiving a nod of approbation of her suggestion, the attentive Milta departed on the proposed errand, and in a few moments more, she appeared with the promised canoe; when, having taken in her revered friend, she, with a few   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.        35 dexterous strokes of the springy oars, sent. the light craft to the opposite shore. Both here disembarking, they leis- urely proceeded through the thickly embowering forest some distance into the interior of the island; when, at a gesture from Centeola, they seated themselves on a flowery bank, which was diffusing its delicate perfume over all around them. It was a beautiful spot, and one that might well be consecrated as sacred to solitude. The obstructed rays of the summer sun broke softly down through the small wavy openings among the breeze-moved foliage above to the variegated carpet of flowers beneath, and well was the scene graced by the two lovely maidens who now occupied it. They both were favored with an unusual share of personal beauty; but the types of their beauty were as diverse as were their characters. That of the pecu- liarly intellectual Centeola, with a form in every line, and a face in every lineament, as fair and faultless as that claimed for Eve in Paradise, was singularly angelic and etherial; while that -of Mitla, the elder and more practi- cal, was, like her character, of a less poetical, and more earthy cast.               ' On a slender branch of a neighboring tree, and in full view of the maidens, sat a solitary turtle dove, sending. forth, ever and anon, its liquid notes of mournful melody. "List Mitla " 'said Centeola, after pensively musing awhile in silence, "list to yon beautiful bird! How soft and tender its varied notes, and how sweet their low and melting cadences!                -  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8035-00000017"/> 36-        CENTEOLA; OR, ", I both see and hear it,'. responded the other; ':but the sight and sound of that kind of bird is too familiar to me to cause any particular emotion." "So it might have been with me, at another time, Mitla. But to-day those notes of charming sadness seem somehow to touch a chord in my bosom which, I feel sure, was never thus touched before." "Why is that so, Centeola? :' "I scarcely know, myself, Mitla. Something unusual must havehappened to me, or some mysterious change come over me ; for I feel as if I was being dragged down from the bright realms of the intellectual world, where I have so long reveled, to the grosser things of earth and sense. Can I have committed some great sin, Mitla that this should be so?" "Nay, Centeola is too intelligent to have done that un- knowingly, and too good to have done it knowingly." "Then, I will ask thee, Mitla, whether thou believest one can commit a sin in a dream?" "Nay---certainly not, dear Centeola; but why askest thee that singular question?" "I must tell thee, Mitla. The scene that occurred yes- !terday in the forest, wlhen the young stranger so unex- pectedly appeared, and so silently departed, must be fresh in thy memory?" "It is so." "And thou didst not fail to note how noble his mein and how bright and kindly his countenance?"   I;"        THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       37 "I did note his looks, Centeola, and thought them to be in some measure what thou hast said of them. But otherwise there was nothing very attractive about him. His apparel was certainly of the commonest kind." I scarcely noticed his apparel at all, Mitla. It was his manly and handsome features, and the fine, intelligent expression that illumined them. that engrossed my atten- tion. And if these, as thou sayest, were noticed by thee, how much more should they be by me, on whom his gaze was so closely riveted, and on whom, to- the last, I felt his looks to be wistfully lingering." "It was thy shining beauty, Centeola, that caused him thus to single thee out. It is so with all men. But what of the dream at which thou hinted?" "I did have a dream, last night, Mitla- a dream of different aspects but all of similar import. I fell asleep, thinking, with feelings of lively interest and curiosity of the stranger we had encountered. And it was not long before I thought he stood before me, in the same forest where I saw him and under the same circumstances. At first, it was the exact scene of yesterday acted over again; but not as yesterday did he mutely depart. He beckoned me aside, and in gentle and respectful tones, apologized for his intrusion, and expressing a hope of seeing me again, bestowed on me a winning smile and departed, leav- ing me with a new and strange feeling at work in my bo- som.  An interval of time seemed to elapse, and then  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8035-00000018"/> 38    -     CENTEOLA; OR, there was a change in the scene. I was walking along the flowery banks of a beautiful river; when he, the stranger of the former scene, fell in by my side, took my hand, which I seemed to have no power to withhold, and said to me something - I knew not what, but felt it was that which made me very, very happy. This scene also soon faded away, and another but briefer interval elapsed, after which I seemed to be surrounded by new and fright- ful objects, with strange, fearful sounds, and the wild commotion of angry multitudes, who were fast closing up everywhere around me for my destruction; when sudden- ly a deliverer appeared in the person of -the same youngr stranger, but now clothed in the rich garb of a plumed chief, who snatched me from the impending danger and bore me off in triumph - a triumph which I felt to be -nore mine than his, and wkich sent such a thrill of joy and gratitude through my heart, that the sensation in- stantly awoke me." "It was surely a strange dream- at least a strange one for Centeola to dream," observed Mitla thoughtfully, but without manifesting much surprise. "It was so," responded Centeola with an air of innocent perplexity; " and I would know, Mitla, the interpretation thereof; for it is that, I suppose that makes me feel so different to-day and so fills my bosom with that half pleas- ing, half painful sadness, to which the plaintive and ten- der notes of yon pretty bird seem to give such fitting expression."   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       39 "Let that bird, then be the interpreter of thy dream, Centeola,'" said the other with a smile significant of more than she had expressed. "Of the feelings in me caused by the dream, it may be a truthful one," returned Centeola; , but not of the seeming events of that dream, nor what they foreshadow. It is of the hidden meaning of these that I would know thy opinion, good Mitla,"' "It is not for such as I arn to instruct one like Centeola in things of this kind," said Milta evasively, "I deal with the facts of the present, not those to exist hereafter. And as to the shadowy events of dreams,- which -have no real existence, I should place on them but little depen- dence." "But, as I reason, Mitla,"' persisted the other, " there can be no events pictured to us in our dreams except such as have happened, are happening, or are to happen here- after. If we believe, then, that they refer neither to the past nor present, we may look upon them as types of things to come, which are shown the mind by the great all-seeing Spirit in pid of its uncertain gropings after the truths of the future." "That," rejoined Mitla, who, believing she knew the cause of the dream in question better than the dreamer herself. seemed still disinclined to yield the point- " that may possibly sometimes be so; but generally there is a much more simple explanation of such dreams as thine;  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8035-00000019"/> 40         OENTEOLA; OR, a strong impression, like that on thee, is made -stronger dreams, like thine follow ; while impressions made by ac- tual events, and the dreams that follow them, often act and react on each other, till the one is greatly deepened and the other as greatly magnified. Thus we may be led to attach undue importance to our dreams and delude ourselves with the idea that they are prophetic of some- thing of great moment to ourselves or others, when they are only the counterparts of scenes witnessed in our waking hours, which have been reproduced and exaggerat- ated by a dreaming fancy. Thou hast sometimes seen a cloud hanging directly overhead, appearing to occupy a large space and looking formidable. One hour afterwards it has sunk away to a speck on the horizon and become a thing of contempt. So, Centeola, may prove what is now the burden of thy thoughts." Centeola now evidently for the first time seemed to comprehend herself and the character' of the feelings that were agitating her unaccustomed bosom, and, blushing deeply, she hastily rose and said, "Thou art wiser than I am, Mitla. Let us hence to the village." For many months after the occurrence of the'scene last described, Centeola passed her time in dreamy seclusion, being, for a long while, unable - perhaps unwilling, to throw off the strange, sweet spell by which she had been so unwittingly enthralled. At length, however it grad- *    ,    THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       41 ually yielded to the sway of her lofty intellect; and by the opening of another spring, it had nearly ceased to be felt or remembered, and her thoughts again became con- centrated in trying to fathom the gloom which she and her foster-father had long seen to be hanging over the future of their country, and which from her greater gifts of prophecy or more active fancy, had filled her with espe- cial bodings and apprehensions. And if such bodings were, the year before, warranted, much more so were they be- coming now. For by this time, the country became rife with the rumor that the dreaded barbarian horde, that had formerly so alarmed the nation, were again making -the most active preparations for an aggressive warfare. The Imperial City, as arrogant as it was in its fancied security, and as dead as it had become from its luxurious habits, its vices and corruptions, had now taken the alarm, and its rulers had transmitted orders to every tribe to repair all their fortresses and put themselves in the best possible state of defence. But while the attention of the nation generally was only engaged on these material de- fences, there were a large number among the best and wisest of the tribes, who believed that if the nation was doomed, it was only on account of the great wickedness of the Imperial City, and that of such of the people as had been made sharers and abbettors in that central source of corruption; and that, consequently, if the impending calamity was to be averted at all, it must be affected no  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8035-00000020"/> CENTEOLA; OR,  less by moral than physical' agencies. At the head of this influential, but hitherto silent class, confessedly stood the sage Alcoan and his supposed daughter, the wonderfully talented Centeola, both known far and wide among the tribes, one as the wisest of Sages and Seers, and the other as alike remarkable for beauty of person and growing gifts of prophecy. But before any action was taken by Alcoan and Cen- teola in futherance of their particular views, another in- cident occurred in the usual calm life of the latter, which disturbed her as painfully as the former one had, for the time pleasingly, and which, with the new insight it gave her of the aims and true characters of those in authority, was destined to quicken the movements which she and Alcoan had in contemplation for effecting the reformations that might yet, perchance, turn away the wrath of Heav- en from their offending nation. One day, as has also been intimated in the preceeding chapter, a delegation from the Imperial City, of unknown personages made their appearance, in a private, and al- most stealthy manner, at the lodge of Alcoan. They were two in number; and, though they did not disclose their names or rank, they were yet evidently high officials of some kind sent out to forward the secret schemes of the government. The elder of these, who was considerably past the mid- dle age, assumed the office of chief spokesman; but the   other and better looking of the two, but for a certain sin- ister expression about the eyes, obviously possessed the controlling mind. They claimed to have come to consult the Sage and his daughter on the auguries of the day in relation to the impending crisis. But when the opinions and predictions of the two latter had been expressed, they, instead of heeding them, sought to show them erroneous and subversive of the policy which the government at the Imperial City, with the sanction of all its Seers and Sages, had decided on pursuing. But to all this, Alcoan had, like Pilate, but one reply - "What I have spoken, I have spoken. The record of my words has already been made by the Great and Good One above, who changes not as men often change from unworthy motives; nor will he suffer men so to change with impunity." "But," persisted the others, " it is commendable in the sight of all the Gods to change from wrong to right." "Ay,"- returned the sage, "but never from right to wrong. Alcoan never speaks with a double tongue, and he shall never have to answer to a double record." Centeola, who was also plied in the same manner, after a still more brief and cold reply, remained resolutely si- lent; for, with a keener penetration, she had already per- ceived many things, besides the repugnant sentiments they had advanced, that led her to doubt the motives and char- acters of the Imperial visitants, and especially the young-  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8035-00000021"/> "        CENTEQLA ; OR, er and sinister-eyed one, from whose questionable glances she instinctively shrank as from the look of a basilisk. But the conscientious sage and his pure minded daughter were not to be suffered thus to escape. The hour of temptation for the one, and of trial for the other, was not to be spared them. - On pretence of wishing to inspect the fortress-mounds, which had been erected around this, as well as around the chief villages of all the tribes, the elder Emissary induc- ed Alcoan to go out with himi for that purpose, leaving Centeola, to her extreme dismay, alone in the lodge with the younger. The two former then proceeded to go the rounds of the works, which, for reasons before given, were erected in the shape of the full length coil of a mon- ster serpent, and made to embrace the entire village in its extended folds. These works consisted of a continuous rampart thrown up from the surrounding ditch, so as to form a perpendicularly faced wall without, about a dozen feet high, everywhere surmounted along the edge of thle counter-scarp by extremely sharp, thickly laid pickets made to project out horizontally a full half yard over thie wall. and were firmly confined down in their places by an unbroken line of ponderous beams. And these high and curiously picketed ramparts, thus enclosing the whole of the compactly built village,'with two massive wooden gates opening on different sides of the enclosure, completed this particular one of those remarkable mound-fortresses, l   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       45 the renfains of which were destined, in after ages, to be- come the puzzle and the wonder of the learned world. After viewing these works awhile, they retired to a seat under the shading boughs of a neighboring oak, when A1- coan was again beset by the attending Emissary, and strongly urged to change his opinions, and begint Jo make smoother and more acceptable predictions; and if he would do so, he was assured that any reward, any post of honor be might desire, should be his. But finding, at -length, that the Sage was not to be moved by arguments, nor tempted by bribes, the persistent Emissary was begin- ning to resort to menaces, when the conference was sud- denly cut short by an unexpected apparition. Centeola, with disordered dress, flushed brow, and a countenance eloquent with indignation, stood mute before them. The sage gazed at her a moment with a disturbed and inquir- ing look, and then hesitatingly asked, "Is it well with thee, my daughter?" "Is it not well with all who pass through fiery -trials and come out unscathed, my father?" replied Centeola. "Ay," returned the sage, his look of concern chang- ing to one of triumph, "Ay, and by that token, I may say it is well with me also. But whither now, my daugh- ter?" "To some covert," replied she, with a look of mingled detestation and resolve - " to some safe covert, where I  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8035-00000022"/> "        . CENTEOLA; OR, slall in vain be sought, till the wandering stars' have passed away to their own place, and: the village of the Feathered Serpents freed from their worse than dubious visitors."  So saying she quickly vanished from the sight; when Alcoan, turning abruptly to the Emissary, bent on him a gaze of such withering scorn and rebuke as made him quail before it. Soon mastering his feelings, however the Sage rose and said to the other, "Thy brother is alone now. I must return to my r lodge, lest he think the rights of hospitality violated by my further neglect." The Empissary also now rose, and with an abashed look left the place with the other. A silent walk of a few minutes brought them back to the lodge they had left an hour before on the proposed tour of inspection. Here they found the baffled Emissary, whom they had left with the fugitive maiden, hurriedly pacing the room with every manifestation of vexation and chagrin. The two Emissa- ries then went aside4 held a brief consultation, returned, announced their intention of departing, and, bidding the Sage a cold farewell, at once took their way out of the village. This visit of the Emissaries of the Imperial City to Alcoan and his daughter, produced on the latter effects just the opposite from what was intended and confidently *    '      .      .   ' ...

It was the means of revealing to them both, in different ways, the views, intentions and practice of their rulers, which betrayed a state of general depravity among them far more deplorable than had ever before been imagined. It was also the means of revealing to them the startling fact that human' sacrifices, the crowning abom- ination of all, were, instead of being discontinued to be largely increased. These discoveries, when added to what they before knew, filled the Sage and his daughter with fresh bodings and alarms, and soon led them to fix on a plan for giving a more practical effect to their preachings and predictions. And in pursuance of this plan, and with the additional object of absenting themselves from their village that they might be out of the reach of annoyances like those lately experienced, they privately left their home and spent the next two months in successively visi- ting all the leading tribes of the nation, acquainting them- selves with the condition -of the people and the wrongs and oppressions under which the latter were found suffer- ing. They everywhere communed with the wise and good -everywhere found strong adherents to the cause to which they had resolved to devote themselves, and every- where received assurances of sympathy and support. And the result of the extended consultation was the de- termination that a deputation should be sent to the Imper- ial City, at the head of which, it was decided, that none  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8035-00000023"/> 48         CENTEOLA; OR, were so suitable, or so likely to affect the object in view, as Alcoan and Centeola, and accordingly the two latter re- paired to their own village and made the preparations for the contemplated visit to the Imperial City, which eventu- ated in their appearance at the place, and in the .manner described in the first chapter;   THE MAID OF THE KMWTNDS.      4 CHAPTER III. We now return to the Sage and young chief standing on the spot where we left them watching the approach of Centeola and her train seen slowly advancing from the distant point in the prairie, where they first became dis- cernible. At length they' came within the distance of half a mile, where the sex and varied characters of those composing the unusual cortegJ became distinguishable to the keen eye of the young chief Who, while the Sage had fallen back into his seat, never once withdrew his excited gaze from them after he had learned who was the princi- pal personage among them. ' They have at last come so near. that I can distinctly make out their number and general appearance, good Alcoan," said the young chief in tones almost tremulous with the lively interest he felt in the- advancing party. "There are as I judge them to be by their costume, seven maidens; and these seem to be attended by double that num- ber of men, and one half of them equipped as young war- riors, preceding the maidens ; and the other half, older and unarmed men, following closely in their rear." t             v - 's  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8035-00000024"/> 5t          CENTEOLA; OR, "Thou hast noted them    well, and judged of them correctly," responded the Sage complacently.   "Centeo- la does not come unhonored, nor unsanctioned. The sev- en maidens, including herself, are the representatives of the seven tribes, as are also the young warriors and the elderly men without arms. The train is now full, as I am gratified to perceive by thy count. Two of them, accord- ing to their promise made me last nighat their village of the Panthers over the river to the east, whither I went to enlist them, and whence by the nearer route I came here this morning, have somewhere joined the company on the way." "But there is a strange appearance about one of the maidens," resumed the other with a deeply puzzled air. "She appears to be mounted on some tall- white animal. Who can she be, Alcoan; and what is the animal that seems to carry her so gracefully?" "That is Centeola," replied the Sage proudly; " and the beautiful animal she rides is the horse."-* *-The horse is here introduced under the conviction that he was one of the indigenous animals of America, and, until a short period before the date of our tale, plentifully spread over the prairies of the West, that conviction being founded on the indubitable evidence of the bones of the animal found among the fossil remains of the country. The Spanish invaders of Mexico, it is true, found no horses in the regions they traversed, and hence concluded that there never had been any on this continent, and subsequent travellers falling in with that notion, have generally set it down as a fact that the immense herds of wild horses found in the savannas of the South-west, all sprung from the   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.         51 "The horse?  Ay, that is the name -the horse," re- joined the wondering young warrior," I now mind me I have heard the old men say, that in the days of their fa- thers, there were in their country many of those animals, which roamed the prairies at will, but which were often caught, tamed, and made to bear on their backs hunters and warriors, with the swifteness of the wind in the chase, or on the war-path.  But I thought they had all passed away, and were no longer known in the land." "They have," responded the Sage sadly, "they have indeed, all passed away, melancholy types, it may be, of the fate which awaits our once prosperous and powerful people,  ay, all passed away, leaving as far as I know, but one, specimen remaining in the whole land.   In my early boyhood there were a few still left; in the boyhood of my father, they were as plentiful as the deer- and buf- falo that now inhabit our forests and prairies. But they were mysteriously smitten by some fatal disease, which, spreading far and wi(e among them, swept them, in a few horses imported by the Spaniards. But that they should have so multi- plied from that source, in so brief a. period, and spread themselves even to Oregon, as they did, over mountain ranges that horses would never have climbed, may well admit of a serious doubt. It is far more prothu- ble that the whole valley of the Missisippi was, at one period well stocked with wild horses, but that they became in that region, at last, wholly ex- tinct from the ravages of some general pestilence breaking out among them.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8035-00000025"/> 52        - CENTEOLA; OR, years all away but one, which was, at, first saved from per- ishing by me, and then, as I have always thought, pre- served by the special care and favor of the Great Spirit." "How was that, Sage? ' asked the other, with the air of awakened curiosity." "I will tell thee, young chief,!' answered the Sage. "When Centeola was a small girl, I made a journey to a distant forest, where one day I suddenly came upon a very young foal, standing over its prostrate and evidently dying dam; I could not but be touched by the distress of the bereaved little creature as its parent gave the last gasp ;, straightened out and died. I therefore gently approached, laid my hand on its back, and soon brought it to submit willingly to, my caresses. I then put a thong around its neck, and after many trials, so reduced it to subjection that I led it home with me, nourishing it on the way with the milk of the bruised ears of the green maize, which it quickly learned to suck as eagerly as it would have done the teats of the mother. When I reached my lodge I gave it to my- little darling, Centeola, who, with eager de- light, took it at once in hand, made it her pet and com- panion, trained it at last to bear her proudly on its back; and thus she reared it to maturity, and all without show- ing the least sign of the fatal disease by which the rest of its kind had perished; for what Centeola- loves the Great -Spirit seems also always to love and preserve." The spot now occupied by the Sage and young chief   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       58 was, as may have been before inferred, on the margin of one of the loveliest valleys in the world, lying in the form of a basin of a length of over ten miles, and of an average breadth of about five, entirely, inclosed with continuous ridges of lofty hills, and skirted, on the east, by a majes- tic river. It was the garden ground of the tribe of the Feathered Serpents, where, having become in a good de- gree an agricultural people, they raised an abundance of maize, pulse, and many other edible products which, with the unstinted quantities of fish taken from the rivers, and the game from the forests and prairies would have, at all times, placed the inhabitants beyond the contingencies of want, but for the ruinous tribute yearly wrung from them by the despotic government of the Imperial City. Be- sides this productive valley there was a succession of oth- ers of short intervals, both on the east and the west, and it was at the point of the convergence of thbe roads leading from the last named places, with that in which the awalt- ed train was advancing, that the opening scene of our sto- ry was located.  As Centeola and her party were nearing this central point, they suddenly came to a  halt, and faced about to the east, as if attracted by some sight or sound in that di- rection.  And, at nearly the same moment, the Sage and young chief were startled by the sounds of loud lamenta- tion, uttered evidently by some distressed female, who ap- peared to be approaching them along the road leading  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8035-00000026"/> 54         CENTEOLA; OR, from the east, and presently they caught glimpses of two men coming from  that direction, closely guarding a young female, whom  they were urging forward at a quickened pace, as if to hurry her as fast as possible out of the view of the halted train, to whom she appeared to be appealing with wild gestures and piteous outcries. "What means that, young chief?" exclaimed the Satge with a severely questioning look. "Who are those men? and what would they do with that distressed woman?" Tulozin, who instantly comprehended the true character of the scene, stood mute and abashed before the searching glance of the Sage; for the latter, he perceived, compre- hended it also. "The young chief would be thought a man and a war- rior," rebukingly resumed the Sage; "Will he go and rescue her from the hands of her oppressors?" 'Tulozin may not interfere with the orders of his king," replied the other deprecatingly. "Those men are his officers- coming in with one of the virgins destined for the coming sacrifice.' "What!"? respondedthe Sage, "That reply may be well for those who have not been yet brought to comprehend the higher commands. of the Great One above, who is King over all kings, and who would have all His creatures ready to protect the innocent from wrong and oppression." While the attention of Alcoan and Tulozin Was thus engaged, there was a visible but silent commotion going f      THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       55 on among the halted train of Centeola. Soon a sort of wake, formed by the agitation of the tall grass, and extend- ing out in a direct line from the train to a thicket border- ing on the road, through which the captive maiden and her guard were approaching, became distinctly observable, plainly indicating that some animal, or man, in a creep- ing posture, was rapidly, though invisibly, passing out through the screening grass in that direction.  But this movement had not been noticed by- the Sage and young chief; and they were therefore taken by surprise by what then quickly followed. Just as the two men and their struggling victim were passing by ,the above mentioned thicket, a large animal, having the exact resemblance of a wild panther, suddenly leaped from the bushes, and striking down the two guards-men with the rapid blows of one of his huge paws, seized the captive maiden, threw her over his back, and galloped off with her into an oppo- site thicket, leaving the amazed guard, first to stand aghast, a moment, and then to flee in wild dismay along the path whence they came. The young chief witnessed the strange incident with silent astonishment; and in that astonishment, the Sage, at first, fully participated; but new light soon broke on his mind; for knowing that Centeola's guard, of the Panther tribe, possessed the full skin of a large animal of that name, in which he sometimes disguised himself, he suspected the truth. He, however, did not impart his  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8035-00000027"/> 56         CENTEOLA; OR, surmises to the still wondering young chief, but thinking it wisdom to let the affair pass as it appeared, .quietly re- marked: "Tulozin now sees that the rescue which he declined to attempt, the Great Spirit has found means to accomplish." "But the maiden," said Tulozin, ' is rescued from one death only to meet a speedier one under the rending jaws of the furious brute that seized her." "Even at that," returned the Sage, " it were far bet- ter; for then her death goes not to swell the measure of the nation's manifold iniquities nor to hasten the nation's doom." The conversation was here cut short by the arrival of Centeola and her train. As they came up they changed front, the warriors stepping aside and falling into the rear, and the maidens leading the way. At the head of the lat- ter gracefully rode the queenly Centeola; while by her side walked her confidential friend, the staid and comely Mitla. The slightly varying costumes of the maidens were extremely neat and tasteful, consisting of light feath- erwork head-dresses, jackets made of fawn skins, tanned and softened to the, flexibility and whiteness of the finest, modern flannel, and skirts of the neatly woven and well- bleached fibres of the wild hemp; all falling over tightly fitting embroidered buskins. Such, with their'various or- naments as variously distributed, were the costumes of all the maidens; while that of Centeola, with a similar   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       57 ground-work was much richer, and more elaborately or- namented with fine shell-work and feathered embroidery. Centeola now motioned her party to halt; when riding forward to the spot where stood the Sage, she bowed her beautiful head to him in respectful salutation, and said, "Centeola keeps her appointment. She is here to greet Alcoan; but she perceives that he is not alone at the place of the appointed meeting." "Nay, my daughter, I am not. Since I reached here I have been unexpectedly joined by another, but not of- fensively, for he evidently entertains much respect and friendship for us. He is the young chief of the Buffa- loes. He thinks he once met thee with thy companions near the borders of our village." As the last words of the sage fell on the unexpectant ears of the maiden, she started almost wildly; the blood mounted to her cheeks, and she cast a furtive but eager glance at the young chief, who had modestly retired a few steps, standing aloof with averted face and eyes bent on the ground, but who now, at this implied introduction, raised his head and, with a free and manly step, advanced to the greeting. He bowed low and reverently to her,and with the look of adoration which he might be supposed to have bestowed on some celestial visitant alighting before him from the skies; while she, with quick heaving bosom, and a countenance made eloquent by the old and long sup- pressed emotions now evidently returning on her like a re-  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8035-00000028"/> 58         CENTEOLA; OR, sistless flood, bowed graciously in response to the saluta-, tion. The recognition was complete and mutual, but far too embarrassing on the part of both to admit any in- terchange of words. The pause was first broken by, Alcoan, who soon turned to his daughter and re- marked- "Tulozin, the young chief, if agreeable to my daugh- ter, would be pleased to join our company on our way to the Imperial City, of which he has recently become a resident." t We have but one mind in bur company," hesitatingly responded Centeola, subduing her emotion and summon- ing back the dignity and calmness which had so nearly forsaken her on thus unexpected meeting the unknown person, who had once been the burden of so many of her thoughts and dreams -" one mind, one religion, and one opinion respecting the demands of this alarming crisis in our public affairs.' Is he of that mind, that religion, that opinion?" "He seems willing to receive the true light, but is not yet fully in that light," -said the Sage. "But of his wish to attend us, he can speak forhimself." :"The Sage has spoken truly of my humble desire to become one of thy attendants, fair Centeola," said Tulo- zin in tones of profound respect, " and H would esteem myself greatly favored in being allowed to hold myself subject to thy wishes, - certainly so in all that shall not   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       59 require me to disobey the orders of those who have claims to my obedience. Before thy arrival, the Sage spoke of thee as of one charged with some special mission to the Imperial City.  If I better knew the character of that mission, I might be enabled to speak with less qualifica- tion." "My mission," said the maiden with some hesitation, "is not to be disclosed until it can be declared to those for whom it was intended. But as I would not willingly suffer the chief to be deceived respecting its general char- acter, I am compelled to tell him, that I go not to the great city to speak smooth and flattering words to those in authority there, but to declare to themm those truths to which they appear to be wholly blind,- to tell them plainly, that the Great Spirit is offended at their pride and their practices - that their priests are corrupt, their seers false prophets, and that they, both the better to exalt them- selves and secure place and power in the government, have combined in devising for the saving of the city and nation the very measures, which, if not stayed in the ex- ecution, will surely bring down the judgments of Heaven. Now is Tulozin prepared to aid a mission like that?" The young chief made no reply, but stood mute and sorrowful. And the Sage perceiving that an answer was not to be expected from the former, turned to Centeola and said, "Those who grope in darkness cannot with safety or e^  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8035-00000029"/> 60       ,  CENTEOLA; OR, benefit be brought suddenly into the rays of the sun. Thou hast thrown more on the mind of the young chief than he can at once receive and comprehend. It only blinds and bewilders him." "It is not that which now troubles me," responded the young chief with saddened and anxious look. "It is the thought of the certain reproaches and, I fear, great perils, to which the fair Centeola will expose herself if she goes into the Imperial City and proclaims what she so boldly proposes. Will the rulers brook such condemna- tion of their practices and their policy? And will the seers and priests, who are the advisers of those rulers, submit to be called-false prophets and to hear their rites denounced?  Rather than -incur these hazards, would not Centeola do well to forego lher intention?" "Nay, chief," replied the maiden kindly but firmly. "Centeola can never consent to forego the execution of a mission, which she feels to have been prompted by the Great Spirit, and on the success of which, as she thinks she has been enabled to foresee, hangs the destiny of the -country." "Centeola has answered wisely;" observed the Sage, "The voice of the Great Spirit in the heart is not to be disobeyed; though kings frown, and the priestly workers of iniquity denounce and threaten. He who prompted this mission can protect her who is sent to execute it, and should she be so protected then will the young chief take that   THE MATn OF THE MOUNDS.       6t as a token that she is in the right; that her God is the true God, and be ready to declare his belief accordingly?" "Tulozin," replied the young chief, " would gladly be spared to witness such a test; but he will accept it as such and abide by it in the manner proposed by the Sage." {'It is well-I am    content," rejoined the other. "But does the young chief still entertain apprehensions for our safety?" "I wish I could say I do not," returned Tulozin with an air of concern.  c"But I know how some have been dealt with, who opposed our rulers, and especially those who offended  the Seers and chief priests. There are deep dungeons under the temple of Mixitli." "It may all be as thou sayest," responded the former; "but Centeola and Alcoan are not to be deterred from their duties by any such unworthy fears, even were they well grounded. But in our case, at least, they are not; for I, too, may have a mission to execute; anrd in the ex- ecution I shall be aided by a talisman too potent to be dis-. regarded by any of those who may have the will and the power to injure or molest us." "The Sage speaks words of mystery, to which I can say nothing"  said Tulozin wonderingly. "But I  will trust that thy faith is not misplaced. I will trust that both Centeola and Alcoan will be blessed and protected by her God, and his God." "And why not also say Tulozin's God?" asked the  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8035-00000030"/> 62         ENTEOLA; OR, maiden with a sweet and winning smile, which sent such a thrill of emotion through the heart of the other as pre- - vented him, for the moment, from attempting any reply. Regaining command of his feelings, however, he slowly and thoughtfully responded: "Every word which has fallen from thy lips, beaute- ous maiden, has sunk deep in my heart. From the dis- course I held with the wise and worthy Alcoan here, be- /  fore thou and thy train arrived, with what thou hast thy- self since expressed, I think I now comprehend thy views and his, respecting all thou wouldst impress on my mind. Most of those views are new to me, and different from what I have believed; but I will ponder them well, with the honest desire to become convinced of the truth,to be- come eight and to do right. But true and lasting convic- tion is not the growth of an hour. Thou hast opened a new and bright path before me, leading wide away from the shadowy one whichI was treading. .Let me pause  and reflect before I fully enter it.' "The young chief has spoken like a Sage," said Alco- an. "There is much wisdom in his words. Then let us press him no more on these subjects at present, my daugh%- ter; but, if he still desires it, let us bid him welcome to a place in our train." Centeola graciously nodded her approbation of this pro- position; and the young chief repaid her and the Sage with a look of the liveliest gratification: for with his in-   THE MAT OF THE MOUNDS.       68 tense feelings of devotion towards the maiden, and his corresponding anxiety to gain her good will, of which, from the first part of her discourse, he had begun to des- pair, he was but too thankful for even this uncertain in- dication of her favor. Centeola's maiden attendants had, in the meanwhile, prepared and -spread on the green grass on the well shad- ed bank of a sparkling rivulet, a collation of food, con- sisting mainly of cooked venison, cakes baked from the finely pounded maize; and delicious native wines. contained in gourd shell bottles, which, with the articles of food, had been brought along with the train by the appointed pro- vider for the occasion. And they all now, including the gratified Tulozin, sat down to their sylvan repast. After this was partaken. the young chief proposed to go forward in advance to the city to prepare quarters for the train; which he thought he could obtain in a bouse adjoining that of his father. And the proposal being accepted, he immediately departed for that purpose, proposing to re- turn and meet them on the way, or at the gate of the city, while the train, as soon as the heat of the noon-day sun was abated, should follow at their leisure. /  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8035-00000031"/> CENTEOLA; OR, CHAPTER IV. The sun was now fast verging westward. The train which had been for some time slowly moving along the ascending road, with Centeola on her steed, and Alcoan walking by her side both a short distance in advance of the rest; had at length reached the highest ground, or table land, which here spread out into a wide, undulating plain, everywhere covered with an exuberant vegetation of intermingling forest trees, low coppice, rank grasses and wild flowers, and extending away to the confines of the Imperial City.  The day had been unusually warm throughout; and now, though the sun had greatly declined, the heat seemed to have increased; and there was a strange sultriness in the atmosphere, which became almost insup- portable. At the instance, therefore, of the Sage, the whole party came to a halt; and, to rest and refresh them- selves, took refuge in the extended shade of a clump of wide spreading oaks. "Does my father perceive anything unusual in the air ? 7 asked Centeola, after dismounting and taking her stand by the side of the other. $   "He does," replied the Sage, thoughtfully scanning the heavens, and then   glancing along, the earth in different directions.  "The air seems to be full of portents.  He began- to perceive them before reaching the summit level, and now   they are more palpable than ever. The sun appears blood-shot, and all along the earth glows and quivers the disturbed atmosphere, which, moreover has become so thick and mephitic, that it stifles us in the breathing.  This is not the air which the Great Spirit made for us to inhale. One might well fancy it the air of Mitelan,-that dark abode of the wicked dead -escaping from their place deep down in the bowels of the earth." "But what does my father think these things may por- tend ? " asked the former. "He is not yet able to divine," answered the other musingly, " but they doubtless are not without their sig- nificance. They may be portents of something unusual about to occur.)) The conversation was here interrupted by the exclama- tions of one of the company, who, having wandered some rods out from the road into the adjoining copse, proclaim- ed a mysterious and startling discovery.  All imme- diately hastened to the spot, and plainly discerned faint puffs of smoke issuing, at brief intervals, from the crevices of the point of a loose ledge of rocks, which were here found projecting a few feet above the surface of the  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8035-00000032"/> "        CENTEOLA; OR, ground. Most of the company, at first asserted that the smoke must proceed from the remains of some fire, which had been kindled -in, or over these rock fissures. But after a close examination, it was ascertained that no fire could have been kindled there, and that there was no sod or fuel in any of the crevices on which one could be fed. And, besides that, the smoke was of a singular, bluish hue; and, what was still more calculated to produce won-, der -and alarm, it gave out a strange, sulphurous odor, which could not have-proceeded from any ordinary fire. All stood mute in astonishment at this curious develope- ment. And their astonishment in a few moments more rose to feelings of awe and dismay as they plainly detected a tremulous motion of the earth beneath their feet, occa- sionally attended with low, deep, and scarcely audible noises, resembling the soughing of the wind. The eyes of all, with that common impulse by which the feebler ever instinctively look to the stronger in intellect in cases of this kind, at once turned to the Sage and his daughter, for some explanation of the alarming phenomenon. "The very earth is shuddering at the wickedness of a city she is compelled to bear on her bosom," thoughtfully observed Centeola as if in response to the inquiring looks of those around her. "But fear not. The portent is not meant for us, and should cause us no other anxiety than to press forward to perform the duties of our mission be- fore it may be fo;ever too late to avail those whom it was intended to save."   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       6T "Centeola'sa words are from on high,' added the Sage "Let us heed them, and fearlessly go forward in our pur- pose." As the company, in hurrying away from the ominous locality, were regaining the road, they came upon Mitla; who had not gone forward with the rest to see the wonder; conversing with a stout, fine looking young warrior, whom the Sage recognized as the one of Centeola's guards who had been missing from the company since the victim vir- /gin was so strangely snatched from her captors on the bor- der of the prairie, as described in the preceding chapter, but who had now just arrived to resume his place in the train. As soon as the Sage perceived him, he looked in- quiringly at his daughter; when the latter, instead of di- rectly replying to the implied enquiry, turned to Mitla and said, "My father, Mitla, would probably like to know certainly what I think he now only guesses. Thy warrior friend, here, will keep no secret from thee-question him on the subject." With a blush that betrayed the fact that the warrior was an accepted lover, the staid Mitla said to him- "Wampa, the Sage would know whether the dove that was snatched from the clutches of the hawks is now placed beyond their reach?" -          r "Safe," replied the other, " safe, but in covert till-the danger is over."  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8035-00000033"/> 68         CENTEOLA; OR, - "It is well," said Alcoan. "It was a brave and worthy deed of the young warrior, but not perchance without risk to him. Let no tongue proclaim it, when we reach the Imperial City." The company then again set forward on their journey, and for the next hour slowly pursued their way without further adventure or interruption; when they unexpect- edly encountered a numerous party of rough, swarthy looking men, approaching them in thee road from the op- posite direction. The peculiar kind of tools they carried, together with their equipments and smoke-blackened faces proclaimed them to be smiths, or the workers of some kind of metals. As they neared each other, both parties came to a halt, according to an established custom of the coun- try, which, in the absence of any other means than that of oral communication, had become a necessity for acquir- ing news and information, and which, therefore, required parties meeting each other in the road, to stop and mutu- ally impart such tidings from their respective sections as they might have in their possession. a 'Travellers, we greet thee," said Alcoan advancing a few steps forward of his company, and respectfully bow- ing to the strangers. "Thy greeting we kindly- return," responded one of the latter in behalf of the rest, " and would like to learn from whence are thy party, and whither bound?" "We are from the village of the Feathered Serpents,   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       69 and bound on a visit to the Imperial City. And now, in turn, we would know whence thy company, and wherefore journeying Southward?" "We are a company of unfortunate miners from the borders of the great lake of the North, where, as is doubtless well known to thee, the King's copper mines are mostly situated." { Even so; and we may count ourselves highly favored, at this juncture, in the opportunity of learning the news from that region; for from thence strange and alarming reports are everywhere spreading over all this part of the country." . "t No more alarming than true, as our own sad experience, and fortunate escape with our lives, will amply testify. The whole region, where me were lately pursuing our occupations in peace and good thrift, is now being overrun by the swarming hordes of a foe, more savage and fero- cious than the wild beasts of prey. We were driven by them from the mines and our workshops, many days ago, leaving half our number slain, wounded, or in the hands of the enemy, reserved for death or torture. The shops and houses of all the miners, after having been plunder- ed, were given to the fames. All their provisions, and all the products of their labors, including thousands of spears, long knives and axes, made to supply the King's armies, were seized and carried away.

"Didst thou stop at the Imperial City with the news?" "No, we did not; but all the Kingis workmen did. We, being private workmen, or among those who work on privileges rented from the government, had no duty to perform, but to hurry home to make preparations for defending our families from the common danger, either, by gathering them into the village strongholds, or fleeing with them to a country where this dreadful enemy will not reach us." "But how near has the van of the invading army reached by this time?" "Within a day's march, perhaps." "How are they armed?- " "At first when they assailed us, they were armed only with bows and arrows, and heavy war-clubs; but after they had plundered our work-shops, all that had been ena- bled thus to obtain a supply, armed themselves, as we   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.        71 ascertained by hovering on their flank for the first day- of our flight, with knives, spears and axes, the advantages of which they no doubt at once perceived."'

They are much larger and taller men than our nation, and being .clothed in the hairy skins of wild animals, they look as formidable as the rushing herds of the buffalo, before which our bravest and stoutest warriors and hunters would be borne down and trampled into the earth. Lucky will it be if our vil- lage strongholds can withstand their terrible assaults, and luckier still for the Imperial City, whose richness in its vast stores of provisions, of which they have doubtless heard, and of which they are evidently intent on possess- ing themselves, will tempt them to more desperate onsets. But thy inquiries being now answered, permit us to hurry on and spread the alarm among the people, and warn them of the danger now so certainly at hand." The Sage and his daughter with their faithful and de- voted attendants now, for some time, pursued their way with the thoughtful silence which the tidings they had just heard, added to the strange phenomenon they had previ- ously witnessed was, for different reasons, so well calcula- ted to create. It was not long, however, before their at- tention began to be attracted by objects immediately li  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8035-00000035"/> 72         CENTEOLA; OR,   around them; for by this time, the indications that they were drawing near a great and populous city became more i and more palpable. Well beaten paths, falling into the main  road from the surrounding country on either side, were now frequently encountered, and along each of these con- centering avenues, were seen hastening forward, in pairs' or singly, men, women and children, laden with baskets ! or sacks of various kinds of provisions, culinary utensils, pottery, wooden wares and many other articles of traffic; 'all pouring into the great. thoroughfare on their way to ? supply the markets of the Imperial City. Keeping their g company as distinctly separate as possible from the mov-  ing throng before and behind them, Alcoan and Centeola i with quickened pace pressed forward to their destination; and soon the walls and towers of the city became plainly discernible in the distance. In a short time they arrived ' ; at the great western gate, which was the most frequented  entrance into the city from the country adjoining it; but ' not deeming it expedient to attempt to enter now, they  filed away to a little elevation about a hundred yards dis-  tant and there came to a stand to await the promised corm-  ing of the young chief. While standing here with their attention generally di- I rected to the towers, temples and other of the more prom- ! inent objects of the city, they were startled by the sharp  exclamations of surprise of one of their number; and suddenly turning they beheld Mitla standing a little aloof i   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.73             A from the rest and pointing wildly up a broad, graded pathway, coming in from a rock quarry in plain sight, less than a half mile to the west. "Look! look!" she exclaimed, "hills of living, mov- ing flesh.! what are the monsters?" All eyes instantly followed the direction indicated by her extended arm; when they saw moving down the road towards them, two animals so huge as to surpass in size all other known quadrupeds as much as the largest buffalo surpasses the lightest antelope.- In shape and ap- pearance they were something between the ox and the ele- lant with double and treble the bulk of the latter, and much longer bodied in proportion than either. To their snouts was attached a short, stout elephant-like proboscis, used by them to pull down saplings and the lower limbs and boughs of large trees, on which they mostly fed. They were fastened like a yoke of oxen, to a sort of drag, composed of stout timbers, into which, next the ground, were framed large wooden rollers to relieve the draft. On this drag had been placed an enormous stone, weigh- ing forty or fifty tons, and with this load they were mak- ing their way along the hard beaten road in the direction of the Western entrance into the city, under guidance of half a dozen drivers, who, with long lance-shaped goads, urged them forward and kept them in the road. "They are marmmoths, of which you have all heard, 4   &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8035-00000036"/> 74          CENTEOLA; OR, though never perhaps have before seen," remarked the Sage.* 'I have always known," observed Centeola, "that these monster animals, which I now for the first time with amazement behold, had an existence in some parts of the country; but I did not know that they were so docile that they could be trained to such uses." "They are,' rejoined the Sage; " though immeasura- bly the largest and most powerful of all the known ani- mals of the earth, as kind   and manageable as the cow-buffalos which we tame and keep for their milk. They are easily trained, not only, like these, to draw huge stones, which nothing else-could remove, but to bear the heaviest burdens which can be lifted upon their backs. The kings of the Imperial City have thus employed them, for many generations, for all heavy drafts; and all the great stones used in the walls of the city, and in founda- tions of the temples- have been drawn by them in the manner we are now witnessing.  But they seemed doomed to follow the fate of the horse, which has already disap- peared; a few now only remain, and it is well that it should be so. They ruin the forests wherever they move, * The Mammoth or more properly the Mastodon, says Hugh Miller, though an animal of a very early age in Europe, was of a comparatively modern age in America. Thos is confirmed by the fact that their bones have been found in this country very near, and sometimes almost on the surface of the ground. It is therefore doing no violence to probability to suppose they had not become extinct at the period of our story.   and thus destroy- the food of thousands of the lesser, but more useful animals, like the elk and deer, which have an equal right to live. And for this, the Great Spirit and wise Provider for all created animals, has doubtless de- creed 'that this whole race of monsters shall pass away and be known no more to man, forever, unless, it may be, by the huge bones found in the earth which they once devastated." The attention of the amazed company had by this time become riveted on the passing spectacles of the mastodons and the stupendous boulder they were drawing, which now approached and swept by into the city, with the deep, grinding noise of the rushing avalanche, and with a force and impetus that made the earth groan and tremble be- neath the heavy tread of those mighty feet, and the crush- ing weight of the load that was made to follow them. This novel spectacle having thus passed out of sight, the attention of the party was now directed towards the city, the greater part of which was overlooked by the little eminence where they were standing. The city, which was built on a plain, lay in the form of a parallelogram about two miles long, North and South, and about one mile broad, East and West. It was enclosed on every side by massive stone walls, fifteen feet high, which at the top were thickly studded with sharp spikes of copper, l hardened to the unyielding texture of steel, as were all the edged tools in use in the country, by the secret arts  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8035-00000037"/> 76         CENTEOLA; OR, of the smiths and miners. At the corners and mid-way of each of the four walls, rose .high above their tops,  stony square wooden towers designed both for ornament  and defense, running up into slender pinnacles above, 'being pierced all round in the parts next the tops. of the walls with loop-holes for the use of archers and spears- men. From every quarter of the compactly built city rose lofty temples, surmounted by the gilded images of  the particular deities to whose worship the structures were dedicated; while towering high over all the rest, stood the great temple of Mixitli, the reputed god of war, the as- ' sumed patron and protector of the Imperial City, and the chief object of worship among its multitudinous in- i habitants. The private dwellings of the people, like those i of all great towns, were as strongly contrasted as the con- ^ ditions of their occupants, varying from the contracted  Cabins of the poor laborer to the showy palatial mansions of the opulent nobles. ' Such were the outline views presented at a distance by the Imperial City, containing an amount of people which,  like the populous No of the Scriptures, had known no  enumeration, but which was doubtless more than enough i to constitute it the greatest native city found existing, at  the period of our tale, anywhere north bf the land of the X palm trees.

" ing to the mingled noise and tumult that rose from its crowded streets, the long expected Tulozin suddenly ap- peared before them. "I have at length procured for thee, Centeola, and her attendants, good Alcoan, a fitting establishment adjoining my father's residence," he said with a countenance full of respect and tenderness, but obviously marked with sad- ness and anxiety. "But I am not without many misgiv- ings about thy reception when the objects of thy mis- sion become known. The city is full of commotion and alarm in consequence of the news just received of the rapid advance of the dreaded foe towards us. The King and Council are in constant consultation in devising meas- ures and precautions which they may deem best calcu- [ated to meet the demands of the crisis." "   We met on the way," responded the Sage, " a com- pany of private miners and artisans, fleeing to the South, who imparted to us tidings of similar import, and who said that the King's workmen also escaped from the foe, had stopped at the city. Is it from these last that the news has been received? ' "In part; but later and more particular accnnts have been brought in by the King's runnersho though re- maining nearly two days later in sight of the invaders than the miners, yet, by their wondrous fleetness of foot, came in but a few minutes afterwards." "And what is their report, young chief?"  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8035-00000038"/> 78g        CENTEOLA; OR,  "More alarming still. They report that the enemy, after having followed down the river in: this direction, sev- H eral days, have left it and diverged to the West, so as to [ bring their line of march direct to this city, which they will reach within a day or two if not successfully resist- ed." "Who is expected successfully to interpose and resist  them between the point they have reached and this place?" "The warriors of the fortified village of the tribe of the  Bears, which will now fall in their route. The runners say  that those warriors were preparing for a desperate resist-  ance, and were confident they should be able to stay the ;- march of the savage invaders, though they have laid waste  the whole country, and driven every thing before them to i the near vicinity of that place. But notwithstanding this  hope that the advance of the foe will be thus stayed, our  rulers and, with them, the whole city, are filled with the greatest anxiety and alarm."               i The dialogue was here brought to a close by the sounds  of some new tumult within the walls in the vicinity of  the gate; and the loud voice of a man, evidently on the : approach, was heard exclaiming,  "Clear- the gate-way! imake room there for the King's  messengers!" ' It's the King's sheriff, called out only on important occa-  sions, and he therefore is doubtless dispatching messengers    THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       79 on errands of unusual moment," said Tulozin in answer to the inquiring looks of those about him. As the servile throng in and about the gate-way were promptly-falling back, the sheriff, richly accoutred in pe- culiar costume, bearing a long polished lance in his hand, wearing a tall cap faced with a bright bronze eagle, and having on his person various other ensignia denoting his authority as a high officer of the King, now issued from the gate, followed by seven young athletic men, also wear- ing the King's uniform, who, on a motion made by the former, at once arranged themselves in a line in the open space outside the walls, and stood waiting their instruc- tions. The officer there produced, and proceeded to deliv- er to them the different badges, on which were pictured the totemic emblems of the tribes, to which they were severally dispatched, and having thus supplied them all, he charged them collectively-  "To make all possible speed to the tribes, to which  their different symbols would direct them, order thchead men to summon all their warriors into the field, strength- en all their defenses, and make every other needed prep- aration to meet the enemy, who are coming down like a prairie fire, from the North. Now go, and fail not,' he added waving his lance for the departure of the royal mes-    sengers, who instantly hurried away, and, falling into the long loping trot, to which their class, as well as the com- mon runners, were trained for the attainment of the great- !  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8035-00000039"/> 80      .

As soon as the ofli- cer, had thus put the messengers on their way he turned to the guard and gave order for an early closing of thegate in their charge, and for exercising the utmost caution and rigidness in guarding it through the coming night. "The sun is sinking behind the hills and night ap- proaches now soon," observed Tulozin, arousing himself from the fit of moody abstraction into which he had fallen. "The Sage heard the order for the early closing of the gate. Let him and Centeola with their train then at once prepare for entering the cityf And Alcoan and Centeola having accordingly notified their followers to that effect, the whole company were soon in motion.; when, led on by the young chief, they passed through the gate between the lines of the guards, who, at a sign from him, readily yielded a passage, and the gate being thus passed, they at once found themselves in ofle of the most crowded streets of this great and far- noted city. Hundreds, who had- come in from the sur- rounding country to market their wares and edibles, were eagerly pressing forward towards this great western en- trance to secure their egress before the hour of closing the gate. Tradesmen of every description stood clamor- ing at their doors for customers. Provision- dealers, vend- ers of wares and trinkets, and various other kinds of market-men, with baskets in their hands or on their heads,   THE MAID' OF THE MOUNDS.       81 were jostling each other on the way, and filling the air with their cries and recommendations of the different ar. ticles they carried for sale. From every part of the city rose the sounds of the noisy war-drums. Bands of armed warriors, whose burnished spears were glittering in the rays of the setting sun, were seen marching in different directions to man the towers for the night, or guard the intermediate walls, and all, as far as eye and ear could reach, was one extended scene of commotion and tumult. The passage of Centeola and her train, as they slowly made their way through the mingled throng, under the guidance of Tulozin, who did his best to open a way for  them, seemed everywhere to-attract attention and excite curiosity, and the unwonted spectacle of the white horse, rode as it was by a maiden of such dazzling beauty, evi- dently became a matter of especial wonder and admiration. Scores of persons of all ages and sexes crowded around the embarrassed company along their road to witness the novelties which their unusual appearance presented, and but for the continued exertions of the young chief,' active- ly assisted by the bold and stalwart Wampa, they never would have been able to have effected their passage through the crowd, and among all the annoying obstacles they were compelled to encounter every rod of their progress. Find- ing this difaiculty of advancing to grow greater and greater, Tulozin suddenly changed his course, and, leading the party through less crowded streets, at length enabled them 4  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8035-00000040"/> 82         CENTEOLA; OR, to reach the quarters he had provided for them, in safety, where Centeola and her maidens found a welcome refuge from the noisy crowd and the various annoyances to which they had been subjected in this their brief city experi- ence.  )*   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       83 CHAPTER V. It was night. But night now, though so generally coming as the grateful harbinger of rest and quiet, was yet, for many long and trying hours, to bring no repose to the weary and anxious Centeola. After the company had partaken of the refreshments which, through the care and kindness of the young chief, had been liberally provided for them all, the Sage, having become more fa- tigued than the rest, on account of the infirmities of his age, retired almost immediately to his bed, which was on the ground floor of the house, and adjoining the capacious room thus far occupied by them in common. The attend- ant maidens of the train soon manifesting a disposition to follow the example, also quietly withdrew to the rooms above, which had been designated for their sleeping apart- ments, leaving Centeola, whose mingled disquietudes, occa- sioned by the various events of the day, forbade all thought of sleep, sitting alone in the apartment deeply immersed in her own peculiar reflections.' What a day had the past one been for her! What a mingling of hopes, doubts and fears had been hers since she had met Tulozin-  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8035-00000041"/> 84         CENTEOLA; OR, and discovered in him the mysterious stranger of the roman- tic forest scene, who had caused her the first great sensa- tion of her life -the sensation which she had mistakenly supposed she had effectually extinguished, but which the meeting of that day had made her deeply conscious had only slumbered in her bosom. But should he still adhere to the blind and to her abhorent idolatry, in which he had been educated, what a war with her antagonistic 'prin- ciples, and high purposes -what a painful war must she wage with her own heart. Should he change his false creed, however, and embrace her own, how bright might yet be that heart's future; which was destined to, occur? In vain she summoned her reputed powers of prophecy to enable her to foresee the event. All was dark before her. All her attempts at such forecasts only left her where they found her, the prey of the same conflicting emotions, sometimes filling her with visions of happiness, and sometimes almost overwhelming her in gloom and de- spondency. For awhile, she was permitted to indulge in these moody reveries without the occurrence of any disturbing sounds reaching her ears from without. But at length, from the increasing sounds of footfalls, and the low mingling of human voices that began to reach her, she became aware that many people were slowly passing the house, or, for some unknown 'reason, lingering in the vicinity. And- it, was not long before she distinguishkd the voice of some   THE MATD OF ToHE MOUNDS.       85 one, not of her party, who appeared- to be in altercation with her guards, stationed near the door, as if he were demanding admittance into the house. Others also seemed to be frequently arriving and making similar demands. But gathering, from what she could overhear, that all such applicants had been repulsed by the guards, and deeming herself entirely secure from intrusion, she did not withdraw from the room, or extinguish the resinous flame that, as darkness approached, had been kindled on the hearth-stone for lighting the apartment, but, with; list- less curiosity, sat listening to the different sounds coming from without, some little time longer; when she was sud- denly aroused by the sounds of footsteps within the room, and turning, she beheld, with deep surprise, standing near the entrance from the street, the muffled figure of a man, who had found some means of eluding her guards, or forcing his way through them and entering the house. "Who is this, that forces his way into my room unbid- den, at this hour of the night?" demanded the startled maiden, hastily rising and confronting the strange figure. "It is one," replied the latter evasively, but with an assumed tone of respect, 1" who comes from those in au- thority to ascertain what distinguished strangers have ar- rived in the city, that they may be suitably provided for, and honored." "That knowledge, methinks,' responded the maiden re- bukingly, FI might have been easily obtained from the at- tendants at the door."  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8035-00000042"/> 86         OENTEOLA; OR, "They refused me the information I sought" said the stranger. "Then why should I furnish it, especially till I know by what authority, and by whom I am questioned?"said the former with increasing doubt and suspicion. The intruder then thrust aside his muffling head-gear, fully disclosed his face, and, looking steadfastly at the the maiden a moment, significantly asked, "Dost thou know me now, perverse one?" Centeola looked up, and as her eyes fell on the face of the unblushing questioner, she involuntarily recoiled. It was the sinister-eyed Emissary who had, some months be- fore, in company with a colleague or an accomplice, visited her father's lodge and there given her so much reason to remember him with abhorrence. "Yes, I know thee now, - in character at least, and can easily conjecture the true motives which prompted this questionable visit. Leave me, intruder, or I summon my guards from the street." "Do so, and gee if they heed thy bidding.  Thy guards are all in safe custody, and guards whom I con- trol have taken their place." "Despicable plotter! But thinkest thou thus to tri- umph? I will call my father and my maidens from their beds to confront thee, and learn thy baseness both here and heretofore." "Do so, if thou thinkest it wisdom for thee-do so,   THE VMAT) OF THE MOUNDS.      87 and before they ,can appear in thy behalf, my guards, rushing in here at my signal, will have thee on the way to my house. But I would not be driven to such meas- ures - I would have thee listen to the voice of reason and to what it is thy true wisdom to concede without re- sorting to anything so unpleasant. Fair Centeola, I would gladly be thy- friend and protector. Forego thy wild and vain notions of opposing the policy of our rulers, and fly with me to my house. I will make thee rich, and defend thee from the punishment which thy now well known conduct and purposes will otherwise bring down on thy head. Wilt thou accept my offer.?" "Never-- no, never, wretch! Leave me! Begone!" I will not leave thee. Defy me no longer. I have sufficient evidence of thine, and thy father's doings and de- signs to thwart the government, to ensure thine and his condemnation before the Council. Persist in thy refusal and I use it - consent, and I save thee, and thy father. Wilt thou listen to me now?"' "' Thy proffered- bribes and thy cowardly threats I alike scorn and despise:-- I fear thee not. The good and Great Spirit, in whom I trust would never have permitted thee to find thy way hither, without providing some means for my protection against thy base designs." "Then thou wilt persist in setting me at defiance? We will see who will help thee in thy foolish obduracy," said the enraged speaker, turning towards the door to sum-  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8035-00000043"/> 88.        CENTEOLA; OR, mon in his minions to aid in fulfilling his threat of a forcible abduction. But his movement was arrested by an appearance which he was then little expecting. At that instant an interior door flew- open, and the aged Al- coan hastily came forth from it, and fearlessly advanced on the shameless intruder. "Man, I know thee well," said the Sage sternly. "( Was it not enough for thee to abuse the hospitalities of my lodge at our village, on a former occasion, by insulting my daughter, that thou should steal in here to-night to re- peat the indignity? Thy name and station in this city, if the conjectures I have bformed, but never yet expressed, are correct, might awe some into silence; but they have no terrors for me; and whoever and whatever thou art, I bid thee depart, or, to-morrow I will proclaim thy double villany from every house-top in the Imperial City." While Centeola was escaping to her chamber, on the appearance of her father, her infamous persecutor struck dumb by this sudden and bold interposition of the Sage, and alarmed at some of his intimations, shrunk abashed out of the house, and departed to devise other means to effect his still unrelinquished purposes. Centeola was now safe in the solitary room' which, in consideration of her position had been reserved for her sole occupation for the night. This apartment was an up- per room of the house, fronting 'the street, and having one window, which could be opened and closed by neatly   THE MATD OF THE MOUNDS.       89 constructed lattice-work slides. By the side of this, all inclination to sleep being now farther removed than ever. she took her seat,- and, partially opening it, peered out into the street, to catch sight of what might there be pass-- ing, and listen to the nearer mingled sounds or the more distant hum that still rose from various parts of the city. Though her persecutor and his minions had all disap- peared, yet others were seen lurking in the streets, and soon she perceived that this class of persons were greatly increasing, and what added more to her surprise and un- easiness, she noted by the light of a stationary, or public torch, that most of those passing or pretending to pass, paused against the house, and seemed to be marking its appearance, or rather acting like spies in attempting to discover whether any movements were going on among its inmates. All immediate uneasiness of this kind however was the next moment removed; for hearing the sounds of ' footsteps approaching the house, she glanced down into the street; and, to her great gratification, she beheld her own guard, before whom the crowd gave away, returning and taking their places before her door. In the hope of learning, -from what they might utter to one another, how they had been driven away, and then permitted to return, all which would doubtless serve to some extent to explain the strange movements of the night, she bent down her ear and listened intently. Soon she noticed some one is- -suing from a dark alley on the opposite side of the street, 8I        /-  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8035-00000044"/> 90.        CENTEOLA; OR,  whom she recognized to be Wampa, her bold and trusty Panther attendant, who had figured in rescuing the victim virgin from her impending doom. As he now came for- ward, he was hailed by one of his fellow guardsmen and asked how it happened that he had not been taken prisoner as well as the rest of them?" "Because I did not show myself at all to the assault- ing band," replied Wampa.  "Before they appeared, I had placed myself in the opening of yon narrow alley, that I might better watch the suspicious movements I had no- ticed going on in the street. And when they came and drove you away, leaving a strong guard in your place, I plainly saw, though unseen myself, all that took place." "And what did take place after we left?" anxiously enquired the former. "Is Centeola and her company safe?" "All safe," returned Wampa. 'But Centeola was the only one endangered. The plot, which was to entrap and carry her off, was intended only for her. I saw that audacious interloper, whom you had repulsed, place his minions at the door, and then stealthily enter the room, where Centeola, who had lingered behind, after her father and her maidens had all retired, sat alone wholly unsus- pecting any intrusion. Soon after that, I gathered from her indignant words which occasionally reached me from her clear voice, what he was- proposing and threatening; when I hastily incased myself in my panther skin, and   THE MAID OF THE -MOUNDS.       91- the next moment should have made a rush through the guards into the house and hurled the villain into the street. But I was saved the task by the sudden appear- ance of the old Sage, who, being fully aroused to anger, effected with words nearly all I should have done with deeds, which may be well for me; for I strongly suspect that the fellow, as base as he has shown himself, is-one of the great men of the city. But now, in turn, let me inquire what befel the rest of you after being driven off, and how did you escape from your captors so as to get back so soon?" "As you saw," answered the other, " we were all sud- denly beset by an overpowering number of armed men and forced along to a distant part of the city; when hav- ing been disarmed, part of our captors retired, leaving us under the guard of the rest, from whom; after regaining our arms, which had been incautiously left within our reach, we soon forcibly broke away, and returned unmo- lested to this place.  This is all I have to impart except that, on our way back, we encountered our good friend, the young chief, returning he said from a short visit to the Royal Council Chamber; when we told him, as far as we' then knew, all that had occurred." "And what did he say??" asked the former. "He was greatly disturbed and excited," replied the other, "and, after questioning us closely about the ap- pearance of the man, whom we had foiled in his attempts  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8035-00000045"/> 92         CENTEOLA; OR, to get into the house, before we were ourselves driven off, he hurried away, saying he would go and raise men of his own to strengthen or relieve four guard, and with them soon meet us here; when he would enquire into the mean- ing and mystery of the outrage." Although the speakers had imparted by their conversa- tion, with the exception of the gratifying account they gave of the meeting with Tulozin, but little more than what the fair listener already knew, or had inferred. from the words of her persecutor himself, she had listened to the details they gave of. their adventures with lively in- terest. ]Better than they, however, could -she judge of the motives which had led to the insult she had received. She believed, therefore, the aggression both within doors and, without, was the work of one individual, But from all the attendant circumstances, she could not but infer, that this individual must be a person of no little rank and power in the city. And she consequently now, for the first time began to entertain serious apprehensions of the consequences, which the balked villain in his revenge might cause to be visited on herself and her father. But who could he be? was this indeed a true specimen of the rulers of the Imperial City? If so, well might their wickedness. and corruption call down the vengeance of a just Heaven.  But this train of thought was speedily broken by the voice of Tulozin in the street below, who had arrived with -three well armed attendants to add to *s,   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       98 her guard. To catch his first words, she listened with ea- ger attention, and it was with a secret pleasure, which she would have hardly acknowledged, even to herself, that she heard him first making anxious enquiries for her and her safety. He then closely questioned her guard about kthe character of the intrusion they had reported to him, the personal appearance of the intruder and all the cir- cumstances connected with the strange and, even at the best, most suspicious transaction. He however seemed to be restrained from giving any opinion of his own on the subject, and after stationing his own men, supplying the others with additional arms, and enjoining on all the closest vigilance in watching thee house, and determination of defending it, if assaulted, he slowly, and with an air of hesitation and perplexity, re- tired to his own quarters. Centeola, however, still re- maining wakeful under the agitating effects of the strangely contrasted scenes of which she had that day and evening become cognizant, continued at her post of obser- vation sometime longer. ' The nearly full moon was now struggling up through the lurid haze that hung ominous- ly along the Eastern horizon, shedding-her pale and sickly light over temple, tower and house-top, and throwing a singularly dismal aspect over every-thing below, while glaring meteors were shooting widely athwart the heavens above.

Deeply pondering over these mysteries, which she could not but regard as of evil omen to the city, and therefore to be taken by her, who would save it, as monitions to press resolutely forward to the discharge of the duties she came there to perform, the maiden now retired to her couch, and, after invoking the blessings of the Most High on herself and friends, was soon lost in peaceful slumbers.   THE MAID OF TEE MOUNDS.       95 CHAPTER VT. While the scenes last described were transpiring, mat- ters of far greater moment to the public, but still more or i less involving the fate of the leading personages of our story, were on the tapis in another part of the city, which r was deemed the more peculiar precinct of royalty and power, and which, therefore, was generally known by the appellation of the Sacred Enclosure. This place was separated from the rest of the city by a wall about ten feet high, embracing an oblong square area of perhaps fifteen acres. On the East side of this square stood the Great Temple of Mixitli, who as the God of war, and supposed protecting deity of the city, received the chief and high- est worship of its idolatrous people. In a line with .this imposing edifice, and on the same side of the square, stood the lesser temples and sacred pyramids, consecrated to various inferior deities, the largest and most conspicuous of which was the temple of the greatly feared Michlan- teuct, the God of Hell.  On the West side, and nearly opposite the Great Temple, was the Royal Council Hall, the great state edifice of the city. Beyond, and about  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8035-00000047"/> 96         CENTEOLA; OR, mid-way the wall, rose the king's palace, a connected pile of costly structures, the- central one of which rose high above the rest,-and terminated in a gilded pinnacle. The next in size and magnificence, was the residence, or palace as it might well be called, of the great High Priest of the God of War, situated in the middle of the northerly end of the enclosure; while all the intermediate spaces along the walls on either side, were filled with the mansions of the more powerful and favored nobles, high officers of state, and the humbler houses of the Seers, and the numer- 4 ous priests and their subordinates, who administered the religious rites and ceremonies in the temples dedicated to the different deities of general or partial worship among the people. In -view,of thhe alarming exigencies of the hour, the king, with a small retinue of officials and trusty attend- ants, had, early that evening, repaired to the Great Coun- cil Hall, there to meet those on whom he most relied for advice and assistance in administering the government. The ordinary meetings of the Council were not generally attended by the king, or if attended by him, it was in his common apparel, and rather as a spectator than a partici- pant. But on this :important occasion, when the news last received made all feel conscious that the safety of the city was at stake, he came attired injhis royal robes and diadem, and -took the great chair of state, designed to be -occupied only by the ruling- sovereigns. The king was   THE MATD OF THE MOUNDS.       97 evidently now fast approaching the confines of old ago. And the total lack of firmness and resolution which his looks exhibited showed that his mental and moral faculties had even preceded his physical energies in the process of decay. He had been an exacting despot, and, until re- cently, he had viewed his Council only as mere creatures of his will. But all his arrogance had now forsaken him. He seemed to have lost all confidence in his own resources in the present emergency, and under the lively apprehen- sions of dangers to grow out of it, which had obviously seized him, he looked helplessly around him for the advice and support of the very men whose counsel he had been wont to reject whenever it failed to tally with his wish- es. His councillors, who were also generally past the middle age, all seemed equally impressed with their royal master, with the perils of the crisis, and equally anxious that something shall be done to avert them. But what that something was no one seemed prepared to indicate. The minds of all appeared to be undecided and fluctuating. In the colloquial discussion that now ensued, some sug- gested one measure, some another; while none of them seemed long to adhere to the opinions they had advanced, but eagerly watched to hear new propositions. In sh ort it soon became evident, that their counsels were so entire- ly distracted that no measure promising any additional safety to the city could be adopted, or even confidently proposed; and to add to their fears and perplexities, fresh 6              ,-   &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8035-00000048"/> aa 9        CENTEOLA; OR, reports of the formidable strength and alarming advance of the invading foe were every little while arriving.' Run- ner after- runner, coming from the vicinity of the hostile array, came in, as the night advanced, each bringing tidings more alarming than those of the one last preceding him. 'And at length,- to complete the consternation, one ar- rived and rushed in hot haste to the Council Hall with the startling intelligence, that the enemy had assaulted and car- ried the defenses of the warlike tribe of the Bears, scatter- ing their warriors and people like autumn leaves in a tem- pest, before the irresistible onset, and leaving the way open to the former, if left unopposed, for a victorious march on the city within the next twenty-four hours. "( It is the duty of the Council to provide full and suffi- cient measures for the safety of-the city," exclaimed the fear-smitten old King, his cracked voice trembling with agitation, as he thrust out his hands, with half menacing, half imploring gestures, towards the scarcely less troubled councillors before him.-"Yes, it is their plain duty; and yet no one speaks to any purpose. But something must be done immediately, and I command it to be done." "I propose then," said one of the leading councillors, thus driven to some kind of action by the absurd mandate of the King, "I -propose that we send out a thousand warriors to meet the foe and stay their progress, so that they shall not be suffered to approach the city, and com- pel us to place our only hope on the doubtful result of   THE MATn  OF THE MOUNDS.      99 the fierce assault which, if they reached here, they would doubtless make on every part of the walls." "Would that bethe partof wisdom and prudence?" asked another leading councillor. "If the enemy are so strong as to have defeated the Bear warriors, as numerous and brave as they are, would our less hardy city warriors be likely to meet a better fate?" "No," said a third; "and even should they not be routed, would not the foe, who are said to be as numerous as the leaves of the forest, be apt, while part of their army was engaging our warriors, throw another force round be- hind them and cut them off from the city, so that they could render us no further aid?" "Then let none of my warriors leave the city," here interposed the timid old king. ' We shall need them all to man the walls and towers. The forces of the Imperial City must not be weakened. As you all know, I am the last of the Royal family. My sons conspired against me and were justly put to death. My two wives, the good one and the bad one, are both-dead. My two daughters, who, by a law of our kingdom, might also, when there were no sons, have rightfully come to the throne at my death, have likewise passed away, one early, the other more recently. I am therefore, a poor lone old man. If I die, there is none to succeed me, and the kingdom will be broken up.

Stand by your king, then, and his throne, as the last hope of the nation. The measure proposed is not a good one, and must be abandoned. Let the council devise other measures. It is for them, I re- peat, to concert some measure which will secure the safety of the city and the king. And first, I call on my faith ful old councillor, Huasco, for his opinion. He has nevei yet failed me in any emergency. He is wise in all things, and will not fail to see and tell us what is best to be done." The person addressed, who was no other than the elder of the two emissaries, who had visited the Sage and his daughter at their village, as described in a former chapter, now rose in obedience to the call of the king and said - "Nobody here has yet said anything about the protec- tion of the Oods. If they are against us, they will make our warriors weak and-feeble-hearted as women in the pres- ence of the foe. But if they are for us, our warriors will be strong, and no enemy can prevail over them. Let us first seek to know, then, how the Gods are affected towards us in this crisis, and if we find they are adverse, it be- hoves us to ascertain the cause, that it may be removed and their favor be again secured. But I am no Seer or Priest to decide these momentous questions. I propose, therefore, that the Seers and Priests be immediately sum- moned to appear before us, that we may hear their opin- ions and take measures accordingly." This proposal being unanimously approved by the king   TEE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       101 and council, messengers were at once despatched to sum- mon all the leading seers and priests to give their attend- ance forthwith at the Great Council Hall, for the pur- poses which the mover of the measure had designated. And in a short time, nearly a dozen of these professional dignitaries; who had ever been allowed to exercise an im- portant influence in the affairs of the government, and whose opinions, as among all superstitious nations in times of great public fears and perplexities, were likely to out- weigh those of the wisest councillors, were formally ushered into the Hall. And after the reasons for sum- moning them thus to favor the council with their pres- ence in this crisis of the city's and the nation's peril, were explained, they were respectfully invited to offer their opinions and advice. "The Gods are evidently angry with us," said a lead- ing Seer, in response to the demand, which he now under- stood to be made on the professional gifts of himself and brother Seers. "They have veiled their faces from us during the Iast day or two. They have withheld the light of prophecy. They have shut up the spirit Heavens, so that we cannot see, as usual, what is, and what is to be. There is a cloud over the present, and all looks dim and confused along the vistas of the future. There must be potent reasons for this; but to me it has not been re- vealed."    . "Our brother has spoken well," said a second Seer,  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8035-00000050"/> 102        CENTEOLA; OR, who like the former and the rest of his class, had always prophecied smooth things to the rulers, assuring them that the foe were not to advance on the city, but now, in the face of the developements of the night, dare do so no long- er. "He has spoken the words of truth. His experi- ence is the experience of us all. -The spirit Heavens are dark to-night. We cannot pierce them so as to read what is to befall in the future, of which we are left to judge only by visible signs and portents. And these even are of such a new and mysterious character that we are much at fault in determining their significance." "Have any such signs and portents been discovered the past day, or to-night?" anxiously inquired a coun- cillor. "Ay, many," returned the former. "They have been disclosed to me both in the heavens above and the earth beneath. The moon and stars seem to me to wear to- night, a very unnatural and ominous appearance. Even the very air around us- seems changed from its natural condition by some malign influence. But it is now espe- cially the earth that furnishes the most mysterious omens. I have heard- strange, hollow sounds which seemed to issue from the ground, and more than once I have distinctly perceived long quivering vibrations passing through the earth beneath my feet. This last omen seems to me to indicate that the dreaded Mictlanteuct, the God of Hell, whose, throne is deep down towards the middle of the   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       103 earth, is moving against us., But wherefore I know not. His chief priest, however, is present, and may perchance be able to tell what disturbs -this God, and what will be required to propitiate him." "He requires blood -the blood of a human victim," responded the priest thus appealed to, a huge, deformed and every way repulsive looking being, and for that very reason deemed all the more suitable representative of the grim God, to whose service he was devoted. "He is an- gry- ay, justly angry at the neglect he has experienced at the hands of our people. Sacrifices have been made to other gods, but none to him. He demands that the sacrifice of a man should be made to him, in the dark, and at his appropriate hour of midnight. And I am clearly of the opinion that nothing short of that will propitiate him, and prevent him from throwing his fearful power in favor of the invading foe, who are perhaps more natural- ly his children than we." "But there is another God whom it is a thousand times more our interest first to propitiate," here eagerly inter- posed a priest of the great temple, " and that is the great Mixitli, the all potent God of war, who has always been regarded as the especial guardian of our people, and the champion spirit of our nation, having conducted us trium- phantly through all our wars, and aided us to establish and raise our kingdom to its present proud position of power and glory. Ay, and there is good reason why he ^                       -.  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8035-00000051"/> 104        CENTEOLA; OR, should first receive our attention: for it is among the -alarming circumstances of the hour, that he, too, gives unmistakable evidence of being offended." "Mixitli offended? how? how? what is that evi- dence?" exclaimed several Councillors, starting up with looks of surprise and alarm. "A short time ago,:' said the Priest -in reply, " I as- cended to the sacred floor surmounting the solid part of the great Temple, and consecrated to the image of Mixitli and the altars and implements of the worship of the God. As next in rank to the High Priest himself, it is made my duty to visit this holy place every night to see that every- thing is in order, and especially to note the aspects of the image, through which the God has been known on sundry important emergencies to manifest himself to his accepted priests, and to indicate by signs which they only are permitted to understand and interpret, the require- ments of his will. Believing that the present alarming crisis might well furnish one of those emergencies in which the God makes the image his temporary tabernacle, I entered the conse- crated room with trembling reverence and anxiety. I was expecting much in the way of manifestations, but was not prepared for what I then witnessed. I there beheld Tolpan, the High Priest, lying prostrate at the feet of the image, and, throughit, in evident communication with the great dei- ty himself. For awhile he was too much absorbed and agita-   ,  .   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.      105 ted to heed anything around him. But his agitation at length measurably subsiding, he became apprised of my presence, motioned me to his side, and bade me watch and listen. I did so, and soon distinguished strange, low, hollow sounds, which at length rose to distinct outhreaks of what seemed to me to be wrathful mutterings, mingled with the tones of complaint and rebuke, all appearing to issue from the belly of the image, which the next moment began to tremble like a man under the excitement of an- ger that he is unable to suppress. And the High Priest, who then shortly arose, told me that these fearful mani- festations had several times been repeated during the evening." "And how does Tolpan, the High Priest, interpret these mysterious manifestations?" anxiously asked a Councillor. "He did not seem prepared, or else deemed it inexpe- dient to give them a full interpretation," answered the Priest. "He intimated his fears however, that a sacri- lege or some heinous sin against the God must have been either actually committed, or was being meditated by some persons belonging to the city, or more likely, some who have this evening arrived, are conspiring to put down the worship of the God, andset h'i power t Caught. Neither Tolpan or myself haye ever before witnessed suoh marked tokens of displeasure as the, God has this evening 5*  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC8035-00000052"/> 106        CENTEOLA; OR, exhibited; and we think that nothing but the most liberal sacrifices will propitiate him." "' Such sacrifices have already been provided," said the councillor Huasco, " an order has many days since been issued to gather in from the -different tribes a full score of fair virgins; and they are all to be duly sacri- ficed to the god on the second day of the approaching festival. \ "Tolpan well knows that such an order has been issued; and' relying on its faithful execution, he has solemnly promised Mixitli that he would bring that full number of victims to- the altar. But he is fearful that the meas- ure, as wise and imperiously demanded as it is, at this alarming crisis, will be, in part,-at least, defeated. Of the score of virgins ordered not over two thirds of the number have as yet been brought into this city. Some of those who had been marked for the purpose, having been apprised of their selection by traitors, as it is sup- posed, had, when the officers and runners came for them, esBaped into the -forest and were nowhere to be found. Some of them broke away from their keepers after they had been taken, and one, it has been just reported, was Seized and carried off by a monstrous wild beast on the way hither." "But it is too soon to say that all will not yet be made right.

"If we are to believe the accounts we have just received that the enemy are within a day's march of us, who does not see that the city may be assaulted and taken before the hour of the sacrifices, as now appointed, shall arrive? If we are to propitiate the offended God in this manner, at all, it should be done with the least possible delay. I propose, therefore that the sacrifices take place at an early hour to-morrow, or on the first, instead of the last day of the festival." "The Seer has -spoken the words of great wisdom "- warmly responded the councillor Huasco. "The proposi- tion seems to me to come as from the inspiration of a true Seer. I earnestly approve it. Let it be adopted. Let, the time of thJ sacrifices be altered, as he suggests, from the second to the first day of the festival. The urgency of the case demands it. Mixitli may then be propitiated in season for our deliverance. Let the King order the change, and the city may yet be -saved." "I order it - I decree it!" hurriedly exclaimed the King, who appeared eagerly to catch at the measure as  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC8035-00000053"/> 108        CENTEOLA; OR, affording the first gleam of hope that had reached his des- pairing mind," and let the decree be carried into execu- tion.

But where are the rest of the Seers, who have so often of late prophecied to me that the enemy were not to approach the city - why are they silent now. They have said the spirit heavens are so dark that they could not see what is coming. Can they see now? Let them speak." "I see now, and so do I, and I and I," eagerly respon- ded and repeated, one after another, the whole band of Seers. ' Mixitli will be propitiated. He will interpose his power between us and the foe, who will be scattered to the winds. All this is now plainly prefigured in the spirit heavens, as they open to our view. Rejoice! re- joice! the city is saved!" Ay, the city is saved!" echoed the Priests in full chorus. "Especially so, if the God of Hell has his victim the night following the sacrifice to the God of War" inter- posed the persistent priest of the grim deity he represent- ed, " and I earneply recommend that it be so ordered." "I order it then," said the King,!" so that the last ob- stacle to our salvation may be removed." "'Tis done then," "proclaim  it to the people," the   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       109 city is saved! responded the councillors quickly falling in with a measure which .both seers and priests had so E emphatically pronounced the saving one. And the whole assemblage then fell to congratulating each other on what they called the auspicious issue of the debate; when with a feeling of relief, like that of those finding themselves in safety after ffarrowly escaping great danger, they immediately separated, and, rejoicing in their self-delusion, hastened home to spread the good news among the people.  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8035-00000054"/> "O       CENTEOLA; oB, CHAPTER VII. The next morning's sun, as it seemingly rose in blood, looked down upon a deeply disquieted city. For besides the omens of evil, which the earth and heavens combined, in their view, to exhibit, the people had more immediate and tangible cause of alarm. The startling news of the past night, had by this time, spread from mouth to mouth, till the whole population had become apprized of the full extent of the apprehended danger; and great, in conse- quence, was the commotion which now prevailed through every part of the crowded city. Men, with anxious and troubled countenances, were seen hurrying through the streets in all directions; while at every corner small groups of people were gathered, now discussing, in visible agitation, the fearful tidings they had heard, and now speculating on the boding appearance-of the heavens, seeming to take it for granted, that all was referable to one cause, and that all conspired to portend some great and terrible calamity at hand. But at length came the news, that the council, on whom centred the hopes of all for some important and   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       1ll saving action, had, during the night devised measures which were sure to avert the impending evils; when their feelings all seemed to undergo a sudden revulsion, and hope and joy took the place of despondency and fear in every countenance. And when they understood that those measures consisted in propitiating the God of war, who had been discovered to be deeply offended by the irreverence and meditated desecrations of certain persons or parties supposed to be now in the city, by the early sacrifice of the virgins that morning, they became clam- orously impatient for the ceremonies to commence, and went about vowing vengeance on all those, if they could be discovered, who by"' their heresies and impious opposi- tion, had thus offended and estranged the protecting God of the endangered city. But where, in the meantime, was the- young chief Tu- lozin; and how felt he in view of all that had been trans- piring around him?  He had been -no idle observer of what had been passing the preceding night. He had-been to the Council, listened to the discussions -and witnessed what he could no longer conceal from himself was the worse than impotent result, and having there learned, to his great surprise and concern, the circumstances of the bold outrage attempted to be committed on Centeola, he had' left no means untried to trace out and identify the would be perpetrator, and the discoveries he made about that transaction and other scarcely less questionable af- f  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC8035-00000055"/> "2        CENTBOLA; OR, fairs, to which his investigations had led, filled him with grief and amazement. He became convinced that hitherto he had seen only the- surface of sodciety in the Imperial City, while beneath was concealed all manner of vice and corruption, and'to such an extent; he greatly feared as but too well to warrant the -condemnation which the Sage and his daughter had. bestowed on the city. And yet for all his doubts and misgivings, he could not yet decide what part he should take in the coming events of the day. \ He well knew it was expected of him to sustain his rulers in all the measures they had adopted fir the public safety, and at the same time, he knew that should he do so, he must-relinquish all hopes of his idolized Centeola. Could he do that? His heart told him no. And still if he did not so sustain these measures, as wrong and futile as he now began to look upon them, what would be the conse- quences to himself? What, too probably, but to make him an outcast from the high social and political circle, in which he had been so ambitious to move, and cause him to be branded as a traitor. . Such were the questions which passed through his troubled mind, while love was pleading on one side and ambition on the other, and both combining to make him the complete prey of conflicting emotions. While thus disturbed by these distracting reflections, Tulozin, who had been abroad in the city to gather news and learn the state of public feeling, reached his father's   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS..      118 house, resolved thence to repair immediately to the quar- ters of Centeola, to make one effort more to induce her to forego her purpose of publicly declaring her mission be- fore the King and council. which he had now become con- vinced would not only be utterly useless, but would involve her personal safety to a far more dangerous extent than he hadlt first apprehended. But when he reached her, home, a new and unexpected incident occurred, which but added to his doubts and perplexities. The old chief, his father, who had latterly remained mostly at home, taking no part in public affairs, had risen that morning in unusu- al perturbation and alarm. He had been warned, he said, in a dream to depart from the city that morning, as the on- ly way to escape some great evil which was about to be- fal; and he had resolved to obey the Heavenly vision. Finding that no arguments could avail in deterring the old chief from the immediate execution of his purpose, Tuloz- in accompanied him through the western gate of the city, and left him, with a couple of trusty attendants, to set forth, at once, on his journey to his old home among the people of his tribe. Having performed this act of. filial courtesy, Tulozin returned, and, deeply pondering on what he had just heard and seen, which when coupled with the views and predictions of Alcoan and Centeola, gave a new turn to his thoughts, and at the same time filled him with the most painful forebodings, directed his steps, as he had previously purposed, to the quarters of the latter.  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC8035-00000056"/> "4        CENTEOLA; OR, "Tulozin, what of the past night?" anxiously asked the Sage, as the former now made his appearance. "The news of the past night but too well confirms the words of the Sage Alcoan, when we first met yesterday,- and when he predicted that the march of the dread invad- ers would not be stayed. The alarming tidings, indeed, comes, that they are pressing rapidly on directly Awards the city, which, it is feared, they may reach and assault, before another day's sun shall roll over us." "But what of the King and Council? What measures do they depend on now to--save their city?" "On the sacrifices- still wholly on the appointed sac- rifices, the time for which in the pressing emergency they have changed, so that they may take place at the opening of the ceremonies of the Festival this morning; and all are impatient for their rites to commence, that Mix- itli who is reported to be very angry, may be the sooner ap- peased and take sides with us in the impending struggle." "And wist they not that, by the butcheries they call sacrifices, the wrath of the Great God of all may be kindled to a consuming fire against them?" Wist they not in the blindness of their vain and wicked idolatry of their false God, that they are thus but hastening the very doom they are trying to escape? Will they listen to no words of true wisdom?   Will they heed none of the warnings which heaven and earth are combining to give chem?"   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       115 L None, good Alcoan, none, and so intent are they on carrying out what they deem their great saving measure, that they will not even hear the wisdom or expediency of the measure called in question by any; while any words of opposition to its execution will surely bring evil on the heads of those who venture to offer them." "They will, nevertheless, hear such words from Alcoan and Centeola before their wicked and impious designs are consumated. Tulozin, we shall surely this day appear before them." "Your life may be the forfeit. O, do not go, good Alcoan, and especially do not allow Centeola to go. Evil eyes are already upon her, and spies have been watching for you both." "I go; and let them harm the gray-haired old Sage if they deem it will help their cause. He will speak; for he has this day more than one duty to perform. Yes, he will go, but will only answer for one. Centeola can speak for herself. We will summon her to appear." The Sage then rapped several times with his staff on the table; and in obedience to the well understood sum- mons; the maiden promptly made her appearance in the room. "Tulozin is welcome " she said with a sweet smile and in tones of respectful tenderness, " and all the more cor.. dially does Centeola thus greet him; because she is well aware of all the kind offices he performed in her behalf during the troublous scenes of the past night."  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC8035-00000057"/> "6        CENTEOLA; OR, "If Centeola knows that, she may also be aware, per- haps of the snares that are set for her on every side in this, to her, dangerous city, and she further may well be- lieve that the object of her coming here, and that of A1- coan and their train, is more than suspected; and that it is the secret determination of some of the most influential of those in power and the official instruments of their will, to thwart their purposes, and to punish those, I greatly fear, who shall attempt to execute them." "From what she has heard and noted, the past night, Centeola is not wholly unprepared for Tulozin's announce- ment." "O, why, then, will she not listen to his voice and be warned not to appear in public as she proposes, and brave those who have the power to bring her and her father to much harm?"

It must be so; --yes fair and gifted one it must be so." "It is so. Tulozin reasons rightly. But is that Su- preme God a good and consistent deity, or a malign and inconsistent one?" "I should think a good and consistent one." "Would he, then, destroy or mar what'he has created, whether it be the orbs of heaven or the children of men?

Tulozin is still right; for his desire to be right, and his clear mind, will not permit him to reason otherwise than he does. But if the God, of whom we speak, is supreme and benevolent, as Tulozin now admits, will he suffer, with impunity, the'earthly children of his care and regard to be put to death to please aninferior deity, if, as you seem to have supposed, such a deity exists in your so called God of war, and even will he hold  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC8035-00000058"/> "8      -  CENTEOLA; OR, blameless those who stand coldly by and utter no word in remonstrance-of such murderous proceedings?"  The young chief stood mute for he disdained to, an- swer evasively; and he plainly perceived that to answer as he might reasonably be expected after the admissions he had made, would imply the duty, on his part, to take an open stand in opposition to the decrees of the Council, a step which he yet greatly hesitated about taking, and the Sage readily comprehending the cause of his hesita- tion, interposed to take up the discourse. ' Tulozin does not answer, because he cannot yet bring himself to fear men less than IIim who created them, and moulds them to his will -because he does not fully com- prehend the providence of that great and good Being- because he does not see, that if God would protect the good among his earthly children, he must punish the bad, or those who commit wrongs and outrages upon them; and finally because he does not yet fully know and realize the 'manifold wickedness of this city, and that its crowning abomination is the sacrifice of innocent human beings to the false gods it has set up for its vain and abhorrent wor- ship. For years, Tulozin, I have watched the growing sins of this place, and the foul wrongs which the exacting and luxurious rulers, and the corrupt nobles have been heaping on the people of the'seven tribes.

Many of the fairest-of our virgins have been tempted or stolen away from their homes, and brought here to be corrupted and made to min- ister to the base passions of the rulers and nobles, and to support those rulers and nobles in their luxury and idle- ness, tribute upon tribute is yearly wrung from all the tribes till they have become an impoverished and discour- aged people; while spies have been sent swarming over the land, to report the names of those found uttering complaints, and mark them for punishment.  Now does Tulozin believe that a sin-hating and just God will long suffer such a city to go unpunished without thorough re- pentance and reformation?" I hardly know what to believe, good Alcoan. But I will confess, that, even as little as I have been admitted to a knowledge of the secret doings of those who control here, I have seen many things which have filled me with pain and surprise, and these, with the still more painful discoveries of the past night, lead me to' feat, that too much of what Alcoan has said cannot be easily gainsayed  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8035-00000059"/> 120        CENTEOLA; ORO ' But how, if I should attempt-it, could I make the doers of the evil repent and change their ways?

" It may be as thou sayest, good Alcoan, and it may be that there are duties for me, which I shall soon see my way clear to perform.

We would have thee do what that teach- es thee is right, and leave the result to the wise ordering of the Great Spirit, who can and will protect thee in the honest course, and at-the same time grant thee the favor which is worth more than all that king or council can ever bestow.

Instead of responding directly, the young chief after a thoughtful pause, related the 'singular circumstances at- tending the departure of his father, the old chief of the Buffalos, early that morning, of which the solemn assev- erations of Centeola and the Sage appeared to remind him, and concluded by proposing that they should all ab- stain from attending the festival, and following the exam- ple of the old chief, immediately leave the -city together.

The hour of trial, and, with it, the hour of retribution, was at hand. With feelings of intense solicitude, indeed, but with no weak relentings, no touch of fear or irresolu- tion, Alcoan and his gifted and heroic daughter sum- moned their attendants, and, with them, set forth for the scene of action for that memorable day. As in the order and manner of their march yesterday, Centeola rode on her beautiful white steed. By her side walked Alcoan with the peculiar oaken staff generally carried by Sages, symbolizing, in this instance, his tribe by being carved in the shape of a serpent. In their rear followed the attend- ant maidens, and then all the men, except Wampa, who, from his great strength and resolution, was placed in front to take the lead and clear the way for the cortege through the crowded streets. Scarcely had they left their quarters before they perceived that they were the objects of gener- al observation and scrutiny among the multitude. As they proceeded along the narrow street, in which they had set forth, throngs of people were continually rushing by them, or running along by their side, eagerly scanning  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8035-00000061"/> 124        IOENTIOLA; on, the appearance of the whole company; while Centeola and her horse appeared especially to attract their atten- tion, and elicit their surprise. And when they reached the great street leading down fi'om the Western gate, the crowd became an almost compact mass of living bodies, all pressing eagerly forward towards the Sacred Inclosure, which was evidently the great point of attraction for the day. As the train reached this point, it was com- pelled to come to a stand;: for, at first they found it im- possible to find a sufficient space among the moving mass to enable them to fall in and move along with the current. In a few minutes, however, they were relieved from their dilemma in the most unexpected manner: for,- at this juncture, their ears were saluted by the loud cries of her- alds, who came rushing down the street, brandishing their long spears, and sternly ordering the crowd to fall back on either side, to make room for the "Procession of the Sacred Viryins" which was proclaimed to be approaching. This procession was regarded as one of the most interest- ing and important of all the ceremonies of the Great Festival of theGod of War, for whose honor it was es- pecially designed. Previous to the day of the Festival, it was customary for a select band of girls, who thereby obtained the appellation of the Sacred Virgins, to fashion, -or construct. from the flour of maize and wild rice, mixed with honey and the pulp of fruits, an idol representing the God of War, and clothe and deck it out in costly at-   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.      125 tire with a variety of mystic devices. And this figure on the first morning of the Festival was placed sitting up- right on a litter, and borne in solemn procession through the principal streets of the city, immediately attended by those particularly designated as the Sacred Virgins, followed by a long and splendid array of young girls, dressed in white and adorned with a -profusion of the most beautiful flowers it was possible to obtain. After mov- ing through the streets in this manner, this showy cor- tege always proceeded directly to the Sacred Enclosure, there, in front of the Great Temple, to inaugurate the opening ceremony of the Festival.- In the present in- stance the procession, having already made their customa- ry rounds through the streets,- was on its way to its final destination. In a few minutes after it had been announced and the way opened for it, as above described, the heralded proces- sion came sweeping by amidst the loud beating of drums and the reiterated cheers and shouts of the excited multi- tude.  Falling in directly in the rear of this procession, the Sage, his daughter and their train, with Wampa in front, and Tulozin, who had now overtaken them, follow- ing closely behind them, were hurried rapidly along with the great human tide, unquestioned and almost unnoticed in the general rush, till they had entered the Sacred Enclos- ure. Here on a slightly raised, broad platform extending along in front of the Council Hall, sat the King in his royal  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8035-00000062"/> 126         CENTEOLA; OR, robes, and his Councillors, together with the Priests, Seers and attendant state officials, all showily attired for the oc- casion. On the opposite side of the street, and close to the foot of the Great Temple, had been erected another, much smaller, but more elevated platform, which was principally occupied by a vacant throne, designed for the High Priest of the Temple, who was now reserving his presence for the most important ceremony of the day. As the procession of the Sacred Virgins passed between these two platforms, and, according to custom, there came -to a halt facing the King, Centeola's party, having just before partially extricated themselves from the mid- current of the rushing throng, were pressed and crowded up close to the end of the King's platform, where, hedged in on every side, and,thus involuntarily brought to a stand, they b1ecame involuntary spectators of all that transpired. The image, which had been borne forward at the head of the procession, was now, with great formality brought upon the platform and presented to the King, who, in turn ordered it to be delivered over to the priests of- Mixi- tli; when it was at once taken in hand by them, broken into small fragments and distributed to the crowd, by whom it was received with shouts of exultation and eagerly eaten, each repeating-" thus we eat the body of the God, and thus we shall be made strong tofight his bat' tles, and to scatter our own foes." As soon as this ceremony was concluded, the Sacred   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.      127 Virgins retired to make room for other and less important rites, (such as oblations of fruits, flowers, birds and small quadrupeds, to the sun. the moon and some of the subor- dinate acknowledged deities,) which had been usually made to follow the one that had just taken place. But all these lighter sacred rites and displays, were lost sight of by the multitude in their anxiety for the speedy occur- rence of the doubly important chief ceremony of the Fes- tival. And the loud and prolonged cries of "the Sacri- fices! the Sacrifices of the virgins!" rose from every quarter of the densely crowded Sacred Arena, till the thousand times repeated demand filled the heavens with vociferous clamor; while the lively commotion and the surging to and fro of the vast throng, with other demon- strations of their eagerness, plainly testified their angry impatience at every moment's delay in complying with their request.  The King then rose, and, waving his official wand to- wards the crowd in order to impose silence, thus addressed, the people - "It has always been our custom to reserve the cereno- ny of the human Sacrifices, so important for propitiating the protecting deity of our nation, to the last; so as to make a fitting close of the glorious Festival we have so long and wisely yearly held in his honor. But inasmuch as our city, and with it the whole nation, is so immediately threatened by a formidable foe, and as we need the speedy s  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8035-00000063"/> 128        CENTEOLA; OR, interposition of-our all potent God, we last night decreed the sacrifices should take place early on this, the first day of the Festival, and as soon as the less important ceremo- nies which have ever been permitted to follow the beauti- ful rite we have just witnessed, are over, the Sacrifices of the Virgins shall immediately proceed." But the- temper of the crowd, goaded almost to mad- ness, as they were, at the thought of the so nearly threat- ening danger, would brook no delay, and the eager cry was again raised, " the Sacrifices! the Sacrifices! The God is angry and must be immediately appeased. Let the King permit no delay! The Sacrifices! the Sacrifi- ces!" And as if to make good the assertion of the anger of the God by a visible- demonstration, as first uttered, at that moment a strange, deep, rumbling sound was heard, and the earth shook and vibrated too palpably not to arrest in- stant attention. All stood aghast, and were struck dumb with surprise and apprehension; while the King and his Councillors exchanged glances of lively concern. A dead pause succeeded ; when- the crowd rallying from their sur- prise, and now being joined by the whole band of Priests and Seers, fiercely broke forth anew with the loud and united cry of, s' the Sacrifices! the Sacrifices!' with an earnest- ness and determination that plainly evinced they would brook no futher delay or opposition. The King, therefore, after a hurried consultation with some of the leading Councillors, rose and said -   THE MAID- OF THE MOUNDS.       129 "The wishes of the people shall be heeded. Let the virgins, who have been consecrated to the God of War, be brought forth and prepared for the final ceremony." In a short time the doomed virgins, heralded by a band of six subordinate Priests, and enclosed on every side by armed guards, were led forth from their prison chamber, opening from one side of the Great Temple, and arranged in, front of the smaller platform beneath it. By the des- perate exertion of the 'King's emissaries, all but one of the required twenty virgins, had during the night, been brought in;' and it was announced by one of the priests that the hunt was still going on for the victim still want- ing to make up the full score that had been decreed to the God.' And here they stood in all?the bloom of their youth and beauty passively but fearfully awaiting their dreaded fate. Not the first ray of hope lighted a single countenance, but the looks of all were deeply stamped' with the most painful expressions of anguish and despair; while convulsive sobs and half suppressed cries of mortal terror were often bursting from their pallid lips. A large basket of garlands and flower wreaths was now borne for- ward by the servants of the Priests, who, having severally selected their portions of- these flowery ornaments, pro- ceeded to deck with them the heads and necks of the de- voted band. When they had been thus arrayed, a Priest formally addressed the -poor trembling creatures, telling them how proud and happy they should feel in the. honor 6*  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC8035-00000064"/> 180         CENTEOLA; OR, of being thus selected to propitiate the God of War, and assuring. them that they should be all immediately trans- lated to the :House of the Sun,; where they would lead lives of endless delight, hailing that luminary in the morn- ing with music and dancing, when, as he mounted upward on his glorious course through the sky, they would be joined by the innumerable souls of young warriors slain in battle, and all would attend him with similar festivities to the place of his sitting. These ceremonies being over, the King arose and wav- ing his royal wand towards the multitude, announced that the all important rites were then about to be commenced, and enjoined on all to witness them with devout attention, and with earnest secret prayers to the God, that he would graeioasly accept the oblation, become propitiated, and in- terpose his potent arm and save the city from the dread- ed foe. Loud and prolonged exclamations in approval of this address every, where burst forth from the multitudes. Theun 4 pause and momentary silence ensued, during which, the clear flute-like tones of the voice of Centeola 'ose melodiously and solemnly on the air, causing thou- sands of faces to turn in surprise towards the spot from which such unwonted accents had proceeded, when with still greater surprise, their eyes fell upon the transcen- dent form and face of the gifted maiden, speaking from her spotless white steed, which, now for the first time at-   THE- 'MAT OF THE MOUNDS.      131 tracting their attention and obviously greatly increased the curiosity and wonder of the throng, who becoming hushed into silence, were eagerly intent on catching the words she might be uttering. "King of the Imperial City," she began, "I this hour appear before thee on a mission, which has been prompted by the Great Spirit, the Supreme God whom I alone wor- ship, and sanctioned by a large class of the best and most enlightened of your subjects of the Seven. Tribes. In that great name, and in the name of those dutiful sub- jects, I come to protest against the inhuman sacrifices of these innocent virgins - I come." ,Who is it, who dares thus to question and oppose the decrees of the King and Council?' exclaimed a Council- lor starting to his feet with looks of angry excitement. "Away with her! away with her!" shouted the priests. "No, no! It is something more than a woman--it surely must be a goddess!" cried a dozen voices from. the fickle crowd, who were evidently struck with --wonder at the marvellous beauty of the maiden, at the richness of her costume, and at the, to them, strange and imposing animal on which she sat, and which, by many of them, was taken as part of herself,- "it is a goddess. come among us! Let her not be driven away, let her be heard."

They are proposed to be made to propitiate a God, if such a God there be, who has no power over the affairs of men. They are therefore in vain, and worse than in vain; for they will surely call down the wrath of the Great-God of Heaven and Earth on thee and thy corrupt and idolatrous city. They will bring upon thee, thy city, and all our beloved Azatlan, the very doom thou art vain- ly thinking to avert by these unhallowed rites and cere- monies. Release then, these poor trembling victims of wrong and superstition, forego the whole system of hu- man sacrifices, and repent thy Heaven-offending purpose; and it may be that the Good Supreme, in his mercy, will yet spare and punish not. But if not, if this great wickedness is consummated, I prophecy that the doom of this proud city, and, with it, this dynasty, is sealed for- ever. I see the avenging bolt suspended over us in the heavens above, and I hear the deep mutterings of the coming wrath in the earth beneath. -Be warned then, 0 King and Councillors, in season, Stay the sacrifices and hope to live - persist in them and perish." This address was hailed by a howl of wrath from the united vociferations of the Priests and Seers, in which could be distinguished the fierce demands -   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       133 - c Away with her! she blasphemes the God! she defies the King! -away with her to the deepest dungeon in the Temple!" A half dozen excited Councillors sprang to their feet; but before they could be heard, the great drum sent forth its deep, rolling notes from the temple above, to announce that the High Priest, the great master of the ceremonies at hand, has issued from his palace and was, with his re- tinue on his way to the scene of action. Instantly the whole crowd was thrown into commotion'; and from every quarter loud rose the commingling shouts and exclama- tions- "Tolpan, the High Priest! The High Priest is com- ing! Clear the way for the High Priest!'  All eyes were turned in the direction indicated by these clamorous demonstrations; when, through the long vista made by the dividing ranks of the heaving masses along the way, the august personage in question, -'gorgeously ar- rayed, and in a gilded chair, borne on the shoulders of four liveried serving men, was seen slowly advancing be- tween the two living walls of the compressed throng, num- bers of whom were abjectly prostrating themselves before one who was supposed 'to become invested for the time being, with all the attributes of the God of War himself, and, therefore, equally entitled to the same worship. So strongly indeed had this notion been impressed on the minds of the people by the priesthood and Seers, and tac-  b  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC8035-00000066"/> 184        CENTEOLA; OR, itly sanctioned by the rulers, that whatever the High Priest ordered or did, on such 'occasions, was never al- lowed to be countermanded, or questioned even by the King himself. As the High Priest, in his conspicuous seat, drew near, he was seen by the motioris he was making with his sacred staff to his bearers, to be so directing his course as to bring him directly to the place occupied by Centeola and her party at one end of the platform, on which sat the King and Council. Nearer and nearer- came the vehicle with- its sacred freight, till it was at length brought to a stand directly by the side of the horse, on which Centeola was sitting, her guards on that side having been rudely borne back and separated from her by the tremendous press of the rushing crowd. "Maiden," said the High Priest, touching her on the shoulder with his staff, and speaking in a low tone, intend- ed to reach no other ear but hers, -, maiden turn and hear me." Centeola, wholly unprepared for being thus addressed, suddenly turned her head round to the speaker; when to her utter astonishment, she beheld, in the/High Priest, no other than the sinister-eyed emissary who had insulted her at her father's lodge and renewed his infamous perse- cutions at her quarters in the city the preceding evening. She recoiled at the discovery, but lost not her self posses- sion; while the object of her loathing indignation re- sumed- a    A     *    THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.      135 - "I well know thy purpose in appearing here, and now know from what has been told me on my way hither, and from what I read in the angry looks of all around me, in what manner thou hast declared it.

But even now, listen to what I last night proposed and thou shalt be saved. Wilt thou yield?" "No! I then gave thee my answer; and I now re- peat it in the face of all thy detestable menaces.

Instantly free me from thy hated presence!" The last words of the indignant maiden were uttered so loud that they were heard, not only by the King and Council, but a large portion of the surrounding multitude who, in conjunction with the Priests and Seers quickly raised the shout -- "She is audaciously reviling the High Priest, while he  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC8035-00000067"/> 136        CENTEOA; OR, is mercifully trying to reclaim her!

Though burning with suppressed wrath, the High Priest, the better to subserve his inifamous purpose which even now he resolved not to yield, controlled his passion, and moving to the consecrated chair, which as before stat- ed had been placed for him on a small, elevated platform erected at the foot of the Temple, glanced around on the hushed multitudes with unruffled looks, intended to ex- hibit to them his equanimity and forbearance; when wav- ing his sacred staff to attract and command their attention, he loudly ordered his assistants to prepare for the imme- diate commencement of the sacrifices fully/believing that the witnessing of the dreadful deaths of so many of her sex would cause the obdurate maiden to relent and beg for the mercy which, on one condition, he was still ready to grant her   :   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       187 CHAPTER IX. The awful rites of sacrificing human beings to false gods having been thus inaugurated, and ordered to be im- . mediately commenced, the devoted virgins, two by two, led by a priest and enclosed by files of guards, armed with short, sharp lances, were now put in motion, and  goaded and forced along up the broad stair-way winding round the outside to the top of the Temple, where the altar, or sacrificial stone stood ready prepared for the ab- horrent immolation. The stairway wound three times completely round the tall structure in its course upward, and every time the mournful train came round fronting the crowd, their ears were saluted by the fresh bursts of the wails of sorrow and despair from these hapless vic- tims of superstition and cruelty. At length they all reached the consecrated area on the summit; when the devoted innocents were ranged in a"circular row in front of the bloody altar, to await, in turn, their respective dooms. The great drum then again sounded to betoken that all was ready; when the High Priest, amidst the cheers and shouts of the multitude; slowly ascended the  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC8035-00000068"/> 138       v CENTEOLA; OR, stairs, and at length his diminished form was seen entering the sacred area, where his presence was awaited to super- intend the ceremony at hand. For a moment, there was a dead silence above; and- the whole vast throng stood hushed in mute expectation below. Then a sharp, wild shriek from above, quickly followed by a succession of less audible cries, apprised all of the fact, that a victim had been seized, thrown prostrate over the sacrifical stone, her neck confined down by a yoke or fork made for the purpose, and her breast laid bare for the fatal blow. At the tap on the great drum, a Priest, called the Chief Sacrificer, approached and plunged his knife deep into the vitals of the victim, who, with one long cry of mortal agony, subsiding into a gurgling groan, yielded up her life forever. The sacrificer then ripped open the quiver- ing breast of the bleeding victim, tore out her heart and threw it down at the feet ef the grim image of the God, to whom the horrid oblation was made; when the High Priest loudly exclaimed, "Accept this, our willing sacrifice, O, Mixitli, forgive our offences, and interpose thy mighty arm for the salva- tion of our imperilled city t!  After this the mutilated body was caught up by two of the attendant Priests, borne to the battlement and hurled down from the dizzy height to the ground below. A loud shout of exultation, the next instant rose from the excited multitude, the nearest of whom eagerly fell on the body   THE MAID OF TIlE MOUNDS.      189 with knives, cut it up in small pieces, and distributed it to those around them, amidst the furious beating of drums and tymbals, which, mingling with the fresh outhursts of human voices, made the heavens resound with the wild uproar. And thus, for the next two hours, proceeded this cere- mony of accumulating horrors, as victim after victim was successively thrown on the gory altar, received the fatal plunge of the knife, uttered her last death scream, and her remains, torn, mangled and streaming with blood, sent flying over the battlement to the ground below. But as horrible as were these infernal rites, they were witnessed throughout with the most manifest gratification by the whole populace, who, at the close of each individu- al sacrifice, as practically announced by the swift descend- ing corpse to the ground, testified their delight in the most wild and jubilant acclamations. After the last of the nineteen victims had been des- --patched, the High Priest followed by his subordinates, de- scended the stairway and took his seat in the sacred chair directly facing the Royal platform, and very near Cen- teola and her train. The crowd for the moment were hushed to silence; and all eyes were turned upon him to hear what might next proceed from his oracular lips, and see what might be his next movement. For some time, however, he remained mute, expecting every moment to hear the fair object of his infamous machinations, who  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC8035-00000069"/> "O    '    CENTEOLA; OR, still sat calmly on her horse with looks of pain and sor- row at the .sceries she had just witnessed, now raise her voice in recantation of what she had uttered, and in hum- ble petitions to the King and to himself for pardon and mercy. But soon growing impatient at her persistent si- lence; he turned on her a prolonged, scrutinizing and sig- nificant look of inquiry. But instead of the expected re- sponse of relenting and kind expressions of countenance, he found himself defiantly confronted by the now doubly indignant maiden, and his unhallowed glances met with a - look of scorn which he could be at no further loss how to interpret, and which seemed instantly to fill him with the deepest, though smothered resentment. He was evidently conceiving a plan of the most dastardly and deadly revenge, and accordingly, he soon arose, and, with a voice tremu- lous with passion, which was attributed by the specta- tors to the intensity of his holy emotions, turned to the King and said-- "We have anxiously endeavored, Q King, to make an acceptable and sufficient sacrifice. But the Great Mixi- tli, on whose interposition the safety of the Imperial city depends, is not yet satisfied. One full score of fair vir- gins were decreed him for a sacrifice on this great occa- sion. One is still lacking. It is in vain we have tried to make him content short of the full- number. The God can- not, and will not be cheated. The lacking victim must be immediately supplied."          . '   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.      141 "Ay, ay!" eagerly responded the subservient Priests and Seers of every grade. "Let a victim be at once se- lected and brought forth."  "And let her," resumed the High Priest, growing more decided by the support thus received, "Let her be more beautiful than any of those who have been already devoted to the God. as it will be but a suitable amend-to the offended deity. But who shall she be?" he added glancing significantly to Centoola. The crowd instantly comprehending the malicious indi- cation; and seeing in it the sanction for carrying out, and more than carrying out their late demand of seizing and imprisoning the maiden, instantly extended their scores of ,menacing fingers towards her and fiercely exclaimed,- "There she is! there is the one! She, who, an hour ago, insulted the God, and audaciously put herself in op- position to the doings and authority of the King and Coun- cil. Let her be the one. Let her at once be delivered over to the Priests." A great commotion now immediately ensued among the multitude; and even the King and Council evidently shared in the general sensation. But surprise at the course things appeared to be taking, together with some freshy springing doubts on the unexpected proposition combined to keep the latter silent. Centeola was known to several of the Council, from her first appearance before- them, to belong to a noble family of one of the most pow-  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC8035-00000070"/> -142        CENTEOLA; OR, erful of the tribes, and these soon whispered the fact to the rest. This had restrained them from joining in the out- side clamor for her arrest; since, by an established law of the nation, the, persons of nobles and their families were exempted from seizure and imprisonment, except for murder and one or two infamous crimes, none of which, could it be pretended, she had committed, and much less was it deemed permissible, that the daughter of a no- ble should ever be made the victim of a sacrifice. The King and Council, therefore, remained silent, knowing not what to say or do, in their surprise and perplexity. The High Priest, however, burning to revenge himself for the mortifying repulse he had received in the prosecution of his base designs, was not to be restrained from his pres- ent deadly purpose by any such scruples, apd custom hav- ing made him supreme in all that pertained to the sacrifi- ces, he determined that nothing should prevent him from carrying that purpose into execution. But for his own safety he preferred to shoulder the responsibility on the people, and through them secure, at least, the acquies- sence of the King and Council. In accordance with his plan, he rose, and, with an assumed air of dignified calm- ness and deliberation, slowly and with solemn emphasis, proceeded. '"The people have willed it. - They have pointed out the'virgin here present whom they deem the proper vic- tim, and persist in their demand to have her taken for the   -  THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.      143 required sacrifice. And why should not their voices be obeyed-? What victim could be offered to the God that could so well appease and gratify him as one who has re- viled him and set his power at naught, as yon maiden has this day done in the presence of the King, and before all the assembled people? H repeat, then, why should not she be the one to be selected for the purpose?  "t I will tell thee " here promptly interposed the hither- to silent Sage Alcoan, in a voice of startling energy -"I will tell thee, proud Priest, why this exalted maiden may not be made a victim. If. as thou sayest, the people have willed it, it is in their ignorance that they have done it. By the laws and customs of this nation, the. nobles, and the daughters of the nobles, are exempt from seizure and sacrifice. It is Alcoan, the Sage of the Feathered Ser- pents who tells thee this - who is himself of noble blood, and knows this maiden to be no less so." The Councillor Huasco, who had before shown himself a subservient tool of the High Priest, now, on receiving a secret sign from the latter, hastily rose, and by way of coming to the rescue, authoritively exclaimed - "She is. not his daughter. He dare not assert that she is his daughter." "A conspiracy! Behold the conspiracy!" cried the High Priest. "She is not his daughter; and he is try- ing to shield her by claiming her, as such, to be the daughter of a noble! Shall we suffer the sacred rights  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC8035-00000071"/> "4        CENTEOLA; OR, of the God to be thus trifled with? Never! Then let her be briought forth." ,i Stay, thou remorseless Priest!" exclaimed Alcoan, "I know thy motives, but thou shalt yet be baffled in thy unholy purposes. I appeal to the King and Council. Shall a noble, as they all know me to be, fail to be allowed a hearing?" The King betrayed tokens of perplexity and indecision, and became visibly agitated. But finding that a response was expected of him, he hurriedly consulted with two or three Councillors sitting nearest to him ; after which; with a deprecating glance to the High Priest, he hesitatingly said, "The Sage of the Feathered Serpents is certainly a noble; and, as it can be no interference with the preroga- tivesof the High Priest to allow him at least a hearing. He is permitted to speak; what would he say?" L"In the first place," firmly replied Alcoan, "I would repeat in this presence every assertion I have made re- specting this maiden, of whom I stand the protector. She is not my daughter by blood, it is true, and for all that she is the lawful offspring of a noble, and of one too, far higher in his exalted rank, than the highest nobles now sitting before me as Councillors." "What meanest thou, Alcoan?" exclaimed the King, starting up in singular perturbation. 'Explain-ex- plain thy words of mystery." -   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       145 "I obey," promptly responded the Sage. "I will ful- ly reply to thy request: For I perceive that the time has arrived when the great - secret, of which I, among all thy living, probably, am alone master, should be unfolded. ' Thou, O King, hadst once a wife, most fair to look up- on and gracedcwith every virtue. She died, having borne thee a daughter as lovely as herself. Thou didst then take unto thee another wife, who was as evil of--heart as the first one was good. She also soon bore thee a daugh- ter, that was not fair; and the heart of the evil mother sickened with envy and spite, as she compared her plain offspring with the beautiful child of the former wife, and she conspired with the nurse of that motherless child to cause it to be carried out of the city and slain. But the nurse relented and employed a confidant to carry it away to a distance and leave it secretly at some lodge door, where its origin would never be known; while -she re- turned and reported that the child had been seized and devoured by a wild beast. That child was left at my door, taken in and tenderly cared for. It had certain marks on its inner dress, and-a silver amulet around its neck, which gave a direct clue to its origin, and which, for months, I industriously but secretly followed up, until all was unmistakably revealed. But I deemed it prudent to keep the secret of the little castaway to myself, and reared and adopted her as my daughter. Here, O King, is that silver amulet, marked with thy royal eagle and a     7    &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC8035-00000072"/> "6         - CENTEOLA j OR, crown, such as thou well knowest, none but the children of the King are ever permitted to wear." The King, as the Sage proceeded, had become more and more agitated, until he trembled and shook in his seat, like the aspen in the wind. Iye seemed from first, to have had a presentiment of what was coming; and conscience, that unescapable chastiser of the wicked, wag busy in bringing up in review before his shrinking mind, the long catalogue of the wrongs he had inflicted on his people, and of the vices and crimes that had marked his dissolute and corrupt career, and especially of his acquiescence, after discovering the fact as he soon did, in the supposed murder of his child, which he felt to be the most heinous of all his offences. And thus it is ever among men, that through this remarkable principle, which Providence has implanted in the heart, no crime, however secret, can ever long be exempted from the punishment which this inward Nemesis is sure to inflict on the- perpetrator by making for him a life of misery here, or a hell hereafter. Scarcely had the Sage named, and held up the token found on the child to the view of the King, before he, wanting no other confirmation of the truth of the. start- ling disclosure just made, leaped in terrible agitation to his feet, and, in tones rising almost to a screech of fienzy, exclaimed, "What became of that child,? speak!' speak! where is she now-?"   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       147 '(There, O King! replied Alcoan, proudly pointing to Centeolh, who appeared no less surprised than the King at the development, " there she sits in all her purity and beauty. She is truly thine own daughter, O Iing, and, since thou art bereft of other heirs, the rightfulasuccessor to the Royal throne of the whole of the broad domains of our beloved Azatlan.9' "I know it, I have' felt it!" gasped the feeble and chattered old King, in tones of strangely mingled joy and distress, as he sank back into his seat under the force of his overpowering emotions, while the Council, Priests, Seers and all the throng around, were thrown into the deepest commotion. But over all the noise and confusion, soon rose the shrill voice of the High Priest, who, besides the danger of being balked in his purpose of encompassing the mai- den's death, both out of revenge and the fear of her expos- ing his iniquities, at once foresaw, that if Alcoan's story was true, his own doom, after what had occurred, was in- evitable, and who, therefore, was impelled to the most desperate exertions for the success of .his murderous scheme. "It is false!" he frantically exclaimed. "It is the fabrication of a traitor to shield a base and impious trai- tress. They are both traitors to the King and revilers of the God. But all -their falsehoods and deceitful de- vices shall not avail them. I have solemnly vowea the  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC8035-00000073"/> "8        CENTEOLA; ORB maiden to Mixitli. And as I have the power which the King himself cannot dispute, I order her to be seized and brought forward for, the sacrifice. Advance then, guards, sieze her instantly. In the name of the great God of War, I command it!" In obedience to this fierce and imperative command, which none dare disobey, a half dozen of the Priests and guards sprang forward, and, with arms extended for the grasp, had nearly reached Centeola; when their advance was suddenly arrested by Tulozin, who with a heavy war club, bounded out from his unnoticed position among the maiden's attendants, where he had been anxiously watch- ing the progress of events, and with one powerful sweep brought several of the foremost of the assailants to the ground, and caused the rest to retreat in disorder and alarm. "Mutiny! treason!" shouted the Councillor Huasco. "Mutiny! Treason! Sacrilege!" screamed the High Priest; while every lower Priest arid Seer quickly echoed the cry. "Let the audacious traitor, who has thus as- sailed the sacred guards, be overpowered, and especially let the impious maiden be at once secured. Guards, hes- itate at your peril!" The guards now strongly reinforced, made a new and desperate rush upon the gallant young chief who now in spite of his sturdy and disabling blows, was driven from the side of the maiden, and the now unchecked assailants   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       149 were again on the point of seizing her when they were again brought to a pause by the sharp, cracked voice of the troubled old King, who piteously exclaimed - u Desist there, guards! Spare, O spare my daugh- ter!" t' Spare her not," cried the High Priest, fuming with rage. "I will not, yield my rightful authority. The King is deceived and betrayed. Heed him not; and in- stantly sieze that reviler of the God. I again com- mand it; and the curse of the God be on the head of every one who shall this time refuse to obey me." On hearing this command backed as it was with the terrible imprecation that accompanied it, the whole body of the guards, with the assistant Priests, made towards Centeola a rush against which the arm of Tulozin could not be expected to prevail. But an arm mightier than his was about to interpose to save the maiden from her men- aced doom. At that instant an explosion, louder than the loudest thunder, burst from the ground at the very feet of the ad- vancing assailants, filling the air with dust and sulphur- ous smoke, disclosing a long opening rent in the earth, causing the solid structures around to shake and topple, and striking the whole assemblage dumb with consternas- tion and dismay. "Tulozin, our mission is ended," exclaimed Centeola, turning to the young chief, who had sprung to her side.  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC8035-00000074"/> 150        CENTEOLA; OR, "We must instantly be gone. Lead the way to the west- ern gate of the city. The doom of Heaven is about to fall on this den of iniquity. Haste thee, haste, brave Tulozin, lest We perish with them." Taking instant advantage of the wild confusion that reigned everywhere around, the young chief promptly cleared a passage through the bewildered, and no longer resisting crowd, and, before either Council, Priests, or the general- throng, had rallied from their amazement, and collected their senses. Centeola, her father, and their whole train, led by Tulozin, and closely tfollowed by the strong armed Wampa, had disappeared from the Sacred Enclosure, and were well on their way out of the city.   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       151 CHAPTER X. Vain would be the attempt to describe the scene of commotion and alarm that ensued among all ranks, both of the magnates, and the people of the Imperial city, at the fearful, and todthem in a country where earthquakes and volcanoes were unknown, incomprehensible phenome- na they had just witnessed. The dense and deeply agi- tated living masses thronging the Sacred Enclosure, rush- ing hither and thither in their overpowering consternation and dismay, were seen everywhere swaying and, surging over and around the whole extended area, like the cross- waves of the ocean in a suddenly smiting tempest, mad- dened by the blind impulse to escape, and thus heedlessly trampling hundreds to death beneath their feet; while the mingling cries and groans of the wounded and dying, the shrieks of affright, and the eagerly uttered prayers to the Gods for deliverance from the something terrible at -hand, though they scarcely knew what, filled the air with the wildest uproar and tumult. The High Priest, though at first as much astonished and dismayed as the rest, was yet not long in regaining  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8035-00000075"/> 152        CENTEOLA6 OR,   G sufficient composure for taking some definite action. The maddening thought of the life-or-death issue, which he well knew he had now at stake, quickly restored him to the full use of all his fiendish faculties. With the lifting of the cloud of dust and smoke, that had filled the air, it was his first care to peer forward to the spot recently oc- cupied by his intended victim and her party. And the *instant he discovered their escape, he hastily called sever- al of his swiftest runners to his side and promptly dis- patched them to close all the gates of the city, and to see that they were securely guarded. He then sent different bands of armed warriors to pur- sue, intercept, and bring back the fugitives. And this done, he arose and in a loud voice commanded the atten- tion of the people. ",Let no one be alarmed," he said, schooling his fea- tures and voice into looks and tones deemed best calcula- ted for effect. "It was but a clap of .thunder coming from yon cloud," he continued pointing to the dust and smoke-cloud that had, by this time, risen above the city, "Yes, only that; and yet it is a thing to be heed- ed.  It is to be taken as a token of displeasure of the God.  It was in fact the voice of the Great Mixitli speaking to us. He had become impatient at our hesita- tion and delay in rendering up for his altar the victim that had been vowed to him. We have incurred a very great peril in thus trifling with the God. But I have   TFE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.      153 taken prompt measures to avert the consequences. Though; as you see, the perverse victim and her traitorous band, as I am prepared to show them to be, have escaped from the Sacred Enclosure, they have not escaped from the city. Means have been taken to intercept them; and they will soon be brought back. Peace, then, ye people! The God shall be shortly avenged; and then He will again smile on us, and save us from every danger. We will now return to Centeola and her fugitive train. For the first few furlongs, after clearing the Sacred En- closure, they found the great street so emptied in conse- quence of the general rush of the people to the scene of the sacrifices, that they encountered few obstacles to pre- vent them from making their way with all desired rapidi- ty through the usually thronged street leading to the western gate; and they began to congratulate themselves on the prospect of an easy and speedy escape from what they all now doubly felt to be, not only a hostile, but Heaven doomed city. But as they proceeded, they soon perceived that a crowd was beginning to gather around them with looks and appearances indicative of any thing but friendly intent. Large numbers came pouring in from every cross street and avenue, through which they had reached the vicinity, in obedience to orders from headquarters, to impede the advance of the fugitives. But the intrepid Tulozin, by his menacing attitude, and the activity with which he swung his ponderous war-club, *     ^7  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC8035-00000076"/> 154      -  CENTEOLA; OR, succeeded for a while in causing the closely pressing crowd to give way -before him; while the stout and fear- less Wampa, with a club in one hand and a long spear in the other,-found as little difficulty in protecting the rear of the train from any dangerous intrusion. But as they began to draw near the great gate, it grew more and more doubtful whether the protection thus afforded could be sufficiently maintained to -ensure their escape from the city; For the crowd were now not only rapidly concen- trating around them; but, pressing closer and closer on every side, began to utter loud threats and exhibit other demonstrations of meditated'violence. With redoubled ex- ertions, however, Tulozin and Wampa still succeeded in keeping the angry multitude at bay while the imperiled party proceeded rapidly on their way, but not without many an anxious glance to get sight of the gate, to which they Were anxiously looking as the goal of their deliver- ance. That goal at length appeared; but to their dismay, they at once perceived it fb be securely closed: while be- fore it stood a grim array of armed warriors ready to dis- pute -their passage and drive them back to the Sacred Enclosure, and these were flanked on either side by a dense throng of the common citizens, who, keenly sym- pathizing in this movement-for their capture, were filling the air with, their shouts of exultation and defiance. What should the persecuted fugitives do now? Their means of escape Were cut off at every point: For it was   THE MATT) OF THE MOUNDS.      155 utterly in vain to think of trying to force their way through the ranks of those ferocious looking armed men, and that heavy, and strongly barred gate, in front; while in the rear, and on both sides of them, an angry and de- fiant crowd completely blocked up the way and precluded every chance of escape in either of those directions. The besieged party, however, in despite of all these for- bidding appearances, continued to push their -way forward until they reached a point about fifty yards from the gate; when they came to a halt for consultation. "Fear not, my kind friends and protectors," said Cen- teola, looking round on her trusty and revering band, "fear not-stand firm!  My God, who has so signally protected and guided us thus far, will not desert us now in this new peril, but will surely again interpose for our deliverance. Be calm! stand still, and witness His sal- vation:" But the sublime faith of the pious and gifted maiden was not, with the exception of Alcoan, perhaps fully shared by her party. They could see no avenue for es- cape, nor conceive of any way by which it could be brought about. They consequently gave themselves up in imagination as certain victitms of speedy capture to be followed, doubtless, by dungeons and death. That faith however, was not destined to prove false or delusive. The means of their deliverance were at hand,  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC8035-00000077"/> 156        CENTEOLA; OR, and about to appear in a shape as singular and remarka- ble as it was unexpected. -Two of the King's mastodons had been kept that day in the south-eastern part of the city, and when the subterra- neous explosion, which we have described, occurred, these huge animals, it would seem, at once took the alarm, broke from their Enclosure, and, to gain their native forests, in- stinctively made their way in the direction of the western gate, through which they had been accustomed to enter the city. Having become bewildered, however, among the narrow cross-streets abounding in that quarter, they had been considerably delayed in reaching the point at which they were aiming. But while thus rushing hither and thither, and bearing down everything in their way in their attempts to extricate themselves, they happened to catch sight-of some known object in the vicinity of the gate; when instantly taking a fresh start, they came with tre- mendous force thundering down a cross street which opened into the main one directly between the besieged party, and the force gathered before, and around the gate to oppose and capture them. And the instant the mad- dened'brutes reached the great street, they turned short to the left, and heedless of the throng in their way, they made, side by side, a furious push for the well remem- bered entrance, trampling scores of the completely sur- prised and screeching guards and the abetting crowd, like so many feeble worms, into the earth; and breaking   I           THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.      157 through the massive gate with a terrible crash, bearing it down, as if it had been some cobweb, before them, made their way into the open country, leaving a wide path behind them thickly strewed with the dead and wounded, the uninjured part of the crowd tumbling over each other in their wild attempts to get out of the way, or rushing off and fleeing in the utmost confusion and affright from the strange, and as yet scarcely comprehend- ed scene. "Centeola's God has prevailed!" exultingly shouted Tulozin. "He has again interposed and again opened a i    way for our escape. Let us instantly improve the favored moment; and on through the gate-way before our discom- fited pursuers can rally from their confusion." So saying, he sprang eagerly forward and loudly called on all the rest of the beleagured party to follow. And in a moment more the whole company were rapidly thread- ing their way along the death-strewed pathway, and over the ruins of the prostrate and nearly demolished gate. In another, they had safely passed beyond the walls and gained the little eminence in the vicinity, on which, as be- fore described, they had taken position before entering the city on the previous evening; and all this was effected be- fore the guards and assisting throng, or those of them left alive and uninjured from the stampede of the mastodons, had sufficiently recovered from the terrible panic, into which they had been thrown, to think of interposing any  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8035-00000078"/> 158        CENTEOLA; OR, resistance to the egress of their intended victims from the' city. Here the escaped party supposed, after. what had hap- pened, they would be no further molested, believing that the signaldisplays of Heaven, in their repeated deliver- ances which must have been noted by their foes, would deter the latter from attempting any further pursuit. But in this comforting -conclusion they soon perceived they were to be disappointed; For, in a few moments, a for- midable array of the rallied and freshy reinforced war- riors and guards, swelled by large numbers of the fierce and determined crowd, all seemingly infuriated at the strange and unexpected escape of those whom they had looked upon as already within their grasp, were seen mad- ly rushing 'through the cumbered gateway; and, as they caught sight of their intended victims unexpectedly halted so near at hand, springing forward, with fresh outhursts of wrath and exultation for their instant seizure. But their career was destined to be a short one. At that crit- ical instant, the senses of all were assailed by the noise of an explosion, bursting up from the heart of the city, so loud and deafening as to make both pursuers and pursued alike recoil aghast, stagger and reel before the terrible concussion; while, everywhere around, the solid earth began violently to shake, heave and oscillate, like the waves of an agitated ocean. There was a brief and ominous pause, and then, in quick succession, came crash   THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.       159 upon crash, whose uniting reports sent up their mingling roar to the echoing vault of the shuddering heavens; while, at thie same time, the long lines of walls, towers, temples and houses, were seen toppling and tumbling to the earth, and laying the whole city in one wide, wild mass of undistinguishable ruin. Again were the terri- ble throes of the troubled elements hushed into momen- tary silence, during which the mingled cries, shrieks and groans of the tens of thousands of the mangled and dy- ing victims, rose in one long, loud wail of agony from the extended scene of destruction and wo. Then quickly succeeded another and still more terrific shock of the volcanic earthquake, accompanied with the roar of ten thousand thunders and concussions of the earth and heav- ens so stunning, and awful, as to throw most of the fugitive party from their feet. and so over-power their bewildered senses, as to leave them only dimly conscious that the ground on which they stood, with the whole adjoining plain, was being bodily raised and thrown up into broken Osells, and ridges, fifty or a hundred feet above the former i   level. Partially rallying from their consternation, they eager- ly cast their eyes towards the spot where they last saw    their infuriated assailants rushing forward fo r their cap- ture or destruction. But those assailants were no where to be seen. The ground, even, where they stood, together with the whole line of the walls of the city, had thus i                      .

And' in that dark and terrible abyss those wrathful and blinded minions of superstition and wroneg, together with their whole city, with all its multitudinous population, had gone down to the common grave forever. It had been a scene too frightful for language to portray. But the elements had not ceased their terrible commo- tion: for next was heard, beneath the dark, impenetrable cloud that hung, like a vast pall over the death-devoted spot, the gushing, boiling sounds, mingled with the cata- ract roar of suddenly breaking up fountains, and then all seemed gradually subsiding into comparative silence. In a short time that cloud slowly lifted; and, in the brisk breeze that suddenly sprung up, rolled darkly away to the south, disclosing a broad, deep, rock-walled chasm, whose apparent bottom was overspread by the still agitated and bubbling waters of a newly formed lake, extending over the whole site of that proud and wicked city which had so awfully, and mysteriously, just disappeared from the face of the earth. '"Centeola," said the young chief reverently approach- ing the maiden, who had dismounted, and, with most of her attendants, stood gazing with fear and wonder over the dark watery grave of the doomed city; " beautiful   THE MAID -OF THE MOUNDS.      161 and blessed Centeola, that God is henceforth my God.

It was He who warned my father in a dream that he might escape the coming doom. And I bless Him that He has this day turned'my. heart to be- come one of His humble worshippers." "The words of Tulozin shed the sunshine of joy over the heart of Centeola," responded the other with a gra- cious smile. "Her favorable 'impression of his charac- ter, and her confident predictions that he would soon be- come one of the children of light, have all been confirmed. His deeds, which are only true interpreters of the heart, have shown him to be all, and more than all he now pro- fesses. He has not only done a great and acceptable service to the' cause of our God, but been the means of saving Centeola, her father and their partyl from the ma- lignant designs of a wicked priest and his-blinded follow- ers. What shall be his reward? Let him name it and it shall be his." !"The heart of Tulozin," meekly and tremulously re- sponded the noble young chief, " the heart of Tulozin un- til now has known but one wish, indulged but one hope.

"Centeola,' blushingly rejoined the maiden, "claims nothing from the discovery, to which you allude. She will feel no pride in having her name, associated with those, however high or regal they may have been, who have this day so appallingly gone to their last account. She knows no father, or guide, but the good Sage, Alcoan. Let him be consulted; and what he may say and sanction, she will not gainsay, or oppose." The old Sage, who had stood wistfully by, and, with looks of satisfaction, noted all that had passed between the lovers, now took the willing hand-of Centeola, and placing it in that of -the gratified Tulozin, tenderly and solemnly said to them - "It is clearly the will of our God that this should be so.

"Live, O Queen!" Live, O King! Live long and happily! Live forever!" "It is well," rejoined the gratified Sage. "It is but a just tribute and fitting salutation. May many a rolling sun henceforth look down upon a happy, prosperous and regenerated nation,- well and wisely governed by Queen Centeola and King Tulozin. But let us remain here no longer looking down upon the dreadful gulf wherein the ^ icked perished. The savage hords of the North will soon be here. Let us hence to our own loved village of the Feathered Serpents, where the marriage festival shall be appropriately celebrated; and where, as soon as the delegates from the other tribes can be assembled, the noble pair we have just seen united, shall be formally crowned and proclaimed the Queen and King of Azatlan.

We shall not, therefore, except in *   the briefest summary of the leading events that mark- ed their subsequent careers; attempt to describe how the different personages of our story, and the noted people with whom they were connected, fulfilled the remark- able destinies which Providence seems to have allotted them in the near, and distant, future. How, in accord ance with the suggestions of the venerable Alcoan, the marriage festival of Centeola and Tulozin was brilliantly celebrated, together with that of Wampa and Mitla, who were thereupon appointed heads of the household estab- lishment of their royal master and mistress. How, when the deputies of the confederate tribes came together, the noble, and heaven-favored pair were, amidst the joyful acclamations of a disenthralled people, duly crowned at the romantic and beautiful village of the Feather ed Ser- pents, which they henceforward made their royal home, and the new Imperial city of the nation. How they, and 'all the tribes, made the best possible defensive prepara- tions for the long and relentless war, which, in a short period, was waged against them all by the dreaded bar- barian horde from the North, that, in countless numbers began to swarm over the whole length and breadth of the devoted land. tHow the- brave Tulozin led the serried lines of his gallant warriors forth to battle with the pow- /      f    THE MAID OF THE MOUNDS.      165 erful but undisciplined foe, and achieved many a brilliant victory. How the heroic and heaven-inspired Centeola; also joined her noble husband in the red fields of battle, wherje mounted on her splendidly  caparisoned white charger, with her snowy. plumes streaming in the breeze, she was seen dashing upon the foe at the head of her chosen columns, filling the superstitious foe with dismay, and causing them, everywhere; to give way before her impetuous onsets. How, for the first five years of the new reign, those outnumbering (robber) foes were kept at bay by the many fierce and destructive sorties, that were repeatedly made by the everywhere closely beleaguered people, from the well-defended fortress mounds with which they had studded the land; nor how, - when the substance of the country at large was consumed by the all-devouring barbarians, while the limits of safe cultiva- tion and the hunting ranges were constantly contracting, so that the strongest positions gave no promise of being tenable much- longer,-- the confederate Tribes, one after another began their exodus to regions where they could cultivate the land and range the forests for game, in peace, and enjoy the fruits of their toils without fear or moles- tation.

"I want you should tell me that story again, grand- fathier,- that story about grandmother and the children starving in the woods, and the curious dream you had about it, you know," said a small, bright boy, coaxingly laying his hands on the knee of an aged man, who sat listlessly smoking his pipe in his easy chair, placed in the doorway of one of the rural cottages of Vermont, so that he could look out on the green hills he loved so well, while enjoying the grateful coolness of a midsummer evening. "Yes, my boy," responded the old man, rotsing him- self from his reverie, and-laying aside his pipe. "Yes, that strange and wonderful dream!'- I love to recall it, because I shall always believe it came from Heaven to give me the forewarning that was 'to be the means of saving my family from perishing of hunger. "But in the first place, my boy, perhaps you would like to know how your grandfather and his family came to settle here in the woods, at that time so far away from the homes of any other settlers. I will tell you: "Fifty years ago I lost nearly all I was worth, by the 8  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC8035-00000084"/> 170      THE STARVING SETTLERS. great depreciation in the old Continental paper money which followed the close of the Revolutionary war. "But I resolved not to lie down and die under the misfortune. I posted off to the city and got my continen- tal rags changed to silver, before they grew any worse; and seeking out a land proprietor of the new State of Vermont, I soon struck a bargain with him for three hun- dred acres for two hundred dollars, paid him on the spot, and came home with the deeds, maps of the country, &amp;c., in my pocket, together with a surplus of one hundred dollars to get me to, and start me upon, my new purchase. Within one week we were all, with the team and driver hired for the purpose, on our way to-the last settlement, in the direction of the place where I -was to establish my forest home; within another, having got my family into comfortable quarters, I was,- with pack, gun, and axe, making my way through the pathless forest towards, the locality of my land, which, though over thirty miles distant, I succeeded in -reaching that day before sun-set. I found my land, as J was told I should, lying on the east bank of Onion river, and embracing a -noble expanse of forest meadow-land, bounded north and south by two con- siderablestreams, that here came in on the same side of the river, and less than a mile apart. Here, lodging in my bark-covered shanty, alone in the wilderness, with no white inhabitants within thijrty miles of me on one side, I worked through the whole of that long summer and au-   THE STARVING SET'TLERS.     171  tumn, cut down, burned and cleared up ten acres of for- est, built a comfortable log-house, laid up, in part, by the timely assistance of some transient land-lookers, and then, as winter approached, returned to my family in the set- tlements. "Being now with my family again, I cheerfully work- ed through the winter for what I could get, bought a stout horse, and made other preparations for an early removal in the spring to our new home in the woods. And accord- ingly, when May came, with my wife and our two young- est on the horse, in addition to the bag of meal, bedding and clothing, with which the strong beast was loaded down, and myself, with pot and kettles, filled with seed corn, salt, plates, knives and forks, slung on my back, and gun and axe in my hands, and with all my older children placed in a row behind me, we, early one morning, commenced our toilsome journey through the wilderness. Not being able to get through, with all our encumbrances, in one day, we halted at dark, threw up a bough shanty, and under it, with a fire at our feet, all slept soundly, except myself who kept awake to be on my guard against the wolves and catamounts, which were often heard howling in the woods round our camp, and once came so near it, that I could see their eyed gleaming in the light of our camp fire. It was a hard journey for us throughout; but we got safely to our new home the next day; and notwithstanding our fatigues we all felt very happy and grateful. Our long dreaded jour-  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC8035-00000085"/> 172      THE STARVING SETTLERS. ney was over, and we thought our hardships at an end, hap- pily blind to the terrible trials we were destined yet to en- counter. "In the course of a month, I found our breadstuffs were getting too low to admit of much longer delay in procuring a new supply, and with the view of being sure of having such a supply in-season, I resolved to make a journey, at once, for the purpose, to the settlement on Lake Champlain,- which was rather a shorter and easier route than the one to thte other settlement where I had lived. There were at this time a few families living on the eastern shore of the lake, at the place which has since grown up into the populous village of Burlington. Among these, the leading man, and life and soul of the settlement, was one Gideon King, who afterwards became the rich man of the lake country. When I reached my destination, I ascertained that there were no breadstuffs to be had in the place. But King said he had that day dispatched a sloop to the south end of the lake for a load of meal, flour and other provisions, which were to be brought overland from Albany, and that if I would wait for her return, which would doubtless be with- in five days, I should be supplied, and in the meantime he would give me employment. Falling in with this propo- sition, I went to work, and, for several days, felt no uneasi- ness. But when five days had passed, and no sloop made her appearance, I expressed my surprise and concern to her owner. He, however, seemed to feel no apprehensions   THE STARVING SETTLERS.      173 for her fate, and, attributing her delay to some failure in the arrival of some part of her cargo from Albany, recom- mended me to keep on at work and wait patiently for the sloop, which now, within a day or two, would certainly- make her appearance. This, I at last consented to do, though very reluctantly; for I somehow began to feel a singular misgiving about matters at home ; and feeling tired as well as dejected, I that night went to bed before dark, and immediately fell asleep ; when I seemed to be at once trans- ported, either in dreams or vision, to my distant home, and placed on a broad maple stump standing about a dozen yards in front of the door of my cabin. Without being permitted to speak, or make myself known, I was allowed to see all that was going on among the family, who were quietly moving in and about the house, and preparing for supper; for it seemed to be just about the time of the eve- ning I had fallen asleep thirty miles off I perceived-that the fresh fish and game I procured for them had all disappear- ed, and that they now had nothing in the house to eat but bread. And I soon saw my wife and daughter, Minnie, then a resolute girl of sixteen, in earnest consultation about something, which I understood related to the necessi- ty of having some trout caught that night for the next morn- ing's breakfast a feat which I knew Minnie had sometimes performed. It was with no surprise, therefore, that I soon saw her come out of the house, take down my fish-pole, with hook and line, attached, and taking my next, a boy of n  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC8035-00000086"/> 1 X7     THE STARVING SETTLERS. nine, along with her, dig some grubs for bait, put them on, the hook, proceed to the river, and throw in. Short- ly after this I saw her look up with a significant smile; and the next moment I saw her bending and straightening with all her might in a pull upon the pole, while a pro- digious large trout was brought flashing and floundering to the surface of the water, when suddenly -the pole flew back with a jerk, stripped of both hook and line. It would be difficult to describe the look-of disappointment and con- cern which stamped the unlucky girls' countenance, as she sadly took her way back to the house; and most keenly did I sympathize with her troubled feelings, for I knew as well as she did, that the loss of their only hook and line was a great calamity to them all. Nor was this all that seem- ed to disturb me and increase my anxieties for the fami- ly. I somehow felt that there was still some greater mis- fortune in store for them, and near at hand. So I kept my post to watch for whatever might befall. "It was a bright, starlight night, and, after having seen my family make their supper, on their Indian Johnny- cake and water, bar the door, retire to their beds, and all become hushed in slumber, I seemed to employ my time in alternately casting watchful glances around the house that held all my dearest treasures, and then, in gazing around my opening, and on the wall-like masses of forest which looming up dimly against the sky-light, seemed to enclose it in far-stretching, mountain ramparts. Standing '  .   JLo.,i IL V LA "X .LLULJ,.:tL ---.  here like a sentinel on his watch-tower, I appeared not to be conscious of the lapse of time. A vision which must have extended through seven or eight hours, did not seem to occupy one; and before I thought of morning, the chirp- ing of the wood-birds, and the peculiar chill and ruffling of the air which are always the precursors of approaching day, apprised me that the dawn was close at hand. While making these observations, I heard the cracking of brush, as if under the tread of some heavy animal, emerging from the woods into my opening. And, the next moment, I could discern a large, black, moving-object, attended by two small ones, making a wide circle around my house, but drawing nearer and nearer, and snuffing eagerly, as if for some scented food. as they approached. I perceived them to be a bear and cubs, and knew they were intent on seiz- ing something; but still I felt no apprehensions for the family, for I knew that the bears would not be able to effect an entrance into the house. "But as I saw the old bear cautiously leading her cubs under a small, open, bark-covered shed, which I had pre- viously thrown up against one end of the house, for storing dry wood, and to serve as a convenient place for my wife to keep her kettles and such things as she had not room for in the house, an alarming truth, for the first time, flashed across my mind. Among the rough articles of fur- niture I had dug or hewn out from logs, was a small but heavy chest, which I had placed under my bark shed, and  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC8035-00000087"/> 176      THE STARVING SETTLERS. beneath the window opening into it, and which, for want of a lid, I had kept covered with a wide roll of peeled spruce bark. And I now recollected that the morning I left, wishing -to take my bag with me, I had, for want of a receptacle in-doors, emptied all our remaining stock of meal into this chest, which, with its wide, overlapping cover, I supposed would be as secure as if placed inside the house. And scarcely had the recollection come to mind, before I saw the old bear approach the chest, tear off the the bark cover with her paws, and plunge her head with- in. The hungry cubs quickly followed her example, and all three, the next moment, were obviouly engaged in de- vouring our little treasure of meal, while, with feelings amounting to perfect agony, I was compelled to witness the destruction without the power of stirring from my post, or of raising the least outcry to drive the thieving brutes away. They made short work of it, and turned to retreat from the place, when in so doing, the old bear trod on the bark cover, which broke under her great weight with a loud crash. The noise evidently, for the first time, awoke my wife, for I at once heard a stir within, and the next moment, I saw her hastily thrust her head from the window, glance wildly after the retreating bears, and then look down, in utter consternation, into the empty chest beneath. She seemed to' comprehend everything in an instant, and turned away with a cry of anguish and des- pair that pierced me to the heart like a sword. I made   THE STARVING SETTLERS.      1" a desperate effort to leap from my stand to rush to her side; and thought I was succeeding, but instead of strik- ing the ground, I landed1 on the floor of my bed-room in King's house, on the lake shore, and found myself awake, just as the first flushes of the morning were breaking through my window. For some time I could not give up the idea of the reality of what I seemed to have witnessed, so vividly had every scene been impressed on my mind. But, after rubbing my eyes, striking my head and collect- ing my confused senses, I was forced to pronounce it all a dream. But it seemed to me to be a providential warn- ing of some terrible calamity impending over my family; and so I hurriedly dressed, went down, related my dream to my employer, and told him I believed I ought to start immediately for home. But King had no faith in dreams, and especially none in the one I had related, which he said was too absurd to spend a thought upon. And be- sides, he said it would be no use for me to return now, for I could carry no meal; that he was almost out, himself, and no other family in the place would dare to part with a pound. No, I had better keep at work, as the sloop would be along that day or the next, and I could then have for my family all the supplies I could carry. "Over-persuaded, but not satisfied, I again proceeded, after breakfast, to my work, and kept on, thinking every morning that the sloop would surely arrive at night, and every night, that she would be in by morning, and being 8*  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC8035-00000088"/> 178      THE STARVING S'TTLERS. more reluctant than ever to leave without anything for my family, I staid several days longer; when, onr the tenth night of my absence from home, I had another dream, a complete counterpart of the former one. I was again transported in spirit, at the same hour, to my old stand before my house, when my mind seemed first to be drawn back to the time I was there in vision before, and then to take up events where I had left them, and follow them day by day as regularly as in a journal, to this my second visit. I saw my wife, the day following the loss of the meal, go out into the yard, in response to the cries of the children for food, pick up the feet of a deer I had killed a fort-night before, and make of them a broth, which was all they had to nourish them that day. The next day, after gathering a mess of wild onions or leeks, which, as miserable as they were for food, were the only things they were certain of obtaining, my daughter and oldest boy ranged the woods till nearly night, with poles or clubs, in the hope of being able to knock down a par- tridge or squirrel, but without success. And they re- newed the vain search on the third day, and kept it up till my boy gave out, when my daughter brought him to the house and gave over the profitless attempt. They had then lived three days on no other food than on the wretched deer-feet broth and then on the green, trashy leeks that thickly grew on the banks of the river, and all the younger children had grown so feeble that they could   T THE STARVING SETTLERS.     179 only crawl about the house. Even my wife, grown so thin and haggard that I should hardly have-known her, could not walk steadily across the floor, and they all were evidently fast running down to helplessness and death - al but my brave daughter, who bore up won- derfully against the threatened calamity. On the eve- ning of the day last mentioned, she gathered a large quantity of- leeks, and early the -next morning she was astir, preparing to carry out a resolution she appeared to have secretly formed for the relief of the family, which was to try to reach the southern settlement and return with food in time to save them from perishing. Accord- ingly, despite the remonstrances of her mother, who, when informed of the bold resolve, said it could only-re- sult in her death on the way, she left the house, and dis- appeared in the direction of her proposed destination. "I seemed readily to understand why Minnie had gone to the southern settlement, instead of following me, who might be expected to bring food as soon as any was to be had. During our residence there, the winter before, she had received attentions from a young man named Constant Martin, which he was very anxious should result in mar- riage; and she knew, if she could reach there that day, he would not only procure provisions, but attend her back with them the next day, and in time, she believed, yet to save them all from death. The day of her depart- ure was a sad one- for the -rest-of them, but it at length  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC8035-00000089"/> 180   -   THE STARVING SETTLERS. wore away, the evening bringing up the time to this, my second vision. I was left to take direct note of the pres- ent condition of my suffering family. But O, what an agonizing sight for a father and husband to witness, was there! The pinched, skeleton faces of my prostrate chil- dren; the feeble wails and piteous cries for food that every few minutes burst from their lips; amidst their disturbed slumbers, and the sobs and prayers of their almost as feeble mother, vainly trying to encourage and comfort them, were the only sights and sounds that greeted my pained senses during the night, through the whole of which I seemed' compelled to keep up my distressing vigil. At daybreak, however, I appeared to be suddenly released, and awakening, found myself, as at the close of my previ- ous vision, in my bed-room at Burlington. "This -second dream, so curiously connected with the - first, instantly removed every lingering doubt from my mind. I now knew them  both to be true, and deter- mined not to delay another hour in starting for home. So, after glancing out of my window down to the landing on the lake, and ascertaining that the sloop had not ar- rived, I hastened to my employer, related my fresh dream, and announced my resolve for an immediate departure. This time making no effort to delay me, he brought out the- remains of a cold, boiled fish, with a small piece of, bread, bade me eat and begone, adding, that I could at least go and kill wild' meats enough to keep my family   THE STARVING S  'ETTLERS.    181 from starving till breadstuffs could be procured. Within fifteen minutes, I was on my :way home, which, by strong exertions, I thought I should be able to reach by the mid- dle of the afternoon. But in endeavoring to save the dis- tance of several miles by striking directly across the for- est, instead of following up the river round the northern bend of the last fifteen miles of its course, I got bewil- dered and lost in the woods; and after wandering about all the forenoon, I reached the river only a mile or two nearer home than my first starting point. To make up my lost time, I now made the most strenuous efforts to get forward, pausing only to throw myself dozwn at the cool rills I crossed on my rough and tangled way, to quench the burning thirst that was continually parching my lips and throat to fever heat and dryness. But with all my exertions, I perceived the daylight declining, and a dark, cloudy night settling down upon the wilder- ness, while miles of my journey yet remained to be accom- plished. How I then, in fading twilight, forced my way over and through the obstructing objects of the forest,-it is now impossible for me to tell, and I only know that, after a long and terrible struggle, I at length emerged . into my opening, and threw- myself panting and exhaust- ed upon the ground.  While lying there to recover my breath and strength before going forward to present myself to my family, I felt while turning on my' hip, something in my pocket, which I did not know was there,;  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC8035-00000090"/> 182      THE -,STARVING SETTLERS. but I now recollected that while I was at rmy breakfast that morning, Mr. King came up behind me and slipped something there, which till then I had forgotten to ex- amine. I nowl eagerly thrust my hand into the pocket, and drew forth a small flask, which I found to contain a  good half pint of, Jamaica spirits. I blessed God for the discovery, for, while taking a much needed swallow myself, I thought how beneficially this spirit might be used in the restoration of my family, if I found them in the situation I so much apprehended. But what if, by this time, they were all -dead? In the pang of an- guish that shot through me-as the dismal fancy crossed my mind, I sprang to my feet, and rushed forward to the top of a little swell, which commanded a full and near view of my house; my heart sank within me as I sent a searching glance over the dimly discerned outlines of the building and perceived all to be as dark and silent as the grave!  "Dead! Yes, all dead! I groaned in an agony of spirit that almost smote me to the earth. But stay! what was that? -0 joy! it was a twinkling light, issu- ing from the crevices between the logs composing the walls of my house. Now Heaven be praised! I shouted. they are yet alive! And, the next moment, a bright flash, as if caused by the stirring up of a decayed fire, and the plainly audible sounds of the naturally accompanying - Movements' within the house, fell together on my over- e      THE STARVING  B's'TT'LES.    183 joyed senses. Yes, alive, and all alive and well, I'll warrant it, after all this fright and fuss, I exclaimed in the sudden and intoxicating revulsion of feeling. Now what a prodigious fool I have been to be so worked up by those miserable empty dreams! They shall never know it, however; and I will put on such a face, as I meet them, that they cannot even mistrust I have been guilty of such folly. So, with an assumed lightness of manner and mo- tion, I passed on rapidly to the house, and entered the door, briskly exclaiming, ' hurrah! to you all--here I am, at last, but as hungry as a bear. So, now, wife, for a good supper!' But as my eyes fell on the face of my wife, and then glanced over those of the children, as they lay feebly moaning and. sobbing on their pallets, I stopped as short as if I had met a staggering blow. My wife' raised her pale, emaciated, wo-begone face,and gave me a look of anguish and rebuke, that, to my dying day, I shall never forget. She made an attempt to speak, but her lips trembled, her frame became convulsed, and she burst into a paroxysm of weeping, so violent as to prevent her from uttering a word. "'Never mind, O, never mind, dear wife, I sooth- ingly said, as soon as I could speak, 'you need not try to tell me-I -know  all. But cheer up, now; -for though I bring no neat, you and the children shall-yet be saved."'-  "With that I ran to my cupboard, took down a large  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC8035-00000091"/> 184      THE STARVING SETTLERS. spoon, and filling it from my flask of spirits, approach- ed and poured it into her mouth, and then administered, one after another, a like dose to each of my children. I then kindled, up a smart fire, hung over it a pot of water, into which I flung a little salt, seized my gun, ex- amined the priming, and saying, in answer to the inquir- ing look Of my wife, that I would be back with some kind of game within an hour, rushed out of the house for the woods. I remembered that there was a cove of still water in the river, about half a mile from the house, in a deep and dark part of the forest, where the moose often resorted, to keep the musketoes and flies from their legs, by standing in the water during the fore part of the night. To that spot I now directed my steps. After reaching the place, as I did with much ,difficulty, owing to the thick underbrush, and the darkness which was there so great that I could not see a hand before my face, I cautiously crept forward to the edge of the water and took my stand opposite to the path in which the moose used to come down into the cove. Here I stood some twenty minutes, when suddenly the well- known, heavy and peculiar tramp - tramp - tramp of the long-stepping moose distinctly i fell, and fast grew louder, on my ear. And, presently, wfth a crash and a splash, the animal came down the bank in the old path, and plunging into the water, came to a dead halt within fifty yards of the spot where I was standing. My heart leaped into my mouth at the sounds;   THE STARVING SETTLERS.      185 my gun was quickly brought to my shoulder, and my finger involuntarily began to draw on the trigger. But what was the use in firing, when the animal was as in- visible to me as if he were a mile distant? None, unless, some higher power interposed to assist me. Yet fire I must; and therefore, in an agony of earnestness, I breathed the prayer: "' Father of all - helper of the suffering -feeder of the hungry, thou seest the situation of my starving family/, and the certain death that awaits them, with- out speedy relief. Then, O, wilt thou not in thy mer- cy, direct the bullet, and provide the food which shall save them from perishing. Amen!' "With the last word I pulled the trigger, and the deafening report of my heavily loaded gun pealed out on the hushed wilderness; while the sudden and terrible plunging and splashing, as of a strong animal in its death struggles, told me how well my bullet had executed its heaven-guided mission. After waiting a minute for the animal's struggles to subside, I ran round to the part of the cove where he lay, dashed in, seized one of his hind feet and drew him ashore, just as he was bubbling out from his, submerged nostrils, his last breath of life. Instantly whipping out my hunting knife, and guiding mainly by the sense of feeling, I ripped down and tore away the skin from one of the haunches, cut out a good junk of solid flesh, and with it made my way with all possible speed to the house.  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC8035-00000092"/> 186-      THE STARVING SETTLERS. "Whez I reached there, I found the family, who had been sufficiently revived, by the spirits I had given them, to take note of passing events,; in a state of tremulous ex- citement and expectation, occasioned by hearing the report of my gun, which, from their faith in my skill in hunting, they took as the certain herald of success. And as the eyes of the children fell on the moose-meat I brought swinging in my hand, all came hastily tottering and crawling to my feet, and clutched the meat with tooth and nail, as though they would have gulped it down raw. But knowing the danger of permitting them to eat solid food till the tone of their enfeebled stomachs had been somewhat restored by gradual feeding on nutritious li- quids, I snatched the meat away, shaved off a good quan- tity of thin slices and, dropped them into the now seeth- ing pot I had placed over the fire in anticipation of some such event as had now so providentially occurred. I then did my best to keep the clamorous brood quiet for the next half hour; when I began to dip out the broth in small quantities, and administered it with a spoon to each of the family in turn. This I diligently pursued for the next hour, each new mess of broth, as I drew it from the pot, being perceptibly thicker and more nutritious, By this time, so fast had they all revived, they began to appear like themselves, move round the house, go out into the yard and engage in conversation. My wife, after saying she had been wondering why I   THE STARVING SETTLERS.      187 had not inquired for Minnie, began to relate how and when she had left, and expressed fears for her- safety. But I here also cut her short, telling her I knew all about that too, all which in good time I would explain, but bid her borrow no trouble; for I had full faith that the girl was safe. While I was yet speaking, my oldest boy, who had been some time out in the yard, came hastening in and said he had heard some one in the woods to the south. I rushed into the yard and raised a long halloo, which was quickly answered by a voice which I knew to be my daughter's, and which by its tones indicated joy and exultation, instead of trouble. Presently I raised another call, that as promptly as before brought my daughter's response, this time accompanied by a male voice, which I recognized to be that of her lover, Constant Martin. ' They are coming! ' Ishouted, now relieved of my last anxiety, and dancing about for joy. "' In five minutes more, with eager inquiries and joyful exclamations, they came running to the house, ladened with meal, flour, and other provisions. Our trials and sufferings were now over. We felt that we had passed from the very gates of death to the joys and comforts of life; and the bounteous meal to which we all within the next hour sat down, was more truly a Thanksgiving sup- per than any one, I will venture to say, which was ever partaken in the Green Mounitains." "But, grandfather," here spoke the listening boy, as   &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC8035-00000093"/> 188      THE STARVING SETITLERS. the other brought his narrative to a close, " my mother's name is Minnie, and my father's is Constant Martin?" '-Yes, my boy; they were married the very next win- ter after the remarkable event I have been describing, and all the sooner for it, as she had not before fully made up her mind. Yes, they are your parents; and they both, as well as the rest of us, have reason forever to remember the DREAM AND FULFILLMENT." *^   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. A TALE OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL JWID^ENCE. "There never yet was a murder committed, which was not found gut." "I beg leave to disagree with you there entirely. In- deed I have the best of reasons for believing just to the contrary." The above positive remark, and scarcely less positive reply, were made, one day, some'twenty years ago, at a p dinner table in New Orleans, and led, as trite and unim- portant as they may appear, to the judicial investigation and development, in a locality nearly two thousand miles distant, of one of the most singular and mysterious cases to be found in the whole history of criminal jurispru- dence. The first of the two speakers whom we have introduced, we will designate as Captain Willis, and the other as -Mr. Bradley, for though ours is intended to be strictly a nar- rative of facts, the names of all the principal actors, will be, for reasons which will soon be obvious to the reader, mostly fictitious. Mr. Bradley, was a Vermonter, but for many years had been in trade in New Orleans, where o ,   &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC8035-00000094"/> 190     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. he and his family permanently resided, except during the sickly months, which he spent with his connections in Vermont; or in some of the Western States. Captain Willis was a resident of Cincinnati, his sojourn in New Orleans being a-temporary one and for a secret, specific object. There had then recently been several foul and startling murders committed in St. Louis; and a number of the most shrewd and vigilant- detectives of that, and the neighboring cities, had been recently engaged to fer- ret out,: if possible, the perpetrator or perpetrators of those appalling enormities. One of these secret detec- tives was Captain Willis, and as neither he nor any of those engaged in the same object, could obtain the least clue, leading to the discovery of the criminals, anywhere near the locality of the crime,.he had taken station in New  Orleans. Here, for many days, he continued to visit all kinds of public resorts;' mingled familiarly with, all sorts of company, listening intently to all the remarks made in each,. and generally giving such turns to the con- versation, or making such assertions as were calculated to elicit some unguarded remark or reply, from which he might obtain indirect hints, or remote clues, to aid him, in making the desired discovery,  But all the ingenuity he had been able to summon for his purpose, had been exer- cised in vain, and he had heard nothing from any quar- tr, that particularly attracted his attention, until he met Mr, Br adley at the dinner party of a   mutual friend, , l   THE UNFATHOMABLE. MYSTERY.      191 by whom  they both, though perfect strangers to each other, happened to be invited. But the reply of Mr. Bradley to his assertion, which we quoted at the outset, and which he had made with his old object in view, did, at once, attract his attention; and the subsequent reserve and studied evasions, that were made to meet all his fur- ther attempts to press the subject, confirmed his belief that the other was in possession of some secret, which might concern him to know; and, though baffled for the present, he resolved to set his wits to work to obtain it. In pursuance of this purpose, he, in a few days, ex- changed his lodgings for others at a public house where he had ascertained Mr. Bradley and his family were, at that time, boarding.      - Here, although he soon found that nothing further was to be made out of the cautious Mr. Bradley, yet by cul- tivating a- familiar acquaintance with Mrs. Bradley, and with a servant, girl, -who, as he ascertained, had till lately lived in Mr. Bradley's family, he, in a few weeks, suc- ceeded in fishing out from Mrs. Bradley- and- this girl, without making them aware of his object, all the princi- pal features of the secret, of which, as he- had rightly judged, Mr. Bradley was the master. r The, secret, however, as Captain Willis found to his great disappointment had no reference to the crime, whose perpetrators he came there in the hope0of detecting. A murder he was fully satisfied had been committed; but it *       t  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC8035-00000095"/> 192     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. , f was not committed in St. Louis, or in any of the western states, but in the distant state of Vermont, and in the town of Mr. Bradley's old home, and yet he did not regret the pains he, had taken, and the unwearied patience he had ex- ercised in reaching the discovery he had so singularly made. His labors would still go to subserve the cause of justice, and he at once determined they should not be lost to the community in which the newly discovered crime had been committed. But the measures he took to ensure this result, as well as the character of the secret, on which those measures were grounded will be better dis- closed by now transferring the scene to the state where the supposed murder had occurred; and where that ,crime and all the discoverable circumstances attending it, were to be for the first time brought out before the startled public. A few weeks subsequent to the events which are above narrated: and which transpired in the city of New Orleans in the month of June 1841, the governor of Vermont re- ceived a letter from a stranger, signing his name Wlllis, dated at that city and propounding sundry extraordinary questions about the landscape peculiarities of a certain lo- cality in the town of B--, in Vermont, in reference to a large pond, a turnpike running near it, a dark piece of woods lying between the two, and a certain two story farm- house situated at the intersection of the road- and the south-eastern shore of the pond, all of which will be here- after more particularly described. The letter then pro   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      193 ceeded to ask whether within the last two or three years, any person had been missing from that town or vicinity, and ' intimating that if-these questions were answered in the affirmative, a farther communication would be made - the whole concluding with a reference to a well'known gen- tleman in Cincinnati to vouch for the credibility of the writer. The Governor was of course much surprised at receiving such an unexpected and singular communication, and scarcely knew what to make of it, but finally concluded to set an inquiry afoot through his Secretary, who resided near the locality in question, and who soon reported to the Governor, that all the different inquiries propounded in the letter might safely be answ ered in the affirmative, excepting that relating to a missing person, concerning which nothing had been ascertained. The Governor then communicated these affirmative answers to his correspond- ent, and, at the same time wrote to the gentleman in Cincinnati to whom that correspondent had referred him. In a few weeks replies came to both letters - the one from the gentleman referred to in Cincinnati, fully vouching for the credibility of the correspondent Willis, and the other from Willis himself, disclosing the substance of what he had gathered from Mr. Bradley's family respecting a mur- . der committed several years before in Vermont, naming the person who had made the disclosure to Mr. Bradley as being' an accomplice after 'the fact, and who was 9  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC8035-00000096"/> 194     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. believed to be a connection of Mr. Bradley, and was then residing in Cincinnati, where he might be arrested, taken back to Vermont, and prosecuted as an accessory, or be used as state's evidence, as should be thought best. Accordingly, the Governor dispatched his Secretary to Cincinnati to carry out the suggestions of Captain Willis, or otherwise act as circumstances might seem to dictate. When the Secretary reached that city, he found that Captain Willis had returned from New Orleans, and that Mr. Bradley had also come north, and, with his family, had taken up his summer residence with some friends-in Indiana. The Secretary then caused the young man, pointed out-by Willis as an accessory to the supposed murder, to be arrested and brought before the Mayor of the city; when it soon appeared that Willis had made a mistake in supposing him to be a connection of Mr. Brad- ley; further, that he could not be the person who made the alledged disclosure, and that, in fact, he knew nothing about the-case.: The Secretary then pushed on into Indi- ana to see what could be elicited from Mr. Bradley, who, being taken by surprise, and perceiving that the main features of his secret had, by some means, become known, soon frankly admitted he knew all about the subject of inquiry, and then proceeded to give a--full and circum- stantial detail of all that had come to his knowledge con- cerning the case, which he confidently believed, he said, to have been one of deliberate murder. He further   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      195 stated that the person who made this startling disclosure to him was a; young man of the name of Craney, who, at that time lived in his sister's family in Vermont, but was now a clerk in a store in- the north part of that State, and finally, that, after his return to New Orleans from 'his visit to Vermont, on which occasion the disclosure was made, Craney had repeatedly written him, and in all his letters reiterated his statements, and from time to time added new circumstances going to show the entire truth of his revelations. But 'leaving the Secretary to return home with -the secret thus obtained, and prepare for the contemplated legal investigation of the affair, we will now -proceed, after such preliminary statements as, may be necessary for a clear understanding of what follows, to lay before the reader in detail the extraordinary disclosure which that secret involved: There is, as before intimated, in the town of B--, situated in the central part of Vermont, a large pond, or rather two ponds of different sizes, connected by a short, narrow strait, the smaller, or most -northerly, being about half a mile long, by a quarter wide, and the larger, or most southerly, being nearly a mile long, by half a mile wide, and projecting eastward beyond the smaller pond about as much as the difference between the width of the two bodies of water. On the eastern side of these ponds, and parallel with the smaller, runs an old turnpike  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC8035-00000097"/> 196-     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. road, leading from the populous place a few miles distant, which- we will designate, as the people of that section generally designate it, by the appellation of The Village. This road, passing by the smaller pond at a distance from it of about a quarter of a mile, strikes upon the shore of the' larger one near its southern extremity, leaving be- tween the smaller pond and the road an extended reach of dark, thick and almost impenetrable cedar swamp. Nea/r where the road strikes thee larger pond stood, at the time the events we are narrating occurred, a two story farm- house, occupied by a Mr. Nymore, in whose respectable family had long lived the young man Craney before men- tioned, then of the age of about twenty-two; who, though not of the most respectable extraction, had yet always sustained a fair character for truth and honesty, and pos- 'sessed the fullest confidence and respect of the family with whom he resided. Some time subsequent to the month of October 1839, however, Mrs. Nymore began to notice some peculiarities in the young man's demeanor, such as a general restlessness, absence of mind, dejection, and ill health, without any known causes. She also no- ticed, in common with her neighbors, that without any ap- parent means, he appeared to be always well supplied with motley. All this, for a while, she attributed to gambling, into' which vice she feared he had somewhere been initia- ted. But a short time after she had settled on this con- clusion, a young mechanic, who had been boarding in the   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      197 family, and had become somewhat intimate with Craney, told her, as he was about to leave for a distant residence, that she need not harbor any unfavorable opinion of Craney; or suspect, even should she discover that he had large sums of money; by him, that he came by it from gambling or any dishonest practices; for he had inno- cently become possessed of a writing by which he could command as much money as he wanted.   This strange, enigmatical communication caused the good lady much uneasiness, and led her to suspect that Craney had know- ledge of some crime in others, who were bribing him to secrecy, and she therefore took an opportunity to ques- tion him alone, asking him if he had somebody's promis- sory note or other monied obligation, on which he was re- ceiving or expecting considerable sums of money? He denied having any note; but finally admitted that he, had a paper with the signature of two men affixed. to it, which would command him  money enough, if he chose to exact it; but, " the affair " he saidl, "so much worried his mind, that he was tempted to give up or des- troy the writing, and have no more to do with the disa- greeable business." He then, though refusing to make any further explanations, asked her to advise him whether he should give up, or retain the paper. Being now con- firmed in her suspicions, that he was concealing some great crime for others, who might some day seek his ruin or perhaps his life, for the purpose of concealing their own  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC8035-00000098"/> 198     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERYo guilt, she advised him by all means to retain the paper for his own safety. After this, although deeply perplexed and distressed, she made no further attempt todraw the secret from the young man, who continued to reside in the family as before; and, as before was always flush of money, to which, however, he seemed to attach but little value, and so the matter rested for many months, and until her brother, the Mr. Bradley before frequently mentioned, came from New Orleans to spend a part of the summer months in the family of his sister, the lady just introduced; and the latter, who, not knowing where the consequences would fall, had not dared to tell any one her suspicions in relation to Craney, concluded to make Mr. Bradley her confidant, and she accordingly communicated to him all she had gathered and guessed about the matter as above related, and requested him to have a private talk with the young man; get at the bottom of the mys- tery, if possible, and give him such advice as the circum- stances might seem  to require. With the  view of complying with that request, and obtaining a good oppor- tunity for so doing, Mr. Bradley offered to carry Craney to a neighboring town, where the latter had recently en- gaged as a  clerk in a store; and the proposal being gladly accepted the two set off in a wagon together, and during the ride, and while Mr. Bradley was thinking how he should introduce the matter, on which he had promised his sister he would take action, Craney voluntarily intro-   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.     199 duced the- subject himself; and after, premising that he was in possession of a fearful secret, which had entirely destroyed his peace of mind, and that he had been long looking for a trusty confidant to whom he might safely unbosom himself, and from whom he would be likely to receive good advice, he proceeded to make the following startling disclosure, accompanied throughout with every appearance of sincerity, and even with obvious agitation and distress. "One evening in October a year ago the coming fall," he said, "I went down the turnpike on horse-back to the tavern at the corner, which we call about a mile and a half distant, to attend a meeting of young men to choose managers and make other arrangements for a ball, that we had in contemplation. It was very late-about mid- night probably - when we broke up, and I started alone for home, while thinking over the arrangements for the ball,- for which I had been chosen one of the managers. I reached the bdrder of the great Cedar Swamp; when I %x  soon caught a glimpse of two men, bearing some heavy burden between them, and hurrying along down an old over-grown wood-road, which strikes in obliquely on the right, not far from the corner of the woods, and runs off south-westerly nearly to the head of the little pond. Supposing them to be some -of the young fellows of the neighborhood, taking this sly way to go down to the pond with a seine or a log of light-wood, for the purpose of sein-  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC8035-00000099"/> 200     THE UNFATHOMA BLE, MYSTERY. ing or spearing pickerel, which was against the law, I -thought I would follow, take them by surprise and at least 'have a little fun out of it. So, after I rode fairly past the path, I dismounted, tied my horse to a tree, and, going back to the path, entered it and softly proceeded on their track. After following a short distance, I came sonear them-as to obtain a'dim view of their persons, and to perceive they were just laying their burden down upon the ground, as if to rest or listen. I then suddenly , sprang forward to thespot, where they stood, and, giving lone of them a playful slap on the shoulder, exclaimed in a tone between sport and  earnest, "now, my lads, I've caught you!'"  At the same time  I thrust my hand down to get a grasp on the supposed rolled up seine or log of light-wood, when, instead of any thing of that kind, I caught hold of the clammy, cold and still limpsy hand of a dead man! Starting back horror struck, I stood several minutes without the power to stir or speak. The two men also seemed almost equally confounded, and stood, as if rooted in their tracks, peering at me, and looking nervously at each other. -As  soon as I recovered my faculties to do so, I tried to distinguish their faces and dress; when I made out enough to apprise me that they were none of those I suspected, but two men from the village, who were known to me by sight, as it seems I was to them. My next thought was to try to effect a precipitate retreat; and they probably saw something in   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      o01 me, or my slight motions, that caused them to suspect my intention; for one of them instantly sprang forward, roughly grasped me by the collar, and, in a sort of fierce, hoarse whisper, exclaimed, "You- can't go, sir--you have seen too mucht for our safety. You must die!" The- fear of death quickly restored to me my power of speech; and, in an agony of terror, I begged for mercy, implored them to spare my life, and I would never betray them. The man still held me strongly in his grasp; but his momentary silence and seeming hesitation after I had spoken, gave me a gleam of hope, which was increased shortly as he turned -his head and exchanged a few whis- pered words with his companion, the tone of whose re- plies I instinctively felt to be on the side of mercy. The man holding me then turned and hesitatingly said, "' If we could be sure- we should not be betrayed - if you would swear by all that is sacred, and you could make us believe you would forever keep your oath - per- haps - "Thus encouraged I eagerly interrupted him with fresh appeals for mercy, 'and, amidst sobs and tears, promised I would do all they required of me if they wVoud only spare my life. They then made me repeat over and over the most solemn and fearful oaths, that I would never let what I had seen or suspected, be known by word, hint or manner, to any human being, telling me that if I ever violated my oath, they would hunt me down and follow ilae   9$ "   &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC8035-00000100"/> 202     THE UNFATHOMABLE  MYSTERY. me to the ends of the earth, to kill me. After this, they urged me to accept of a share of the plunder they inti- mated they had obtained in the operations of the night. But I succeeded in evading the proposal; when, after saying they, or one of them would soon see me again, and that if I were true, they would give me all the mon- ey I wanted, they at length consented to let me depart. I then walked back nearly to the spot where I left my lorse; when it forcibly striking me that it was my best' policy to know what they did with the dead man, I turned about once more, and with careful and soft tread, stole back to the spot where I left the men. -But they were not there. They had taken up the corpse and departed. On listening intently, however, I could hear their steps, made heavier and more measured by the burden they were evidently bearing, as they toiled and staggered along the path some distance ahead. Being still determ- ined, to effect my object, I continued to follow them as cautiously as possible, moving when they moved, and stopping when they stopped, as they several times did to rest or consult, until I came near enough occasionally to discern their forms as they passed some of the lighter places, or openings among the trees. After a while they left the path, and, Striking off more directly towards the head of the little pond, they slowly made their way through the thickets till they came to a clump of white birch trees, immediately beyond which there was an open-   -   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.       203 ing, which admitted sufficient light to -enable me to dis- tinguish their persons and movements much more dis- tinctly. Near this spot there appeared to be a pit or hole, formed by the turning up of the roots of a tree, and approaching this cavity, they threw in the dead body, stamped it down as far as they could with their feet, and commenced covering it with dirt they kicked out from-the roots of the upturned tree, moss, and such rubbish as they could find near -at hand. I watched them till they had filled up the hole, and were beginning to throw over it leaves and old brush-wood; when I noiselessly withdrew, and, with hurried, trembling steps, made my way out of that fearful swamp to my horse,- mounted and rode rapid- ly homeward. When I had-reached there and put up my horse, I went directly to my sleeping room, threw off my clothes and jumped into bed, just as the house clock was striking two. But no one who has not passed through such a scene as I had, can imagine the state of my feel- ings. Such was my nervous agitation and continued dis- tress that I did not, and could not, sleep a single moment through the rest of that dreadful night. "This was Thursday night, and I heard nothing more of the affair, or the men engaged in it, until the next Sunday; when one of the men came along, and, hailing me, requested me to get into his wagon and take a ride with him to a tavern on the road several miles distant at the south. I consent- ed, but instead of keeping on in the main, direct road to  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC8035-00000101"/> 204    THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. the place he had named, he took me quite a number of miles over the hills, and in back roads, till he had passed considerably beyond the line of the tavern, which, when he had regained the main road, he approached from the other direction. When we reached the tavern, we be- spoke a private room under pretence of doing some busi ness without any liability of being disturbed; and having taken me into it, he locked the door, and at once broached the subject which was uppermost in both his mind and my own. Here he renewed his offer of money and other val- uable property, and his promises of more as often as I should desire it. But having,\ previous to this, thought over the matter, and made up my mind what course I would pursue if they called on me as was suggested when I parted with them, I insisted on having from them some writing to secure me against them in case that thereafter they might get into .some dilemma,-in which they might be tempted to combine in charging the crime on me. This, at first he refused to do; but, after awhile, he reluctantly consented, thinking probably it would be bad policy to thwart me in a matter in which I appeared so determined, and wrote a few lines in about these words "'If C. raneyhall shall sacredly and forever keep the secret we have entrusted to him, this shall entitle him to any money or other favors he can reasonably demand, and^ we hereby fully exonerate him from having any hand in, the transaction to which said secret refers.' '   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      205 "He then signed the paper with his own name, and that alpo of the other man, and delivered it to me, with a great many cautions about keeping it securely from every eye. "We then had some conversation about the deed itself, and the man who had been thus put out of the way; and as nigh as I could gather from his guarded replies to such questions as I ventured to ask, the victim was a foreigner, a rich old Scotch pedler, who, having stopped a day or two at the village and incautiously exposed his treasures, consisting of money, old gold, jewelry and costly satins, had been induced to com'e into the vicinity of the pond to look at some valuable horses, being in search of one for himself. After this, he, having talked over the matter as much as he wished, and advised me how- to shape my course, we left the tavern; and, taking another round- about route, he brought me back to my home." Craney having thus far gone on uninterrupted through the main part of his astounding disclosure, Mr. Bradley now began to take part in speaking on the subject; and a long conversation ensued between them, in which the for- mer further disclosed that since obtaining the writing above mentioned, he had often seen and conversed with the signers, and that he had received from them at differ- ent times several hundred dollars, besides some valuable goods, all which was promptly paid, or delivered, when asked for. At one time, one of them took him to his room and showed him a strong, and peculiarly made trunk, 7-  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC8035-00000102"/> 206     THE UNFATt!OMABLE MYSTERY. which he intimated was, with its rich contents, taken from the luckless pedler, and from which he took out a costly, flowered silk vest pattern and urged it on his acceptance. At other times one or both these men, had invited him to take journeys with, them to the cities at their expense; but this invitation he dared not accept, lest they should contrive when they got him so far from home, to have something fatal befal him. He also further stated, that these men had become very uneasy about the paper one of them had given him, and had often importuned him to give it up, which he had as often refused to do, knowing they would not dare to use any other means than entreaty to obtain it. He also said, " this secret had been a per- fect hell to him ever since he was master of it, and that it had already not only destroyed his peace of mind, but ruined his health, which was the principal reason why he had decided to give up farming for the lighter business of store keeping." After finishing his revelations, Craney offered to tell Mr. Bradley the names of the two men, whom his story had so deeply implicated, and to show him the paper he had received from them, which he said he hbd in a small bag or pocket, worn next his skin. But Mr. Bradley tell- ing him he did not wish to know who the men were, begged him to keep both their names and the paper to himself. Craney, however, persisted in giving such descriptions of the men as to lead Mr. Bradley to suppose he knew who they were.,   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      2 07 The next question discussed between Craney and Mr. Bradley, was, what course, under all the circumstances, ought then to be pursued, and as Craney, as innocent as he was of the crime originally, had implicated himself by his silence, and more so perhaps by receiving bribes" and portions of the booty; and as Mr. Bradley was strongly opposed to the punishment of death for crime, and as his sensibilities were touched at, the thought of being the means of plunging the innocent families of these crimi- nals into sorrow and disgrace by bringing them to the gal- lows, it was at length decided that the transaction should not be divulged, but kept, as it had been thus far, a pro- found secret from all not already apprised of it, and by way of appeasing Mrs. Nymore, whose suspicions of the truth, as before mentioned, had been aroused, -it was agreed that it should be hinted to her, that the secret Craney was concealing for others, related to a crim. con. case, or something of the kind.  This they supposed would relieve her'mind, and at the same time prevent her from pressing any further enquiries on the subject. When they reached Craney's destination, Mr. Bradley left him and returned alone to his sister's residence, where he continued to remain till Craney came back for a short visit, and during this visit the murder was made the sub- ject of another prolonged conversation; when Craney showed Mr. Bradley some hundred dollars in money, which he said was a part of the hush money he had re-  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC8035-00000103"/> 208     THE UNFATHOMABLE IMYSTERY ceived. He also, at this time, proposed to Mr. Bradley that they should both go into-the swamp together; when he would lead the way to the spot where the corpse was buried, and they would then dig down to it, that Mr. Bradley might see- proof of the truth of the disclosure that had been made to him.  The latter, however, de- clined going; when Craney gave a minute description of the localities of the spot and the path leading to it, so that if Mr. Bradley was afterwards disposed, he might go and find it alone. And Mr. Bradley did once, after Craney again left for his store, conclude he would go, and actually proceeded some distance with a hoe in hand to- wards the designated spot; but feeling that he knew he should find the remains, and it occurring to him that his visit to the place might attract attention and lead to in- quiry, he turned about and went home without entering the swamp at all. Mr. Bradley now soon returned to New Orleans; when a correspondence- relating mainly to the murder or mat- ters growing out of it, was opened with him by Craney, who wrote three or four letters on the subject. In all these letters, he steadily, and without the slightest in- consistency of statement persisted in re-affirming the truth of all he had verbally communicated to Mr. Bradley in Vermont, adding several particulars, which, as he said, he had before unintentionally omitted, and describing his further dealings with the men-whose secret he was keep- \     '   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      209 ing. In one of his later letters he expressed the liveli- est concern respecting the fate of two letters which he had previously written, but which, as it appeared he had just been informed, had never reached their destination, saying that those letters contained. enough, if made pub- lic, to ruin him. In another later letter, he stated he had been into the swamp,-dug into the grave and ascer- tained the remains were still there. He also told Mr. Bradley that, agreeably to his former advice, he had set- tled matters with the two men in question, and, 'with- out giving up his writing, had received one thousand dollars, a sum which was none too large, since they ob- tained in the transaction, as he believed, money and proper- ty to the amount of ten-or twelve thousand dollars, and he further said that he had made up his mind that now he would take his thousand dollars, go with it to some part of the western country and settle there; so that he might get away from every thing that could remind him of an affair, which had caused him so much unhappiness; and lastly, some months afterwards, he wrote to Mr. Bradley, that the store, in which he had been employed, with all its contents, had been destroyed by fire, and that all his money with his talismanic writing, which he had concealed in a certain cavity he had made for the purpose in the cellar wall, had gone with the rest, and in conse- quence of this misfortune, he had given up his intention of going West, and had obtained a place in a store in the northern part of the state, where he was then residing.  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC8035-00000104"/> 210     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. Such were the extraordinary disclosures, which young Craney made to Mr. Bradley in Vermont, personally, and subsequently by letter, and which the latter, as be- fore stated, revealed to the Governor's Secretary, togeth- er with some hints in regard to the identity of one or both the perpetrators of the alleged crime. And we will now return to note the accion of the latter in the in- vestigation, to which he now returned with the purpose of immediately instituting. On reaching home, the Secretary caused a warrant for the arrest of Craney to be taken out and put into the hands of a sheriff, who, with an assistant, promptly start- ed off for the town where the young man was residing. They reached the place late at night and put up at a talv- ern, near the store in which Craney was employed. On ascertaining that the latter slept in the store, the assist- ant, who was an old acquaintance of the young man, vol- unteered to go to the store- and induce him to come over to the tavern. With this object in view, the assistant proceeded at once to the store, and at length succeeded in awakening the object of his search, who presently came to the door, when almost the first words he; uttered were the rapidly plied questions "What is the news? - Has any thing broke out in B--?" Having evaded the questions, or answered in a manner that seemed to allay the obvious apprehensions of Craney, the assistant invited the other to the tavern to   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.       2" transact some business, there to be explained; when the two proceeded to a private room taken by the sheriff for the purpose in hand. As soon as they were all in the room together, the assistant announced the true business on which he and the sheriff had come; when Craney be- came terribly agitated, stared wildly around the room, threw up his hands in a sort of spasmodic tremor, and re- treating backward, sunk nearly fainting, into a chair in the corner of the room. And it was a long time before they could get him into a condition to speak at all. But at length succeeding in calming him down in some meas- ure, they urged him, for his own safety, to make a clean breast of it, and divulge the whole story. He at length replied that he Would tell them -all the facts, but could not consent to give up the names of the perpetrators. And he accordingly went on and related, with little or no variation, the same story which he had related to Mr. Brad- ley, and that too, evidently,&amp; without the least suspicion that the latter had disclosed the secret, concluding by con- fidently stating he could go to the very spot where the murdered man was buried. The sheriff and his assistant then renewedly pressed him to give up the names of the perpetrators; when, after awhile, he mentioned the names of two individuals, who were obviously not the persons hinted at by Mr. Bradley, and whose characters were such as to render it highly improbable that they'could have had any connection with the transaction.        .!  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC8035-00000105"/> 212     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. After this, the three started for the village, where the Court of Inquiry, for the legal investigation of the sup- posed murder was to be held, Craney going in close cus- tody of the sheriff. During all the first part of the journey, and indeed until they had reached their last halting place at an inn about eight miles from their des- tination, QCraney persisted in his story, adding, from time to time. as they went on, numerous little circum- stances, all seeming to go in confirmation of what he had before related. But during their brief halt at this inn, the Sheriff took Craney aside, and, whether warranted in so doing or not, commenced a little investigation, it would seem, on his own hooks saying, "Now we want to know what we are to depend on- what you are going to testify before the court. We are Satisfied you have lied to us so far as relates to the names yolu have given as the names of the men who were per- petrators of the crime you allege to have been committed; and we wish to know whether your whole story is not equally false throughout?" To this Craney, at the time, made no reply. But it was soon evident, that the Sheriff's unexpected question had suggested a course for, him, which had not before en- tered his mind, and as they were on the point of leaving the tavern to resume their journey, he called the assistant out of the room and said, "the whole story was one of my own making up, and was all false."   THE 'UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      213 He was then, as they were proceeding on their way, questioned as to his motives in telling such a tale, and asked what had occurred to suggest it? After some hesi- tation and delay, he said that. at the time and place, he had given in his story, he did indeed see two men enter the swamp, carrying something on their shoulders, which, after a moment's consideration he decided to be a log of light-wood intended to be split up into torches and used for spearing pickerel. But while riding home, he began to suppose a case, like the one, which, at the first instant he had thought this to be--that of foul play and attempt at concealing by hurrying away the body of the victim into the woods.  And shortly after, wishing to know whether a friend of his, living in thq same family (the young mechanic before mentioned) could keep a secret, he hinted his knowledge of such a deed as the above named circumstance had suggested. And when his friend contrary to promise; told Mrs. Nymore what he had hint- ed, and she questioned him about it, he thought he must patch up a story to avoid being detected in a falsehood, and thus he continued to do, till he got it into the shape in which he told it to Mr. Bradley. He also said in re- ply to the question put to him, respecting the hush money he had told Mr. Bradley he had received, that it was a sum entrusted to him by the store keeper,- with whom he was engaged, to pay over to a certain'Mr. D. of the vi- cinity. flltr  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC8035-00000106"/> 214     THE UNFATHOMABLE IMYSTERY. But to the question also put to him, why he had of- fered to take Mr. Bradley to the spot where the mur- dered man was buried, and dig into the grave till they came to the corpse or bones, to put the truth of his story to the test, he did not attempt to frame any reply. Such was the unsatisfactory explanation which Craney now gave of his conduct; and under this new aspect of the affair, the party arrived in the village when the Sheriff placed his charge in jail to be ready to respond with his presence to the call of the court whenever it should be made. The next morning after the party had arrived at the village. and the culprit had been safely lodged in jail, the Sheriff, his assistant, and the Secretary and others who had been enlisted in aid of the prosecution, deeming it advisable, under the altered aspect the case had now as- sumed, to delay the court a few days, to see what other testimony could be obtained, set off for the locality where the supposed crime was committed. They visited Mrs. Nymore, who expressed her surprise that Craney should have proclaimed his story to be fictitious, and intimated that, by so doing, he had but added to his crimes. Push- ing their inquiries further,'they found four different in- dividuals, to whom, in confidence he had imparted so much of his secret as related to the writing, by which he could command money at his pleasure, and by way of making good his assertions he had shown to each of them,   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      S15 at different times, rolls of bank bills which were obvious- ly ot large amounts. Among these persons was a broth- er of Craney, who admitted he knew his brother's secret, that he had often seen in his hands large sums of money, of which, had he chosen he might have become to a consider- able extent a sharer. The party then entered the great Cedar Swamp, so often mentioned in this narrative, but ma-de no- discovery, being unable to find any place answering to the one Cra- ney had described as the locality of the grave. The next day they visited the Swamp again, taking Craney and his keeper along with them. And having gone some distance into it, they requested the young man to show them the place he had described to Mr. Bradley. He pre- tended to comply, and finally led them to a place which' he said was the one in question. But there was no ap- pearance there, or anywhere in the vicinity, of any grave, pit, or other depository, where a human body could -have been ever buried, and it having been hinted by some pres- ent, who were best acquainted with the Swamp, and who had been watching Craney, that he had purposely misled the party, his keeper was directed to take him away. A further, but equally fruitless search was then made; after which the party, with their prisoner, all returned to the village. It should also be stated in this connection, perhaps, that during these days of unofficial inquiry, it was found true  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC8035-00000107"/> 216     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. that the store-keeper, with whom Craney lived the year of Mr. Bradley'si visit to Vermont, did, on one occasion, entrust the young man with one or two hundred dollars to pay over, as the latter claimed to a Mr. D--, who promptly acknowledged its receipt. But it did not appear probable that it was the same that had been displayed to any of the four individuals above mentioned. If it was, it could not have been shown but to one of them, and could not have been one quarter of the amount he had shown at different times to those four individuals, during that season or afterwards. But this fact, however much he might have claimed it to prove his innocence, seemed to be more that counterbalanced by the account which both the store keeper and his wife gave of Craney's sin- gular conduct while living with them. They stated that he appeared to be wretched, always nervous, and apprehen- siye of some danger to himself, never daring to go out after dark,: and only in the most frequented ways in the day time, claiming that he had been shot at with a bullet that barely escaped his head; while the only explanation he would give for his apprehensions consisted in his re- peated hints that " there were certain men in the country who had a great interest in putting him out of the way." The Court of Inquiry was now held. The sheriff and his assistant then gave their testimony in detail relating' to the arrest of the prisoner - his exclamations, fainting and great agitation, when the cause of his arrest was an-   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      217 nounced to him - his ready admissions of the truth of all the disclosures he had made to Mr. Bradley, and his sub- sequent denial of the truth of the whole story, and all the other particulars which we have before related in ref- erence to that part of our- narrative. Considerable dis- cussiori then ensued between those acting in behalf of the government, and the counsel, whom the prisoner had, in the meanwhile, employed to conduct his defence; when the difficulties attending the further prosecution of the case, under the new aspect which it was made to assume by the prisoner's denials, soon became apparent. If it was attempted to make Craney a -witness against others, he would now of course refuse to implicate any one, and there the matter must end. And if he was, tried as an accessory after the fact, the first step to be made out in such a prosecution, was wanting- -no murder was established.. The sitting magistrates, consequently, though they con- sidered the young man-s conduct wholly unaccountable, and his explanations of it unsatisfactory, did not feel themselves justified in binding him over, for trial, and he was therefore discharged. But being still kept under surveillance, he was, a few days afterwards, brought be- fore the Grand Jury of the county, put upon his oath and closely examined in relation to the crime he had till very recently, alleged to have been to his knowledge. commit- ted. But he here also persisted in his last story. But though his examiners felt themselves rather baffled than 10  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC8035-00000108"/> 218     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. satisfied, they were yet compelled to let him depart, and leave the affair more deeply veiled in mystery than ever. He then immediately left town and returned to his resi- dence from which he had been taken. Thus ended all that could be strictly considered the legal proceedings in this remarkable case. But inquiry and investigation in relation to the subject" were not suf- fered to stop here. Many had been dissatisfied with the manner in which the prosecution had been conducted, and what they believed to be the lack of honest endeavor to bring the truth to light. They believed further, that Craney would never have denied the truth of his former revelations, had not the sheriff put the words of denial into his mouth, or in other terms, indirectly suggested, if not advised it. And among those who had been thus made dissatisfied, and who believed in the truth of Craney's first story, was the intelligent and sagacious gentleman who had then just been elected governor of the state, and among  his first official acts was- the appointment of a special agent to investigate the case anew, the fact of- the appointment and the name of the agent to be closely kept from all knowledge-of the public. Thus authorized, the new agent soon secretly commenced his inquiries and observations. And, in consequence of information he received of the brief sojourn in, and then of the unexpectedly continued absence of a certain pedler from, a town about twenty miles northerly of the locality          , 2-   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.     219 of the supposed murder, this agent visited that town, traced out the boarding house of the pedler, and soon succeeded in ascertaining from its trustworthy mistress the following facts : - "That a few weeks previous to the time at which it is said a murder was committed in the town of B---, a Scotch pedler came there making her house his head- quarters, while trading round town; - that by his good nature and honest simplicity he made himself quite a favorite among the neighbors, with whom he mingled on the most familiar terms, treating all as old friends, and on her especially appearing to bestow the most unlimited con- fidence;- that in one of his confidential moods, he one day brought out and showed her what he called his great treasure, which, to her great surprise, consisted of more than a quart--nearer two quarts she thought--of old gold beads and rings, which it seemed he had a pen- chant for accumulating, obtaining them in trade instead of money, but which, on being warned against showing lest he be robbed, he hastily put away and never showed or spoke of again. And that, finally, having remained in the place about a fortnight, besides his other trading, he sold on trust two costly satin dresses, which were to be paid for on his return in about three weeks; and de- parted in the direction of the village and the town of B--, and was never heard of afterwards." The next piece of information having a direct bearing  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC8035-00000109"/> 220     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. on the case under investigation was derived from a farmer and occasional teamster, living in the borders of the town adjoining the town of B--, on the south, and about four miles from the locality of the alledged murder. Learning that this person was firmly convinced that a murder was committed, at the time, and in the manner disclosed by Craney to Mr. Bradley, the agent visited him and received from him the following. statement made in the presence of his wife, and fully confirmed by her. "I had been to the village to get part of a load of produce to take to Boston for the merchants S. S. &amp; Co., for whom I was to bring back a full load of goods. This was in the fore-part of the evening of the night on which the foul deed you are inquiring about, happened. I know it to have been the same, because it was always under- stood in the neighborhood, that something strange hap- pened to young Craney that-night; and because, as it now seems, he confessed to Mr. Bradley, he met the young men at the tavern to choose managers for a ball; and on calling at the tavern I found them there for that purpose. Well, when I had reached home and lit a lantern, to un- harness by, I discovered, to my vexation, that one of my horses had lost a shoe, which would compel me to go back to the corner to get another put on before I could start for Boston, as I was intending to do very early the next morning.- So, rising with the first signs of day, the next morning, I mounted the horse that needed shoeing and   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      221 rode rapidly towards the blacksmith's. By the time I had reached the great Cedar Swamp, it had become broad day-light; and as I approached the northerly end of it, my attention was attracted by something unusual in the appearance of the road at the point where an old half over-grown timber path struck off obliquely into the swamp.  Here the road, especially on the swamp side, was all marked over with foot prints, turned in various directions and deeply indented into the earth, -showing the short stepping, backing and twisting of booted feet, with other evidences of a fierce struggle, which must, as the new and fresh appearance of every thing indicated, have occurred during the night. My curiosity was so much raised by these unusual appearances, that I dis- mounted and was examining them anew; when stepping towards the cart ruts on the swamp side of the road, I was horrified in beholding a pool of fresh looking- blood, which had been shed in such quantity as to overflow the rut and run several feet down the bank beyond. I no- ticed, also, that the grass and bushes had been bespattered by blood some distance along the old path running into the woods. In strong excitement, I mounted my horse, rode on to the blacksmith's shop and told the people there that a murder had certainly been committed the past night, back on the road near the edge of the great Cedar -Swamp, urging some of them to go back with me and examine the spot s- But they would not go, nor believe S  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC8035-00000110"/> 222     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. in any murder, saying that the blood I had seen probably came from a dog or some other animal that had been killed there. When I .went by the place, on my return, the same appearances were still visible, though the sun having risen and shofie on the spot, the blood had lost its fresh color so that, with'those not on the look out for something of the kind, it would not have been very likely to have attracted notice. "When I reached home, the first thing I said to my wife was to tell her there had :been a murder committed on the edge of the great Cedar Swamp, the night before, which would be out doubtless before I returned from Boston, though she perhaps better say nothing about it. And on my reaching home from Boston, the first words I said to her, were to ask her if " that murder was out yet?-" The next discovery that the agent made. was one which induced him to suspect there was a third man con- nected with the crime, who did not appear ever to have been known to Craney, but who, probably, was the one to give the fatal blow, his more Cowardly or cunning instiga- tors staying in the back-ground till the deed was done, then, advising him to keep aloof, going forward themselves to secure the plunder and secrete the corpse. This man was an Irishman of a rough and doubtful character, who, ot the time of the suspected murder, lived as a hostler at the tavern at the Corners in B--, but who soon disap- peared and was not heard of till the next summer, when i   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      -  8 he was accidently seen by one of the residents of B--, at work on a farm in a neighboring town about a dozen miles distant. His whereabouts having been thus ascer- tained, the agent visited the place and received from the intelligent old farmer, for whom the man had worked, but subsequently ran away, the following significant state- ment:- "The fellow you inquire about, I consider to have been at least a very dubious character. I soon perceived that there must be something wrong in the maia. He seemed to be'very suspicious and apprehensive that somebody was, or would be, after him. He would never leave the house after dark; and if he ever went any distance from home, he always went secretly armed with a small dirk-like bayonet I had in the house. His mind seemed continu- ally running on murders; and he was often supposing cases of the kind, his object evidently being to find out what proof it required to hang a man. One day as my wife went to his room to make -his bed, she found his trunk, which he had ever before kept locked up, standing wide open; when spying a piece of costly satin goods, she, in the way of inspecting so unlooked for an article in the hands of a rough Irishman, raised end of one it from its'place, and to her greater surprise, beheld a quan- tity of gold beads and rings. Seeing now the reason why he had kept his trunk so carefully locked, and fearing he would suspect. she. had looked into his trunk, if he  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC8035-00000111"/> 224     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. knew she had been into the room, she concluded she would defer making the bed, and so left every thing as before, and went down.   But she had searcely done so, before he came in, and in an excited manner, rushed up stairs, locked his trunk, and went out again without making, however, any excuse for coming into the house. My wife and I, who discussed all this between ourselves, thought it a most strange and suspicious circum- stance, -but agreed to keep our own council. He had now been with me six or eight months, and what was cu- rious was the fact that all that time he had never be- trayed, by word or hint, anything about him last residence, having held out to me that he came from a neighboring state. But an incident now soon occurred which gave me new light on the subject, and was the means, as it would seem, of my losing my hired man. A former ac- quaintance of mine, living in the town of B , came to see me on business, and having seen my Irishman in the yard and knowing him, told me he was the same man that had lived the year before with the tavern keeper in B   , and he further told me that there were strange ru- mors afloat'in B  that some foul deed had been commit- ted the fall before in the vicinity ofthe tavern. This, coup- led with what I had seen in the Irishman, set me thinking anew; but I said nothing to him about it after my friend was gone. He, howevery it appeared, took the alarm without any words of mine; for that very night, he ran   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.      225 away, having carried his trunk'on his shoulder, and taken my little dirk-bayonet along with it." Such were the main pieces of circumstantial evidence, which the agent collected in the course of his inquiries. But with these he became also possessed of a knowledge of a great many other circumstances tending to the same point which, though many of them might be termed mere straws, yet it was wonderful to see how universally and certainly those straws all pointed in one and only one di- rection - and that was to the commission of the crime, at the time and place that had been alledged. Among the last named class of circumstances, was the well ascertained one, that all the connections of the fam- ily, with whom Craney had lived, and with whom he still kept up the closest intimacy, were unanimous and decided in their belief in the truth of his first story, and in the conviction, that his subsequent denial of it was made only with the object of thereby-escaping prosecution, which he was evidently fearful would be instituted against him, in- stead of merely using him as a witness. Allfthis, indeed, he distinctly stated to the two or three of the confiden- tial friends who, as before intimated, were partially initia- ted. into his secret, had been shown his hush money, and who had severely censured him for denying .what he now admitted to be the truth. Having now collected as much of this corroborative testimony as he deemed sufficient for present purposes, the 10*  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC8035-00000112"/> 226     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. agent's next object was, to devise some way of putting ' himself in communication with Craney, to induce him to disclaim his' denial, made about the time of the Court of Inquiry, as it was believed he would, when apprised of the recent discoveries of the facts above enumerated, and, confronted with his own admissions on the subject; then, still further induce him to take the indispensable step of assisting in good faith to find the remains of the mur- dered man; so that the existence of such remains so found buried or concealed might be legally established by com- petent witnesses. With this object in view, he sought an interview with Craney's father, and opened the subject to him. The old gentleman was, at first, shy about the matter, and framed all his replies with great caution and reserve, being evi- dently apprehensive that his son might be brought into trouble in' consequence of the affair. Being convinced that lie knew much more of the .matter in question than he pretended; and that he was only prevented from disclos- ing what he knew by fear of involving his son, the agent made the proposition that young Craney should pay a visit of a week to his old home in B -- , go into the swamp, find the remains- of the murdered ,man, then call ,in the aid of a confidential friend and his father, who should disinter the remains- and remove them to a place of safety; when Craney should return to his residence near- Canada line, or pass over into Canada if necessary, and there re-   liUci  I V'XATj Mnvru j  -ax L. main till a strong, and safely written guaranty from the proper authorities that he should not be prosecuted, should be brought him; and that he should come there, and ap- pearing as a witness before a Court of Inquiry, should make a full disclosure, and point out the perpetrators of the crime in question; who, in the meanwhile, were to be arrested and brought into court for the purpose. As soon as the old gentleman could be made to com- prehend this plan, and especially as soon as he was con- vinced his son might safely do what was proposed, he seized the agent's hand and exclaimed, "It shall be done! I have for months and months told my wife I would give anything if that wicked deed could all be brought to light. The secret'is killing my son-- killing us all. Yes sir, it shall be done." And it was done. The old gentleman and one of the intimate friends before mentioned, conjointly wrote to young Craney, who at length entered, in evident good faith, into the arrangement, came home and spent the successive days of nearly a week in searching the Cedar Swamp. He found no difficulty in finding and identify- ing the spot where the murdered man was buried, and spent the first day in removing the rubbish and digging down into the grave, till he had cleaned it out to the original bottom of the cavity. But he found nothing save some slight shreds of clothing, and a.'few scattered 'hairs;-just enough to remove the last doubt, if any  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC8035-00000113"/> 228     THE. UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. such he had, entertained, that this was the spot where the corpse was buried. The remains were not found; and believing they had not been removed to any great dis- tance, but were still to be found concealed in some part of the swamp, he continued his search, day after day, for about a week, till he had examined every spot, where they could have possibly been buried, or concealed; but all in vain, and he at last gave over the search under the full conviction that the bones or remains, whatever state they might have. been, had all been dug up and carried away out of the swamp to some place unknown. All this through the medium already named, he reported to the agent and asked what more waslto be done; saying that if no new prosecution was to be instituted, he hoped he might be spared&amp; disclosing the names of the perpetrators, which he said he had never yet definitely done so as to be rightly understood. An answer was returned that as the attempt to discover the remains had resulted in a failure, no prosecution could be instituted with any hope of a suc- cessful termination; and none unless some new discovery were made, would therefore be commenced ; and it might be better, as the case stood, to keep the names to himself, and let the whole subject, if he could, be banished from his mind.              ' There is but one additional circumstance to be added to the history of this case -to which, the reader may attach, any, importance which he pleases. But as it   THE UNFATHOMABLj! MYSTERY.      229 may be claimed, by some, to be a part of that his- tory, it shall be briefly stated. Two clairvoyants, both boys, and wholly unknown to each other, were, by one of the agent's assistants consulted, in their mesmeric state, respecting the supposed murder, in the town of B   , and severally asked, at different times and places, what they could see in relation to any such transaction., They both, singularly enough, told in substance the same story. They said they saw a man knocked down with a club by one man, and seized by two others, carried off and buried in the dark woods near a large piece of water; but was, afterwards dug up, carried out on the water, in a boat, and sunk. They both agreed on this, and one of them said, in addition, that -while the two men were burying the corpse, the one who struck the blow took the horse and wagon belonging to the murdered man, and drove off with it to a distant part of the town, and to an obscure, out of the way place, where he left it. And strange to relate it was ascertained, on inquiry, that, at the place, and about the time named by the clairvoyant, an ordinary horse and wagon was found without any owner, and for which no owner ever afterwards appeared. Thus ends our account of this extraordinary case, - a case for which, as regards all its prominent features, a parallel can scarcely be found among the records of the past. If we assume as a fact that a murder was actually committed,- we have just glimpse enough of the dark  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC8035-00000114"/> 230     THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY. transaction to see, that it stands invested with all the romantic horrors in which the wildest fancy could have clothed it; while, at the same time, all further light re- specting the crimes or its cold-blooded perpetrators, seems impenetrably closed to our view. If, on the contrary, we take the ground that no murder was committed, we find it almost utterly impossible to reconcile young Craney's conduct with any known principle of human action. That he might have invented such a story and told it tp a companion one day, and proclaimed it a joke the next ; or, even that, for some object, he might have had the dis- position and skill to make a credulous person believe it for months, we can easilyj enough conceive. But that, with only ordinary capacities and tact, he should, or could, invent, with all its minutiae, this revolting tale; give direct clues to it to four or five individuals; tell it, in all seriousness and apparent anguish of feeling, to a keen business man, as was Mr. Bradley, and find implicit credit; - offer to show hin! the remains of the victim, and thus propose to do what must necessarily detect him in a falsehood, and then reiterate the story through a long correspondence;- that he should grow nervous and pine away under a story of his own invention; that he came honorably by the large sums of money he was known to possess; that he should have been seized with such terror and struck dumb when arrested, and all in consequence of a fictitious story got up by himself with no apparent mo- J,.   THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY.       231' tive, is, indeed difficult, extremely difficult, to believe. Nor is it less difficult, on the supposition that no murder was committed, to account for that singular chain of con- curring facts and mutually corroborating circumstances, which the patient persistence of the last appointed agent brought to light, in any manner which reason or proba- bility could sanction. And yet we are compelled to leave the subject here, and call it, as those best acquainted with the facts hlave always done, at least an Unfathomable Mystery.  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC8035-00000115"/> THE RUSTIC -FINANCIERS. Among all the curious and cunning devices ever con- cocte d to make money without legitimate means, not one, perhaps, can be found which surpasses, in originality and shrewdness, a scheme got up for that purpose, and success- fully carried out, some twenty years ago,- in one of the in- terior towns of Vermont, called COZY CORNERS, by three men, known by the several names of Riah Cutefight, Bill Versute, and Eph Equivoke, the surnames being nick- names bestowed by an odds and crafty old pettifogger of the place; who, in turn, was dubbed by -them Runa Rasp'em. The tavern bar-room,- that standing Elysium of small, country village loungers,--had long been the head-quarters of the above named trio. At one of their meetings at this place on a stormy evening, when the inclemency of the weather kept all other company from the house, Riah Cutefight, the leading spirit of the three, who had been for some time in a deep study, suddenly aroused himself, and bringing down his palm with a smart slap on his knee, exultingly exclaimed:   --THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS.     233 "I have it. Yes, sirs, I have it! It is done!" "What is it you have? and what is it tliat's done?" asked his companions, looking at him in surprise. "The new plan I've been studying out for accomplish- ing what we three have so often talked about," replied the former, glancing round doubtfully at the sleeping landlord. "Talkit out," said Bill Versute. "No risk from that source." "I don't know about that," rejoined Cutefight, shaking his head. "-It will be more prudent to hold in till we get out of all ear-shot on our way home." "But it will do no hurt to kind'er suppose a case, so as to give us a sort of general idea of your scheme; no matter if it is a little blind. I can guess it out," re- marked Equivoke, who, as his name implies, was himself a dealer in ambiguities. "Then, to strike at once at the root- of the matter, I make the supposition that, every man has in him  a chZunk of human nature as big as a woodchuck. Don't laugh, I'm serious. That simple fact forms the base of my whole scheme." Ah? And there are always certain points of that chunk that we can seize on, and turn to our advantage?" "That is quite an idea- I begin to see. We'll have a plan out of it, if you have it not already." "But I have a regular plan; and have pretty much decid- b.                     &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC8035-00000116"/> 284      THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS. ed how to carry it out in the details, and old Rasp'em will tell us how to keep clear of legal snags. Let us be off now, and stop at Versute's house, when you shall have my -whole plan which we will discuss, and then agree on a time to begin operations," added Cutefight, as the three donned their fox-skin caps, and- left the tavern. On the t rd morning after this, Cutefight and Versute were seen, with considerable appearance of stealth, mak- ing their way, in the one horse team of the former, out of the village, up the road northward, on some unknown des- tination. As these men had, ever before, been quite open- mouthed about all their movements, and had now gone off without saying a word about it, though evidently equipped for a considerable journey, their departure at once at- tracted general attention. And many were the queries and 'conjectures raised among the curious and wondering villagers respecting the cause and character of the unusu- al movement; but nobody could throw any light upon the subject. In this dilemma, Eph Equivoke, who, having been selected by his confederates to play a necessary part in the game afoot,-now made his appearance in the street, was appealed to-on all sides to aid in explaining the sin- gular affair. But he, though supposed to know every- body's business, and especially that of the two men in question; appeared as much in the dark as any of them; thought it looked rather suspicious, and finally recalled certain curious circumstances, which he could not name,   THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS.       235. but which were enough to enable him "to form his own opinions on the matter." These dark hints and surmises, coming as they did from one who would be most likely to hit on the truth, instead of explaining, only increased the mystery, which there- upon, for the next three days, became the chief staple of conversation among the good people of Cozy Corners. At the close of the third day, however, the affair was destined to assume a new aspect, but one which was little calculated to allay the excitement it-had already occasioned. Just at dark, on that day, the two absentees were seen to be approaching at a slow pace along the road, in which they had departed, and walking by the side of their team, as if the load was too heavy to permit of, their riding. On reaching the Corners, they drove up to the tavern door, and called out the landlord. "Landlord, can you store for us, a few days, that half a barrel of flour?" said Cutefight, with an air of mysteri- ous privacy as he pointed to a half barrel in their wagon, visibly marked with a well-known flour brand. O, yes, certainly, Mr. Cutefight." "But haven't you some empty room, which can be locked up, to put it in, so that it can be perfectly safe?" "Why, yes - if you say so; but what need -" "Well, we have our own reasons; but all- right, as you say you can put it under lock and key; Versute, let us see if we can get it into the house,'  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC8035-00000117"/> 286      THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS. The two men took strong hold on the ends of the cask, lifted it out with much seeming effort, and, sta ggering along with it to the door, followed the landlord to a back- room, where they deposited the precious burden, locked the door, took the key, and hurrying out, drove off home with the-air of men anxious to avoid all chance of being questioned. - Now make me believe, if you can, that there is noth- ing but flour in that cask they just- tugged in there," significantly remarked Equivoke to those who, like him- self, had gradually edged up near enough to see and hear all that had transpired. "So say I - and I," promptly responded others. "It. is evidently too heavy to be only flour; and then they have been so sly- and secret! But what can it be they've got in the cask?" "Maybe they've robbed some bank, and got the specie," suggested one. "Maybe they've found a mine of solid gold," re- marked another. f "And maybe, too, they've got a lot of counterfeit hard money," added Equivoke, in a tone and look of peculiar meaning. This last intimation, which evidently at once struck all as affording the best explanation of the suspicious affair, caused a lively sensation among the crowd - some shak- ing their heads and sating nothing; some suggesting an   THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS,      237 immediate movement for the arrest of, the suspected -men; but the greater number advocating delay till the counter- feit money had been passed. And so, they all now soon dispersing, thoughtfully took their way to their respective homes. The next morning; Cutefight and Versute came to the tavern, and after being alone awhile in the room where the mysterious cask was deposited, came out into the  e street, and listlessly sauntered along into the store; when, taking the storekeeper aside, and pulling out a dozen half-dollars, they quietly asked -him if he would like to buy them. "No - can't go into that game," forbidingly mut- tered the storekeeper, full of the prevailing suspicion. "But you can examine them can't you?" said Cute- fight, with composure. "Well-- yes," replied the other, hesitatingly, taking the proffered coins, and carefully subjecting them to the usual tests of ringing them on the counter, paring their edges, etc. "Why," he at length resumed, in surprise, " these, at least, are all good. You meant, I suppose, to ask me to exchange them for other money?" "O,- no-it was a sale we proposed. We don't ex- pect to get the par value for those, nor the rest of our stock of the same kind now on hand, or to be on hand ac- cording to the encouragement we meet with in sales. But  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC8035-00000118"/> 288      THE RUSTIC: FINANCIERS. seeing they pass muster so well with you, suppose you give us -say about seventy-Ave cents on the dollar for this little lot. Will you do it? A "Why-well-y-e-s-yes; I don't know     why I should not, if you really wish it. Let's see - twelve halves, six wholes, and six quarters off, leaves $4 50; and here it is. But now recollect, it was your own offer; r jk so don't hereafter say I cheated you." "Be sure not. And, oh our part, we wish you here- after to recollect that we did not pass, or or'er to pass, those pieces to you for good money, but only sold them." With this, the two hard money venders went off, leav- ing the storekeeper completely at a loss what to make f the affair, and not a little doubtful about the propriety of his own course. -And, like other men in similar predica- ments, he was anxious for the opinions of others; so he called in some particular friends, related all that had oc- ; curred, and with them examined anew the money, which they all, at length, agreed were nothing else than genuine silver half dollars. And these men going out, soon spread the news, which brought in others, and yet others, to go through the same process; till, before night, every man, woman and child of the village had the exciting subject in full discussion. But not one of them all could give any satisfactory solution of the mystery where the money came from, or how it was obtained. On the following day, Equivoke, who had the day be- g    THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS,.      39 fore purposely .absented himself from the village, that everything might be thoroughly discussed without his help, and not appear to be hurried, carelessly entered the store to learn the news, he said, when he was shown the. money in question, and informed of all that bad taken place. He appeared to be both surprised and gratified to- find the-money, so contrary to what he should have ex- pected, to be unquestionably genuine; was convinced he had wrongly suspected these men, who, after all, probably had never had any notion of entering on any lawful en-- terprise. They might have, somehow, got honest access to some great treasure; and, if so, it would be a matter of interest to the whole village. He was resolved to know more of the business. If a slower of money Was about to fall on the place, he wanted to know- it, so he could hold up his cap for a share. He would soon visit Riah and Bill, and find out something about it, and see on what terms they would let others in as sharers. The words of Equivoke, who by his course had warded off all suspicion of any complicity of his own in the affair now evidently made a deep impression on his listeners; and they all urged him to make his proposed; visit without delay. And being thus solicited, he at length promised that, though he would have liked a little more time to think of it, he yet would go the coming evening, and meet them all at the store, the next morning, to report his discoveries. 4  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC8035-00000119"/> 240      THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS. Punctual to his appointment, Equivoke made his ap- pearance the next morning at the store, where the com- pany of yesterday, and most of all the other men of the village with them, had already assembled to hear the promised report. "Got to give it up," said he, in response to the inquir- ing glances of the company; "was on good terms with Riah and Bill, certainly, before they took to being by themselves so much, and felt sure I could get all I wanted out of 'em. But as to their main secret, they keep their mouths as close as clams. " "But did you get no clue to it? nothing out of all their talk to enable you to form a pretty close guess about the truth of the case?" asked the store-keeper, as spokes- man for the rest. "No, not as to where the money came from, or how they first got track of it." "Then you believe there really is money they can get when they please?"' "Yes, enough to make every man at Cozy Corners rich as mud." "Then why don't they go and get it, or let somebody else do it?" ' Just what I told them, which brought them out a little, and they at length admitted that it required con-, siderable capital to operate to advantage, though for every dollar they pay out, they are sure to get more than twenty   THE RUSTIC rFINANCIERS.      241 in return. And the reason they don't go fully into it immediately, is the lack- of such capital which they hope to get soon, when they will begin operations on a large scale." ' But how about letting in others for a chance? '; "Well, they hung off a good deal at first, being na- turally anxious to get it all for themselves, but at last came round as fair as I could expect. And I finally suc- ceeded in getting their promise to let in a select number provided they would raise them, within a month, an amount large enough to make it worth while to go into it. I shall subscribe for a full share, or $100, which I think I can raise securities for borrowing. I shall advise no man to it, lest, if the thing don't turn out, well he might blame me.  But I shall give every man a chance to join who wants to, in a private way; for the whole move had better be kept as secret as possible." So saying, Equivoke, with the elated and restless air of one having important business to attend to, bade his eager listeners good morning. and hurried away into the street. After he left, the company sat some time, musing in silence, as if debating in mind a question on which they cared not to express themselves openly; when one after another, they all quietly rose and left the' store, and before Shat day's sun had sets every one of them, watching his opportunity in the street, had taken Equivoke aside "  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC8035-00000120"/> 242      THE. RUSTIC FINANCIERS. and requested him to put them down for the amount re- quired to make them full sharers in the enterprise. From this time, all public discussion on the subject, which, for the past few days, had caused so much agita- tion, seemed strangely to subside. But though such was the outward aspect, yet everything tended to show that the scheme was being as rapidly, as it was silently, pushed forward to the grand consummation. Equivoke, for the next two or three weeks, seemed to be everywhere, and everywhere equally busy; though none but the initiated could divine the character of his business; for he not on- ly kept a close mouth himself, but enjoined secrecy on all others to whom he disclosed his projects. So well, in- deed, was all this managed by him, that none of all whom he' had enlisted, exactly knew who, or how many had joined the company. And with equal adroitness had he conducted his dealings with every individual, especially in steering clear of representations which could be con- strued into false pretences to get money, relying wholly, after stating all the facts yet come to light, on such hints, and apparently indifferent remarks, as he judged best. calculated to excite curiosity and awaken the avarice of the individual addressed.- In this manner he conducted his bold enterprise, and so diligently and successfully did he pursue his object at the same time, that, by the end of the third week, he had securely enlisted a compa- ny of thirty men in the village and vicinity, of all grades of wealth and character, including, as it afterwards leaked   THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS.      248 out, half the members of the church, and even their good deacon among the number. "Riah -Cutefight is a philosopher," soliloquised Equi- voke, as he retired from a successful application made to the last man he proposed to add to the company-'" yes, he was entirely right -there is indeed a chunk of hu- man nature in every man as big as a wood-chuck, else our cake had -been forever dough." The most difficult and delicate part of his task being now accomplished, nothing more for the present remained for Equivoke to do, but to watch the machinery he had put in motion. And the many silent but significant movements, which, to his gratification, he ascertained were now generally beginning to be made among his re- cruits, such as mortgaging small farms, journeys to dis- tant money lenders, and applications for loans at the near- est bank, all to raise money for unknown purposes, and in specific sums of $100 each, soon sufficiently assured him, that everything was going right, and that, by the end of the month when he was to go round to receive it, the golden harvest would be ready for the reaping. The eventful period was at length fulfilled, and the long looked-for day, which was, to be the last limit of payment, had come and passed away. On the evening of that day, as soon as night had securely drawn her cur- tains, and while Cutefight and Versute were sitting, in the most retired room of the house of. the latter, in evi- dent expectancy of some arrival, the important Equivoke,  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC8035-00000121"/> 244      THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS. fresh from his hard, but now successfully closed labors of collection, suddenly, and with his usual stealthy step, glided into the apartment. "There!" he exclaimed, with- a low exulting chuckle, as glancing knowingly at the others, he unrolled from an old newspaper a large number of assorted and labelled packages of bank bills, and spread them out on the table - "there, sirs! all finished up at last. Just thirty of them in all, a hundred in each; so, exactly a clean, cool thou- sand apiece! Now aint it great?-' all just so - -but run them over for yourselves."  The three now eagerly joined in the count of the pack- ages, found all right, -divided them equally, and pocketed their respective shares, while dancing about the room gleefully snapping their fingers, and otherwise extrava- gantly- evincing the intense gratification they felt at the almost unhoped for success of this their grand financial enterprise. "Well, Eph;" said Cutefight, as their demonstrations subsided, " what do you say now to my philosophy about that chunk of human nature-? You have proved it true by this time, havn't you?" "Yes, it is that, old-- Rasp'em and the Devil aiding which. has enabled me to go through with my difficult part of the scheme so cleverly. But what is now to be the- next move for you and Bill?"  "To be off as we told you, this very night, for some snug prairie farm in the far West. We could probably   THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS.      245 stay here without being hurt, as things have been man- aged; but it might not be exactly pleasant to live among those whom we have taxed so heavily for the lessons of wisdom we shall have given them -not that I should count myself more guilty than they; for the readiness with which they enlisted in our scheme, shows, their will- ingness to go secretly into practices more unlawful than any we ever dreamed of. Yes, we are going. I have no wife; Bill has lost his. We two can well go, and, with a hint from you that we have gone after the treasure, get off safely." "But have you arranged everything?   There is a mortgage or something aint there, where you raised the money we agreed on for starting operations? I never ex-' actly knew how you managed matters when you were gone; -tell me, if you please." "I will -well, after leaving here, we steered directly for a man living about a dozen miles off, whom I knew and who loaned us $8300 on a mortgage of Versute's house here, and a lien n my team. He let us have bills all of one bank over'the mountain:; and with'them over we went," drew out the silver in half dollars, bought a half barrel of flour, opened it, beat down a hole, put in our little bag of money, headed it up tight again and came home.  You know the rest of that. Well, a few days ago we took over the same money, mostly still on hand, you know; to pay up the mortgage man, but was at hand, you know,- to p n,  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC8035-00000122"/> 246      THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS. last lucky enough to sell him the house outright, for near- ly the same sum, which left my team clear, and the mon- ey to be taken by Versute, who has also privately dis- posed of his furniture. So every thing is fixed. The old horse is eating his last mess of Vermont oats, and we shall be far on our journey before morning." "All right for you; but I shall brave it out, for the present, and that being so, all the better for me may be your going, as folks may look on you two as the only re- sponsible ones." "Yes, and to favor that idea the more, for your sake, Bill and I, before we go, will put something on paper and leave it - say under those old newspapers there in the corner, where you can contrive to have it found when the storm bursts, which you must try to stave off as long as you can." "I will; but the first thing for me to do is to go back to the Corners: before folks are abed, to drop the hints necessary to have the right version put on your absence to-morrow morning." "Thank you, Eph. You've done well throughout, and, though not helping any about raising the starting funds, have richly earned the full share you've got- perhaps more; so we will give you that half barrel of flour. still locked up at the tavern; and here is the key." And so the confederates parted; when Equivoke, call- ing on several of his company, told them he had placed all   THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS.      -247 the money raised in the hands of Cutefight and Versute, who were preparing to start with it before light the next morning, and hinted at the great things now, in four or five days, to be expected; while the two latter immediate- ly departed, but in a manner widely different from what their credulous dupes were anticipating. Equivoke was now calculating on a quiet of at least four days; but he was a little mistaken. On the third evening there was much anxious waiting for the arrival of the expected men, and the next morning, when it was fully ascertained they had not arrived, a great deal of disappointment was expressed, and many significant ques- tions began to be raised. And, while many began to be thus agitated by lurking suspicions, an event now occurred that soon fanned those suspicions into an open flame. It was accidentally discovered that Versute had sold out his house and furniture. The news flew like the wind. Ex- cited men came flocking to the tavern from all quarters, and clamored loudly for Equivoke, who, now appearing, seemed as much alarmed as the rest, and proposed an in- stant search of Versute's house, which was accordingly, as soon as it could be reached, ransacked, but in vain, from top to bottom for the money, or something to throw light on the subject. While this was going on, Equivoke found opportunity to secure the promised written missive, and, unseen, placed it, with the key he had taken, on a window sill, where they were soon espied, and snatched up with the exclamations -  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC8035-00000123"/> 248 .      THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS. "A letter! a sealed letter, addressed, ' To whom it concerns.  What can it mean?   Will it do to open it? And then here is a key, too!" "A key?" said Equivoke, coming forward at the. men- tion of the article. "Now I'll bet that is the key of the tavern room, where they kept the half barrel of flour and their money in, it; and that reminds I bought that flour of them some time ago, and was to have it when they took the money away.   But who knows whether the money aint there yet? If 'tis, we'll just have it, and divide it up among ourselves.  Let's all hands go and see, and take the letter along with us." Another rush was now made for the tavern, the mys- ,terious room entered, the half barrel opened, the flour found safe, but the money gone. With low'mutterings of disappointment, the searchers came out to the door, around which nearly the whole of the secret band, though mostly unknown to each other as such, were by this time assembled; when the letter was called for, torn open and read as follows: "' To all-good Deacons, church folks and others, who can honestly say they are without the sin of abetting what they must have known to be, if anything at all was to be made out of it, nothing more or less than a scheme for passing counterfeit money-let them cast the first stone. (Signed)            RIAH CUTFFIGHT. WILLIAM VERSUTE.'" This cool and significant missive was enough for them. Their worst suspicions were all confirmed, and their eyes   THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS.      24: were now fully opened'to the, unwelcome and mortifying truth. But it would have taken a painter adequately to depict the varying expressions of wrath and chagrin that marked their chop-fallen countenances. None now, how- ever, ventured to proclaim themselves particularly in- jured or interested in the denouementt; and all soon sneakingly slipped away to their homes. But as each one - of course knew the part Equivoke had taken, individual communion could be had with him  without exposure; and he was therefore fiercely beset by them all in turn- some begging him to help them, or at least aid in ferret- ing out the runaways, some accusing him of being an ac- complice, and some threatening him outright with suit or criminal prosecution. But Equivoke was very innocent -didn't know as he could blame them for thinking or saying as they did, but he was in fact more to be pitied than any of them; and now it would be as cruel as it would be useless to go to bothering him with suits and prosecutions. And because they believed, as he said, that suits or prosecutions, with any evidence they could com- mand, would be useless, but more especially because they were unwilling to have it known to the public that they had enlisted in a scheme of so questionable a character on the face of it, they did forbear to carry their threats into execution, all except one man, who honestly owned up that he was one of the secret company, swore he would have his money back, and at length brought a suit to re- ll*  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC8035-00000124"/> 250      THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS. cover it. But Equivoke was Equivoke still. Though he had no great fears that the suit would go against him on a trial, yet he would prefer; like the others, to avoid one if, as he believed, he could dodge out of the scrape without it. And with this idea in his scheming brain, he repaired to the court, held in the dining-room of a tavern in another part of the town, promptly answered to his name when the suit was called, but begged a short delay of proceed- ings with a view to a settlement. He then beckoned his opponent ia the suit to a distant corner, and meekly whis- pered to him - "' Now you don't want to make a poor man like me pay any cost?" "Not a cent, if I can only get my money back." "Well, if I could only pay it in some way so 'twouldn't be known what it was for -- ".. "I don't care in what way it is paid, so I get it." "Then suppose you meet me in the bar-room half an hour hence, and I will see what I will do." * The parties accordingly met in the designated room, when Equivoke, seeing several respectable men sitting there who appeared to be observant of all that was passing, pulled out his wallet, counted out before them- one hun- dred dollars, with the bills in hand, approached his oppo- nent, and said to him aloud - "Then you say you want to borrow a hundred dollars of me to-day?" s       - *   THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS.      251 "Why--yes,' replied the other, hesitating, but, under the supposition that these words were only used to dis- guise the matter, finally adding an emphatic "Yes." - "Well, here it is then," said Equivoke, openly hand- ing over the money -" don't want any note - only you stop the suit and give me a receipt of settlement," he add- ed in a whisper. The man did so, and supposed that was the end of the affair. But he was soon made to see his error. Within a fortnight Equivoke sued him for money loaned. The man swore terribly, but soon finding the evidence of the loan, and of his own admission of it as such, so full that he could not help himself, he reluctantly paid back the money, and thus found himself just as much worse off than he was when he began as the costs of both suits amounted to. This 'was the last act of this unique little drama. Equivoke was molested no more. But in a few months he appeared to grow very discontented, and to have become fully convinced that a poor man could do much better in the western country. Accordingly he soon packed up, and with his family openly went off in that direction. And this was the last ever known at Cozy Corners of any of THE RUSTIC FINANCIERS. \      *   &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC8035-00000125"/> THE COUNTERFEITER Fifty years ago no name occupied a larger space in the minds of the masses of the more northerly states of New England than that of Stephen Burroughs, the noto- rious counterfeiter. This famous personage was the son of a worthy minister-of the Gospel who trained him un- der the closest religious discipline, gave him an excellent education and commended him to the public for the high po- sition in life which, it was supposed, his education and great native talent, would enable him easily to achieve. But instead of turning these advantages to any" good ac- count, this perverse son of a good father, soon commenced prostituting his knowledge and talents to the worst of purposes. Now engaging as a teacher and retaining his post a  few months, and till he was deprived of it for the commission of some pitiful trick or other misdoing; and now, having transferred himself to a distant locality, palm- ing himself off as a preacher, and taking advantage of his position to commit moral outrages on the females of his flock; and now again appearing in another place to obtain money on false pretences, or engage' in some scheme of   THE COUNTERFEITER.       253 fraud or outright crime, his career was everywhere marked with deeds of wrong, from -seduction to swindling, and from swindling to theft and forgery. But evading the meshes of the law with wonderful cunning and skill, he defiantly continued his wicked courses for years,' and it was not till he had been several times imprisoned, as many times broken jail, become an outlaw, and so well known as to make him conscious that all his adroitness and inge- nuity would fail to shield him from punishment much longer, that he fled for refuge into Canada, Here breath- ing fierce hate against the people of the States, and -quite as much with a view of doing them great mischief as of making money for himself, he soon got up an establishment for counterfeiting the coin and bank note currency of his native country. And here too, for the next dozen years, he maintained, in wonderful secrecy, a school of counter- feiting, from which, in the persons of his skillfully selected and carefully trained pupils and agents, he kept constant- ly scattered over the northern states, a band of more cun- ning and successful adepts in that line of knavery, than were ever before or since let loose on a suffering public. From among the hundred stories related of the feats of these adepts, in the Protean shape which their villainy was made to assume, we select the following for the enter- tainment of the reader:- In a central part of the, Green Mountains there is a deep valley, nearly a mile long, and secluded from the  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC8035-00000126"/> 254       THE COUNTERFEITER. neighboring settlements by short pieces of woods at either end. The eastern part of this valley is covered by a pond,--a beautiful sheet of mountain waters about a quarter of a mile ,wide, and extending almost the whole length of the valley. Along the western borders of this pond runs a road of considerable travel; while about six- ty rods still further back westward from the pond rises a high, precipitous, ledgy hill, which only falls off at the southern extremity of the valley, where opens a deep, wooded gorge, running up obliquely from the road some distance in the rear of' this long, wall-like eminence. On the road about mid-way of the valley, stands a comfort- able looking farming establishment, the owner's farm be- ing the long strip of land lying between the pond and the hill, which was too steep ajd rocky to produce anything "but briars and a few stunted poplars. The owner of this establishment, whose name was Jo- seph Bidwell, -was a middle aged farmer with a hungry, eager look, and other tokens of the avaricious, selfish dis- position which he possessed, and which, rather than any intelligence and sound calculation, had enabled him to be- come the proprietor of this farm, and another small one, outside the valley, that he had recently sold for a thousand dollars - all cash in hand and now hoarded in the house, awaiting some lucky investment. The other members of the family were the wife, a very common-place, negative sort of a woman,- a son of about twenty, whom they called   THE COUNTERFEITER.       255 Thomas, or rather Tom- an ungainly, long favored youth, bearing the looks and general character of his mother, and lastly, a daughter of eighteen, badly cross-eyed, but quite pretty; while the keen, discriminating glances,. which she was occasionally seen to throw from her straight eye, showed that Kate, for so they called her, was, to use a common cant phrase, nobody's fool. It was a warm summer evening; and farmer Bidwell, the supper having been partaken, had drawn out a chair and taken a seat out-side the door, to enjoy the cool- ness of the evening and ponder over his half-formed schemes for investing his money. Tom, who had that afternoon been down to the store and tavern, situated on the road, some three .miles to the south, came out also, and took a seat on a log near. his father, and taking out his jack-knife began industriously to whittle a stick. "Father," said the son, after a while, "I heard a dum curious story down at the tavern this afternoon." "What was it, Tom?" asked the other with some in- terest. "Why, there was a traveler there from the west side of the mountains, who said a man had lately come among them there to hunt for buried money; and his story was that, in the old French wars, a company of four men had come from Mexico with a large lot of silver dollars; and being on their way to Canada had found themselves about to be waylaid, when about mid-length of lake Champlain,  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC8035-00000127"/> 256       THE COUNTERFEITER. by enemies concealed somewhere in front; when they struck off directly east, in the line of the tallest moun- tain in sight, and on beyond in the line of the tallest" peak in the Eastern range in order to reach Connecticut river. But on the way somewhere between these two mountains, they discovered they were dogged, and so, fixing a trail to ? mislead the pursuers, they buried their money at the foot of a small mountain near a pond."' "1 Now that is a likely story! why did not those men go back and carry off their money if they buried any, which I don't believe." "Because, as the story went, they were pursued into Canada, where they agreed to wait till the dangerous times were over, when they further agreed they would all go together and not go till they all could so go, and get the money. They then scattered, and- they all died or were lost, but one, who waited so long for the others to come that he got too old to go; -so describing the route and place to his son, he sent him for the money; and this son was the man the traveler' said was- now on the hunt for the buried money, but could not find any place that answered the description.' "That first tall monntain that they steered for, when they struck off from the lake, must have been Camel's Hump; but where do you suppose the other was, Tom?" "Well, I've been thinking of that, and made up my mind it was the high peak about fifteen miles easterly of   a -  THE COUNTERFEITER.       zv 4 this; for I and another fellow followed a fox up there last winter, and when we got to the top, we plainly saw that it was the highest in the whole range. Why! we could look down on the whole country round here; and I am quite sure I made out the very mountain that rises here by this pond, and if I did, this and the other two all lie in almost an exact line." "Who was present when the man told the story, Tom?" "O there were several when he began it, but before he began to point out the route the men with the money took, a horse and wagon in the yard broke away and all hands run out but me and the man, who after inquiring where I lived, then went on with the story for me alone, and when the rest got back, the man had gone on his journey, and his story seemed to have been forgotten." "But 'did you then tell them that part they did not hear themselves?" "No, I didn't; for, thinks I, who knows but I may some day take it into my head to look for this buried mon- ey myself, and if so, I should have the advantage of all others." "There you were right," said the father, who had been listening to Tom's account with more interest than his words might seem to imply--" yes, that was right, for if such a story got round here, half the town would be digging over my land, which you know runs back to the foot of the other side of the mountain, and though there  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC8035-00000128"/> 258     , THE COUNTERFEITER. is probably nothing in the story, yet, as I don't want my land dug over, we. will keep the matter to ourselves." It was too late, however, to have that matter kept wholly to themselves. One ear had caught the whole of it; ,and that was the ear of the shrewd and prying Kate. She had accidentally heard Tom announce that he had heard a curious story, and she- stepped behind the door, as it stood ajar, and listened through the crevice thus made, till she heard the whole story, and laid it away in a cor- ner of her mind for future use, if such use should ever come in play. About one week after the little incident just narrated, as Bidwell, the elder, was again sitting before his door cogitating on money matters, and more especially on the story Tom had told him, which had so stirred up his greed of gain that he could not keep his mind from the subject, a foot traveler, approaching along the road from the North, came up and meekly asked if he could obtain lodgings there for the night. Bidwell did not immediately reply,' but fell to scanning the stranger closely. The latter was a youngerly man, respectably dressed, good looking, but seemingly rather bashful, and assumed to be what would be called green in the ways of the world. ' There is a tavern about three miles ahead," suggest- ed Bidwell, after he had closed his scrutiny, making up his mind evidently that the traveler was some simple and moneyless fellow, who was trying to obtain lodgings for little or nothing.   259 THE COUNJ'iffiJI'TR.        25 "Yes, so they told me along back," replied the stranger, "and I supposed I should be able to reach there tonight. But one of my ancles failed me awhile ago--kind 'o sprained I am 'fraid--and I feel as if I couldn't go any further. So I hope you will let me stay. I have money enough, I guess, to pay well for all the trouble I shall make," "Well, I don't know but I must, then,"' remarked Bidwell as the word " money " and " pay " fell on his ear.   "Yes, we will keep you. You have had no supper, I suppose?" "No, sir." A  "Then the women folks will get you up something. Wife -no, she and Tom hav'nt got back from the store yet -- Kate, here is a traveler who is going to stay all night, and he would like some supper." "I can get him some," responded the girl coming to the door, "I can get him some, if I can know what he would like, and we have it." "O, bread and milk, cold victuals or anything you have, handy," said the traveller. Kate now disappeared; but in a short time came to the door again, and said that the gentleman's meal was ready. -The stranger now took his seat at the table, and Kate. seating herself at a distance on the opposite side and suffi- . ciently in front of him to give her a fair view of his face, *^  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC8035-00000129"/> 260       THE COUNTER'"l'IT9R. continued to eye him closely - so closely indeed that he seemed to-become conscious that he was the object of her scrutiny, and he several times lifted his eyes to her face, but owing to her cross eyes, he mistook the direction of her glances, every time he looked up, and finished his meal without any further marks of uneasiness. 'i The wife and her son Tom, having arrived, in the mean- time,' now came in and took their turn in looking at the stranger, and glancing from him to Bidwell, seemed tacit-  ly to be asking, who the former was, and what was his name and business? and the latter taking the hint, began in a round about way to question the other on these points. In answer to the implied or direct questions of the farmer, the stranger said his name was John Gale - wa'n't ashamed to own that anywhere, - that he lived a day's journey or more to the north-west, and that he had come into this section to see how he liked the looks of the farming lands, being desirous of buying a small farm, if he could do so "part pay on trust, and part down pay," to which his fa- ther, he added, had promised to help him, soon in case he succeeded in suiting himself in a purchase. This mainly closed the conversation-for the evening. But just as the family were on the point of retiring, Bidwell turned partly to his son, and asked with a knowing wink, '"Say, Tom  did'nt learn anything more of what we were talking about, did you, down there, this afternoon?" "No, not a word," replied Tom with an equally know- ing look.   THE COUNTERFiTlK.        261 The stranger, Gale, slightly started at this question of the father, and sent a keen, searching glance at the face of the farmer and then to that of the son as the question was being asked and answered, and then instantly reas- sumed his former simple, half stolid look. But this, as slily as it was done, was not managed slily enough to es- cape one watchful eye; and that again was the sharp eye of the vigilant Kate. She had detected in Gale, the sud- den start and change that came over his countenance at her father's question, which she was at no loss to under- stand herself, had noted his keen and eager look of in- quiry, and his sudden relapse into indifference; and it all set her to thinking and speculating. The next morning Gale rose lamer than ever, and as- serting that it was impossible for him to travel, sought and obtained leave to remain where he was a few days, or until his ancle was better. He spent most of his time in hobbling round with a stout cane after Bidwell, who was at work near the house, inquiring the localities and prices of lands in that section, asking the advice of the latter about purchasing, and then striking off in a sociable strain on other subjects, and in all showing the most flattering deference to the other's opinions; so that by night the two had apparently become the best of friends. ' Tom, what do you think of this Mr. Gale?" asked Kate as the two sat near each other milking the yarded cows that evening.  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC8035-00000130"/> 262       THE COUNTERFEITER. "Why, he is a right down clever fellow, I think, don't you, Kate?" "No. I don't." "Why now what's the reason? ' "No matter, I don't like him." "Why?  "Because I don't.' "O well, it is gal's natur, I s'pose. You have got hitched to one fellow that fills your eye, and can't see nothing that is quite right and agreeable in any other. That is the reason of it, I guess, Kate." "Now I say it is no such thing, Tom. But I am not obliged to tell you all, my thoughts, nor whys and where- I - fores.' So we'll let it drop." Tom had not hit the mark exactly; but he might have shot more widely from the truth than he did. Kate's con- duct and feelings were indeed influenced by the circum- stance to which he had alluded, but not in the manner he had hinted. She was engaged to be married to a young man in the vicinity; and the young couple were anxious to marry the ensuing winter. But the young man's means were very limited. He had a small farm and house, which he had barely paidi for, but had not a dollar left to stock it and commence operations; so it became evi- dent that the marriage must be postponed another year, unless Kate's father would give her a portion suflicient to help them out of the difficulty, and she had appealed   TEE COUNTERFEITER.       263 earnestly to him to furnish the required aid. But he then refused her on the ground that he had no ready mon- ey, and had no means of getting any. He however soon unexpectedly found a cash sale for his other farm, as he called it, which deprived him of his old excuse for not helping her. And she appealed to him again with re- doubled earnestness and determination. But here, again, he put her off with evasive answers; while all the time he, selfish and hypocritical even towards his own family, was secretly casting about him for an opportunity of in- vesting all his money, so as to put it out of his power to comply with her wishes. This she shrewdly suspected; and she resolved she would thwart his purposes, and try some means or other, so to manage as to compel him to do her what she believed to be an act of simple justice; for should he give her the whole thousand dollars, instead of the half which she asked for, even then, the bulk of the property would be left for the eventual inheritance of her brother Tom. '             * With such thoughts and feelings prevailing in her mind, it was no wonder that she keenly watched all, who, what- ever their pretences, approached her father, as we have seen her in the case of the newly -arrived stranger. She had disliked his appearance from the first, thinking she saw in him a sort of affected humility, and a simplicity of demeanor, which she inferred must be assumed to cover some secret design; and the sensation and look she de- ,  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC8035-00000131"/> 264       THE COUNTERFEiTER. tected in him when her father questioned Tom about a matter which they had reason to believe was only known between themselves, more than confirmed her suspicions. It was the third morning after the arrival of Gale, that the latter went into the yard, and, taking a seat on a log near where Bidwell was at work repairing a farming tool, sat some minutes in an apparent study, and without speaking a word. "Say, Mr. Bidwell," at length said Gale addressing the other with a tone of confident familiarity, which im- -plied that the two had by this time become intimate friends "Say, Mr. Bidwell, what is your belief about dreams?" "Well," returned the other indifferently, " being never much troubled with them, I never bothered my head'with them any way -about their ever being fulfilled, I sup- pose you mean?" "Yes, I do." "Then I can't say exactly what I do believe. I have heard tell of cases where they strangely came out true just as they were dreamed. But where there is one case where they come out so, and mean something, no doubt there are ten thousand that come out false, and have no meaning at all. Don't you think so, Gale?" "Yes,- I have not the least faith in dreams." "Nor can I say I hate generally. But what made you ask my opinion about the matter?"   THE COUNTERFEITER.       265 "Because, I had a very curious dream myself last night, which seemed so clear arid real, and left such a strong impression -on my mind after I was awake, that I could'nt help recalling it, and had just been doing so, when I asked you the question." "Why, what was it, Gale?  What kind of a dream could it be, which left such an impression on your mind?" "Well, I don't know about repeating the absurd thing. I thought at first, I would not, for fear of being laughed at."  "O, no danger of that, so out with it, Gale. I begin now to feel kind of curious to hear it." "Well, as the matter has gone so far between us per- haps I may as well tell it to you- that is, if you will not laugh at me yourself, nor tell it to your women folks and Tom, so they can run a rig on me, as they would be likely to do, if they knew it." "Go on." "I will. The dream was this -I remember it all dis- tinctly. I thought I was walking along down a road, that seemed some like this -water on one side and hills on the other, though I don't remember so particularly about ,the road and appearances round it, as I do about the ap- pearance of things I soon after met with. Well, after walking along the road awhile, I thought I came to a piece of woods, where a woody valley opened on the right.  where something induced me to turn off from the road and 12 , Of  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC8035-00000132"/> 266       THE. COUNTr'itl'RBTK. go up the valley, or gorge it appeared to be, winding out from behind the high hills I had been passing when coming down the road. 'As I passed up this valley, I took notice of all the objects I encountered on the way, and re- member how the hills looked, here shutting down close to my path, and there setting-some ways back how the trees looked, and everything looked on the way. And seeming to feel that some great good fortune awaited me ahead, I continued to press forward till I came to a rather dark looking spot, when that same something - what it was, or whether it was a- spirit or not, I did'nt know,- that same something -that had moved me to come there, made me to understand I was to dig down near the roots of a large, old, bulging tree. - I did so, and soon came to a thin fiat rock, which I soon succeeded in raising up on one edge; when, in--.a small, stoned-up inclosure beneath, I beheld to my great surprise and delight, a large lot,- nearly -a peck it seemed to me,- of silver dollars! The unexpected sight made me, I thought, almost crazy Fwith joy. I leaped up to hurra over -my good fortune, and in the Seeming effort, I suddenly awoke." "There, Mr. Bidwell, you have all the substance of my dream. Now was it not a curious one?   - "Well-yes-perhaps so," replied Bidwell, who hbad been listening to what he had heard with the most eager interest, which now, however, he seemed trying to con- ceal; - " yes, curious enough," he continued, with an as- ,   ,    THE COUNTERFEITER.       267 sumed air of jolly indifference. "It is a pity it wa'n't true. But should you know the place if you could see it?" "' To be sure I should - that is if there was really and such place, and I could see it," said Gale carelessly. "But you don't believe in dreams, I think you said?" rejoined the other. "No; - they ar'n't any of them worth minding. But the puzzle with me is to think what could have put such a regularly built up piece of nonsense into my head." "Well, it was strange, seeing there was no cause for it." And Bidwell resumed his work with great industry, and kept silent some time; when, suddenly starting up, he said "There now! I had entirely forgot I promised to meet my neighbor next north here, about this hour, to agree where to place a division line fence we are contem- plating; so I must be off, leaving your company for the women, or, if you prefer, to go a fishing with Tom, who is fixing to go out on the pond, I see. Now let me see, what tools shall I want? He will have an axe, and as we may have to dig a few post holes, I will take a spade." So saying Bidwell took the tool he had named, and hur- ried awy in the indicated direction, leaving Gale, who seemed to read the motives that were actuating him, glancing after him with a sly look of scorn and triumph. On reaching the woods, at the north end of the valley, he, instead of going forward on his pretended business, ,  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC8035-00000133"/> 268 ,      THE COJUNTERkE'ITiR. tuited short to the left into the woods, and rapidly mount- edi the hill, here only of moderate ascent. W-hen he had reached the summit, and paused a few minutes to take breath, He turned short to the left and again struck off in a southerly direction along the westerly slope of the here heavily wooded mountain -towards the head of the valley, which we hlave before described, and which he had at once unhesitatingly decided to be the locality of Gale's dream. liUd he not only felt confident of this; but, coupling that dream with the story Tom had heard about the former burying of money in the rear of a small mountain, of -hich this so well answered the description; he as confi- dently believed in the dream itself, having, in his avari- cious blindness, no doubt but it truly indicated the exact spot where that old treasure lay concealed. All this had flashed through his mind almost as soon as Gale had fin- ilshed relating his dream, but he carefully kept his thoughts to himself; and he felt thankful that Gale had hnot the same reason to believe in the dream as he had, for had the dreamer known anything about the old treasure, he would either have never told the dream and gone and got' ali the :treasure; or, if he had told it, and they had gone together and found it, he would have claimed at least half for himself. "But now," thought the mean and blinded schemer, "I will have it all to myself, and let the simpleton continue to flout his dream, as he appears to do now; and the more he flouts it the better."   "THE COUNTERFIl'TlSR.     269 And chuckling to himself over these thoughts, and thrown completely. off his guard against any deceptive scheme in anybody else- Bidwell confidently descended into the valley and eagerly pressed forward till he thought he must have reached the locality which Gale had des- cribed as the spot of the buried money., But he soon founddthat the description he had received was altogether too indefinite to prove any regular guide to his search. There were a great many dark and shaded spots, and a great many rough looking old trees, but which was the right spot, and which was the right tree where he should dig for the money,bhe felt utterly unable to determine. Indeed, after wandering about awhile, he could feel no as- surance that he could hit within, half of a mile of the spot he would find. But though greatly discouraged, he yet determined be would not leave the place without mak- ing some effort, and so, for the next hour or two, he went round thrusting his spade down near every old tree in the vicinity of the different shaded places; but always striking into strong roots or gravelly hard pan which: he knew could never .have been dug up for burying anything, he reluc- tantly gave up the chase and bent his steps homeward, muttering to himself as he went, "It's no use hunting any more.  I must take him along with me to find the place, if I do have- to go halves with him. Yes, it must be done, and we will be at it to-morrow morning," Wishing for a little more time to think over his-newly  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC8035-00000134"/> 270       THE COUNTERFli'l'T i. O formed purposes and decide on the best manner of carry- ing them into execution, he did not broach the subject to Gale that night; but the next morning following him out into the yard, he soon introduced it by carelessly saying, g I have been thinking over what you told me yester- day morning, Gale, and-"  "Told you about what, Mr. Bidwell?' "About your singular dream." "My dream! Why, it had entirely passed out of my mind. But what about it?" "Well, though I did not at first attach much conso- quence to it, yet in thinking it over in my absence yester- day afternoon, and after I went to bed, I began to feel as though it must mean something."      '  "You did?  Well, that goes beyond me. But are you really beginning to have faith in dreams?" - "No, not in them generally; but you was so clear and *rational, that it has -struck me it might be one of those which they say people sometimes have to put them on the track of something important for them to know.- And I have been thinking I would propose to you to go with me, to-day, and see what discoveries we can make in the mat- ter." "Go where? Do    you know of any such place as I saw in the dream?"?" "On reflection last night I felt confident I did " "Where?' }   ,      * *   THE COUNTERFEITER.       27 1 "Nearer than you would suspect. I will lead you to it if you will go with me, this forenoon. What say you, Gale? ' "Why, it will be nothing but a wild goose chase. Be- sides, as my ancle is now nearly well; I was thinking of starting on my journey to-day." "O O don't be in a hurry about that. You can at least stay another day." "Yes, I suppose I might. I am willing to do almost anything to oblige you, Mr. Bidwell; and if you really wish it, I will go with you--that is, if we can go and come without its being known to your folks; for I can't' bear being laughed at." ' I will manage that, Gale: for whether our jaunt amounts to anything or not, I am as anxious to have it kept dark as you are. So I'll fix matters, and will be off at once." With this Bidwell went into the house, gave Tom his task in hoeing for the day, and told his wife and Kate that he was going a few miles down towards the store and tavern, with Mr. Gale, to look at some land he had been recommending him to purchase. He then came out, slily put a spade under the long smock-frock he wore, joined his companion, and the two leisurely took their way down the road. When they reached the woods, Bid- well soon came to a halt, and pointing up the valley, opening, as we have before said, near this place, looked sharply to the other and said-  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC8035-00000135"/> ,272      THE COUNTERr l'ra. "There, Gale!  Do you remember ever seeing that place before?  Gale hesitated some time, then began to look bewildered, then surprised, and finally replied "It does seem as if -I had seen such a place as the one you have pointed out. But how could I? I have never been here before in my life." "Except in your dream, Gale. "My dream!  O yes,--yes,-- Well, now, who knows what- this business is coming to, after all? But let us push on up the valley, I can soon tell whether this is go- ing to prove the place I saw in my dream." They now hurried forward up the gently ascending slope of the wooded valley, Gale every few rods pausing to point out objects he professed to recognize as .those seen in his dream, and growing continually more confi- dent and animated as he went. When they reached that part of the valley which Bidwell had vainly explored the day before, the latter slackened his pace, and peering back- ward and forward, asked- "Is not the place somewhere round here?" 9"No, no," promptly replied Gale--"further up- further up the valley. But we will soon be there now- so courage and forward, is the word." Bidwell's countenance, which, from the -remembrance of his own vain search yesterday, had thus far worn a doubtful expression, now visibly brightened, and he fol- *   THE COUNTERJ'l: 1'rt.     273 lowed in silence, and thus they proceeded on until they came near the head of the valley. which, at this point, spread out to nearly .double its previous width - a place that Bidwell had, the day before passed on one side and, without pausing to examine, feeling sure from the des- cription which Gale had artfully given, that the spot in quest must be at least a quarter of a mile below.  There!" said Gale, pausing and turning towards the southerly side of the valley, " this must be very near the spot,- yes, it is,- it certainly is, Mr. Bidwell. You see that thick clump of trees about ten rods in front of me? Well, they stand near the place, and now for the old bulged tree - O, there it is, a few rods beyond! We have it - we have it, Mr. Bidwell, as sure as a gun--come on, sir come on! ' So saying he bounded forward, shouting, to the desig- nated spot where Bidwell, the next moment coming up, found him standing near the roots of the tree in question, gleefully snapping the fingers of one hand above his head:, and with the other significantly pointing downward "About thlere, " he said, in a low exulting tone as he low- ered his pointing finger neajly to the ground, "about down there,- a little more th: a foot below the surface." Bidwell needed no further incitement to action; but grasping his spade and hurriedly -scraping away the old leaves and rotten twigs over the space of a yard square, he A commenced, with trembling eagerness, throwing out the 12*  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC8035-00000136"/> 274       THE COUNTERFEITER. earth from the circuit, which Gale, standing by, marked out with his cane. After excavating this space evenly to the depth of nearly a foot, he struck down his spade in the centre, but some unseen obstruction prevented it from entering but a few inches. "There is nothing but stones down there," he said with an air of disappointment. "Why, aint it the rock? said Gale "the thin flat rock, which, as I told you, I found in my dream, laid over the money? Don't be discourage^:%bit strike down again stiffly, and see if it don't jar and give out a hollow sound?' It was done; and the jar, indicating a thin, loose rock, and the hollow sound, indicating the cavity. under it, in- stantly followed the blow. "There, I told you so! exclaimed Gale exultingly. a Now clean off the dirt from that rock, clear to the edges; so that we can raise it.'  This was speedily accomplished also; and the two men quickly reached down, and seizing one side of the rock, brought it with a sudden effort, to an upright position; when eagerly peering over it, they beheld, with greedy and wildly flashing eye sthe identical pile of dollars, which Gale had describedi having found in his dream. "O, by the living Job!" exclaimed Gale in a seeming ecstacy of delight. L Now who would have expected this? Why, my share,--for we shall go shares of course,-'will be enough to buy me a farm and pay all down for it on the   THE COUNTERFEITER.       275 spot! My fortune is made for life! Whoo-rah!--huz- zah!" "Hush! hush! your noise may attract somebody to the spot," said Bidwell, while he and Gale simultaneously reached down, and each clutched up a handful of the dol- lars. "Why, how rusty they all are- what makes them so rusty?" said Gale. "Reason enough for that,-they have been buried here more than fifty years,-that is, if-" and, Bidwell here checked himself; for believing he only was master of the secret of the Spanish party burying treasure in this vicinity, as he made it out; and believing, also, that there must be more of it concealed somewhere near, he meant to secure all -these advantages to himself. "These are Spanish coins, and of an old date, too," re- marked Gale, scrutinizing one of the dollars, without ap- pearing to hear what the other had been saying. "Yes,-I expected that too; for-" and Bidwell again checked himself. "Well, Mr. Bidwell," now remarked Gale, still appa" rently oblivious of what the other had said, "Well, sir, what is to be done with this ihbe first place?" "Why, take it out and fill up the hole as we found it," replied the other. Then, as I have strings in my pocket, I will take off my frock, make it to serve as a bag, and put the money into it, so that it can be carried off with- o      ..  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC8035-00000137"/> 276       THE COUNTERFEITER. out being seen, for I want this windfall of ours to be kept secret, for the present." "Yes, but where do you propose to carry the money, then. You will let your family know it of course, if \you carry the money home." "But I don't propose to carry it home. I know of a safe place where we can deposit it without being seen by any of my folks at the house, whom I have my reasons for keeping in entire ignorance about our good fortune." -A short time sufficed to transfer the newly found treas- ure to the frock, fashioned into a bag for the purpose as before proposed, fill -up the hole and make- everything ready for leaving the place. Bidwell then raised the treasure burden, and, balancing it on his Shoulder, like a bag of grain on the back of a horse, led the way down the valley, followed by Gale; with a sly, exultant look, which told how well he was satisfied with the manner in which everything was working for the furtherance of his schemes. After passing out of the valley, they struck into, the road, and, with quickened steps, proceeded along up it homewards, about a quarter of a mile, or about half way between the- woods and the house; when, reaching a long narrow swell which hier shot out from the hill trans- versely across the road, of, elevation sufficient to cut off all view of 'the house from  those approaching it from  the south, Bidwell, significantly pointing towards the hill, struck off into the field on his left, and proceeded stealthi-   THE COUNTERVElTEKt.       27T7 ly along under the southern lee of the swell to a low cop- pice, standing near the point where the swell was merged in the steep sides of the long mountain barrier, walling in the valley as already described.  "There, Gale, is the place for our money, for the pres- ent," said -Bidwell, stepping behind some tall bushes that screened him from the road, and pointing to what appeared to be an excavation into the side of the hill, which. had been pieced out in front by embanking, with the en- trance closed bJy a rude plank door. "It is a-sort of hill- side cellar-hole, which I built for storing my surplus po- tatoes. It is clean and empty, except the straw left there; and as it is hidden from the road and -field by the bushes, our money might lie there six months before any body would find it; so let us go in and conceal it." They then, after throwing open the door, peering in, and finding everything as expected, entered, cleaned off a small spot in a corner, poured down their dollars and care- fully covered them with straw. "It is now about noon, I suppose," said Bidwell put- ting on his frock; "so let us now go h-ome to dinner; and in the afternoon we will come back here, and count and divide the money." They then, after ascertaining that no one was passing in the road, went along leisurly homeward, congratulating themselves, not only on their wondrous haul of money, but that nobody could- have suspected it, and no eye could -              &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC8035-00000138"/> 278     -  THE COUNTERFEITER. have seen them in bringing out of the woods and conceal- ing their treasure. But in this they counted without their host. One mind had suspected the business in which they had been engaged that forenoon, and one eye had seen them ap- proach from the woods; cross over into the field, bearing something heavy, concealed in her father's frock, as she judged by his being in his shirt sleeves; enter the old po- tato cellar, and then come out without their load. And that mind and eye were once more those of the keen. witted, and keenly interested, Kate Bidwell. She had no- ticed her father's departure the previous afternoon, and, after learning his pretended business to their next neigh- bor about a division line, which she knew was'a false ex- , cuse as that neighbor had been several days absent from home, she at once suspected he was gone on a money dig- ing excursion on the other side the mountain; though, not knowing the extent of his meanness and duplicity, she could not conceive why he did not take Gale along with him. She had seen them both depart that morning, after detecting her father stealthily putting his spade under his frock, and, notwithstanding their pretence of land-look- ing, she felt very confident they had gone by- another route to the other side of the mountain with the same ob- ject. And having, in search of berries, before that time, discovered an easy, way of passing obliquely up the al- most perpendicular ledge against the house, to a certain   THE COUNl'Je'tRl'lTfia.     279 cliff, which was nearly a hundred feet above it, and whichl commanded a clear view of the road south and everything between it and the hill as far as the woods including the mouth of the gorge, she, after they had- left, by way of testing her suspicions, ran to the hill and clambered up to her lofty look-out, from which she watched the objects of her suspicion till they reached the woods, and then saw them leave the road and turn up the valley. Being thus confirmed, as it drew towards noon, when they might be expected to be making their appearance on their return bhome, she went up the ledge again to see if she could make any more discoveries, ant it was then, that she saw them approaching with a burden, enter the old cellar, and soon come forth without it. All thislshe had seen, drawn her own inferences, and got down unobserved into the house before they reached it for their dinner. During the repast that now followed, the men did not seem inclined to talk much, but Kate easily detected an expression of unusual satisfaction in the' countenance of her father, and one of sly triumph in that of Gale. After dinner the two men, this time forgetting in their eagerness to be fingering their treasure, to invent any new excuse for a renewed absence, again took their way down the road. Kate, to fortify her conclusions deemed it expedient again to watch them; and such was the ce- lerity of her movements, that they had barely passed out sight of the house before she was at her old perch on- the  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC8035-00000139"/> 280       THE COUNTERI'Sl'ER. -cliff, where, as she expected, she saw them turn into the field beyond the swell, approach and enter the old cellar; when she musingly returned to the house. We wi-ll now return to the treasure finders, who were, by this time, intently engaged in counting and laying out in separate piles their rusty dollars. t "' There!'? said Gale, whose fingers had- moved more nimbly than those ofhis companion. "I have counted out into my pile just one clean thousand dollars--how many have you got?- O, you aint through yet-- I'll help you out," he added, suiting the action to the word, and assisting till the remainder of the pile was disposed of. - "And mine, too, now," returned Bidwell as he took up the last dollar, '" mine, too, amounts to the same sum, and two or three dollars, I think, to spare." "All right then -I thought there must be somewhere in the neighborhood of two thousand dollars in the whole -   a fine sum for each of us. But what do you propose to do with your share, Bidwell? t' "Keep it, Gale--keep it for the present, and every- thing connected with it, a profound secret. What are you going to do with yours?" "Lay it out for a farm-- that is, I should, if I had it where I happened to make the purchase. But I have been thinking how I should get it away. With my still weak ancle, it will be as much as I can do to carry my pack as it was; and if I put in this- heavy load, I could   THE COUNTERKITAlR.       281 not get five miles with it without breaking down.- What shall I do?- Can't I get-this specie changed into good bank notes down there at the store, do you suppose?" "Well, I should doubt whether they would. have bank bills enough on hand to exchange for all your silver - and if they-should, I hope you will not think-of making such an exchange there," responded Bidwell deprecatingly. - I should like to know why not?" said Gale, with af- fected surprise. "Because they will soon find out where you got the money; and then it will set the whole country around agog in a useless search for buried treasures, and especial- ly on my land, to its injury; and I wont have it." "Yes, but what am I to do? 7. - "Well, I will tell you what can be done. I have a thousand dollars now in my house in bank money, which I took for an extra farm I lately sold," said Bidwell, afters- some hesitation. "You have?" exclaimed Gale, feigning surprise on be- ing told what he well knew from the first. "Yes, and I don't know but I had better let you have it for your share of the silver. I have some family rea- sons for putting all my money into specie; for then I can say I have invested it, which will put an end to the trou- blesome teasings I should otherwise have to endure from a certain quarter." "But are you sure all your bank bills are good, correct money?"             .  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC8035-00000140"/> 282       THE COUNTERFEITER; "Every one of them." ' It is a bargain, then - at least on my part." "Well, I guess I will say on my part also; and you shall have your money to-night, or before you wish to start in the morning." Kate, in the meanwhile, having contented herself with household duties several hours after seeing her father and Gale enter the old cellar the last time, thought she would go up once more to her look-out, thinking that, by this time they would soon be coming out, and that, in so doing,she might, perhaps, make some additional discover- ies. But lest she should be detained in accomplishing her object, she, took the precaution of carrying a small basket, and telling her mother she perhaps might find some raspberries for supper. Thus prepared, she once more ascended to the cliff, and seating herself under a screening bush, and keeping her eyes on the old cellar, patiently awaited the result. Within a half hour, her patience was rewarded. She saw her father and Gale is-- sue from their concealment, move along -under the swell stealthily as before, till they got over into the road, and then, assuming their usual gate, leisurely proceed home- ward. It was evident to her that they had brought out nothing with them from'the cellar. And whatever was the object there which had been engaging their attention so long, it must still remain there. What could it be, which should require such secrecy and care for conceal-   THE COUNTERFEITER.       283 ment?   What else could it be but money of some kind? It was not her father's paper money she was convinced; for she knew where he kept it. She bad seen him, when he first brought it home in a compact thick package, de- posit and lock it up in a small trunk before containing only a few light, loose papers. By lifting and raising one end of this trunk, her ear would plainly detect the pres- ence of .this package by its tumbling about within. She had almost daily given the trunk this inspection', especial- ly every time, and soon after, her father had loft home under whatever pretense he might have gone; and that afternoon, after he and Gale left, she had been to the trunk, and, in the way we have just named, had fully as- certained -that the package was still lying safely and un- touched within. The money in the old cellar then must be, as she had before concluded, hard money. But was it good or was it bad money? She could not believe it, to be good; and if not, what else could it be but counter- feit hard dollars? Were this so, what would she not give to know it? It would furnish her such power over her father to compel him to grant her request; and especially ly it would afford such certain means of punishing Gale for attempting, as she still feared he would do in some way, to defraud her father out of his good money, or if not, to entrap him into crime. And why could she not know it? And as she reached this point in the current of thought that had been thus rapidly flashing over her busy brain, she suddenly formed a bold resolution.  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC8035-00000141"/> 284     - THE , COUNTERFEITER. All along the foot of this steep, ledgy hill, ran a nar- row belt of thick copsewood, extending from a point some distance north of the house all the way to the old cellar, and in pursuance of the resolution just formed, the sly and determined girl quickly descended from her look-out, without coming out so as to be seen from the house or the road, turned to the south, and, carefully keeping within ,the bushes, she ran, or rather flew, like a retreating bird on half wing, rapidly threading her way-among the ob- structing. trees and brush, until she reached the place for which -she had started. iHere pausing a moment to peer out towards the road, she hurried down into the old cellar, and commenced turning over the straw on the floor in full confidence of soon finding what she sought, and she was not to be disappointed. In a few minutes while removing a pile of carefully laid straw she suddenly came upon the very pile of dollars of which she was in search. Without pausing longer than to note the general appearance of the dollars, she caught up two of them, taken at random from different parts of the pile, and transferred them to her pocket; when, carefully replacing the straw, she hur- ried out, and regaining the copse, made her way back home- ward as fast as she came. -But, by way of precaution, she kept within the bushes some little distance north of the house, when she emerged into the field, and leisurely approaching, entered the room, where her father and Gale were unsuspectingly sitting, with the careless remark, as she put away her basket, that " the berries were all gone."   THE :COUNTERFEITER.       285 That night after Kate had retired to her sleeping apartment, she took: out one of the suspected dollars, ex- amined its rusted and -discolored sides closely, and passed her tonfgue several times over it with the view of wetting it and then trying to rub off the rust and stains; when she thought the coin imparted a remarkably saltish taste. But not succeeding to her 'mind by rubbing it, she had recourse to some soap and water she had in the room, which she soon saw was having the desired effect, and by dint of further washing and scouring, she, after a while, reduced it to a clean, palely bright dollar, the hue of which at once reminded her of a counterfeit coin, that on some pre- vious occasion, she had seen tested. Here she paused a moment to account for the saltish taste the coin had so strongly left on her tongue; when the truth quickly flashed over her mind - that whole pile of dollars had been artificially rusted with salt and water for the pur- pose of deception. But there were other tests that, it now occurred to her, could be applied, and she fell to par- ing and scraping one edge of the coin with the sharp blades of her scissors, which process soon cut away what was evidently a thin, specious -looking plating, and dis- closed another kind of metal which she knew was anything but pure silver. This with her, fully settled the ques- tion, and she went to bed, exulting in the power she now held, when the occasion should arrive for her to use it, which she did not then suppose would very immediately  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC8035-00000142"/> 286       THE COUNTA'fRFEITER. occur, as she expected Gale would remain with them at least several days longer. But that occasion was to ar- rive much sooner than she supposed. The next morning, immediately after breakfast, Bid- well and Gale went out, and after some sauntering move- ments about the yard, intended to put those off their guard who might be -watching them, they entered the barn and remained together there nearly an hour. This was no- ticed by the observant Kate with considerable uneasiness, which was at length greatly increased by their long con- tinued delay in making their appearance, and she was be- ginning to contrive some way by which, unseen, she could reach a position behind the barn, where she could peep through a crevice and see what they were about; when her cogitations were cut short by their, at that moment, unexpected entrance into the house, and their no less un- expected announcement that Gale was about to take his leave of them, and to resume his journey. Kate was not prepared for this announcement, and It considerably non- plused her; for she had not made up her mind in what manner she woold exercise her newly obtained power over her father and Gale; and she had, till this moment, sup- posed the latter would remain long enough to enable her to come to a decision. What should she do? Boldly de- clare her discoveries to them, and tell her father that his supposed treasure was but a worthless mass of counterfeit dollars? No; for he, under the sanguine belief in bu-   THE COUNTERFEITER.        7 ied treasures in this vicinity, formed from the story Tom bad heard, coupled with the representations Gale must have made, or the artifices he must have practised, had be- come so infatuated and bat-blind, that he could not for some days be brought to believe the truth; and before he would be convinced, the man by whom he had been duped, taking warning in season, would doubtless flee from that part of the country -- No, that would never do. And so, like many others whose first impulses have been checked by suddenly occurring doubts, she did nothing. In a short time, Gale completed the few preparations he had to make for his journey; when he strapped on his pack, bid the family good bye, and departed down the road to the south; while Bidwell, after despatching Tom to do some suddenly remembered job south of the swell, so that his presence would prevent Gale from returning to carry off any of the treasure, if. disposed to do so - Bidwell saddled his horse, and informing his family of his destina- tion, rode off to attend to some neglected business in--the north part of the town. Soon after Bidwell left, Kate began to regain her scat- tered wits; when all at once, she gave a wild start, and exclaimed to herself, ' Stupid! after knowing they were so long in the barn together in such a secret manner, stupid! stupid! that I had not thought to go and see to this before." And with this. she, with a startled look, ran to the  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC8035-00000143"/> 288       THE COUNTERFEITER. money trunk, hastily canted it this way and that; but no. sound or movement such as had rewarded all her previous tests of the kind, were perceptible from within. O mad- ness! the package of money was gone-!and how gone, and to whom, she was now. no longer at a loss to under- stand. For a moment she stood mute- with consterna- tion. But she soon aroused herself for action; for she clearly saw that if this great swindle, which must prove so great a calamity to her father, and, indirectly, a worse one to herself, was not to be tamely, submitted to, some- thing must be done, and that promptly. But what should that somethinghe? To follow her father,--even if he could be overtaken in time to avail anything,-declare to him the fraud and try to induce him to return to pur- sue the -perpetrator and compel restitution, at least, would be open to some of the same objections which had pre- vented her from declaring to him her discoveries in Gale's presence; and besides, she felt very reluctant to let him -know, as she must, that she had so often been to his money trunk, or to the old cellar,-in the manner which she had, and with motives that had actuated her; or, in short, that she had been such a spy on his actions. This brought her to the other and only alternative, which was to follow Gale. But who should do it? -Tom.? No, he would accom- plish nothing. Her lover, John Perley? ,He -would manage the business rightly, no doubt, but he lived miles away over the other side of te -pond, and before he could   THE COUNTERFEITER.       289 be put fairly on the 'track the villain would be beyond Wach. No, she must go herself; and in full confidence in her courage, and in her sagacity to conduct the affair as well, and, in the danger that her father, whom she would shield, would be implicated, even better than any one else. She firmly resolved she would go, and be immediately on the way. And no sooner had she formed her bold resolu- tion than she went to her mother, whom she did not wish, to make a confidant in the case, and, on pretence of se- curing a calico apron from a piece, which she was afraid would be gone, if she delayed going for it-longer, made known her intention of walking that day down to the store. Meeting here with no serious objection, she hurried to her room, quickly changed her dress, and, within five minutes, was rapidly making her way down the road on her adven- turous purpose. After walking between two and three! miles, at a pace which few ordinary pedestrians would have equalled, she arrived at a small house, situated close by the-- road side,. about a half mile from the little village, or small collection of buildings scattered round the store and tavern. This house being occupied by a seamstress who, in summer was always found at her work- at an open window, Kate,- mindful of this fact and feeling somewhat acquainted with the oecupant, concluded to call, and, while resting herself a little, ascertain how long it had been since Gale had -passed by the house. But in reply 18  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC8035-00000144"/> 290       THE COUNTERFEITER. toher question respecting the passing of a traveler whom she described, the woman assured her that no such travel- er, nor any other foot traveler had passed by her house that forenoon. This information disappointed, and great- ly perplexed the heroic girl. What could have become of Gale? she mentally queried. He had not come this way, it was clear; and there was no road that turned off from her father's to this place. He must have then turned somewhat aside into the woods, But where? Knowing the character of the comparatively short reach of forest on the road, she could think of no place where he would be likely to do this but up the valley, which had been the scene of the money digging. And had he not some se- cret retreat back there in the widely extended forest which she knew stretched back from the mountain westward- a retreat which had been kept, in his absence, by some such confederate as she had always suspected he had somewhere in the vicinity? It must be so; and she now recollected hearing her brother Tom, who had ranged all the surrounding forests in fox-hunting, mention a solitary log-house, standing, with a small patch of clearing around it, in the midst of the woods; it having been erected a few years before by a man who designed to settle there, but for some reason soon relinquished his purpose, leaving the place to be overrun with bushes and briers. Ah! that was it -that must be -the place, she thought, and though she could not think of following up the villain into the *    THE COUNTERFEITER.       291 woods herself, she yet- instantly formed the design of causing it to be done by other and more efficient agencies. The sheriff of the county resided at this little village. Kate had seen him at her father's house, where he had once called to summon her father as a witness, and stopped to dine; so that she felt somewhat acquainted with him, and her newly formed purpose was to wait on this official, at once, and lay before him the whole transaction. Ac- cordingly, bidding the woman good morning, she promptly repaired to the residence of the sheriff, whom luckily she found at home, and proceeded directly to disclose to him the whole story, concluding by producing the two coun- terfeit dollars. "Ah! here may be something tangible,' exclaimed the sheriff, who had been listening attentively, but doubtfully to the story. "Yes, these are bogus enough I can plain- ly see, though much art has been used to disguise them. But can it be that all this has been detected and managed so adroitly by you alone? Why, you must be a girl of a thousand! It was a prodigious swindle, besides a clear case of counterfeiting,' and must be promptly seen to. First, however, let me ask you a few questions. You say this Gale, as he calls himself, turned off into the woods - have you any idea where he may now be found?" i' I think I have," replied Kate. "I have understood there is a deserted log-house, with scarcely any clearing around it, standing in the midst of the woods, about two *  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC8035-00000145"/> 292       THE COUNTERFEITER. miles west of our house. I suspect he is there, and an ac- complice perhaps with him." "Very likely," rejoined the. sheriff'. "These gentry often hunt in couples. But who -Inows the way to this place well enough to go to it, this afternoon, scout round and ascertain whether the game is there?- You have a brother, I believe?" "Yes," replied Kate, "and he is perfectly familiar with the way; but it might be,managed more prudently, if some one went with him to take the lead -I have a friend " "A friend- who is he?" asked the other with a slightly amused look. "John Perley," returned the girl after a little hesitat- ing and blushing. "John Perley? I know him well," said the sheriff- "a young man of sense and resolution - I am glad to find you and he stand in the relation to each other in which I perceive you do. I will be a friend to you both. Now one question more - have you any personal interest in the recovery of the money which has been so cunningly swindled out of your father?" Kate, encouraged by the sheriff's friendly manner, frankly owned up all about this also, and made known the consequence it would be to her and Perley if the money was not recovered. "I am glad you told me this, Kate; for that I think   THE COUNTERYl91TlK.       293' you told me was your name," said the sheriff.  ' You have richly earned that money, and you shall yet have it. I shall have the power to compel your father to relin- quish it to you." "But my father must not be hurt. I hope you won't nave him prosecuted," responded Kate in a beseeching tone. "No, your father shall be spared -that is, if he will do right by you. Probably a prosecution will not be much pressed against him. If it is, we will make a State's eri- dence of him, so he will go clear, of course. Now, my brave girl, hurry home --send for Perley, and dispatch him  and your brother on their reconnoissance into the woods, and tell them, that, after sending off men to watch the roads on the west side of that wide forest, so as to se- cure the rascal or rascals, if they come out in that direc- tion, I will come round and meet them at the edge of the  woods, bordering your farm." It was considerably past noon, when Kate, on-her re- turn, reached the'borders of her father's farm, and as she did so, she was glad to perceive that her brother Tom had just come back from his dinner to that part of the field. south of the swell, in which he had been at work; for it was not her wish to return to the house till she had se- cured another object. - ' Tom," said she nimbly throwing herself over the fence into the field, and approaching him,-"Tom, where is your boat left?   &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC8035-00000146"/> 29       TBE COUNTEARPlTjKL a'At the shorei right down against here -I have just  rowed it down coming from dinner, thinking I would fish a little in this part of the pond towards night.

"Well Tom, I must at least answer that question. I want you should row me over to the landing, where the- old wood road comes down, leading to John Perley's place." 1' Now I should like to know what that is for what can you be up to, Kate?" "I want to see John immediately; and am going for hat purpose. Will you row me over, Tom?"

Stop! you look here, Kate," he at length said. "This queer wrinkle of yours coming over you so earnest to go to see John, means something. Something or other must have broke loose. Now I want you should tell me, what it is. I can keep the secret, if it is one; but' I want you should tell me, at some rate." "I have been thinking about that while coming over," she responded after a hesitating pause, "and perhaps I had better let you into a secret, which probably wont be a secret twenty-four hours longer. Yes, I will; so come ashore. We will take a seat on this log a little out of sight, and I will tell you all." And this she did, to the utter amazement of Tom, who as she concluded, leaped up, shook his doubled fist and ex- claimed, "Why, the infernal scoundrel! I will help fol- low him as long as I would a fifty dollar black fox, but what I will dog him to his hole and have his pelt, in the shape of that money he stole. Yes, I'll help put this through with a will. But look here, Kate, you are tired enough without going after John. You stay here .and I will go; and I'll have John here within an hour." "Thank you, Tom," said Kate, nodding assent to the proposition.  . /  /   &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC8035-00000147"/> 296       THE COUNTEIFEITER. ' But one thing more.- The sheriff said I -had earned all that money, if we got it back, as certainly as father had forfeited it. Now if we do get it- back, and I have it as the -sheriff says I shall, I will give you a hundred dollars." "Good! Well, now I am off," responded Tom rapidly hurrying away on his destination. Tom was nearly as good as his word. In a little over an hour, he re-appeared, accompanied by John Perley- a fine. frank looking young man of twenty-five. "Has Tom told you all?" asked Kate, after the lovers had silently shaken hands. "Yes-and I am proud of your sagacity and resolu- tion, -Kate; but it is now time this business was taken off your hands," said Perley. ' But do you understand that you are only to spy him out this afternoon, and then meet the sheriff at the edge of the woods at sunset?" again interrupted Kate. ' We do," replied the other, "Tom knows the way to the place where you suspect he is, like a book, and if he, whether alone or with an accomplice,is in the old log house, we will ascertain it -if not we may push on fur- ther; for Tom is as keen in finding and following up a trail as a blood hound." The party, by common consent now entered the boat, and were soon at the opposite shore; when Kate, feeling greatly relieved from having seen the enterprise on hand   THE COUNTERFEITER.        297: put in so good a train for ensuring success, leisurely took her way to the house; while the young men proceeded at once to the woods, and quickly disappeared within their dark recesses. Slowly, full slowly, to the greatly exercised Kate, lin- gered the long hours of that weary afternoon. So pain- fully oppressive was the suspense to her feelings; and so intense was her anxiety for the result of the measures she had inaugurated for the recovery of the money, and the punishment of the villain, who had so wickedly ob- tained it, that she could scarcely contain herself. She could neither work nor sit still-talk connectedly, nor entertain herself with any object which had usually been sufficient to fix her attention. But with moving restless- ly about, going first to one window'to gaze out vacantly a moment, and then to another, sitting down one minute and jumping up the next, or suddenly hastening out into the yard to return as suddenly, and through the whole of this unconscious routine, often glancing up at the declin- ing sun to note his tardy progress towards the mountains of the west, she made shift to wear out the remaining hours of this seemingly interminable day, until she had seen the lengthening shadows of the hill covering all the open fields and shooting out far on the gleaming waters of the pond. She then could restrain her impatience no longer; but seizing her berry-baslet to signify her old ex-  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC8035-00000148"/> 29S8   --   THE COUNTERFPITS9. cuse for her absence, she hastened: down the road for the appointed rendezvous at the border of the forest. ' When ashe reached there, she was gratified to find the sheriff, with two assistants, -already on the ground, but disappointed in finding that her brother and Perley were still absent. "We must wait," said the sheriff, to whom she be- trayed her disappointment, which was evidently not un- mi ngled; with concern for the safety of the two delinquents, "we must wait patiently. We shall probably hear from them soon, since, according to your account yqu succeeded in getting them off on their mission so early in the after- noon.  Yes, whether successful in making discoveries or not, they will be here soon; and in the meantime, my brave: -girl, I want you should go with me and show- me that counterfeit money. It is my duty to take charge of it-at once. -Besides, if the criminal is caught to-night, it will be wanted at court to-morrow morning; and if he is not, it will furnish good grounds for instituting a new search for him to-morrow, not only in the woods but over the country abroad." -Kate promptly assenting to the proposal, the sheriff brought up one of, the buggy wagons, in which he and his ,assistants had come, helped her in, and, following him- self, drove on to the swell; when, under her willing, guid- ance, he proceeded to the old cellar, and, finding the bo- gus dollars where she had seen them, transferred them all in the small bags he had brought for the purpose, to the   THE COUNTERFEITER,       299 wagon; and then drove back to the place where he had left his assistants; and the next hour was spent by them all in silently waiting, and anxiously listening for the ap- proach of the absent party from the woods.  But- no sound of footsteps reached their ears, and nothing save an occasional low, short trill of the retreating wood bird, was heard from any quarter of the now fast darkening forest; and they were about relinquishing all hope of the anxiously expected arrival that night, when the loud re- port of a pistol bursting suddenly upon the stillness of the night air, from some point not over a quarter of a mile distant, came sharply echoing down the valley, and a pro- longed, far-reaching halloo! as if earnestly invoking help. almost immediately followed. It is John's voice-it is John Perley's voice. I know it is! Run! run!-let us all run to his assis- tance," almost frantically exclaimed Kate, starting eagerly forwards into the woods in the direction of those signfi- cant sounds. "She is right," said the sheriff, turning to his assist- ants. "There may be trouble there, and the sooner we can be on hand the better, but with your matches, light the lanterns, which we shall need, and with them and the hand-cuffs you will find in my wagon, follow me up as close as you can." "fold up, Mr. Sheriff,'" cried one of the assistants.

But with all his exertions he did not come fully up with her, till having proceeded several furlongs up the valley she had paused to listen. "Do you hear anything?" asked the sheriff. "Yes," replied Kate, as soon as she could control her agitation --sufficiently to speak, "yes--a rustling among the bushes near that dark place under the hill on our left, a dozen rods ahead -I think they may be there. But I would call out for John.' "Halloo!!" accordingly exclaimed the sheriff in a measured, low, but distinct tone, "halloo, I say-John Perley; where are you?" "Here! at the foot of the hill," promptly came the re- sponse. I "Is all safe?" "The chief criminal is safe at least." 'Good! good! we will soon all be there." The two assistants, by this time, came hurrying up with the lighted lanterns, the, hand-cuffs and strong cords to secure the prisoner; when the whole party unshrinkingly   THE COUNTERFEITER.       301 marched forward, armed only with beechen cudgels, for the scene of action. As they passed round a thick clump of bushes, the light of the lanterns suddenly disclosed a scene as picturesque as it was startling. John Perley, with a face bathed with fresh blood, was crouching over the writhing, prostrate form of the swindler Gale, with one knee firmly planted on his breast and one hand des- perately grasping his throat. "Are you much hurt, John?" anxiously inquired Kate. "Stay a moment Kate- let me secure the murderous villain first, and then I will join you in the inquiry," interposed the sheriff, now coming forward with his mana- cles and securely fixing them on the wrists of the passive prisoner. "There, Perley, you can now release your gripe; for I see, by the wretch's exhaustion and panting, that he would -not give us much trouble, even without the hand-cuffs. So now for ydur answer to Kate's inquiry. Your's, though it has cost you some blood as I see, it is only a flesh wound, I conclude?" "Yes, only that," responded Perley rising and wiping the blood from his face, "only that. The bullet which the scoundrel, as I here overhauled him, intended for my head, only made a furrow along the outside of my cheek." "A lucky escape indeed; but now tell us briefly how all this came about so different from the programme?" Perley then proceeded to relate how he and Tom, hav-  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC8035-00000150"/> 302       THE COUNTERFEITER. ing reached the suspected log-house in the woods; lurked round several hours before they could feel fully satisfied that there iwas anybody within, though they noticed sev- eral indications that led them to believe so. But climb- ing a thickly foliaged tree, standing but a short distance from the house, and peering out,- they at length obtained a view of the interior; when they discovered not only Gale, but a confederate, just rising from a sort of bough bed, where they had evidently been taking a long nap, pre- paratory, as it was inferred, to a night march and conse- quent escape from the country; and in this conclusion, Perley and his young associate were soon confirmed by seeing the two confederates make up their packs and set them near the door, and then produce- some kind of vic- tuals and begin to eat. The two former then cautiously descended to the ground, and, retiring to a thicket near by, held a hurried consultation, and coming to the natu- ral conclusion that the criminals would inevitably escape before they should have time to return and get the sheriff on to the ground, they formed the bold resolution to un- dertake the capture themselves. Accordingly, with their heavy beechen cudgels in hand, after creeping noiselessly along to the last covert next the house, they- made a sud. den rush in upon the confederates, who, taken wholly by surprise, and cowerihg under the uplifted clubs of the de- termined assailants, at once yielded themselves up as pris- oners.- They were then ordered to deliver up their arms;.   THE OOJNTERFrBITR.       803 and, in pretended compliance, Gale took out and handeda over to Perley a dirk, while the other passed to Tom a loaded pistol, which they solemnly asserted were the only arms they had. The package of bank bills swindled out of Bidwell, was next sternly demanded, with an intimation that, as they were now known as counterfeiters, the case of Gale at least might be materially benefited by a prompt restitution. And the latter, after considerable wrangling, reluctantly consented, and gave up the package, which had not been opened, to Perley. As it was now sunset, the prisoners were at once put on the march back towards the head of the valley. But the latter had scarcely got fairly into the dense woods, before they, in spite of all that' could be done to prevent, suddenly bolted aside into the bushes, and, after making several quick tacks to confuse their pursuers, fled off with desperate speed in opposite di- rections, Gale, making towards the east, and his confeder- ate, towards the west. While Tom, with his pistol in hand, put himself on the trail of the latter, Perley. pursued Gale, who, however, had gained so much the start, that, he could not be overtaken till he had passed more than half way down the valley; when the fugitive, with the evident object of avoiding being driven out into the road below, took a sudden turn, and attempted to climb the hill so as to escape into the broad forest on the south. This movement being detected by: the pursuer, he turned across the angle thus made by the pursued, and came up  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC8035-00000151"/> 804       THE COUNTERFEITER. with him at the foot of the hill, where, in spite of the pistol shot there received, he bounded on the other with the leap of a tiger, and soon succeeded in pommeling and throttling him into submission. Matters having been brought to this issue, the whole of the triumphant party, with the sadly disabled and sullen prisoner in their midst, proceeded at once out to the road; when with one wagon devoted to the use of the sheriff and his- prisoner, and the other to the use of Perley, who wished to get his wound dressed that night, and the loving and anxious Kate, who would not consent to be separated from him, while the two assistants volunteered to follow on foot, the whole company moved down the road to the tavern, to obtain accommodations for the night, and be on hand for the trial next morning. By nine o'clock next morning - so swiftly flies the in- telligence of any new and startling event, even among the widely scattered inhabitants of a country town -by nine o'clock, a large crowd had assembled at the tavern to witness the proceedings of the trial. The officers had been active through the morning. The sheriff had gone up, and, under a mere summons, so worded as to pass for an order of arrest, brought down the miserable Bid- well; who, on being informed of what had happened, was utterly confounded, and swore revenge on Gale for so swindling him; but who, on beingfurther given to un- derstand he had implicated himself by having the coun-   THE COUNE Ri'IT ER.      380 terfeit money in possession, was filled with trepidation and alarm. A deputy sheriff, who had been stationedon the road on the west side of the great forest, had just arrived with Tom and the prisoner, whom he had run down, captured and delivered over to that officer at a late hour the preceding evening. The magistrate and prosecuting attorney had also arrived, and all was ready for trial. The Court of Inquiry, which was now open, was held in the largest room of the tavern. Behind a long table placed near one of the walls of the apartment, sat the magistrate; while facing him, on the opposite side, was calmly seated .the State's attorney, with two three law books before him. At one end of the table were placed the two sullen and crest-fallen prisoners, between two sheriff's assistants; and at the other end sat Perley, with a look of triumphant gratification, which the large patch on his wounded and somewhat swollen cheek, did not at all disguise. By his side sat Kate, glancing sharply around on the assembled company, though no one could tell, at any time, to what particular person her glances were di- rected. And next sat the nonchalant Tom, coolly chewing spruce gum, -these three persons being the only witnesses whom it had as yet been decided to use on the trial. Tom, Kate and Perley were then successively called to the stand; but as their testimony disclosed nothing of im- portance, which has not been made known to the reader in describing the separate or united parts taken by them, [-h se rt oru  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC8035-00000152"/> 806       THE COUNIi'EiKFii'lSI, it may-as well all be here omitted, except that part of Tom's evidence which went to identify his prisoner as the man who, about a fortnight before, had related to him the story respecting the treasure once buried somewhere among these mountains by the party fleeing from Mexico. ' Have the prisoners any counsel?" asked the magis- trate, glancing to Gale. "No," replied the latter morosely. "No, and don't want any. You have proved nothing against me except firing a, pistol, which was done in self-defence. Even that squinting spy, with all her long story about counterfeit money, has wholly failed to show any such money in my possession, and much less my trying to pass any." "Some things which this prisoner has said in his de- fence, as rough and improper as has been his manner of speaking in court, cannot be wholly gainsaid," remarked the magistrate, thou htfully. "In prosecutions of this kind, the accused must be shown either as passing, or at- tempting to pass, counterfeit coin, or as having it in pos- ession.- Has either of these been quite satisfactorily shown? Are there anymore witnesses to be offered on the part of the prosecution?" "We may have,- will the court suvspend a moment," replied the attorney, rising and taking the sheriff aside, and holding with him  a brief whispered consultation. This over, the former returned to the table, wrote a few lines, signed the paper and handed it to the sheriff, who   THE COUNTERFEITER .      307 took it, and passing out of the apartment, went to the, room where Bidwell had been requested to remain until called for. "Now Bidwell," said the officer closing the door after him as he entered the room, "I have come to decide what is to be done with you." "With me?" exclaimed Bidwell, trembling with alarm. "They don't think of touching me, do they? Why don't they condemn Gale, the only guilty one, and not try to drag me into the-scrape, who had not the least thought I was doing anything wrong?" "I am inclined to believe you innocent of any inten- tion of committing any crime," replied the' sheriff. "But that may not be enough to protect you. "As the testimony now stands, the case looks quite as much against you as against Gale. The Court has decided that to con- vict a man it must be shown either that he has passed counterfeit money, or has had it in his possession. Nei- ther of these facts has been proved against Gale; while you,. it is clearly seen, have been in possession of such money. This is shown by the evidence of your daughter Kate." "Then I am gone!" groaned Bidwell, " while the only guilty one will escape; and think! to be sent to the State's prison by the testimony of my own daughter, who must be meanly prying into the business!" "And supposing your daughter, whom I will not hear blamed, and whom you, yourself, should be proud of, in-     '!*.  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC8035-00000153"/> 308       THE COUNTERFEITER stead of blaming,- supposing she had not been the means of bringing this sly and wicked plot of that consummate villain to light, would not you soon have begun to pass that counterfeit money, and thus made out your own pass- port to the State's prison; while he would have long- be- fore escaped the country with all the good money out of which he swindled you?" "It might have been so, possibly, but now she has made it certain."' "That don't necessarily follow, Bidwell; for if you are saved, she is the one who havs done it. She has already earnestly interceded with the authorities in your behalf" "She-has? that's kind,--good girl,- good girl! But after all, that wont cure it. No, no, I am ruined - O, I am ruined!" "The case certainly looks bad enough ; but what would you give, Bidwell, to have a way proposed to save you? ' "'Give?   Why, I would give half I am worth in a minute. " "Well, perhaps you can get it arranged at an easier rate.  Now suppose the money you got swindled out of, can be recovered, will you freely consent to have it given to your daughter?" "Yes, yes, I will,-I will bind myself to do it. Now what is it you propose, to save me?" "To make you a State's evidence - to have you go im- mediately into court and tell your whole story, which will   THE COUNTERFB'lEB,       309 not only clear you, but convict Gale; for you can testify that he had the bogus coin in possession, and that he also passed it to you." "I can,-and will. But what guarantee am I to have that I shall not be prosecuted on my own testimony?" "This," said the sheriff, handing him the paper made out by the State's attorney.          ' ' All right," responded Bidwell, with brightening look - "All right, I am safe; and now they shall have my whole story. So now for the court room. Lead on, lead on, Mr.. Sheriff." The request was promptly complied with; and the next moment the sheriff ushered the new-made witness into the court room, and led him forward to the spot nearly in front of the magistrates recently occupied by the other witnesses. Gale turned pale when he saw his late infatuated dupe brought on to the stand, but soon rallying, tried to intim idate him by turning on him looks of savage ferocity and menace. Bidwell, however, in the consciousness of his own safety, and under the sense of the outrageous fraud that had been inflicted on him, proceeded, in a firm, de termined tone, with a minute and truthful detail of all that had taken place in his intercourse with the prisoner And notwithstanding the desperate attempts of Gale to brow-beat and confuse him, and notwithstanding he was compelled to admit that every movement in relation to the  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC8035-00000154"/> -310    -  THE: COUNTEBBbi't'lt. counterfeit money was: made, in appearance, to come from himself; yet the court, and all present, could- not fail to see through the whole of the nefarious scheme; and that Bid- well, from- first to last, had. been made the complete dupe of the, artful knave, into whose hands he had so blindly and lucklessly -fallen. As Bidwell concluded his testimony the State's attor- ney was rising to speak; 'when the magistrate interposed and said:- "Not a word, Mr. Attorney. It is needless to speak when you have got your case without it; for this disci- ple of Stephen Burroughs has done, in this transaction, too good justice to the school of devilish cunning in which he was evidently educated, to leave in the, mind of any rational man, who has heard the testimony, one single doubt, of his guilt. He is, consequently, to be held for trial at our county court now in session. - And though not much has been proved against the other prisoner, yet the presumption of his being an accessory in this scheme of passing or selling counterfeit money is, I think, strong enough to warrant his being placed in the same category, for the present. You will, therefore, Mr. Sheriff, have them both, as soon as may be, on the road to the county jail." "Within this very hour it shall be done, your honor," promptly responded the sheriff, taking up his hat, and, after whispering in Perley's ear to meet him with Kate   THE COUNTER'JrjLSK.  .    3" in the other room, immediately left the apartment. In a few minutes Perley and Kate, to whom he in turn had whispered a word, also departed, and at once repaired to the indicated room, which was the one that had been oc- cupied by Bidwell, but was now empty. Here they were soon joined by the sheriff, who, advancing, and seizing a hand of each of the young couple, cheerily exclaimed- "Now God bless you, my young friends! I sincerely congratulate - you on this signal triumph over wickedness and wrong, which you have been the main instruments in accomplishing; and here is your reward," he continued, drawing forth the recovered package of money, which Perley had put in his hands for safe keeping the evening before, and. placing it in the hands of the gratified Kate. "It is all right, I have examined it and there is not a dollar missing." "And what is to be your reward, Mr. Sheriff?" asked Kate playfully. "Why, my brave girl, if it is to be more than will be afforded me by the consciousness of having served the ends of public justice, then let it be the privilege of par- taking with you both, say about next Thanksgiving day night, your wedding supper." "(Granted, sir," said Kate with a blushing laugh ( Ay, and a thousand thanks besides," added Perley.

As before intimated, the county court, at its Grand. Jury term was in session at the time as a Court of In- quiry; and before night, on the same day, the prisoners had reached the seat of justice, and their case been laid before the Jury, who, on the testimony of the sheriff alone, it being understood there was to be no defence attempted, the next day brought in their indictment against both; when the accused, being brought into court and pleading guilty, were convicted and sentenced, - Gale to ten years, and the other to two years' imprisonment, and before Saturday night, the same week, they were safely lodged in the State's prison. Bidwell became a wiser and better man, completely cured of all disposition to listen to any more stories or dreams of buried treasure. Tom stuck by, and finally inherited the homestead. And the sheriff had the pleasure, the next Thanksgiving night, of sitting down, with other invited guests, to the bountiful wedding supper of Perley and Kate; who, through the means they' had received, through the court, as we have described, together with their own united industry and good manage- ment, became in the process of time, not only one of the most respected, but one of the very wealthiest families in all that part of the country.
