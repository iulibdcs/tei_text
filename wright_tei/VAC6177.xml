               <p>MANY years since, a traveller rode leisurely along the broad, well-beaten road of
                  a thickly-settled and wealthy neighborhood in Louisiana. The weather was balmy,
                  and the air deliciously fragrant with the perfume of wild shrubs and flowers that
                  lined the roadside. Festooned from tree to tree, the gorgeous yellow jasmin hung
                  in lofty arches, now mingling its bright golden clusters with the glossy, green
                  foliage of the proud magnolia; now climbing around the outspread branches of the
                  tall cypress, in wreathy crowns, fit emblems for the brow of lovely Spring.
                  Already the broad fields were verdant with the growing crops, promising an
                  abundant harvest; and from a distance, the chanting of the laborers, mingling with
                  the merry voices of children at play—the chirping of the blithe sparrow, hopping
                  gleefully from spray to spray, and the impassioned song of the wondrous
                  mocking-bird, as sweeping<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6177-00000003"/> ing through the
                  air, he warbled forth his mysterious melody—all appeared in beautiful harmony with
                  Nature's noble panorama.</p>
               <p>To Horace Layton, our traveller, who had made a speedy trip from his Northern
                  home, the scene appeared like enchantment. He had left the earth wrapped in the
                  ghostly mantle of snow—the leafless trees glistening in their icy coats, and
                  seeming too lifeless to be ever again clad in living verdure; and he had left, far
                  behind him, the sad cry of "Give, givea morsel, or I perish!" Horace Layton had
                  travelled many miles in the Southwest, and no object of commiseration had come to
                  view. The negroes that he frequently met passing to and fro along the road, were
                  well clothed, cheerful and healthy in appearance; and as his mind was plentifully
                  stored with Northern antipathies, it is no matter of wonder that the fair prospect
                  before him filled his bosom with pleasurable emotions. When, by nightfall, he
                  reached his place of destination, and alighted at the handsome residence of Major
                  Wallace, the cordial greeting he received, and the comfort and elegance by which
                  he found himself surrounded, completed the favorable impression that had been made
                  upon him on his first entrance into the proscribed land.</p>
               <p>Horace Layton was a native of New-York city; he was gentlemanly in appearance,
                  agreeable in conversation, and his literary acquirements were considerable—yet his
                  intellect was, by no means, of a superior order. The greatest defect in his
                  character was a want of self-reliance: he was nervously sensitive, and religiously
                  inclined—though his religion consisted more of superstitious stitious fears than a
                  firm reliance upon the promises of the blessed Peace-Maker. He was unfortunate in
                  having been, from his boyhood, under the control of his brother-in-law, "Parson
                  Blake," who professed to be a minister of the Gospel, but in reality, used
                  religion as a mere cloak beneath which, for a time, his vices were effectually
                  hid. The parson was a thoroughgoing abolitionist, not from any real sympathy he
                  had for the African race—in truth, he cared as little for slave as slaveholder—but
                  the abolition of slavery was the popular theme of the day in his locality, and
                  popularity, in his estimation, was an important object. He likewise, together with
                  this notable sect in general, entertained some very ambitious views with regard to
                  the future destination of the South—something similar to the project once
                  entertained by the ambitious Aaron Burr—though, truly, the sedition of the
                  abolitionist, so fraught with ruinous consequences, is far more nefarious than was
                  the plot of the notorious traitor.</p>
               <p>Parson Blake pretended to view the Southerners as a set of piratical desperadoes,
                  from whom it would be a work of righteousness to wrest their birthrights; and in
                  confidential communications, the fraternity conceived it to be an easy matter to
                  effect their designs, by causing a disaffected state of the slave population
                  toward their owners. The two races could not then peaceably inhabit the same
                  country, neither could this great "Eden of America" be given up to the
                  semi-civilized and destructive African. The aspiring party had resolved upon a
                  total revolution in Southern affairs; and a question that required some ingenuity
                  in adjusting, was the disposal of the valuable ruins, after the work of desolation
                  had been accomplished.</p>
               <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6177-00000004"/>
               <p>"The South must then come under the undisputed jurisdiction of the abolition
                  party," said Parson Blake, diving his hands deep down into his pockets that, to
                  his excited imagination, already felt heavy from the proceeds of cotton and sugar
                  plantations. "It must be given into our possession, sirs, and surely, 'tis nothing
                  more than our due as a recompense for the glorious work of emancipating a much
                  abused race, and affording them gospel privileges."</p>
               <p>Quite consistent, Parson Blake; yet possibly your plan will prove less feasible
                  than you seem to imagine. It appears to be a peculiarity of your party that, in
                  overly-pious zeal for the slave's soul, you quite lose sight of his bodily wants.
                  "Set him free," is your cry, and, for aught you care, he may starve or fallback
                  into his original state of barbarism—anything but remain in his present
                  condition—a contented and cherished bondman—his true state when not assailed by
                  the religious jugglery of the abolition incendiary. As for such unimportant items
                  in the commonwealth, as Southern white people, it is not presumed that exalted
                  beings, such as those who compose the abolition party, would be at all concerned
                  for their weal, particularly when it is taken into consideration that Southern
                  wealth is the goal that the saintly host have in view.</p>
               <p>Horace Layton was unacquainted with the <emph>peculiar views</emph> of the
                  abolition party. His own opinion of slavery was based upon having been taught to
                  believe the slave denied all human rights—as inexpressibly degraded, and classed
                  with the brute creation; consequently, he was averse to the system of slavery, and
                  anticipated but little comfort during his sojourn where it existed. He really
                  thought his brother-in-law a model of Christianly virtues, and there was nothing
                  he more dreaded than to incur his disapprobation—in short, he was a mere tool in
                  the hands of the wily parson. Left to the dictates of his own inclinations, Horace
                  Layton would have passed thro' life as an amiable and inoffensive man, but, acting
                  under the influence of Parson Blake, the sequel will prove him to have been worse
                  than a heathen—a traitor to his own fireside.</p>
               <p>It was to gratify Parson Blake that Horace went South. Application had been made
                  for a teacher to take charge of a flourishing school in Louisiana. The salary was
                  liberal, and the parson well knew that he was certain of as much of Horace's
                  earnings as he thought proper to demand. In the same vocation at home he received
                  a mere pittance; so the sage parson had no wish for him to remain and earn a bare
                  subsistence, when, elsewhere, he could add very materially to his own income. The
                  parson did not say, give me thus, or so much for my own special benefit. Oh, no!
                  he was much too cunning for any such avowal of his real intentions. It was through
                  the veneration that Horace had for religious matters; his interest in charitable
                  institutions, colonization societies, &amp;c., that the parson exerted so much
                  influence over him; and for these purposes, ostensibly, subscriptions were
                  solicited, that, in reality, were appropriated to his own uses! The parson also
                  believed that Horace could be of essential service to the abolition party, by
                  giving information concerning matters that might be deemed necessary, and in
                  circulating incendiary pamphlets and documents, or any other means of exciting the
                  wished for rebellion that so constantly glowed in the pious bosoms of the
                     <emph>worthy</emph> brotherhood.</p>

               <head>Chapter Second.</head>
               <p>IN our opening chapter, Horace Layton had just reached the residence of Major
                  Wallace, where he was an expected guest. The school of which he was to take
                  charge, was under the superintendence of that gentleman, who preferred the teacher
                  boarding with him, as his family was quite small. He was a man of many estimable
                  qualities, of wealth, and high standing in the community.</p>
               <p>"I trust, Mr. Layton," said Major Wallace, as he shook Horace warmly by the hand,
                  "that we shall be good friends. I hope you have no very great repugnance to our
                  peculiar institution?"</p>
               <p>This remark was more to the point than Major Wallace might have supposed. Horace
                  Layton colored with embarrassment, and was stammering something of a reply, when a
                  little girl, of some nine or ten summers, bounded into the room, saying:</p>
               <p>"See here, papa, what a sweet little rabbit. I outran Cousin Mary and caught it in
                  the pasture."</p>
               <p>Major Wallace folded her to his bosom, and addressing Horace, said:</p>
               <p>"This is Annie, my only living child. Four others lie beside their mother in the
                  graveyard." Just as he spoke, a young lady came into the room, and was introduced
                  by him as his ward, Miss Mary Danville. Horace Layton had seen many beautiful
                  girls in his own land, but he had never met with a face that appeared so lovely to
                  him as that of Mary Danville. Her complexion was delicately fair, and her hair and
                  eyes of a light brown hue; yet it was not so much beauty of features and
                  complexion, as sweetness of expression and graceful, unaffected manner, that
                  rendered her so peculiarly lovely. She was an orphan of English parentage. Though
                  a Southerner by birth, her parents had died during the prevalence of yellow fever,
                  and as Major Wallace was distantly related to her mother, he took charge of the
                  little orphan Mary, who was at the time but eight years of age, and she received
                  the same careful training that had been bestowed upon his own children. Her father
                  was an Episcopal minister, and left but little of the world's store for his child;
                  but by careful management on the part of her kind guardian, the small capital
                  amounted to something quite handsome by the time she had reached her eighteenth
                  year.</p>
               <p>Horace Layton had never been in the presence of persons more disposed "to give the
                  stranger happy cheer," or calculated to please, than the family of Major Wallace,
                  and when, at a late hour, he sought his pillow, he roamed through evergreen
                  arbors, the melody of airy songsters chimed upon his ear, and sweet Mary Danville
                  was by his side. He culled the blue-eyed violets that grew in their pathway, and,
                  twining a wreath, he would have placed it upon her fair brow, but at that instant,
                  the cold, leaden eyes of Parson Blake glared upon him, and seemed to emit fiery
                  serpents that darted their fatal thrusts at the heart of Mary. Horace sprang
                  forward to protect her—the effort awoke him. "Thank Heaven," he sighed, "'twas but
                  a dream."</p>

               <head>Chapter Third.</head>
               <p>A YEAR passed rapidly away—the most pleasant that Horace Layton had ever known. At
                  too great a distance from Parson Blake to be under his immediate control, his
                  character assumed something of independence and manliness; yet, unfortunately, the
                  parson still held his better nature captive by his letters, in which he warned him
                  against falling into the pernicious habits of the Southerners, and used every
                  persuasive art in his power to induce him to act as an incendiary; but Horace
                  Layton had found the slaves both contented and comfortable. He saw that slavery in
                  the Southern States was a system of judicious control over a race of human beings
                  who, as yet, were incapable of self-government, or of thriving as a community upon
                  the strength of their own intellect, unaided by superior natures and intelligence.
                  He wrote to Parson Blake, telling him the exact state of affairs, not having the
                  slightest suspicion that his worthy relative was in no way concerned for the
                  prosperity of any race or person, apart from himself. The Parson had no faith in
                  the idea that "This world was made for Csar, and for Titus, too," but seemed to
                  think it a compound, intended expressly for the benefit of Parson Blake! For
                  Horace Layton he entertained the feeling of perfect contempt, that is certain to
                  exist with evilminded persons toward the weak tools of their iniquitous
                  transactions. He laughed scornfully while reading the conscientious letters of
                  Horace; but, in his replies plies, he expressed the uttermost grief and fear, lest
                  his darling brother should be led astray by the wily Southerners. He exhorted him
                  to "pull the scales from his eyes," and see matters as he wished him. The
                  cunningly devised epistles of the parson, after a time, had the desired effect.
                  Horace was led to imagine evil where it did not exist, and to become as an asp in
                  the bosoms of the noble souls who cherished him.</p>
               <p>The communications of Parson Blake kept the spirit of fanaticism alive in the mind
                  of Horace Layton, but did not prevent the charms of the young Southerner, Mary
                  Danville, from leading him captive to her feet, much to the regret of Major
                  Wallace. Mary's happiness was as dear to him as if she had been his own child. He
                  did not all admire the character of Horace Layton—his evident want of firmness and
                  decision was not in unison with the feelings of the independent and whole-souled
                  old Southerner. He blamed himself for having not foreseen the probability of the
                  young people falling in love, when thrown so constantly in the society of each
                  other, particularly when both were possessed of pleasing attributes. There were
                  several young planters in the neighborhood who had sought Mary's hand, and it had
                  been the favorite plan of her guardian to have her settle near him, as the
                  mistress of a comfortable home; but fate seemed to have ordered otherwise. The
                  mild, subdued manner, and gentlemanly address of Horace Layton, had found sympathy
                  in the gentle heart of Mary; and Major Wallace gave a reluctant consent to the
                  union. He exacted a promise, however, that they should still continue to reside
                  with him for several years, at least—an arrangement most<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000007"/> agreeable to Mary, for she could not bear the
                  thought of leaving her kind old friend and his little Annie, to whom she had ever
                  been as an elder sister. Neither Major Wallace or Mary had ever suspected Horace
                  Layton of being an abolitionist. He had sedulously concealed his views, and in
                  fact, since his residence in the South, his fanatical notions had been so
                  materially weakened that, in all probability, had it not been for the
                  communications of the <emph>worthy</emph> parson, the flame would have died out
                  entirely for want of fuel.</p>
               <p>Horace did not ask Parson Blake's advice relative to his marriage with Mary
                  Danville, for had he objected, Horace would not have had courage to resist, and he
                  really loved Mary too well to give her up. He determined to marry, and take the
                  consequences, feeling certain that if the parson were but acquainted with Mary, he
                  would consider her a desirable companion for the most worthy, and he also supposed
                  that the parson's prohibition would be based upon the idea of her being in favor
                  of the "objectionable institution," and Horace flattered himself that he could
                  easily induce his wife to adopt his views on the subject—consequently, the only
                  cause of difference between them to be removed. But he was greatly mistaken in her
                  character. Mary was a sensible and patriotic woman. She upheld the rights of her
                  country, and she believed the Southerners to be the most consistent and faithful
                  friends that the negro race had upon the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>Parson Blake was taken completely by surprise when he heard of Horace Layton's
                  marriage. He had never supposed, for an instant, that his supple victim would
                  presume to take a wife without his permission; and he at once conceived a mortal
                  aversion to the innocent Mary. He considered that she had stepped between himself
                  and his pecuniary interest, and he had no idea of letting Horace go, so long as
                  there was the least possible chance of retaining him in his power. The parson was
                  very shrewd, and knew exactly how to advance in the present emergency. He wrote a
                  gracious and affectionate letter of congratulation, professed already to have the
                  feelings of a relative toward the young wife, and wound up by complaining of
                  having to deprive his family of necessary comforts, in order to sustain the many
                  charitable societies, of which he was a leading member. He begged that his pious
                  brother would "send a hundred or so." Horace, as usual, sent the money, and felt
                  as if he had come off conqueror—so very pleasantly had the parson commented upon
                  his marriage.</p>

               <head>Chapter Fourth.</head>
               <p>IN the second year after Mary's marriage she presented her husband with twin
                  children—a son and daughter. There was great rejoicing upon the occasion at the
                  old homestead. The Major jokingly declared, that if the little strangers were
                  intended as a specimen of the arrangement entered into by the young couple, it
                  would be necessary to enlarge the premises forthwith. The babes were pronounced
                  perfect beauties by the whole neighborhood. Annie Wallace elected herself chief
                  nurse, and she required half-a-dozen<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6177-00000008"/>
                  little girls as assistants. Then "Mammy," the family nurse, was obliged to
                  superintend matters, so there was no danger of the "young arrivals" being
                  neglected. The children were much alike in features, and bore a strong resemblance
                  to their mother. Mary wished Major Wallace to name the children. He called the boy
                  "Charles," after himself, and the girl "Ellen," in remembrance of his wife. Horace
                  Layton was the happiest of men. He actually laid aside two letters of the
                  parson's, that came in quick succession, for future perusal. He was too much under
                  the influence of good old Dame Nature just then to be easily turned away from the
                  contemplation of his proud position, even by Parson Blake, and he really began to
                  dread the epistolary lectures and demands upon his purse; yet the firmly-rooted
                  habits of early youth would again arise like spectres before his mind, and he then
                  feared the great change which had taken place in his feelings might be
                  attributable to the Satanic influence, against which his kind censor had tried so
                  sedulously to guard him. At such times he was sorely troubled, and could scarcely
                  be tempted to happiness by his lovely family, and the kind friends who surrounded
                  him. After Horace Layton's marriage, Major Wallace had manifested every
                  disposition to treat him as a relative, rather than as a stranger. He tried to
                  persuade him to settle in the South permanently, and advised him to purchase land;
                  many tracts were being disposed of, at low rates, that were so situated as to be
                  increasing in value, and he supposed that Horace had funds laid by, as he was
                  evidently very economical in his habits, and his school yielded a considerable
                  income; and since his marriage he had been at no expense for board—Major Wallace
                  refusing any remuneration for himself and family. Horace declined making
                  purchases, saying that he had no funds; and he refused Major Wallace's offer to
                  lend him the necessary amount, fearing that he might not have it in his power to
                  repay the obligation. His reply filled the mind of Major Wallace with sad
                  forebodings for Mary and her children. He could not imagine what Horace did with
                  his money, and he felt rejoiced to find, upon investigation, that Mary's portion
                  yet remained untouched in the bank. He feared that as Horace seemed to have a
                  fancy for making his own funds fly off invisibly, he might dispose of his wife's
                  little fortune in the same way.</p>
               <p>Major Wallace knew nothing of Parson Blake, or of the delusive influence he
                  exerted over the weak Horace Layton—his abject slave—who neglected his real
                  obligations to his Creator, his family, and himself, in his blind infatuation and
                  submission to this emissary of the Evil One.</p>
               <p>True to his noble nature, Major Wallace did not confine his interest in the
                  welfare of Mary and her children to mere sentiment. He placed several thousand
                  dollars in bank, to be upon interest until the children were grown, when it was to
                  be divided between them and their mother. He thought it best not to mention his
                  donation at the time to either Mary or her husband, but determined to take some
                  suitable opportunity for doing so, and candidly state his object to Horace, and,
                  if possible, win his confidence.</p>

               <head>Chapter Fifth.</head>
               <p>JACK was one of the favorite house servants or Major Wallace. He was verging upon
                  twenty, and was what is usually termed "a proud negro." He was not possessed of
                  much intellect, but an unusual share of self-esteem. Jack believed the virtues of
                  the human family to be centred in his master's household—a very large proportion
                  being claimed for himself. He was the son of "Uncle Peter," the oldest and one of
                  the most faithful servants on the plantation.</p>
               <p>Horace Layton took quite a fancy to Jack, and frequently conversed with him upon
                  religious matters, and had several times attempted teaching him to read, but Jack
                  had no particular fancy for literature. His talents were not "formed for great
                  enterprises;" the height of his ambition was for stylish dress, and to be
                  considered much superior to other negroes. On Sunday, when attired for church in
                  his neat black suit, and boots that crumpled up his feet into something of a
                  genteel shape—his white fur hat placed jockily upon the side of his head, and his
                  little fancy cane "to keep the dogs away," why, Jack was the happiest of mortals,
                  and felt himself to be an object of universal envy.</p>
               <p>Uncle Peter never liked Horace Layton, and was rather jealous of his fancy for
                  Jack. Upon one occasion he had overheard Horace talking too familiarly, as he
                  thought, upon the subject of freedom to him, and he sternly ordered Jack back to
                  his work, saying:</p>
               <p>"'Scuse me, Master Horace, but it won't do to talk much to dat boy; he's too sassy
                  anyhow."</p>
               <p>The fact was, Uncle Peter had once spent some months in New-York city. He had been
                  induced by abolitionists to leave his old master, the father of Major Wallace, who
                  was, at the time, travelling for his health, and had taken Peter, then a young
                  man, along with him. Ever since that period Uncle Peter's opinion of the North and
                  purgatory amounted to much the same thing; and when out of humor with any of his
                  fellow servants, his most vindictive wish was, that his master would send the
                  offenders North and set them free.</p>
               <p>By way of inducing Jack to pay more attention to his book, Horace told him that if
                  he should ever become free, his being educated would place him upon a level with
                  white men, at the North in particular. His flattery, however, did not act as the
                  desired stimulus, but proved of very serious injury to the once contented and
                  happy negro. As Uncle Peter truthfully remarked, "Jack had got some mighty curious
                  notions in his head." He neglected his work, was insolent and overbearing, and
                  several times impertinent to his old father.</p>
               <p>Uncle Peter complained to his master of the boy's conduct, but the Major thought
                  that, perhaps, the old man was too exacting, and took but little notice of the
                  matter.</p>
               <p>One day, when called to his dinner, Jack walked into the room with a very
                  dignified air, and surveying the table, turned off with contempt, saying, there
                  was nothing on it he could eat.</p>
               <p>"What's dat you say," cried Uncle Peter. "Well, just get your master to send you
                  North; I guess you<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6177-00000010"/> will find your
                  appetite there—ha, ha, ha!" and the old man laughed until the tears ran down his
                  cheeks. "Look here, boy," he continued, "Look on dis table; here is bread, meat,
                  potatoes, molasses, and buttermilk, yet you can't find nothin' to eat. Well, go
                  North, dat's all de advice I can give you."</p>
               <p>"Dat's just where I want to go," said Jack, pertly; "I want to be free, and
                  'sociate wid de ladies and gentlemen of de North."</p>
               <p>"Oh, dat's your notion, is it?" said Uncle Peter. "Well, Jack, I once was as
                  foolish as you is, and tuck a notion to be free, and all dat sort of thing, but
                  bless de Lord for his goodness—he brung me safe through my trials. Set right down
                  here, boy, and let me tell you all about my visit to de great city of
                  New-York."</p>
               <p>"You see, Jack," said Uncle Peter, "I went travelling wid old master, who was
                  mighty sickly. Well, we got on to de North widout much trouble, considerin', and I
                  tell you dey has fine things dare sure—but dat don't do de nigger no good. I was
                  mighty well pleased as long as old master stayed, for den I fared fine; but some
                  abolitions and free niggers tuck me in hand, and would hab me free whedder or no.
                  I kep on tellin' dem I was free enough for anybody to be, but dey would keep after
                  me till I guv it up, and stole away one night from old master. Lor! I did feel so
                  mean when I cum to think how kind he had always bin to me. De abolitions treated
                  me right well for a little while, till old master was clean out ob sight—den dey
                  told me to go to work and make a livin'. Well, I 'spected to do dat, but sich work
                  as I had to do! Lor, don't talk! and de little bit of pay—not worth looking at. I
                  tell you, boy, I can sell a pint of pinders here for more dan I could make in a
                  day by my work in dat place. It tuk all my earnin's to pay de free niggers for my
                  board, and sich board! oh, lor! it makes me laugh to think about it. I slep way up
                  yonder in a tall old house; didn't have a bit of bed; mighty little cover, and
                  just next to nothin' to eat. I was hungry all de time, and fell away to skin and
                  bones. I had no good close to wear, for dem free niggers stole ebery one of my
                  fine things, and kept me workin', workin' for dem all day long and half de night.
                  On Chrismus day, for a wonder, dey let me off from workin', and one free black
                  fellow give me a shillin'. 'Now,' says he, 'don't you feel rich? I reckon you
                  neber had so much money to spend in your life!'</p>
               <p>"'You is mighty mistaken,' says I. 'Many a time has I had fifty or sixty dollars
                  at a time in my pocket—my own money, made by sellin' my crops.' He just busted out
                  laughin' in my face, 'and,' says he, 'if dat is true, all I have to say, is dat
                  you was a mighty great fool for stayin' here.'</p>
               <p>"I was too mad and flustrated to say nuthin' to de rascal, but tuk my old cap, and
                  went out in de street. It was Sunday, and tho' I had been in the city for six
                  months, I had never bin inside of a church—so I felt mightily in de notion of
                  hearing de sound of preachin' once more. Dare is no trouble in findin' churches
                  dar; dey is stuck all about like sugar-plums on a pound cake; so I just went in
                  the fust one I cum to. I sorter crep in, for I was dressed so mean I was 'shamed
                  for de folks to see me. Dey was singin' and grindin' on a<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000011"/> big organ when I went in, and I walked mighty soft,
                  and slipped up in a corner; but, bless you, I had just got dare, when a mighty
                  nice dressed man cum up to me, and tuk hold of a little scrap of my sleeve, like
                  it was pisin', and pinted to de door.</p>
               <p>"'I cum to hear de gospel,' says I; 'I ain't heard a word of preachin' since I
                  left home.'</p>
               <p>"'Begone,' says he, in a whisper; 'you disturb de congregation—dis is no place for
                  you.'</p>
               <p>"So I left de house of de Lord, and thought, as I sneaked out, dat I might live to
                  be a hundred years old in de good old South, and never see a poor nigger driv out
                  of church.</p>
               <p>"Well, I kep' gettin' on worse all de time, and couldn't get much work to do
                  anyhow, for you never did see sich a sight of poor white folks and niggers, all
                  lookin' after a job to keep dem from starvin'.</p>
               <p>"One day I had walked about till I was tired lookin' for some work; at last I cum
                  to de wharf where de boats was cummin' in and goin' out, jist as fast as could be,
                  so I went aboard a fine steamer, and asked de captin' to set me to work.</p>
               <p>"'Why, man,' says he, 'I have taken on my load, and shall start back to
                  New-Orleans in an hour or so.'</p>
               <p>"'New-Orleans,' says I, and my heart banged right up into my mouth. 'Old master's
                  place ain't so very far from New-Orleans.'</p>
               <p>"'Who was your master?' says he.</p>
               <p>"'Mr. Walter Wallace,' says I, 'and if I could get back to him, he should be my
                  master all de days of my life.' 'I know him very well," said de captin; 'he is a
                  fine man.' 'Dat's de truth,' said I, and I fell to cryin' like a baby; de more I
                  thought about home de worse I felt, till, at last, I just had to set down on de
                  bench, and cry good fashion.</p>
               <p>"De captin seemed right sorry for me, and asked if I wanted to go home.</p>
               <p>"'Lor!' says I, 'don't talk, master; if I could get back, all de abolitions and
                  free niggers in de world could not keep me.'</p>
               <p>"'Well,' says he, 'go get your goods and chattels, and be here in two hours. I
                  know Mr. Wallace will take you home and forgive you.'</p>
               <p>"I told him I had all my goods and chattels on my back, and might as well stay.
                  So, thank de Lord for his goodness to me, I got back home. Old master came out and
                  shook hands with me. 'Peter.' says he, 'I don't think your visit to the North has
                  improved your looks any.'</p>
               <p>"'No, master,' says I, 'but I have bin punished mightily for my wrong doin', and I
                  deserved it: but, de Lord willin', I will try to keep de straight road
                  hereafter.'"</p>
               <p>Uncle Peter resumed his meal, and Jack also found that he could eat the wholesome
                  food before him. He was very thoughtful for a while, after hearing of his father's
                  troubles, and seemed disposed to be satisfied with his comfortable condition. He
                  did not feel quite so anxious to try his fortune as an independent individual; he
                  was not very courageous, and did not like Uncle Peter's description of abolition
                  hospitality, and his usual bill of fare while sojourning among the "Greeleyites."
                  Jack was not really a bad negro; he had been much indulged, as Southern house
                     servants<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6177-00000012"/> usually are—was very easily
                  flattered, and of shallow intellect. He was devotedly attached to his master, and
                  usually attentive to his duties.</p>
               <p>In justice to Horace Layton, we must remark that he had no idea of causing the
                  mischief which resulted from his objectionable conversations with Jack. The
                  constant appeals to his Christianity and benevolence, from the parson, and his
                  abolition documents, caused him to act as many others have done in the same
                  situation—that is, do much harm and no good. Major Wallace had not objected to his
                  teaching Jack to read. He did not suppose the boy would make progress enough to
                  materially injure or benefit him.</p>
               <p>For some time Horace labored diligently in the search after Jack's intellectual
                  abilities, but, at last, gave it up in despair, and Jack was fast <emph>falling
                     back</emph> and becoming a faithful and contented servant, when an unlooked-for
                  occurrence again placed him under the dominion of the Evil One.</p>

               <head>Chapter Sixth.</head>
               <p>ONE pleasant summer evening, Mary and Horace were walking in the large
                  flower-garden fronting the house. The sun was slowly sinking behind rich clouds of
                  purple and crimson, and his parting rays shed a mellow, golden light over the
                  surrounding landscape; many beautiful flowers were in bloom—Horace gathered his
                  favorite blossoms, and forming a tasty bouquet, handed it to Mary. She received it
                  with her usual gentle, affectionate manner. Attired in a simple white dress, her
                  wavy brown hair falling in ringlets over the delicately-tinted cheeks, Mary
                  appeared to have lost but little of her girlish loveliness. With tenderness and
                  pride, Horace gazed upon her sweet face. Suddenly, a strange feeling took
                  possession of his mind—it seemed a disagreeable reminiscence, with which Parson
                  Blake was, in some way, connected. He shuddered with undefinable dread, and in
                  silence offered his arm to his wife. They walked on for some moments without
                  speaking. At length Mary said:</p>
               <p>"Why are you so sad, Horace? I thought when we first came into the garden, you
                  were unusually cheerful."</p>
               <p>He replied, "I cannot account for the sudden feeling of dread that came over me
                  this evening. It seemed a presentiment of impending evil."</p>
               <p>"I trust not," said Mary, cheerfully. "You know, Horace, I give you credit for
                  being very superstitious."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I deserve all the credit you give upon that score, little wife," said he,
                  smiling. "I very often wish I could overcome some of my superstitious
                  notions."</p>
               <p>A turn in the walk brought them in sight of Annie, and the little Charlie and
                  Ellen, frolicking upon the lawn. The twins were then three years old, and
                  remarkable for their beauty and sprightliness. As their parents drew near, the
                  children ran to meet them; but the Major came along at that same moment, on his
                  favorite steed, Nimrod, and as the little ones were for having their accustomed
                  ride, they turned toward him, crying:</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6177-00000013"/>
               <p>"Take me up, grand-pa! take me up, grand-pa!"</p>
               <p>Major Wallace stopped his horse, and placing them before him, folded an arm
                  securely around each. Annie jumped up behind her father. Charlie seized the bridle
                  and cried, "woa! woa!" at every step, while little Ellen laughed and clapped her
                  hands with delight. So they cantered off homeward.</p>
               <p>Horace and Mary walked on leisurely, and when they reached the house, found a
                  stranger in conversation with Major Wallace, who proved to be a book-pedler. He
                  was well dressed, and appeared fair enough, with the exception of a singularly
                  disagreeable countenance. As Annie, in her usual quaint way of expression, said,
                  "he looked so unfeeling," which was really a very truthful description of the
                  hardened-looking person-age.</p>
               <p>His stock of books was very good, consisting of fine bibles and other valuable
                  works. Major Wallace purchased from him to a considerable amount. When the family
                  had left the room, with the exception of Horace, the pedler came close to him, and
                  inquired if he was correct in supposing him to be Horace Layton? Receiving an
                  affirmative answer, he handed him a couple of letters, and going to his
                  Jersey-wagon, which stood at the gate, he took out a large package, and gave it
                  also to Horace. The letters proved to be from an abolition editor and Parson
                  Blake. The package contained incendiary documents, of every description, which the
                  editor entreated Horace to distribute whenever he could find an opening. He had
                  been advised by Parson Blake to employ him as an agent, and did not doubt his
                  worthiness to fill so important an office. Poor Horace had serious doubts
                  concerning the "worthiness of the office."</p>
               <p>Parson Blake communicated intelligence of a deeply affecting nature to Horace—the
                  death of his only sister, who was the parson's wife.</p>
               <p>"Your sister died"—thus wrote the parson—"praying for your welfare. The
                  indifference you have manifested toward us lately, caused her the greatest
                  uneasiness of mind. She feared that you had been caught in the snares of the
                  ungodly, and that your poor soul was in great peril. O Horace! much I fear your
                  unkindness hastened her end. I shall never cease to regret having influenced you
                  to go southward; but I was fully impressed with the belief that you were ready and
                  willing to fight in the <emph>good cause</emph>."</p>
               <p>Horace Layton became a prey to remorse after reading the artful parson's letter,
                  and was ready at once to fall back into his former weak subjection to the will of
                  his wicked adviser. He felt inexpressibly wretched, and having no disposition to
                  sleep, left the house for a walk, hoping the cool night air would calm his
                  feverish restlesness. The moon shone brightly, and objects at some distance were
                  plainly visible. He strolled toward the river, and had not gone very far on the
                  road when his attention was attracted by two persons standing beneath a clump of
                  trees, who seemed anxious to avoid observation; but as Horace drew near, they
                  advanced to meet him, and he discovered them to be Jack and the pedler.</p>
               <p>"You gave us a good scare," said the pedler addressing himself to Horace. "We
                  thought the old gentleman was upon our track."</p>
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6177-00000014"/>
               <p>Horace felt his face crimson with indignation. He saw plainly that the man was an
                  incendiary, and considered him as an accomplice. He made no reply, but spoke to
                  Jack, and told him that his master had called for him a short time previous.</p>
               <p>"Let him call till he gets tired," said the boy with an insolent air. "I is got as
                  much right to be free as he is."</p>
               <p>"That is a fine fellow," said the pedler, slapping him upon the shoulder, in a
                  coaxing way. "Be independent, man."</p>
               <p>From the first moment of seeing the pedler, Horace had felt an aversion toward
                  him. He was disgusted with the man's low familiarity, and had no inclination to be
                  associated with him in any respect. He turned toward home, supposing that Jack
                  would follow.</p>
               <p>It is impossible to describe the state of Horace Layton's mind at that time.
                  Remorseful grief for his sister's death; fear of the parson's anathemas, and the
                  consciousness of acting dishonorably toward Major Wallace, in not immediately
                  making him acquainted with the true character of the pedler, such conflicting
                  emotions rendering him miserable. He could not expose the pedler without
                  implicating Parson Blake and many others, whom he found to be connected with him;
                  and though he disliked the pedler's appearance and manner, he was not disposed to
                  think him a villain, or surely the parson would not be associated with him. Horace
                  Layton believed the man to be engaged in teaching the slaves to resist the
                  authority of their owners; yet with the inconsistency of his weak nature, tried to
                  persuade himself that the man's intentions were not to incite rebellion. He could
                  not think, for a moment, that pious Parson Blake would sanction anything so
                  terrible in its consequences; and by this mode of reasoning, Horace managed to
                  sooth his conscience with regard to the pedler.</p>
               <p>On his return to the house, he met Uncle Peter in the yard. It was an unusual
                  circumstance for Horace to be out so late at night, and the old man looked up as
                  he passed, and shook his head ominously.</p>
               <p>The pedler took his departure soon after breakfast on the following morning, and
                  matters went on as usual during the day. At a late hour in the night, Peter called
                  Jack, wishing him to close the door and kindle a fire, as it had suddenly turned
                  quite cool—a frequent occurrence in the Southwest during midsummer. He received no
                  answer, and going to Jack's bed, found him absent. It was long past his usual hour
                  for retiring, and Uncle Peter hoped that he might be spending the night with some
                  of the other negroes. He could not help feeling uneasy, however; and after making
                  a fire, he drew up his low chair, seating himself comfortably to smoke the pipe
                  and think of Jack's waywardness.</p>
               <p>With the first peep of day, Uncle Peter was around the quarter in search of Jack;
                  but the negroes knew nothing as to the cause of his absence—though some of the
                  young men recollected his having said, the day before, that he was going to be
                  free. But as it was not the first time he had talked such nonsense, they supposed
                  him joking. When it was ascertained positively that Jack was nowhere to be found,
                  Major Wallace was informed of the fact. He was not inclined to<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000015"/> believe that he had run away, but supposed he had
                  gone out in the skiff to fish, and had been upset by the sudden squall that
                  occurred during night, and was probably drowned. The skiff was not at the landing;
                  but, after a diligent search, was found on the opposite side of the river, where
                  it had been left unfastened, but the wind blowing directly toward the shore had
                  prevented its floating off. When not in use, it was secured to the landing by lock
                  and chain. Jack kept the key, and it was evident that he had either used the skiff
                  himself or lent it to others. His best wearing apparel was also gone—so Major
                  Wallace was compelled to agree with Peter in thinking Jack wilfully absent.</p>
               <p>Peter felt confident that the pedler had something to do with Jack's
                  disappearance. The man had given him cause for suspicion a very short time after
                  stopping at Major Wallace's. It seems Peter was assisting him in removing his
                  books to a place of safety for the night, and while engaged, Jack came to him and
                  inquired for his master.</p>
               <p>"Is that your son?" said the pedler.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied Peter, "the only one I have."</p>
               <p>"He is a nice-looking fellow," said the pedler.</p>
               <p>"What a pity that he is a slave."</p>
               <p>"Dat boy is free enough," said Peter, sharply. "Go tend to your business, Jack,"
                  he continued, seeing that Jack had stopped to hear the conversation between
                  himself and the man. He afterward saw the pedler conversing with Jack in a
                  suspicious manner, when he thought himself unobserved, and he also knew them to
                  have been off together at a late hour in the night, perhaps for the purpose of
                  making arrangements for Jack's travels.</p>
               <p>"I went to tell you what I thought about dat pedler, master," said Peter, "but
                  your room was dark, and I reckoned you was asleep—den you laff at me so much for
                  watching Jack all de time, dat I felt mighty sheepish 'bout telling you, any
                  how."</p>
               <p>He mentioned the unusually late hour Horace was out on the road, and that he and
                  the pedler returned from the same direction, though not in company.</p>
               <p>Major Wallace was much surprised to find Uncle Peter disposed to suspect Horace,
                  and did not at that time give place in his mind to the idea. He spoke rather
                  tartly to Peter, and told him that he must be more guarded in connecting Mr.
                  Layton's name with unworthy transactions of any kind. He surely was at liberty to
                  go when and where he pleased. While Major Wallace was speaking, Horace entered the
                  room. He had not heard of Jack's disappearance. When told of it, he seemed
                  strangely moved, and made several hurried inquiries.</p>
               <p>"We suspect he has vamoosed with the pedler," said Major Wallace, laughing, "or
                  rather joined him at some appointed place."</p>
               <p>Horace turned deadly pale, and complaining of sudden illness, left the room.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of dat, Master?" said Peter.</p>
               <p>"Of what?" said the Major, feeling irritated, he scarcely knew why.</p>
               <p>"Of de way Master-Horace turned pale when you talked about de pedler."</p>
               <p>"Did you not hear him say that he was sick? I<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000016"/> wish you to bear in mind, Peter, the injunction
                  which I have laid upon you. Remember that Mr. Layton's wife is as dear to me as if
                  she were my own child. I cannot endure to hear her husband's name coupled with
                  that of the unprincipled wretch who has, it appears, taken advantage of my
                  hospitality."</p>
               <p>After Uncle Peter had retired, Major Wallace sat for some time, as if spell-bound
                  by the conviction that had forced itself upon his mind, of Horace Layton's guilt.
                  He asked himself the question repeatedly: Could it be Mary's husband who was an
                  accomplice of traitorous incendiaries? His evident agitation when hearing that
                  suspicion rested upon the pedler—the disposition he had manifested to educate
                  Jack—together with many other circumstances that now appeared suspicious—arose as
                  Horace Layton's accuser, and Major Wallace felt sorrowful indeed when he thought
                  of the many trials that he feared were in store for Mary and her children. From
                  this painful reverie he was aroused by the merry voices of the twins, who came
                  bounding to his side, and climbing upon his knees, twined their chubby arms about
                  his neck—each vying with the other in bestowing endearing names upon him. Tears
                  filled his eyes as he folded them closely to his bosom, and exclaimed, "Thank God,
                  darlings, your mother is noble and true."</p>
               <p>It is not often in the power of fallible human nature, to affix the just
                  proportion of guilt upon an individual whose character is laid open to suspicion.
                  When Major Wallace found that he had cause for suspecting Horace, he believed him
                  to be much more culpable than was really the case, and he felt himself placed in a
                  very trying situation—for, if Horace Layton entertained sentiments inimical to the
                  South, and was disposed to create dissatisfaction among the slaves, he did not
                  think himself justifiable in concealing the fact, and retaining him under his
                  roof. Yet, could he expose the husband of the orphan whom he had taken to his
                  heart as his own child? Could he be the first to point to the father of the happy
                  little innocents as a traitor? "No," said the kind-hearted, noble man, speaking
                  softly in reply to his anxious thoughts. He determined to speak to Horace upon the
                  subject, and awaken him, if possible, to a sense of the dishonorable and also
                  dangerous position in which he stood.</p>
               <p>Major Wallace was greatly relieved upon conversing with Horace, to find that he
                  was not associated with the pedler in his incendiary movements, and had not
                  abetted Jack's runaway notion. He confessed that the man had brought him abolition
                  papers and pamphlets from Northern acquaintances, who were anxious for him to
                  circulate them; but he had no intention of doing so. With regard to slavery, his
                  mind appeared completely bewildered. He seemed neither in favor nor opposed to the
                  Southern system. He acknowledged the condition of the slaves to be far superior to
                  that of the lower class in the North—yet was afraid there might be sinfulness in
                  the relative position of master and slave. In his interview with Horace, Major
                  Wallace treated him with kindness and consideration. He felt convinced that he had
                  not committed any intentional injury, and hoped eventually to induce him to take a
                  common-sense view of the subject in question.</p>

               <head>Chapter Seventh.</head>
               <p>JACK had been absent several months, and Major Wallace came to the conclusion that
                  some accident had befallen him, or that he had found his way North, when one day,
                  after dining, his usual time for reading, his attention was attracted by a notice
                  in the newspaper of a daring outrage committed in Natchez, a short time previous.
                  It appeared the mercantile establishment of "Rollins &amp; Co." had been entered
                  during the night by a set of robbers—a white man and several negroes. The thieves
                  helped themselves to a fine assortment of gentlemen's clothing, and were about
                  breaking into the money safe when discovered. They made a desperate resistance—all
                  of them being armed—and before they could be taken into custody, their captors
                  were compelled to fire upon them. One negro—a boy of about eighteen or twenty—was
                  supposed to be mortally wounded. He called himself Jack, and said that he belonged
                  to Major Wallace, of Point Coupee, and had been induced to leave his master by the
                  white man, who had promised to take him North and make a gentleman of him. The
                  other negroes had been seduced in the same way by the villain, who had been
                  engaged in peddling books through the country for some time past.</p>
               <p>Poor old Peter was distressed beyond measure when he heard of Jack's bad conduct.
                  He had hoped the boy would return voluntarily, and give his master no further
                  trouble. Major Wallace was disposed to make many excuses for him. He said the real
                  criminal was the unprincipled man who had led the boy astray. Uncle Peter,
                  however, was not so leniently disposed toward Jack, and seemed more disturbed by
                  his bad conduct than by the misfortune that had befallen him.</p>
               <p>"From de time dat Jack tuck to puttin' on airs, I hab talked to him, and tried to
                  get his sense back again," said Uncle Peter. "'Jack,' says I, 'if de Lord made you
                  a nigger from de fust, you will be a nigger to de last, now take my word for it,
                  and t'ain't no use for folks to try and undo what de Lord has done.'"</p>
               <p>"Well, Peter," said Major Wallace, "he is said to be mortally wounded. He may be,
                  at this time, dead. We must forgive him. I shall leave early in the morning for
                  Natchez, and wish you to accompany me. Perhaps matters may not be so bad as
                  described."</p>
               <p>The evening's mail brought Major Wallace a letter from the physician in attendance
                  upon Jack. He represented him as being severely injured, but not past hope of
                  recovery. Jack appeared truly penitent, and begged constantly to see his master
                  and his old father. In a postscript the physician added that it had been found
                  necessary to amputate one of Jack's arms.</p>
               <p>When Major Wallace first entered the room in which Jack lay, he could scarcely
                  believe the miserable, haggard, suffering object before him, the once
                  light-hearted and comely Jack. Old Peter wept bitterly at the sight of his
                  wretchedness; but commenced at once to lecture him upon the wickedness of his
                  conduct.</p>
               <p>"Hush, Peter," said Major Wallace, "do let the<pb n="34-35"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000018"/> poor fellow alone on that score; he has already
                  suffered terribly."</p>
               <p>"Dat I has, master," said poor Jack; "see here!" and he threw down the cover from
                  his shoulders and showed the short stump in place of his once brawny arm. Major
                  Wallace turned away from the sickening sight. Poor, maimed, misguided Jack! his
                  repentance was sincere. He could not bear for his master to be out of his sight
                  for a moment. With the superstition of the negro character, he verily believed the
                  pedler to be Satan himself.</p>
               <p>"Master," said Jack, "you jist ought to hear dat man talk. If de niggers was to do
                  what he wanted, dere would be no place in de next world bad enough for 'em. Oh! he
                  must be de devil sure; folks could not get to be so bad as he is. He tried to make
                  us believe de Lord would be mad if we didn't kill the white folks, and all de
                  worse doin's. I never did hear sich talk before."</p>
               <p>The pedler called himself Tower. He had letters in his possession from men in high
                  standing at the North—among the number, several clergymen and members of Congress.
                  It appeared that he was paid by the abolition party to go South on his unholy
                  errands. His Jersey wagon was found to have a false bottom, in which were secreted
                  fire-arms and ammunition, for arming the slaves that he succeeded in seducing from
                  their owners, and they were to rob and murder whenever a chance offered, as they
                  passed through the Southern States northward. The pedler was furnished with an
                  apartment in the penitentiary, and the fine stock of wearing apparel that he had
                  selected from Rollins &amp; Co. was returned to the rightful owners. The merchants
                  and slaveholders agreed upon a stoppage of legal proceedings, so far as the slaves
                  were concerned.</p>

               <head>Chapter Eighth.</head>
               <p>IS it not mournful to witness the breaking up of a once happy household? How sad
                  everything appears within the desolate mansion. No more does the cheerful fire
                  sparkle upon the hearth, and the family assemble around it in pleasant
                  conversation. No longer is heard the merry laugh of children, echoing through the
                  now deserted halls. The beautiful flower garden is neglected, and tall rank grass
                  waves in triumph where the exoties of many climes once bloomed in proud
                  distinction. All is sadly changed. Death has broken the chain, and scattered the
                  links of the loving home-circle.</p>
               <p>Major Wallace left home for New-Orleans. The steam packet on which he took passage
                  was loaded with cotton, which by some means unknown, took fire before the trip had
                  been more than half accomplished. The fire was discovered during the night, and
                  caused a complete panic; but by the strenuous efforts of the gentlemen passengers
                  and crew, was effectually extinguished. Major Wallace had been untiring in his
                  exertions, and feeling fatigued and overheated, sat down some time upon the deck,
                  in the cool night air. He took a severe cold, which speedily resulted in<pb
                     n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6177-00000019"/> pneumonia, and in spite of medical skill
                  and kind attention of friends, terminated fatally before his family could be
                  summoned to take a last farewell of the devoted father—the faithful friend—the
                  kind master—the true disciple of the Holy One, who proved his righteousness not by
                  "long prayers and disfiguring faces," but by justice, charity, and loving
                  kindness.</p>
               <p>Major Wallace was ill but three days, the speedy termination of his malady having
                  been caused by hmorrhage from the lungs.</p>
               <p>The morning was brilliantly clear, and the family of Major Wallace were in hourly
                  expectation of his return. Mary Layton and Annie had noticed the smoke that rose
                  from a steamboat above the trees on the opposite island. They hastened to the
                  levee, followed by the twins, and a troop of little negroes.</p>
               <p>"The boat will soon be around the point," said Annie, joyfully, "and I know papa
                  is on board!"</p>
               <p>Ere long the majestic steamer swept gracefully into view, and turned toward
                  "Wallace's Landing." In place of the usual quick stroke from the bell, a solemn
                  tolling struck dismay to the hearts of those who so anxiously expected the loved
                  one's return.</p>
               <p>"What can that mean, cousin?" said Annie, with quivering lip.</p>
               <p>Mary's cheek paled, and she drew Annie close to her heart.</p>
               <p>The negroes in the field heard the continued mournful tolling of the bell, and
                  quitting their work, hastened to the landing, in dread of sorrowful tidings.</p>
               <p>The boat came slowly to the shore, and the captain communicated the sad
                  intelligence—Major Wallace was on board, in his shroud and coffin.</p>
               <p>A wild shriek burst from Annie's lips, and she fell fainting in Mary's arms.</p>
               <p>Oh, there was no mockery of woe in the sorrowing train that followed the noble old
                  Southerner to his last home! There was no hypocrisy in the loud wail from the
                  grief-stricken slaves; and when at the close of the impressive burial service, an
                  appropriate hymn was sung, their voices blended harmoniously in chanting the last
                  sad tribute of respect to their beloved master.</p>

               <head>Chapter Ninth.</head>
               <p>THE only brother of Major Wallace, who lived in Florida, repaired immediately,
                  upon hearing of his brother's death, to take charge of his orphan niece. The
                  thought of leaving Mary, the children, and the dear old home, seemed too grievous
                  for the little girl to bear, and Mary was forced to suppress her own distress at
                  the separation, in order to persuade Annie to accede to her uncle's wishes. He
                  thought it best for her to reside in his own family, until her education was
                  completed, which would be in the course of five or six years. After that time, she
                  should be at liberty to select her own place of residence. Mary knew Annie's uncle
                  to be kind and gentlemanly, and she was confident no other course could be pursued
                  that would result so much to her advantage. Annie's large estate<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000020"/> was placed in the hands of a trusty agent, and with
                  a countenance almost as sad as her mourning raiment, sho left her old home.</p>
               <p>Some time previous to the death of Major Wallace, Horace Layton had given up
                  teaching school, with the expectation of going into other business; but after
                  hearing of his sister's death, he felt an unconquerable disposition to return
                  North. His old fanatical notions again took possession of him, when hearing of her
                  distress, even upon the bed of death, on his account; and he really believed it
                  would be impossible for him to live in the seducing South, and be a Christian. He
                  wrote to Parson Blake, informing him of his determination to return North with his
                  family, and stating that his wife's little fortune of six thousand dollars,
                  together with something he had saved from his salary in the last year or two,
                  would enable him to enter at once into some kind of lucrative business.</p>
               <p>"More than six thousand in possession," soliloquized the parson, after reading
                  Horace Layton's letter. "He must surely return immediately. This is the first time
                  the sly dog has let me know his wife had any property. Mrs. Layton is doubtless a
                  very amiable person; all the Southern ladies that I have seen seem to be so. She
                  can be of essential service to me in taking charge of my motherless children. It
                  is a very great expense for me to have their clothes made, and other attentions,
                  which I find myself compelled to bestow upon them, is really a great charge upon
                  me—quite incompatible with my small salary and clerical duties."</p>
               <p>The magnanimous parson felt as if some very good fortune had befallen him, and was
                  so extremely affable that he indulged in humming a lively air.</p>
               <p>And Mary left her sweet, sunshiny home, where she first drew the breath of life
                  and skipped in happy childhood over the daisy-covered meadows. She pressed back
                  the tears that welled to her beautiful eyes, as she gazed gloomily upon the spot
                  where her faithful friend, the guardian of her youth, lay mouldering. She looked
                  up for the last time at the grand old magnolias, that waved their lofty crests
                  toward her, as if in sad adieu; and gathering her children to her bosom, was ready
                  to say to Horace Layton, as did Ruth to Naomi—"Thy people shall be my people."</p>
               <p>O woman! brave, self-sacrificing woman! who has ever justly praised her worth?
                  When, true to her lovely nature, did she ever turn aside from the most arduous
                  duties, or weary of bestowing happiness upon the loved ones? And even should they
                  prove the serpent's tooth to her faithful bosom, the last gasp of life would be
                  spent in the guilty ones' behalf.</p>

               <head>Chapter Tenth.</head>
               <p>AH, Horace, my dear brother; I am delighted beyond measure to see you once more.
                  What beautiful children! and this very charming lady is your wife! truly, you are
                  a lucky fellow."</p>
               <p>Such was Parson Blake's greeting, as Horace Layton's family alighted from the
                  stage-coach at the door of his comfortable mansion. Mary had heard Horace<pb
                     n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6177-00000021"/> speak of his brother-in-law as a man of
                  exalted piety, and knowing that he had but a short time previously, lost his wife,
                  she had anticipated meeting with a very patriarchal and sorrowful looking
                  personage. When introduced to the sprucely dressed and butcher-like individual (it
                  is generally conceded that butchers are florid and fleshy), she could scarcely
                  credit the evidence of her senses, and felt an instinctive aversion to the man.
                  His face was red, full and sensual in expression; the lower jaw unnaturally heavy,
                  and a habit that he had of constantly smiling, was particularly disagreeable,
                  owing perhaps to the dull, lifeless expression of his eyes, which seemed totally
                  at variance with anything like real good nature. The parson had resolved that Mary
                  should entertain a high opinion of his worth, and was the most polite and
                  attentive of hosts. He was quite charmed with her grace and beauty, and felt
                  confident she would prove a most affable housekeeper. Parson Blake was a great
                  connoisseur in female beauty, and was strangely fascinated by the refinement and
                  elegance of the fair Southern lady. He never tired of listening to her sprightly
                  remarks, and in comparison with her society, the routine of his usual avocations
                  seemed dull and uninteresting—in short, the parson was nequivocally, and to a most
                  unchristian degree, in love with the wife of his dear brother-in-law. He was
                  disposed to be a model of courtesy. Mary had expressed her fondness for wild
                  flowers. The parson roamed through the woods in search of Flora's brightest gems,
                  notwithstanding the weight of fifty years, and an uncomfortable degree of obesity,
                  rendering a long walk for him a fatiguing performance. Mary was fond of music, and
                  sang well. The parson endeavored to recall several touching melodies he had known
                  in his youth; but here, too, age and his epicurean taste interfered materially
                  with his vocal organization, and the sounds that he wished to be winningly sweet,
                  assimilated very nearly to the unmusical notes of the swine tribe.</p>
               <p>To Mary Layton the parson was a perfect bore. She could not, however, forbear
                  being amused at his pretensions to youthful gallantry, but was disgusted by his
                  assumption of religion.</p>

            <div type="chapter">

               <p>MY brother Blake thinks it will be best for us to reside with him at present, and
                  not incur the expense of buying a farm, which arrangement will give me more
                  capital for entering into business."</p>
               <p>This remark was made by Horace Layton to his wife a few days after their arrival
                  at Parson Blake's. Mary was much disturbed as she listened to this proposal from
                  her husband; he had promised to purchase a neat cottage, and in anticipating the
                  arrangements for the comfort of her household, she had kept back the
                  heart-longings for her dear Southern home. She remained silent some moments,
                  wrapped in painful meditation.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of the proposed partnership, Mary?" said Horace.</p>
               <p>Mary's lips quivered, but she wiped the tears away home reminiscences had called
                  to her eyes, and placing her hand gently within that of her husband, she said:</p>
               <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6177-00000022"/>
               <p>"Horace, from the day that we first met, I have never dealt falsely with you,
                  neither shall I do so now. I am opposed to living in this house as a member of
                  Parson Blake's family. I detest the man, and can scarcely treat him with common
                  civility. You promised that we should have a home of our own; will you break your
                  word with me at the bidding of another?"</p>
               <p>"No, Mary, surely not, unless it be with your consent; but why do you dislike
                  Brother Blake? He treats you kindly, and I was under the impression that you
                  greatly esteemed the Christian character."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Mary, "for Christians such as my own father and dear, kind guardian
                  were, I entertain the deepest reverence; but, Horace, forgive me when I say, that
                  I have no faith in Parson Blake, and believe him to be a hypocrite. I had rather
                  die than live in the house with him for any great length of time. I should have
                  either to treat him with coldness or act deceitfully."</p>
               <p>It required all the courage that Horace could muster, to inform Parson Blake of
                  Mary's decision against his proposition of the joint establishment.</p>
               <p>"And what are Mrs. Layton's objections?" said the parson, as his face turned from
                  red to purple, with ill-concealed resentment—the idea of any one entertaining an
                  opinion contrary to his own, appeared to him the very height of temerity.</p>
               <p>"She thinks we will be happier and better enabled to educate our children
                  faithfully under our own roof," said Horace, mildly.</p>
               <p>"Ah, I see plainly how it is, Horace," replied the parson: "your pretty wife is
                  the master. Those Southerners are accustomed to ruling and having slaves, you
                  know. I suppose you are well trained by this time in giving up to her whims—ha,
                  ha! really, Brother Horace, I never expected to see a man of your independent
                  character so entirely subservient to the will of a woman." Parson Blake was well
                  aware that his language caused the sensitive nature of Horace Layton to suffer
                  keen anguish, but he affected to laugh, as if he was really amused to find him
                  placed in the unfortunate predicament of a submissive husband. "Well," he
                  continued, "we must look around and see what can be done. There is a small house
                  about a fourth of a mile from my farm, that may be purchased upon reasonable
                  terms. I will go at once and see the owner." As Parson Blake passed through the
                  portico, he observed Mary sitting near an open window. She held little Ellen in
                  her arms, and Charley stood at her side pointing to some object on the front lawn
                  that attracted his attention. The parson paused involuntarily to look upon the
                  beautiful group: and feelings of bitter hatred rankled in his heart as he gazed
                  upon the lovely woman, whom he was convinced understood his true nature all too
                  well for the completion of his designs.</p>

               <head>Chapter Twelfth.</head>
               <p>SO the cottage was purchased for a few hundred dollars; and Horace, acting upon
                  the suggestion of some secret misgivings for the future, had the title made to his
                  wife. Mary planted shrubs and vines, with wild flowers gathered from the wood,
                  around the yard. She wished to make the spot resemble, though it were but little,
                  her sunny Southern home. She was always cheerful, and in her devotion to her
                  husband and children, found happiness.</p>
               <p>Parson Blake was the proprietor of an abolition paper, and laid claim to Horace
                  Layton's time and attention forthwith. He was established as assistant editor, and
                  saw daily issued from that office false allegations against the South—statements
                  that he knew to be untrue, and though his conscience smote him for his treachery,
                  his will was as powerless against the influence of Parson Blake as would be a
                  feather in staying the course of the swiftly-running brook. His capital was
                  invested in the abolition press, with the certainty of a handsome yearly
                  increase—so said Parson Blake—but, alas! for Horace Layton's credulity and
                  confidence in his unworthy relative, his requests for necessary funds were
                  generally met by the payment of sums insufficient to defray family expenditures,
                  or short and indefinite answers.</p>
               <p>"Your wife must be very extravagant, Horace," said the parson, as he handed him a
                  ten-dollar bill. "Why, my dear brother, it is but a month since I gave you the
                  same amount of money you now receive. I assure you, twenty dollars would have
                  clothed your sister and her children for a whole year."</p>
               <p>"We have to pay for provision and servant-hire," replied Horace; "and I fully
                  expected a comfortable support for my family from the interest of my funds in your
                  possession."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Horace, you have imbibed extravagant notions of living during your sojourn in
                  the land of abominations. Now, what need is there for Mrs. Layton to have a
                  servant? Your sister did her own work—why cannot your wife do the same?"</p>
               <p>Why did you not tell Horace, Parson Blake, that his sister, your wife, had gone to
                  her grave from the effects of over-exertion?—that while your days were passed in
                  indolent luxury, or in brewing mischief, her life was one of unceasing toil?
                  Horace Layton well knew that his wife was neither extravagant nor indolent, and he
                  told the parson that Mary did the sewing for her family, instructed the children,
                  and attended to household affairs—he thought that was employment enough for one
                  lady.</p>
               <p>"There it is, you see, just what I have before told you," said the parson, patting
                  the dumpling index finger of his right hand coaxingly upon the cushion-like palm
                  of the left; "your idea is to maintain your family in luxurious indolence. Take my
                  advice, Horace, set them to work; don't be afraid that Mary will injure herself by
                  hard labor, it is not in her Southern nature to do so, and we must all be very
                  economical, for matters with our firm are not progressing so well as I had hoped.
                  The expenses are very heavy; payments<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6177-00000024"/>
                  backward, and friends falling off; yet by caution, and less expenditure, we may be
                  enabled to save ourselves. Ah! me, this world, this wicked world!" sighed the
                  parson, as he folded his arms in mock despondency over his rich velvet vest.</p>
               <p>Horace Layton returned home weary and disheartened. He always found Mary busily
                  employed. She ever met him with a sweet smile of welcome, and never complained of
                  wanting many comforts, to which she had been accustomed. Yet the seeds of discord
                  had been scattered by the unprincipled parson, to take root in the mind of weak
                  Horace, and he was prepared to be still more exacting of the noble being who had
                  sacrificed so much for his sake. Poor Mary was yet ignorant of Parson Blake's
                  having her little fortune in his possession, or that her husband was co-editor of
                  a nefarious journal—the object of which was to strike the death-blow to her
                  beloved land.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter Thirteenth.</head>
               <p>THE care of educating Charlie and Ellen devolved entirely upon their mother.
                  Horace Layton was seldom at home during the day, and when at night he returned to
                  his family, usually brought pamphlets to read, or was engaged in arranging
                  manuscripts for publication. Each day he appeared more absorbed by his employment,
                  and toward his family, the tender regard that he had formerly evinced, was
                  superseded by careless indifference. Thus passed Mary's life in her Northern home.
                  She had but few associates, never participated in amusement of any kind, and
                  scarcely indulged in necessary recreation. Her life was one of incessant toil, yet
                  she submitted uncomplainingly to the unhappy change of circumstances that had
                  befallen her. It was only when Mary learned that her husband had joined the
                  traitorous abolitionists, that she felt truly wretched and degraded—a settled
                  gloom overspread the sweet, sunshine face of unclouded days.</p>
               <p>For some time after leaving the South, Mary had corresponded regularly with Annie
                  Wallace, and other friends, but a change of postmasters in the village where she
                  resided, had placed the office in the keeping of Parson Blake's nephew, who was an
                  exact counterpart of his uncle in all unworthy transactions. From the period of
                  this exchange, Mary's letters to her Southern friends remained unanswered. She was
                  at a loss to account for their strange silence, and felt reluctant to believe that
                  the companions of her youth would cast her off, although her husband had assumed a
                  hostile position toward the South.</p>
               <p>The mystery was solved by accident. Charlie and Ellen usually carried their
                  father's dinner to the printing office, which adjoined the residence of Parson
                  Blake. Upon one occasion, they found him absent, and concluding that he was at
                  Parson Blake's, went there in search of him. The parson had just finished reading
                  a letter, and as they entered the room, he threw it in the fire; but the strong
                  current of air from the chimney caught up the open sheet safely from the burning
                  coals. When the children left the house on their return home, they found the
                  letter flying about<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6177-00000025"/> the yard at random,
                  and running in chase, soon secured it as a great prize.</p>
               <p>"Oh, this is a letter," said Ellen; "and here is a whole side that has no marks
                  upon it. Let us take it home, Charlie, you know mamma is going to teach us how to
                  write soon, and this paper will do for copies."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and the writing will do for mamma to read," replied Charlie; "it always
                  makes her look so glad to get letters," and the little innocents trudged homeward,
                  delighted at the idea of affording their loved mother pleasure. They had re-folded
                  the letter so that the direction appeared in its proper place.</p>
               <p>"See here, mamma, what we have for you," said Ellen, running forward, and holding
                  up the letter. Mary advanced with quickened pace to meet them, and a long absent
                  smile sprung to her lips as she recognized the writing of Annie Wallace; but when,
                  upon nearer inspection, she saw the letter was opened and much soiled, in a voice
                  of surprise, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"My children! how came you by this letter? and why is it open and so much
                  injured?"</p>
               <p>They told of finding it flying about the yard of Parson Blake.</p>
               <p>"Did your father see it?" inquired Mary, and she dreaded to hear their reply, for
                  she felt that if her husband would submit to her being treated so dishonorably,
                  even by Parson Blake, the slightest hope of returning confidence between them was
                  at an end.</p>
               <p>"No, mamma," said Charlie, "Uncle Blake told us that papa had gone into the
                  country, and would not return before night."</p>
               <p>"Mamma," said Ellen, "maybe I can tell how that letter came to be so full of
                  sootcmdash;I saw Uncle Blake throw one into the grate, but it flew up the chimney
                  before the fire caught it."</p>
               <p>"Very likely, my child, it is the same letter, and if it rightfully belonged to
                  him I should send you to return it."</p>
               <p>"Another drop of bitterness," sighed Mary. She at first thought of showing the
                  letter to Horace, as a proof of the unworthy character of the man by whom he was
                  so completely ensnared; but upon second consideration, thought it best to say
                  nothing of the matter, for she was certain the wily parson would find some
                  plausible way of overcoming the difficulty, and she would perhaps reap more injury
                  than benefit from the disclosure. It was a sad satisfaction for her to know that
                  her old friends were still faithful, although she was debarred from holding
                  further intercourse with them, and she determined that Parson Blake should never
                  have the opportunity of reading letters written by herself. She would make no
                  further attempt to correspond with the cherished friends of her youth, and as
                  Horace Layton was the avowed enemy of her native land, she deemed it the most
                  prudent course that she could pursue. In Annie's last letter to Mary, she
                  mentioned her approaching marriage with Mr. Sterling, whom she represented as
                  being in every way calculated to insure her happiness. Mary hoped that Annie's
                  attention would be so much engrossed by the new ties she would form, as to prevent
                  her from long grieving over the seeming neglect of the loved companion of her
                  childhood.</p>

               <p>IT was a subject of rejoicing to Mary that she was fully competent to educate her
                  children; for, otherwise, they would most probably have received but little care.
                  Horace Layton, at times, appeared fond of them, yet his general bearing toward his
                  family was, as though he feared that, by following the dictates of natural
                  affection, he was indulging in some forbidden pleasure. He seemed almost afraid to
                  converse with his wife. He was never harsh, but by coldness and neglect, inflicted
                  sorrow quite as poignant to her faithful bosom; but Mary saw plainly how
                  completely he was influenced by Parson Blake, and believed that, entirely removed
                  from his baneful control, her husband would be all that she wished him, and with
                  patient, loving kindness, hoped and trusted that the good time would yet come.</p>
               <p>Charlie and Ellen were both possessed of fine intellect. Ellen was quick,
                  imaginative, and affectionate. Charlie much resembled his sister in mental
                  qualifications, and was a courageous, manly little fellow. He idolized his mother
                  and sister, and they, in return, knew well how to prize the noble boy. Mary felt
                  that in her children she was blest. They were as bright stars illuminating the
                  dark clouds that had so unexpectedly gathered around her pathway.</p>

               <head>Chapter Fifteenth.</head>
               <p>"CHARLIE has not yet returned from the mill, Horace. Can you imagine what keeps
                  him so long?</p>
               <p>In the pale care-worn being who awaited Horace Layton's reply, one could scarcely
                  have recognized his beautiful and healthful wife, who, but seven years previously,
                  had left her luxurious Southern home to find neglect and hardship in the cold,
                  ungenial North.</p>
               <p>Horace Layton sat near the fire, engaged in writing, and seemed scarcely conscious
                  of having been addressed by any one. He turned partially around, and seeing his
                  wife standing near him, said: "Did you speak to me, Mary?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," she replied, "I told you that Charlie had not yet returned. It commenced
                  snowing soon after he left, and he is but poorly clad. I fear he has been overcome
                  by the cold."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I guess not," said Horace; "he has loitered on the way, or been unavoidably
                  detained. Surely a boy of ten years of age is old enough to take care of
                  himself.</p>
               <p>"Charlie is quite old enough to take care of himself under ordinary circumstances;
                  but to walk five miles to the mill and back, on such a day as this has been, is a
                  severe trial for the strength of any child," replied Mary.</p>
               <p>Horace said nothing more, and seemed to feel no solicitude on his child's account.
                  Mary returned to her<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6177-00000027"/> ironing; she was
                  certain that brave, faithful Charlie was not loitering. He had left home in the
                  morning, promising to return with all possible speed, for he knew that his mother
                  would suffer great anxiety if he was long absent, as the weather was intensely
                  cold. She was reluctant to have him go at all, but the family were without bread,
                  and there was no other alternative than for him to go to the mill for flour.</p>
               <p>Another hour passed, and Charlie was still absent. The clouds had rolled away,
                  leaving a clear sky; but the gloom of night was fast approaching. The snow had
                  fallen very heavily, and Mary's fears had increased every moment. She could endure
                  the torturing suspense no longer, and throwing her threadbare cloak around her
                  shoulders, went forth to seek the child. The road to the mill lay through a strip
                  of wood. She at first could scarcely make her way amid the snow, but anxiety for
                  Charlie braced every nerve. One side of the road sloped downward, forming a deep
                  valley. Mary thought it probable that he might have sought protection from the
                  snow storm in some niche—she stood upon the brow of the glen and called aloud,
                  "Charlie, Charlie!" The sound struck upon the hill-side, and was borne upon the
                  frosty air, sighing mournfully, "Charlie, Charlie!" till lost in the distance. She
                  again struggled onward, and stumbling against some object lying in the road, she
                  threw forward her hand to prevent falling. A soft lock of hair met her touch. Ah,
                  the mother well knew that silken tress, waving upon the snow, as if to mark the
                  spot where a young heart had ceased to beat. With frantic haste she scraped the
                  snow away, and the moon shone brightly on the face of dead Charlie.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my boy!" was the anguished cry that burst from the tortured soul of the poor
                  mother. She raised him from his snowy tomb, and folding him to her bosom, sat down
                  beneath the ice-covered trees, and pressing her lips to his frozen check, seemed
                  unconscious of the bitter cold, or the danger of her situation, exposed as she was
                  to the keen blasts and the drifting snow.</p>

               <p>HORACE remained, as Mary had left him, completely absorbed by his occupation. He
                  had a long list of Southern outrages to comment upon, that had been furnished by
                  the fertile brain of Parson Blake, and other unprincipled colleagues.</p>
               <p>The realities of Southern life, with which he had been for years acquainted, were
                  all forgotten, or suppressed by a base and false theory, emanating from the minds
                  of wicked men, to which he traitorously subscribed; and in consequence his
                  sympathies were all perverted.</p>
               <p>The fire had died out, and the appearance of the apartment was cheerless and
                  poverty-stricken. Little Ellen stood by the window anxiously awaiting her mother
                  and Charlie, but no welcome sound of returning footsteps fell upon her ear. She
                  shuddered as the cold blasts of wind passed over the cottage, and overcome by a
                  feeling of desolation, she burst into tears. Her sobs startled her father as if
                  from a dream; he rose hastily from his seat, and looking around with surprise,
                  said:</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6177-00000028"/>
               <p>"Where is your mother, Ellen?"</p>
               <p>"She has gone to look for Charlie," said the weeping child.</p>
               <p>"Why, how imprudent of Mary to go out on so cold a night. In what direction did
                  your mother expect to find Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"She went toward the mill," replied Ellen.</p>
               <p>He opened the door and looked forth. The keen air almost deprived him of
                  breath.</p>
               <p>"Kindle a fire," said he; "I will go out to meet your mother and Charlie."</p>
               <p>He walked rapidly, for nature had arisen before him with frowning brow, and his
                  conscience lashed him terribly. Like the drowning man, who is said to review the
                  whole course of life, in the few seconds of suffering that end his existence, so
                  in the short space of time that elapsed as Horace Layton roamed through the wood,
                  the varied scenes of his past life came in rapid succession to his recollection.
                  He thought of the joyous and blooming girl he had taken to his bosom, with the
                  promise to love and cherish. He remembered how unselfishly she had given up the
                  home and friends of her childhood for his sake. He seemed to hear again the first
                  feeble wail of the little beings that had bestowed upon him the proud title of
                  father, and he thought of Mary as she then was, patient and uncomplaining under
                  the trials he well knew she endured. His thoughts were interrupted by some object
                  near the roadside. He moved toward it.</p>
               <p>"Mary!" he exclaimed, "my wife, why are you here?"</p>
               <p>"See!" she replied, as she threw back her cloak, and Horace looked upon his dead
                  boy.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mary!" he exclaimed, in a voice of anguish, "he cannot be dead; there may yet
                  be hope; let me hasten home with him." He took Charlie in his arms, and Mary
                  followed. Ellen heard their returning foot steps, and met them at the door. One
                  glance at her mother's face, told the sad tale. It was well for Mary that, in
                  soothing Ellen's wild grief for the loss of her brother, she was enabled to
                  control her own agony to some extent. Charlie had been the staff of the household.
                  He was courageous and industrious, devoted to his mother and sister, and cheerful
                  in the discharge of his duties, by far too heavy for his childish years. How he
                  met his death could only be conjectured. The probability was, that being fatigued
                  with struggling through the snow, he had paused to rest, and fallen into the fatal
                  sleep that frequently overcomes persons suffering from intense cold.</p>

               <p>AT an early hour on the following morning, Parson Blake was with the afflicted
                  family. He found Horace suffering keenly from the mental warfare between nature
                  and fanaticism. Horace felt that he had been harsh and exacting with his
                  family—that he had been an unfaithful workman in his own vineyard; but Parson
                  Blake laughed at his consciousness, and insisted he was by far too lenient.
                  "Search the Scriptures, Horace," he said, pompously; "there you will<pb n="56-57"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000029"/> be instrncted to be rigid in your family
                  government. Had your son been more dutiful, he would not have been idling on the
                  road, which was very probably the case, at the time of his death, and—"</p>
               <p>"Stop, sir!" exclaimed Mary, as starting from her seat beside the dead boy, she
                  stood before the harsh hypocrite; "how dare you thus impiously slander an angel in
                  heaven. My husband," she continued, as kneeling before Horace, she clasped his
                  hands within her own, "will you—oh! will you forsake this wicked man? See how he
                  has dragged us down to poverty and wretchedness, by enslaving you, body and soul."
                  Oh! Horace, let us take Charlie back to the land where he first drew the breath of
                  life, and lay him beside that dear, kind friend, who so cherished us. Will you,
                  for Ellen's sake, return to our old Southern home? We may yet be happy there,
                  and—" Mary's voice ceased. She was overpowered by emotion, and fell at her
                  husband's feet, pale and insensible. So deathly did she seem, he thought the soul
                  had fled, but no, with a deep, sad sigh, it returned to suffer on.</p>
               <p>So beautiful Charlie was laid in that cold, cold clime, and his mother and Ellen
                  planted flowers around the little martyr's grave.</p>

               <head>Chapter Eighteenth.</head>
               <p>PARSON BLAKE had partaken of a hearty and very choice meal. The cheerful fire cast
                  a pleasant warmth throughout his comfortable apartment, yet he felt excessively
                  annoyed and irritated. He paced the room fretfully, and spoke in a low, quick tone
                  of voice, though no companion was present to listen to the recital of his
                  grievance.</p>
               <p>"Ha!" said he, "upon my word! did anybody ever hear of greater insolence? To think
                  of that woman's calling me a wicked man, is really quite monstrous. Oh! I detest
                  these Southerners, root and branch, and hope ere long to see the whole race
                  exterminated. Why, take my whole congregation separately and collectively, I am
                  confident that one, or all, would not presume to advance such an idea. Me wicked
                  indeed! I, a minister of the gospel, wicked!"</p>
               <p>Well, pray tell us what constitutes goodness, agreeably to Parson Blake's idea.
                  Does a disposition for murder, rapine, sedition in every unprincipled form? The
                  ruthless slaughter of innocent victims, or the traitorous wreck of a mighty
                  nation? Who are the "wolves in sheep's clothing" that have stolen into the fold
                  with the true flock, and are ready to sanction deeds of horror, which the
                  arch-fiend could scarcely rival? If this is righteousness—if those are the true
                  ministers of the gospel, then Parson Blake and the entire abolition party are
                  justified.</p>
               <p>Parson Blake was resolved to revenge himself upon<pb n="58-59"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000030"/> Mary Layton for the unvarnished opinion she had
                  presumed to express of his character. He knew well how to torture her proud,
                  upright nature, and he at once made arrangements for placing Horace in a position
                  that she would consider worse than death. He entered the printing office one
                  morning for the purpose of giving his victim a preparatory lecture. Horace sat
                  near the window, his head bowed down upon his folded arms. A little boy had just
                  passed whistling merrily, a favorite habit with Charlie. The unhappy father
                  thought of his bright-faced boy, and wept.</p>
               <p>"Why, Horace," said the parson, "you seem unusually downcast. Come, man," he
                  continued, patting him coaxingly upon the head, "be firm. I am quite ashamed of
                  your want of resignation. Really, you grieve over a mere casualty that has
                  befallen your family, as if there was no other suffering in the world. Think of
                  the poor groaning African; you are selfish in your grief, and censure yourself in
                  the wrong place. Oh! my poor brother, it is the godless wife to whom you are
                  fettered, that has so perverted your natural goodness of heart, and blinded you to
                  virtuous magnanimity. Up, man," said the parson theatrically, "throw off all
                  weakness, go forth and break the chains of suffering humanity. Put even your bible
                  into the fire, if it contains a single line favorable to slavery."<ref

               <p>THE hopes which Mrs. Layton had entertained, that her husband had been awakened to
                  a sense of duty to his family, by Charlie's untimely end, were of short duration.
                  He seemed more than ever infatuated by Parson Blake. When at home, the image of
                  the lost boy was ever present to his mind, and the conviction that, by his own
                  inattention to the wants of his family, the child's life had been sacrificed; but
                  Parson Blake soon induced the weak man to believe that he had been sinfully
                  indulgent to his family, and that he had become morbidly sensitive from having led
                  too sedentary a life.</p>
               <p>"Your sensibilities have become perverted by the narrow compass to which you have
                  confined your benevolence," said the <emph>philanthropic</emph> parson, "and I am
                  really shocked, Horace, to find that you so readily yield the opinions which I
                  have endeavored to instil into your mind for years, to the contracted and selfish
                  views of iniquitous persons. Come, come! I pray you, drop all the womanly weakness
                  of character, which renders you so unhappy, and let's to work in good
                  earnest."</p>
               <p>And Horace Layton followed the parson like a shadow. He was a constant attendant
                  at abolition meetings—not unfrequently gave touching exhortations in crowded
                  assemblies, in behalf of the colored portion of human nature, whose ideal
                  sufferings were as gigantic mountains compared with the more hill realities
                  endured by his wife and child at home. He was frequently absent<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000031"/> for many weeks at a time, and if he ever wrote to
                  Mary, his letters never reached her. At such times, she was often destitute of
                  funds, and could earn but a scanty subsistence by her needle, yet when Horace
                  Layton returned to his wife and child, he was received with affectionate
                  welcome.</p>
               <p>Little Charlie had not been dead quite a year, when Horace left home, in company
                  with Parson Blake, for New-York city. The distance was only twenty miles, and he
                  told his wife that he would not be long absent. A month elapsed, and he had not
                  returned. The parson came back without him and called by to tell Mrs. Layton that
                  her husband had gone South on business of great importance, and would be detained
                  for an indefinite length of time.</p>
               <p>"Horace wished to return and bid you farewell," said Parson Blake, "but I found
                  some trouble in inducing him to go, and was afraid that if he came back, he might
                  possibly be tempted to flee the path of duty that I had selected for
                  him—therefore, I insisted upon his departing at once, with the party who were all
                  ready.</p>
               <p>"For what purpose has he gone South?" inquired Mary.</p>
               <p>"To assist in liberating the groaning slaves," said he.</p>
               <p>"Poor, misguided man!" was Mary's exclamation, as tears fell from her eyes. "God
                  grant he may come to no harm." She left the room abruptly, not wishing that Parson
                  Blake should witness her wretchedness.</p>
               <p>"He has deserted his wife and child, and gone to seek a felon's death. Oh, Heaven
                  protect him!" was the cry that wailed from Mary, as she lay awake that long,
                  dismal night, and thought of her husband's treachery. It was many days before she
                  could recover the usual fortitude with which she met the unhappy fate which had
                  mercilessly encircled her. The wages that she received for her labor, were
                  insufficient for the support of Ellen and herself. She sometimes disposed of fancy
                  embroidery and exquisitely pencilled landscapes, but the sum which she received
                  for these rare gems of genius, was little more than sufficient to purchase the
                  materials for work.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter Twentieth.</head>
               <p>LITTLE Ellen thought of many plans for assisting her mother, but none proved
                  feasible, except for her to be hired out as a servant. She could then earn her own
                  support, and by doing so, lighten her mother's labor. The idea was humiliating
                  beyond measure to Mary, and at first, she could not endure to think of her lovely
                  child going into servitude: but she could find no other alternative, and concluded
                  that Ellen would have to brave the hard fate before her—for both mother and child
                  needed the common necessaries of life.</p>
               <p>The cottage belonged to Mary, and she thought of selling it for what little it
                  might bring, and returning South; but when she remembered that her husband was
                  abroad, as a traitor, in the land where she would seek an asylum, the idea was
                  abandoned as one fraught<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6177-00000032"/> with
                  mortification. It was only when she thought of Ellen that her resolution wavered.
                  She fervently prayed that when death had laid her to rest beside Charlie, her
                  unprotected child would be restored to the kind friends in her native land.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Layton forced herself to yield to Ellen's solicitation, and she went to live
                  with Mrs. Blunt—a person in good circumstances—as nurse for an infant. She was to
                  receive board and clothing for her services, and be allowed the privilege of
                  visiting her mother once a month. Mrs. Blunt protested that Ellen would have very
                  little work—she was merely needed as a plaything for the baby. Ellen found that
                  Mrs. Blunt's idea of "little work," amounted to the whole drudgery of the family.
                  She was called before day to make fires, and by constantly breaking up the hard
                  coal, her hands were painfully cut up and bruised. It was no unusual circumstance
                  for her to be awakened during the night, to quiet the fretful child, and if she
                  failed in her endeavors, was severely reprimanded.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Blunt was excessively annoyed by Ellen's beauty, and thought Mrs. Layton
                  extremely indiscreet to have trained her daughter so far above her station in
                  society. She predicted a terrible future for the lovely child, and as if to punish
                  her for the gifts which Nature had so lavishly bestowed, she imposed the most
                  arduous tasks upon her. Sometimes Ellen's eyes would fill with tears, when weary,
                  she could not rest, or when unjustly punished, to sate the invidious feelings of
                  Mrs. Blunt's coarse, red-haired daughter; but she bore the cruel treatment she
                  received heroically.</p>
               <p>"Mother shall never know what I suffer," she would whisper softly, when lying
                  awake upon her straw pallet in the garret, she thought over the toilsome day she
                  had passed. And Mary never knew what hardships noble little Ellen endured. She
                  ever met her mother with a smiling face, and when the blessed time came around, in
                  which she was to visit her own home, she bounded like a young fawn over the
                  two-mile space between the residence of Mrs. Blunt and her mother's cottage.</p>

               <p>THE only being in Mrs. Blunt's household who seemed to have the least compassion
                  on Ellen, was Margery, an old negro from Virginia, who, with her husband, had been
                  manumitted many years previously by their master. They had objected to going to
                  Liberia, and settled in the North. Margery's husband had been long dead. When able
                  to work, she managed to do tolerably well; but in sickness, experienced neglect
                  and deprivation. When she learned that little Ellen was from the South, her heart
                  warmed toward her. She loved everything that reminded her of the loved home of her
                  youth, and she often wept bitterly when comparing happy old times with the want
                  and toil of her Northern life.</p>
               <p>By the kindness of Margery, Ellen's arduous duties were often lightened; and
                  sometimes when the nights were bitter cold, she would go the garret, carrying some

                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000033"/> len comfortable, or have a scuttle of coal ready
                  for her when she came shivering to the cellar for fuel to kindle a fire in Mrs.
                  Blunt's room.</p>
               <p>Margery's own duties were manifold. She was cook, washer and ironer, gardener, and
                  daily carried milk for sale around the neighborhood. A tallow chandler near by was
                  an acquaintance of Margery's. He would occasionally give her candles that were not
                  saleable. These she treasured on Ellen's account, for at night, when the family
                  were all asleep, was the only time she could find to read or study, which she felt
                  to be a great deprivation. She was well advanced in many branches of education,
                  and Margery's valued gift of refuse candles, enabled her to indulge the passion
                  for acquiring knowledge that she inherited from her mother.</p>

               <p>"IF you please, Mrs. Blunt, I will scour the front door steps this morning; it's
                  dreadful cold for Miss Ellen to do it. She's mighty puny, anyhow." This was
                  Margery's appeal to Mrs. Blunt, in Ellen's behalf. The day was piercingly cold,
                  yet the poor child had been ordered out in the freezing blasts to scour the
                  steps.</p>
               <p>"I wish you to attend to your own business!" was Mrs. Blunt's reply, "and let
                  Ellen take care to do the same. You will also, at once, drop the 'Miss' before
                  that girl's name. She is already spoiled enough, without any additional fancies
                  that you may feel disposed to put into her head. 'Miss Ellen,' indeed! a pretty
                  way to be addressing a servant in my house."</p>
               <p>"Well, madam, don't get mad," said Margery, somewhat tartly; "I was always used to
                  speaking in that way to the little ladies in my own country, and I think a heap of
                  that child,' cause she came from the South, and is so good and genteel."</p>
               <p>"I should suppose the very sight of a Southerner would be hateful to you. Have you
                  forgotten how dreadfully they treat poor negroes?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, laws-a-massy," said Margery, quickly, "don't talk to me about the way black
                  folks is treated down South. I was born and raised in Old Virginny—lived there
                  till over twenty, and never knowed what trouble was afore I cum here. Say what you
                  please about it, I'd go back this minute if I had a chance, and be sure of a good
                  home as long as I lived."</p>
               <p>Margery left the room, wiping away the tears that thoughts of her old home always
                  brought to her eyes. Ellen had the steps to scour. Her little hands were soon
                  stiff from cold, and so painful that she could not refrain from weeping; but she
                  did not pause until the work was finished. As she returned into the house with the
                  pail of suds, Mrs. Blunt met her, and in a surprised tone of voice inquired the
                  cause of her distress.</p>
               <p>"My hands ache so very badly," replied Ellen—"see how they are swollen."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes," said Mrs. Blunt, angrily, "I suppose Margery has led you to believe
                  yourself a delicate young<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6177-00000034"/> lady; but I'll
                  get the notion out of your head. Take that, cry-baby." She struck Ellen a heavy
                  blow, which sent her reeling across the hall. Margery saw the blow given.</p>
               <p>"That's the way a poor child is treated here," she exclaimed; "but you won't see
                  little niggers beat in Old Virginny for crying about frozen hands."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Blunt followed Ellen, apparently with the intention of repeating the blows,
                  or scolding her severely. The child stood in trembling submission—her soft blue
                  eyes raised meekly to the frowning countenance of the hard-hearted woman; but, for
                  once, the harsh language that rose to Mrs. Blunt's lips, died unuttered, and
                  something of a remorseful feeling came upon her, as she met the angel-like
                  expression of Ellen's face. She left the spot, and for some time after, treated
                  her rather more humanely.</p>

               <p>POOR, lonely Mary! No kind, sympathizing friend had she. Deserted by the husband,
                  for whose sake she had endured so much; separated from Ellen—not one loved object
                  near, save the spot where the drooping willows waved over lost Charlie. Wearily
                  indeed passed the hours for her. How often would her thoughts turn to the
                  unclouded days of youth! The unhappy lot that had overtaken her, far away from the
                  land of her birth, seemed as some terrible dream from which she would never
                  awaken; and upon the hidden future she scarcely dared allow her thoughts to
                  dwell.</p>
               <p>Horace had been absent for months, yet she had received no tidings of him. The
                  startling thought, that he had met with the traitor's doom, sometimes presented
                  itself to her excited imagination, and she would clasp her thin hands, in mute
                  despair, as if awaiting the dreaded confirmation of her gloomy forebodings.</p>
               <p>She was convinced that Ellen lead a wearisome life beneath Mrs. Blunt's roof, yet
                  what could she do toward bettering the condition of her suffering child? She could
                  furnish her with neither food nor raiment. The only prospect of relief was for her
                  to sell the cottage, and remove to some more friendly neighborhood, where she
                  might be enabled to earn a maintenance. Mary resolved to make the attempt, after
                  the time that Ellen was engaged to remain with Mrs. Blunt had expired.</p>

               <p>MARY sat alone in the cottage porch, busily engaged in sewing. The flowers that
                  many years previously had been planted by herself and the twins, were in bloom,
                  and a soft, Southern breeze wafted their delicate odor around her. Insensibly a
                  feeling of peaceful resignation calmed her troubled mind. Hope whispered, "All may
                  yet be well," when unexpectedly Parson Blake made his appearance, and Mary's
                  gloomy anticipations returned. It was the first<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000035"/> time he had visited her since he called to announce
                  the unwelcome intelligence that Horace had gone South on an iniquitous
                  embassy.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mrs. Layton, how are you to-day? I really hope that I find your health very
                     <emph>stout,</emph> for I have unhappy tidings to communicate."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to say that your presence here is always connected with unhappy
                  tidings," replied Mary.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, madam," said the parson; "but that is my misfortune, and not my fault. I
                  feel it my duty to communicate the intelligence, which comes into my possession,
                  supposing that your anxiety must be necessarily very great on your absent
                  husband's account. Let me see, how long is it since Horace left home?" He affected
                  to count the time, in a low voice, and answered his own query, by saying:
                  "Twenty-two months. Pray, madam, how often has he written to you in that
                  time?"</p>
               <p>"If at all, sir, you are perfectly aware 'how often' and also of the fact that his
                  letters have not been received by me." As Mary spoke, she looked with calm
                  severity upon the smirking countenance of the wicked man. His eyes fell beneath
                  her gaze; but he sighed heavily, as he said:</p>
               <p>"Be that as it may, madam, this is no time to settle the matter; a more solemn
                  occurrence must claim your attention. It is my painful duty to inform you that
                  Horace is dead—absolutely hung as a common felon!"</p>
               <p>For a moment the blood seemed to congeal in Mary's veins. She gasped for the
                  breath of life. Parson Blake was satisfied that she suffered almost beyond
                  endurance, and a fiendish smile dwelt upon his lips, as he detailed the
                  circumstances of the tragedy.</p>
               <p>"I find it stated in the papers," said he, "that a servile insurrection has been
                  attempted in the South. The ringleaders were white men. I am certain, from the
                  description of one man, that he was no other person than Horace Layton, though he
                  refused to disclose his real name. The other men were not so particular, and I
                  recognized them by name as the men with whom I know Horace to have been
                  associated."Parson Blake paused a moment to watch the effect of his
                  communication—then continued; "I presume, madam, it will in no degree lighten your
                  unhappiness to know that Horace met his death—that of a common felon—at the hands
                  of your own countrymen?"</p>
               <p>"No," replied Mary, with forced calmness, "it does not in the least assuage my
                  grief, to know that my own countrymen pronounced the doom of a traitor upon him;
                  but they stand justified by the iniquitous position in which my husband was
                  placed. If his intention was to incite rebellion and murder, it was the right of
                  those endangered to defend themselves. My countrymen are not guilty. At your door
                  lies the death of Horace Layton—by you he was led on in evil for years, against
                  his own inclinations; by you was he induced to forsake his family and seek a
                  dishonorable grave. Oh, treacherous man! remember there is an avenging God—fear
                  his wrath, for you will surely meet with your reward."</p>
               <p>A sudden and unusual feeling of dread came over Parson Blake, as he looked upon
                  the noble being whom he had so relentlessly persecuted. A voice,<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000036"/> too, seemed to cry from the grave for vengeance.
                  Oppressed by the gnawings of a guilty conscience, he turned hastily from the spot,
                  and Mary was alone with her great sorrow.</p>

               <head>Chapter Twenty-fifth.</head>
               <p>IT was some consolation to Mary that her husband's name had not been published to
                  the world as a traitorous incendiary. After the first shock was over, she could
                  think with some degree of composure upon the terrible realization of her worst
                  fears. She considered Horace Layton to have been a monomaniac, and Parson Blake
                  the author of every woe that had befallen the poor betrayed man.</p>
               <p>She shrank from telling Ellen of the dreadful tidings communicated by Parson
                  Blake, and trusted the dear child would never know the sad fate of her father.
                  Mary hoped, in some place where they were unknown, to earn a livelihood, and carry
                  the unhappy secret with her to the grave.</p>
               <p>In the neighborhood where Mary resided, there were many persons in competent
                  circumstances, but they held no communication with her. This cruel neglect was
                  attributable principally to the malicious report of Parson Blake. He represented
                  her to be extravagant, indolent, and altogether an ungodly person. Poor Horace, he
                  said, had been forced to flee from a companion so uncongenial. The most worthy of
                  the community munity employed her as a seamstress. She sewed with neatness and
                  despatch, for a mere pittance, scarcely sufficient to keep body and soul together;
                  yet these persons considered themselves benevolent, in an extraordinary
                  degree.</p>
               <p>Pure-hearted, gentle, long-suffering Mary, was looked upon as the plague-spot of
                  that neighborhood. Her Southern origin was an unpardonable sin in the estimation
                  of the fanatics, who formed the largest portion of the community. How glorious she
                  appeared, amid all her poverty, in the spotless rectitude of her truly Christian
                  character, compared with the Pharisaical creatures among whom she dwelt.</p>
               <p>From the commencement of Mary's Northern life, she had been deprived of all social
                  enjoyment. Blessed indeed was it that she possessed unfailing resources in the
                  superior mental gifts with which she was endowed.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter Twenty-sixth.</head>
               <p>THE term of Ellen's engagement with Mrs. Blunt was fast drawing to a close. Two
                  months more and she would be released. Mary told Ellen of her determination to
                  remove from the spot where, for them, so much misery had been concentrated.</p>
               <p>"Oh, mother, I am so very glad," was Ellen's exclamation, when she learned her
                  mother's determination, and her eyes sparkled brightly. "We can do much better
                  anywhere else, I dare say;" but a shade<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6177-00000037"/>
                  came over her face, as she said: "Yet, mother, how can we leave Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"We shall not leave him, darling. Charlie dwells with the blessed, in the land of
                  immortal youth, where no sorrow can ever reach him, or time dim the brightness of
                  his beauty. The little grave, so sacred to us for the mortal remains that moulder
                  there, will be ever dear, and though we may find a distant home, his pure spirit
                  can visit us upon the wings of undying love."</p>
               <p>Ellen covered her face, and wept. Her affection for Charlie would never grow cold.
                  He was ever present to her mind, as the fair and lovely boy with whom she had,
                  hand in hand, gone through the happy years of infancy; and often, when she thought
                  of her mother's lonely, deserted situation, she would exclaim: "Oh, if Charlie
                  were with her, she would not be so unhappy." Mary felt thankful that Ellen was yet
                  ignorant of her father's unhappy fate. She had never been reconciled to the loss
                  of her brother, and her sensitive, affectionate nature could scarcely have brooked
                  a calamity that was even more intensely grievous. Ellen wiped the tears from her
                  cheeks, that thoughts of Charlie had brought in flowing streams from her eyes. She
                  would no longer indulge in grief, and thus add to her mother's sorrow. Seated at
                  Mary's feet, upon a low stool, she appeared for some time to be thinking intently.
                  Suddenly, in a tremulous voice, she said:</p>
               <p>"Mother, where can father be?"</p>
               <p>The paleness of death overspread Mary's countenance. She looked mournfully upon
                  the sweet face, raised in loving expectation of a reply. A deep sigh escaped her
                  lips. She could give no other answer—but taking Ellen's hand gently within her
                  own, she said:</p>
               <p>"The sun has set, darling, and you have a long walk before you. I will go part of
                  the way to Mrs. Blunt's with you."</p>
               <p>Ellen was too observing not to know that she had caused her mother keen suffering
                  by inquiring for her father, and she saw that, for some reason, the subject was
                  intentionally waived. The day had been very sultry, but closed pleasantly. A cool
                  breeze was abroad, and the green leaves rustled merrily upon the swinging limbs,
                  as if rejoicing in its reviving freshness.</p>
               <p>The road from Mary's cottage to Mrs. Blunt's lay through a strip of wood. The
                  brambles were covered with berries temptingly ripe.</p>
               <p>"Now, mamma," said Ellen, "I must tarry awhile to pick a nice meal for you. Only
                  see what fine blackberries."</p>
               <p>They sat down upon a grassy bank, and Ellen partook of the berries, but poor Mary
                  was too heartsick to have the least appetite, even for the delicious fruit.
                  Ellen's artless inquiry for her father seemed still to sound on her ear. She was
                  fearful the dreadful secret would come to the child's knowledge, and send her
                  broken-hearted to lie beside Charlie in the little willow wood.</p>
               <p>Mary walked slowly in returning home. She felt weary and wretched. Within the
                  cottage all seemed so desolate. She sat in the porch, and looked upon the
                  unfolding beauties of the night. As if by magic, groups of brilliant stars, in
                  strangely picturesque figures, appeared throughout the boundless sky, and the
                  bright moon, in silvery raiment, rolled on with regal splendor, amid the countless
                  multitude. A solemn stillness reigned, broken only by the soft sighing of the
                     evening<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6177-00000038"/> breeze, or the pleasant
                  monotonous chant of the insect choir. The toiling hours of man were o'er, and his
                  weary senses hushed to rest. Mary sat for several hours in dreamy reverie.
                  Suddenly she was startled by the sound of approaching footsteps. The idea that
                  Parson Blake was again the bearer of evil tidings presented itself to her mind.
                  She rose with the intention of entering the house, but the man had reached the
                  porch steps, and she discovered him to be too tall and slender for Parson Blake.
                  She paused upon the threshold of the front door. In the next moment she was folded
                  to the arms of Horace Layton.</p>

               <p>GENEROUS, forgiving Mary, forgot all the cruel neglect she had endured—her blasted
                  hopes and betrayed affection. With tender compassion she looked upon the wreck
                  before her—the wasted form and death-stricken face of her misguided husband. The
                  sunken cheek and hectic cough told that Horace was far gone in consumption.</p>
               <p>"I have returned, Mary, to crave your forgiveness before I die, for the neglect of
                  all my most sacred duties—the care of my family."</p>
               <p>"Do not speak of leaving me forever, Horace, just as you have returned to gladden
                  my heart with the certainty of your existence, while I was suffering more than I
                  can express, from the conviction that you had died ignominiously.' She mentioned
                  the distressful intelligence communicated by Parson Blake, and said:</p>
               <p>"Surely he could not be so very malicious as to fabricate anything as terrible,
                  for the express purpose of torturing me—though, I must say, Horace, that my
                  opinion of Parson Blake has not changed for the better."</p>
               <p>"And I am confident that he has not given you any cause to think better of him;
                  however, he may have believed, as he said, that I had been executed with the
                  incendiaries mentioned in the paper; and I have no idea that he was in the least
                  distressed by the supposed occurrence. Blessed indeed, would it have been for us,
                  my wife, could I have thrown off his Satanic influence years ago. Now I know the
                  man, but it is after he has wrecked my hopes of earthly happiness. I am on the
                  borders of the grave. Sorrow has cast its blighting weight upon my brave wife; and
                  Ellen abroad with the hard-hearted! Ah, Mary, if I had listened to your warning
                  voice, this wretchedness might have been avoided."</p>
               <p>"It is useless to grieve over what we now cannot help. You were infatuated,
                  Horace, and thought yourself pursuing the right course. I can make every allowance
                  for you, but none for Parson Blake. You were deceived, but he was treacherous and
                  malicious. Pray tell me in what way you became aware of his true character?"</p>
               <p>"It may sound strangely, Mary, for you to hear me say, I always disliked Parson
                  Blake. I was enthralled by him, and thought him truly a Christian until very
                  lately; but I was never happy in his society. Like a bird charmed by the snake, I
                  could not avoid him, and was so weak as to fancy this feeling of dislike, over<pb
                     n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6177-00000039"/> which I had no control, to proceed from
                  some evil tendency in my own nature, and this idea rendered me the more abjectedly
                  devoted to him. When we lost Charlie, I was wretched from an accusing conscience.
                  I felt that the noble little fellow had fallen a sacrifice to my neglected duties;
                  and I trace the first awakening of my slumbering nature to that misfortune. It was
                  a relief to me to hear Parson Blake exonerate me from all shadow of blame, and I
                  readily adopted his professed opinion that I was morbidly sensitive, and that an
                  active life would dispel the illusion. With this hope, I followed him to all
                  abolition assemblies, &amp;c.—in my selfishness forgetting your sorrow and
                  comfortless condition; yet my trip to the South was unexpected. I had no idea,
                  when I left home for New-York, otherwise than I should return, as I told you, in a
                  few days; but, through the persuasion of Parson Blake, joined a party of
                  incendiaries, on the eve of starting South. I believed the mission a righteous one
                  at that time, and really, when I look back upon my past life, I feel that I must
                  have been insane. My business South was to peddle books, incendiary papers,
                  &amp;c., and to preach rebellion to the negroes whenever I could find an
                  opportunity; but, thank Heaven, my eyes were opened to the wickedness and folly of
                  the course, before I had committed any great amount of evil. I wrote to you at the
                  time of my first illness, telling of the change in my views. Why did you not
                  answer those letters, Mary? I do not blame you though, for surely you patience had
                  been sorely tried by unkindness and insult."</p>
               <p>"I never received a line from you, Horace, from the time you left home for
                  New-York. On his return home, Parson Blake called by, and told of your having
                  left, as he said, for an indefinite period."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible that he is so utterly unprincipled? I wrote by him from New-York,
                  and sent what funds I could spare, and I wrote frequently during my absence. Not
                  receiving any answer, I feared that you had cast me off, as I had deserved."</p>
               <p>"It is not the only time that Parson Blake has acted so dishonorably toward me. He
                  intercepted my correspondence with Annie Wallace and other friends. I found it out
                  by accident, and, of course, have never attempted to correspond with them
                  since."</p>
               <p>"Why did you not tell me at the time you discovered his unprincipled conduct.
                  Mary?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Horace, you were so completely blinded to his true character, that I did not
                  think for a moment you would credit the charge against him."</p>
               <p>Horace sighed—"Perhaps not, and your want of confidence in me was deserved
                  punishment. Oh, wife, would to Heaven that I might be spared to make some
                  reparation to you for my treachery."</p>
               <p>"I trust you are not so low in health as you fear, my husband. Ellen and I will
                  nurse you very tenderly; you will soon feel stronger. Dear child, how rejoiced she
                  will be to see you. Do not speak now upon subjects that so much agitate you. Let
                  me see if I cannot find something refreshing—oh, yes, here are some nice berries
                  that Ellen picked for me, as we walked this evening toward her home; but I was
                  thinking sadly of you, Horace, and had no wish to partake of them; now we will
                  make a feast together."</p>
               <p>Horace was overcome by fatigue. He had walked a<pb n="78-79"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000040"/> mile from the railroad to his home, and in his low
                  state of health, it proved exhausting; but Mary's soothing voice lulled him to
                  repose. He was soon wrapped in refreshing slumber. How sudden had been the
                  transition from hopeless despondency to rejoicing in the living presence of her
                  husband! Mary could scarcely credit the reality of the change; she was spell-bound
                  or dreaming. No, no! Horace was by her side; her arms were clasped around his
                  neck, and his head was pillowed upon her faithful bosom.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter Twenth-eighth.</head>
               <p>MARY wished Mrs. Blunt to relinquish her claim upon Ellen for the expiration of
                  the term for which she was engaged, but her petition was not granted. Ellen was
                  permitted, however, to pay her father a short visit. Horace found that two years
                  had changed her appearance materially; for though her young life had been shaded
                  by sorrow before he left home, she was then ever near her mother, and the charm of
                  her society kept the bright smile of childhood fresh upon Ellen's lip; but the
                  weary, delving life she led at Mrs. Blunt's, had chased the light of happiness
                  from her eyes—they were sad and thoughtful in expression, far beyond her years.
                  Horace gazed sorrowfully upon the little thin face—he pressed her again and again
                  to his heart, and blessed her for the likeness she bore to her mother.</p>
               <p>Horace brought a small supply of funds home—sufficient to add a few comforts to
                  the needy cot. He was prostrated for several days, but gradually gained his usual
                  strength. If Parson Blake had heard of his return home, he took no notice of it;
                  probably he had no farther use for him. One pleasant evening, about a week after
                  Horace's return, he strolled with Mary a short distance from the house. They sat
                  upon a grassy bank, and were planning some future arrangements, when Parson Blake
                  appeared a short distance from them. He had been to visit a neighbor, and was
                  compelled to pass near them in returning home. As he advanced, his countenance
                  assumed an expression of utter astonishment, and he paused before Horace,
                  exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"Do my eyes deceive me, or can this be some one strangely like Horace Layton?"</p>
               <p>"It is the very man you were in hopes had been strung to a gibbet, as a traitor,"
                  said Horace.</p>
               <p>"Now I know that I am deceived, for my own Horace would never have spoken to me so
                  disrespectfully."</p>
               <p>"You may be laboring under some delusion, Parson Blake, but I am not now, thank
                  Heaven! I am undeceived, and <emph>your Horace</emph> no longer."</p>
               <p>"Ah, my dear brother, I am in great distress concerning your evident falling away
                  from righteousness, and—"</p>
               <p>"Pray, sir, will you inform me what you did with the letter containing money that
                  I intrusted to your care, for my wife, at the time I went South? and also let me
                  know why she did not receive the letters written at different times during my
                  absence?" Horace spoke in a firm, decided tone. The parson was astonished, but not
                  at all embarrassed.</p>
               <p>"Why," said he, "you really do not suppose that I<pb n="80-81"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000041"/> can remember trifling circumstances, that have long
                  passed, when my mind is so much occupied by matters of vast importance?"</p>
               <p>"No," Horace replied, "I do not expect you to act with justice or honor to me and
                  mine; it will be best for us to remain, hereafter, as total strangers."</p>
               <p>The parson turned off with an indignant countenance.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid, Horance," said Mary, "you have caused Parson Blake to feel
                  resentment, that will lead to his doing us still greater evil."</p>
               <p>"There is but a small field of action left for his vengeance. He has robbed us of
                  health, happiness, and worldly estate. Perhaps I may be too severe—it is not my
                  nature to be so—but when I look back upon my misspent life, and remember how, step
                  by step, he has led me on to ruin, then cast me off to die an ignominious death,
                  or to meet with any other fate that would relieve him of my presence, and torture
                  my innocent family, I cannot view him in any other light than as a fiend
                  incarnate. But I have not yet told you how I became acquainted with his true
                  character; come, let us go home, and I will give you the history of my awakening
                  to some degree of common sense."</p>
               <p>"You are weary now," said Mary, when they reached the house; "wait, Horace, until
                  you feel stronger. Talking so much, must fatigue you."</p>
               <p>"No, I find it a relief to tell my pent-up wretchedness, for I have suffered
                  keenly, Mary, but I deserved it all, while you and our children were innocent, and
                  the victims of my treachery—and I have not even the power to make reparation!"
                  Horace sat for some moments buried in painful meditation, then continued:</p>
               <p>"I left New-York in company with seven men, for the South. Several were
                  clock-pedlers—the balance, like myself, book venders, and all were well supplied
                  with incendiary documents, etc. They were strangers to me, and not at all
                  prepossessing. We separated in Virginia. I made my way into North Carolina, and
                  soon disposed of my books and dispersed the abolition documents, wherever I found
                  an opening. I entered a mercantile establishment as clerk, receiving a good
                  salary, and giving satisfaction to my employers; but the circulating of incendiary
                  pamphlets had been traced to me, and I was requested to leave the place. My next
                  trip was to Georgia. I obtained a situation as teacher of a country school. I had
                  become weary of the negro subject, for the longer I remained with them in the
                  South, the more firmly was I convinced of their superior condition to the free
                  blacks of the North. I was pleasantly situated, boarding in a pious and
                  wellordered family, and should have felt comparatively happy, had I received
                  answers from you to my letters. Parson Blake corresponded with me regularly, and
                  through him I learned that you were well and cheerful. He intimated that you
                  refused to hold any correspondence with me, though you were ready to accept
                  supplies for your own and Ellen's necessaries. I sent all that I could spare, and
                  now know that you were defrauded of both money and letters by him.</p>
               <p>"The school-house in which I taught was used as a church. We had preaching every
                  other Sunday—for<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6177-00000042"/> white persons in the
                  morning, and negroes in the afternoon. Our regular minister was an excellent man,
                  and highly qualified to fill the station. He was a slave-holder—a consistent,
                  firm, yet lenient master, and was as careful, if not more so, in expounding the
                  Scriptures to the negro, as to the white man. I never met with a more intelligent
                  gentleman, a purer or more perfect Christian character. He frequently conversed
                  with me upon the slavery question, and his honest, common-sense views, acted like
                  a charm in dispelling the fanatical opinions that had led me, like some demented
                  creature, seeking amid comfort and content for horrors, that existed only in the
                  depraved imagination of the mischief-maker.</p>
               <p>"It sometimes happened that travelling lecturers, or other itinerant personages,
                  would give an evening's entertainment at the school-house. I had been several
                  months in charge of the school, when we were notified that a man, said to be a
                  world-renowned genius, would astonish the community by a display of his scientific
                  attainments. The school-house was in requisition for the evening, and at an early
                  hour, a considerable assemblage were ready to be astonished. I was late in
                  attending, and you may well imagine my surprise when, in the celebrated A. M., I
                  discovered one of my incendiary companions, a clock-mender. He recognized me at
                  once, and paused in his discourse, evidently to command an involuntary disposition
                  to laugh. His lecture proved a failure; like many other Northerners, he had
                  expected to find the inhabitants of Southern villages a complete set of
                  ignoramuses. Many of his attempts to elucidate abstruse questions, were truly
                  laughable; and the entertainment ended in quite a farcical manner, by eliciting
                  considerable merriment from the learned portion of the audience. He did not
                  attempt another display of his ignorance, but remained in the neighborhood for
                  several days—I supposed for the purpose of tampering with the slaves, and I
                  avoided him; but one night he called upon me, requesting an interview. I
                  reluctantly consented, and we walked from the house some distance to a retired
                  spot.</p>
               <p>"'Let us sit here, and talk awhile,' said he; 'I am anxious to know how you liked
                  my lecture the other night.' He laughed heartily, and I could not forbear joining
                  in his merriment, at the recollection of his ridiculous attempts, but replied:</p>
               <p>"'I am very certain that you did not succeed to the extent of your wishes, in the
                  literary department.'</p>
               <p>"'No,' he replied, 'I have failed in all my attempts to impose upon an intelligent
                  and excellent people. I expected to find the Southerners a degraded, ignorant set
                  of tyrants; but I find myself mistaken in every particular. They are noble and
                  generous. I was never so well treated in all my life, and I have repaid this
                  kindness by ingratitude and imposition—but I am resolved to act the villain no
                  longer. I am a good carpenter, and can make a handsome support anywhere
                  hereabouts. I shall have nothing more to do with the abolitionists, that's
                  certain; and I must say, that I believe you would do the same, if you knew as much
                  about them as I do.'</p>
               <p>"'I have already made the same resolution that you have,' said I; 'for I am
                  heartily tired of the subject, and I know that those persons who think the
                     slave<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6177-00000043"/> population in the South in an
                  unhappy condition, are mistaken. I often wish that Brother Blake would visit the
                  South, and take an impartial view of the matter. He is so very much disturbed by
                  the slavery question.'</p>
               <p>"'Mr. Layton,' said my companion, 'you are the most deceived man in the world, if
                  you think Parson Blake influenced by any other motive than self-intereset, in his
                  hue and cry about slavery. I know that you are not acquainted with the secrets of
                  the Abolition party, for Parson Blake told me you were too much of a "milk-sop" to
                  be trusted. Now, I have no doubt that there are many abolitionists who are, as I
                  believe you to be, conscientious about slavery, and who have been led to suppose
                  the negro race terribly treated in the South, and it is the object of all such men
                  as Parson Blake to keep up this impression for the accomplishment of their own
                  ends—which are, to set the negroes free from their present position, to establish
                  a separate Republic, under the government of the Abolition party, exclusively—to
                  compel the negroes to labor for such wages as they receive North, and to drive all
                  those who prove troublesome off, as the Indians have been.'</p>
               <p>"I could scarcely believe the man's statement—Rice was his name—and told him I
                  thought he was harsh in his judgment, particularly of Parson Blake.</p>
               <p>"'If so,' he replied, 'why do they employ men of the worst character to do their
                  dirty work—such as inciting the negroes to rebellion, etc., or else keep others in
                  the dark concerning their real motives, as you have been? Three of the very men
                  who left New-York with us, were the most abandoned villains, and their characters
                  known to most of the Abolition party. Parson Blake knew they started with a Bible
                  in one pocket and a pack of cards in the other, to preach or gamble, as the
                  occasion required. I was out of employment when they nabbed me—in fact, could not
                  make an honest living upon the wages I got for my work. I am a good mechanic, and
                  have a tolerably fair English education, yet, I tell you, a negro fellow gets more
                  for his work here in one day than I could for three days' work at the North. They
                  offered me good wages, and the promise of an independent fortune when the South
                  comes into their possession; but I think the rascals are doomed to disappointment.
                  They may do considerable harm to individuals, but I don't think this glorious
                  country will ever fall into the hands of such a set of unprincipled land pirates.
                  Now, Mr. Layton, if you have any doubts concerning old Blake's opinion of you,
                  read that.' He handed me a letter; I knew the writing to be Parson Blake's. I read
                  as follows:</p>

               <p>"As if by magic, the whole villany appeared before me, in its true light. I saw
                  myself the miserable dupe of an impious hypocrite, and the tool of a set of
                  piratical outlaws. My deserted fireside rose to view—my neglected wife and child.
                  I was almost paralyzed by feelings of grief and indignation.</p>
               <p>"'Are you now convinced?' said Mr. Rice.</p>
               <p>"'Perfectly,' I replied, 'and I am under lasting obligations for the information
                  you have given me.' We parted friends. He had determined to make his way to Texas,
                  and settle permanently.</p>
               <p>"The anxiety of mind that I had endured for years, and the delving, confined life
                  in Parson Blake's office, told fearfully upon my constitution. I was at times
                  unable to attend to business of any kind—a slow fever seemed to be consuming my
                  vitals, and at last I was completely prostrated—I thought, at the time, upon the
                  bed of death. Oh! how I longed for my wife and child. It was a harrowing thought,
                  that I should never see them again; but I was attended in the kindest manner. Mr.
                  Hervey—the minister who had so won my confidence—was untiring in his attentions,
                  and his gentle wife and daughters were as ministering angels, and by their good
                  nursing I was raised from protracted illness to a comparative state of health.</p>
               <p>"During my illness, I gave Mr. Hervey a faithful delineation of my life,
                  particularly in connection with Parson Blake. I did not spare myself in detailing
                  the trials of my family, and told him of not having received ceived letters from
                  you, and of my fears that you had become weary of me, and resolved upon no farther
                  communication.</p>
               <p>"'Never!' was the reply of Mr. Hervey, to my last remark. 'As you have described
                  Mrs. Layton, so gentle, affectionate, long and patiently enduring all, she has
                  never turned a deaf ear to your penitent solicitations for returning confidence.
                  That man, Parson Blake, is probably the sole cause of her silence, in what manner
                  I cannot say, but from what you have told me, he is determined to destroy the
                  peace of your family, and you may rest assured, the strange silence on the part of
                  your wife is in some way to be traced to him.'</p>
               <p>"I felt convinced that his suspicions were correct, for he had both you and myself
                  completely in his power, as his nephew kept the post-office, and I knew him to be
                  perfectly subservient to the parson's wishes. Thus I was debarred from holding
                  communication with my family; but I resolved to save all that I could from my
                  salary, and return to you as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>"Some months later, I was made acquainted with the horrid particulars of a servile
                  insurrection in the South. Several persons had been inhumanly murdered. The
                  ring-leaders were white men, two of the company with which I had been connected.
                  The outraged inhabitants lynched the traitors, as they deserved. I cannot describe
                  to you my state of feelings upon hearing of these horrors. I felt guilty, and
                  could no longer bear to remain among a people against whom I had sinned fearfully.
                  I collected what was due from my school, and started for home; but was detained on
                  the way many weeks, by severe illness, which has left me, as you see, almost ready
                  for the grave."</p>

               <head>Chapter Twenty-ninth.</head>
               <p>HORACE LAYTON'S health would not admit of his pursuing regular employment of any
                  kind. He occasionally kept accounts for the Railroad Company, for a moderate
                  compensation; but his disease was of a nature so debilitating that exertion,
                  either mental or physical, was attended with danger. Mary's toils were in no
                  degree lightened, but the shade of despondency that, for years, dwelt upon her
                  brow, had fled. Horace was no longer the tool of evil men, and though his life was
                  fast wearing away, Mary was near to minister to his wants, and soothe his passage
                  to the tomb. The little cot needed many comforts, but its inmates were blessed
                  with restored confidence. Ellen's cheerful smile often lightened the fading hopes
                  of her invalid father, and her tender care soothed his suffering hours.</p>
               <p>Horace bestowed every attention upon Ellen's education, admissible with his low
                  state of health; and she applied herself with avidity to studies that many girls
                  of her age would have considered far beyond their comprehension. Her progress was
                  rapid. She wished to fit herself for the situation of governess, and cherished the
                  hope that, at no distant period, she would be enabled by her exertions to support
                  her parents in comfort. How proud Horace felt of his beautiful and gifted
                  daughter; yet, when he thought of the overshadowed prospect that lay before her,
                  he shuddered with apprehension, and mourned without ceasing over the wasted time
                  and means, by which his family had been reduced to the necessitous condition of
                  the laborers, in a land where the rich and great flourished, but the poor toiled,
                  and toiled in vain, for the meanest comforts of life. And he had to die, and leave
                  Mary and Ellen amid the merciless. He knew what they had already endured, and he
                  could hope for nothing better in future. Often would he try to flatter himself
                  with the hope, that he might yet recover, or perchance live many years, to make
                  some amends to the dear ones for his neglected duties; and it seemed as if Death
                  kindly stayed the final stroke in pity for his great sorrow. At times exhausted
                  nature appeared ready to succumb; then, again, the vital forces would rally and
                  struggle on. Thus months passed away.</p>

               <p>"ANOTHER letter for Mistress Layton, from Miss Wallace, or rather Mrs. Sterling. I
                  know the writing. Well, she is determined not to give up her old friend. Some
                  years since the last letter came from the land of abominations. I wonder what's
                  the news?" Parson Blake sat in his study, and indulged in his favorite habit of
                  talking to himself, or, as the Scotch say of this habit, "talkin' wi' the de'il."
                  A servant had just handed him a letter from the post office, and retired. The
                  Parson expressed himself upon the occasion, as we have recorded above. He read
                  intently, seeming vastly interested.</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6177-00000046"/>
               <p>"Really," he exclaimed, "this is important intelligence. Ellen is a beautiful
                  girl; I have felt extremely interested in her of late—how old is she? let me
                  see—nearly sixteen; charming age! and she is entitled to something like <emph>ten
                     thousand dollars</emph> in cash. Horace is almost dead, and his wife will soon
                  follow. It will be right and proper for me to take charge of Ellen." He rang the
                  bell; a servant appeared.</p>
               <p>"Ralph."</p>
               <p>"Sir?"</p>
               <p>"Take a dish of fine strawberries and a bowl of cream to Mr. Layton."</p>
               <p>The man opened his eyes wide with surprise, and remained holding the door-knob,
                  hesitatingly.</p>
               <p>"Did you understand what I said, sir?" The parson spoke in a sharp tone. He was
                  accustomed to implicit obedience.</p>
               <p>"I guess not," said the servant. "I understood you to bid me 'take a dish of
                  strawberries and cream to Mr. Layton.'"</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, that is just what I said. Go at once, and present them with my
                  respects."</p>
               <p>The man closed the door, and gave a low, protracted whistle, as if to give vent to
                  his astonishment.</p>
               <p>Horace was lying upon a rude couch, in the little vine-covered porch, when Ralph
                  arrived with the strawberries, cream, and respects.</p>
               <p>"Take them back to your master," he said, when Ralph had delivered his message,
                  "and tell him they would be acceptable from any other source."</p>
               <p>"Just as I expected," said Parson Blake, when the man informed him of Horace's
                  refusal to accept his tempting offering. "Horace has become an exceedingly
                  ill-tempered person. Well, I acted with Christian kindness by sending him a
                  refreshing dish; don't you think so, Ralph?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, sir; nobody hereabouts would have done such a good deed but you."</p>
               <p>"Do you think everybody in the neighborhood reposes as much confidence in me as
                  you do, Ralph?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, sir, unless it be them Laytons. You know they don't like you a bit."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Ralph, you see Horace has been led astray. He has sojourned with the ungodly,
                  in a land where a suffering and suppressed race groan in anguish of body and soul,
                  and where the light of the Gospel is unknown. His heart has become hard, and much
                  I fear he is lost, lost! but I wash my hands free from further soil with him. I
                  have labored, without ceasing, to awaken him to a sense of his unworthiness." The
                  parson sighed heavily, and turned away.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter Thirty-first.</head>
               <p>SPRING was again present, clothed in her brightest robes of green, and the air
                  soft and bracing. Horace Layton was tempted forth by the beauty of the day. He had
                  been closely confined to the house during the severe winter.</p>
               <p>"Come, daughter," said he to Ellen, "let us ramble in the wood, and see if we
                  cannot find some early wild flowers."</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6177-00000047"/>
               <p>They walked slowly, for Horace was very feeble, and had not gone far in the wood
                  when he was compelled to stop and rest. "I will sit here in the shade, Ellen,
                  while you run about for the flowers. I may over-tax my strength if I walk too far,
                  and not be able to get back to the house without assistance."</p>
               <p>Ellen remembered to have seen quite a variety of wild blossoms on the roadside
                  leading to Parson Blake's, and she hastened to get them; but had scarcely reached
                  the spot, when she observed Parson Blake advancing to meet her. Ellen turned away
                  to avoid him, but he approached rapidly, smiling, as usual, and with extended
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"How very glad I am to see you abroad, Ellen. I have really felt alarmed lest
                  close confinement with your father should impair your health. How is Horace?"</p>
               <p>"We cannot see that he improves," she replied, sorrowfully; "he has walked out
                  this morning for the first time in several months."</p>
               <p>"Ah, well, he may live in his present condition for a long time. I have known
                  consumptive persons, as low as he is, to live for many years, especially when
                  provided with necessary luxuries."</p>
               <p>"But we cannot supply my poor father with even the plainest comforts, suited to an
                  invalid," said Ellen, with quivering iip.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you may have it in your power to do so, Ellen, by using your influence with
                  your parents to overcome the very <emph>strange</emph> dislike which they seem to
                  have conceived to me <emph>lately.</emph> I wish to befriend Horace, and can
                  certainly add materially to his comfort. I have been a long and tried friend to
                  your father, Ellen, and it grieves me sorely to find that, without cause, he has
                  become so set against me." The parson wiped his eyes with a delicately scented
                  cambric handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Ellen gathered the flowers in her basket, but made no reply.</p>
               <p>"I have been watching your unfolding beauties for some time, Ellen," said the
                  parson, "and cannot express how very charming you appear to me. I hope that you,
                  too, do not dislike me?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot say that I really dislike any one, Parson Blake."</p>
               <p>"That's a good girl; you must not dislike any one, but I would have you love me,
                  Ellen. Will you not slip off from home sometimes, and meet me in this beautifully
                  retired spot, where we can talk over plans for the comfort of your parents?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir," said Ellen, firmly, "I never leave home without the consent of my
                  parents."</p>
               <p>"That is also very right; a young lady who is so dutiful to her parents, will
                  surely make a good wife."</p>
               <p>Ellen had made her selection of flowers, and bowing coolly to Parson Blake, walked
                  on to meet her father. She heard a quick, heavy step near, and turning around, was
                  provoked to find the parson following her.</p>
               <p>"I will go and see your father, Ellen, and you must persuade him to let me again
                  be his friend."</p>
               <p>Ellen smiled contemptuously, but made no reply. She was soon at her father's side,
                  and placed the flowers before him. He thanked her, but looked up in surprised
                  displeasure, to find her in company with Parson Blake.</p>
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6177-00000048"/>
               <p>"How do you feel, Horace? I am really glad to find you able to be about. Ellen and
                  I have been arranging some nice plans for your comfort."</p>
               <p>Horace did not reply; he glanced into Ellen's face, and understood the look of
                  indignation that she cast upon Parson Blake.</p>
               <p>"I hope you will not object, Horace, to throwing aside all bad feelings between
                  us, and establishing the firm friendship of olden times."</p>
               <p>"Never!" said Horace; "I shall not be induced now to view you in any other light
                  than as my most bitter enemy." The parson's quick temper flared up in a
                  moment.</p>
               <p>"Well," he replied, "I do not care a straw for your anger; and you had better be
                  more guarded in your speech, for I have it in my power to be an enemy really. I
                  came before you this morning as a friend. I wish to make honorable proposals for
                  your daughter. If Ellen marries me, you will, of course, fare much better."</p>
               <p>Horace Layton started from his seat, his eyes staring wildly, and his nostrils
                  dilated to transparency.</p>
               <p>"Villain!" he gasped hoarsely, "dare you propose such a thing—to sacrifice my
                  lovely young daughter?"</p>
               <p>"Call it sacrifice, if you choose," said the parson, hissing through his closed
                  teeth, "but how can you help yourself? You are almost a dead man; your wife is
                  very little better off in health; now, when Ellen becomes an orphan, the law
                  appoints me her guardian. I could take her at this time in my charge, upon the
                  plea of your inability to support her, but I suppose she would be reluctant to
                  leave you; yet, if you are not more conciliatory, I shall most certainly put the
                  law in force, and com—" What farther remarks he would have made, were choked back;
                  Horace sprang upon him with the fury of a tiger. All the pent-up resentment of
                  years burst forth; he could endure nothing more from the monster who had heaped
                  wretchedness, in every shape, upon him; his thin fingers were buried deep in the
                  crimson flesh of Parson Blake's throat, and he held on with the vice-like grasp of
                  a drowning man. A torrent of life blood gushed from his lips; he had ruptured a
                  blood-vessel, and he gasped for breath, but did not a second relax his hold on his
                  merciless tormentor. Terror was depicted in Parson Blake's countenance, and he
                  held up his hands imploringly to Ellen. She called beseechingly upon her father to
                  desist, but the ear was deaf, the eye lost to sight forever—horace was dead, and
                  his corpse clung to Parson Blake with life-like avidity. Ellen attempted to
                  unclasp the dead fingers, but so rigidly contracted were the muscles, they seemed
                  like bands of iron—she could not move them. Parson Blake's face had become livid,
                  and his eyes blood-shot. Ellen saw that he was suffocating, and ran with
                  frightened speed for assistance.</p>
               <p>"Come to my father—come to Parson Blake!" was all she could say, when she reached
                  the nearest house. Several persons followed her back to the wood, but it was too
                  late to avail the living—the two souls had gone into the presence of the unerring
                  Judge. Parson Blake would sin no more upon earth.</p>

               <p>THE horrid catastrophe was speedily detailed by the abolition press, and was cited
                  as another instance of the depraving influence of Southern society. Horace Layton
                  was represented to have been, at one time, a moral and Christian person; but had,
                  unfortunately, resided among slaveholders, and consequently became a perverted
                  man; he returned home in low circumstances and ill health; Parson Blake kindly
                  assisted him, and endeavored to reclaim him, but was often insulted, and at the
                  very time the pious parson met his death, he was persuading his
                     <emph>murderer</emph> to forsake his evil ways and repent before it was too
                  late.</p>
               <p>So much for the truth of abolition statements.</p>
               <p>Poor Horace was carried to his grave without funeral ceremony. No pious soul
                  reminded the sorrowing widow and orphan of the blessed promises of the
                  resurrection; no friendly voices united in harmony to chant the funeral requiem.
                  Mary and Ellen were the only mourners, and bitter indeed was their grief, yet they
                  were thankful he had not died as a traitor—that he had lived to see the error of
                  his ways and repent of the evil into which he had been led.</p>
               <p>Mary notified the pharisaical community that her cottage was for sale. She was
                  anxious to leave a place so fraught with misery to her. Those good people were
                  very <emph>conscientious,</emph> and gave not <emph>quite half</emph> the value of
                  her house—barely sufficient to bear her expenses elsewhere, until she could find
                  some means of support. She thought it best to locate in New-York city; she wished
                  to take a school. With Ellen's assistance, she was prepared to teach the usual
                  branches of female education, both solid and ornamental. She found no difficulty
                  in meeting with a good boarding establishment, but she discovered that her scanty
                  purse would go but a short way in paying the fare, and she at once made unwearied
                  attempts to procure employment, both for herself and Ellen.</p>

                  attempts to obtain a school were attended with complete failure; neither could she
                  meet with the situation of assistant teacher for Ellen or herself in any of the
                  academies throughout the city. A number of recommendations and references was
                  required, and poor Mary had none. She was conscious of her own competency and that
                  of her daughter; both were anxious that a select committee should investigate
                  their claims to preferment; but without the requisite credentials, the desired
                  office could not be granted to them, however worthy they might prove—so said the
                  spectacled principals of the literary institutions.</p>

               </note>
               <p>Mrs. Layton was recommended to place her daughter<pb n="98-99"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000050"/> with Madame Frivoli, the ruling mantuamaker of the
                  metropolis, who was said to afford very liberal wages to those who suited her. She
                  resided in an elegant four-story house, in a conspicuous part of the city. Mrs.
                  Layton called upon the queen mantuamaker, and was ushered into the presence of a
                  very masculine-looking woman, apparently verging upon fifty years. She was richly
                  dressed, and quite affable in manner. When Madame Frivoli learned the object of
                  Mrs. Layton's visit, she expressed a wish to know of Ellen's age and personal
                  appearance.</p>
               <p>"My daughter is nearly seventeen; of her appearance you can better judge from your
                  own observation," was Mrs. Layton's reply.</p>
               <p>"Ah, well," said madame, "I dare say she is quite charming. We will have her to
                  come at the earliest convenience."</p>
               <p>Mary was not pleased with Madame Frivoli, and felt very reluctant to place Ellen
                  under her care. The woman's gaudy dress and rouged cheeks indicated a weak mind
                  and depraved taste, yet Ellen had been carefully trained, and was so pure and
                  truthful that her mother was convinced she would not be influenced to act contrary
                  to her own views of rectitude. Mary told Ellen she was not favorably impressed by
                  Madame Frivoli's appearance, yet, at the same time, said she might prove to be a
                  very worthy person.</p>
               <p>Madame Frivoli expressed herself as being delighted with Ellen's beauty; she
                  kissed her upon the forehead, and called her "Pet," and declared that Ellen must
                  have dresses of a more fashionable cut and fabric than the plain materials in
                  which she was attired.</p>
               <p>"I cannot afford to appear better dressed than I am now," said Ellen, blushing. "I
                  pray, madame, that you will not require me to be clothed in a manner that will not
                  accord with my circumstances."</p>
               <p>"Tut, tut, child, do not trouble yourself with unnecessary scruples; it is my
                  business to see that you are not shabby. Our interest requires us to appear well
                  before the world—nothing like making a good appearance, my dear, be assured of
                  that."</p>
               <p>Ellen was conducted to a room in the third story, where a number of young girls
                  were at work upon various articles of apparel, for both ladies and gentlemen's
                  wear. They were fashionably dressed, but appeared jaded and unhappy. The room was
                  close, soiled and unfurnished, with the exception of several tables and the pine
                  stools, used as seats for the girls.</p>
               <p>Madame Frivoli was much pleased with Ellen's work, particularly her embroidery.
                  She insisted upon having her attired as were the other girls of the establishment,
                  and seemed determined to spoil Ellen by flattery.</p>
               <p>"You are not conscious of your charms, my dear," she once said to Ellen, when
                  alone with her. "It is surely your own fault that you have not already been
                  celebrated for your uncommon beauty. You must not be so diffident, so extremely
                  reserved."</p>
               <p>"I do not care to be admired, madame; I am only anxious to earn a support for my
                  dear mother," was Ellen's reply.</p>
               <p>"Ah, but suppose you should meet with the chance to marry some rich man, and never
                  have to work any more, as you now do, would you not be very silly to avoid the
                  good fortune that might befall you?"</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6177-00000051"/>
               <p>"I do not expect any such 'good fortune' as you say, madame, but shall always
                  endeavor to conduct myself with propriety."</p>
               <p>The flattery of Madame Frivoli had a very different effect from what she
                  anticipated. Ellen was a well educated and refined girl. Such gross blandishments
                  were disgusting to her, and she could not forbear feeling contempt for one of
                  madame's age, who spoke with such frivolity.</p>
               <p>The superintendence of the sewing-room, and also of the girls employed, was
                  confided entirely to a couple of thin-visaged matrons, who, from their unrelenting
                  watchfulness, were nicknamed by the girls the "spiders." There was no such thing
                  as eluding the watchfulness of the "spiders," and the over-worked girls scarcely
                  dared to raise their eyes from the needle, though confined from sunrise till dark,
                  and not unfrequently for several hours in the night.</p>
               <p>Among the elder girls, Ellen noticed one who appeared to have once been beautiful.
                  Her hair and eyes were of raven blackness, and her features regular, but her
                  complexion was sallow, and her form somewhat stooping, from close confinement. She
                  was called Miss Land. Ellen had several times, when the "spiders" were not by,
                  observed Miss Land to be looking at her, with a pitying expression of countenance,
                  and appeared to wish for some opportunity of speaking with her; but they did not
                  occupy the same part of the room, and free conversational intercourse among the
                  girls was not permitted. Only those who sat together were allowed to converse. At
                  the expiration of the sewing hours, the "spiders" conducted the girls to the
                  crowded sleeping apartments, in which they were locked; and they were not allowed
                  to leave their rooms under any circumstances whatever, unless in possession of a
                  written permission from Madame Frivoli. Frequently she went to the theatre, and
                  carried a particular number of them with her. At such times, they were gaudily
                  dressed, and by the help of lily-white and rouge, the very pictures of health. It
                  was a mystery to Ellen how madame could so very speedily have her own cast-off
                  finery converted into elegant-looking dresses for the girls. The clothes with
                  which she was furnished were all "refuse" from madame's wardrobe. Ellen would
                  greatly have preferred her own plain attire, but she was not allowed to have her
                  own way. Madame Frivoli had requested Mrs. Layton not to visit her daughter
                  oftener than every second week; she gave good excuses for this restriction, and
                  Mrs. Layton was compelled, though reluctantly, to consent.</p>
               <p>Ellen had been with madame several days, and met with no opportunity of speaking
                  to Miss Land, for the "spiders" were unremitting in their watchfulness, and seemed
                  particularly anxious to keep Ellen from communicating with the elder girls. She
                  felt confident that Miss Land was disposed to be her friend, and she appeared to
                  be much more refined than the girls with whom Ellen was allowed to associate. They
                  were objectionable, both in manners and conversation. Fortunately for the wishes
                  of Ellen and Miss Land, an unexpected occurrence afforded them a few moments'
                  unobserved conversation. A spirit-lamp exploded in the sewing-room, and the
                  terrified girls ran in every direction to avoid the burning fluid. Miss Land
                     was<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6177-00000052"/> quickly at Ellen's side; they
                  ran from the room together, and stopped in a dark corner of the entry. Miss land
                  clasped Ellen's hand tightly within her own.</p>
               <p>"My dear child," said she, "I know you are now good and pure; in this house, your
                  beauty will prove your ruin. Take the first opportunity for escaping, but do not
                  let Madame Frivoli suspect your intentions."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, dear Miss Land," said Ellen; "how kind of you to warn me of my danger;
                  but how can I escape? We are all watched so closely during the day, and locked in
                  our rooms at night."</p>
               <p>"I understand that Madame Frivoli intends you to visit the theatre to-morrow
                  night, in company with her; you shall not go if I can help it; but when she
                  mentions the subject to you, appear to be pleased with the idea; I will manage it
                  so that you escape in some way. Go in the room alone; I hear the 'spiders'
                  calling. They must not know that we have been in company."</p>
               <p>Ellen found the danger past; no one was injured by the explosion. The girls were
                  ordered to "file" off to bed; Ellen's heart beat wildly. She was alarmed beyond
                  measure by Miss Land's warning, and resolved not to close her eyes in sleep, while
                  she remained beneath Madame Frivoli's roof, but to watch every moment for some
                  opportunity to leave the hated premises.</p>
               <p>On the following morning Madame Frivoli sent for Ellen to make her appearance in
                  the drawing-room. She found madame in conversation with a fashionably-clad young
                  man, who was lolling on the sofa.</p>
               <p>"Miss Layton," said Madame Frivoli, "you are in the presence of Congressman
                  B."</p>
               <p>Ellen suppressed the smile that danced to her lip, at madame's novel mode of
                  introduction, and bowed slightly to Congressman B.</p>
               <p>He took no farther notice of the introduction than to fasten his opera-glass over
                  one eye, and gaze impudently upon Ellen's blushing countenance.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of my pet, sir?" inquired Madame Frivoli of the
                  "honorable."</p>
               <p>"Extremely bootiful," he replied in the affected fashionable pronunciation of the
                  city exquisite. "Come here, my dear, and tell me how old <emph>it is</emph>," he
                  continued, addressing Ellen. She paid no attention to his request, but continued
                  standing beside madame's chair.</p>
               <p>"Did you not hear the honorable gentleman inquire your age, Miss Layton? I am
                  surprised that you have not the politeness to treat your superiors with due
                  respect." Madame Frivoli spoke with severity, and timid Ellen trembled.</p>
               <p>"Don't scold, Frivoli," said Congressman B. "it [meaning Ellen] will get over all
                  that shyness."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, certainly she will, sir; Ellen is but seventeen—a mere unsophisticated
                  child."</p>
               <p>"Well, <emph>it</emph> must learn to talk to me, Frivoli."</p>
               <p>"To be sure, sir; you need not trouble yourself upon that score. Go, Ellen, and
                  ask Mr. B. what colors he prefers; you are to have the honor of embroidering a
                  vest for him."</p>
               <p>Ellen did not advance a step nearer to the lounging honorable, but addressed him
                  coolly, saying:</p>
               <p>"What pattern and colors do you prefer, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, let me think—Coopid weposing amid half-blown<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000053"/> blown woses for a design, and extwemely delicate
                  shades of pink, green, and wiolet. Will not that combination form a love of a
                  west, my dear?"</p>
               <p>"Most probably," replied Ellen, in the same distant tone with which she first
                  addressed him.</p>
               <p>"You can now retire, <emph>miss.</emph>" Madame Frivoli laid considerable stress
                  upon the word "miss." She wished Ellen to understand that she was not altogether
                  pleased with her deportment toward Congressman B.</p>
               <p>Miss Land glanced at Helen as she re-entered the sewing-room, and perceiving that
                  she was much disturbed, readily divined the cause.</p>
               <p>The girls were called to dinner rather earlier than usual, which was generally the
                  case when madame was going abroad with any of them. After they had dined, madame
                  informed the "spiders" that she would take six of the girls to the opera with
                  her—Miss Layton one of the number.</p>
               <p>"I presume it will be a great treat for you to attend the opera, will it not,
                  pet?" said madame.</p>
               <p>Ellen saw Miss Land's eyes fixed upon her, and understood the earnest expression,
                  but she was a novice in the art of dissembling, and her voice trembled, as she
                  replied:</p>
               <p>"Yes, madame, I should like to go."</p>
               <p>"Well, dear, it is my wish for you to go, and you must try to rival the other
                  girls in beauty. Come to my room in an hour, and you will find a splendid dress
                  ready for you."</p>
               <p>As they ascended to the sewing-room, Miss Land was taken with a spasmodic cough.
                  The attack was violent, and she was forced to sit upon the stairs to recover
                  breath. The "spiders" directed the girls to go to work; they left Miss Land alone,
                  as she said she needed no assistance, and would soon be able to follow.</p>
               <p>The hour arrived for Ellen to wait upon madame in her room. With heavy heart she
                  arose from her seat, and laid aside her work; a "spider" had ordered her to go at
                  once. Just as she was on the point of leaving the room, Miss Land called to her,
                  and said:</p>
               <p>"Here are your gloves, Miss Layton; you must have dropped them as you came from
                  dinner. They were upon the stairs."</p>
               <p>"How do you know they are her gloves?" asked a "spider," tartly.</p>
               <p>"I can read well enough to know this to be her name." Miss Land turned a portion
                  of the glove toward the sharp inquisitor, and proved that "Ellen Layton" was
                  written on the inside.</p>
               <p>"Well, give them to her, and go back to your seat," said "spider."</p>
               <p>"They are not mine," innocent Ellen was on the point of saying, when she saw the
                  fine kid gloves. Her poor wardrobe was not in possession of so nice a pair; but,
                  fortunately, she understood the significant glance that Miss Land cast upon her.
                  She took them and said, "Thank you very much." She hastened to the sleeping
                  apartment, and examined the gloves. In one finger she found a strip of paper, and
                  the following lines pencilled upon it:</p>
               <p>"Go to the cellar immediately, and make your escape<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000054"/> cape; the door is unlocked, and the key thrown
                  away. My fit of coughing did it."</p>
               <p>Ellen needed no further direction. With light, trembling steps, she descended the
                  stairs, having first secured her sun-bonnet. Soon after she closed the cellar-door
                  cautiously behind her, and was in the street safe, safe from the house of infamy,
                  thank Heaven!</p>
               <p>"Surely my orders were not understood," soliloquized Madame Frivoli, as she
                  consulted her elegant gold watch. She rang the bell leading from her own to the
                  sewing-room by a wire.</p>
               <p>"Why is not Miss Layton here as I directed?" she inquired of the "spider" who
                  answered the summons from the bell.</p>
               <p>"I sent her to your room more than an hour ago."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean? Dare you deceive me, woman?" said madame, pale with anger.</p>
               <p>"Really, madame, you know well that I would not. I tell you truly, I sent Ellen
                  Layton as you directed, and can prove it by Mrs. Crabb [the second spider] and
                  every girl in the work-room."</p>
               <p>"Search the house from garret to cellar; do you not know, that my
                     <emph>reputation</emph> is at stake? I promised Congressman B. to bring that
                  girl to the opera, and now she is missing. I will lose one of my most faithful
                  customers if he is disposed to resent the disappointment."</p>
               <p>Well, the house was searched thoroughly, without avail. Ellen was nestling upon
                  her mother's bosom, like a frightened bird released from the ravenous hawk.</p>
               <p>"There is a traitor in the camp," said the terribly chagrined madame. "I will give
                  ten dollars for her detection. Who has been seen communicating with Miss
                  Layton?"</p>
               <p>"Nobody," was the reply from girls and spiders.</p>
               <p>"Did any one leave the room with her?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>

               <p>ELLEN did not feel secure till within the house where her mother boarded. Mrs.
                  Layton was busily engaged in sewing, and looked up in joyful surprise as Ellen
                  entered the room; but, upon observing the poor girl's agitation, she hastened
                  toward her in alarm, exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"What has occurred, my child, to trouble you so very much?"</p>
               <p>Ellen told of the danger to which she had been exposed at Madam Frivoli's, and by
                  what means she had escaped.</p>
               <p>"Thank Heaven! darling, you have reached me in safety. How greatly we are indebted
                  to the unhappy girl who so kindly aided you; I trust she may yet be reclaimed from
                  the grasp of that wretched wanton."</p>
               <p>Madam Frivoli felt confident that Ellen could never be induced, by any means, to
                  enter her service again, and was resolved upon revenge for the disappointment of
                  her evil designs. She knew that Mrs. Layton was in extremely straitened
                  circumstances, and supposed<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6177-00000055"/> that she
                  would not have the means of paying the exorbitant bill of fifty dollars, which the
                  madame presented, as due, for the clothing she furnished Ellen—cast-off garments
                  from her own wardrobe, in truth, not worth the tenth part of that sum. Madame
                  believed that she had Mrs. Layton completely in her power, for if the bill was not
                  paid, she intended bringing suit upon it, with the hope of involving her in utter
                  ruin.</p>
               <p>"Oh, mother, do not pay this bill," was Ellen's exclamation, when she looked over
                  it. "You surely will not submit to such extortion. Madame Frivoli forced me to
                  wear those tawdry dresses, and they were nearly worn out when she gave them to
                  me."</p>
               <p>"I would not have any difficulty with her for ten times the amount, if I had it in
                  my possession. We are friendless strangers here, and she doubtless can command the
                  aid of both wealth and power. We must strive, daughter, to make up, in unremitting
                  diligence, what we lose by fraud. 'Tis true, we shall have only a small sum left,
                  when this bill is paid, but we shall be happier with a crust of bread and
                  consciences devoid of offence, than she can ever be, with all her infamous
                  gainings."</p>

               <head>Chapter Thirty-fifth.</head>
               <p>MRS. LAYTON'S health had been for some months rapidly declining. The life stream
                  coursed wearily through the warm channels of her overburdened heart. She felt that
                  a fatal malady had fastened upon her, and gladly would she have gone to rest in
                  the quiet tomb, but for Ellen—lonely, unprotected Ellen. All thoughts of thus
                  leaving her, were torturing to the poor mother's aching breast, and she cherished
                  the hope, that when death had released her from worldly care, Ellen would be again
                  in the home of her infancy, with generous-hearted Annie. Mary had not heard from
                  her Southern friends in many years. She was unacquainted with Annie's place of
                  residence, after her marriage, but supposed that, agreeably to her father's wish,
                  she had not given up the old homestead. She wrote to Annie, telling of her low
                  health and impoverished condition, and craved that she would be a kind friend to
                  Ellen, whenever she might be left alone and unprotected upon the uncharitable
                  world.</p>
               <p>The only means of support within the power of Mrs. Layton and Ellen, was by sewing
                  for the plain-work shops, and their income was so small, they were forced to seek
                  a lodging room at very low wages. Mary roamed through several cleanly streets, and
                  found rooms to rent, in many neat houses, but the terms were far beyond her means.
                  She turned into a narrow, dismal lane. "Rooms to rent," was chalked upon every
                  decayed and wretched-looking house. She entered one.<pb n="110-111"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000056"/> Troops of dirty, half-starved looking children, and
                  intoxicated men and women, were huddled together, several families upon one floor;
                  some were weeping, others cursing and fighting. Mary turned away with frightened
                  disgust. She felt sickened by the scenes of want and vice. "Oh, God!" she
                  murmured, "shall I and mine ever sink to such degraded poverty?" "Rooms to rent,"
                  again caught her eye. The house was rather larger and somewhat retired from the
                  other abodes of wretchedness. She called in, hoping to find the place endurable,
                  at least, for she felt fatigued, and saw at once that she could not meet with
                  anything more than a shelter from the weather, in return for the pittance she
                  could afford in payment. Hugh Jackson, a free negro, living in the house, was
                  empowered to rent the rooms not occupied by his family. He kept a variety shop in
                  the front room, and his family, consisting of a wife and two daughters, occupied
                  the back room adjoining. Mary was conducted to the third story; a small attic,
                  uncomfortable in every respect, was the only place she could find suited to her
                  means. The first quarter's rent was to be paid in advance, and amounted to nearly
                  the whole stock of funds in her possession. Oppressed by a feeling of life
                  weariness, she descended the crazy stairway, destitute of railings, and hastened
                  from the house. A disagreeable odor of burning tallow, seemed to be diffused
                  through the confined air of the alley, and increased the feeling of deathly
                  sickness that overpowered wretched Mary. With difficulty she gained the next
                  street—broad, cleanly, and fresh air freely circulating. She paused to recover
                  breath, supporting her weakened frame against the iron railing around the area of
                  a handsome dwelling. As she stood, the clammy dew, almost of death, dampened her
                  brow, but her poor heart struggled bravely on, in all its agony. Just then two
                  elegantly dressed young men came by, and stopping before Mary, burst into loud
                  laughter.</p>
               <p>"Drunk, hey?" said one, and attempted to push her bonnet rudely from her face. In
                  a second the blood rushed to her cheeks, and she looked with indignation upon the
                  disgraceful specimens of human nature. "I say, Pomley," said one to the other,
                  "did you see that look of insulted dignity?—by the powers she may be Cushman in
                  disguise, or Siddons come to life!"</p>
               <p>"Who knows; strange things happen every day," replied the second
                     <emph>animal.</emph> "Pray, tell us, dear marm, when you will perform Meg
                  Merrilies, or—" "An' be jabers, jist clear the way, or your pretties will be
                  spilt—see there, now!" The speaker was a half-grown Irish boy, carrying a tin
                  bucket, filled to running over, with molasses. He ran, apparently by accident,
                  between the dandies, and spattered their fawn-colored and lavender-tinted
                  pantaloons profusely with the dark brown syrup. As they turned upon him, Mrs.
                  Layton, hastily as possible, in her suffering condition, escaped from the presence
                  of two fair specimens of New-York city "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon
                  ton</foreign>."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Layton concealed from Ellen the distress, and insult to which she had been
                  subjected, in her weary search for a shelter. The poor girl was already too sorely
                  tried, she thought, without additional cause for unhappiness. On the following day
                  they removed to B—— lane. The first person who met them at the<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000057"/> house, was the Irish boy, who had released Mary
                  from the insulting treatment of the Broadway exquisites.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to find an opportunity, my good boy, to thank you for kindly assisting
                  me yesterday, when so much annoyed by rude men."</p>
               <p>"An its meself that don't want ye to be afthur thankin' me for the like o' that,
                  me lady, but didn't their finery git spilt, tho'?" The boy snapped his fingers, in
                  token of satisfaction, at the fops' misfortune.</p>
               <p>"You spilt the molasses accidentally upon them, of course," said Mrs. Layton,
                  artlessly.</p>
               <p>"Be jabers and I didn't tho'; it was meself lookin' at them, all the while I came
                  up the strate, wid me lasses, an says I to meself, me gintlemen, if you don't be
                  off from pesterin the lady, be the time I get up wid you, jist look out for your
                  breeches; an ye see, they waited too long for me patience, and got their pretties
                  spilt, as I told 'em."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Layton could not forbear smiling at the boy's manner of telling his encounter
                  with the dandies, and said: "I trust you were not punished in any way, by the men,
                  for, I must say, the right manner in which you served them."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, ma'am; they swore a bit, but not knowing it was my intintions to trate
                  'em so, they took out o' sight as fast as their tight boots would let 'em."</p>

               <head>Chapter Thirty-sixth.</head>
               <p>RESIDING in the house with Hugh Jackson's family, had proved quite as annoying, as
                  Mrs. Layton and Ellen had anticipated. His two daughters, Rose and Nancy, were
                  both grown, and followed beging as a profession. They did no work, and were either
                  in the streets or lounging about the shop door, ragged and uncleanly. Lucy, their
                  mother, was but little better. She was often intoxicated and lying upon the floor,
                  in happy unconsciousness of the disorder throughout the apartment that served the
                  family, in common, as bed-chamber, kitchen, dining-room, &amp;c. Soiled wash-tubs,
                  cooking utensils, in the same predicament; unmade beds, if wisps of straw thrown
                  upon low cots, and covered with dirty blankets, deserve the name; paneless
                  window-frames, stuffed with old clothes, and here and there a hat crown; a few
                  articles of soiled, torn, finery, hanging around upon rusty nails. Such was the
                  appearance, in general, of the abode wherein Hugh Jackson and his family, native
                  New-York negroes, enjoyed the <emph>blessed privileges of freedom.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The servant of all work in the family was Terry, an Irish boy, whom we have
                  mentioned in a previous chapter. He was bound to Hugh for four years, and was
                  treated in the tyrannical manner, usual with the negro race, toward those under
                  their authority.</p>
               <p>Terry was honest and industrious, but high-tempered; he tried to live in peace
                  with the negroes, but often their impositions and insults were too much for<pb
                     n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6177-00000058"/> his patience, and would result in a
                  fight with the girls, or his opinion of Hugh and his family expressed in terms by
                  no means complimentary. Terry was delighted beyond measure, when he learned that
                  Mrs. Layton and her daughter were to reside in the same house with himself. He had
                  sufficient discernment to discover their lofty position, as truly refined and
                  intellectual women, and felt the respect for them that virtuous merit is certain
                  to receive from all, save those utterly lost to the noblest attributes of human
                  nature. Poor, ignorant boy, as Terry was, he knew well that Mary Layton and her
                  lovely daughter were not in the position for which Nature designed them, and he
                  resolved to lend any effort in his power to assist them.</p>
               <p>"Now, isn't it pitiful," said he, in a low voice, speaking to himself, as he lay
                  awake one night on his bed, a blanket, under the counter in Hugh's shop; "isn't it
                  pitiful to see them illigant crathers living in the same house wid filthy free
                  negroes? Be jabers don't I wish the saints and fairies would help me, to make the
                  dear ladies jist as happy as two queens, sittin on thrones spangled with
                  jewels."</p>
               <p>Terry would sometimes, at night, be of essential service to Mrs. Layton and her
                  daughter, by bringing water for their use, or purchasing necessaries. Poor Ellen
                  was almost afraid to enter the lower story. She could not leave the house without
                  passing through the shop, which was frequently crowded with low, drinking
                  characters, and when business required her to go into the street, she would wait
                  for a signal from Terry, assuring her that the dreaded crowd were then absent.
                  Upon one occasion, after a short absence, as she returned through the shop, an
                  elderly man who had been convening with Hugh, advanced familiarly to her side,
                  saying:</p>
               <p>"I hope I see you well, Miss Layton; upon my word I had no idea that this old
                  house of mine contained anything so charming as yourself. Please allow me the
                  pleasure of calling to see you occasionally. My name is White; you are a tenant of
                  mine."</p>
               <p>"My mother's health is feeble, sir, and we are not in the habit of receiving
                  company," replied Ellen, coolly, as she passed on to her room. She mentioned the
                  circumstance to her mother, and observed: "Perhaps I treated the gentleman too
                  distantly; he may have wished to befriend us; he is not young, and has probably
                  heard of our distress; but, mother, since I have learned of the moral corruption
                  so prevalent here, I am afraid to trust any one, but my own darling mother."</p>
               <p>"Your behavior toward Mr. White was proper, my daughter. It was not gentlemanly or
                  dignified in him to address you, a perfect stranger, so familiarly, and
                  particularly in admiration of your beauty. Under the circumstances in which we are
                  placed, it is much better for you to be too suspicious than too confiding, and if
                  you wrongfully suspect any one, the fault is not in you, but the state of society
                  that forces a young, unprotected and lovely woman, to view man, not in the light
                  which he should wish to be considered, her natural protector, but as her bitterest

               <p>Several days subsequent, Terry handed Ellen a letter, saying that Hugh bid him

               <p>Ellen's face crimsoned with indignation. She folded the letter, and gave it back
                  to Terry, saying, in a sorrowful tone:</p>
               <p>"Terry, I thought you had too much respect for me, even to deliver a letter so
                  insulting as that."</p>
               <p>"An Miss Ellen, by me faith I didn't know it. Hugh, the baste, told me 'twas good
                  news to you I was takin'."</p>
               <p>"I am rejoiced that you are ignorant of its hateful contents. Terry, give the
                  letter back to Hugh, and tell him never again to hand me any letter or message
                  from Mr. White."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lance White was a married man, a leading abolitionist, a member of good
                  standing in the church—a man who made "long prayers and disfiguring faces," who
                  oppressed the widow and orphan—and who made <emph>inflammatory speeches against
                     the unrighteousness, tyranny, and immorality of the South!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Layton had been suffering throughout the day with intense pain in the region
                  of the heart, and was weak and nervous. Ellen did not mention a word of Mr.
                  White's detestable communication to her. She knew it would add to her mother's
                  distress.</p>
               <p>Several months had elapsed since Mary wrote South, yet she had received no answer.
                  She felt certain that Annie had never received the letter. A few years, Mary
                  thought, could not have changed the generous, kind-hearted child, into a callous,
                  selfish woman. Perhaps Annie had gone before her, to the grave.</p>

               <p>A GREAT annoyance to Mary, in her feeble state of health, was the regular meeting
                  of a branch of the Abolition party, twice a week, in the room beneath her
                  apartment. The object of the meeting appeared to be for incendiary purposes, and
                  was composed of ministers, Congressmen, gamblers, negroes, and <emph>pious
                     ladies.</emph> Terrible descriptions of the slave sufferings were detailed.
                  Mary could hear every word distinctly, and a smile almost of derision flitted
                  across her wan face, as she looked around the wretched attic, in which she
                  languished for bare necessaries, and thought of the well-fed, well-clothed,
                  careless slaves. Preachers prated about the unrighteous, immoral Southerners. Mary
                  thought of the starving, degraded herds of her own race, living like soulless
                  brutes, in every alley and by-way of the city; crowds of young girls, just budding
                  into womanhood, roaming homeless through the streets, ignorant, desperate, hungry,
                  and ragged. Many of them beautiful as the fairest conceptions of Raphael—driven
                  into sin, cast forth to die. God help them. <emph>Pious ladies,</emph> too,<pb
                     n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6177-00000060"/> told of the extensive subscriptions
                  they raised, for the purpose of supplying the slaves with weapons of warfare, and
                  the advancement of—"What?"</p>
               <p>Crimes that fiends might blush to own. And Congressmen pledged themselves to go
                  forth in high places, disseminating treason and all other lawless doctrines—to
                  walk upon the dead bodies of their slaughtered kinsmen, from Louisiana to Maine,
                  if necessary, to further their unprincipled and piratical ends. And does the fate,
                  one might say, of the whole civilized world, depend upon the decision of such a
                  motley crew of bloodthirsty, fanatical parricides? For, though the unprincipled
                  abolition contest may, in the first instance, have emanated from depraved sources,
                  like pestilential exhalations, it is evidently carrying its baneful effects into
                  the very heart of society, with the power of some epidemic, threatening
                  destruction to all moral and social integrity. The amalgamation of the white and
                  African races would be an outrage upon the laws of nature. In mental, moral, or
                  physical organization, the African, whether by original stamp or as a curse, ranks
                  in the lowest scale of human existence, and those who would dare, in defiance of
                  the strict line of demarkation placed by the Creator, to foredoom the unborn
                  generations of a superior race to degradation, are guilty of heinous wickedness.

               <p>The proper station for the <emph>American</emph> negro, is such as he occupies in
                  the Southern States—a subordinate, under kind, firm, parental government; and it
                  is only in the South that he has attained anything like a moral and social
                  position. It is quite possible that error may be connected with Southern slavery,
                  for if it were not, the system might be viewed as the only perfect form of
                  government in the whole world!</p>

               <head>Chapter Thirty-eighth.</head>
               <p>IT was on a bright, starlit evening, that a party of medical students left a
                  fashionable hotel on Broadway. Each was provided with a fragrant Havana, and as
                  amusement was the object in view, they paused upon the steps to hold a
                  consultation as to farther proceedings.</p>
               <p>"Well," said one, who had been called Hadley by his companions, "what shall we do,
                  boys?—go to the opera? stroll on the Battery? attend speaking at the Hall? There
                  is a celebrated abolition chap, from Massachusetts, on hand, to-night."</p>
               <p>"Let us hear him hold forth, by all means," said the party, with one voice.</p>
               <p>"But what shall we do with Malcom Sterling?" said Hadley; "as he is a Southerner,
                  we might have a fuss on hand; you know he is as hot as pepper, on the Southern
                  Rights question."</p>
               <p>"Never fear about me," replied Malcom; "if I see cause for fighting, I shall most
                  assuredly do it, but you are all at liberty to get out of harm's way, as fast as
                  you please."</p>
               <p>"That's fair enough," said Hadley, laughing, "so let's on to the field of
                  battle."</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6177-00000061"/>
               <p>They arrived in good time. The speaking had just commenced. Mr. Lance White, one
                  of the most efficient members of the abolition party in the city, was delivering
                  an inflammatory prelude to the burst of eloquent indignation that was expected
                  from the Massachusetts orator, upon the devoted South. Mr. White dwelt with
                  manifest interest upon the great wealth of the south, a peculiarity of the
                  abolition party, and described the slaveholders as a set of sensual, tyrannical
                  nabobs, leading indolent and worthless lives, while a wretched, oppressed, and
                  unhappy race toiled incessantly for their benefit. "The slaves," said the
                     <emph>very truthful</emph> Mr. Lance White, "reap little or no benefit from
                  their arduous labor. They have no privileges, moral or religious, are destitute of
                  the comforts of life, and upon the slightest infringement of the laws of their
                  merciless oppressors, are subjected to the most inhuman tortures. Now, is it not
                  out of the question for us, who consider ourselves a moral and religious people,
                  to countenance such indignity? Shall we permit this tyranny to exist? Down with
                  the slaveholder, I say; let the black man have his rights. I cry for justice,
                  justice," and the speaker brought his clenched hands down upon the stand before
                  him, with a mighty bang. His tirade ended, and he was warmly applauded.</p>
               <p>Next the speaker from Massachusetts rose. He rolled his eyes over the
                  congregation, as if to see what effect his presence had already produced, and with
                  his face lengthened to the uttermost capacity of its muscular development, he
                  commenced in a slow, solemn voice, seeming to come from the very depths of his
                  tortured tured soul. He endorsed all that Mr. White had said against the demonized
                  land, and feared that retribution would be visited upon the North, if she any
                  longer connived at the wickedness of the south. He bid them listen to the call
                  from across the broad Atlantic, in behalf of the enslaved African, to hear the
                  voice raised against the South, wherever "Religion had established her humane
                  laws. His effusion was much too lengthy for an entire insertion in our pages, and
                  a mere repetition of the slanderous libels against the South, that had been, time
                  and again, bandied about by the traitorous abolition party; yet, to the vitiated
                  tastes of its followers, these narrations were always new, and welcome as the
                  tales of "wicked giants and good fairies," to the greedy ears of children, who
                  know very well the tales are false, yet love "so much" to think them true. The
                  speaker called pathetically upon the audience to subscribe liberally toward the
                  advancement of the "righteous cause," and descended from the pulpit, hat in hand,
                  for the purpose of handing around, with the hope of its being the receptacle of
                  the dollars and cents of the humanely disposed.</p>
               <p>Just then a rapid step sounded along the aisle, and the young Southerner, Malcolm
                  Sterling, entered the stand, and addressing the audience, said:</p>
               <p>"I have listened with attention to the tirade of abuse levelled against my native
                  land, and, as a Southerner, shall take the liberty of making a few remarks in her
                  vindication; I solicit your attention. The harangues imposed upon an intelligent
                  audience, by the speakers who have addressed you to-night, are too ridiculously
                  false to merit attention, were it not for the consideration<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000062"/> tion that the degradation and ruin of the South is
                  the object of the Abolition party; and it is by means of slander and the
                  unprincipled incendiary, that it hopes to effect this very
                     <emph>praiseworthy</emph> design. Is there an individual present, acquainted
                  with the history of the United States, that is not aware of the character for
                  generosity and chivalry awarded to the sons of the South, and that of the most
                  endearing virtues to her daughters? Is it probable that people, celebrated for
                  their hospitality and refinement, would commit or countenance the barbarities you
                  have heard detailed? Is it the land that gave birth to the immortal Washington and
                  others, illustrious for wisdom and piety, that is denounced as the abode of
                  unparalleled oppression? The accusation is false, and no right-minded individual
                  believes it. I very much suspect that the representations which you make of
                  Southern unkindness toward the African, are based upon your own mode of treating
                  him; and I venture to assert, that out of ten slaveholders who might be considered
                  too exacting, nine out of that number would prove to be Northerners by birth and
                  education. Southerners treat their slaves with leniency, and make every allowance
                  for their mental defects. We know them to be our inferiors as a class of human
                  beings; but if you think them your equals, you are welcome to your opinion, for
                  surely you have the best right to judge of the matter; and agreeably to the laws
                  of affinity, similar natures will seek to be upon a level.</p>
               <p>"Now, allow me to ask what you have done for the African here in your very midst?
                  They were slaves as long as you needed them, and when their services were
                  supplanted by your numerous class of white people, who toil with more diligence
                  and faithfulness for a bare sustenance, then you sold what slaves you could, and
                  set the balance free, to starve, or become the worthless, degraded and vicious
                  beings who roam at large, a nuisance to your community, and in every respect so
                  far inferior to the slaves of the South, as scarcely to deserve comparison with
                  them. As you appear to be quite ignorant with regard to the true position of the
                  slave population in the Southern States, I will give an explanation somewhat in
                  detail. Upon an average, the half of every planter's crop is appropriated to the
                  provision of his slaves. They are furnished with all the necessaries of life, and
                  many of the luxuries. Every slave is allowed time for making his own crop—the sale
                  of which, not unfrequently, amounts to a hundred dollars, or more. With this sum
                  he does as he pleases, and I am quite sure that many families in this part of the
                  world have not as much for their annual support as one slave has for pocket-money.
                  In sickness, they receive the best medical attention the country affords, and
                  careful nursing. They attend church, regularly, and numbers of them are members of
                  the different persuasions, and they have their feasts and festivals—in short, I do
                  believe the slave population of the South to be happier and more advanced in
                  civilization than any of their race upon the face of the earth. It is quite
                  possible that some masters are too exacting with their slaves, and it is as much
                  to be deprecated as that some parents are too harsh with their children; but the
                  master who maltreats his slave is amenable to the laws of the<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000063"/> South, as the father who illtreats his child. Sirs,
                  I am anxious to know how it happens that, with consciences so exquisitely alive to
                  the shadow of injustice toward the black man, you feel so little concern for the
                  poor outcast red man. Is he not also your brother, or is not his complexion sable
                  enough for you to admit his claims of relationship?</p>
               <p>"The Indian has been much more harshly dealt with than has been the African. His
                  home has been taken from him; his children sold into slavery, and his kindred
                  murdered. This was the work of our ancestors, and as you cry for justice for one
                  savage race, I wish to be just toward another. Come, give up your fine houses; let
                  the sounds of civilization echo no more through your gas-lit and granite-paved
                  streets. Go back to whatever power in Europe you by parentage belong—the
                  mother-country is strangely distressed concerning the transgressions of some of
                  her lawless offspring, who still retain possession of the slaves she sold them,
                  and, after pocketing the funds, she now cries lustily for their freedom—so let us
                  all act with disinterested benevolence toward the black and red man, and crowd
                  back to the good old country where throngs of starving, miserable wretches already
                  line her streets, and prisons, and highways, where pomp and power little heed the
                  suffering ones at home.</p>
               <p>"'Well,' say you, 'for what purpose am I to go back? Must I beggar myself and my
                  innocent children by vain attempts to make restitution for what my ancestors did?
                  It would look like the work of insanity to consign these magnificent edifices, and
                  the improvements of centuries, into the destructive hands of the savages. The idea
                  is too preposterous to merit the least attention. Oh, I perceive you can reason
                  very logically when your interest and your children's interest, and your
                  institutions, are in danger; but I suppose it is a matter of no consequence what
                  becomes of the South, and her children, and her institutions. You spurned the
                  African race—the South has befriended them, and by her judicious management, they
                  are placed upon the list of civilized beings, and now, after long association, the
                  interests of master and slave are so closely connected, that disruption would
                  prove fatal to both Yet you would unsheathe the sword of destruction, and satiate
                  your evil passions upon an innocent and flourishing people, and impiously dare to
                  claim the sanction of the gospel for the blood-thirsty spirit that animates you—a
                  spirit that compares with its blessed truth as do the poisonous exhalations from
                  the charnel house to the pure breezes of heaven. In conclusion, Massachusetts, let
                  me advise you not to say a word in favor of this unholy strife; already do the
                  pages of history present your character to the world's gaze—blackened by the
                  persecution and murder of innocent victims. Have you quite forgotten the young
                  Indian nobles you sold as slaves? and your heartless massacre of the old men,
                  women and children? Do you remember nothing of the talented Gorton and his
                  companions, as chained hand to foot, you forced to work, thus maimed, through the
                  severity of winter, their helpless families given over to the mercy of savages?
                  Think of the innocent victims and the horrors of the 'Salem Witchcraft!" Oh,
                  hypocrite! you attempted to cover all of these enormities with the cloak of
                  religion, just as<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6177-00000064"/> you now do your
                  traitorous designs upon the South. First seek your own reformation—for once keep

               <p>As Malcolm Sterling left the stand he was met by several of his medical
                  companions, who extended their hands to him in cordial fellowship, and together
                  they left the hall.</p>
               <p>"See here, Malcolm," said Hadley, as they regained the street, "have you
                  discharged a sufficiency of caloric to prevent further explosion? Because I do not
                  feel like being blown up as you did those poor specimens of oratorship to-night.
                  Why did you not go round with your beaver, man, and raise a bank of quarters for
                  your Indian pets? Do you know I was in hopes you would propose to bring back the
                  wandering tribes and establish them here upon terms of equality—even with
                  'upper-tendom!' Oh, dear, it would be so nice to see some dainty, highly perfumed,
                  exquisitely exquisite parading Broadway with a buxom, greasy squaw hanging upon
                  his arm; and, again, some fashionable, fascinating graduate, from Madame Le
                  Frizee's, tripping behind her nude and majestic lord of the forest, with a
                  basketed pappoose strapped across her delicate shoulders. Oh, who will not say
                  this is the age for mighty improvements?"</p>
               <p>"Hush, Hadley, do," said Malcolm, laughing; "I do not feel good humored enough
                  to-night to enjoy your wit to the extent it deserves—so let's go home, and to
                  bed."</p>

               <p>"WHAT is it, daughter, that has brought a smile so full of hope to your face?"</p>
               <p>Ellen sat near the only window of their apartment, looking over a paper Terry had
                  given her. It sometimes happened that persons stopping at Hugh's shop, and having
                  the daily papers with them, after reading such news as interested them, would
                  throw the papers aside as worthless. In that way, Terry obtained quite an
                  assortment.</p>
               <p>"Oh, mother," said Ellen, in reply to Mrs. Layton's question, "here is an
                  advertisement for a governess to take charge of several small girls; the salary is
                  good—five dollars a month—that would pay our room rent and buy some little nice
                  things for you. I know I would please Mrs. Green—that is the name of the lady who
                  advertises—for I would be so devoted to the children, and if I could have her
                  consent to remain with you at night and on Sundays, it would be a nice
                  arrangement. Dear mother, may I not go at once, and see the lady?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Layton sighed. "Ah, poor child," said she, "you forget that you are a
                  stranger, and have no references; are poorly clad, and without friends to vouch
                  for your abilities to fill the station."</p>
               <p>"But she can try me surely, and if she is a sensible woman, will not value my
                  mental abilities any the less on account of my poor apparel. I feel so very
                  sanguine of success, mother, if you will consent for me to call on Mrs.
                  Green."</p>
               <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6177-00000065"/>
               <p>"Do as you wish, my child; I trust that you may not be disappointed."</p>
               <p>Ellen was soon attired in her best dark calico—a neat white collar relieved its
                  sombre hue; a plain straw bonnet, and faded shawl, completed her walking attire;
                  but the light of hope sparkled in her eyes and glowed upon her cheeks.</p>
               <p>"Now, darling," said she, kissing her mother's wan cheek, "keep up your spirits; I
                  will soon be back with good news."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Green lived in a fashionable street, and a considerable distance from Ellen's
                  miserable home in B—lane. She looked up timidly at the lofty marble residence,
                  with silver door-knobs and plate, upon which Mrs. Green's name was engraved; yet
                  hoping, trusting, she pulled the bell—quickly the door was opened by a waiter in
                  livery. He looked in surprise at Ellen, and did not condescend to speak, but stood
                  holding the door-knob in one hand, and running the fingers of the other through
                  his perfumed hair.</p>
               <p>"Is Mrs. Green at home?" Ellen inquired, in a scarcely audible voice; her courage
                  had almost forsaken her.</p>
               <p>"Wait," said the man. He closed the door, leaving her standing on the outside. In
                  a few moments he returned, and told Ellen, in a pompous tone, to follow him. She
                  did so, and was ushered into a spacious drawing-room, splendidly furnished. A
                  young lady of eighteen or twenty sat in a languishing attitude upon a crimson
                  damask-covered sofa. She stared with affected interest upon Ellen, as if she could
                  not imagine what kind of an unknown animal had appeared before her in calico, or
                  costume so entirely out of keeping with her own ideas of how everybody should
                  appear, who wished to be well thought of. An elderly lady sat in a rocking-chair,
                  corresponding with the damask sofa—she was engaged in reading. When Ellen appeared
                  at the door, she merely raised her eyes from her book, and scanned Ellen from head
                  to foot, then, turning her head in the direction where the footman stood,
                  said:</p>
               <p>"What does she want, Hodson?"</p>
               <p>The man replied, with a tittering laugh, "Don't know, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"I wish to see Mrs. Green," said Ellen, her cheeks flushed with indignation.</p>
               <p>"That is my name," said the lady in the rocking chair.</p>
               <p>"I noticed your advertisement for a governess, and called, supposing that I might
                  possibly obtain the situation."</p>
               <p>"By whom are you recommended?"</p>
               <p>"I am a stranger in the city, and have neither friends nor acquaintances to whom I
                  can refer you; but had I not felt myself competent to fill the office, I should
                  not have offered my services." Ellen's eyes flashed as she spoke, and her lip
                  quivered.</p>
               <p>"The opinion which you may have formed of your abilities, and that which I am
                  disposed to entertain, are very different, most probably. You must know that I
                  consider it extremely daring for you to suppose that I would employ a person in
                  your station to instruct my children; but if you are, as you say, a stranger in
                  the city, I must excuse you to some extent<pb n="130-131"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000066"/> for the woeful ignorance you manifest in presuming,
                  for a moment, that <emph>Mrs. Green</emph> would allow her daughters to associate,
                  in any way, with a person evidently from the lowest ranks in society. Hodson, show
                  this young woman out."</p>
               <p>As Ellen left the room, where she had not even been invited to take a seat, she
                  heard a burst of laughter from the two beings who disgraced the name of woman. The
                  footman opened the door wide, in pretended respect, and closed it against her with
                  a bang, almost before she had cleared the threshold. Poor disappointed,
                  heart-stricken Ellen!</p>

               <p>HOW little we know of the secret and mysterious influence that shapes the varied
                  scenes of our lives; we meet with an accident that seems the occurrence of a
                  moment, yet it is in truth but another link in the chain of events coeval with our
                  existence, and moulded by superior intelligence. When the heart is pure, and the
                  mind untrammelled by gilded mammon, the holy influence of this invisible power may
                  guide us on through life in blessedness.</p>
               <p>The morning after Malcolm Sterling's impromptu speech at the Republican hall, he
                  awakened with the feeling of resentment still rankling in his bosom, that had been
                  called forth by the false assertions heaped upon his beloved land, by an
                  unprincipled and traitorous party. Such feelings were repugnant to his nature
                  ture, and he determined, if possible, to recover his equanimity of temper. As
                  there were no college duties for the day, he concluded to stroll about the city,
                  with the hope that exercise would restore his lost good nature. One would have
                  supposed that Malcolm's business was of the most urgent nature, so rapidly did he
                  stride along—his pace, doubtless, keeping time with his excited thoughts.</p>
               <p>After walking for a couple of hours, he found himself near the residence of Miss
                  Sophia Green, a young lady with whom he had been acquainted some time; and he
                  concluded to make a short call. Mrs. Green, the young lady's mother, made great
                  pretensions to literature, and also considered herself a model philanthropist. She
                  always subscribed liberally where her name would be paraded before the public as a
                  person of great benevolence, but in private charity Mrs. Green was unknown. Miss.
                  Sophia was a duplicate of her mother, with the exception of being younger and
                  quite pretty. Her perceptions did not extend beyond dress, fashion, and coquetry.
                  These ladies were not persons in whose society Malcolm Sterling could take
                  pleasure, consequently he seldom visited them, and probably would not have thought
                  of calling at the time mentioned, had he not found himself unintentionally near
                  their house, and having nothing better to occupy his attention.</p>
               <p>Just as he reached the steps, the front door closed upon a young girl, who was
                  poorly clad, and seemed deeply distressed; her face was pale, and her little
                  gloveless hands clasped tightly over her heart, as if to keep it from bursting.
                  Tears fell from nor eyes, and<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6177-00000067"/> she
                  paused upon the threshold, seeming overcome by emotion. Malcolm drew near; his
                  step startled her, and she turned toward him for a moment. Quick as thought, his
                  harsh and irritated feelings were quelled; all thoughts of himself were lost in
                  the interest he at once felt for the unhappy girl before him. She gathered the
                  thread-bare shawl about her slight form, and as she passed, Malcolm bowed
                  respectfully. He could scarcely restrain the impulse that prompted him to follow
                  her, and crave the privilege of affording any needed assistance. "I dare not," he
                  thought; "perhaps she has cause to dread the sight of man, as an adder in her
                  pathway." He ascended the steps of Mrs. Green's fashionable mansion, and was
                  graciously received by the ladies.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Sterling," said Miss Sophia, "you should have come a little sooner—we
                  have had quite a farce."</p>
               <p>"Ah," said he, "and who were the performers?"</p>
               <p>"Mamma and one of the most doleful-looking creatures you perhaps ever saw."</p>
               <p>"Who was the sad-looking girl I saw upon the steps as I came in?" inquired
                  Malcolm.</p>
               <p>"That was the person I alluded to," replied Sophia.</p>
               <p>"Mamma was the girl's inquisitor; ask her for further particulars."</p>
               <p>"Sophia, do stop laughing, child, while I tell Mr. Sterling all about it," said
                  Mrs. Green, with mock gravity.</p>
               <p>Sophia hid her face affectedly behind her fan, and Mrs. Green continued:</p>
               <p>"Recently, Mr. Sterling, I advertised for a governess, to take charge of my little
                  girls, and the unfortunate-looking nate-looking person we are speaking of applied
                  for the situation. I was really insulted, and very angry at first, but after
                  learning she was a stranger in the city, I felt somewhat pacified, for, of course,
                  she was not aware of the vast difference in her position and that of my
                  family."</p>
               <p>"Did you ever hear of anything so ridiculous?" said Sophia, addressing Malcolm.
                  "Such a looking object applying for the situation of fashionable governess!"</p>
               <p>"What is her name?" said Malcolm. He thought of the poor girl's sweet,
                  grief-stricken face, and could scarcely conceal the disgust he felt toward the
                  heartless creatures who could ridicule the sufferings of their own race and
                  sex.</p>
               <p>"I did not inquire her name," said Mrs. Green, "as it was a matter of no
                  consequence to me, and I was anxious to get rid of her as speedily as possible,
                  for I strongly suspected she was some worthless character. We are unfortunately
                  surrounded, in this city, by great numbers of young girls who are utterly
                  destitute of all moral principle, and, unless very guarded, we are liable to be
                  imposed upon by them."</p>
               <p>"What a deplorable state of affairs!" exclaimed Malcolm; "calling loudly for
                  reformation. I am quite surprised some of the benevolent societies, so rife among
                  you, do not take the matter in hand—the Abolitionists, for instance. It would be
                  much better for them to straighten matters at home before they go abroad in search
                  of crooks in society."</p>
               <p>"Ah! you have just called to my mind an engagement which I am under, to attend a
                  meeting for the purpose of making up a purse to be presented to a very<pb
                     n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6177-00000068"/> pious and talented lady, who has a work
                  ready for publication that will greatly ameliorate the condition of the poor
                  blacks, for it is said to be the most touching narrative that ever has been
                  written. Now don't get angry, Mr. Sterling, for I do believe you are a good
                  Southerner, and, very probably, when the work to which I allude appears, you will
                  see slavery in its true light, and feel disposed to emancipate the poor
                  creatures."</p>
               <p>"It is not probable that I shall be affected in any other way than to feel disgust
                  at the falsehood and hypocrisy displayed by the author, if it is of the same stamp
                  as the anti-slavery speeches, which, it appears, are the popular entertainments of
                  the day with you here. I am disposed to doubt the piety of either male or female
                  who can pass by the crying wickedness and suffering that abound in this city, and,
                  for the sake of lucre, or popularity, boldly advocate sedition, rebellion, and
                  murder. Let me assure you, I could go South at this very time and obtain from the
                  slave population, as a free gift, from their own funds, a contribution amply
                  sufficient to furnish these poor outcast creatures the means of living honestly
                  Good morning, madam."</p>
               <p>"Mamma!" said Sophia, bursting into tears, as the door closed upon Malcolm
                  Sterling, "I never <emph>did</emph> hear anybody talk as much out of the way as
                  you do. I do believe Mr. Sterling has been here several times for the purpose of
                  offering himself to me, and you always commence with the 'negro subject,' and make
                  him mad."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! Sophia, stop your crying," said her affectionate mamma. "Mr. Sterling is
                  too much in love with you to be angry long. He is like all those hotheaded headed
                  Southerners, and will soon cool. One thing is certain, that if you marry him,
                  which is more than probable, I shall have not the slightest wish for
                     <emph>him</emph> to liberate <emph>his</emph> slaves. I anticipate seeing you
                  the mistress of a large plantation in the South. <emph>I</emph> know very well how
                  to manage matters all round;" and Mrs. Green nodded her head with a self-satisfied
                  air, and smiled complacently.</p>

                  great "beams" of suffering wretchedness that surround you. Then, and only then,
                  shall you see clearly the "motes" that may spot the fair face of our Southern
                  clime!</p>
               <p>With weary steps Ellen ascended the crazy stairs that led to their comfortless
                  apartment. She endeavored to hide from her mother the disappointment and insult to
                  which she had been subjected: laying the bundle of work upon the table without
                  speaking, she hastened to busy herself in preparing the evening meal.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Layton saw at once, that the noble girl had met with some additional cause
                  for unhappiness. "My daughter," said she, "do not weary yourself any more, just
                  now; come, rest and let me know what has occurred to trouble you so much. I had
                  but little hope that your efforts to better our situation would be of any avail,
                  and regret that I permitted you to make the attempt, which has probably caused you
                  to suffer insult from the proud and hard-hearted."</p>
               <p>Ellen hid her face upon her mother's bosom, that she might not see the tears
                  swelling to her eyes, and said:</p>
               <p>"They are wealthy and fashionable, mother; of course, I would not be a suitable
                  governess, for persons so far above me in society."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Layton sighed deeply, for she saw plainly that Ellen had been made to feel
                  her impoverished situation: "They may be above you in worldly gain, my precious
                  one, but in all the superior attributes of human nature, how far inferior!"</p>
               <p>"Don't sigh so sadly, mother," said Ellen tenderly, "let us keep in good spirits,
                  we shall yet hear from our friends in the South, I feel confident, and they will
                  want us to go back to our dear old sunshine home." Tears rained down Mrs. Layton's
                  cheeks as she pressed Ellen closer to her heart. She felt that she was truly going
                  rapidly to the home of everlasting sunshine; but Ellen, what would become of the
                  lonely, beautiful one! They sat long in the dim twilight folded in each other's
                  arms. Oh, shade of Horace Layton, did you draw near and whisper words of comfort
                  to the sorrowing mother and daughter, thus suffering through your unnatural
                  neglect!</p>

               <head>Chapter Forty-second.</head>
               <p>ABASEMENT room, or rather a cellar of the miserable building in which Mrs. Layton
                  and Ellen lived, was occupied by an old man called Rogers, who made a bare
                  subsistence by selling rags, which he picked up in the lanes and alleys about the
                  city. He appeared very infirm, and though clad in worn-out, and patched garments,
                  he had evidently known better days. His language was good, and his manner
                  gentlemanly. Ellen frequently met him at the pump, in the back yard, and sometimes
                  he appeared too feeble to lift his bucket<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6177-00000070"
                  /> after he had filled it. She would kindly assist him, and he was always deeply
                  affected by her attentions—tears starting to his mild gray eyes, as he looked on
                  her sweet face, and prayers for her welfare seemed ever upon his lips.</p>
               <p>On one occasion, as Ellen went to the pump for water, she noticed Nancy and Rose
                  lounging as usual at the back door. They sat upon the lowest steps, some distance
                  apart, and were whispering and laughing as if in possession of some very amusing
                  secret. Unsuspecting mischief, Ellen passed by them, but just as she was about
                  stepping to the ground, a rope line was jerked quickly before her feet, she sprang
                  lightly over it, and turning around saw Nancy and Rose holding the line by each
                  end. It had been carefully concealed below <unclear>the</unclear> as to escape the
                  observation of the intended victim, but Ellen had been too quick in her movements,
                  and the <emph>innocent</emph> creatures had not the satisfaction of tripping her
                  for their amusement, perhaps at the cost of her life. She filled her pitcher, and
                  was returning to the house, when she saw old Mr. Rogers descending the steps;
                  before she could warn him, the line was drawn across his path, and the poor old
                  man fell heavily upon the pavement. A loud shout from the wantons, testified their
                  satisfaction at the success of their stratagem that time. Mr. Rogers did not move
                  and Ellen ran to him and raised his head. She cried out in terror when she saw a
                  deep cut in one temple, from which the blood was flowing in a crimson stream over
                  his snowy hair. Mrs. Layton heard Ellen's cry of distress and was quickly by her
                  side. Hugh and his wife also were soon on the spot. Ellen at once told of the
                  girls throwing the old man down by a trip-trap. They, with the most perfect
                  composure, denied the accusation, and declared they were stretching a line in the
                  yard for the purpose of drying clothes, when Mr. Rogers had stumbled, and pulled
                  it down with him. Ellen looked with astonishment upon the girls, as they uttered
                  the barefaced falsehood.</p>
               <p>Hugh noticed her countenance, and was certain she had told the truth, but he did
                  not care a farthing for what the girls had done. He stepped near Ellen, and with a
                  defiant air said. "You will do well, miss, to tend your own business, and let my
                  girls alone: what they do on this place is no concern of yourn, and nobody is
                  agoin' to believe what you say."</p>
               <p>And Ellen knew it was really so; who in that great wicked city, would have faith
                  in a poor girl's word, or trouble themselves for an aged outcast? Mrs. Layton
                  bathed the old man's head with cold water, and he recovered somewhat from the
                  stunning effects of the blow. With Ellen's assistance she led him to his miserable
                  apartment, the cold damp cellar, where a few wisps of straw, and scanty ragged
                  covering, formed his bed, and entire stock of furniture. Mrs. Layton made a cup of
                  tea for Mr. Rogers, and was gratified to find, that from her own scanty share of
                  comforts, she could contribute toward bettering the condition of the poor old
                  creature.</p>
               <p>"Ah, dear madam," said he, "your kindness brings back to my memory, the time when
                  I had a comfortable home and a promising family. Where are they now? wife,
                  children, friends, all gone." The poor sufferer clasped his withered hands above
                  his snowy, blood-stained<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6177-00000071"/> stained head,
                  and closed his eyes in mute agony. Mrs. Layton was deeply affected, by the sad
                  spectacle of his wretchedness; her own sorrows were grievous indeed, yet she could
                  feel keenly for another's woe.</p>
               <p>"We must all die, Mr. Rogers," she said, "and those that have gone are at
                  rest."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes," said he, "and far more blessed than the survivors. My wife and daughter
                  have slept for twenty years in the quiet grave; for the same length of time my
                  noble boy has languished within the walls of a prison, and I crawl upon the earth,
                  a wretched outcast."</p>
               <p>"Your trials have been very great," said Mrs. Layton, with tearful eyes. "Is there
                  no hope of your son's release from confinement?"</p>
               <p>"Only by death," he replied. "My Henry, in a moment of frenzy, took the life of a
                  wretch who destroyed his sister's honor. My beautiful Emily fell a victim to the
                  seducer's wiles. Henry was then but eighteen years of age; his youth saved him
                  from the gallows, but to suffer the less merciful fate of a 'living tomb.'"</p>
               <p>Toward evening, Ellen called to see if Mr. Rogers needed any assistance. She found
                  him with fever, and talking incoherently. She informed Hugh of his situation, and
                  requested him to send for a physician.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I have had trouble enough with the old fellow already," was his reply. "I
                  don't feel like paying a doctor's bill to keep him here; he's old enough to die,
                  anyhow."</p>
               <p>Ellen turned away from the brutal creature with disgust. She was not acquainted
                  with any physician in the city, or she would have ventured to call one to the old
                  man's assistance. In this dilemma, Ellen watched for an opportunity to consult
                  with Terry, yet it was late in the night before she could find him disengaged. He
                  was sitting alone, when Ellen said, in a low voice:</p>
               <p>"What shall we do, Terry? I am afraid the poor old man will die, unless he has
                  some medical advice."</p>
               <p>"An it's every bit the truth, that yees talkin," said Terry. "The crather is bad
                  hurt, sure, but I can't be afther the docther yit, and must wait till Hugh, the
                  baste, is aslape."</p>
               <p>Twelve o'clock found Hugh and Phyllis snoring in harmony, and Rose and Nancy off
                  on their usual nocturnal rambles. Terry felt safe from detection by any of Hugh's
                  family, and he went, with rapid steps, in quest of a physician. With all his good
                  nature, Terry was one of the most unfortunate individuals in the world; as he
                  expressed it, "the divil always stepped on his toes, when he was afther doin'
                  good."</p>
               <p>He had proceeded but a short distance on his errand of charity, when he found
                  himself up to his waist in a hole filled with muddy water. A lamp-post had been
                  removed during the day, and a heavy rain beginning to fall before the workmen
                  could replace it, they carefully covered the pit for the night, but some
                  mischievous person had removed the boards. Terry called aloud for help, and the
                  "watch" came to his assistance.</p>
               <p>"Who goes there?" said he.</p>
               <p>"By me faith! an it's not me goin at all," said Terry, "but jist standin' here
                  like a pig in his illiment."</p>
               <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6177-00000072"/>
               <p>"Well, be off with you," said the watchman; "I suppose you're in liquor."</p>
               <p>"An yees altogether mistaken," replied Terry, "for if this aint mud, thin I niver
                  saw it; an I'm afther thinking if it was liquor, you'd be in it yerself."</p>
               <p>"Ah! sauciness, I know you now; Terry, isn't it?" said the watchman. "Give me your
                  hand, boy, and I'll help you out. How came you down in that hole?"</p>
               <p>"It's the divil's doins, someway, I don't know how. I was on me way for a docther,
                  to see a sick crather, an here I am.</p>
               <p>"Where will I find a good docther?" asked Terry of the watchman, after he had
                  assisted him out of his disagreeable predicament.</p>
               <p>"You will find Dr. Danely a good man, as well as a good physician; he lives on the
                  corner of Pearl street, in the gray stone house."</p>
               <p>Terry found the doctor's residence without further trouble. He had been detained
                  some time by his mishap, and knew that Ellen anxiously awaited him; but he hoped,
                  by the speed of his movements in returning, to make up for lost time. He pulled
                  the bell furiously. Dr. Danely had retired, but the hasty and repeated ringing of
                  the bell startled him quickly from his slumbers. He raised the window, and called
                  out:</p>
               <p>"Who is there?"</p>
               <p>"Me, yer honor," said Terry, "meself that's looking right up into yer beautiful
                  face, and can't see if it's black or white you be."</p>
               <p>"Who are you, and what do you want?" inquired the doctor.</p>
               <p>"I am Terry Loony, at yer service; an it's three years, next May, that I left my
                  old home in Ireland, an have been livin' that long wid the free nager Hugh—bad
                  luck to him for the way he thrates me. Me mither and three sisters is all dead of
                  the ship faver."</p>
               <p>"Well, what need is there of a physician if they are all dead?" said Dr.
                  Danely.</p>
               <p>"Arrah, botheration, yer honor, an' don't ye know they all died on the way across
                  the ocean, near three years ago. I want ye to go an' see a poor old
                  gintle-man."</p>
               <p>"You should have told me your errand at once, boy," said Dr. Danely; "wait a few
                  moments, and I will join you."</p>
               <p>"An' its myself that's a fool all the while, I live," was Terry's rejoinder,
                  speaking in a low voice to himself; "I am thinking of me own throubles till I
                  can't be sensible at all, at all."</p>
               <p>Dr. Danely found Mr. Rogers tossing restlessly upon his wretched bed, conscious
                  only of suffering. He remained in the same situation for several days, and when
                  the fever subsided was left hopelessly insane, from the severe injury the brain
                  had sustained by the fall. He was removed to the Insane Hospital to pass the
                  remainder of his miserable existence.</p>

               <head>Chapter Forty-third.</head>
               <p>WITH despairing anguish, Ellen saw that her mother was rapidly failing. Each day
                  she became more feeble, and the spasmodic attacks of pain about the heart were so
                  frequent as to prevent refreshing slumber. She could scarcely partake of the
                  plain, coarse fare—her daily allowance. Ellen entreated that she would seek
                  medical advice, but Mrs. Layton knew the rapid progress of her malady could not be
                  arrested, and she endeavored to reconcile Ellen to their approaching earthly
                  separation; but so great was the poor girl's distress, that with the hope of
                  consoling her in some degree, Mrs. Layton consented to see a physician. Ellen
                  called upon one, living in the adjoining street, and requested him to visit her
                  mother. His opinion confirmed Mrs. Layton's belief in the fatal nature of her
                  malady, and struck dismay to the heart of Ellen.</p>
               <p>"Oh, if she had some nice, nourishing food, I know that she would not be so
                  feeble," said Ellen, when telling Terry how very low her mother appeared.</p>
               <p>"Why not ask hilp from the benivolent society, Miss Ellen; I heard a man readin'
                  in the paper about it, and it tells that some nice ladies is goin' to take care of
                  poor, sufferin' crathers what be hard off in the world."</p>
               <p>"Where shall I go, Terry? and to whom apply for assistance? I will beg for my
                  mother's life."</p>
               <p>"Will, as to that, Miss Ellen, I can't tell; but I'll jist git a paper, an'ye can
                  read for yoursilf."</p>
               <p>Terry was faithful to his promise, and in a short time handed Ellen the
                     "<title>Daily Post</title>." She found a notice to the effect that poor,
                  deserving females would be supplied with necessary assistance by the society
                  called "Woman's Aid," No. 20 S—— street; a long list of ladies' names was
                  appended, who formed the philanthropic society. Ellen determined to go at once,
                  and heartily blessed the pious souls, who, she felt certain, in the plenitude of
                  their goodness, would assist her dying parent.</p>
               <p>"Mother, darling, can you spare me a short time to take a walk? you will hardly
                  miss me, before I shall be at your side again."</p>
               <p>"Go, my precious one, if you feel so disposed; the fresh air may benefit you; but,
                  daughter, do not go in search of more work than you already have engaged; I fear
                  that is your intention."</p>
               <p>Ellen smiled sadly, and shook her head. Mrs. Layton looked wistfully upon her as
                  she left the room, and sighed: "Dear, dear faithful child." She covered her eyes
                  with her thin, trembling hands, as if to shut out the view of woe impending ever
                  the desolate girl.</p>
               <p>Ellen walked rapidly to S—— street, and found the house without difficulty—a
                  large, comfortable-looking edifice.</p>
               <p>She rang the bell timidly; in answer to the summons, a middle-aged woman appeared,
                  clad in gray merino, with fur trimmings; she scanned Ellen narrowly before
                  inquiring her errand.</p>
               <p>"I have called to solicit assistance from the society of 'Woman's Aid.'"</p>
               <p>"Humph!" replied the woman, "just as I supposed;<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000074"/> come in, come in, don't keep me standing in the
                  cold to hear about your troubles."</p>
               <p>Ellen followed, with sinking hopes. She was ushered into a spacious room,
                  pleasantly warm; a cheerful fire glowed in the grate, and the floor was spread
                  with handsome carpeting. The kind-hearted ladies had been partaking of a lunch;
                  and empty wine-decanters, cake-plates, fruit-baskets, &amp;c., told they had
                  rendered ample justice to the tempting viands. In the centre of the room a large
                  table was covered with coarse materials to be made into garments for the
                     <emph>deserving poor.</emph> A tall, extremely slender lady, wearing
                  spectacles, presided at the head of the table, and answered to the name of "Sister
                  Sloe." She appeared about the same age as the sister in merino and fur. Her
                  countenance indicated considerable shrewdness; in fact, an inquisitorial energy,
                  that might have graced the "Secret Inquisition." She looked at Ellen keenly
                  through her spectacles, and then over their gold rims, as if to be certain she had
                  taken a correct view of the young, suffering face.</p>
               <p>Ellen stood trembling and abashed by the keen, harsh looks cast upon her. She
                  trembled with emotion, and placed her hands upon the the table by which she was
                  standing, for support. Several sewing implements happened to be near, which Mrs.
                  Sloe carefully removed, seeming apprehensive that Ellen's intention was to purloin
                  them if possible, and addressing her in a quick, sharp tone, said:</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"I read a notice in the '<title>Daily Post</title>' that distressed females would
                  here receive assistance," said Ellen, "and I called hoping to meet with aid for my
                  mother, who is very ill."</p>
               <p>"Do you bring a certificate from responsible persons to that effect?"</p>
               <p>"No, madam, there is no need of a certificate, for any one, by kindly calling upon
                  my mother, can at once discover her necessitous condition."</p>
               <p>"And are you so very simple, girl, as to suppose that we will run about to look
                  upon wretched objects? They are quite too numerous around our very doors. We
                  require the testimony, either written or verbal, of some respectable person, to
                  assure us that we are not imposed upon by the indolent and worthless; in truth, we
                  shall be compelled to call upon the police to protect us from the importunities of
                  the young beggar girls who line the streets; many of them really shocking to our
                  modesty, for the want of clothing to cover their nakedness."</p>
               <p>Stop, Mrs. Sloe! do not, for the sake of a Christiain community—<emph>do
                     not</emph> not assert anything so dreadful, <emph>unless it be strictly
                     true.</emph> If this state of wretched want and degradation exists to such a
                  fearful extent among your own race and sex, at <emph>your very door,</emph> too,
                  why do you not call on the <emph>reverend</emph> gentlemen and <emph>pious
                     ladies</emph> around you, who are sending scouts all over the Southern country,
                  where content and plenty abound, in search of suffering humanity? Call upon such
                  philanthropic persons in behalf of the poor, miserable masses in your midst, and
                  for the love of blessed charity, don't think of consigning them to the police, to
                  be punished, because they cry unto you for bread!</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6177-00000075"/>
               <p>"Madam," said Ellen, in reply to Mrs. Sloe's remarks concerning the indolent and
                  worthless, "my mother is now unable to work, and I can make but a scanty support
                  by sewing for the shops. All I ask of you is to furnish her with something
                  nourishing, and suited to her condition. She cannot partake of the plain, coarse
                  food, such as we have."</p>
               <p>"Are you not aware that hundreds upon hundreds, in this city, never have a full
                  meal a day, of 'plain, coarse food,' as you call good bread, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam, every day I see heart-rending want and suffering."</p>
               <p>"Yet you seem to think that <emph>your</emph> mother cannot exist on <emph>plain,
                     coarse</emph> fare! Ah, girl, I read your history in your face, the moment you
                  entered the room. Fallen! fallen!" Mrs. Sloe raised her hands deprecatingly as she
                  spoke. "I see, plainly, that you have once been in good society; it is indicated
                  by your correct language, and you are now reaping the <emph>just reward</emph> of
                  your sinful course; go, <emph>poor evil one!</emph> I am sorry to find that my own
                  sex can ever become so artful and depraved; but there are many, many
                     <emph>deserving</emph> creatures actually starving around us; we cannot deprive
                  them to encourage the guilty." Several sisters drew near Mrs. Sloe, as she
                  pronounced her anathema upon Ellen, and they held a short whispering conference.
                  Mrs. Sloe again spoke:</p>
               <p>"We have concluded to investigate your claim to <emph>benevolent</emph>
                  assistance. Give us the name and number of the street in which you reside, and if
                  your mother proves to be a <emph>deserving</emph> person we will aid her."</p>
               <p>"My mother is very, very low, and if she does not meet with immediate attention,
                  cannot long survive."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, I cannot help it," replied Mrs. Sloe. "We will not deviate from our
                  established rules in a single case. It is highly probable that you have caused
                  your mother to suffer greatly, by your own bad conduct, for I must say that I
                  strongly suspect you of being a very improper person."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, madam, I never intentionally did wrong in my life, and I would not give
                  my darling mother pain for the whole world; do not, oh, do not think so." Ellen's
                  hands were clasped in entreaty, and tears rained down her flushed cheeks.</p>
               <p>"You really terrify me, girl, by your impetuosity, and I augur still more
                  unfavorably of you, by your positive assertion of never having intentionally done
                  wrong. Were you to confess to us the errors of your life, we would be much more
                  charitably disposed toward you. Come, as a Christian, I beseech you to make a
                  clean breast of it; tell us how you have sinned, and we will lend you good books
                  to read—religious tracts—that will prove your lost condition to you, and the means
                  of rescue from Satan."</p>
               <p>The "Woman's Aid Society" gathered around Ellen, with the hope of hearing a
                  recital of sin and depravity. She turned a look of sorrow and disappointment upon
                  them, saying:</p>
               <p>"Do you think yourselves Christians? Then are you deceived. Go to the fountain of
                  all light, for you now wander in utter darkness."</p>
               <p>And Ellen left the house where a charitable association was assembled, not to aid
                  the suffering, but to gloat with fiendish exultation over the poor fallen ones,
                  and to extort histories of depravity from wretched, despairing<pb n="150-151"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000076"/> spairing creatures, by the bestowal of a coarse
                  garment or scanty meal. Such histories, to suit their vitiated tastes, as are the
                  manufactured horrors of Southern slavery. She looked up imploringly to the blue,
                  cloudless vault of heaven. Oh, how she longed to throw aside the weary, mortal
                  frame, and, hand-in-hand with her sainted mother, bound over space, and join the
                  dear ones who had gone before to the spirit-land.</p>

               <p>"WHAT low, moaning sound is that I hear, daughter?"</p>
               <p>"It is the sighing of the wind, mother; it blows directly from the South."</p>
               <p>"From the South! Oh darling, open the window and let me breathe the air once more
                  that comes from our old, loved home."</p>
               <p>The breeze blew fresh upon the fair, damp brow of the dying Mary, and seemed to
                  revive her for a short time. She drew Ellen to her bosom, saying:</p>
               <p>"My blessing! When I am gone, try to find your way-back to our dear Southern home.
                  Oh, child, how can I die and leave you here?"</p>
               <p>"Dearest mother, cease to grieve about me. Drink this nice tea—I was so careful in
                  making it nice. You will feel stronger after taking some nourishment." With
                  difficulty Mary swallowed a little, then seemed disposed to slumber. She appeared
                  to be free from pain, but breathed shorter every moment. How cold her hands were!
                  Ellen thought the fresh air had chilled her. She arose noiselessly and lowered the
                  window. When she returned to the bedside, her mother's eyes were raised to her
                  own, in undying love, then closed for ever. Poor, heart-broken Ellen clasped the
                  inanimate form as if she could never give it up. No blessed heart showers came to
                  her relief. She gazed with tearless eyes upon the calm, dead brow that no longer
                  wore the care-worn pall, and when she remembered that her mother should be arrayed
                  for the tomb, she prepared to discharge the last sad offices. She did not for a
                  moment think of asking assistance from the degraded, brutalized females in the
                  house. Gently she arranged the slender form and smoothed the soft brown hair; but
                  when at last she raised the little hands that had labored so faithfully through
                  life, her fortitude all gave way, and she fell lifeless beside her dead mother.
                  When she revived, Terry was standing beside the door, weeping bitterly. Ellen
                  started up in bewilderment, but soon the sad reality came fresh to her
                  recollection.</p>
               <p>"Heaven bless you, Terry," said she, "I can never forget your kindness to my
                  darling. Come and look upon her sweet face. She is in sorrow no longer, but gone
                  home, pure and spotless, as when fresh from the hands of her Maker."</p>
               <p>The kind-hearted boy looked earnestly upon the placid countenance of the gentle
                  friend who had so often encouraged him in the path of duty. His grief burst forth
                  with uncontrollable violence, and he rushed sobbing from the room.</p>
               <p>"What's the matter with you, sir?" said Hugh, who met the weeping boy descending
                  the stairs.</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6177-00000077"/>
               <p>"I jist stepped up to see the poor lady, but she's gone with the angels."</p>
               <p>"Dead, hey," replied Hugh, "that's lucky."</p>

               <p>"SO the woman up-stairs is dead," said Mr. Lance White to Hugh, the morning after
                  Mrs. Layton's decease.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Hugh, "and I ain't sorry; both of 'um put on too many genteel
                  notions for poor folks."</p>
               <p>"Come down in the world from a high place," said Mr. White, carelessly; "I guess
                  they have seen better days. How much are they in my debt?"</p>
               <p>"Three months' rent."</p>
               <p>"I can't afford to lose it; what does the stock of chattels amount to?"</p>
               <p>"Not half enough to pay the debt," said Hugh. "The girl owes me for two ounces of
                  tea, and a pound of sugar; I must have my pay also."</p>
               <p>"That's nothing more than right, Hugh, and a notion has just come into my head, by
                  following which, we can save ourselves. You know, sometimes dead folks will pay,
                  when the living cannot; do you take my notion?"</p>
               <p>"Guess so," said Hugh, scratching his head, as if to rake up his understanding;
                  "get a price over yonder;" he nodded his head in the direction of the medical
                  college, by way of explaining his term 'yonder.'</p>
               <p>"That's the very idea, Hugh; did any physician see her?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Dr. Braun called once. I asked him what ailed her, and he said her heart was
                  diseased."</p>
               <p>"Well, all you have to do, is to get a certificate from him, and take it to the
                  college; tell the persons you wish to bargain with, that the woman has left no
                  means to pay for burial—in fact, anything you please. There is no need of being
                  particular, so long as all seems fair; but don't let the girl know anything about
                  it; I have designs in that quarter, Hugh, and must be a little particular."</p>
               <p>"No need of that, Mr. White, for what can she do? She is here, and bound to stay
                  as long as you please; for my part, I shan't be a bit careful about lettin' her
                  know how poor folks are served here, for I owes her a grudge, any how; she's bin
                  too careful to keep away from my darters, jest as if they wasn't good company for
                  her."</p>
               <p>"Or anybody else. Well, Hugh, be patient; you will be up in the world when our
                  party gains the victory. You can then go South, if you choose, and live in style;
                  we shall have fortunes to give away—more land than we can cultivate, and the
                  country shall be thrown open to all the free blacks of the North."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm dreadful glad to hear it, and will be more than willin' to go when I
                  gets the chance,' cause I's tired of workin', and wants to rest—so does my wife
                  and darters."</p>
               <p>Hugh attended to the matter in consideration between Mr. White and himself. He
                  directed his wife to go and inform Ellen that he would attend to the burial of her
                  mother.</p>
               <p>"When and where will she be interred?" asked Ellen.</p>

               <p>"I don't know; some folks will come to-night and take her away," said the woman.
                  She leaned against the door-frame, and her eyes were half closed; she appeared as
                  if it was too much for her to remain awake long enough to hold a connected
                  discourse.</p>
               <p>"Take my mother away to-night," said Ellen, in a distressed voice; "will she have
                  no funeral?"</p>
               <p>"La, no, who's agoin' to pay the charges? You aint got nuttin', I guess."</p>
               <p>Ellen sighed and buried her face upon the bosom of the dead; she had not left the
                  side of the cot upon which her mother lay, during the long weary hours that had
                  elapsed since she breathed her last.</p>

               <p>TOWARD nightfall several coarse, low-bred looking men came unceremoniously into
                  Ellen's comfortless apartment, bearing a rude coffin. She shrank away from
                  observation—she could not endure to see her idolized mother handled by the
                  ruffian-looking group, who, with ill-timed jests, hurried the corpse into the box;
                  and she knew, by their retreating footsteps, that her only earthly treasure had
                  gone from her sight forever. The poor girl sat utterly prostrated by grief,
                  regardless of the gloomy darkness that surrounded her, or the low moaning of the
                  night wind that wailed through the gaping crevices, and seemed to chant around the
                  wretched dwelling a funeral dirge to all happiness. Ellen cast no thought upon the
                  hidden den future—her whole existence seemed absorbed by the great suffering she
                  then endured. The bell from the city-hall tolled hour after hour, but she heeded
                  not the lapse of time. At length a knock on the door aroused her, and Hugh
                  presented himself to her unwelcome gaze. He stood for a moment, looking at the
                  pale, upturned face, from which the light of all earthly hope had fled, then
                  advancing to the shelf, laid the lamp upon it, and asked Ellen if she would have a
                  cup of tea, or a bit of something to eat.</p>
               <p>"No, thank you," she replied. "I wish for nothing but to be alone."</p>
               <p>"Well, as to that," he said, "I may as well speak my business at once. Mr. Lance
                  White, the owner of this house, just now stepped into my shop, and bid me tell you
                  to stay here, and he will see that you want for nothing. He will call on you
                  directly himself."</p>
               <p>"Tell him not to come into my presence," cried Ellen, starting from her seat, and
                  a crimson flush of indignation dyed her face, as she remembered the insulting
                  language once addressed to her pure nature by the worthless creature. "Tell him
                  not to come, at his peril," she gasped hoarsely, as she thought of her lonely
                  situation.</p>
               <p>The man gave a low, insulting laugh, as he said:</p>
               <p>"I guess he can come to his own house, if he feels like it!"</p>
               <p>"Let me pass," said Ellen, moving toward the door, before which Hugh stood. "Let
                  me go to my mother's grave and die; it is my only wish."</p>
               <p>"You take on very foolish about your mother; everybody's got to die, and as to her
                  grave, I didn't know that she had any."</p>
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6177-00000079"/>
               <p>"How? What do you mean?" cried Ellen, an indefinable terror seeming to curdle the
                  life-blood in her veins.</p>
               <p>"Well, it means just this," said Hugh, "your mother owed Mr. White for room rent,
                  and she was owing me also. They give a good price round here, at the college, for
                  dead folks, so we sold her."</p>
               <p>Ellen rushed forward and grasped his arm, as if she doubted whether he was really
                  a living human being, or some hideous spectre. "Is it true?" she cried; "say,
                  monster, is it true?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure it is," he replied, doggedly, "What better is she than other dead poor
                  folks?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! let me go from this horrid place," cried the poor girl, wringing her hands in
                  agony; "let me go into the streets—anywhere but here."</p>
               <p>"My orders was for you to stay here, and stay you must," said the fiend, leaving
                  the room and locking the door after him.</p>
               <p>Ellen ran to the window, with the frenzied determination to throw herself from it.
                  The sash was fastened down, and her trembling, nerveless hands could scarcely have
                  moved a feather from her path. She sank upon the floor, crying "Mother, poor
                  sufferer, could you not find rest even in the grave?" With hands clasped in mute
                  despair, she seemed to await her threatened doom. Suddenly, a slight voice from
                  the low ceiling above attracted her attention. She looked up with indifference,
                  seeming scarcely conscious of danger; had death threatened her, she would not have
                  turned aside to avoid it. The plank moved slowly, then disappeared entirely.</p>
               <p>Quickly Ellen sprang to her feet, and stretched forth her hands in supplication,
                  as the broad, honest face of Terry appeared at the opening. He looked cautiously
                  around, and motioning silence, lowered a rope ladder, and reaching down his arm,
                  aided her to ascend.</p>
               <p>"Don't spake above a whisper," he said, "I know all."</p>
               <p>"Where have they taken my mother?" asked Ellen, in the same low tone of voice.</p>
               <p>"To the college," the replied, "and they have jist a bit ago gone with her."</p>
               <p>"I will go there, Terry," said Ellen; "they shall not mar my dear mother's
                  remains. Oh, my Heavenly Father! let it not be so," she cried, clasping her hands
                  with the wildest grief.</p>
               <p>"Well, ye had better go, Miss Ellen," said Terry, wiping the tears from his eyes;
                  "and where you're to find a home, God only knows. Bad luck to that nager down
                  stairs; jist see, will ye, when me two years is out, how I'll sarve the
                  baste."</p>
               <p>With stealthy steps the boy led the way, and Ellen followed closely behind him. At
                  the foot of the stairs he gathered an armful of wood, then opening the backdoor
                  softly, he whispered, "Now run as fast as ye can, ye know the way, jist round the
                  corner." He had scarcely closed the door upon her, when Hugh stalked into the
                  passage, calling out:</p>
               <p>"Terry, Terry, where are you, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Sure, and here I am, wid the wood ye sint me for,—where else should I be? Ye
                  niver let me git out of sight to me work, afore you're bawling Terry, Terry."</p>

               <head>Chapter Forty-seventh.</head>
               <p>ELLEN glided swiftly through the dark lane, in which she lived, and was soon amid
                  the throng, of brilliantly illuminated Broadway, but she passed on her way
                  unheeded; a sad young face was no strange sight there; ere long, she reached the
                  college ground, and with breathless haste ascended the broad stairway. The silence
                  of death seemed to reign throughout the building, and the apartments ranged on
                  each side of the hall, were in total darkness. An agony of dread filled. Ellen's
                  mind; "oh," she exclaimed, "I may be too late; perhaps, the horrid work has
                  already been accomplished. She stood for some moments undecided what course to
                  pursue, when, from a distance, a low murmuring sound fell upon her ear; she sprang
                  forward in the direction whence it proceeded, and discovered a narrow passage
                  leading to a large room, which was well lighted. A crowd of medical students had
                  just entered the room. The door was open. Ellen saw a shrouded form lying upon the
                  long table: "My mother," she cried, as bounding to the side of the dead, she
                  pressed the cold inanimate form to her bosom. In mute astonishment the assembled
                  students gazed upon her; she appeared as some beautiful being from another world
                  keeping guard over the loved remains, so noiseless and rapid had been her entrance
                  into the room, they were scarcely aware of her presence, till startled by her
                  agonized cry. She stood with her arms thrown over the dead mother, her lovely,
                  golden-brown hair had escaped from the bands that confined it, and fell in wavy
                  volumes around her pale cheeks and shoulders; and the deep blue, mournful eyes,
                  raised in tearful supplication, told a tale of woe, more eloquently than the
                  tongue could have uttered. There was one present who had seen that lovely girl
                  before. Malcolm Sterling recognized Ellen, as the young lady for whom his
                  sympathies had been so strongly enlisted, and whose sad face had never been absent
                  from his mind since meeting with her at the door of Mrs. Green's residence. He at
                  once perceived the trying position in which she was placed, and resolved to
                  befriend her.</p>
               <p>The professor of anatomy, Dr. Danely, was the first to interrupt the perfect
                  silence that prevailed for some moments after Ellen had entered the room; he
                  addressed the class of students, saying:</p>
               <p>"Young gentlemen, what does this mean? Has this subject been unlawfully
                  obtained?"</p>
               <p>He was made acquainted with the circumstances by a student that stood near him.
                  They spoke together in a low tone of voice; Ellen put a wrong construction upon
                  the whispered conference, and feared that the remains of her mother would yet be
                  desecrated, she held forth her hands imploringly toward them, saying:</p>
               <p>"Oh, sirs, I beseech you, spare my mother: for the sake of your own loved parents,
                  give her honored burial; I will spend my life in toil to repay you."</p>
               <p>"My poor child," said Dr. Danely, gently, "do not fear that the remains of your
                  mother will be any further molested. I sincerely regret this distressing
                  occurrence, and will render every assistance in my power toward a proper
                  observance of the burial rites. The body shall at once be conveyed back to your
                  home."</p>
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6177-00000081"/>
               <p>"I have no home," said Ellen, sorrowfully; "it is impossible for me to remain
                  beneath the roof from which I have this night escaped, by the kind assistance of a
                  poor Irish boy."</p>
               <p>"Have you no relatives or friends?" inquired kind Dr. Danely, as he looked with a
                  saddened countenance upon the desolated young creature, so beautiful, and
                  distressed, thus thrown upon the merciless world. Heaven bless the doctor; we
                  confess to great faith in the fraternity, and do firmly believe that, as a class,
                  they are the most benevolently disposed portion of humanity.</p>
               <p>Ellen informed him of her Southern origin, and spoke of the friends her mother had
                  left in the South, but from whom she had not heard in many years. She also
                  mentioned that, several months previous to her mother's death, she had written to
                  her Southern friends, informing them of the destitute condition in which she was
                  placed, but the letter remained unanswered. Before Ellen had ceased speaking,
                  Malcolm Sterling stood by her side, and addressing Dr. Danely, said:</p>
               <p>"I beg that you will allow me to take the obligation of attending to the last sad
                  offices for the dead, and the charge of this young lady upon myself. As children
                  of the same land, I consider these sacred duties to be exclusively mine, and I
                  shall assume the relationship of brother to the living and the dead. I trust," he
                  continued, turning to Ellen, "you will not object to consider me in that light,
                  until other friends may claim you?"</p>
               <p>Ellen bowed her head in grateful acknowledgment.</p>
               <p>"Hadley," said Malcolm, as arm-in-arm they walked to a distant part of the room,
                  "may I hope to obtain your mother's co-operation in my plan for this poor desolate
                  girl's welfare, and that she will receive her as a boarder? I know your mother to
                  be kind and Christianly; therefore, I make the request of her in preference to any
                  one of my acquaintance here."</p>
               <p>"I am confident that my mother will gladly befriend the unhappy girl; I will go at
                  once and consult with her."</p>
               <p>Dr. Danely dismissed his class for the evening, and with Malcolm remained by Ellen
                  awaiting Hadley's return. She sat beside her mother, holding the lifeless hands
                  within her own, and the low, deep sighs, that constantly escaped her lips, told
                  how nearly broken was the grief-laden heart. Hadley was not long absent; he
                  returned with a carriage for Ellen; his mother had cheerfully consented to receive
                  her. Malcolm noticed that Ellen was reluctant to leave her seat beside the dead,
                  and divined the cause: he told her the remains would be removed to the residence
                  of Mrs. Hadley, and he also requested to be informed of the name and age of her
                  mother.</p>

               <head>Chapter Forty-eighth.</head>
               <p>MALCOLM STERLING had the remains of Mrs. Layton placed in a handsome coffin; upon
                  the lid, a silver plate bore her name and age. In compliance with Ellen's earnest
                  request, her mother was laid beside Charlie. Poor orphan girl! her earthly ties
                  were all severed; side by side lay her misguided father and little martyr brother.
                  The open sepulchre awaited her mother—gone to the grave before half her allotted
                  space of years had been accomplished. To lonely Ellen the boon of life was
                  burdensome. With compassion, the venerable minister looked upon the drooping form
                  of the grief-stricken one, and his touchingly-eloquent address over the dead, was
                  so framed, as to fall soothingly upon her ear. Like healing balm to the torturing
                  wound, his comforting words calmed the bruised spirit. She knelt at the head of
                  her mother's grave, in humble prayer, and when the ceremonies had ended, left the
                  spot where her hopes of happiness lay buried, yet feeling resigned to the will of
                  an over-ruling Power.</p>
               <p>Ellen rode in the carriage with Mrs. Hadley; it was late when they reached the
                  city. Malcolm assisted them to alight; Ellen thought of all his noble kindness,
                  and extending her hand to him in adieu, tears fell from her eyes as she murmured,
                  "God bless you." Malcolm returned to his lodgings with a light step. The wealth of
                  the world was worthless, in his estimation, compared with the pious benediction of
                  the pure and gentle being who, from a heart overflowing with gratitude, so
                  earnestly bestowed it.</p>

               <p>HOME again, and here to stay, I hope, for I assure you, Harry, I am heartily tired
                  of roaming about with three restless children; dear little things, see how
                  rejoiced they are to use their poor, cramped limbs freely."</p>
               <p>The speaker was Mrs. Sterling, our little Annie Wallace. She had been absent from
                  home for many months; business of importance had required Mr. Sterling's presence
                  in Cuba, and his family accompanied him. Their return home had been delayed many
                  months, owing to the prevalence of yellow fever in New Orleans, through which they
                  were compelled to pass, and they remained with Annie's uncle in Florida until late
                  in the fall.</p>
               <p>The old homestead was but little changed in appearance. With the peculiarity of
                  Southerners in general, Annie loved old customs, and though the house had been
                  newly painted, the furniture and domestic arrangements were in the same state as
                  when sweet Mary Danville presided as mistress of the comfortable mansion. Annie
                  had reached something over thirty years, and was a handsome, pleasant matron,
                  possessing the same generous, affectionate nature, characteristic of her
                  childhood.</p>
               <p>The village post-office was at "Wallace Landing." Soon after reaching home, Harry
                  Sterling stepped over to the office for news; upon his return, he handed Annie a
                  letter, saying:</p>
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6177-00000083"/>
               <p>"Here is a letter that seems to have been making diligent search for you: first
                  here, then to Cuba and Florida, now back again one week in advance of us."</p>
               <p>Annie looked earnestly at the direction, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"It is Cousin Mary's writing. Oh, I am so much rejoiced to hear from her again.
                  What can have caused her strange silence? She broke the seal, and read eagerly; in
                  a short time she was weeping.</p>
               <p>"Why, Annie, my dear wife, why are you so greatly distressed?"</p>
               <p>"Finish reading it for me, Harry, I cannot command my feelings sufficiently. Poor
                  darling, how she has suffered, and is now dying in want."</p>
               <p>Harry Stirling read aloud the balance of the letter. Mary told the cause of her
                  long silence; the tragical deaths of Charlie and her husband; Parson Blake's
                  diabolical proceedings; yet but little of her own misery; for Ellen, she besought
                  Annie's loving kindness.</p>
               <p>"What shall we do, Harry? Oh, if they were but here, how tenderly I would care for
                  dear Mary; and poor little Ellen, to think that she may now be alone, and in
                  poverty; the idea is distracting."</p>
               <p>"Do not be so much distressed wife; I hope we shall be enabled to assist your
                  friends in time to prevent further suffering from their necessitous condition. You
                  perceive she has never received the letter you wrote, informing her of your
                  father's donation, of which it appears she was in entire ignorance. That villain,
                  Parson Blake, doubtless intercepted it, and for aught we know to the contrary, may
                  have managed in some way to draw the amount from bank. I must make immediate
                  mediate inquiries, and you had better write at once to Mrs. Layton, and send
                  assistance."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Annie, "and tell them to come home without delay; but if Mary is so
                  low in health that she cannot travel, we must go to her, Harry, and cheer her up.
                  Never again shall Mary or her child know want, so long as I have wealth to share
                  with them."</p>
               <p>"So do, Annie, you are a noble soul. What wonder is it that every day increases my
                  love for you, when such endearing virtues are constantly unfolding in your
                  character."</p>

               <p>ELLEN was sitting in the neat room provided for her by the kindness of Mrs.
                  Hadley, engaged in embroidery. She had insisted upon immediate employment, and
                  Mrs. Hadley thought it would be best for her mind to be occupied in any way that
                  might serve to divert her thoughts from her mother's sad fate. A servant came to
                  the door, and told Ellen an Irish boy was below stairs, who wished to see her.</p>
               <p>"It is Terry," she exclaimed; "how good he is to call and see me." She descended
                  to the front door, and found that she was not mistaken, Terry was anxiously
                  awaiting her appearance.</p>
               <p>"An' Miss Ellen," said he, "I just lost me way on purpose to see you, and know for
                  sure that you're doin' well. I wint the very night you was missin from old<pb

                  had got a nice home; the Doctor told me as much, an' its mesilf that's proud to
                  see you livin' like a lady that you be, ivery inch of you." Mrs. Hadley came into
                  the entry where Ellen and Terry were standing.</p>
               <p>"This is Terry, the good boy, Mrs. Hadley, who was so kind to mother and myself.
                  You have heard me speak of him," said Ellen. Mrs. Hadley shook hands with him, and
                  insisted upon his taking a seat with Ellen and herself, in the parlor.</p>
               <p>"How long will it be before your engagement with the man Hugh expires?" asked Mrs.
                  Hadley of Terry.</p>
               <p>"I am to stay a whole year yit wid the baste, mam, an' it most brakes me heart,
                  since the good lady died an' Miss Ellen's gone; but I aint so main as ter want
                  thim back a bit, but jist lonely like, an' can't git along wid the nagers, at all.
                  Ye see Hugh thinks I hilped Miss Ellen and her things off, an' its the baste that
                  aint a bit mistakin."</p>
               <p>"You did a praiseworthy act in assisting Miss Layton to escape, Terry, and she
                  feels greatly indebted to you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Terry," said Ellen, "I often find myself wishing that I had it in my power
                  to be of service to you."</p>
               <p>"Don't talk of sich a thing, Miss Ellen, I'm grateful for all the 'couragemint ye

               <p>"You spoke of having helped my things off, Terry. What do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Why, ye see, a little while after you got away that night, Misther Lance White
                  coomed along and found ye missin', as I expected he would. Hugh, the baste, was
                  afther me right off, as knowin' all about it. Sis I, 'an' be jabers how am I know,
                  at all, at all; there's but one winder; if she jumped out, dead she is, sure, down
                  in the strate; the door is locked, an' the key in yer pocket. Now, sis I, ye
                  stupid botheration, how could I git Her off?' He up wid his fist to knock me over,
                  but I jumped aside, an' he got the lick himself, for his fist coomed bang upon the
                  counter. Well, ye see, he didn't think to look overhead, away inter one corner of
                  yer room—so he give the divil all the credit, afther he thought me clear. Misther
                  White give strong talk, 'cause he thought Hugh had fooled him. 'Twas late whin he
                  left. Hugh wint off to bed, and was soon snorin' wid the rist of his family; so up
                  I wint, inter the garrit, and down inter yer room again. Sis I to mesilf, 'Miss
                  Ellen's things, and the nice leddy what's gone, isn't for thim fray nagers;' so I
                  made bold to open your little trunks and took all the things out, for ye see there
                  wasn't much, no way, an' I put them into the pillow-cases—books, sewing things,
                  an' all—an' up agin I wint with me plunder. That time I made sure to cover the
                  loose board over with rubbish, to keep Hugh from 'specting anything. Next, down I
                  wint into the cellar, where old gintleman Rogers stayed, an' I raked up his straw
                  bed to cover over your things, in the corner. They be safe there, sure, for them
                  nagers is afraid to go about the cellar—the villains. They say poor old Misther
                  Rogers' sperit comes out of his body to pester them, whiniver they go about the
                  cellar, an' ye can sind an' git them jist when it suits ye; but don't let the fray
                  nagers know who cared for them."</p>
               <p>"Terry, I can never repay you for all your thoughtful<pb n="168-169"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000085"/> ful kindness. Though we had little of value, what
                  my mother left—her books especially—are very precious to me."</p>
               <p>"That's jist what I thought, Miss Ellen, an' I was none too quick in hidin' them,
                  for in the morning, whin thim lazy louts was up, the first thing they did was to
                  run up inter yer room, to sarch; and whin they found the trunks empty, down they
                  come to me, sayin' I knowed all about the matter. 'Hist,' sis I, 'ye dirty,
                  thavin' villains, an' don't ye know the room was locked, an' yer own father, bad
                  luck to him, had the kay in his pocket? An' isn't it the faries that's not goin'
                  to lit such as ye to be afther stainin' a nice young lady's trimmings?' An' I told
                  'em I heard a step, late at night, going up stairs and comin; down, and saw a
                  light burnin' in your room, and a sperit goin' up through the sealing, with white
                  bags on his back. The gals said I was afoolin' thim, and they didn't belave in
                  sperits. Jist then old Lucy stepped up, an' sis she: 'Who's that don't belave in
                  sperits? Don't you say that agin gals, for ye know I always did belave in
                  sperits.' 'Yes,' sis I, 'that's jist what I'm thinkin' whin I sees yer swallerin'
                  whiskey;' an' I got out of her reach soon, for she was afther murtherin' me. An'
                  now I must find me way back, an' it's sorrowful I feel about that same."</p>
               <p>"I really wish that we could be of service to you, Terry, but until your time of
                  engagement has expired with the man Hugh, we cannot materially benefit you," said
                  Mrs. Hadley. She had been greatly amused, and also interested, by his
                  conversation, and felt solicitous for his welfare.</p>
               <p>Ellen was resolved that if she ever obtained a situation tion that afforded her an
                  opportunity, she would endeavor to better poor Terry's condition. With that hope,
                  and the desire to repay the obligations, to some extent, under which she was
                  placed to the kind friends who had so faithfully befriended her in the time of
                  need, her whole being seemed absorbed.</p>

               <p>WITH the delicacy of a refined nature, Malcolm Sterling did not call on Ellen
                  until business matters required that he should do so. He felt that she would be
                  embarrassed in his presence, believing herself to be under heavy obligations to
                  him, and he respected her great sorrow. It was of a nature too sacred to be
                  interrupted by the presence of a stranger, ere time had lent its healing influence
                  in soothing the stricken spirit. Yet scarcely a day passed that he did not bestow
                  some mark of delicate attention upon the bereaved girl. He selected books, and
                  marked passages that he thought calculated to interest her, and every morning sent
                  a fresh bouquet for her toilet. Ellen did not cast away the withered flowers, but
                  she placed them with her treasures. She valued everything that came from the hand
                  of one who had paid the last honors to her beloved parent.</p>
               <p>Ellen seldom left her room. She felt no disposition to participate in social
                  communication, though to Mrs. Hadley she never wearied of speaking in praise of
                     her<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6177-00000086"/> mother's endearing virtues. She
                  had been living with Mrs. Hadley several weeks, when she received a letter
                  directed to her mother. She knew before breaking the seal from whom it came, for
                  she had often seen Annie's writing, and she wept when thinking how the dear
                  sufferer for whom it was intended would have rejoiced over the generous and
                  affectionate sentiments expressed by Annie. "Too late, too late," was her
                  distressed cry, as she read the urgent request for Mary to return South
                  immediately. Bank bills to a considerable amount were enclosed—sufficient to
                  defray the expenses that had been incurred, and an ample surplus. Ellen thought of
                  the many comforts by which her mother would have been surrounded, had Annie only
                  learned of her distressed situation at an earlier period. It was several days
                  before she could control her emotions of grief sufficiently to return an answer to
                  the kind and faithful friends who were so solicitous for her return to them.</p>
               <p>Ellen wrote to Malcolm, expressing her gratitude for his generous conduct, and
                  requested him to defray, with the sum enclosed, all expenses that were due him,
                  and also requested that he would have monuments placed above the graves of her
                  parents and little brother. Malcolm had already placed tombs above the
                     "<emph>three martyrs</emph>," at his own expense, but he did not mention having
                  done so. He returned more than half the amount Ellen had sent him.</p>
               <p>Ellen hoped that she had it in her power to aid Terry, and one morning as Hadley
                  was on the point of leaving the breakfast-room, she inquired if she might take the
                  liberty of requesting a favor of him.</p>
               <p>"Most assuredly, Miss Layton," was his reply, and returning to a seat, awaited her
                  wishes.</p>
               <p>"I am so anxious to aid Terry," said she, "in some way, yet cannot imagine how it
                  can be done. He is bound to the negro Hugh, and is most shamefully treated. It
                  would be of little avail to give Terry money."</p>
               <p>"I can probably devise some plan." replied Hadley.</p>
               <p>"That fellow Hugh has already committed crimes enough to hang him, if he met with
                  his dues; but he is protected by men in responsible situations, and goes clear
                  from deserved punishment. He loves money, yet is too lazy to work for it. I think
                  twenty dollars or so would release Terry from his engagement with the worthless
                  creature, and when clear, he can meet with a good situation. My mother has taken
                  quite a fancy to the boy, and if he wishes, she will hire him."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am certain," replied Ellen, "that Terry would be rejoiced to live here,
                  your mother is so kind to every one. Be so good as to make any arrangement you
                  think best; my purse is at your command for Terry's release."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter Fifty-second.</head>
               <p>"COME, Malcolm, let us take a walk; I have a commission from Miss Layton, with
                  which I am anxious to succeed, for though I am aware that she only called on me
                  because you were not at hand, yet I<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6177-00000087"/> am
                  anxious to have some claim upon her good opinion. How I do covet the position of
                  the handsome, dark-eyed 'Dr. Malcolm Sterling.'"</p>
               <p>"And what may that position be?" said Malcolm, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Why, self-elected guardian to one of the loveliest girls in the universe. Heigho!
                  I wonder if there is not a similar piece of lovable nature somewhere for poor
                  Hadley?"</p>
               <p>"I hope so, really, Hadley, and you may rest assured that you have already secured
                  a high place in Miss Layton's estimation by your kindness, for though I have never
                  met with her except under trying circumstances, I am convinced that she is
                  possessed of a refined and sensitive nature, and can well appreciate your many
                  noble qualities."</p>
               <p>"And," said Hadley, "the dear little creature seems as if she could never be
                  grateful enough for the least act of kindness; it appears her lot has, for some
                  time, been cast amid a set of ravening wolves; she has, unfortunately, tested the
                     <emph>virtues</emph> of those <emph>devilites,</emph> the abolitionists."</p>
               <p>Malcolm laughed heartily at Hadley's fancy name for the fashionable
                     <emph>puritans,</emph> and said:</p>
               <p>"Well, Hadley, I protest every suspicion that I might have entertained concerning
                  the justice of slavery in the Southern States has vanished before the disclosures
                  of vice, oppression, and misery in every shape, that I constantly behold in this
                  very hot-bed of abolitionism. I have made it my business to investigate the
                  matter, because I wished to compare notes, and see how far we were behind in
                  civilizing the negro race."</p>
               <p>"And you find," said Hadley, "the negroes here are far below the negroes of the
                  South in every respect. I know it to be so. My mother has many relatives living in
                  the South, and she often visits them; to her I am indebted for a correct idea of
                  negro servitude among the Southerners; but here we are in B—lane. Now for some of
                  the glories of New-York charity—look there." He pointed to a group of girls
                  varying from ten to sixteen, white and negroes, half naked, and miserable in
                  appearance beyond description. They were setting on the steps and standing around
                  the door of the wretched building in which they lived; some were quarrelling,
                  others laughing at obscene jests. As the young gentlemen attracted their notice,
                  they ran forward, crying:</p>
               <p>"Give me a cent—pray, do, sir; I have not had a mouthful to-day. Give me, give
                  me," cried a dozen voices at once. The young men scattered small change among the
                  wretched creatures, and turned away in pity and disgust, shocked by the oaths and
                  blasphemy hurled at one another by the girls; some had snatched more money than
                  others, and the victors were abused and abusing.</p>
               <p>"I cannot describe my distress at such sights of depravity," said Malcolm.</p>
               <p>"You will see sights of a similar nature, and even worse, by roaming through any
                  alley in the city; but it would be a dangerous adventure. Numbers of these poor
                  wretches are ready to plunder or murder at any time."</p>
               <p>"Where shall we find Hugh's establishment?" asked Malcolm, "I am really sick of
                  this filthy lane."</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6177-00000088"/>
               <p>"Murder! murder!" The cry sounded a short distance from Malcolm and Hadley. They
                  ran in the direction whence the cry came, and sprang over the low fence of a back
                  yard. A huge, ragged negro fellow was beating a famished-looking white woman.</p>
               <p>"Desist, you scoundrel!" exclaimed the gentlemen, as they ran forward and rescued
                  the almost murdered woman from the infuriated monster's grasp.</p>
               <p>"Lemmy go, and tend to your own business," he said, as Malcolm seized his arm.</p>
               <p>"How dare you beat that poor woman? You shall go before a magistrate, and answer
                  for your brutality."</p>
               <p>"I told her to get up and go out a beggin', for I ain't got nothin' to eat, and
                  she made out she couldn't walk, so I jest gave her a good thrashing to hurry her
                  up."</p>
               <p>"I cannot walk or work, I am too ill and weak; all I crave now, is to lie down and
                  die in peace."</p>
               <p>"Let's take her to the hospital, Hadley, she is really in a dying condition."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, if you please, kind sirs, take me there, don't leave me here to die like
                  a brute. I was not always so vile; indeed, indeed, I was not."</p>
               <p>They led her from the yard, and Hadley soon procured a hack for the suffering
                  woman; he directed the driver where to take her.</p>
               <p>"Now," said Malcolm, "let us get an officer, and have that fellow arrested."</p>
               <p>"I would willingly do so, Malcolm, if it would be of the least avail. Such
                  occurrences are so frequent here, that they pass unheeded by the law. The murder
                  of a poor woman or man here is a matter of no consequence sequence; but had that
                  black wretch purloined a dime from a rich man, he would have gone to the
                  penitentiary for it. Oh, I tell you this city is a very 'Sodom.'" They walked on
                  for some time in silence; at length Malcolm exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Where in the world is the variety establishment of gentleman Hugh. Oh, I dare say
                  this is the very place. See, here is an apple, a ginger-cake, and a plug of
                  tobacco in the window, to indicate a choice selection of luxuries."</p>
               <p>They entered the shop; a duplicate of the belligerent African was lying upon the
                  counter, snoring in regular measure, notwithstanding a loud altercation was going
                  on between the females of his family, sufficient to have disturbed the slumbers of
                  any one less accustomed to their noisy disputes. The young gentlemen rapped loudly
                  with their walking-canes upon the door; at last Terry appeared, he knew who they
                  were, and was delighted to see them.</p>
               <p>"We have called, at Miss Layton's request, to see if we could purchase your
                  release from that sleeping animal on the counter." Hadley spoke in a low tone.</p>
               <p>"Well, its mesilf that would be the best plased if ye can do it, an' blessin's
                  besides that I'll be calling down upon ye and beautiful Miss Ellen. It's money
                  that will get me away from Hugh, the baste; he loves it sure."</p>
               <p>"Wake him up, and we will try to make arrangements with his lordship," said
                  Hadley.</p>
               <p>Terry filled a dipper with water, and stepping to Hugh's side, said:</p>
               <p>"This is the way to wake the crather, bad luck to<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000089"/> him." He dashed the water with force into the
                  sleeper's face. Hugh started up, and looked around in stupid surprise. Seeing the
                  gentlemen, he dismounted from the counter and wiped his face. He seemed in no way
                  disturbed by the waking process, otherwise than to be awakened.</p>
               <p>"We have called to hire this boy from you—"</p>
               <p>"He can't go," said Hugh, interrupting Hadley.</p>
               <p>"He's bound to me for a year longer, an' is got to stay; if he is a lazy dog."</p>
               <p>"Mesilf lazy, is it ye're saying?" said Terry. "An' who does the work then? Who
                  washes for you an' the old woman, an' gals too, whiniver you have any clain
                  clothes, an' cooks besides?"</p>
               <p>"Well, you do help the old woman and the gals some, that's a fact, for they can't
                  work hard. They don't take natural to it, an' it hurts their feelin's. You see,
                  gentlemen, my women is all the proud sort—they can't come down in the low way, to
                  mean work; an' ever since the strong talk about takin' the South for the colored
                  people, we is all got out of patience 'bout stayin' here at all, an' don't feel
                  like doin' nuthin'. I suppose you gentlemen belong to <emph>the party?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Most certainly," said Hadley, with a sly wink at Malcolm. "Do you know, Hugh, who
                  they are going to put forward for the Presidency? I was not out on the last
                  meeting night."</p>
               <p>"No. I couldn't learn <emph>'zactly;</emph> but I heard 'em say any sort of a
                  publican would do."</p>
               <p>"Black Republican, I suppose you mean," said Hadley. "That's fine news; but Hugh I
                  have a nation to set forth your claims for the office. Now I can't see why you
                  will not answer for a Black Republican president, as well as any of the other
                  members."</p>
               <p>"That's just what I've been thinkin' myself, an' when we git down yonder South,
                  I'll have some bold pulls for it—see if I don't. My darters then won't have to
                  work themselves to death, but can dress as fine as fiddles."</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said Hadley, with affected seriousness.</p>
               <p>"But concerning this Irish boy. I really wish that you would let me have him,
                  Hugh. Name your price for releasing him. I have no doubt that you can be better
                  suited at the House of Refuge"</p>
               <p>"Well, I guess so too; but it's a sight of trouble to walk way down there. But for
                  twenty-five dollars I may be accommodating. That's about what Terry's worth to me,
                  taking in the trouble of looking for another servant."</p>
               <p>"Here is your money, but I must have a written agreement," said Hadley.</p>
               <p>Hugh wrote the agreement after his own fashion.</p>
               <p>He was an <emph>educated New-York colored gentleman,</emph> and signed his name.
                  Terry was to leave that very day.</p>

               <p>MRS. HADLEY sent for Ellen's trunks, and the servant was told to bring the amount
                  due Hugh, for room rent, and a few articles that Ellen had purchased during her
                  mother's illness. She wished to settle with him immediately. The servant was
                  informed that the contents of the trunks had disappeared mysteriously; he insisted
                  upon going to the room, saying he would have the trunks, "empty or full." Terry
                  led the way up stairs; Rose and Nancy followed from idle curiosity; to their utter
                  consternation, every missing article had been replaced, and the servant carried
                  the trunks in triumph to his cart.</p>
               <p>"Ah, ye see, now," said Terry to the girls; "that I told you the truth when I said
                  the fairies had the nice young lady's things, ye disbelieving, lazy hathens."</p>
               <p>The girls were too much astonished to answer. They did not for a moment dream that
                  sly Terry had replaced the articles on the night previously. Hugh was equally
                  mystified, and came to the conclusion of his wife and daughters, that the house
                  was haunted.</p>
               <p>Terry was like a blithe humming-bird, so happy was be when making preparations for
                  his departure; his sole stock of wearing apparel was tied up in a
                  pocket-handkerchief, his hair was nicely straightened, and his face shining from
                  the repeated application of soap-suds to make it fair and neat: he was ready to
                  depart from the delightful sanctum of Hugh Jackson, and bundle in hand, he stepped
                  to the door of the shop. The ambitious proprietor was smoking an unfragrant
                  Havana, and probably dreaming of future grandeur and a still more blessed state of
                  indolence, when Terry appeared.</p>
               <p>"Presint me respects to the ladies," said he; "an Mister Hugh whin ye nixt cage
                  birds for 'old White,' look for loose boards overhead;" he placed his finger
                  beside his nose and winked slyly, then disappeared before Hugh really comprehended
                  his meaning. When he suspected fully what Terry meant, he rushed up to the garret,
                  and found, sure enough, the broad, loose board, that had served so good a purpose
                  under Terry's guidance. He also discovered the rope-ladder—and the whole mystery
                  of Ellen's escape, and the disappearance and return of her few treasures were
                  explained.</p>

               <p>ELLEN wrote to Annie, expressing her wish to return South; yet when her thoughts
                  dwelt upon the dear ones in the little willow wood, she longed to be there too;
                  she felt as if leaving everything dear to her upon earth; but again the sweet
                  assurance that tell from her mother's lips, when speaking of leaving Charlie's
                  grave, came soothingly to her recollection. "Yes," she murmured: "They can come to
                  me upon the wings of undying love."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Sterling, wishes to see Miss Layton," said a servant to Ellen, as she sat in
                  her pleasant little chamber reading some exquisite passages in an admired work
                  which Malcolm had sent her. She descended immediately to the parlor; it was the
                  first time she had met<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6177-00000091"/> Malcolm since
                  her mother's funeral; he advanced to meet Ellen, his handsome face expressing the
                  pleasure he felt in seeing her: she extended her hand in heartfelt cordiality.</p>
               <p>"I have received a letter from the South, Miss Layton," said he, which informs me
                  that I have a right to claim relationship with you. My uncle, Harry Sterling, is
                  the husband of your cousin Annie."</p>
               <p>Ellen smiled at the idea of the distant relationship, and said: "Your kindness,
                  Mr. Sterling, to me, has been such as a brother would have bestowed, and I rejoice
                  indeed to find that we are members of the same family though but distantly
                  related."</p>
               <p>"My uncle has written to me, requesting that I would call on you, and ascertain
                  your determination with regard to returning South; he will come on for you at any
                  time you wish: he also enclosed a thousand dollars to be delivered to you, which
                  is drawn from your own funds in the Bank of New-Orleans. You are probably ignorant
                  of the fact, that Major Wallace, many years ago, placed a sum of money in bank,
                  for the benefit of your mother and her children. The amount was to draw interest
                  for fifteen years, and then be divided between the heirs. It seems your parents
                  must have been unacquainted with this matter, or they would surely have paid some
                  attention to it. Uncle wrote to your mother when the time specified had expired,
                  to learn her wishes with regard to the money, but no answer was returned, and he
                  says, in his letter to me, he is now convinced from what your mother wrote, that
                  she never received the letter; it was probably intercepted by the man Parson
                  Blake, who seems to have been the evil genius of your family."</p>
               <p>"He was, indeed," said Ellen, sorrowfully, "and oh, how much misery his wicked
                  conduct has caused."</p>
               <p>"He must have been a complete fiend. I have heard of him as a thorough-going
                  abolitionist, and doubt not he is a fair specimen of the party in general."</p>
               <p>"I must confess," said Ellen, "I have not formed a favorable opinion of their
                  philanthropy; from childhood I have lived in their midst, and never saw persons
                  more disposed to oppress the unfortunate."</p>
               <p>"And I shall return South," replied Malcolm, "convinced, that nowhere is there
                  less poverty and oppression, than in our own beloved land." He arose to take
                  leave, and with evident emotion said:</p>
               <p>"I am rejoiced that your old friends have proved faithful, but hope you will not
                  cast my friendship aside as worthless."</p>
               <p>Ellen clasped his offered hand within both of her own,—she raised her tearful eyes
                  to his earnest gaze, and said in a calm, low voice:</p>
               <p>"Sleeping or waking, those blessed words seem ever present, that came to my
                  despairing heart like a voice from Heaven: 'Brother to the living and dead.'"</p>

               <head>Chapter Fifty-fifth.</head>
               <p>IT was not in the nature of Ellen's grateful heart to forget any one who had ever
                  bestowed a kindness upon her. She often thought of the unhappy girl, Miss Land,
                  and determined to make some attempt toward reclaiming her from the wretched life
                  she led. She wrote an affectionate and touching letter, in which she thanked Miss
                  Land for so nobly saving her from the vile wanton's plot, and begged her to
                  abandon the house and seek elsewhere an honorable livelihood. Ellen promised every
                  assistance within her means; she named the direction of her Southern home, and
                  told Miss Land, at any time she stood in need of aid to call upon her for it. She
                  intrusted the letter, and a purse containing a considerable amount, to Terry, who
                  had promised to find a way for delivering them to Miss Land, and after some
                  trouble, he succeeded. He went to the kitchen door at Madame Frivoli's, and
                  knocked for admittance. Terry begged that he might come in and get a morsel for
                  supper; he hoped to have an opportunity of conversing with the cook, and offering
                  her a reward to devise some plan for him to see Miss Land, but the woman shut the
                  door impatiently upon him, saying "there was no victuals to spare in that place."
                  Terry was not disposed to be vanquished, and was at the kitchen door the next
                  night. The woman recognized him, and supposing begging to be again his object, she
                  was about to close the door upon him, when Terry sprang forward, saying:</p>
               <p>"Hist, ye ill-mannered crather, an don't ye want to make some honest money, for
                  yer own pocket?"</p>
               <p>Terry's words acted like a charm. She opened the door wide for him to enter, and
                  then led him to the kitchen. She then stepped cautiously to the passage, and
                  listened for some time attentively. When she returned to the kitchen, she appeared
                  satisfied with her investigation, and inquired his business.</p>
               <p>"Can I spake with Miss Land a minit?"</p>
               <p>"I guess not," said the woman; "the girls have watchers."</p>
               <p>"Name your price for cheating 'em jist one minit," said Terry. The woman thought
                  earnestly for a short time, and then said:</p>
               <p>"Come to-morrow night at this hour. I may have Miss Land here to see you; I shall
                  try, any way, and if I succeed, must have five dollars for my trouble."</p>
               <p>"I'm agreed," said Terry, and he departed with a light heart.</p>
               <p>The next night found him in madam's kitchen. Miss Land quickly joined him. Terry
                  handed the letter and purse sent by Ellen. Miss Land read eagerly, and appeared
                  much affected. When she had finished reading, she tore a slip of paper from it,
                  and wrote:</p>

               <p>ELLEN had walked out to make some necessary purchases. Upon her return she was
                  informed that a strange gentleman wished to see her. When she entered the parlor,
                  Mrs. Hadley was in conversation with a fine-looking man in the prime of life, who
                  had introduced himself as Harry Sterling. He came forward to meet Ellen with the
                  utmost kindness of manner, saying:</p>
               <p>"Your cousin Annie is all anxiety to see you, and gave me a number of messages to
                  deliver concerning the care you were to take of yourself in travelling, etc., but
                  I believe they have got mislaid in my memory, so I will substitute my own care of
                  you, in place of the messages."</p>
               <p>Ellen smiled and thanked him. She saw that he was a good-humored, generous-hearted
                  man, and her heart glowed with grateful emotions. By how many kind friends she was
                  surrounded. She could scarcely believe the sudden change real, from extreme want
                  to the possession of every comfort. Mrs. Hadley had treated Ellen with the
                  greatest tenderness, and disliked the idea of giving her up, and Ellen regretted
                  leaving one who had been a second mother; her thoughts, too, lingered with the
                  loved dead, but when she remembered how fervently her mother had prayed that her
                  orphan girl might be restored to her Southern friends, she rejoiced that the
                  desired wish was to be accomplished.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sterling was anxious to return home at an early period, and after paying a
                  last visit to the graves in the little willow wood, Ellen was ready to accompany
                  him. When in the neighborhood where poor old Margery resided, Ellen called to
                  thank her for the kindness she had bestowed upon her in childhood. The old woman
                  was delighted to see her little pet, and when she learned of Ellen's changed
                  situation, wept for joy. Ellen bestowed a handsome sum upon her, sufficient to
                  supply her with many needed comforts, for perhaps the balance of her life.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter Fifty-seventh.</head>
               <p>THE carriage was at the door, in readiness to convey Ellen to the cars. She was
                  deeply distressed. Mrs. Hadley pressed her again and again to her heart. Hadley's
                  lip quivered as he said "good-by," and poor They sobbed as if his heart would
                  break. Malcolm handed Ellen to the carriage. "We shall meet again," he said,
                  softly, as he held her hand for a moment in a gentle clasp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harry Sterling endeavored, by the varied powers of amusement in his
                  possession, to dispel Ellen's melancholy. He was very lively and intelligent; it
                  was hardly possible to be in his company without feeling entertained, and
                  gradually Ellen was withdrawn from communing with her great sorrow, to taking
                  pleasure in society. She was charmed by the beautiful scenery along the road, and
                  Mr. Sterling had ever ready some illustrative anecdote, when they passed any place
                     of<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6177-00000094"/> note. A few days' rapid
                  travelling, and Ellen again breathed the balmy air of her native land.</p>
               <p>"We shall soon be at home now, Ellen," said Harry Sterling, as he stepped to the
                  door of the ladies' cabin. They had been several hours on the Mississippi, aboard
                  of a fine steamer. "Come," he continued, "and watch with me for a first glimpse of
                  the old homestead."</p>
               <p>The boat seemed to fly through the waters; beautiful orange groves appeared and
                  vanished, like magic.</p>
               <p>"Now, Helen, when we round the next point you will see, peeping through the trees,
                  the very old, white-faced mansion in which my home treasures dwell." Harry
                  Sterling's face was glowing with pleasure at the anticipated family reunion. On,
                  on flew the steamer; the bell sounded a merry peal. "There," exclaimed Harry,
                  joyfully, "there comes Annie with the children, Mollie, Henry, and Charley. They
                  are all well, thank God!" He waved his handkerchief; Annie took the youngest boy
                  in her arms, and he held out his little hands toward the boat. Soon the loving
                  ones were together, and Ellen was folded to Annie's generous bosom.</p>
               <p>"Little Miss Ellen's come back, a beautiful, grown young lady." Such was the
                  intelligence carried from one negro to another over the plantation. Quickly a
                  dusky host assembled to look upon "Miss Mary's" daughter. Old, snowy-headed Peter,
                  one-armed Jack, all welcomed the wanderer back, and neighbors and friends vied
                  with each other in bestowing courteous greeting upon one of their own land, who
                  had found so many sorrows in an uncharitable clime. Oh! how grateful was the
                  beautiful orphan for the affectionate attentions so freely bestowed upon her.</p>

               <p>"WELL, I declare, Malcolm is a strange fellow; where was I expecting him to spend
                  the next three months with me, and he writes that he intends making a tour through
                  the Northern States, and will be absent all the summer. He is determined to become
                  acquainted with the condition of the poor classes of the entire Northern States,
                  and intends comparing notes with the South upon his return. Ha, ha, that Malcolm
                  is a thorough-going fellow; there is no such thing as fooling him, and the
                  abolitionists will find that he is well acquainted with their policy. Upon his
                  return he will publish his travels, and I doubt not we shall have something rich,
                  also truthful, for Malcolm is true as steel; he is no monomaniacal sycophant,
                  shedding crocodile tears over imaginary woes, and passing by real suffering with
                  stoical indifference." "What do you think of Malcolm, Ellen?" continued Harry, as
                  he noticed that she listened with artless attention to his conversation.</p>
               <p>"I have formed so high an opinion of him, that I do not think I can express it; he
                  is certainly most noble and generous."</p>
               <p>"There," said Harry, with a smile of satisfaction, "Ellen is the girl of a
                  million; how many fashionable misses can you find who would so truthfully express
                  an opinion of an interesting young gentleman."</p>

               <p>Ellen colored slightly, and said, "Perhaps I should not have expressed my opinion
                  so candidly, if Mr. Sterling's bearing toward me had been less like that of a kind
                  brother."</p>
               <p>"Well, this brotherly love is very apt to change into something more love-like,"
                  said Harry. "I thought my affection for Annie was that of brother when we first
                  met, and told her so, but she took it in high dudgeon, and I was forced to confess
                  a more tender attachment."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you wicked Harry," said Annie, laughing, "how can you tell stories with so
                  much composure; I don't think Malcolm bears any resemblance to you in his
                  truth-telling propensities."</p>
               <p>"There it is, Ellen," replied Harry, with pretended displeasure; "you see how she
                  abuses me, and I am forced to take my gun and slaughter squirrels, by way of
                  appeasing my wrath." He threw his game-bag over his shoulder as he spoke, took his
                  gun, whistled for his dog, pinched Annie's cheeks, and was off.</p>
               <p>"I do think he is the best man that ever lived," said Annie, as she looked after
                  him until he could no longer be seen.</p>

               <head>Chapter Fifty-ninth.</head>
               <p>IT was little Charlie Sterling's birth-day; he was to have a frolic and a nice
                  supper spread upon a rustic table beneath the orange trees in the grove; Ellen was
                  to be mistress of ceremonies—she was always pleased to gratify the little ones,
                  and enter into their amusements; she gathered flowers to adorn the table, and
                  picked oranges fresh from the trees. Suddenly, the children gave a shout of joy,
                  and, taking her basket, she hastened to join them. Exercise had brought a high
                  glow to her cheeks, and her beautiful eyes sparkled with delight at the idea of
                  the gratification she was affording to the little ones.</p>
               <p>"How exquisitely lovely," thought Malcolm Sterling, as he looked upon her. He
                  stood beneath the shade of a large oak, and Ellen was quite near before she
                  observed him.</p>
               <p>"I hope I am not an unwelcome guest," said Malcolm, as, advancing to her side, he
                  took the basket of oranges and placed them upon the table.</p>
               <p>"Oh no, indeed," said Ellen, and a smile sprang to her lips as she spoke. "We have
                  been expecting you for some time; Cousin Harry has grumbled considerably at your
                  delay. How have you enjoyed your tour?"</p>
               <p>"I can hardly tell yet; I have travelled so fast, and been engaged most of the
                  time in taking notes, everything seems yet in a whirl. I shall have to straighten
                  things a little in my mind before I can tell whether I was most pleased or pained
                  by the varied scenes."</p>
               <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6177-00000096"/>
               <p>Ellen inquired concerning Mrs. Hadley, her son, and Terry.</p>
               <p>"They were all well when I left," replied Malcolm. "Hadley, however, declared he
                  was afraid of falling into evil ways, as you were not there to prevent it."</p>
               <p>"Why," said Ellen, in surprise, "how did I influence him; we seldom conversed, and
                  I am quite certain that I never saw him commit a censurable action; I particularly
                  admired his devotion to his mother."</p>
               <p>"Well, he said that he repented of his sins regularly three times a day, at
                  breakfast, dinner, and tea—in fact whenever he saw your innocent little face."</p>
               <p>Ellen laughed. "It is to be hoped then," said she, "that he will quickly meet with
                  some one, whose looks he likes equally well, if it is essential to his good
                  behavier; yet, I must repeat, I had formed a very high opinion of Mr. Hadley's
                  character."</p>
               <p>"You were not mistaken in doing so; Hadley is a noble fellow. I really—"</p>
               <p>"Why, Malcolm, how do you do? how very glad I am to see you; where in the world
                  have you been all this time?" Annie had just learned of his arrival, and hastening
                  to greet him, plied questions without mercy.</p>
               <p>"It will be right hard to tell where I have not been in the United States, Auntie;
                  however, you shall hear all about it when I am somewhat recovered from my fatigue.
                  Where is Uncle Harry?"</p>
               <p>"Hunting, as usual," said Annie, somewhat pettishly. "I declare it is sinful to
                  kill so many poor squirrels as Harry does, when we have so much to eat around
                  us."</p>
               <p>"I was under the impression that you thought it impossible for Uncle Harry to do
                  wrong."</p>
               <p>"Oh, well he does nothing else that is the least out of the way."</p>
               <p>"Then don't interfere with his hunting, Auntie, for I have heard it said that
                  every man has some pet sin, and if you put a stop to his squirrel-hunting, he may
                  take up something much worse."</p>
               <p>"No danger of Harry's doing anything very wrong," said Annie, confidently.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter Sixtieth.</head>
               <p>THOUGH Malcolm Sterling was possessed of an independent fortune, he had no wish to
                  lead an indolent life, and selected the medical profession, in preference to
                  attending the farming business of his estate; he had a trusty agent employed for
                  that purpose, and devoted his time to his favorite pursuits and studies. His
                  intellectual faculties were finely developed, and his moral attributes
                  unexceptionable. From early youth he had been devoted to literature, and head
                  never evinced the least disposition to form the evanescent attachments too apt to
                  mislead youth into the fatal error of desecrating the most sacred emotion of the
                  soul—pure, hallowed love, the precious and immortal gift of Deity—that assimilates
                  the nature of man to that of his Maker. When Malcolm unexpectedly met Ellen, for
                  the first time he experienced the soul-longing for a kindred nature. It was not
                  her beauty that so mysteriously moved him; her suffering countenance, almost
                  deathly in its pallor, could scarcely have attracted<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000097"/> tracted attention otherwise than in commiseration
                  for evident distress, and his heart throbbed in sympathy as he looked upon the
                  mourning young face. Several succeeding interviews were alike characterized by
                  distressing circumstances, yet did Malcolm feel that the lonely girl was
                  inexpressibly dear to him; in the deep recesses of his great, manly heart, her
                  image was enshrined; the most precious gift that Heaven could bestow upon him. It
                  was when he met Ellen in the South, after time had mellowed her grief, the roses
                  of health bloomed upon her cheeks, and the light of a hopeful nature glowed in her
                  deep, blue eyes, that he was fully conscious of her loveliness. Ellen, in
                  disposition, greatly resembled her gifted mother, possessing the rare combination
                  of a sensitive, affectionate nature, united with firmness and self-reliance; her
                  countenance, faithfully mirroring mental alternations, was ever charming—sometimes
                  bright with glad smiles, then sad, as the memory of sorrowful scenes and trials
                  came, like clouds overshadowing the glowing face of the sun; her form was light
                  and graceful, slightly above the medium height.</p>
               <p>Toward Malcolm, Ellen's bearing was that of a devoted sister. Neither time nor
                  circumstances could ever efface the cherished remembrance of his disinterested
                  generosity, at a time when she stood alone and unprotected; surrounded by
                  circumstances, that, to a nature less pure than his, would have condemned her, she
                  was ever ready to add to his happiness by any means in his power; she would read
                  to him, or sing his favorite songs, stroll through pleasant walks, or to any wish
                  that he expressed cheerfully accede. Malcolm believed that Ellen was actuated
                  entirely by emotions of gratitude; he regretted that it was so; he craved her
                  love—a similar immortal passion to that which glowed in his bosom for her; he did
                  not doubt Ellen's consent, should he ask her to become his wife, yet he felt that
                  her decision would be based upon her fancied weight of obligations, and he was by
                  far too unselfish in his love to wish for a moment that she should unite her fate
                  with his own unless convinced that he was the chosen of her heart. Each day that
                  he passed with Ellen but served to strengthen his belief in her sisterly
                  affection, and to increase his own ardent attachment; she ever met him with a
                  sweet, confiding look; no timid blush mantled her cheek when he took his seat at
                  her side, or gently drew her little hand through his arm for a walk. Malcolm would
                  sigh as he thought, "She will never love me as I wish."</p>
               <p>Upon one occasion, at the breakfast-table, Malcolm and Annie were discussing the
                  merits of a new work. Harry Sterling called upon Ellen for her opinion; she
                  expressed herself delighted with the book, excepting several passages, of which
                  she so much disapproved, as to avoid reading them—the sentiments expressed caused
                  her to feel unhappy. Shortly after, they were sitting upon the beautifully shaded
                  gallery—Annie sewing, Malcolm moody and abstracted, and Ellen looking over the
                  late paper for news—suddenly, Malcolm started from his recumbent posture, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Ellen, will you be so obliging as to read those objectionable passages in the
                  book we were discussing just now?"</p>
               <p>Ellen arose, without the slighest hesitation, and got<pb n="194-195"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000098"/> the book; she found the required passages, and
                  prepared to read, but Malcolm stepped hastily to her side, and, taking the book
                  from her, he threw it upon the table and abruptly left the house.</p>
               <p>"Well, really," said Annie, as she looked upon him in surprise, "I do believe
                  Malcolm is crazy."</p>
               <p>"Why, what's the matter?" said Harry, who had been with the children to the
                  orchard for fruit, and returned in time to hear her remark.</p>
               <p>"Matter enough, truly. In the first place, Malcolm was so rude as to request Ellen
                  to read something that he heard her say she did not like, and just as she was
                  about to read, he snatched the book from her, threw it on the table, and stalked
                  off with the rudeness of a Hottentot. I don't think he has been any more benefited
                  by his trip North than was Uncle Peter."</p>
               <p>Harry laughed heartily. "Oh, pshaw!" said he. "Don't be angry with Malcolm; 'tis
                  Ellen's work, every bit of it; he has doubtless popped the question and met with a
                  rebuff."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed," replied Ellen, blushing deeply, "I dare say, no such idea has ever
                  entered Mr. Sterling's mind."</p>
               <p>Pity Malcolm was not there to witness the deep blushes that dyed Ellen's cheeks,
                  at the mere hint of his love for her. Poor Malcolm found a retired spot, and mused
                  despairingly. It distressed him to see Ellen so unselfishly yield to his wishes;
                  and he had purposely asked her to do what she had expressed as distasteful to her,
                  hoping she would evince some reluctance in complying with his request, he should
                  then feel assured that if he asked her to become his wife, she would not consent
                  unless influenced by love alone.</p>
               <p>Ellen had no disposition to feel annoyed or to laugh at Malcolm's unusual conduct.
                  She was certain that something had occurred to distress him, and was greatly
                  relieved when, at dinner, he appeared with his usual cheerfulness.</p>

               <head>Chapter Sixty-first.</head>
               <p>SO We are to have the Governor and his suite took spend several days with us.
                  Annie, what have you rare and nice for the table?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing very rare, Harry; but what we usually have is quite nice enough. Yet if
                  you wish your guests to fare better, you must supply the articles."</p>
               <p>"Well, I can bring forth, by the crack of my rifle, deer, wild turkeys, squirrels,
                  &amp;c. Now, Malcolm, I move that you take a pirogue and run up the bayous for
                  fish and trout. We can then set a table equal to that of the St. Charles, for his
                  excellency."</p>
               <p>"Agreed," said Malcolm. "The morning is fine for both hunting and fishing. We
                  shall doubtless be very successful."</p>
               <p>Harry sounded his bugle, and the hounds were directly yelping for the chase.
                  Malcolm loosened the pirogue from its moorings, and it danced upon the mighty
                  waters like a thing imbued with life-joyousness. He sprang into it, and a few
                  strokes of the paddle carried him forward into the swift current leading to the
                  bayous. Ellen was standing upon the upper gallery. Malcolm saw her; he waved his
                  cap gracefully<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6177-00000099"/> in adieu. For a moment
                  Ellen's snowy 'kerchief floated in reply upon the breeze. The pirogue shot around
                  a sudden bend in the river and was out of sight. Ellen sighed. She could not tell
                  the cause of an oppression and loneliness that suddenly overcame her. Annie's
                  merry voice recalled her to self-possession.</p>
               <p>"Come, Ellen, dear, let us do our best in the pastry line. We must have pies,
                  custards, jellies, and what not. You know Harry is very particular in his notions
                  of how company should be entertained. Oh, dear, I do wish he was a little more
                  'don't care' in his disposition. He is too proud; that's his only fault."</p>
               <p>"You forget his hunting propensities, cousin," said Ellen, archly.</p>
               <p>Annie laughed. "Well, take him pride and hunting if you please, and he will
                  compare with the most excellent."</p>
               <p>So, in making good things, and arranging the house, time passed rapidly with Ellen
                  and Annie. The day had been clear, until late in the afternoon, when the sky
                  became rapidly overcast. Black clouds hung low and threatened heavy rain. Distant
                  thunder sounded gloomily to those who had friends exposed to the approaching
                  storm. Ellen hastened to the upper gallery to watch for the pirogue. Rain was
                  descending in torrents. She could scarcely see half way across the river, and the
                  roaring winds and angry waves that lashed the shore filled her heart with dread.
                  She could not remove her anxious gaze from the raging waters. Suddenly her
                  attention was fixed upon a dark object that arose with the waves, then was lost to
                  sight by the receding motion. Again it appeared, and much nearer. Ellen discovered
                  it to be Malcolm's pirogue, which was coming rapidly to shore, but his best
                  efforts were required to keep it clear of the drift-wood which was descending the
                  river in enormous masses. It had ceased raining, measurably, and Malcolm could
                  plainly be seen urging his frail bark forward. He had almost cleared the
                  drift-wood, when, by a heavy, swelling wave, a huge log was driven upon the
                  pirogue, and it was overturned. In breathless terror Ellen gazed upon the spot
                  where she had seen Malcolm sink. Quickly he arose to the surface of the waters,
                  and clung with one arm to a drifting log; the other arm seemed disable. Ellen
                  rushed to Annie's room, crying—</p>
               <p>"Malcolm is drowning," and ran to the yard in search of help. The men belonging to
                  the plantation, with the exception of old Peter, were all at the quarter, a full
                  half mile distant. Annie, distractedly called upon the house-women to hasten for
                  them, and joined Ellen who had already loosened the skiff, and looked to see if
                  help was at hand; old Peter was at her side quickly.</p>
               <p>"My old arms can yet row a skiff, if I had a hand to steer for me," he said, as he
                  looked back and saw that no assistance was near.</p>
               <p>"I will steer it, Uncle Peter," said Ellen. "Oh, pray let us hasten, Malcolm is
                  surely injured and cannot assist himself in this terrible flood."</p>
               <p>"Oh, child, come back," Annie cried, as she saw Ellen step with undaunted courage
                  into the skiff; "come back Ellen, what can you do?"</p>
               <p>"I can aid in saving Malcolm, or die with him," said Ellen firmly.</p>
               <p>Annie saw that expostulation was useless; she threw<pb n="198-199"
                     xml:id="VAC6177-00000100"/> a blanket around Ellen, and stood weeping as the
                  skiff receded from the shore.</p>
               <p>Uncle Peter pulled with his might; the wind was against them, and the skiff seemed
                  scarcely to advance toward the drifting log to which poor Malcolm clung; but, at
                  length a temporary change favored the movements of the skiff, and the old man bent
                  to the oars with fresh courage.</p>
               <p>"Steer below the log, missy, we'll soon be up to it now." Ellen kept her eyes
                  fixed upon the clinging form. She could see Malcolm's deadly face; the waves broke
                  over him, again and again, hiding him from view.</p>
               <p>"Now, now, Uncle Peter, row swiftly—the log will pass us." Thank God! the skiff
                  came directly against it. Uncle Peter seized Malcolm around the waist and lifted
                  him aboard. Ellen folded the blanket around him, gently as if he had been an
                  infant, and supported his head against her bosom; he seemed scarcely conscious of
                  existence and lay with closed eyes and fitful breathing. Ellen wiped the chilling
                  moisture from his brow and held his cold hands within her own: ere long, he
                  recovered to a sense of his situation, and looked gratefully upon Ellen's sweet
                  face—oh, the returning glance he met, bore <emph>even more than a sister's
                     love.</emph> Swiftly the skiff glided homeward; Uncle Peter's oars were
                  scarcely needed, the breezes blew stoutly for the shore; a hundred dusky forms
                  were in waiting, and Harry, too, all drenched with rain had come in from the
                  chase; he heard of the disaster before dismounting and rode up to his horse's neck
                  in the foaming surge to watch the returning skiff. Thoughtful Ellen, waved her
                  handkerchief to assure the anxious multitude of Malcolm's safety, and Harry
                  shouted "Safe, safe," to Annie, who was upon the gallery in an agony of distress.
                  Soon the skiff bounded to the shore. The carriage was in readiness for Ellen and
                  Malcolm.</p>
               <p>"Peter," said Harry, as he wrung the old man's hand, "will you accept of your
                  freedom and comfortable support, for the balance of your life?"</p>
               <p>"Bless de Lord, Master Harry, I'm free enough, and have all I can wish for."</p>
               <p>"Well, Peter, if there is a request you can make of me or mine, rest assured it
                  shall be granted."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Master Harry; I have lived in disworld to be near seventy, and never
                  yet, hab my white folks let me want for anything"</p>

               <p>MALCOLM had received a severe contusion upon one arm by the force with which the
                  log had been driven upon him: he was unable to leave the room for several days,
                  and the distinguished guests left "Wallace homestead," before he had
                  recovered.</p>
               <p>Ellen was standing near an open window in the drawing-room, looking sorrowfully
                  upon the seared and withered leaves that Autumn with unsparing hand had scattered
                  from the drooping branches. Insensibly, a feeling of melancholy stole over her;
                  the scene recalled the withered hopes of her childhood, and tears moistened the
                  long dark fringes of the snowy eyelids, that closed for a moment as if to shut
                  within the sacred cells of<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6177-00000101"/> memory the
                  never-to-be-forgotten sorrows of early life; a quick step attracted her attention,
                  she turned, and Malcolm stood by her side; he clasped her extended hand.</p>
               <p>"Ellen," said he, with emotion, "I owe you my life, and you risked your own to
                  save it; but your magnanimity did not surprise me, for you appear to think you can
                  never repay the obligations which circumstances placed in my power to bestow;
                  sacred obligations, Ellen, which it became my bounden duty to perform, and which
                  have been long since cancelled by your sisterly devotion to me. It has pained me
                  to find you so ready to gratify my most simple wish, for I have feared that should
                  I crave the greatest of earthly happiness, and ask you to become my wife, you
                  would consent, even at the sacrifice of your own happiness."</p>
               <p>"Sacrifice of my happiness!" exclaimed Ellen, in surprise, and she raised her blue
                  eyes wonderingly to his face.</p>
               <p>"Do you love me, Ellen?"</p>
               <p>"More than my life."</p>

               <p>"HO! Hadley, remember your promise to be my attendant at the altar, should I be so
                  fortunate as to win the loveliest of her sex, my own Ellen. Now come, boy, mount
                  the cars, and down with you. I have selected a sweet little lady to flirt with
                  you; she is to be one of Ellen's bridesmaids; Chloe Medow is her name, a creole
                  beauty and belle. I described you to her; the merry cricket declared you were the
                  identical individual who had haunted her dreams for the last two years; she is now
                  sixteen. Be here by Christmas. We shall be married during the week following."</p>
               <p>Thus wrote Malcolm to his friend in New-York.</p>
               <p>And Hadley fulfilled his promise. He was received by Harry and Annie as an old
                  friend—according to Southern custom, considered a member of the family. Hadley was
                  charmed with the household—the children particularly; he protested he never saw
                  such pretty, winning little creatures. Malcolm wished that Hadley should see
                  something of Southern life during his visit. It was the season for holidays among
                  the negroes—weddings, quiltings, and merry-makings of every description, were in
                  operation. Hadley was present at many of them; he looked with astonishment upon
                  the loaded tables, filled to overflowing with choice food, from fowls, fruit, to
                  confectionery, and he never tired of observing the merry, contented, black
                  faces.</p>
               <p>"This," said he, "is rather a singular specimen of Southern slavery and
                  oppression."</p>

               <p>ELLEN wished to have a private wedding, but Harry Sterling could not be induced to
                  consent. He insisted that friends and relatives, far and near, should be assembled
                  to witness the union of his two favorites, and the old homestead was a scene of
                  bustle for many days, in making preparations for the vast crowd.</p>
               <p>Never had Ellen's face wore a more touchingly lovely expression than upon the
                  evening of her bridal. A smile of happiness dwelt upon her lip, and a slightly
                  melancholy shade lingered in her wondrously beautiful eyes, giving an
                  indescribable dreamy sweetness to her countenance. Her hand rested confidingly
                  upon the arm that was to be henceforth her shield and guard, and in a calm, low
                  voice she pronounced the vows of love and fidelity that came fresh and true from
                  the gushing fountains of her pure, young heart. And amid all the joyousness that
                  surrounded her, Ellen's thoughts wandered to the loved ones no longer of earth.
                  Yet who can say that sainted Mary did not hold sweet communion with her child in
                  that happy hour, and bless the union of two souls in immortal love?</p>
