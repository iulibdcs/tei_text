This change, so new to them, and so i ~ortant in its bearings&#xD;
their 5l~arest interests, was regarded by t ~ olA inhabitants with&#xD;
~ to be placed, for the first time, under the 'iEeguard of a trial by&#xD;
solicitude.                  ''&#xD;
Mr. Jefferson, anxious to re~ider the newly est~b1ished tribunals ac~&#xD;
ceptable to the people, appointed to the office of J~u4~e of that District, a&#xD;
man whom, of all others capable of performing i~ duties, he deemed&#xD;
m9st calculated to gain their confidence, and to rer4~Ive their prejudices&#xD;
against the new administration of justice. Judge Li~as ~vas a native of&#xD;
France, and though true to his adopted country, whic1~ he had ably reps&#xD;
resented in Congress, still, in heart and soul he was a Frenchman,&#xD;
spoke their native language, attd felt, in common wlth a very large&#xD;
proportion of thti~ people of the territory, the strongest of all bonds of&#xD;
union-a similar nationcd origin.&#xD;
The second WEonday of May, 1805, now near at hand, was the day&#xD;
appointed for ~o~1ing the first session of this newly appointed court.-&#xD;
The Sheriff, Clerk, and other officers were appointed, a jury had been&#xD;
sun~mone4,"and the Judge hix~aself Id arrived in the vill~e. One of&#xD;
the l&amp;amp;~st"~nd most c6niiii~dl6~s houses in' the town had ~,een rented&#xD;
and fitted tt~, and e~ei~y ~hThg wa~ in readiness for opening t~te court on&#xD;
th~ morrow4.'&#xD;
Aside from the new mode of administering justice which was about&#xD;
to be commenced, there was another consideration that instead the&#xD;
day with a still deeper, and more thrilling interest. On th~ second&#xD;
Morid~y of May, CLA~YDINI~ LAvA~LE, a beautiful girl of s~teena&#xD;
native of St. Charles, the~ orphan daughter of, wealthy and respect~tble&#xD;
parents, was to 'he~tied for her life. She, Was 'charged with the ~ppaTh&#xD;
ing crime of murd~-of murdering her own br~ther.&#xD;
The, motive' thht induced her to couuhi~ thi~ revolting criine,,ws al-&#xD;
most v~niversally believed to be, that she might inherit, solely, the ~arge&#xD;
estate which, by the will of her 'deceased father, would have been e~al~&#xD;
~ ly divided between herself and her brother, when the latter arrived at ~he&#xD;
age of twenty~.one years, of which period there wanted, at the time of l~is&#xD;
S~ich a ~rime ha4' never before been perpetrated since the first set-&#xD;
tleinen~ of the territory, and the story cf that bloody tragedy had gone&#xD;
fortb% with, a thousand additions, each, more rev9lting than the former.&#xD;
There iva~ not a log cabin on the remotest frontier, whose inmates ba~&#xD;

name of f2laudine Lavalie, and children' instantly ceased from th&amp;amp;&#xD;
sports, and cast around 'them a lo~'~( of' fear.&#xD;
The voice of public opinion ~va~~lflio5t unanimously against her,'~and&#xD;
called loudly for the punishment ~ th~ infamod~ fratricid~ who had&#xD;
steeped her hands in the" blood of ~er only brother, while he, uncon~&#xD;
scious of danger from a sister, was '~~uried in sleep.&#xD;
Some of the ~ld~ inhabitants, who 1~ad seen that region pass from&#xD;
lhe dominion of Spain with no friend ~ eye, predicted, with many an&#xD;
ou~ino~s shake of th~ head, that the vile murderess would escape punish.&#xD;
inent, under th&amp;amp; new government.&#xD;
With the exception of her uncle ai~ l.aunt, and the venerablee priest&#xD;
of St. Charles, Father Laro~he, not otit'~, in her native village, believed&#xD;
her innocent. Even her uncle and aunt'~a~h many doubts, at times, ~nd&#xD;
their secret opinion was undecided, though~ they openly, ye~ in faint terms,&#xD;
denied that she was guilty. Not so was the priest. His conviction of&#xD;
her entire innocence wasjirm. Nothing cfrtild shake his confidence, for&#xD;
a moment, and he took, at once, an ene tgetic and decided stand in~&#xD;
her favors This magnanimous defense of' the unfortunate girl, brought&#xD;
down upon the priest, much obloquy. The ~xciteme~t ~gains~ Olaudine&#xD;
was such, that neither the sacred office of F .ither Laro5he; nor his long&#xD;
life devoted '~o pious labors for their bwn ~o6d, could shield him from&#xD;
reproach. Some carried their indignation ti'v far, that tLey refused ~o&#xD;
hear mass, or receive the sacraments of their ~hurch from a priest whom&#xD;
they r~arded as the frieiid and protector df a mui'deress. Pis at.''&#xD;

&#xD;
arts to gain the favorable 'opinion of Claudine, but her pure mind shrunk~&#xD;
intuitively, from all conversation with him that she could well airoid,&#xD;
and it was not without an effort that she constrained her feelings&#xD;
sufficiently to treat him with. the attention whirh the forms of soci-&#xD;
ety required.         /&#xD;
The evident aversion of Claudine was well calculated to excite the&#xD;
malice of such a man as Robertson, and he secretly resolved that he&#xD;
would not hesitate at the commission of any crime, to humble the&#xD;
haughty 'girl, and bring her to his feet. From that moment he redoub-&#xD;
led his attentions to Pierre, who in a few weeks was persuaded, in op-&#xD;
position to the 'advice of his uncle, and the entreaties of his sister, to&#xD;
accompany Robertson on a trading expedition among the Indians,&#xD;
and from thence to New Orleans.&#xD;
On their return, after an absence of nearly a year, the air and man-&#xD;
ner of these two associates toward each other, had undergone a decided&#xD;
change. Hitherto, and down to the time of their departure from St.&#xD;
Charles on that excursion, the bearing of Robertson toward Pierre, had&#xD;
been extremely respectful; in fact, he had uniformly paid. him the most&#xD;
flattering attentions. Now, Claudine saw with pain that her brother al-&#xD;
most trembled in his presence, while Robertson played the part of a&#xD;
man who can trample upon another with impunity, and glories in mak-&#xD;
ing that power manifest to others. She was not slow' iii discovering&#xD;
what Robertson evidently intended she should learn-th~aV1~liere was a&#xD;
secret between him and he;r brother, that placed the ~ complete-&#xD;
ly at his mercy. Nor was it long before she became aware of the&#xD;
purpose which the unprincipled villain intended to effect by means of&#xD;
the fatal ascendancy he had acquired over Pierre.&#xD;
Robertson one day, had the audacity to pay his "addresses" to Clau-&#xD;
dine, believing that the deep anxiety which she evidently felt for Pierre&#xD;
would influence her mind~ Her repulse was firm and decided, but re-&#xD;
spectful. But when at length his, proposal was renewed, and in a man-&#xD;
ner not to be misunderstood, she repelled him with all the indignant&#xD;
scorn, and the deep loathing which she' had so long restrained. Irri-&#xD;
tated almost to frenzy by the scornful rejection of a girl over whom he&#xD;
had supposed his power, through fears for her brother, was decided,~&#xD;
he threw off the mask of pretended affection for her, and boasted that&#xD;
by a few words he could bring Pierre to the gallows, and declared&#xD;
that the only means by which his silence could be secured, was to unite&#xD;
all their interests together.&#xD;
Claudine heard this dastardly threat, ~vith far deeper anguish than&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7686-00000005"/>&#xD;
CT4AUDLN1~ IAAYAtLE, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
she chose to betray, yet' calmly, firmly replied, that if Robertson actu-&#xD;
ally possessed the power over her brother that he boasted, neither du-&#xD;
ty to her brother, nor to herself, required her to sacrifice more than life&#xD;
itself to shield him from justice-that it would be far better for him, to&#xD;
betray his friend and associate to an ignominious death, thamn for her&#xD;
ever to marry an unprincipled villain, knowing him to be such-a fate&#xD;
ten-fold worse than death itself.&#xD;
The villain departed, abandoning all present hopes of success,&#xD;
though not relinquishing his purpose. Pierre now led a miserable life~&#xD;
Robertson kept him in constant fear of exposure and punishment. One&#xD;
day, he asked his sister to take a walk with him, to a favorite grove&#xD;
beyond the village, where all the rural festivals of the youth were cele-&#xD;
brated-the favorite resort of the young in their evening promenades.-&#xD;
For some time past, a coolness had existi~d on the part of Claudine toward&#xD;
her brother, caused by his continued intimacy with Robertson, and their&#xD;
accustomed walks had ceased.' Claudine declined accompanying him,&#xD;
but when he assured her that he' wished to acquaint her' with an im-&#xD;
portant secret, in which his fate was involved, she consented.&#xD;
With the fond hope that a sister's devoted ~love might, extricate him&#xD;
from the toils of his unprincipled associate, she, took his arm. As they&#xD;
approached the well known grove of walnut trees, her heart beat vi-&#xD;
olently. Sh4~lreaded, yet earnestly desired, to hear the revelation of&#xD;
her unfortunate' brother, which she greatly feared would disclose some&#xD;
dark crime, of which he had been guilty. They entered the grove, and&#xD;
Claudine looking anxiously around, to see that no one was near who&#xD;
could listen to their conversation, took a seat upon the mossy trunk of&#xD;
a fallen tree, and with a livid paleness of countenance and quivering&#xD;
lips, requested Pierre to make the disclosure he had proposed. Instead&#xD;
of complying with the request, he utter'cd a shrill whistle. Inst~tntly&#xD;
a rustling was heard in the bushes, and in a moment more, Robertson&#xD;
stood before them. Claudine was surprised, and highly indignant, but&#xD;
not alarmed. She felt that under the protection of a brother, unworthy&#xD;
as he was, she had nothing to fear.&#xD;
Robertson assumed an air of humble, respectful deference, and en-&#xD;
treated her pardon for having thus undesignedly intruded himself upor&#xD;
her and her brother. His professions of love, and his solicitation, of her&#xD;
hand in marriage were earnestly renewed. Pierre joined his entire~&#xD;
ties to those of Robertson. Influenced by the previous threats of his&#xD;
associate, to expose him to public execration ~ud the gallows, 'Pierreim.&#xD;

spired, to yield her consent. Claudine made no reply to these entrea,-&#xD;
ties but a look of withering 'scorn, and by tui~ning her back upon them,&#xD;
to return to the village. Robertson, .seeing her about to escape, sprang&#xD;
forward, and before she was aware of his intentions, seizing her rude..&#xD;
ly by the arm, sought to detain her. "Now, my scornful beauty," ex-&#xD;
claimed the ruffian, with a fearful oath, "now, my scornful beauty, you&#xD;
shall not escape me. If you do notvalue your brother's life, I will try&#xD;
other means that will make you even more willing to consent to a union&#xD;
with me, than I am myself. Swear that you will marry me, or by hea-&#xD;
vens you shall not leave thu place till-" The ,rest of the ruffian's&#xD;
threat expired upon his lips, unuttered, for a loud, crashing noise, in&#xD;
the bushes near at hand, startled him, and in his alarm at what he sup..&#xD;
posed, for a moment, was some one rushing to her assistance, he released&#xD;
her. The noise was occasioned by the hasty retreat of Pierre, whose&#xD;
fear of Robertson was so great that 'he cowardly abandoned her to her&#xD;
fate.&#xD;
When Claudine saw that her brother had basely fled and left her&#xD;
in the power of a villain, the imminence of her peril, instead of paraly-&#xD;
zing all her faculties, inspired her with almost superhuman energy and&#xD;
presence of mind. Recollecting that, by chance, she had about her a&#xD;
pair of sharp pointed scissors, which she had been using just before she&#xD;
and her brother set out upon their walk, she coolly, and with a firm hand,&#xD;
brandished them as a weapon of self-defense. Robertson was con-&#xD;
scious that he had proceeded too far to retreat with safety. His hand&#xD;
had'already grasped a pistol, resolved to secure his own safety, but in&#xD;
what manner is left only to conjecture, for at that moment of fearful&#xD;
peril to the unprotected girl, an Indian hunter who chanced to be sear'ch-&#xD;
ing for game in that vicinity, heard the wild screams of Claudino for&#xD;
help, bounded with the swiftness of a deer in the, direction of the sound?&#xD;
and arrived at that crisis of deadlyy peril to' Claudine.&#xD;
Robertson, muttering a fierce threat against her brother, if she disclo-&#xD;
sed his villainy, fled. Claudine, having seen the Indian at her uncle's,&#xD;
obtained his protection till she reached the village. Hardly had she&#xD;
seated herself in her own room, exhausted by the excising scenes through&#xD;
which she had passed, when Pierre entered, and, in the most moving&#xD;
terms, entreated her not to expose Robertson. His own life, he said, de-&#xD;
pended upon her silence. Robertson had sworn that he should die on&#xD;
The 'gallows, if his sister exposed him~&#xD;

pledge ol~ silerice that he requested. She hesitated less in giving this&#xD;
promise not to expose Robertson, because his departure would relieve&#xD;
her from all danger from that source, and besides, she reflected that she&#xD;
could not relate the scene in the grove, without consi~mng her own bro-&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
"What am I now? How ends my day of life?  ~&#xD;
For end it must; and terrible this gloom,&#xD;
This qtorm of horrors, that surrounds its close."-{Miee Bailile.&#xD;
For several wee)~s, Miss Lavulle neither saw nor heard of her per-&#xD;
secutor. He had left the village. Pierre, no longer under his influence,&#xD;
became regular inliishabits. The, hopes of his sister rose high, for what&#xD;
will riot a fon&amp;amp; sister hope fora brother~ 11e boarded at the house of&#xD;
her uncle, ate at the same table with her, and the rest of the family,&#xD;
but lodged in a small tenement, or out-house, a short distance from the&#xD;
house in which the family resided, but enclosed in the same yard.&#xD;
The dwelling house of Mr. Duclore, was one of those low, but&#xD;
commodious buildings, so common among the French of Lower Cana-&#xD;
da~ It stood some few feet from the ground, was of ~eat length, and&#xD;
divided in the center by a wide passage that separated one half of the&#xD;
house from the other. The room occupied by Claudinewas at one end&#xD;
of this long pile, remote from the sleeping room of her uncle and aunt.&#xD;
This, however, formed no objectioki, ~or the town was so quiet th~it few&#xD;
doors could boast either of a locir, oi~ bolt. To Claudine's door, botl&amp;amp;&#xD;
bad beeh affixed, at her request, since her interview with Robertson.&#xD;
About six weeks after ~he memorable scene in the grove, which we&#xD;
*       have just related, Claudine, who had passed the day in company with&#xD;
her aunt, at the house of a sick neighbor, returned home just at dark.&#xD;
It was a part of her daily duties to take care of her brother's room. She&#xD;
now recollected that she had fail~cI to make his bed. It was not yet dark,&#xD;
and she hastened to repair het neglect, before supper, which would&#xD;
*       soon beuponthe tabLe. Her uncle and brother had also been abserit dii-&#xD;
ring the day, and dined abroad, but both had now returned.&#xD;
In the direction in which Claudine approached the out-house in which&#xD;
&#xD;
THE P~EBT eo~vior.~&#xD;
her brother slept, no one could be seen from the in~side. When she&#xD;
r4ched' the corner of the building, her footsteps were sudde~rly arrest-&#xD;
ed, by0the sound of voices from within. She paused, and bent her ear&#xD;
to a crevice in the wall. To her utter astonishment, she heard the&#xD;
voice of Robertson. He was in earnest conversation with her brother~&#xD;
They spoke in a low, suppressed tone, b~it with all her faculties power-&#xD;
fully excited, every word, every syllable they uttered was distinctly heard,&#xD;
and fefl upon her heart like molten lead. She heard them concert a.&#xD;
plot, of which ske was the intended victim. At the dead hour of mid'~&#xD;
night, when all the family were buried in profound sleep, Robertson was&#xD;
to enter her apartment. If he failed of gaining an entranceby the means&#xD;
they had devised, Pierre was to knock at her door) call to her, gently,&#xD;
and under pretence of being seized with sudden illness, for which he&#xD;
wanted her aid, quietly introduce Robertson. Should any possible mis'&#xD;
chance defeat their plans, and Claudine succeed in alarming the fami'&#xD;
ly, Robertson was to flee instantly for Prairie Des Sioux, while Pierre&#xD;
remained at the door of his sister's apartment, ready to swear that no&#xD;
one but himself hadapproached. Thus, in any event, all suspicion of&#xD;
evil intentions, would be effectually prevented.&#xD;
Claudine waited to hear no more, but glided back, cautiously, and&#xD;
unperceived, to the house. Pale and agitated, she entered the apart..&#xD;
ment occupied by the family, threw herself into a chair, to collect her&#xD;
thoughts, and reflect, coolly, upon the course most advisable for her to&#xD;
pursue.&#xD;
Had she followed her first intention, the dictate of the moment, she&#xD;
uld have gone instatitly tQ her uncle, di~cIosed the plot against her,&#xD;
and demanded his protection. But a few minutes of cool considerationi,&#xD;
induced her to abandon this course, for it would be fatal to the reputa-&#xD;
tion of her brother, and deeply as Pierre had wrOnged her, she hadnot&#xD;
forgottenthat he was her brother. Guilty as he was, she tru~ted he&#xD;
would yet reform if he could be severed from all connection with&#xD;
Robertson.&#xD;
After long meditation, C~audi~e resolved not to disclose the dark plot,&#xD;
but adopt such measures as would efrectually defeat it. She ihou~ht olE&#xD;
asking permission to sleep that night in the apartment of hex~ a~4t~t,&#xD;
and on the morrow, obtain permission to occupy, thereafter, *i&#xD;
nearer .to her's. Hut, recollecting that there was but one b~4 iii her&#xD;
aunt's sleeping apartment, she abandoned that idea. Oii~ ~efI~ctioi~,&#xD;
atreal cause of fear was there, after all, to aeter her from remaining&#xD;
iii her own room? There was both a lock and a bolt to her door, either&#xD;

without alarming the whole family. -Th.e window wais~th~e caly remidu. -'&#xD;
ing entrance to her room, and this, too,' was secure against the possit ility&#xD;
of entrance from the outside. These reflections dispelled her~fears,&#xD;
and calmed the agitation of her mind.&#xD;
Supper was announced, and at that moment Pierre entered and took&#xD;
his seat at the table, with the rest of the family.' Instead of being op-.&#xD;
pressed with the consciousness of the crime he meditated, lhe appeared&#xD;
unusually light-.hearted, talked much, and in a tone of gaiety.&#xD;
Claudine dared not turn her eyes in the direction of her brother, lest&#xD;
her countenance should betray a knowledge of their dark designs. It&#xD;
was even with extreme difficulty that she could shallow a sufficiency of&#xD;
food to escape observation anpl remark, whic17 she was so anxious to&#xD;
avoid. She drank a cup of coffee, and by great exertion and presence&#xD;
of mind, appeared so much at ease that her extreme paleness, and want&#xD;
of appetite, escaped observation.&#xD;
Her uncle casually inquired of Pierre, when he had last seen Robert-&#xD;
son. ' Caudine felt her countenance become still paler,,as she listened,&#xD;
with downcast eyes and a throbbing heart, for the reply or her brother.&#xD;
ieg arnswered, promptly, and without the slightest hesitation or emibar-,&#xD;
r'assment, that he had not seen Rotertson since his departure for Prairie&#xD;
Des Sioux, six weeks ago. "He knew not," he said, "whether he still&#xD;
resided at that place, but believed that he had left the country altogethei-,&#xD;
and gone to reside in New-Orleans."&#xD;
Claudine could hardly repress the feeling of utter loathing which this&#xD;
new proof of, Pierre's villany and hypocrisy excited. It, required all the&#xD;
tenderness of a sister for an only brother, to restrain her fromt adopting&#xD;
means of 'protecting herself from their deep-laid schemes of villany, less&#xD;
forbearing toward that brother, than she had designed.&#xD;
Supper ended, and the famiilj withdrawn, from the talle, Pierre still&#xD;
detained his seat, all the time talking in a light and airy style of trifling,&#xD;
and busied himself in a tempting to balance his tea-spoon up on the edge&#xD;
of his cup. -At length, he rose sueldeniy, and under pretence of having&#xD;
just 'ecollected the subject, remarked with a careless air, that he. would&#xD;
take some of the fragments of 'the supper to feed his .dog, gathered, upon&#xD;
a plate, several articles of food, and departed..&#xD;
Claudine had no difficulty in understanding, by this artful manonuvre,&#xD;
that Robertson was still in the, apartment of her brother, and intended.'&#xD;
that no one in St. Charles' should know that .he was- in the village, or,&#xD;
have any reason to suspect that he had left Prairie Des Sioux.-&#xD;

' The hour when the family usually -retired to their beds,; ari'ived.-&#xD;
. Claudine, in conformity with the uniform practice of' French families,&#xD;
bade her aunt "Good Night," with an affectionate kiss, which was return-&#xD;
ed in 'the same k nd manner. Whern she bestowed upon her uncle,&#xD;
the same parting salutation, she whispered a few words in his ear that&#xD;
made him start back with astonishment, rnd exclaim, '9fonwDidufa/.'gt~z&#xD;
can the child want with an axe, at this time of night ?" 'Her aunt sawr&#xD;
by. the pale and agitated countenance of her'diece, that ishes.hadi~rmade&#xD;
the request for some purpose which she did not wish, .just at that rhe-&#xD;
nment, to disclose, and with the tact of a woman, camre 'instantly to her&#xD;
relief. Giving her husband no opportunity to distress the 'girV with&#xD;
further inquiries, she busied herself in procuring the article required,&#xD;
chattering all .the while with the volut ility of a sprightlyr French 'A oman,&#xD;
upon other and indifferent topics; Fortunately, the axe happened to be&#xD;
in the house. It -had been sent that day to a shop, to be ground, and the&#xD;
lad who brought it -home, in the absence of the family, left it irn the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
Claudine received the axe from the hands of her aunt, and without&#xD;
uttering a word, retired, taking it with her, into her own room. Then,&#xD;
first examining every corner of her apartment, and looking carefully&#xD;
under her bed, to see that no one lurked beneath it, she locked, and&#xD;
booked her door. After these precautions, as if to make assurance doubly&#xD;
sure, she drew her bureau against the door, and placed behind the tearit,&#xD;
every remaining article of furniture that she had in the room; The&#xD;
window, also, was carefully secured. She then paused, and surveyed&#xD;
her fortifications with a smile of triumph, perfectly satisfied that no one&#xD;
could senter the room, without using violent means that would alarm the&#xD;
whole neighborhood.&#xD;
Placing the axe, that deadly weapon of self-defense, near the head of&#xD;
her bed, without the slightest expectation that any serious tuipt to&#xD;
-enter the room would be made, and commending hiemseleirdntlyto&#xD;
the guardian care of, the "Virgin Mother of God," she reited toebt,&#xD;
with a feeling of perfect security. Fatigue~d by the labors of e'd#y,&#xD;
and, exhausted by the exciting emotions that she had endured, Cadtdine&#xD;
sunk at once, into a calm, and profound sleep.&#xD;
A noise of' an unusual' kind awoke her. The sun bad already risen.&#xD;
Springing from her bed, and peeping between the folds of her winddcr&#xD;
curtains, she saw,-with astonishment, several of the inhabitantf fthe&#xD;
village: hurrying- rapidly across the yard. The' view ifrom the witidow&#xD;
~was toordimited to pertnit her to discover where they were going. M'ith&#xD;

haMe she proceeded ~to pdt on her dress, but had not yet completed her&#xD;
toilet, when a load' noise was heard at her door, and severM v6icea at&#xD;
cuse, called her by name, and demanded admittaiTice. Before she had&#xD;
time to remove all the articles that blockaded the entrance of her zpart-&#xD;
merit, the door was unceremoniously opened, and several men, acoor4~&#xD;
paui~d by her unele, and a magistrate, entered. A crowd followed, and&#xD;
hung round the door, with openmouthed wonder and curiosity. Miss&#xD;
LavaUe~ ~a~ed with speechless astonishment upon this unexpected throng&#xD;
vf itiorflin~ visitors. Not so the magistrate, wlfb gave orders to his&#xD;
attendants t~ permit no one to enter the room, or leave it, till he had&#xD;
a legal examination of the premises.&#xD;
Looking around the room, with a searching eye, the handle of the axe,&#xD;
under the bed, caught his view. He drew it forth. Great God! what&#xD;
'ci sight! It was the very same axe that the girl had placed at her&#xD;
bed-side, 6n retiring to sleep, but the handle of it, 'from one end to the&#xD;
dtlier, was clotted thickly with blood. Upon the blade was distinctly&#xD;
seen a t ut~t of human hair, of a dark auburn color. The gore, in con&#xD;
gealing, had caused it to adhere to the' smooth steel.&#xD;
The magistrate asked the stupefied girl, "how that 'instrument came&#xD;
there, and in that condition?" Before she had time to utter a word in&#xD;
reply, the voice of Mr. Mordaunt, a talented young lawyer, wJ~o had&#xD;
receht'ly settled i~ St. Charles, rose loud and' clear above the tumult,&#xD;
Commanding her, on the peril of her life, to answer no questions, and&#xD;
iitt~r not a word, till he should have an 'opportunity ol conv~r~ing with her,&#xD;
a moment, in private. Then, turning to the magistrate, he added, "I&#xD;
constitutO myself the counsel of that young lady, till 'she 'has time to clroo$e&#xD;
One, to protect her rights; and I will take the liberty of inforrnin~ you1~&#xD;
worship, most respectfully, that neither law, nor yet justice, gives you the&#xD;
4ght to ask her a single question, the an~Wer of which might cnirninate&#xD;
herself." *Th~mt officer replied that he had no such intenti~h, but, ~mi~che&#xD;
contrary, made ~he inquiry about the axe, under a full impression that she&#xD;
might explain, in a satisfactory manner, every citcumstance that appa.&#xD;
rently seemed to militate against hers&#xD;
All this while Mis's Lavalle stood motionless, silent, rind hor~sttuck,&#xD;
anxious to gain a clue to this mysterious affair, yet unable to utter u 'word&#xD;
of; inquiry. Her uncle at length came forWard, and dmbrricing her&#xD;

bed was found a shoe, a~d a 'shawl, both of which the uncle and aunt&#xD;
had inadvertently admitted that Claudine Wore, when she retired to her&#xD;
'apartment, on the night previous.&#xD;
It is needless to give; in detail, an account of her examination 'before&#xD;

'at the approaching session 'of the U. S. District Court. it was hardly&#xD;

period usually assigned to his visits.. Thethfrd hour after midnight, when&#xD;
the first scene of the story opens, Lound him yet in her dungeon. Under&#xD;
the seal o~ the sacrament of confession, she had related' to him again, cir-&#xD;
cuznstantial4, her first interview with Robertson, his subsequent course,&#xD;
his influence over Pierre, and the plot sha had overheard at the out-house&#xD;
occupied by her brother.&#xD;
N otwithstanding the impossibility of accounting for many ~ircuin5tanCe8&#xD;
that bore with crushing weight against her, Father L~roche had not the&#xD;
remotest doubt of her entire innocence. His suspicions rested strongly&#xD;
against Robertson, but ai ter the ifiost diligent, searching inquiry, nothing&#xD;
had been elicited to connect him with that tragedy. On the morning of&#xD;
the murder he ~vas seen at Prairie Des Sioux, and no proof existed that&#xD;
he h~d left that place.&#xD;
The venerable priest did not conceal from his ward, that her conviction&#xD;
at the apprdaching trial, was nearly certain. No judge or jury. he assur.&#xD;
edl~er, would resist the strong array of circumstantial evidence of her guilt,&#xD;
especially when her acquittal would inevitably bring !own upon their own&#xD;
heads, a stprm of popular indignation He gave her, in detail, such in.&#xD;
formation ~nd advice as he thought would be useful to her, on her trial&#xD;
upon the morrow.&#xD;
It vA east midnight, when all that related to her defense,~and to her&#xD;
other temporal concerns, had been hilly discussed. Nothing now re-&#xD;
inain~ ~or him to do, at this last solemn interview with the prisoner&#xD;
~eceding~er trial, but to fortify her mind to bear with calm r~ignation&#xD;
*the doom that might await. Deeply did he feel the peril of the afflicted&#xD;
girl. He had known her from the earliest days of her infadcy and&#xD;
since the death of her parents, had been, her guardiar~, 'and felt for her&#xD;
the affection of a father. He now administered to her 'the conse~t~ted&#xD;
wafer, and prayed, most fervently prayed for her, the lonely captive.&#xD;
It is 4oply when affliction s press heavily upon us, and every hope of&#xD;
humar~ aid is torn from the bruised heart, that we invoke tjie aid of&#xD;
Heaven with all the deep fervor~f~ q~r souls. The prices felt that no&#xD;
arm could shield the unhappy girl, but that of Omnipotence, and he&#xD;
poured ~forth his supplications with an earnestness that shook his whole&#xD;
'frama, In the deep fervor of )iis prayer, thi venerable old man bowed&#xD;
his head till his white locks touched the cold stone floor. As if conscious&#xD;
'that the intercession of the saints~ or even of the Blessed Virgin herself,&#xD;
could avail not in that dark and fearful hour, he addressed no prayer, no&#xD;
supplication to them, but appealed directl!J to Him who was ~rucifled.'-.&#xD;

The scene was one of deep and stAemn interest. There sa~t the youth.&#xD;
ThI prisoner, upon a, bundle of straw, pn~the stone floor, in the~n~dle of&#xD;
the prison. The feeble light of the ~xpii~ii~' la~mp4one dlm4d fit-&#xD;
fully, in the damp, unwholesome air of the~dungeon~~ Th~e ;she sat&#xD;
her manacled hands 'clasped ,in prayer, her head Len~ reyerei~tly toward&#xD;
th~ earth. As she moved, slightly, the clanking of her Qhainb sent forth&#xD;
a lo~v sound that vibrated upon the heart o~ the old priest. Mis whole&#xD;
soul was pc~ured out in that prayer.&#xD;
His supplications fail~ of in~piring either himself or his ward, with&#xD;
even a shadow of hope of her acquittal, yet in its stead, a calm a~nd Loly&#xD;
resignation, like a healing 'balm, diffused itself through her soul. She&#xD;
felt a cllild4ike confidence' in the wis&amp;amp;om and goodness of her Heav~tnly&#xD;
father, and whether life or death might be her doom, she doubted not&#xD;
that it would be meted out to her in love.&#xD;
The priest rose from his knees, and recommending Claudine to snatch&#xD;
a few hours of sleep, bade her a most bender adieu, and departed~ to~ee~k&#xD;
for himself a brief repose, before the labors of the eventful day should&#xD;
commence, which would require all his energies. ,&#xD;
Claudine sat, for many minutes after his departure, buried in deep and&#xD;
painful thoughts. Just as she, was preparing to lie down to sleep, upon&#xD;
her bed of straw, her attention was aroused by a faint sou9d in a distant&#xD;
part of her dungeon.. To her' astonishment, a narrow 4oor, which she'&#xD;
had never before noticed, slo*ly'an,4,cauriously opened. A human figure,&#xD;
the outline alone of'.ivhich was vi~i~ie, in tjbe dim ol~scurity, entered, and&#xD;
by signs, earnestly entreated silence. , T~iis ur~expected apparition ap-&#xD;

and -s~cthi~g tones of compasal'on. He expressed- the -utmost-regret for&#xD;
her ~ ~or/ditica~ 'H~ had conversed with many gentlemen of&#xD;

be condemned. He had a horse ready for her to mount, -a- few r-od!s&#xD;
from the pi'ison~ He wouki conduct her to his residence in Prairie Des&#xD;
Sioux, Where she could rei~iain concealed, till the next night, -when-he&#xD;
would embark with her in a skiff which he had already -provided, and&#xD;
descend the Mississippi to New Orleans, or to some other place, where,&#xD;
under an -assumed name, they could reside in safety. The moment it&#xD;
could -be done without danger of detection, hewo~ld. marry her, lawfully.&#xD;
2~ow was her only chance of escape, he said. After her trial and con~&#xD;
demnation, and -eortdemned ~she most assuredly would -be, the -prison&#xD;
would be too carefully guard~d-to afford him another opportunity of -en-&#xD;
tering it, without detection.&#xD;
Encouraged by her silence ~f believe that she assented to all he had&#xD;
uttered, he proceeded. No effort of - which he was capable should be&#xD;
spared to render her life happy. He professed unbounded-affection,&#xD;
and deeply ~depIbred his base conduct in the grove. Despair of -obtain-&#xD;
ing her hand in marriage, he said, had driven -him into a momentary&#xD;
frenzy, for which he humbly besought her pardon. "Come," said he,&#xD;
"we have not a moment to lose in making our escape. -it will -be Che&#xD;
work of but a few minutes for me t~ ~reliev~ you of your chains, and con-&#xD;

the manner -of- your escape, and - no plsrsuit- will be made."&#xD;
Saying this. he advanced, and bending down to where-she-sat-on -the&#xD;
floor, took hold of her arm-to raise her to her feet. His touch pro-&#xD;
duced- the effect of an electric shock, and she recoiled as -if a serpent&#xD;
had sung her.&#xD;
"Begone!" skid she, in a tone that -expressed all - the deep -loathing&#xD;
of her-soul -for -his dark treachery and -villany, "Begone! - and leave -~e&#xD;
- to my fate! No doom that may await me, can -be so revolting -to ~e, as&#xD;

w ~oie fra~c, an~ she involuntarily paused. Quickly recovering from&#xD;
the emotions which that horrible image had excited, she continued:&#xD;
"Death, under aii.y form, is far preferable to a union with you, even&#xD;
could that union be sanctioned by the holy rites of the church. - You&#xD;
have inflicted upon me the grosse~ injustice, and attempted to commit&#xD;
a Wrong which no ti~ue woman can forgive, even on her death bed.-&#xD;
Ilut even this is not-all. I charge you, James Robertson, with the mur--&#xD;
der of my brother.-~-in the presence of God, the searcher of all hearts, -&#xD;
I charge you with that murder for which I am c~omed to die!"&#xD;
In uttering these words, Claudine rose to her feet, and stood erect,&#xD;
before him. Her eye flashed, and her look -was one of stern defiance,&#xD;
and firm resolve. Robertson turned pale. With all his boldness of vil-&#xD;
lany, he quailed at the- unexpected charge of murder, a~d the fearless&#xD;
manner in which it was made, by a timid girl who, he had not doubted,&#xD;
would eagerly seize upon any chance, to escape from prison. But&#xD;
(1UiCkJy recovering his natural audacity, he replied: "You chai'ge me&#xD;
with a crime of which I am incapable. - Your brother was my dearest&#xD;
friend, and I can easily prove that on the night of the murder, I was at&#xD;
Prairie Des Sioux, and that for more than a month previous t~ that&#xD;
melancholy event, I had not once le~ft that place~"&#xD;
Claudine made no other reply to this, but a brief relation, in a few&#xD;
expressive words, of the plot she had overheard between him and her&#xD;
brother, on the night of the murder.&#xD;
At this disclosure the countenance of Robertson became livid. -~ ~Not&#xD;
daring to remain longer iii the pi~ison, he made a last effort io operate&#xD;
upon her fears, and induce her to accompany him. Finding all his&#xD;
arguments and entreaties hopeless, -he left the prison, his heart torn '~'ith&#xD;
the fierce passions of rage, disapp&amp;amp;iiited hopes, malice and revenge.&#xD;
Claudino made no attempt to rd~m the jailor, or prevent his escape,&#xD;
for she knew that the first cry sheuttered would be followed by instan-~&#xD;
taneoi~s death to herself, without proving the means of his detection.&#xD;
lie had the power in his hands of gaining the outside of the prison,&#xD;
and of subsequent escape, an(l yet leave behind him not a single en-&#xD;
dence that he had entered.&#xD;

From the earliest .hours~ of the morning,, people could be seen at a.&#xD;
great distance, some on foot, some on 'horse-back, and others in-wagons,&#xD;
all wending their. way to the village: Far as the eye coitid extend its.&#xD;
vision,~ tl~e broad prairie that sweeps off frotm. the village till it meets the&#xD;
horizon, was; here and. there dotted with moving points. Now it was&#xD;
a horseman,, there a pedestrian, a wagon,~ca.rt, or some other kjnd o$ ye-&#xD;
hide employed on the- frontier~. The land-mark by which they direc-&#xD;
ted their course over this "sea of verdure," was-ar tall, mound that stood&#xD;
alone in this ~ilent 'waste The storms of ages had worn and. rounded&#xD;
us summit into two graceful cones~ to whiclv the early French settler~&#xD;
gave the appropriate name 'of "Les .4farnel1es.~' Entire families, from&#xD;
the aged grandsire down to the infant upon its mother's bosom, had ar-&#xD;
rived.from.~a distance of several days' journey. Great numbers had en-&#xD;
camped in' the neighborhood of. the village, and the smoke of camp-&#xD;
fires rose from alL the surrounding. gxoves..&#xD;
It was not alone., the interest these crowds. felt in hearing the trial&#xD;
of Claudine that4~ad drawathem hither. Under the Spanish govern-&#xD;
inei~ they had been accustomed to' see the convict brought~ forth for pun--&#xD;
ishul nt before the last. et~ho of his sentence had expired. They were'&#xD;
not aware that i~nder~ the humane laws of the Upited States an interval.&#xD;
of several weeks intervenes between the sentence of. death and its ex-&#xD;
ecution, and hence it was that not a small part of this immense&#xD;
throng of human beings came therewith the expectation-of seeing C1au-&#xD;
dine Lavalle executed.&#xD;
The hour of ten~ o'clock in the morning; arrived and' the d~rs o~ the&#xD;
building appropriated on this occa~j~4~to' the use of the court, were&#xD;
thro~vn open. Judge Lucas took hi~seat, and aie Shcriff, by his order,.&#xD;
declared in due form that' the court '~vas now open for the transaction ci:&#xD;
business.. The jury ~was called and sworn in, when the judge delivered&#xD;
to theni- an impressive charge both in French and in English.. The&#xD;
U. S. Attorney for the Thstrict then moved that the court do now pro-&#xD;
ceed with the trial of the flr~t case on the d6cket, that of Claudine La..&#xD;
valle,~charged with the crime of murder. This motion was granted, and&#xD;
the sheriff ordered to-bri~ng forth the pi'isoner.&#xD;
In a moment every- spectator hurried £ron~ the court, ~nxiou~ to-catch-&#xD;
~ g~im~ipse of the fiend in human shape who had murdered' her own ai~d1&#xD;
only brother. The intelligence that she was about to be conducted int~o'&#xD;
court, spread like wild-fire among the engur. throngs that crowded' the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
-streets of the ~iillage. The sheriff had taken the precaution of stim-&#xD;
moning to his aid a band .ef militia armed with muskets, and fixed bay..&#xD;
'onets, to keep off ~the crowd. It was not without -difficulty that even&#xD;
these, .arme'das they were, could induce the..eagerm~ilt.itude to lee.ve an&#xD;
open space for the ~ssage of the sheriff and .his prisoner.&#xD;
At length the massive key was heard turning the hoIt~ of the lock, anti&#xD;
ithe iron~barred door slowly swung open. -Claudine Lavalle -came forth,&#xD;
walking between the priest and the sheriW ,holding an. arm of each.&#xD;
'She was dressed in deep mourning. On that day she. had 'paid more&#xD;
than? ususi attention to her toilet. Her attire was plain., but neat and&#xD;
highly appropriate. Its extreme-simplicity gave, it a gr~ce which no or-&#xD;
-nament eould have afforded.&#xD;
Months had gone 'by since 'the fatal day 'en which she was committed&#xD;
to prison, and it was now, for the, first time d~iring that long period,, that&#xD;
~she was permitted to breathe 'the pure air, and gaze upon the face-of&#xD;
'the heavens. To leave once more the gloomy. vault of her;dungeou,'and&#xD;
look abroad, even fona short space of time, up ontthe happy living world,&#xD;
and gaze upon the bright landscape with.which her eye had been Lamib&#xD;
iiar from infancy-this was enjoyment, exquisite though rnelanchply..&#xD;
For a time, Iher thoughts seemed wholly occupied~in the contemplation&#xD;
'of the scenery around her, .and her heart appe~mred.alive. 'only to the&#xD;
-emotions which that view excite&amp;amp;. Gratitude to that .Almighty Pew~r&#xD;

&#xD;
modest and self-possessed. Father Laroche, whose devoted att~ention&#xD;
to his ward no unpopularity and no reproach could move, was per-&#xD;
mitted to sit by her side.&#xD;
The bill of indictment was read, and the case opened by the pros-&#xD;
ecuting attorr&amp;amp;ey who remarked that duty compelled hint to lay the guilt&#xD;
of the prisoner fully before the jury, yet in the management of the&#xD;
case he should take no undue means to procure her conviction. His&#xD;
aim, he said, was justice, and to no' one would proof of the inno-&#xD;
cence of the accused afford more g~atiflcation than to himself.&#xD;
The witnesses for the prosecution were sworn and examined. It&#xD;
was proved that Miss Lavalle, about six weeks before her brother's&#xD;
death, was seen to take a walk with the deceased to the walnut grove&#xD;
beyon&amp;amp; the village, from which she shortly after returned alone, and&#xD;
evidently much excited. Her aunt remarking this, inquired of Clau-&#xD;
dine if she and her brother had quarreled; to which Claudine made no&#xD;
reply, except that it was the last time sh~ would walk with him.---&#xD;
From' that day a coldness on the part of Claudine towards her brother&#xD;
had been visible, and though the aunt named the subject to her, she&#xD;
made no reply, and gave no explanation ~f the zause.&#xD;
it was proved,' likewise, that she had taken into her sleeping apart-&#xD;
ment,' the very axe that was found there, in the morning, covered with&#xD;
blood. A surgeon sivore that the wounds of which the deceased had&#xD;
died, were, beyond a doubt, inflicted with an axe, and that the* tuft of&#xD;
hair adhering to the blade, exac~iy resembled that of the deceased.&#xD;
It was likewise proved that Cluudine locked and bolted: her door&#xD;
that night, and that no one could have gained entrance against her&#xD;
~vill, without using violence that would have awakened the neighbor-&#xD;
.hood. zTdtat~no.ne .~but herself had entered, was evident' from the ap-&#xD;
pearance'o1~i~~efl 'the magistrate knocked there the next&#xD;
morning ~and~demiti~d~ ce. The shoe and the;shawl found by&#xD;
the bed-side ~of.th~eeea~ed', were proved to belong to Claudine. Her&#xD;
aunt testifkd that 'she~wore both when she retired to her sleeping apart-&#xD;
ment on that~6tabnight. On cross-examination, the' aunt te~tifled that&#xD;
ted on the evening preceding the murder,&#xD;
and at supper as deadly ptth~, and appeared to avoid looking at her&#xD;
brother; white Pierre,' on the contrary, seemed ttnusually light-hearted,&#xD;
talking and laughing incessantly. She also testified to her extreme agi-&#xD;
tation when she asked her uncle for the axe, and the aunt acknowledged,&#xD;
on being questioned, that she knew of. no use that instrument could be&#xD;
to Claudino, nor had she any idea of the purpose to whioh she intended&#xD;
to apply it.&#xD;
&#xD;
20&#xD;
&#xD;
The last will and testament of Jacques Francois Lavalle was int~'o.&#xD;
duced, and, after much argument, permitted~ by the court to be read, to&#xD;
show, as the prosecuting attorney afledged, the motives which the respond.&#xD;
dent' had for commitving.the dee4. , That instrument devised, property&#xD;
to the estimated. amount of. seventeen thousand six htuidi~ed 'and ninety&#xD;
dollars, besides' a Spanish grant of n large and valuable tract of land,&#xD;
which last claim was in dispute. This property was to be equally divi-&#xD;
ded between 'his two children, Pierre and Claudine, when the former ar.'&#xD;
rived at the age of twenty-one years. In the event of the death of cith-&#xD;
*er before arriving at lawful age, the sutvivor should inhprjt the 'whole&#xD;
eState.&#xD;
On the~ part of the defense, no testimony was sought to be, adduced,&#xD;
except in relation to the character~ of the accused.&#xD;
Her uncle testitl&amp;amp; that her conduct. had always been 'kind, amiable&#xD;
rtnd affectionate-that he could not call to mitrd a single fault she had&#xD;
*eomn2ittocl, from the days of her childhood to the time of her arrest. She&#xD;
had been to Pierre a fond, devoted sister, ever ready to sacrifice her&#xD;
own interest to his. It was about six weeis before the murder that he&#xD;
observed a change in her conduct toward her brother, a shrinking from&#xD;
his presence anda manifest desire to avoid him, but this appeared to&#xD;
have passed away, and her usual affe~tionate attentions were renewed.&#xD;
Father Ambrose Laroche was now called to the stand. His testimony&#xD;
in substance was briefly this: I am the parish priest of St4 Charles; have&#xD;
held that office for the last twenty years; 'had known the prisoner at the&#xD;
bar from her' birth; was the intimate friend of her parents, and on the&#xD;
death.bed of her 'father, the latter appointed rue sole guardian ~f This&#xD;
daughter,' Claudine; then a child hardly three years of age4 'lie had&#xD;
seen her almost daily ever since, and had been her only 'instructor.......&#xD;
~41ie had ever manifested for him the tender affection of a daughter. In&#xD;
all the sorrows and trials of her childhood, she had.nev~er failed of com.&#xD;
ing to him for consolation and advice, nor had her. conduct in. this re~&#xD;
~pect changed in later years. As her guardian, her friend, and still&#xD;
'more as her' copfessor, he said that he kne~v her~ heart, he believed,&#xD;
as thoroughly as it wa~ possible for ~oeTh.unr~n being to knew 'the&#xD;
heart' of. .~auether, .xand4eelaixed that he had lever known. any one so&#xD;
.trl~izunishle as 'she. With'a deep sense of the iresponsibilitythat iest.&#xD;
ed upon him ~ts a minister' at the altar of God, to divest himse.lf~ ~if all&#xD;
undue prepossessions in her favor, yet would he declare that. ~uich, was&#xD;
his 'knowledg~of the sterling forthh ~and truthfulness of ~her ~ha~c&#xD;
ter, that h~' would believe 'her on her bare 'assertion, in 'e~ositj~ ~,&#xD;

all the testimony' ~ that could he ~arrayed 'against' her. lie wotild have&#xD;
said more, but was interrupted by the prosecuting attorney, who pro-&#xD;
ites~ed against his giving mereopirmion instead of facts.&#xD;
'~The priest ~at down, resuming his seat by the side 'of, his yoting&#xD;
ward. Claudine had listened with breathless attention to the testimony&#xD;
of her guardian.; So' deep was the interest she felt, so eager was she&#xD;
'to catch every' word the venerable Lather uttered, that she leaned for-&#xD;
'ward'in her 'seat, .unmindPA of all, else that. was passing around her.&#xD;
When at length he took his seut by her side, she seized his hand, end,&#xD;
raising it to her 'lips, kissed it again and again with the fondest affec-&#xD;
tion. The warm approbation of her character which the venerable mata&#xD;
had expressed was a sweet drop in the bitter cup which she had nearly&#xD;
drained.&#xD;
The testimony on each side was aow closed, and th~ prosecutiiig at-&#xD;
torney. in the opinion 'of all, had convinced ~he jury ~thgr 'guilt. In&#xD;
all that' crowded assemblage of human beings, there was n~t one, prob-&#xD;
ably, except the priest, who believed her itmnocent. Mr. Mordaunt, the&#xD;
sole counsel of the accused,' arose, under these discouraging circumstan-&#xD;
ces, tie reply. lie has long since gone down into the grave. He died&#xD;
'in' the spring time of his life,' before he had yet gathered the laurels&#xD;
that would hare rendered his fame enduring. There aro yetin Mis-&#xD;
~ouri here and.there a venerable few yet hingeriog, who listened with&#xD;
thrilling interest to his masterly defense of Claudine Lavalle. These&#xD;
venerable patriarchs cannot yet hear that'plea named without betraying&#xD;
deep emotions. The ,writer 'has before ~him a copy of the ~brief 'notes&#xD;
taken down from the lips of Mr. Mordaun~ during its delivery,' by a&#xD;
gentleman longsince deceased.: These notes, though a mere sketch' of&#xD;
the outlines, afford sufficient proof that his effort on that' oec~asion,&#xD;
though hopeless one, was indeed masterly. Against the strong array&#xD;
of evidence in that'case,'success could not have been expected.&#xD;
He d~velt long upon the deceptive nature of circumstantial evidence,&#xD;
and contended that no imumber of probabi1iti~,' however numerous~ or&#xD;
'striking, could make one 'c~rtaint!,., Where the testimony was not po~i-&#xD;
tive, a:jury could iinot saf4~r say on their qaths that the accused is guilty.&#xD;
A man might be found~'r6bbed'and murdered in a lonely place1 and an~&#xD;
oth@ 'might 'be seizeti' near the spot with the bloody knife irr his~hand,&#xD;
and the watch and puree of'the victim~ iii his pocket, and yet be inno-&#xD;

"GUILTY." Every eye was instantly turned upon the convict, to mark&#xD;
the' effect of 'that appalling won!. But the certainty of her doom was&#xD;
far more easily borne than the agony of suspense that preceded it. A&#xD;
smile of heavenly resignation beamed upon her features as she pressed&#xD;
the hand of the good old priest silently in hers. The venerable father&#xD;
uttered no exclamation of grief, and shed no tears. He reverently&#xD;
bowed his gray head, and in a low but fervent tone breathed the shea&#xD;
but expressive prayer, "On GOD! THY IIOL~ WILL&#xD;
Judge Lucas now put on the black .cap and addressed the prisoner~&#xD;
"Claudine Lavalle: After a Lair and impartial investigation of the law&#xD;
and the evidence of your case1 a jury of your country on their oath.&#xD;
have' declared you guilty of the murder of Pierre Lavalle, your own&#xD;
brother. It only remains for the court to perform the painful duty of&#xD;
pronouncing sentence of death upon you. Have you any thing to say&#xD;
why such sentence should mnot be pronounced?"&#xD;
Here the judge made a solemn pause to await her answers Clau.~&#xD;
dine was aware that the inquiry was a mere form, and that no reply of&#xD;
hers could affect her doom. Yet to her, the answer that she Would give&#xD;
seemed a relinquishment of her last claim, upon life, a severance of the&#xD;
only remaining tie that connected her with the living world, and slowly&#xD;
and deliberately she pronounced the single word "NOTHING:' but in a&#xD;
tone, an~ ~yith. a look that thrilled to every heart.&#xD;
The judge proceeded: "It is my order, then. that you be remanded to&#xD;
the prison from whence you were taken, and there kept in close con-&#xD;
fin~rnent till the sixteenth day of June next, on which day, between the&#xD;
hours of one and five o'clock in the afternoon, you be taken thence by&#xD;
the sheriff to the place of execution, and there hung by the neck till you&#xD;
be dead; and may God have mercy on your soul."&#xD;
It was near sunset when Claudine Lavalle, now under sentence o~&#xD;
death, slowly wended her way back to her still&#xD;
dungeon,    accompcttfl((&#xD;
by her faithful gu~rdiau and the' sheriff. Her trial had been brief, fec&#xD;

&#xD;
Ralinond D'Iberville, a wealthy planter of the Coast. A lady of thirty.&#xD;
five years~, whose form and features are stiUbeautiful,~ sits alone, reclin-&#xD;
eng in a pensive attitude upon a rich ottoman. The cpstly furniture and&#xD;
the elegance of the apartment afford her no pleasure. Her, thoughts&#xD;
are far away and busied with the, long past. Sadness like a darl~ cloud&#xD;
steals over her expressive countenance, and grows deeper and deeper as&#xD;
thought after thought comes thronging onward, and calls up the scenes&#xD;
of other' times. A gentleman of tall, manly figure, but apparently ten&#xD;
years older than herself, enters." His presence ha~s not awakened" the&#xD;
pensive lady from her melancholy reverie. She is unconscious that an&#xD;
one has entered the room.' The gentleman "'gazes upon 'her mourn~LlI&#xD;
brow for several minutes, with a look of the fondest affection inin~led&#xD;
with pity. 'At length he addressed her in French: "Ah! ma chere Ma-&#xD;
rie! dreaming over the past? How I hate the annual return of this day!&#xD;
You are always' thoughtful and sa4 for w~eks afterward. I wi~h th~&#xD;

I sho~4db~" Ve heard of you, and then Marie wo~Id noi1i~ve been&#xD;
my littLe ~'~' '~No! no! I will not be quite so 'hard on that~ day."&#xD;
While sa~i this lie had taken a seat upon the ottoman, 'and inge~i~&#xD;
ously con4ved to place her upon his knee. The lady, awakened' f~om'&#xD;
her reverie; could not avoid smiling at her husband, and said, "do you&#xD;
know, Raimond, what' Madam DLlval' said of you the other day? She&#xD;
said she could not have believed we were married, ~had she xipt actually&#xD;
seen th~ ceremony 'performed, for you aet, she says, ~ lover to&#xD;
me, and not at all like a husband." "Well," replj~d ;C~h~TJ'I~yrville~&#xD;
"the ~ld gossip, with all her spite, is not-far' from 'the truth thi~ once in&#xD;
her life, at least,, for I am indeed a lover, and my affection for you.~ now&#xD;
is even more devoted than it was when I told my mother, that I would&#xD;
not live unless she consented to my marriug&amp;amp;,with jyou.".&#xD;
Inadvertently he had touched a chord' ~ all her sorrows&#xD;
afresh. "Yes," she replied, "why should net,~the widowed. mother of&#xD;
an only son, the heir of wealth and an hQnornble. ~azne, recoil a~tlie&#xD;

It need not be told that Madam D'Iberville, the wealthy and polished&#xD;
lady whose ;society W~s cotirted by the highest ranks in New Orleans,&#xD;
~vas no other than the Glaudine Lavalle whom we saw twenty years&#xD;
ago that very day conducted from the court in St. Charles under sen-&#xD;
tence of death. When the venerable priest had obtained her pardon,&#xD;
~n. the very x~ight of his return he placed her in the care of a lady who&#xD;
was ge&amp;amp;ng with her husband to New Orleans. to embark for France.&#xD;
1-fe consigned his unfortunate ward to the care of his sister in that city,&#xD;
who was the Superior of the well~known order of nuns, th&amp;amp; Sisters of&#xD;
Charity. Cl&amp;amp;udin~ was received by the Superior with every mark of&#xD;
confidence and 1alfection, and immediately became a novice, with tke&#xD;
~nt~ntioh of taking the v~wa of the ~der~hn the three years of her&#xD;
~vitiate should have expired. All novices, wh~n they~ er a convent,&#xD;
receive~ a new na~ne~ She took that of Sister Marie isericordo.&#xD;
This name was often fondly used by her husband.&#xD;
Not lone after her admission, Madam D'Iberville, a widd~ of distin-&#xD;
guished excellence, re~pzested the Superior to permit the young novice,&#xD;
~arie, 'to reside for .a time in her family, and watch over .her declining&#xD;
health. The gentle girl ~oen w~n the confidence 'of Madam D'Iber-&#xD;
i-ills, and made a still deeper impression upon the heart of her son.&#xD;
The. widow iwt o!ily gave her consent to the union of her aen w~tb&#xD;
Claudine, but implored the girl; who. had decidedly refused, to give him&#xD;

ing upon her ilaughter.in-l~w, whose wo~th she had more fully seen,&#xD;
and thanked Heaven for giving to her son so inestimable a wife.&#xD;
In the afternoon of the day on which the scene we have described&#xD;
opened, the 'twentieth anniversary of the trial of Claudine Lavalle,&#xD;
Madam D'Ibervllle Loft an irresistible impulse to visit the Hospital of&#xD;
the Sisters~of Charity, among whom she had found an asylum when' she&#xD;
arrivedd 'in that cit~r a friendless 'out-cast. Her~husband kindly- attempt.&#xD;

THE YIRST CONTVIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
by the v~erable Superior, her early friend, who yet survived. They&#xD;
conducted their two visitors through the various apartments of the es-&#xD;
tablishment and the wards of the sick. As they approached the bed-&#xD;
side of a man who had but just been brought to the hospital in a dan-&#xD;
gerous condition, the agonizing groans of the patient excited their corn.&#xD;
passion.. They came to his side, and Madam D'Iberville, in a tone of&#xD;
soothing compassion, asked him if she could do anything to relieve his&#xD;
sufferings. At the sound of 'ier voice, the dying man 'started wildly&#xD;
and exdaimed, "Oh God! is that C'laudine Lavalle?" Gazing intent-&#xD;
ly upon her for a moment, he cried, "yes; it is her. Thank God that&#xD;
her murder, too, is not on' my soul at this fearful hour. Send instantly&#xD;
for a magistrate to take down my confession. Make haste, for the&#xD;
sands of my life are fast ebbing away. I am James, Robertson, the&#xD;
murderer of your brother,, for tvhi~h ctirne you were condemned to die,&#xD;
and my confession is necessary for your vindication. Be quick, for my&#xD;
minutes are numbered."&#xD;
Col. D'Iberville lost no time ~ procuring the attendance 9f a magis.&#xD;
trate, who took down, in legal form, the dying confession of Robertson.,&#xD;
The substance of his disclosure, omitting circumstances ,already known&#xD;
to the render, is the following:&#xD;
Robertson, burning with malice and~ ~eveng9 at the repulse he had&#xD;
received from the pure-minded Claudine, resolved to humble the haugh~.-&#xD;
ty girl over whose heart even his ,wiles had' no influence, and at the risk&#xD;
~f his own life, bring her to his feet. H~e h~d remarked her devoted&#xD;
attention to Pierre, and upon that discovery based his plan of operation..&#xD;
his first measure was to gain such an ascendancy' over Pieue as wculd&#xD;
render, him submissive to his tvill. With-this object in view, he induced&#xD;
the young man to accompany him in a trading expedition among the&#xD;
Indians, and from thence to New Orleans. They left that city in a-&#xD;
sidff on their return homewards with about.three thousand dollars each,&#xD;
twquired by their trade and sundry gambling speculations of Robertson..&#xD;
Near the mouth of the Arkansas a young rnan.who caUed his name&#xD;
Martin came on board and requested a passage to New Madrid, the&#xD;
place of his. residence, offering to aid them in rowing. flis request&#xD;
was granted. On the second day after he came on board, Martin in-&#xD;
duced Pierre to gamble with him, at first for 'a mere trifle, and, at&#xD;
length for large stakes. 'The result is already anticipated. Young La-&#xD;
valle lost every dollar of his money, and~ was left ~ penniless beggar.&#xD;
The emotions of Pierre were but little ehort of freiizy. In this state&#xD;
of mind Robertson seized the opportunity, while Martin was at a&#xD;

THE FIRST CONVICT.                31&#xD;
&#xD;
30                VLAUDINE LAVALLE, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
tance on shore, to excite still higher the feelings of rage and despair&#xD;
that agitated the mind of young Lavalle. He expressed the greatest&#xD;
sorrow for his heavy loss, and told him that Martin had defrauded him&#xD;
out of his money by foul play, and consequently any means that could&#xD;
be taken to recover it were perfectly justifiable. In short, he succeeded&#xD;
in exciting the feelings of Pierre, till he agreed to entice Martin, who&#xD;
was very intemperate, to drink that night to intoxication, and when&#xD;
asleep from its influence, pitch him into the river, and divide the con-&#xD;
tents of his portmanteau between them..&#xD;
Night came. Pierre plied the gambler with wine until he appeared&#xD;
to be in the last stages of intoxication, and sunk down by the side of&#xD;
the boat feigning profound sleep. At a silent motion by Robertson,&#xD;
young Lavalle, pale and trembling, pitched the body overboard, which&#xD;
appeared to sink without a struggle. Pierre now brought forward&#xD;
Martin's portmanteau, that they might divide its contents between them;&#xD;
but what was his astonishment when Robertson not only refused any&#xD;
share of the money, but expressed the utmost surprise and horror at the&#xD;
deed, declaring that he had not entertained the remotest suspicion that&#xD;
Lavalle really contemplated committing such a crime, or he would have&#xD;
prevented it even by force.&#xD;
It was in vain that the wretched, tortured young man protested that&#xD;
Robertson had aided in the affair. The latter denied it with violence,&#xD;
and uttered dark threats against him if he again repeated such a false-&#xD;
hood. Pierre saw at once tl~at he had placed himself completely in the&#xD;
power of Robertson, aud sought to soothe him by abject entreaty.&#xD;
With apparent difficulty young Lavalle obtained from him a promise&#xD;
that he would not reveal the story to any one living, so long as Pierre&#xD;
tret~ted him as a friend. This was the utmost concession which the af..&#xD;
ffioted youth could obtain from one whom he knew in his heart was as&#xD;
guilty as he.&#xD;
Young Lavalle, by the refusal of Robertson to' share with him, would&#xD;
have the entire contents of Martin's portmanteau, which would contain&#xD;
not only tlw~ money won from himself, but that which previously belong-&#xD;
ed to the gambler. He opened the portmanteau, and was horror-struck&#xD;
to f1n4 that it contained only rubbish. Not a dollar ~vas there! What&#xD;
'he could have done with it or when disposed of it was a subject that ex-&#xD;
cited their curiosity and amazement, but to Pierre it was a terrible&#xD;
blow. He had been enticed by Robertson to comiimit the deed he had&#xD;
done to regain the money of which he had been swindled. He had&#xD;
placed himself in the power of Robertson, and yet had recovered noth-&#xD;
&#xD;
30&#xD;
&#xD;
al&#xD;
&#xD;
ing. besidess this, and his dependence upon him at present for all pe.~&#xD;
~uniary supplies, there was the consciousness of guilt bearing with a&#xD;
mountain~ weight upon his soul.&#xD;
All this affair had been planned between Robertson and Martin.&#xD;
Robertson was to assist Martin by signs to win Pierre's money, which&#xD;
they divided between them. In return for this service, Martin was to&#xD;
feign himself drunk,.&amp;amp;fter privately disposing of his money, and permit&#xD;
himself to be throwii overboard by Pierre. He found not the slightest&#xD;
difficulty in gaining the shore unperceived, leaving not a doubt on the&#xD;
mind of young Lavalle that he had sunk to rise no more.&#xD;
On the night of the murder of Pierre Lavalle, Robertson had con-&#xD;
certed a pI~t with the latter by which Claudine would be placed in his&#xD;
power. This plot was providentially overheard by Claudine, who was-&#xD;
thus put upon her guard. Robertson, who lurked at that hour near, the&#xD;
house, saw her in conversation with her uncle and aunt, from whom&#xD;
she received an axe, which he saw her take into her sleeping apart.&#xD;
ment, and heard her lock and barricade the door. He knew from these&#xD;
circumstances that the plot was discovered, and doubted not that Pierre,&#xD;
who had hesitated long between"the gallows and her betrayal, had .dis..&#xD;
closed the plot to his sister; and he resolved to take deadly revenge up~&#xD;
on both.&#xD;
Returning to the outhouse occupied by Pierre, he found no difficulty&#xD;
in inducing him to drink immoderately, and took the precaution to drug&#xD;
his wine. Long before midnight his intended victim was stretched out&#xD;
in his bed, in a profound 'sleep. Nothing but the dread of appearing&#xD;
before God with the guilt of murder upon his soul had made him the&#xD;
submissive slave of Robertson's will. On his knees he had implored&#xD;
him again and again to spare his sistei~, but the monster; true to his&#xD;
thirst for revenge, coldly bade him choose between obedience and death&#xD;
on the gallows.&#xD;
The room which Claudine now occupied had formerly been the sleep.&#xD;
lug apartment of Pierre, and was thus occupied by him when Robert~.&#xD;
son first arrived in St. Charles. He often slept there with young La-&#xD;
valle', after having spent the night, to a late hour, in debauchery.&#xD;
One day, in the .absence of Pierre, lie accid~*itally discovered that a.&#xD;
short plank of the floor, directly under the bed, and concealed from oh'-&#xD;
sOrvation, was loose.' On examination, it appeared probable that in lay.&#xD;
ing the floor, a plank of suiuible length was wanting, and saw-mills at&#xD;
that ~early period being few and far between, the deficiency was sup-&#xD;
plied by putting down a short piece~ at a place where the defect would&#xD;

&#xD;
escape notice. From some cause or other, but probably from an inten-&#xD;
tion to supply its place with a ph~nk of the requisite length, that piece&#xD;
had never been nailed to the sleep~r..&#xD;
Robertson instantly resolved to turn this discovery to his own advan-&#xD;
cage. The house was elevated so high above the ground, that by creep.&#xD;
ing undet~ the floor, an entrance into the room through that aperture&#xD;
would be easy. The uncle and sister of Pierre had already urged him&#xD;
to break off all intercourse with Robertson, and the latter determined&#xD;
that he would avail himself of the means which the short plank afforded&#xD;
of gaining an easy access to Pierre as often as he pleased, without the&#xD;
knowledge of the family. Being skillful in the manufacture of the&#xD;
tools of a burglar, he soon constructed a spring that held the plank firm-&#xD;
ly to its place. By pressing his thumb hard upon a knob connected&#xD;
with the spring, under the floor, this ingenious trap-door opened with-&#xD;
out noise. Every thing was so adroitly managed as to present no ap..&#xD;
pearance of any contrivance.&#xD;
On that night, when he saw that Claudine had become acquainted:&#xD;
with the plot which he and Pierre had devised, the trap-door, which had.&#xD;
long been forgotten, now occurred to his mind. He had never had any&#xD;
occasion to use this secret entrance, and its very existence bad passed.&#xD;
* from his recollection. He now resolved to employ it as the means of&#xD;
deadly revenge upon both the brother and ~ister.&#xD;
The solemn hour of midnight arrived. Stillness reigned over the&#xD;
scene. The whole household was sunk in profound sleep. Not a light&#xD;
was seen in the village, except at a single chamber, where a mother&#xD;
kept watch at the bed-side of her sick child. Slowly and cautiously&#xD;
Robertson crept under the floor of Claudine's apartment. He found the&#xD;
fatal spring. Rust and time had nearly tendered it immovable. I-Ic&#xD;
pressed 'hIs finger hard upon the knob, and at last the trap-door opened.&#xD;
Creeping through that aperture, he stood erect at the bed-side of his in-&#xD;
tended victim. The curtains of her window ~ver~ indeed, closely drawn,&#xD;
but the full moon rode high in the clear and cloudless heavens, render.&#xD;
ing every object in the room distinctly visible. Upon a chair, neatly&#xD;
arranged~ lay the articles of her toilet, as she had placed them. on retir.~-&#xD;
ing for the night. Directly over the head of her bed hung a crucifix,&#xD;
a~d below it an image of the Blessed Virgin, to whose guardian care&#xD;
she nightly committed herself and all she loved, with the most child-&#xD;
like confidence and affection. He gazed long and earnestly upon c~lau-~&#xD;
dire, who slept, unconscious of the presence of her deadly foe. The&#xD;
of triumph and security with which she had surveyed her firmly.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
32&#xD;
&#xD;
,:barricaded door still rested, upon her lips. 11cr breathing was soft and&#xD;
peaceful as that of an infant pillowed upon the bosom of its mother.&#xD;
Taking with him the fatal axe, ltobertson descended and carefully&#xD;
closed the trap-door. In examining the spot' to see that no marks or&#xD;
traces were left that might lead to his detection, he discovered, that one&#xD;
of her shoes and an article of her dress had fallen through the opening.&#xD;
This suggested to him the idea ef employing them as evidence, against&#xD;
her. Taking these with him, he repaired to the out-house, and placing&#xD;
them near the bed, he perpetrated the foul murder of Pierre Lavalle, by&#xD;
cleaving his skull asunder, inflicting numerous ghastly wounds, and fi.&#xD;
nally severing the head entirely from the body. He then stained the&#xD;
handle of the axe with the blood of his victim, replaced it under the bed&#xD;
of Claudine, carefully fastened the trap-door, and 'then hastened from&#xD;
the village. He arrived at Prairie Des Sioux before his absence was&#xD;
discovered, or even suspected..&#xD;
Such was the substance of that part of his confession which bears&#xD;
an immediate Connection with this story. Hardly had he finished his&#xD;
narration when he expired in great agony of body and mind, despairing&#xD;
of the mercy of God.&#xD;
Col. D'Iberville and his wife returned home, deeply affected with the&#xD;
scene they bad witnessed. Claudine sought the soJitude of her cham-&#xD;
ber, and throwing herself upon her knees, poured forth l~er gratitude to&#xD;
that Power who had shielded her in the fearful hour of peril, and in his&#xD;
own good time removed from her name the dark stains that rested on&#xD;
it. Tears flowed copiously as the scenes of other years rose up in Viv-&#xD;
id recollection before her. flut they were teats of gratitude, and de~&#xD;
seceded upon her heart like the gentle dew-drops that evening shec~&#xD;
upon the drooping flowers. The blight upon her name that had poison~&#xD;
ed all her happiness was now removed. She had lived in continual&#xD;
fear that some accident might disclose to the world that Madam lYlber.&#xD;
yule, the honored, talented Madam D'Iberville, was no athe~. than the&#xD;
Claudine Lavalle who had been condemned to death for the mu~de* of&#xD;
her brother, and escaped the gallows only by the timely pardon otth9&#xD;
(Thvernor. The disgrace which such a discovery would bring~ iipoii&#xD;
their son, a high~spirited lad of eighteen, could not be contemplated&#xD;
without dread. The thought would often steal over her, that her own&#xD;
husband, fond and devoted as he had always been, had no proof of lid'&#xD;
innocence but her bare word, and that in opposition to a jury of twelve&#xD;
men, who cm their oath declared her guilty.&#xD;
~ql~ D'Ibervjlle rejoiced in this happy event even more than his wife1&#xD;

~To nee~led no new proof to convince him that "Sister MarieH a~&#xD;
delighted in calling her, was little less than perfect.&#xD;
Claudine descended to the parlor, and at her request, CoL D'lbevvilh~&#xD;
i~olc their son into a private apartment, and disclosed to him the early&#xD;
historyy of his mother. The young man was deeply affected, and, rush-&#xD;
~ng into* the chamber to which his mother had retired, with his face&#xD;
i~athed in tears, exclaimed, "Oh mother, mother, how much I love you&#xD;
~or what you have snifered," and he kissed her again and again wi&amp;amp;&#xD;
fond affection. Her cup ot happiness now seemed full, and the long&#xD;
$~ears ol' sorrbw she had endured were amply repaid by the joys of that hour.&#xD;
Her cup was destined to receive another and an exquisite drop of&#xD;
i.~appiness. As she descended again to the parlor, leaning on the arm&#xD;
bf her husband and son, a loud knocking wa&amp;amp; heard at the door. It&#xD;
was opened, and the Superipr of the Sisters of Charity, whom she had&#xD;
t~o lately visited, entered, and with her a venei~able ecclesiastic, appar.&#xD;
~ntly bordering upon eighty years. It was the venerated priest of St..&#xD;
charles, the good Father Laroche, the friend and guardian of Claudine&#xD;
Lavalle. He felt that his pilgrimage on earth would soon close, and he&#xD;
was anxious to place in the hands of Col. D'Iberville and his lady the&#xD;
account ofhis inanagemeiit of her property, which had so niuch increas'-&#xD;
~A in value. He ardently desired to behold once more on earth the or-&#xD;
~han girl whom he had so fondly cherished, and also his sister, his on-&#xD;
ly surviving kindred. Father Laroche had brought with him the final&#xD;
i~ecision of the courts in his favor, as residuary legatee of the estate of&#xD;
Claudine's father, to a tract of land, a Spanish gwant, which had beeom~r&#xD;
immensely valuable. This property was now hers.&#xD;
It need not be told with what emotions that venerable priest wa~ re~-&#xD;
i;arded by all the family of Madam D'Iberville. They entreated him&#xD;
o spend the remainder of his life with them, where they could have th~&#xD;
happiness of paying him some small sifare o~ the immense debt of grat-&#xD;
tude they owed him, for his' firm, unshaken confidence in the truthful&#xD;
integrityy of Claudine Lavalle, when all things conspired to prove her guilt.&#xD;
That night, as they were about to retire, this little household,, moved&#xD;
)y the same impulse, threw themselves upon their knees, while thc&#xD;
priest offered to the IThseen Power who had shielded, the iu~enSe or&#xD;
gratitude. The venerable Father LarQche closed his benediction with&#xD;
t~his affecting quotation from Scripture: "Once was I young, who ant&#xD;
~tow old; but never yet kave I seen the wicked prr~per, the righteov~i&#xD;
f@rsakcn."&#xD;

ttactive excited no envy, malice, or ili'wilL T~ s~rne of her neighbors,&#xD;
and especially of her Own seX, the ~hrubbery and flowers of ~he litt~o&#xD;
wOman were really gall r~d worm.wood. Unkind remarks upon the&#xD;
uhje~t ~re not urtfrequently made to Mary herself bun more fre~&#xD;
quently they reached her ear through the ofiicio~s zeal of some visitor,&#xD;
who professed to be the defender of the abused Jittle WQiD&amp;amp;fl, '~'hese&#xD;
reports produced but a slight and momentary impression. upon the mind&#xD;
of Mrs. Maverick, wh~ listened to thorn With n smile, an4 not un&#xD;
frequently, when anything rixore than usually spiteful was ur~re4, burst&#xD;
into a mery laugh, and in tem min~xtes forgot all about it. It was far&#xD;
otherwise with her husband. He felt these~carpings of envy and malive&#xD;
more deeply than he was willing to confess~ and it sometimes required&#xD;
all her ~oothirj influence, which she knew well how to exert, to induce&#xD;
him to refrain from openly expressing his resentment to her detractors.&#xD;
One evening a neighboring lady called upon them, at a time when Mrs.&#xD;
l~averick chanced to be watering a large and beautiful moss rose,&#xD;
whose' numerous bi us filled the whole room with their fragrance.&#xD;
"Is not that beai.uifnl, Mrs. Jones?" ex&amp;amp;lairned the delighted husband&#xD;
to their visitor, pointing to the rose. The walk of that lady through the&#xD;
yard, between rows of shrubs and flowers, had already excited her ilb&#xD;
hurnor~ which instantly broke forth at the rexn~rlt of the gratified hns~.&#xD;
band. "Oh yes," she exclaimed, "beautiful, no doubt; but anybody&#xD;
can have just suchjf they choose. I ~ouM plant shrubbery just a~well&#xD;
as your wife, Mr. Mtiverick, but I have something else to dq. Mei.y&#xD;

her household duties for these mnu~eni~nts~ was rather more ~ha~ the&#xD;
patience of her husband, ccril4 bear. It was the drop to xrn~tclx tli&amp;amp;&#xD;
made the cup overflow. Maverick instantly sprang freta his peat, aa~d~&#xD;
spitee of i~i~ look of entreaty from his Wife, bowing with mock defer-&#xD;

religious toleration. liesides, if thus denied the use of'the school house,&#xD;
public sympathy would instantly be awakened in behalf 6f 'the preacher,&#xD;
and a dozen houses at on6e be thrown open to him,, giving to MormonV&#xD;
ism a teti-fold greater influence, than it would otherwise have. The sun&#xD;
was hardly an hour high, and he ha:d rip time to go over the settlement&#xD;
and try to persuade' the people not to attend the preaching, even if such a&#xD;
course promised success~ At~ any ~rate, he could insure the abseiice of&#xD;
one tatnily. His seat and that of his wife sI'. ould be vacant, and thus set&#xD;
a silent, but most impressive 'seal upon the attendance 'of all who were&#xD;
present-a' condemnation which would haire a decided influence against&#xD;
Mormonism.' Such was hi~ resolve~ in the absence of 'all other means&#xD;
of warding off the threatened calamity.&#xD;
Few, perhaps, would have anticipated any opposition to this arrange-&#xD;
ment from the gentle Mary~ lint oppose it she 'did.' She had felt no&#xD;
desire to attend ~he meeting; but the moment her 'husband, in an arbi~&#xD;
trar~r 'mann~r~ resolved, without consulting her at all, that she should&#xD;
stay at home, an' ardent desire to hear the Mormon 'took possession of&#xD;
her heart. She attempted to reason him out of' his exclusion, but in&#xD;
vain. Though yielding as the sensitive plant at 'the' voice of ~kindness,&#xD;
the little woman could be firm and immovable as the Rock of Gibraltar,&#xD;
when her rights were disreg'.arded, and her feelings touched by a rude&#xD;
hand. On such an occasion an instantaneous change came over her&#xD;
~vhole being. She uttered no complaints, no reproaches, but her Whole&#xD;
soul seemed to retire within itself.-&#xD;
We cannot determine what course either of them would have pursued,&#xD;
or which yielded, for just at this moment a new actor in the scene en-&#xD;
tered, and changed the entire current of passing events.&#xD;
This was no other than Frank Maverick, the youngest and favorite&#xD;
brother, a warm-hearted, intelligent youth of seventeen, who carried&#xD;
sunshine with him wherever he went, and was every 'where a welcum&amp;amp;&#xD;
guest;&#xD;
Filled with excitement at the novelty of hearing a follower of Joe'&#xD;
Smith, and eht'ed with the anticipation of seeing a crowd of people atthe&#xD;
meeting, he cri~d' 'Out before lie crossed his brother's threshold, "get&#xD;

"how beautiful your flowers have grown. If ever 1 look Out for a&#xD;
wife, I mean to try to find one just like you, and the very flr~t question&#xD;
I intend to ask her is, whether she is fond of flowers.". "Ah~ brother&#xD;
Frank!" replied Mary with an arch smile, "I half suspect that you have&#xD;
just come from taking a lesson on flowers from pretty Luey Mills, and&#xD;
that she gave you the ruse you wear so jauntily in the button-hole of&#xD;
your ve~t, just over your heart." The young man blushed deeply at&#xD;
his shrewd guess of sister Mary, but laughed aloud, and, to conceal his&#xD;
consciousness that she had hit the very truth, lie seized little Eddy, who&#xD;
had run in- from the garden at the welcome sound of "Un~le Frank's"&#xD;
voice, and s~vinging the chuid over his shoulder, trotted out of the house&#xD;
with Eddy upon his back.&#xD;

had ailvanished. His long hours of sleepless excitement were remem~&#xD;
bered witfi astonishment and mortification at his owt~ weakness of mind~&#xD;
The approaching 'visit of the Mormon was now regarded in 'it~ tine&#xD;
ght, as an affair, indeed, of no earthly consequence, one way' or the'&#xD;
other-a very trifiing, unimportant ~vent. He c6uld hardly believe it&#xD;
possible that he could have given it a moment's attention.&#xD;
After 'breakfast, Mr. Mav~'rick occupied himself with' labors in sight&#xD;
of the house, in momentary expectation of the arrival of "the preacher.&#xD;
Hour after houi' rolled by, and noon came, but no visitor. "He had -&#xD;
promised to call early in the morning, and th.~y now concluded that he&#xD;
had abandoned the intention of visiting them, and 'gon~ sortie live miles&#xD;
distant 5 the road towards Alton to the place at which he had appointed&#xD;
to preach that night. They were' congratulating themselves, ~oon"aftei~:&#xD;
dinner, that they bad fortunately escaped an interview s'o uhwelc&amp;amp;ie,&#xD;
when s~iddenly and unexpectedly a stranger entered th~ opeii "door.&#xD;
For an instant Maverick gazed upon him with speechless surprise, then,'&#xD;
uttering' the exclamation, "Wk~,! .M~'. Wilmer."' sprang from his meat,&#xD;
seized the hand of the stranger, and shook it with the nio~t' cordial' g~'at-&#xD;

when he learned, to his o\verwh~hi'ik~ astonishment, that this Wa's no&#xD;
other than the Morqion preacher wjio had lisid 'f~rth to" the~ ~p~6~le' of&#xD;
the settlement the night beforee~ at the schoolhouse. Among al hi~iiu.'&#xD;

objections. Had it been otherwise, Maverick would.have made a de..&#xD;
cided effort W prevent it.&#xD;
~No attempt was made that afternoon to. discuss the doctyines of the&#xD;
Mormon ,~creed, but many preliminary inquiries about the sect, and of&#xD;
their general character, were made. After tea, Maverick 'and Wiliner&#xD;
set out for the place of meeting. . It was dark when th.ey arrived. ~'The&#xD;
candles were already 'lighted up. A crowd bad' collected.. On theout.&#xD;
side. of the hou~e, groups of men and full-grown boys were, clustered,&#xD;
discussing in a loud tone the subject of the meeting. The .ru4e, coarse&#xD;
jokes uttered against the Mormons were, received with boisterous ap-&#xD;
plause.&#xD;
The preacher passed through the crowd at the door, entered ~the&#xD;
house, and took his seat at a desk on the opposite side of~ the room.&#xD;
Giving .no heed to the, loud whispering and tittePrig, he commenced&#xD;
by singing a hymn, after which he opened the Bikle,~and read~the tenth&#xD;
chapter of Luke. To 'the disappointment 'of no small 'number, who&#xD;
caine there for sport, instead 'oft a portion of the', Book of Mormon 'or&#xD;
the Golden Plates, they heard only a deeply impressive chapter from&#xD;
the. New Test~inent.. The reading ended, he paused for a moment,&#xD;
then. saying, "let us pray," knelt, down. There was nothing in the&#xD;
simple 'act of a minister's kneeling to excite attention, for the practice&#xD;
was common. ,The whole congregation had been.. accustomed to. that.&#xD;
mode froin~their infancy~ But the manner in which that sirt~ple act was&#xD;
perEormed ~ the Morn~ion was striking. There was deep. humility of&#xD;
soul. ir~ every attitnde~and inotioir. .It.seemed as. if he. wished to pros-&#xD;
t.rate himself in the very dust before Him whom he was about to address.&#xD;
But theprayer, the prayer itself, was still more striking and. peculiar.&#xD;
Itwas uttered in a low, deep tone, but every ivord was distinctly audible&#xD;
at the remotest corner of the room. He seemed to hava forgotten&#xD;
that an audience was around him, prepared to criticise every. ,~or.d he&#xD;
uttered, but appeared to remember only that he was in the presence&#xD;
of the Deity.&#xD;
Many of the serious portion of the congregation were affected, and&#xD;
even the young men and overgrown boys, who came there for sport,&#xD;
were awed 4nto silence.&#xD;
He took .a 'text from the Bible, a verse of the same chapter that ~e&#xD;
had just read. in a serm~m of nearly an hour and a half long, ,he ex-&#xD;
plained the grounds upon which .the Iaatter-Day Saints, the followers of&#xD;
'Jo Srniih%. founded their belief in Mormonism. These doctrines he&#xD;
efended with an ingenuity of argument, and an eloquence that wanted&#xD;
&#xD;
bt~t- the simple ingredient of irutk to r~d~r it ~ mo4el of i~t4i~it ~&#xD;
Unexpectedly to all,. he professed t~ receive the QId and ~I~4~w ~Festa~&#xD;
ments as the word of God, and drew from the j~ible it Wa~h4w ?rP~fs&#xD;
which he adduced in support Of the Mormon cro~ed. ir~it~a~Wp pas~&#xD;
sages were quoted by huiufrom the Bible, which he iagen~on~ly euq~k'yeti&#xD;
to sustain their peciUiar doctrines, and 'like authenticity of ~he&#xD;
Mbrinon. They termed themselves "t~atLer.4I)s.y Saints," 'he said, in&#xD;
reference to the near approach of the "Latter Pay," when the 4ng~l,&#xD;
with one foot upon the land and the other on the sea, should decla~&#xD;
that time should be no longer. Many striking pa~sa~es of S~ripturo&#xD;
were adduced in support of this, and especi~dly frcnl the prophetic.&#xD;
books of the Old Testament. The last days of the earth were at their&#xD;
very doors. With ingenious sophistry, various passages which lie quoted.&#xD;
from the Bible were seemingly made to prove that, shortly btifore the&#xD;
conflagration of the ~ vo4d, and the consummation of all thing ~, a new&#xD;
revela~jor~ was to came to light, and a people arise, p~qf~ssirg a purer&#xD;
faith, upon whom would be conferred the power 'of healingg' the sick~&#xD;
speaking in unknown tongues, and performing va4ous other i~iiraeles.&#xD;
This sermon was delivered with all that earnest fervor which .~su~l~y&#xD;
characterizes the words and action~ of him who is thQroughly conyineed&#xD;
of the truth of what he utters, and de~ply'~feels its iInportane~.. .411'&#xD;
seen~ed' to listen vith serious attention~ . The levity .esliibited so&#xD;
quivocally in the early part of the e~ei4ng had alt disappeared, ai~d&#xD;
those who came .fqr the purpose of making sport, an4 turning alt ~he&#xD;
services into ridicule, returned home a~ the close. g the ~er~t9ik, sii~nt&#xD;
and thoughtful. Some of the most :yespecta14~ of the ~i~iz~ ~x~e&#xD;
l'orw~xd, and invited the preacher to visit that place again.&#xD;
Upon the mind of no one, perhaps, was there made so profound an&#xD;
impression, as upon that of James Maverick. He knew the preacher,&#xD;
and~ he knew, also, the sacrifices, more cruel than martyrdotn itself,&#xD;
which the preacher had made for that which he d~eme4 ~ ~ru~ ~&#xD;

citeinent began to prevail. FWe men, with their wives, all of whom&#xD;
were mem era ~f'otthedox churches, came forward, and publicly con-&#xD;
fessed themselves converts to Mormonisin. These were baptized by&#xD;
Mr. Wiltuer, for the Mormons acknowledged not the validity of the&#xD;
rite. performed by any sect or denomination.' After this they were&#xD;
received 'into the church of the Latter-Day Saints. Other candidates&#xD;
Were expected soon to follow. The opposition to Mormonism now broke&#xD;
forth with redoubled violence.&#xD;
Good ,m~n looked on with fear and trembling, for no one knew where&#xD;
this delushn would end.. None of'the oppos~rs of that sect were more&#xD;
implacable and unrelenting in their hostility to Mormonism, in all its&#xD;
various phases, than was Judge Maverick. He was a man of a sound&#xD;
head, and of sincere piety, but without a~ particle of charity for Joe&#xD;
7-Sinith, or any intelligent man who preached his doctrines. He 1?Iamed&#xD;
his son James, severely blamed him, for harboring Wilmer, or listening&#xD;
to his preaching. Not even the hospitality shown to him by that man&#xD;
could justify' him for inviting him to his house. The mother of young&#xD;
Maverick 'wept over him, and with anguish of heart implored him to&#xD;
'avoid the Mormons, for it would "kill her and his wife both," she said,&#xD;
if he should be deluded by their sophistry, and join the odious sect.&#xD;
James *as already aware of the feelings of Mary upon that subject,&#xD;
for, though she had forborne from speaking of the Mormons for a long&#xD;
time past, yet' the increasing paleness of her countenance, and her de-&#xD;
jbcted 'appearance, 'betrayed the deep anguish with Which she beheld&#xD;
his frequent associations with the Latter-Day Saints. He was greatly&#xD;
affected at the sight of his mothers tears, for he had never before seen&#xD;
her weep as she did now, and solemnly promised her that he would go&#xD;
no more to 'their meetings, and hold no more intercourse with any of&#xD;
the sect1&#xD;
The joy of his mother at this promise of her son was great. 'She&#xD;
went directly to his house, and communicated the intelligence to Mary,&#xD;
who was 'nearly overcome with this' 'unexpected happiness. She em-&#xD;
braced her mother~in-Iaw, ~nd wept tears of joy and hope upoii her&#xD;
bosom1&#xD;
Young ~Maveticl faithfully kept his pledge, much to the grief and&#xD;
sore disappointment of Wilmer and the rest of the Mormons residing&#xD;
in 'that settlement, who had counted largely upon the weight and influ-&#xD;
ence which his joining them would'~giv-e to Mormonism in that region.&#xD;
lie not only fulfilled, his promise, but fulfilled it to t~e yery letter and&#xD;

And the tears, to-day by Memory 8hed,&#xD;
Fall only on their tMn."-Moo~~e.&#xD;
Several months have gone by siAce the departure of Whiner from'&#xD;
the settlement of Sixteen Mile PraiAe, in which period the ~ver-~ary-&#xD;
i~~ig features of Mormonism have assumed still another hue. "The&#xD;
G~ft of Tongues," as it was styled, no longer confined to one or two of&#xD;
their most popular preachers, had even become general. The most&#xD;
illiterate of their members, men and women who were unable to read&#xD;
a single wdrd of their own native English, and even children, c6uld&#xD;
prophesy fluently, it was said, in Hebrew, Gteek, Chaldee, '~yria6, an4&#xD;
numerous other lai~guages. This was no~ attempted at all ~their' med-&#xD;
ings. Sometimes, the individual wh~ uttered the strain of u~hi~i~&#xD;
sounds professed to give the meaning, himself, in English; ~htit more&#xD;
&amp;amp;6mnionly, the "interpve~ation," as it was called, was given by ~Oxne' one&#xD;
else. The excitement of the public mind was manifested by scenes of&#xD;
violence which no native American can remember without shame and&#xD;
mortification, for mobs and lynch law became the order of the day.&#xD;
But these violent and illegal measures had the effect which all attempts&#xD;
to change the religious opinions of men by physical ' force ever have&#xD;
had. In frequent instances, the meetings of 'the Mormons for public&#xD;
worship, though held in their own houses, were broken up; and fortunate&#xD;
indeed were the inmates if they escaped aiiy worse outrage. In vain&#xD;
did the victims appeal for 'protection to the laws of their country.&#xD;
Our institutions, which guarantee the freedoni of religious 'ophii6n to&#xD;
the Jew, the Mahometan, the Pagan, and even to the ./It1,eis#,' afi~rded'&#xD;
no protection to the Mormon. Their own dv~"eIlings might be iiivaded~&#xD;
their wives and daughters insulted and abused, their windows brok-e1~&#xD;

heads, with perfect impunity. Few magistrates will risk the certain&#xD;
loss of votes at the next election, merely to protect the rights of men&#xD;
without influence, against the injustice of tI~e muit~tu~1e, whe~hr these&#xD;
hapless victims of mob law art Mormons or not.&#xD;
But the Latter-Day Saints increased but' the mere rapidly Lex these&#xD;
persecutions, and the consequence of it was, that prosel.ytes were added&#xD;
to their church in nearly every place that their preachers visited. Some&#xD;
few of the Mormons, even at this early period, had lost their lives, and&#xD;
most of them held life and property only at the will of an American&#xD;
mob.&#xD;
Under the direction of Joe Smith, the Latter-Day Saints had settled,&#xD;
in great numbers, in one of the counties of Missouri, high up the river&#xD;
of the same name. Here it was the intention of the Prophet ~o found&#xD;
a Mormon colony, which should become the permanent "Head Quar-&#xD;
ters" of the Order Lor all time to come. Many hundred families had&#xD;
arrived there from the various States of the Union, purchased ~ piece&#xD;
of land, 'a~nd witW gi~eat industry applied therns~elves to i~s cultivation.&#xD;
At the period of which we are 'now speaking, the p~qp~e of that part of&#xD;
Missouri had, not lQng before, assembled em mass~, 4rive~i these Mor-&#xD;
mons from their homes, and compelled them to leav t.~e~ion. They-&#xD;
gave them permission, however, to settle in a 91eu) 4I4~ uminWibited&#xD;
county of the State, on the extreme frontier, adjoining the territory of&#xD;
various savage tribes; pledging their honor to the Mormons, that in that&#xD;
distaut retreat they 'should never be molested.&#xD;
Conducted by 'the Prophet, who marched at their head, always ready&#xD;
tu share~ with his PAlowers whatever toils and dangers awaited them~&#xD;
these Mormon Pilgrims, with their wives and children, and the scanty&#xD;
remains of earthly goods still left them, took up the long and melancholy&#xD;
line of their march to the Indian frontier. Here they applied them~eWes&#xD;
with the persevering industry that has ever formed a distinguishing&#xD;
trait in the character of the sect, and before ma:ny moons had wamed and&#xD;
waned, every thing in that wild region h~d assumed a new and plea-&#xD;
sing ~ppearance. Each family had its own allotment of ground, upon&#xD;
which there soon arose- a neat dwelling, and~ variouS other improve-&#xD;
ments.&#xD;
But the M~rm0ns scatts~ied over the United StRt~s, most of them the&#xD;

the Prophet. To effect that -purpose, he resolved to call them all,~with&#xD;
as little delay as possible, to that place,, wl~ich he had established as&#xD;
the' "Zion" of the sect. Smith had a new revelation ftom Heairenin-&#xD;
forming him 'that the time was now neat at hand'when the Destroying&#xD;
Angel would pass over the earth, when the wicked should be cutoff in&#xD;
their sins, and the saints above possess the earth. M~sengers were&#xD;
sent in every direction, where Mormon converts were found, to proclaim&#xD;
to them, in the word~ of the Prophet, "came out from among the wicked,&#xD;
my people, for why willye perish, with them-come up to the Zion&#xD;
which the Lord thy God has establishecV for his saints." The unbelie-&#xD;
ving world, too, must be warned forthe last time: "get ye up, flee to the&#xD;
mountains, lest ye be con&amp;amp;uraed; for the great and terrible day of God's&#xD;
wrath is coming quickly, when the unbelieving world shall be utterly cut&#xD;
off." Such were the messages to "saint ner," proclaimed abroad&#xD;
by the preacher sent out by Smith. Nor was the mission fruitless in&#xD;
converts. Instead of ~iirging the people, as formerly, to ~mbrac~ their&#xD;
doctrines, they' now assumed a different 'tone, ~v~rnimig th~tn not to&#xD;
joih'the ranks of~ 'the tatter-t~ay Saints, unless they were ready t~. lay&#xD;
down their lives, like the martyrs of old and seal the bonds o~ faith&#xD;
with their 'own' blood. Other sects, said they, could i~epose on "flowery&#xD;
beds" of ease," but the Latter-Day Saints have nothing tO expect from&#xD;
the world but persecution and death. 'And this language' was not&#xD;
out effect; for such is human nature, that persecution and bloodshed'have&#xD;
always increased the persecuted sect. Employ force and violence to&#xD;
put down the ~vild~-st delusion that fanaticism ever invented, and you&#xD;
in'~vitably insure its success. The h story of the world attests tha~t fruth.&#xD;
It is strikingly verified in the case of the Mormons. Hundreds whb&#xD;
ridiculed the absurdities of that creed when its followers were unmo-&#xD;
lested, fell directly into the snare of Mormonism v~rhen their sympathies&#xD;
were awakened by seeing them calmly enduring persecution and death&#xD;
for the cause.&#xD;
In all human probability, had, the followers of Joe Smith been left&#xD;
to pursue the dictates of- their own consciences, unmolested and undis-&#xD;
turbed, as so many other religionists&#xD;
do-in all prob'                 ~equally absurd have done, and yet&#xD;
ability, had not the Mormons, been assailed with perse-&#xD;
cution, the plunder of their property by American lynch law, and n~ade&#xD;
to suffer death-in all proba~~ility, the figment of the Golden Plates&#xD;
would long since have been forgotten, and the very name ~f Joe smith&#xD;
perished from the meniory~ of man. The, wildest an4 mOst.- absurd&#xD;

he was aroused from his reverie by the voice of his wife, calling him by&#xD;
name. Alarmed at hjs long absence, 4e had sought him ~t the 'house'&#xD;
of their nearest neighbor, and there earned that near sunset he had&#xD;
been seen sitting down in his field, and thither she hastened, in the&#xD;
utmost alarm. The ~cold dews on his thin dress had chilled him, and&#xD;
when aroused by the voice 'of his wife, he shivered like one under the&#xD;
influence of the ague. 'Yo her anxious inquiries, he merely replied&#xD;
that h&amp;amp; was unwell; begged~ her to feel no disquietude on his account,&#xD;
and accompanied her to the house. Mrs. Maverick kneW itothing of&#xD;
his interview with the old preaclIer in' the field, and had not the slightest&#xD;
suspicion that the subject of Mormonism occupied his Ihoughts. For&#xD;
several months he had attended none' of their meetings, and avoided&#xD;
having any intercourse with the members, and most devoutly did she&#xD;
thank God that he had escaped their 'si~iares. She' did not even dream&#xD;
that the fearful warnings of the old preacher, and his denunciations of&#xD;
impending destruction, at that very moment agitated her husband's&#xD;
mind, nearly driving him to frenzy and despair. She attributed his long&#xD;
stay in 'the field' to sudden illness. and would have employed a'ineighbor&#xD;
to go for the physician, but this he' peremptorily forbid, 'assuring her&#xD;
that he would be entirely well again after a night's rest. At supper,&#xD;
to quiet the fears of his wife, he attempted to eat,' but the effort~ wa~&#xD;
beyond his power to accomplish. Food w~s loathesoi~e to his' sight.&#xD;
He drank part of a cup of tea, and retired to bed. Mary would have&#xD;
prepared for him some of the prescriptions which she had 'so often found&#xD;
efficacious, but he declined taking them. To avoid further importunities'&#xD;
of his anxious wife, he closed his eyes and feigned sleep.&#xD;
It was' a long and dreary night to James Maverick. Every moment&#xD;
when awake, the" warning voice of the aged.. Mormon was sounding its&#xD;
fearful knell in his ears, telling him of his doom. Every look, every&#xD;
gesture of the old preacher was still present to his view. The moment&#xD;
he fell into asluinber, the woe~ denounced upon him by. the white-haired&#xD;
priest 'were a~l living realities, and thefr fulfillment was already begun.&#xD;
He saw th&amp;amp; separation made between the "sheep and the 'goats"~-4he&#xD;
wicked cut off-and none now remaining o~ the face of The purified&#xD;
earth but the Latter-Day Saints, who w~ere the sole tenants of a sinkss&#xD;
w6rld, 'prepared for their reshtence alone.&#xD;
In the morning, Maverick rose at dawn, and mechanically perforrn~d&#xD;
the usual jobs about the ~iou~e. At breakfast he ate little, and his wife&#xD;
saw wit alarm his haggard appearance. Shortly" afterward complain-&#xD;
ing of head-ache, he laid himself upon the bed. In an hour more, a&#xD;

*     *&#xD;
&#xD;
During the early part of 'his illness, Maverick neither spok6 'iwr&#xD;
uttered a single. ~~ord, or an exclamation of pain. He lay silent and&#xD;
still, his glaring eyes fixed, with fdgl~tfiil intensity, upon vacancy.&#xD;
his lips moved, at times, as if he were talking to the invisible being&#xD;
upon which he gazed, but no sound was heard.&#xD;
At length, a change came over the suffering patient. He began to&#xD;
move restlessly in his bed, and at times muttered wildly and incohe..&#xD;
rently.&#xD;
One night, during this period in his disorder, about an hour after&#xD;
friidnight, Mary and Judge Maverick were-keeping watch, alone; in the&#xD;
sick room. The mother, worn out with fatigue and anxiety, had retired&#xD;
to rest in an.adjoihing room. A' neighboring woman, who had dome&#xD;
there to watch' for the night, finding 'it impossible to keep awake; had&#xD;
lain 'down upon the bed iii which slept the elder Mrs. Maverick, and&#xD;
-7'&#xD;
&#xD;
THfl ~RIkts OF MAR~t ~MA~ERICI(I&#xD;
burning ~fever was raging in his veins. A messenger was sent to his&#xD;
parents,~who imin~diately dispatched Frank for Dr. Horion; ~d 'set ~i1i&#xD;
instantly for flue h9use of their sep. When 'they arrivea, James gazed&#xD;
long and' earnestly upon his father, and mother, but there was no' intel-&#xD;
lignce in the glazed' eye he cast upon his pareias. He did nof kn6w&#xD;
them.&#xD;
The doctor, on examining the symptoms of his patient, pronounced his&#xD;
disorder a. br ai ~i fever, 'a~nd immediately went to work, with vigor and&#xD;
skill, to combat the disease. He shaved the patient's head, applied blis-&#xD;
ters, and ~employed 'other means of a dePletory character. But faint&#xD;
hopes of his i'e cpvery were entertained by Dr. Horton.&#xD;
For days the attendance of the physician was unremitting, except&#xD;
for an hour or two daily, when he returned home for a few minutes,&#xD;
and' made a brief visit to a. patient near by, who was conv~iescent, a&#xD;
out of all danger.&#xD;
Little Eddy, at the commencement of his father's illness, was sent to&#xD;
,the care of 11 is aunt, that the undivided attention of his mother might&#xD;
be bestowed upon her sick husband. Judge Maverick passed the nights'&#xD;
at the house of his son, a'nd on his return home in the morning, Frauk&#xD;
was sent there to assist his mother and Mary during the day, an4 that&#xD;
hc might be l)resent, should any unexpected emergency arise to de-&#xD;
mand his aid. These two women, the wife and the mother, were&#xD;
constantly nt the bed-side of the sick man, except when exhausted nature&#xD;
required repoSe, when in turn they snatched a few hours of rest.&#xD;

~IIJfl MOflMG~ESS; O1~,&#xD;
was instantly Last asleep. All was still throughout the house, a:'.d not a&#xD;
sound was heard but The heavy breathing of the sick man. Suddenly he&#xD;
.tarted-raised himself up in the bed, threw his naked arms wildly&#xD;
around, and cried out, in the most appalling tones ever uttered ~by&#xD;
mortal voice, "The judgment! the judgment has come! Hark! its jeai&#xD;
is suun~ling!" At that very instant a thunder storm that had long&#xD;
been rolling up unperceived by them, suddenly burst forth in a blinding&#xD;
flash, followed by a peal of thunder that seemed to shake the solid globe&#xD;
down to its very core. Mary heard something fall heavily behind her.&#xD;
Judgo Maverick had fainted. But she had no time to attend to him,&#xD;
for her husband, in his insane ravings, was attempting to rise from his&#xD;
bed, and rush out into the storm that was now raging with violence.&#xD;
She dared not call aloud for aid, lest her cry should render the frenzy&#xD;
of her delirious husband uncontrollable. Seizing a pitcher of water that&#xD;
stood near her, on the table, she dashed its contents into the face of&#xD;
Judge Maverick, and instantly resumed her place at the bed-side of the&#xD;
maniac.&#xD;
fI~he Judge quickly revived, and sat up. Happily, the thunder clap&#xD;
awoke the mQther, who hastily put on her clothes and repaired to the&#xD;
sick room.&#xD;
All the remaining part of that long, long night, the patient raved in&#xD;
delirium. It was no .v, for the first time, that his wife ~nd parents be-&#xD;
came aware of the visit of the Mormon preacher to young Maverick,&#xD;
in the field. His ravings disclosed to them the startling fact, that the&#xD;
awful denunciations and warnings of the aged priest had unsettled his&#xD;
reason, and were still preying upon his life. In his delirium, the sick&#xD;
man repeated all that th~ Mormon had utterQd, and often called aloud&#xD;
to the old man, implp+ing him, in the most moving terms, to have mercy&#xD;
upon him, and spare him from the doom he had pronounce1.&#xD;
In the 2 urse of the night, his ravings suddenly changed. He n-ow&#xD;
iiytagined that father and mflher, wife and child, had all res )lVed to&#xD;
leav&amp;amp;hirn if he united with the ~ [ormons, and he implored his wife, by&#xD;
th memory-of their early love-by all his undying affection for her, and&#xD;
for their ouXy child, not to cast him off. His supplications to Mary were&#xD;
heartrending, and almost beyond her powers of endurance, though she&#xD;
was Lully aware that his entreaties to her were only the ravings of a&#xD;
disordered intellect. She threw her arms around his neck, and weeping&#xD;
upon his bosom, exclaimed, "Oh no! no! my poor, afflicted husband!&#xD;
I will never leave you, never cast you - oft', nevi~~ desert you. In sorrow&#xD;
and affliction, in woe and misery, I will ever be yours. Father and&#xD;
&#xD;
TII~ TRIALS OF M.~RY MAVERICK.&#xD;
mother may spurn you, the whole world may scoff at you, my poor&#xD;
husband, but Mary kill be your comforter. Even the wild delusions o~&#xD;
Mormonisin, that have so cruelly destroyed your reason, and made&#xD;
shipwreck of our happiness, shall not separate us. Like Ruth of old,&#xD;
"whither thou goest~I will go, and your God shall be my God." Should&#xD;
reason never again return to you, and I fear it nevei' will, your head&#xD;
shall still be pillowed upon the bosom of your own true Mary, .e.ven more&#xD;
fondly than in the days of our early love."&#xD;
While Mary was uttering these words, and for some minutes after,&#xD;
the maniac gazed so intently upon the face of his wife, that her heart&#xD;
thrilled with the hope that lie at length knew her and comprehended&#xD;
what she had uttered. But her hopes were deceived. No lucid interval&#xD;
had yet dawned upon that disordered mind. On the contrary, his frenzy&#xD;
soon became still more wild and terrific. In the new mood of his d&amp;amp;li-&#xD;
rium, he imagined that he stood, with the assembled universe, before&#xD;
the Judge of quick and dead, to hear his final doom. He had bar-&#xD;
tered the salvation of his soul, merely to please his wife and parents.&#xD;
The throng of glorified spirits who had triumphantly perished at the&#xD;
stake, or been torn in pieces by wild beasts, joyfully embracing martyr-&#xD;
dom-all these, as they heard his story, turned upon him a look of&#xD;
withering scorn, and cried "fool! .fool /" As the demons, at the conE-&#xD;
mand of his Judge, hurled him, shrieking, into the fathon~less abyss,&#xD;
myriads of infernalshapes howled at him till every cavern of the gloomy&#xD;
vault echoed back the cry, "fool I fool I fool !',&#xD;
He raved thus till near dawn, then gradually sunk into a caluX and&#xD;
tranquil sleep that lasted many hQurs. Dr. Horton frequently went to&#xD;
his bed-side, during this interval, and anxiously examined the pulse of&#xD;
the patient, for this he believed to be the crisis of his disorder, from&#xD;
which he would rapidly recover, or immediately sink into the grave.&#xD;
There was another fear that haunted the mind of the doctor, which he&#xD;
dared not breathe to others-thc fear tuat his patient would become a&#xD;
confirmed maniac.                       -  -&#xD;
It was near the middle of the afternoon when the sick man awoke.&#xD;
None were in the room but the parents and wife of the patient, and Dr.&#xD;
Horton. He opened his eyes and gazed for a few moments npon the&#xD;
group at his bed-side, and inquired if he had been very sicl~., Thenr&#xD;
was sanity of mind in that look, and every heart in the - room, beat with&#xD;
joy and thankfulness. Other questions from the sick man followed, ali&#xD;
of which manifested a return of reason.&#xD;
.In a short time, at a sign given by Mary, all departed.frQmn the room,&#xD;

We shall pass over the incid~ts of the journey to. 'gie ~Morniom Zi-&#xD;
on, and e~n omit the occurrence~ of the next two years after their ar~&#xD;
rival. Yet these two year~ were marked with signal events to the 'Moi~-&#xD;
inons. Great nutabers of th~ ~Latter-Day Saints had gather~e4t~wr~.&#xD;
from the various States of the great American-Republic, and some from&#xD;
nearly every Kingdom of Europe.&#xD;
With the untiring industry which that sect has manifested at every&#xD;
place they have yet occupied, this wild frontier wilderness had been&#xD;
converted into fruitful fields. Smiling cottages had sprung up on ev~&#xD;
cry side, as if by magic. Each family had its own allotment of~ ground~&#xD;
and peace and plenty shed their hallowed influence around this commu~~&#xD;
nity. The surplus products of their labor were e~~hanged with their&#xD;
merchants and mechanics for such articles as they needed, while their.&#xD;
printing press gave them weekly intelligence of the far-off land which&#xD;
they had left; besides supplying them with books that taught ~thern the'&#xD;
laws and doctrines of their sect, with the revelations of :their rrophet.&#xD;
Missionaries had been sent out, two and two, even into regions beyond.&#xD;
the Atlantic,. and hardly~a place diii they yisit, whirl faled 'of adding&#xD;
new converts to iVEormonism.&#xD;
Bitt even here, where the Latter-Da~y Saints had come under asol-&#xD;
enin pledge that they should not be molested-~-eveivhere they found&#xD;
no~ abiding place. It was resolved to drive them from the region which&#xD;
their' own labor had rendered valuable, or exterminate the whole sect.&#xD;
Td' justify this meditated outrage upon the rights of native born&#xD;
Atrrerican citizens, the wildest tales were put in circulation against&#xD;
that'pe~ple. They were described as thieves and~ assassins~ Men of&#xD;
bad character, who had been expelled by the lVtormons, gratified their&#xD;
revenge by publishing. infamous reports. Strange. as it may seem, one&#xD;
of the most. 'effective means employed to inflame the public mind to the&#xD;

libel upon our republican government, and is unworth'~r of the nipzie of&#xD;
an American citizen. ~Fo Aeclare that under a republican government&#xD;
there is no power to punish robbery and murder-none to protect the&#xD;
innocent-is equivalent to saying that such a government as ours ir&#xD;
utterly worthless. This is acknowledging the truth of the charges&#xD;
which the despots of Europe bring against our free institutions.&#xD;
Nothing can be more' false than the assertion, that the Mormons, of&#xD;
any other class of men, cannot be tried, and if guilty, punished. Every&#xD;
Ameriran, not profoundly, ignorant, knows that when there is any fear&#xD;
that men suspected of crimes cannot receive justice in the county in&#xD;
which they reside, the laws themselves provide that these men shall be&#xD;
removed, for trial; tQ some county where no such feat- ~xis~s. Will any&#xD;
base slanderer of bur free institutions have the impixd~nce to assert, that&#xD;
the people of Missouri and Illinois were so utterly corrupt and debased,&#xD;
that a single county could not be found in those two States, where the&#xD;
people were sufficiently honest to punish a Mormon, or any other crim~&#xD;
inal, if found guilty? The authors of these bloody outrages believed no&#xD;
such thing, for when Joe Smith, the Prophet and founder of that sect,&#xD;
voluntarily surrendered hiniself for trial in ~ county where he and the&#xD;
.Morrnons 'had not a single friend, did they try hinA 'No! lie was&#xD;
basely, cowardl~i murdered in prison.&#xD;
It is often asked why it is that respectable citizens applaud these&#xD;
outrages, and other specimens 9f American Lynch Law, if these deeds&#xD;
of violence and blood are not justifiable. - The answer is. obvious.&#xD;
For, 'the very same reason that respectable men in' France applauded Ro-&#xD;
bespierre and Marat, when in their hearts they loathed these monsters&#xD;
-a want of moral courage.&#xD;
But we will return to the narrative of passing events, from which a&#xD;
desire to vindicate the republican institutions of our country from slander&#xD;
and abuse has drawn us.&#xD;
Some dissensions had arisen among the Mormons themselves, and&#xD;
several families were on the point of abandoning the society, when in-&#xD;
telligence came to Zion, that a large band of armed men was approach.&#xD;
ing that town, to extermipate, themq In an instant every 'dissension&#xD;
was hushed, and'those who, but a moment before, were at deadly feud&#xD;
with their brethren threw themselves upon their knees at the feet of&#xD;
those they had wronged, and with tears implored their forgivenesss.&#xD;
Thero is nothing better calculated to unite people together, than the ex.&#xD;
pectatioh df ~ouring out their blood as ~nartyrs in the same cause.&#xD;

overwhelming force. We are net writing the history of the Mormons,&#xD;
and ~shall give no details of that affair, except what belongs immedi-&#xD;
ately to the Mavericks.&#xD;
Mary, in the midst of the furious assault, continued to hide little&#xD;
Eddy behind the forge of a blacksmith shop that stood next door to&#xD;
their dwelling. Eddy, who had grown to be a boy of unusual intelli-&#xD;
gence and manliness of character for a child of his age, begged hard&#xD;
to be permitted to stand by the side of his mother, and share her fate,&#xD;
but this the anxious parents refused. Hardly had the boy been securely&#xD;
I)laced in that covert, when his father's dwelling was fiercely ass~iiled,&#xD;
and Maverick, pierced with no less than four rifle balls, fell across his-&#xD;
own door sill. Mary had just raised the head of the dying man in&#xD;
her lap; anl heard his last sigh, when a cry of exultation rose from the&#xD;
adjoining blacksmith shop. Eddy had been discovered, and was drag-&#xD;
ged forth by a young man, whose real name we shall conceal under&#xD;
that of Vorne. Mary, with all the energy of her soul, implored them to&#xD;
spare her child, her only child, all that was now left to her widowed&#xD;
heart, pointing to her husband, who lay dead at her feet, in a pooi of&#xD;
blood. But Eddy, even in this fearful hour, disdaining all supplications&#xD;
for his life, proudly drew up his form to its utmost height, and said,. "I&#xD;
am. an ./lmerican!" Poor, mistaken, deluded child-he had read the&#xD;
history of his country, and vainly supposed that the very name of&#xD;
"./Jmerican" would throw around his- rights a shield of adamant. But&#xD;
the proud claim of the boy, and the wild pleadings of the young mother,&#xD;
were alike disregarded. Vorne replied, with a coarse, fiendish laugh,&#xD;
"kill the young wolves, and there will be no o'ld ones!" Saying this,&#xD;
he coolly and deliberately brought his rifle within a foot of the child's&#xD;
head, and blew out his brains, sprinkling the clothes of the mother with&#xD;
the blood of her own child.&#xD;
Let no one suppose, even for an instant, that the sceiie just described&#xD;
is a fiction. For the honor of manhood, we do niost devoutly wish it&#xD;
were~ IBut we assure the reader that every incident related, however&#xD;
i~evohing, is strictly true. The slaughter of the father, the concealment&#xD;
and discovery of the boy, his proud claim, "I am am .,~mericam"-th6&#xD;
reply of Vorne, and the blowing out of the child's brains before the eyes&#xD;
of the agonized mother, all occurred just as it is here related. No hu-&#xD;
man consideration would have tempted the writer to fabricate a fiction so&#xD;
revolting. But it is truth, and should be told.&#xD;

tions of his native land.&#xD;
We shall likewise pass over the tearless ag~ny of Mary Maverick, who&#xD;
threw herself upon the dead bodies of her husband and child, and iq~-&#xD;
plored them in mercy to kill her also. Nor will we pause to describe&#xD;
her flight from *er burning home, snatching only from thence a small&#xD;
bundle, containing a few articles rendered holy to her by the remem-&#xD;
brance of little Eddy and her husband.&#xD;
For an hour, the widowed, childless Mormoness fled into the wild&#xD;
forest, nearly bereft of reason. Overcome with fatigue, she sat down&#xD;
~t the mouth of one of he low, narrow caves ~o common in that upland&#xD;
region. Resting her weary limbs for a few moments, she tried to collect&#xD;
her thoughts, and inquiry~ what were the claims of duty; even in that fear-&#xD;
ful emergency Concealing her bundle as far as possible in that cave,&#xD;
with the intention of saving from the profane hands of strangers that&#xD;
which had been dear to her child, she departed, she knew not ~vhither.&#xD;
Women and children equally forlorn were fleeing n every direction, with&#xD;
no aim but that of escaping, as fast as possible, from their assailants.&#xD;
Mary soon joined a band of these fugitives, and sought to forget her&#xD;
own sorrows in her efforts to console those whose afflictions were heavier&#xD;
than her own. Destitute of food and shelter, they dared not solicit&#xD;
either in the vicinity of their late residence, and these helpless outcasts&#xD;
endured untold sufl~rings. But, as they proceeded farther from the&#xD;
scene of their disasters, on their way to the Mississippi River, they&#xD;
found that compassion had not yet forsaken the human heart. The&#xD;
sympathies of the better class of the people of Missouri were powerfully&#xD;
excited, and the doors of every respectable house on their route were&#xD;
thrown wide open to the sufferers. Their wants were supplied with a&#xD;
liberal hand, and no kind efforts spared to ~soothe their afflictions~&#xD;
Though the public voip~. may actionn the outrages of "Lynch Law,"&#xD;
yet every really honest. ma~ e~eora1~s, in tie ~ecret recesses of his own&#xD;
heart, the lawless deeds that b~irig down reproach upon our free institu-&#xD;
tions~ inforeign lands. ~ was emphatically the case in the present&#xD;
instance, and s~ympath~zing friends of the Mormons, as there~would have&#xD;
done for any other sufl'erers, sprung up on every side. T1~e most re-&#xD;
spectable people in Illinois took the lead in this xnanifestati6sytnpathy,&#xD;
and invited these homeless outcasts~ to settle i~ that State, on the bank of&#xD;
the Mississippi, not far from the town of War~aw: ~PJ48 ~;is l'e foun-&#xD;

Mrs. Maverick was everywhere received with the utmost kindness.&#xD;
~he tittered no coxhplaint~, atid 'never spoke either of her own wrongs&#xD;
and sufferings, or those of the Mormons, ~rhen she 'could well avoid it.&#xD;
She made no allusion, however distant, to her cruel bereavement of hus-&#xD;
band and child, mit attempted ~o appear calm, and even cheerful, that&#xD;
she might hide from the world the sorrows which none could assuage .&#xD;
Yet a single glance at her pale, subdued countenance, told every obser.'&#xD;
ver that the iron had entered deep into her heart. There wa~ a 1o~k of'&#xD;
uncomplaining sorrow, mingled with the unfailing gentleness of her&#xD;
tones and manner, that touched the. beholder. No one could see her,&#xD;
ev~n in a crowc~ without feeling a singular attractionn toward the pale&#xD;
stranger. A young merchant of considerable 'wealth, and of high stand-&#xD;
ing in community, at whose mother's house the young~ Mormoness found&#xD;
a shelter in the hour of her greatest need, felt that~ attraction irresistible.&#xD;
lie offered to the homeless widow his hand and fortune, with the assu-&#xD;
rance that her rdigious opinions should ever be sacredly respected. This&#xD;
generous offer the Mormoness declined with profound humility, but&#xD;
decidedly, much as she esteemed him for his many virtues. All the&#xD;
promise that he could extort from' her 'was, that she would accept from&#xD;
him any pecuniary aid that she might at any time find needful.&#xD;
The Mormoness, feeling the impropriety of remaining any longer un-&#xD;
der th~ roof of her kind benefactress, after this declaration of her son,&#xD;
was compelled, once 'more, to go out into the world, and seek a new&#xD;
home. With the Latter-Day Saints she knew that she would ~e~eive a&#xD;
cordial welcome, but they had lost their all, and found iLdifficult to&#xD;
provide even for their own wants. She resolved, therefore, to return; ds&#xD;
soon as possible, 'to the settlement ~f Sixteen Mile Prairie, and seek&#xD;
a home in the family of Judge Maverick, her father-in-law. ' Her&#xD;
thoughts had often turned toward them, and she knew full well that un-&#xD;
der their roof she would receive a heart-felt iec~ption, as a 'daughter&#xD;
dear to their hearts. ilut she had long hesitated' to return thither, fear-&#xD;
ing 'that ~he remembrance of other days, of herhusband' and child, 'would&#xD;
awaken, in that place, sorrows beyond evem~ her power of endurance.&#xD;
l3tit 'her heart had now been disciplined in the school of suffering ~nd&#xD;

all th~ fervor of nature, This band belonged to t~ie half'eivilized tribe&#xD;

O~iheirarrivaLat the Shawnee village, Mary tookip~ber residence&#xD;
~Qr a time, ~n the Wissxo~ family. The Jndi~ns~ ~ttne W~ thei~ ~1:pn~se,&#xD;
set theziselyes earnestly at WO11~ to build her a ~ho W5~ net&#xD;
a little, surprised to find ths~t it bid fair tob~ far the hest in ~ l~e~&#xD;
ThQ agent procure such 'material~ and workmen as the'Th~ans'couid&#xD;
not well provide. - The house was large, for it was designed ~y-Xtf&#xD;
for a school, as ~vell as for hei pirate residence&#xD;
In a short time the Indians becajije warmly attached to Mrs. l~&amp;amp;rer-&#xD;
ick, who was constantly among th~m; wherever an oppo~tun~tj ~f' d~ing&#xD;
good presented. A few weeks of earneSt' ~pphcatnon had e~aWed her&#xD;
to speak their language fluently, on all ordinary subjects a~&amp;amp; 'is ~4ded&#xD;
much to her influence. With the girls who ~tt~nded c~i9~Jit was&#xD;
a ~vonk of love to learh. Their d6rk fac~s bearne~Vw ~6nfIdence and'&#xD;
affection, I ~vhenever hey were turned toward their t~ch~er,~und she was&#xD;
known in tkn village by the Indian name which they ~f~ied ~on her,&#xD;
and which was one of the most affectionate terms in tli6 whole compass&#xD;
of the Shawnee language. Every wish of hers w~s obeyed by these&#xD;
girls, and, unconsciously to themsdves, they imitated her in everything,&#xD;
even in her gestures, and the tone of ~er Voice. She sdught to inspire&#xD;
-them with a love for the Irue and the bc2zutiful, as one -of the most&#xD;
effi~ctive means of improving their minds. '~he adorned the 'yard. of the&#xD;
school house with the shrubs and flowers that grew w, id in that region~&#xD;
and it was deemed a sufficient reward to the most diligent and meritori-&#xD;
Gus scholar, to be permitted to assist her i~ these recreations.' The. im~&#xD;
proveme!it of these Indian girls soon became visible in the netttness and&#xD;
taste seen in their own homes.&#xD;
'But even there, where the Mormoness devoted herself to th~ slng~&#xD;
pui~~ose of doing good to others, without a selfish thotight enteringlier&#xD;
heart, - she was not doomed tO escape ew.ry and detraction.' -Some&#xD;
whites oppose every attempt to instruct the 1ndians~ because they deem&#xD;
it injurious to their own traffic. Even the family of the kind-hearted. -&#xD;
pious missionary remembered that rshe was a Morgioness, and notall her&#xD;
deeds of 'charity and love, could induce them to look upon her with etitir.&#xD;
cordiality. JI~eports, false and g~ound1ess, began to be whispered-among&#xD;
the Indians, and a few withdraw their daughters 'from the school. All&#xD;
this' she met in silence, for she' neither sought nor e~pe~ted ha~ppiiiem&#xD;
from' any other sourc~j than the consciousness of having faithMly dis-&#xD;
charged her duty,, and no power upon earth could divest her~of that.&#xD;

died iii ~. ~evLr 'hours after the attack, afid consternation wirs universal.&#xD;
AI~ who were able fled' from the unseen foe, to seek protection amoiig&#xD;
tiriy~ bf i~h~ 4i~tant tribes that would receive them. Whole families per-&#xD;
i~h~d in ~i$i' flight, and the unburied remains of the victims ~f that&#xD;
terriWe s~o~frge lay scatteredd over the plains. A party of near fifty, in-&#xD;
c1udirt~ men, w&amp;amp;men and children, fled to the Shawnees, who compelled&#xD;
them to ericatrip oX 'the distance of two miles from their village. It&#xD;
was invain that thes savages had 'fled'from the pestilence. Fatigue&#xD;
and 'terror predisposed them to the cholera, which broke out among them&#xD;
on their arrival, with redoubled violence. None of the Shawnees would&#xD;
visit their' encampnrenb and none of the afflicted tribe were permitted to&#xD;
approach thevillage.     human appearance, the whole encampment&#xD;
~was doozne4.. hi this emergency, the young Mormoness resolved to fly&#xD;
to die as~istarrce of these friendless savages. No persuasion could shake&#xD;
her resolution. ProcuriAg from the agent the few medicines prescribed&#xD;
for the cholera, she took a large bundle containing such articles as she&#xD;
'would most need, and comitiendirig herself to the protection of heaven,&#xD;
she carefully closed the doors and windows of her house, which' she&#xD;
might never again enter, and then departed for the encampment of the&#xD;
savages. 'On her way,, she met the wagon of the mission family, who&#xD;
were hastening toihe white settlements of Missouri. They paused long&#xD;
'enomfgh to reproach 'the heroic woman with "lempt'ng Providence," by&#xD;
rashly exposing her own life in such an enterprise. Unmoved by this&#xD;
detmnciation~steadfast 'in ~her purpose, she resolutely pursued her way.&#xD;
Death, in the frightful fo(~u o~ cholera, might await her, but, whether&#xD;
~1ife or death was to be her lots,' she f~lt that the path of duty was always&#xD;
the.'path of safety, and the olily Oae.,&#xD;
Great was the astonishment of these savages, when they saw a female&#xD;
ot beautiful form, apparently' twenty4oar or five years of age, in a snow&#xD;
white -attire~ ~mddenly appear' among them,'arid; in the Shawnee tongue,&#xD;
inform them that she caine to attend upon iheir sick. The smile with&#xD;
whichehe announced this unexpected' message, 'g&amp;amp;~e to'her pale counten-&#xD;

by * gesture of the hand, forbidden it. Joy and hope noW to 1 ~f&#xD;
the dark and sullen despair frito which they hail been puxi~e~ Tkk&#xD;
Mormoness went instantly to wtrk in aid of the sufferers~ The it~&#xD;
cheerfully obeyed bet orders. She had the sick removed ifl&#xD;
tent, where she could have them all under her eye at once.&#xD;
did they swallow the nauseating drugs that she administered, within a&#xD;
word ~ inquiry, and in full confidence of recovery, for they~~believ~d&#xD;
there was life in every medicine administered by her hand. Uultnly,&#xD;
and with a light, quick step, ~the young Mormoness moved among~the&#xD;
sick, giving medicine to one, v~iping the cold, clammy dew~ front 'fhe&#xD;
forehead of another, and holding to the fevered 'lips of a third the cooling&#xD;
draught6, To~ all she spoke words of hope and consolation, that cheered&#xD;
and comforted their responding hearts.&#xD;
In a few'days, the sick were all convalescent. None had died since~&#xD;
her arrival, except' those whom she had found in the' last stages of tht~t'&#xD;
fearful 'disorder. They now began' to be in want oP the neces~ri~ii ~?&#xD;
'ife, aiA the Shawnees still prohibiting all communication with the ~i1~&#xD;
lage, Mary dispatched a trusty ~messenger to her house in the night, to&#xD;
bring from thence her whole supply of provisions, which, hapPi~ for&#xD;
them, was not a small one.&#xD;
Ingratitude is not among the vices of savage Iif~. It is only ir~ t1~e&#xD;
society of the civilized and refined, that man repays the kludness of a,&#xD;
friend and benefactor with hatred. These Indians madb no loud and&#xD;
boisterous professions of thankfulne~ to t'he Mormoness, but gratitude.,&#xD;
deep land heartfelt, be~xned in every look 'they .gave her. O~ie. of her&#xD;
patients was a savage of powerful frame. regarded among them as the~&#xD;
bravest warrior of the tribe. ' None who recovered was so violently, at.&#xD;
tacked with the cholera as he. For some time jielay niotiouless, and ap.&#xD;
parently insensible, but,' though unable toniJve,~or 'artict4ate awoxd, he&#xD;
observed every movement of his kin&amp;amp; nurse, and s~w the untiring eft'orts&#xD;
she made in his behalf. '&#xD;
In the very first day that lie ~was able to leave 'the: tt~nt of' the sick,&#xD;
and return to his own, after a short a~itence he ~rrn~ ~ and stood&#xD;
directly before the Mormoriess. He held In his hand a la~e bundl~&#xD;
carefully enveloped in a neatly tainted fa~Wn's skjn, mid sai4~,,, hr his -&#xD;
broken English, "Pale-faced' squaw save ah4e~'yah's bfr~.4~4iye ikr -&#xD;

~udle~ of little- Ed~ly's play-tnings, which she h~ad hidden in the cave,&#xD;
when fleeing from her burning 'home. "Wali-/ie-yal&amp;amp; saw 'rale-face&#xD;
at cave." Saying this, the savage drew close to Mary~ and;in&#xD;
/    ~e he uttered, between his teeth~, a name that made the Mdr-&#xD;
~no~-start, and a livid paleness overspread her cotanlenance. -It was&#xD;
the name of Vorne, the murderer of her child-not the name we have&#xD;
gwezvl~i~, but his real name, With a look of revenge and hate gla-&#xD;
ring iti hi~ burning eyes,,  vbich seemed like those of the incarnate&#xD;

these i;mintelligitle exclamations, he left the tent.&#xD;
Mary wept long over her recovered treasures, novr the dearest object&#xD;
she had in existence, 'tar they once belonged to her child. They were&#xD;
he very play-things which she had s. often seen Lini play with, when&#xD;
he wasa careless, happy child, and she a happy ~vife and mother. They&#xD;
were all that was now left her of those happy days, and where is&#xD;
the b~reaved mother who will no(enter into her feelings, as she gazed&#xD;
upon these newly recovered relics? Yes! her husI and and child had&#xD;
gone to a bloody grave, without the form of ~ trial, and that, too, in a&#xD;
Republic that guarantees to evcry individual unlimited freedom of cor.~&#xD;
science, and a fair trial by jury-a Republic upon whose flag i'~ embla~&#xD;
zoned the Roman Eagle. Wherever the banner of Rhine played in&#xD;
the breeze, t/u'~e the meanest citizen found protection. Paul, the Apostle&#xD;
to. the Geatile'~ the preacher of a sect abhorred and accursed by the&#xD;
multitude, found instant protection under the wings of that eagle.&#xD;
When. he calmly, but proudly folded his arms upon his I reast, and said,&#xD;
"I am a Roman citizen," th~ haughty Satrap trembled on his throne, for&#xD;
well did he know, that if he dared violate the rights of the ILeanest,&#xD;
niost criminal of her citizens, Rome, in the language of one of hcr&#xD;
sons, "would hurl at his devoted head a lhunderloH." But does the&#xD;
Am~rican Eagle thus protect the rights of the free-torn citizens of our&#xD;
Repu~li~? A voice, from ra any a Mormon grave, from the Haze of&#xD;
unnuinb~red dwellings, end from the victims of Lynch Law in nu-&#xD;

rang Through the still air. Again and again, fbr the third 'time, that&#xD;

all was still. In the next moment, a horse with saddle and bridle, Wt&#xD;
no rider, rushed wildly by. Hastening in the direction from which the&#xD;
anmial.came,-they -discovered, at no great distance, a mail lying upon&#xD;

- vani~~r told him cenltl tiot but be highly gratifying to a widow as poor&#xD;
-ea she ~was, and aij Mormoriess besides.&#xD;
*       The door opened, and Mary's l4rother, who had met the man he. was&#xD;
going to~e, entered. The ~pell in which all her faculties seemed&#xD;
loun&amp;amp;was instantly dissolved, and drawing a deep sigh, like one just&#xD;
awakened from a hideous dream, she rushed from the room.&#xD;
The command, "Love your enemies, do goo4~ to -them -that persecute&#xD;
you," were no unmeaning words in the creed pf Mary Mayerick, -and&#xD;
she earnestly endeavored to fulfill the precept, and feel for her remorse-&#xD;
-less persecut~r5 the - spirit of -- Him whose dying prayer for his mur-&#xD;
derers wasj- ",Fcdher, forgive them." - -&#xD;
The trial of attending upon Vorne, which before, Mary, at times,&#xD;
found lii~rdly endurable, was rendered doubly irksome by this declaration.&#xD;
l3ut 0till, it was her duty to forgive, and render good for all the deadly&#xD;
wrong-he h~d done her. -&#xD;
She now carefully i~oided being in the presence of Vorne when her&#xD;
brother was absent, and thus afford I him no opportunity of renewing&#xD;
his revolting proposals. 1~ut she con. not always have the protecting&#xD;
presence of h~f brother, and about a eek after the scene just related&#xD;
had trarispiied, he found her alone, -a I again made the ofrer of mar-&#xD;
riage. She was now prepared for the vent, and preserved a command&#xD;
over her feelings. Without giving him any intimation of her acquaint-&#xD;
ar~ca with- any portion of hi~ previous history, she mildly declined his&#xD;
proposal, alledging no other season than her determination, -her mialter-&#xD;
able determination, never again~ under any possible ~viscwnatancea, to&#xD;
xnarrjr.--&#xD;
Greatly was he disappointed, for he had entertaine4 not a doubt of her&#xD;
willingness-to exchange poverty for comparative affluence. He com-&#xD;
bated her ie*~ltitiori with every nrgnxnent that he thought might have&#xD;

the idea ati~tz%~Ic hiudhat her objections arose fror~i that source, and he&#xD;

prevented her from uttering.             -          -  -    - -&#xD;

not attempt to avenge her wrongs, - she infonne4 - him that Vorn~wa~ -&#xD;
the murdererr of her child, and acquainted him with his proposal of mar-~ *&#xD;

We will not de~,ribe the emotions of- the brother. It was enough j&#xD;
that he had Sworn Aot to avenge his sister, and the murderer should be&#xD;
left for ~punishment to the- tribunal of- Heaven. - -&#xD;
The wounds of Vorne were rapidly healing, and in a week more, if&#xD;
no unfavorable symptoms should arise, he wouldbe able to remove front&#xD;
there with perfect safety. - -&#xD;
It was settled between the brother and sister that their patient should&#xD;
depart on the day appointed by himself for his final answer&#xD;

from the house aflbrded the latter an opportunity most ardently desired,&#xD;
of conversing with the wido alone.&#xD;
After a paus~ of a few minutes, during which the lVtormoues3 could&#xD;
almost hear the beating of her own heart, Vorne introduced the sub-&#xD;
ject ever present to his thoughts. He told his Jove, and told it in burn-&#xD;
ing words. That he felt for the widow all the deep and absorbing emo-&#xD;
tions of which his wild, impassioned nature was capable of feeling,&#xD;
was no factions~ Her gentleness of soul, so unlike his own, her soft,&#xD;
pensive, melancholy air, and her unceasing kindness to him during the&#xD;
long days and nights when his life hung by a thread, had awakened in&#xD;
his turbulent, impassioned bosom an affection for the Mormoness, which&#xD;
he felt would be the ruling passion of his soul to the last hourof his&#xD;
existence.&#xD;
To this ardent profession, the Mormoness calmly, but firmly gave a&#xD;
repulse. Not even yet believing her decision unalterable~ he spoke of&#xD;
her unprotected condition after her brother should depart, and of the&#xD;
wealth he had acquired by trade. As he proceeded, his voice rose wit1~&#xD;
the increasing excitement of his mind. He at length averted to her&#xD;
connection with the Mormons, and his generosity in proposing to unite&#xD;
himself with one who belonged to a denomination so unpopular, so&#xD;
horrid by the public. He would take her to a far distant State, where&#xD;
her former connection with them would be forever unknown.&#xD;
In the excitement of his feeli~igs, he had unwittingly confessed his&#xD;
deadly hatred to a sect which he had proposed to join, and, 'unkrzowii&#xD;
to himself, touched a cord that vibrated to the profoundest depths of her&#xD;
heart, and.brought before her mind's eye, in all the vivid Jn~ies of truth,&#xD;
the fatal scene when her agonizing prayer for the life of her child was&#xD;
received with a fiendish scoff.&#xD;
Even then, anxious to spare the murderer pain, she toLd him again that&#xD;
her resolution was unalterable, and begged him to depart in peace.&#xD;
Not satisfied with this, he still sought to shake her resolution. It was&#xD;
not till then that the Mormoness, finding other means of no avail, told&#xD;
him that there was an obstacle to her union with him-a barrier be-&#xD;
tween them, wide and impassable as the gulf of fire that separated the&#xD;
rii4 man in the Gospel from the bosom of Abraham-and again most&#xD;
eaz'uestly implored and entreated him to depart in peace, without making&#xD;
~iir~er solicitations or inquiries.&#xD;
~ storm of passion arose in the bosom of Vorne, and broke forth&#xD;
wildly and fearfully as the hurricane of the tropics; and he demanded.&#xD;

-force, and, in his attempt to seize her ~rmn, oversee the lamp and extin-&#xD;
guished the light. In an instant, a sight met the view of Vorzie, which&#xD;
rivited him to the spot, as if he were transformed into a marble statue~&#xD;
and his eye-balls glared with intense horror. On the opposite wall of&#xD;
the room, directly before him, he saw the Zion o~the Mormons. It was&#xD;
noon-day. An armed mob, most of whom he instantly knew by name,&#xD;
rushed along the principal street. Across the door-sill of a cottage lay a ~&#xD;
man, weltering in blood. The scene changed. A youth, hardly twenty-&#xD;
one years of age, in whom Vorne recognized himself, was dragging a&#xD;
lad of noble bearing before the door where lay the dying man, the child's&#xD;
father.t A. lovel female who stood by the side of the bloody corpse,&#xD;
appeared to&#xD;
in agony for the life of the child. He now knew her&#xD;
an a sister's It was the woman who had watched over him with&#xD;
care-the woman to whom he owed his life.. He&#xD;
young man spurn the imploring agony of that mother, and de-&#xD;
liberately blow out the brains of her child. Every scene was so true&#xD;
life-like, it seemed to Vorne a living reality.&#xD;
All was now explained. Everything was now clear to him as noon-&#xD;
* It~ was her ~chiId that he had murdered, ~'without imagining that&#xD;
killii~g a Mor on would ever rise up against him. He it was who had&#xD;
&amp;amp; t....*i'~&#xD;
wantonl~r oerer~tn~t woman of heA~ last hold upon life. And knowing&#xD;
t and bearrig the wound evei~ mo t in her bosom, she had&#xD;
devoted days and nights to his' recovery. All thisj past through hi'&#xD;
~id/witli the swiftness of a flash of lightningg, and [writhing with an-&#xD;
guish of soul which few beings on earth are capable of feeling, he ex*&#xD;
claidied, "0, 1am accursed GQd and man-.--my punishment is grea-&#xD;
terlkanlcanbear!"&#xD;
The brother of the Mormoness came into the roon~i ~with a.light, arid&#xD;
led his almost inanimate sister to her own apartment, and instantly re-&#xD;
turned. Stepping to the outer door, he called into th~ house of anIndi-&#xD;
an, who stood withotit~holding Vorne's horse, which Wa~ e nipped for a&#xD;
journey. then addressing himself to the latter, h~ said, o , your&#xD;
horse is at the door-all your things are deposited in your&#xD;
this man will conduct you to a house, which is not far distan&#xD;

and before the sun had risen above the long line of forest which bounds&#xD;
the distant landscape on the east of Shawneetown, he had left that vU-&#xD;

The exciting events of the past night had not been unfelt by the Mor-&#xD;
moness. The death of her husband an4 child, with the sorrows through&#xD;
which she had passed, were all presented before him, and she felt as if&#xD;
she had been wading through that troubled sea for the second time.-.--.&#xD;
Her long confinement at the bedside of the wounded man had already&#xD;

were painted by herself, long after the occurrence of the event&#xD;
portrayed, and were true to the life. Every feature of those scen~swaa&#xD;
too deeply traced upon her heart ever toThe obliterated.&#xD;
In the morning a fever was preying upon the life-blood of the Mo&#xD;
inoness. In a few days it left her, for the fuel that sustaineUts res&#xD;
was consumed, and a languor, the unfailing harbinger of app)~oa&amp;amp;hing~&#xD;
dissolution, pressed with lea n weight upon her he~r~. She ~elt that&#xD;

might do good to others, confidently trust g that the afflictions through&#xD;
which she might be called to pass, 4ike a fiery furnace, would purify her&#xD;

of earth, and stood on the  fines o~4e~Pirit lrtnd.&#xD;
For many minutes she lay motionless, her eyes closed. The  e at&#xD;
her wrist had ceased, and not the slightest breath stirred the light doWn&#xD;
of the feather held before her pale lips. All thought her spirit had de.&#xD;
parted. Suddenly she opened her eyes, and gazing upward, her anna&#xD;
extended as if to clasp some object dearest to her heart, she exclaimed,&#xD;
in tones of rapture, "Husband! Eddy! I come ! Receive me again         I&#xD;
to your bosoms, my husband and child! I come! I come!" Uttering&#xD;
these words, the lone sufferer was at rest,.and, w~ trust, received a crew~&#xD;
of rejoicing from j~im whose command is, "Love your enemies!"&#xD;
Three weeks after his departure from the Shawnee. village, Vorne&#xD;
discovered in the vicinity of St. Louis, wandering about like on~&#xD;
i~u~w~uuera~, or who has lost his way. A relative of his took charge&#xD;
aM ~his effects. In a sl~ort time it was round necessary to cha±i~&#xD;
o prevent him from committing suicide, which he had twice attempt.&#xD;
any days and nights he sat sullen, muttering wildly and~ 4&#xD;
and to himself about the Mormoness, after which a change came&#xD;
5          mind, and he raved and howled in the most fearful&#xD;
his friends were compelled to consign him to a mad-house.&#xD;
There he yet remains. The physicians who have attended upon him&#xD;
ye not the slightest hopes of his recovery. Wild raving, hopeless re-&#xD;
~he vultures of Prometheus, are ever knowing at his heart.&#xD;
of the boy, and the agonized supplication of the mother, are&#xD;
to his mind. Nor has even insanity torn from his mind a&#xD;
t of kindness which the afflicted Woman had bestowed upon him&#xD;
who had b~ti~ved her. He remembers it all-his own crimes, and her&#xD;
heaven-born charity in returning good for evil-and he will remember it&#xD;
forever. When he has passed the confines that divide earth from the&#xD;
spirit land, the memory of his crimes will survive fresh, and green for-&#xD;
ever.&#xD;
