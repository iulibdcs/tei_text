            <p>SKOLARS, and men wich wuzn't skolars, hev deprekated the manufakter uv so many books.
               Whether they were justified or not in their strikters, it doesn't become me to say.
               Probably they wood say to me, ef I should consult em (wich I shel not), "Don't
               publish this book; there's reely no okkashun for it!" There isn't? Did the capchus
               adviser see the state uv my pants? Did he observe the wreckt condishun of my boots?
               Is he aware that I am in arrears for board? Not publish my book! Kin I so far forget
               my dooty to humanity? Nary. Its publikashen will at least do ONE suffrin man good,
               and that's more than half uv the writers kin say. What recks it that that<pb n="8-9"
                  xml:id="VAC7103-00000005"/> one is ME? Wat posterity will say I don't know;
               neither do I care. I ain't labrin for posterity; neither did my father, else I hed
               bin better off. Posterity may assign me a niche in the temple uv massive intellex, or
               may not; it's all one to the subscriber. I woodn't give a ten-cent postal currency
               for wat the next generashen will do for me. It's this generashen I'm goin for. So
               much for Buckinham!</p>
            <p>When I last communed with my readers, Democrisy wuz about the most bustid
               institooshen in this country. Dimocrisy hed undertook to carry the President, and it
               broke down under the load. Then the President undertook to carry the Dimocrisy, and
               he broke down under that load. Both were sootable to be carried, but neither hed the
               strength to carry the tother. And so, doorin the winter, spring, and summer they lay,
               both at the bottom uv the ditch uv despondency, lookin helplessly at each other, but
               neither able to help his fellow-suffrer. They wood hev embraced, but they hedn't
               strength enuff to roll together.</p>
            <p>The Fall elections revived us. The Ablishnists lishnists uv Maine didn't vote, wich
               give our people in Californy strength; the carryin uv that State discouraged em in
               Ohio and Pennsylvany, wich, follered up, give us the overwhelmin triumph in Noo York.
               That give us life; that infused vigger into us. It operatid like a invigorator—a
               stiff wun—does onto the bowels uv a Kentuckian whose flask is out, and who hezn't bin
               neer a bar-room for thirty-six hours. It wuz strengthenin.</p>
            <p>These confliks may be considered the skirmishin percedin the main battle. We hev druv
               in their outposts; shel we be ez successful when we storm their works? Upon the anser
               to that conundrum depends much. Ef we do, then shel the Post Offis wich I now hold be
               mine four years longer; then shel I still enjoy the conjenial society uv them wich
               long assosiashen with hez made deer; then for four years will my sustenance be
               ashoored. That will do me. I probably wont eggsist longer. Within that time my
               venerable biler, now weakened in spots, will hev bustid, and I shel hev gone to join
               Elder Gavitt, wherever he may be.</p>
            <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7103-00000006"/>
            <p>We kin conker, however, and we must. We hev the Ablishnists onto the hip. They
               endorst the nigger in 1863 and $4, and the people stood it becoz they needed him. It
               didn't become the city, wich hed filled its quota with nigger troops, to go back on
               the Ethiopian. Neither did it look well for the Ablishnist, who praised em for ther
               devoshun at Petersburg, etcetra, to deny that they wuz a man and a brother. BUT NOW
               THE NIGGER AIN'T NEEDED. Grim war hez smoothed his wrinkled front, and we are caprin
               gayly in my lady's chamber to the lascivious soundins uv the loot. Now, the servis
               the nigger rendered us fades out uv our remembrance, wich it does faster than his
               color did in strikly Democratic States under the old arrangement. They don't want him
               any more; and, glory! he's the same d—d nigger he alluz wuz. So duz the wholesome
               prejudis agin color swallow up gratitood! So does the pride uv race smother wat the
               thin-skind uv the Radikels call justis!</p>
            <p>It is onto this string we must harp. The Democrisy hev alluz conkered when they went
               calmly on—secoor in the beleef that all mankind wuz either ninnies or raskels. They
               ain't fur out uv the way. The nigger is now onfit for citizenship—let it be our dooty
               to see that he continues onfit. Shood he rise to an intellektooal level with us, we
               are out uv an argument agin. The law agin schoolin uv em must be enforced; the laws
               regulatin their labor must be made ez stringent ez ever; for ef they are allowed to
               go unregulated, the Ablishnists will say to-wunst that sich ain't nessary. We must
               keep a worritin, and pokin, and punchin this lion, that his roarin may show the
               necessity uv our bein kep in power to restrain him.</p>
            <p>I bleeve in commencin early. Let outrages by niggers be commenst to-wunst. Let
               niggers be found dead uv starvashen ez soon ez possible. Let the shuddrin uv
               Democratic damsels over the horrors uv bein forst to contract matermonyel alliances
               with niggers be got up immejitly, and let ther shudders be strong. Let the heresy uv
               the Noo York World, that niggers don't stink, be refooted by a body uv<pb n="12-13"
                  xml:id="VAC7103-00000007"/> Dimekratic ethnologists, who shel assert that they do,
               and make oath to it; and, in short, let all the old machinery, wich served us so well
               in days gone by, be set in moshen agin, and all will be well with us.</p>
            <p>Then shel we conker. Then shel we regain that wich we lost in 1860, and in the haven
               uv success, feedin fat onto the manna uv public patronage, enjoy for a time the
               felicity of livin under Dimekratic laws, made by Dimekrats, and executed by
               Dimekrats.</p>

               <p>I NEVER wuz so elevated, nor never so cast down, in my life, ez last nite, and the
                  entire Corners wuz ditto. The circumstances uv the case wuz ez follows. Me and a
                  party uv friends wuz a playin draw poker with a Noo York commershel travler, I
                  believe they call em, a feller with a mustash and side whiskers, wich comes South
                  a talkin secesh and a sellin goods. He made some inquiries about the standin uv
                  the deelers at the Corners, and wuz, arter sed inquiries, eggstreemly anxious to
                  sell em goods, for cash. They wanted em on ninety<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000008"/> days' time, and on this they split. He agreed with
                  em in principle—he drank to Jeff Davis, and damned Linkin flooently—but on the
                  cash question he wuz inflexible and unmovable. To while away the rosy hours, a
                  knot of choice sperits, him inclooded, gathered in the Post Orifis, to enjoy a
                  game uv draw poker. There wuz me and Square Gavitt, and Deekin Pogram, and Elder
                  Slathers, and the Noo York drummer. We played till past the witchin hour of 12 M.,
                  when graveyards yawn and gosts troop forth—when the Noo Yorker suckumd. His
                  innocent, unseasoned bowels hedn't bin eddicated up to the standard uv Kentucky
                  whiskey, wich, new ez we drink it, is pizen to foreigners. The Deekin and Elder
                  grabbed the stakes wich wuz onto the table, and rifled his pockets on the
                  suspishen that he wuz a Ablishinist, and rolled him out, and while in the very
                  act, Pollock, the Illinoy storekeeper, cum rushin in, askin us ef we'd heerd the
                  news.</p>
               <p>We ansered yoonanimusly that we hedn't.</p>
               <p>"I'm jist in from Looisville," sed he; "I jist rode over from the stashen.
                  Looisville is in a blaze uv glory!"</p>
               <p>"Wat," sez I, "hez Sumner killed Thad Stevens and immejitly committed
                  sooicide?"</p>
               <p>"Nary," sez he, "but Johnson and Congress hev come together on the basis uv
                  yooniversal Amnesty, wich wuz proclaimed yesterday, to be follered by yooniversal
                  suffrage ez soon ez the South kin conveniently do it. They hev met and embraced on
                  Horris Greely's plan."</p>
               <p>Deekin Pogram bust into a hysterical laff, and in his joy handed me the proceeds
                  uv his explorashen uv the pockets uv the Noo Yorker, and like a blessed old
                  lunatic broke for the meetin-house. In a moment or two the bell pealed forth its
                  joyous notes, and in a minit more the half-dressed villagers wuz seen emergin from
                  their respective domiciles in all stiles uv attire. A few minits sufficed to make
                  them understand wat wuz the occasion uv the uproar, and a more enthoosiastic
                  population never woke the ekkoes. Afore five minutes hed rolled off into eternity,
                  ther wuz a bonfire blazin on the North side uv the square, the sed bonfire bein a
                  nigger skool-house wich the Freedmen's Commishn hed erected, and wich our
                  enthoosiastic citizens hed in their delirium uv joy set fire to. It was
                  emblematic. The smoke ez it rolled to the South methawt assoomed the shape uv a
                  olive branch—the cry uv the nigger children wich coodent escape, symbolized their
                  desertid condishn, and the smell uv em ez<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7103-00000009"/>
                  they roasted wuz like unto incense, grateful to our nostrils.</p>
               <p>A informal meetin wuz to wunst organized by the lite of the burnin skool-house, to
                  wich Deekin Pogram addressed hisself. He remarked that this wuz a solemn occasion,
                  so solemn indeed that he felt inadekate to express the feelins wich filled him.
                  His mouth wuzn't big enough to give vent to his sole, though ef he didn't he'd
                  bust. "Wat are we met for to-nite, my friends?" sed he; "wat calls us together?
                  Wherefore these sounds uv joy—wherefore this fire, and wherefore is Bascom sellin
                  likker at half price? Becoz we are rehabilitated—that's wat we are. Becoz the
                  North hez gone into the olive branch bizness agin, and we hev wunst more our
                  rites. We are amnestied. We kin vote—we kin go to Congress—we are agin citizins uv
                  the great Republic."</p>
               <p>Pollock, the Illinoy storekeeper, riz and begged permishn to say a word. He
                  protested agin these doins. He understood, akkordin to Horris Greely's plan, that
                  yooniversal suffrage wuz to follow yooniversal amnesty—why then this makin John
                  Rodgerses uv the niggers? Wuz the South a goin to act in good faith?</p>
               <p>Deekin Pogram replied: The South never yit broke plighted faith save when she cood
                  make suthin by so doin. At this present junkter uv affairs he presoomed the South
                  wood extend, not precisely universal suffrage to the niggers, but the way wood be
                  opened to em. Sich a mass uv ignorance cood never be trusted with the ballot
                  without preparashen, and to prepare em wood be a overturnin the Kentucky theory,
                  that the nigger is a beast, and the Northern Demokratic idea that the nigger wuz
                  cust by Noer and doomed forever to be a slave.</p>
               <p>"The gentleman from Illinoy will to-wunst perceive the fix we are in. They ain't
                  fit for the ballot now, and ef we make em so, it overturns our theory, wich we
                  can't do. Still we propose to be just to em. We shel give sich uv em the ballot ez
                  are suffishently intellijent, and we shel not put the standard too high nuther. We
                  shel give every wun uv em the ballot who is able to reed the Greek testament
                  flooently and pass a credible examinashen in Lattin, embroidery, French, German,
                  English Grammar and double-entry book-keepin. The path to the polls, yoo see, is
                  open to em. Uv course we can't be expectid to tolerate skool-houses for em, coz
                  that wood raise em above their normal condishen. Also, ther must be proper
                  regulashens controllin em, for, my deer sir,<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000010"/> they are mere infants, and ther totterin steps on
                  the road to freedom needs directing. Society is a compromise in wich every one
                  resigns ez much uv his persnel liberty ez the good uv the hull may demand. We
                  count ourselves the hull, and the resinin uv persnel liberty must come from them.
                  That nigger," sed he, pintin to wun wich the joyous citizens wuz stringin up to
                  Bascom's sign-post, "that nigger is a resinin his persnel freedom for the good of
                  the hull. No doubt in his heart he murmurs, and ef the cord wich is chokin him
                  cood be loosened, he wood repine. It is rough on him; but the sooperiority uv the
                  Caucashn race must be—My God! it's one uv my niggers! Stop! Bascom, stop!"
                  ejackilated the Deekin, but it wuz too late. The nigger wuz already black in the
                  face and hed ceased to kick, and the Deekin, heavin a sigh, perceeded.</p>
               <p>"We shel scroopulously regard their rites. They shel hev the rite to buy land, and
                  be in all respecks like us, ez soon ez they kin be trusted. Till then they will
                  hev to be restrained. There must be laws prohibitin em from receivin more than
                  $450 per month, that they may not become bloated aristocrats and pampered sons uv
                  luxury—the proper development of the country, and likewise the payment of the
                  Confedrit debt, requires manuel labor, wich we wuz never edjucated to do, and
                  therefore the good of the whole requires that they shel resigne their persnel
                  liberty so fur ez to be confined to the plantashuns, onto which they hev engaged
                  to laber, that they may relijusly do it, which is cleerly nessary, for yoo see ef
                  I hire a nigger in Janooary, I must not be exposed to the chances uv his quittin
                  me in July. But wat more kin they want? They are free to ez great a extent ez the
                  good of sosiety will permit. We shel give em qualified suffrage, fixin, uv course,
                  wich is just, the qualifications ourselves, and bein valyooable members of
                  society, hereafter we shel care fur em, so long ez they are healthy—Good Lord, why
                  will them cusses persist in hangin up able-bodied niggers when there's so many old
                  ones around, good for nuthin but to celebrate with?" and to save another wun uv
                  his former servants, the Deekin closed abruptly.</p>
               <p>It is onnecessary to recount the further doins uv the nite. There wuz a
                  skool-house and church, recently erected, burnd, with some skore or sich a matter
                  uv young niggers in em, which wuz too young to be uv any yoose, save one girl,
                  wich wuz neerly white and almost fifteen, wich ought to hev bin reskood, and five,
                  ef I counted correctly, able-bodied men and wimin wuz hung. Bascom sold out his<pb
                     n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7103-00000011"/> stock entirely, and by 3 A. M. the entire
                  inhabitance uv the Corners wuz a layin around the square, in festoons.</p>
               <p>There wuz a bitter awakenin to this scene uv festivity. At a little after 7, while
                  the Deekin, the Elder, and myself, wuz in Bascom's tryin to get an assuager—and
                  the best we cood do wuz to pour a quart uv water into a barrel wich hed bin
                  emptied, and roll it around and thus flavor it—Captain McPelter, late uv Morgan's
                  cavalry, cum in from Looisville. Eagerly we asked him the confirmation uv the
                  tidins, when he informed us that it wuz a hoax—that no such thing hed been done,
                  nor wuz Congris in any sich a noshen. Pollock dropped in, and when I reproached
                  him with his dooplicity, he ansered that it wuz a hoax, but he hoped we'd excoose
                  him. He hed a cravin desire to see whether ef Amnesty and Suffrage shood be
                  adopted, how fur we'd go in the latter direction. He wuz satisfied, and honestly
                  hoped we'd forgive him the pleasant jest. He'd made the Corners lively one nite,
                  any how. I wuz too profoundly disgusted to reply to the wretch.</p>

               <p>SQUARE Gavitt, Deekin Pogram, Capt. McPelter and myself wuz in the Post Offis last
                  nite, wich, next to Bascom's, hez got to be the cheef resort uv the leading
                  intellex uv the Corners, a talkin over matters and things, when the Deekin
                  happened to menshun that next week his second son, Elijer, who hez intelleck into
                  him, was a goin to start for Michigan to enter a college.</p>
               <p>"Wat!" sed I, "do yoo perpose to send that noble yooth, Elijer Pogram, to a
                  Ablishn State, to enter a Ablishn college, to suck his knollege from a Ablishn
                  mother? Good Heavens! Frailty, thy name is woman.</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7103-00000012"/>
               <p>[I hedn't any ijee that this last remark wuz appropos, but it sounds well, and I
                  hev notist that it don't make much difference wat the cotashun is so ez yoo end a
                  remark with a cotoshun.]</p>
               <p>The Deekin remarked that it wuz painful; but the fact wuz, Elijer must hev a
                  edjucashen. He didn't bleeve in edjucashen, generally speekin. The common people
                  wuz better off without it, ez edjucashen hed a tendency to unsettle their minds.
                  He hed seen the evil effex uv it in niggers and poor whites. So soon ez a nigger
                  masters the spellin book and gits into noosepapers, he becomes dissatisfied with
                  his condishn, and hankers after a better cabin and more wages. He to-wunst begins
                  to insist onto ownin land hisself, and givin his children educashen, and, ez a
                  nigger, for our purposes, aint worth a soo markee. Jes so with the poor whites. He
                  knowd one melloncolly instance. A poor cuss up toards Garrittstown, named Ramsey,
                  learnt to read afore the war, and then commenst deterioratin. For two years he
                  refoozed to vote the Dimocratic ticket, then he blossomed out into a Ablishnist
                  and tried to make the others uv his class discontented by tellin uv em that
                  Slavery wuz wat kept them down, and finally, after pashense ceased to be a
                  virchoo, and we tarred and fethered him one nite for a incendiary, he went to
                  Injiany. That cuss cum back here, doorin the late onpleasantniss, kernel of a
                  rigiment, wich he campt on my farm and subsisted em off it.</p>
               <p>"Sum educashen is, however, nessary. I design Elijer for Congris, and he must hev
                  it. He's a true Pogram, and nothin will strike in wich kin hurt him."</p>
               <p>"Why not," sez I, "that the Southern yooth may be properly trained, start a
                  College uv our own? Why, Deekin, run risks uv hevin the minds uv our young men
                  tainted with heresy?"</p>
               <p>The entire company wuz struck with the idea, and it wuz earnestly canvassed, and
                  finally decided upon; and I wuz deppytized to start it, wich I immejitly did. The
                  name by wich the new college is to be known is "The Southern Classikle,
                  Theologikle and Military Institoot uv Confedrit X Roads (wich is in the Stait uv

               <p>In the Scientific and Classikle Departments the text-books will be keerfully

               <p>I shell myself lectur, from time to time, on Ham, Hager and Onesimus, that the

               <p>The young men confided to our care will receive not only a solid collegiate
                  educashun, ez it is understood at the North, but careful attention will be paid to
                  the accomplishments so nessary to the troo Southern gentleman. They will be taught
                  draw poker, pitchin dollars (real Spanish dollars will be provided for the
                  purpose), spittin at a mark, revolver and bowie knife practice, tournament ridin
                  at rings (real injy rubber rings will be provided—this'll be extra), and

                  No card-playin will be allowed afore servis on Sunday, and none watever with the

               <p>Uv course, there will hev to be a large outlay uv money, wich it stands to reason
                  can't be outlayed till it's inlayed.</p>
               <p>We, therefore, formed an Executive Committe, whose dooty it wuz made to solissit

               <p>I hev hopes in the course uv a week to report progress. Every subscriber uv $2.50

               <p>I HEERD, nearly two months ago, that my old friend, John Guttle, uv Mobeel, hed
                  departed this life and gone to that other and better world where the wicked cease
                  from troublin and the weery are at rest, and wuz profoundly shocked. John Guttle
                  wuz my friend, and I much feer his like I ne'er shall look upon agin. He wuz a
                  Democrat uv the old skool, one uv the few links wich remaned to connect the
                  present generation with the past. Well do I remember the gellorious old man! How
                  often hev I set in the square room in his country residence, and drunk wiskey and
                  water with him till we neither on us could see a hole thro a fortyfoot ladder; how
                  many times hez he flogged niggers<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7103-00000016"/> for my
                  amoozment, to show me the proper way uv managin uv em; and how many times hez he
                  lent me small sums uv money, varyin from five to thirtyone dollars, akkordin to
                  the state uv mellernis he wuz in when I approached him on the delikit subjik!
                  Alas! poor John Guttle. Let not the skoffer say that I regret his death becoz his
                  sons will be apt to try and collect the notes the old man departed holds uv mine!
                  No, no! they know me too well to waste any time on that. I mourn becoz I loved
                  him, and becoz uv the misfortunes which druv him to a prematoor grave. A. Linkin
                  is responsible for this dark shadder onto my pathway. John Guttle hed three
                  hundred niggers on his plantashens and in his house in town—these wuz wrencht from
                  him by the Proclamashen, and turned out from his paternal care to starve, which
                  the most uv em are industrously doin at about $3 per day. He hed em uv all
                  hues—there wuz the full-blooded Black, the disgustin Mulatter, the pleasant
                  Quadroon, the beautiful Octoroon, and them which hed so nearly lost the cuss of
                  Ham ez to be hardly distinguishable from the pure Caucashun; and it wuz noticeable
                  that the nearly white niggers on the Guttleses plantatin wuz all beautiful. The
                  Guttleses theirselves wuz perfeck specimens uv manly beauty, and it probably hed
                  its effeck upon the blacks. The nigger is a imitative animal.</p>
               <p>It wuz this robbin uv him uv his property—this overturnin uv the normal condishn
                  uv things—which killed John Guttle. He never held up his head after the
                  Proclamashen, but faded away like a frostid flower!</p>
               <p>I wus in Mobeel last week on biznis connected with our college (it wuz solisitin
                  funds to endow my Professorship), and I felt that I cood not leave the sity
                  without droppin a dozen teers or sich onto his grave. I felt, ez he hed
                  contribbitted at various times so much to moisten my clay, that it would be
                  ungentlemanly not to do suthin toward moistenin hizzen. And in pursuance uv my
                  resolve, I wended my way sadly to the cemetry, and, findin the tomb, struck an
                  attitood uv dispair, and leanin pensively onto the moniment, strove, to the best
                  uv my ability, to weep, but it wuz a futile endeavor. My eyes woodent give down. I
                  strove to recall his virchoos, but sich is the weaknis uv human nacher that
                  whenever his form rose in my memory, my mind involuntarily wandered to his wiskey,
                  and my mouth would water to sich an extent ez to monopolize all the moisture in my
                  system. I cood hev spit onto<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7103-00000017"/> his grave,
                  but weep I could not. Alas for poor humanity!</p>
               <p>When I wuz a standin there tryin to weep, and makin a bad fist uv it, I notist
                  three beautiful young ladies approachin, with baskits ov hot-house flowers a
                  hangin onto their arms. I recognized em to-wunst. They wuz John Guttle's
                  daughters, and they wuz a comin to strew flowers onto the grave uv their paternal
                  ancestor on their father's side. It wuz a techin site; and feelin that I wuz a
                  introoder, not bein a blood relashun, and only connected with the deceest by notes
                  uv hand, I withdrew a short distants. Skasely had they got to the tomb, when from
                  the other side approached three more ravishinly beautiful young ladies, with
                  baskits uv hot-house flowers onto their arms. The last ones resembled in a strikin
                  manner the fust ones, ceptin they wuz a shade darker, and their hare waved
                  bootiful, where as the hare uv the fust wuz perfeckly strate.</p>
               <p>The two parties faced each other on opposite sides uv the toom, and party Number
                  One glared fiercely at party Number Two.</p>
               <p>"Lize! Flora! Jane!" sed the oldest uv party Number One, "wat are yoo doin
                  here?"</p>
               <p>"Sisters," sed the eldest uv party Number Two, "we're here dischargin a fillyel
                  dooty. Beneeth these sod lies the remains uv our father, and we are goin to strew
                  these flowers onto his toom. Jine us in the strew."</p>
               <p>"Father?" shreeked the three uv party Number One. "Yoor all niggers and wuz
                  servants unto—"</p>
               <p>"Our half-sisters," sed the spokesman uv party Number Two; "but Linkin removed the
                  cuss uv Ham, and we're now free, and hev ez much rite to strew the grave uv our
                  common parient, which wuz John Guttle, ez yoo. O! our sisters, our father wuz a
                  good man—let us bedew his grave with our teers and—"</p>
               <p>"Wat impudence!" shreeked party Number One, all in korious.</p>
               <p>"Impudence yoorself!" retorted party Number Two, getting red in the face. "We are
                  John Guttleses daughters percisely ez much ez yoo, and the only advantage yoo hev
                  over us is in the article of mothers. Yoo three hev wun, which wuz John Guttleses
                  wife, while we three hev three—one apiece eggsackly—which wuz John Guttleses
                  servants; but we can't, nevertheless, stifle our emoshuns. I shel command myself,
                  and thus perceed to perform a act uv fillyel dooty."</p>
               <p>And she histed out the flowers and commenced to strew.</p>
               <pb n="34 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7103-00000018"/>
               <p>The tother wuns wuz a gettin hot. The oldest wun cood stand this impudence no
                  longer, and droppin her basket, went for her, follered by her sisters. It wuz a
                  sperited conflict, and lasted perhaps four minits, or until I parted em, when they
                  gathered themselves together, and departed—one party went one way, and tother,
                  tother.</p>
               <p>Fillyel love hed done more in the strewin biznis than it sot out to do. The six
                  lovin daughters uv the deceest John hed not only strewed flowers onto his grave,
                  but hair, and collars, and buzzum pins, and shreds uv silk, and water-falls, and
                  cotton, and false teeth, and pieces uv almost everything which goes to make up the
                  sum total uv female attire.</p>
               <p>Ez I gazed at the wreck and saw their tattered forms vanish in the dim distance, I
                  cood not help admittin that when it come to strewin the graves uv deceest
                  ancestors, there wuz sum disadvantages attendin the patriarkle system.</p>

               <p>FOR two weeks past I hev bin in North Carolina, and hev hed an oppertoonity uv
                  bein uv service to my friends and the good cause.</p>
               <p>I wuz there collectin funds fur the new College at this pint, to wich I am devoted
                  heart and sole, and wuz a makin my home at Kernel Abslum Podgers, who resides just
                  back of Rawly, and whose table and cellar, permit me to say, are unsurpassed in
                  the South. Kernel Podgers is a gentleman uv the old skool, who lives in luxurious
                  elegance onto a plantashn uv 1500 akers, and who hez troo piety into him, and
                  alluz wears a shirtfrill. Afore the war he owned 200 niggers, and his sole runnin
                  out after em, he hez managed,<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7103-00000020"/> sence the
                  war, to collect the most uv em and get em together on the old place. He hez bin
                  busily engaged in subdooin uv em and bringing em back to ther normal condishun;
                  but alas! ther wuz difficulties in the way. The men niggers, with an obstinacy
                  wich I can't account for, refused to work for $4 per month, and the wimen, hevin
                  ben mostly married to ther husbands by the chaplin uv a regiment wich wuz
                  stashened here doorin the war, refused to resoom their old relations, and things
                  looked serious. Most men would hev yielded to circumstances and give up, but
                  Kernel Podgers wuz not uv that stripe. He owed a dooty to these misguided beins
                  wich he felt he must fulfil; and besides, he is desirous of buildin a new house
                  next summer and sendin two daughters (by his wife) to a seminary next season, and
                  he felt that he must bring em to their senses. He sed that he stood in the
                  relation uv a father, figgeratively speekin, to all uv em, and literally to many
                  uv em; and wuz he agoin to let em go on a flyin out ov their normal speer? Not
                  any.</p>
               <p>The fust day I wuz there, a crisis occurred. John Podgers, his son, insisted upon
                  takin away the wife uv a mulatto, and the nigger, forgettin his posishen, wuz
                  impudent. John struck him, and the degraded wretch waded in and whaled him
                  unmerciful. This, uv course, cood not be endoored. The Podgers' blood riz, and
                  that nigger wuz seized and catted till he died. Ef I remember right, he expired
                  while undergoin discipline. It may be he lived till mornin; but it matters not,
                  ceptin that I like to be accurate.</p>
               <p>It wuz a solem and impressive scene. The Kernel had the Ethiopian's wife present
                  doorin the infliction uv the punishment, and to show her that he did not perceed
                  without authority, before commencin he read to her from Scripter the chapters
                  treatin uv Ham and Hager, and the passage commencin "servance, obey your masters,"
                  and then walloped him with more vigger than I spozed wuz left in a man so old. He
                  pinted to the nigger on the ground, after he wuz cut down, and tellin her that he
                  hoped it wood be a lesson to her, bade her go to her quarters. But the perverse
                  creecher didn't. She ran away and complained to the officer at the neerest post,
                  who instid uv sendin uv her back under guard, with his compliments to Kernel
                  Podgers, actilly forwarded her complaint to Gen. Sickles, who forthwith struck a
                  blow at the foundashens uv the fabric uv Southern sosiety,<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000021"/> and ordered the arrest uv the Kernel, who wuz
                  towunst placed in doorance vile.</p>
               <p>There wuz eggscitement in the visinity. I never saw sich a fermentashen. Men run
                  to and fro with blancht cheeks, and askt, "Wat next? Is our rites to be taken from
                  us? Is Johnson a holler mockery?" And they made up a purse, and begged me to go to
                  Androo, and stand between em and destruckshen. I run up to Washinton, and hed an
                  interview with his Eggslency, the President. He knowd Kernel Podgers,—in his
                  younger days he hed made his coats,—and ez I tetched upon the old man immured in a
                  dismal dungeon, he wept. But A. Johnson hez decision uv character. Wipin his eyes,
                  he isshood a order for the revokashen uv Sickleses absurd order that niggers
                  shoodent be whipt, and a speshl order commandin the offiser who hed the Kernel in
                  custody, to turn him over to the Civil Courts, to be tried in accordance with the
                  laws of North Karliny.</p>
               <p>Armed with these documents, I flew back, and the nite I arrived I hed the
                  satisfackshen uv takin the Kernel out uv Jail, and takin him afore a Justis uv the
                  Peace, where he gave bail to appear afore the Common Pleas to answer a charge uv
                  manslaughter slaughter, prefered by the widder uv the dead nigger.</p>
               <p>A day or two after, the case wuz heard, I appearin for the Kernel. I held that the
                  case be dismissed for the followin reason:—</p>
               <p>1. The charge uv manslaughter wuz absurd, for the reason that in the minds uv the
                  Southern people there hez alluz bin the gravest doubts ez to whether the nigger is
                  actilly a man. I held that the length uv his heel, the thickness uv his skull, the
                  length uv his arm, all showd that he wuz uv a distink species. Ef this is the
                  case, ez a matter uv course the Kernel goes free.</p>
               <p>2. The Kernel can't be held, allowin the nigger to be a man. The laws uv the State
                  uv North Karliny permit the whippin uv niggers, but they don't prescribe the
                  quantity uv whippin wich may be inflicted. It's a matter wich is left entirely to
                  the discreshen of the whipper. It's a matter with wich the whippee hez nothin to
                  do; neither hez the State. Ef the Kernel hed shot the nigger he wood be liable,
                  for shootin ain't permitted; but ez whippin is, and ez the quantity ain't
                  prescribed, uv course it intends the matter to be left solely to the discreshen uv
                  the party who hez the power to whip. Nothin kin be clearer than that. Shel Kernel
                     Podgers<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7103-00000022"/> gers be punisht becoz a nigger
                  hedn't powers uv endoorence? Forbid it heven!</p>
               <p>Here I rested the case. I showed to the satisfackshen uv the Court that the law
                  was not only just but humane, and that any sich absurdity ez punishin the Kernel
                  for carryin out its pervisions wood be strikin a blow at the framework uv
                  society.</p>
               <p>The Court coincided with me, and to-wunst discharged the Kernel, amid the
                  acclamashuns uv the crowd. The event wuz sellebratid that afternoon by whippin
                  every nigger within a cirkle uv ten miles. The exercise did our people good. It
                  wuz soothin.</p>
               <p>In the mean time John Podgers hed gone afore a Justice uv the Peace and made
                  complaint uv Susan (that is the name uv the female wich wuz the cause uv the
                  diffikilty) ez a vagrant, and she wuz so declared by the Justis and put up and
                  sold. Under the circumstances no one wood bid agin John, and she was struck off to
                  him at $50, wich the Justis under the pecoolyer circumstances uv the case refoosed
                  to take. I saw John a marchin uv her home, and felt happy.</p>
               <p>The Kernel's gratitood wuz boundlis.</p>
               <p>"Wat kin I do for yoo?" sed he, wringin my hand in a fever uv joy.</p>
               <p>"Nothin," sed I, "nothin! Virchoo is its own reward. But our College is languishin
                  for want uv means—let yoor gratitood take that shape."</p>
               <p>He subscribed and paid $200, wich constoots him a perpetooal Honorary Perfesser,
                  and $100 to make his wife a perpetooal Honorary Perfesser. I borrowd uv him $50 to
                  take me home, ez I coodent uv coorse yoose College funds, and departed $350
                  better. I left regretfully. Now that this portion uv the South is gettin her
                  rites, it is trooly a deliteful place too live, and I shood like to end my days
                  here. But my post offis, and that college!—I kin never leave em, never. To that
                  college I hev dedikated the few remainin years uv my life, and I'll never desert
                  it so long ez there's a dollar to be raised for it out uv anybody.</p>

               <p>ON my return from my trip to North Karliny ther wuz an immejit and irrepressible
                  desire on the part uv the Trustees uv the Institoot, to hev a statement from me uv
                  the results of the trip. Much hed bin expectid from the vencher, and the
                  expectashuns uv the Trustees wuz riz to a pitch from wich I felt it wuz crooil to
                  hurl em. Therefore I dodged em, until finally, bein badgered, I thort I wood end
                  it. Hevin prepared the dockyments, I named the Post Offis ez the place, and the

               <p>The brethren wuz somewat disappointed at the result, and Bascom intimated that he
                  bleeved it wuz a d—d swindle; but I withered him with a glance. I showed Deekin
                  Pogram that it wuz not only reglar, but that it hed the stamp uv the Post Offis
                  onto it, wich silenced all cavil. I asshoored em that that little balance needn't
                  trouble em—I did not intend to make an assessment onto em, but that I cood wait
                  until the treasury wuz in funds.</p>
               <p>"But," sed Bascom, "when in thunder will the treasury ever be in funds, ef all the
                  expedishuns result like this one?"</p>
               <p>I explained to the obtoose man that it wuz all rite; that in most uv sich
                  enterprises the expenses eat up the collekshuns, but that it wuz seed sown. "We
                  must," sez I, "raise the wind from the North, and to do it, let us show that
                  suthin hez bin dun."</p>
               <p>"Wat kin we do?" sed Bascom.</p>
               <p>"Lay the corner stun uv the Institoot?" sez I. "On the square forninst us is the
                  corner stun uv the nigger church we burnt a month or so ago, ready to our hand.
                  Let us organize a percession and do it to-day, that we may publish to the world
                  that the work is commenced, that our friends may shell out libreller than they
                  hev."</p>
               <p>The idea wuz considered good, and forthwith it wuz actid upon. The stone wuz
                  conveyed to the feeld onto wich the Institoot is to be built, and a cavity wuz
                  hollered out into it.</p>
               <p>At 4 P. M. (wich is in the afternoon) a percession wuz formed, headed by the
                  Trustees, and we marched out to the feeld. Into the cavity in the stun wuz
                  deposited, with approprit ceremonies, the followin articles:—</p>

                  blood bedoozlin it, and after a few feelin remarks by myself, in wich<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000025"/> I stated that this wuz a grate day for the Corners,
                  and that posterity wood bless us for the work we hed that day done, the crowd
                  dispersed, the Trustees goin back to my offis to draw up a statement uv the
                  ceremonies, and an appele to the northern Dimocrisy for aid.</p>
               <p>The nigger wich we whipt at the corner stun wuz shot in a dispoot by Capt.
                  McPelter, wich circumstances greatly annoyed Deekin Pogram, ez it wus a nigger
                  wich wuz formerly hizzen. He remonstrated with the Captain angrily, and ashoord
                  him that ez soon ez the Soopreme Court hed declared the Amendment abolishin
                  slavery unconstooshnel, he shood sue him for his value. With this triflin
                  excepshun, the affair passed off ez pleasantly ez cood be wished. I remonstrated
                  with both uv em for quarrelin, on sich a occasion, over so small a matter ez the
                  shootin uv a nigger, and they finally settled it without hard feelins. How sweet
                  is peace and friendliness atween man and man! How blessid is the offis uv a peace
                  maker! The captain acknowledged he wuz wrong, and stood the drinks for the
                  crowd.</p>
               <p>That nite about 9 P. M., I wuz a sittin in my offis a musin onto the evence uv the
                  day, and wonderin whether the Dimocrisy wood give down, it okkured to me that
                  there wuz a pint bottle uv first-class corn wisky, and $5 in currency agoin to
                  waste in that stun.</p>
               <p>"Wat'll posterity ever know uv us?" thot I to myself. "Ef posterity does ever
                  overturn that stun, won't she git jest ez good an idea uv who we wuz from the
                  other articles? Ef posterity ever reads the speeches uv His Eggslency, and the
                  messages wich we hev placed there, won't the wisky be inferred? Ef it ain't,
                  posterity is a consumate ass;" and thus musin, I wended my way thitherward,
                  determined to reskoo these two articles from oblivion any how.</p>
               <p>It wuz pitch dark, but I knew the way. Creepin cautiously up to the stun, I
                  reached out; and horror! Ther wuz another hand onto it! Strikin a match quickly,
                  there stood reveeled afore me the forms uv Deekin Pogram, Bascom, and Elder
                  Slathers, to whom the same thot hed occurred wich moved me. But my presence uv
                  mind did not forsake me. Strikin another match, I assoomed a look uv virchus
                  indignashen, wich they all saw afore it went out, and reproacht em fur ther
                  worldly-mindednis. How cood they expect the Institoot to prosper when those into
                  whose hands its interests wuz confided, proves recreant to the extent uv steeling
                  the sacred mementoes wich were to-day enclosed. "Go home," sed<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000026"/> I; "I forgive you this time, and will not expose
                  yoo ez yoo deserve. I spected yoo all, from the way yoo eyed the bottle and the
                  greenback, and hastened hither to protect em. Go!"</p>
               <p>And they went; after wich I tipped over the stun and sekoored the prize.</p>
               <p>The next mornin they all reproached me with hevin stolen the articles, in privit,
                  wich satisfied me that all uv em hed gone back for the plunder after they thot I'd
                  gone; but they didn't make no fuss about it. They are all good men; but alas! sich
                  is the depravity uv human nacher that they'll bear watchin.</p>
               <p>I await with anxiety the result uv our appeal to the Northern Democrisy. Ef they
                  fail us ez shamefully ez they did durin the war, it is all up with us.</p>

               <p>I WUZ rekested a week ago to preech a discourse from the text wich the noble and
                  high-minded Guvner Bramlette used with sich crushin force in his last annual
                  message, to wit: "Kin the Leopard change his spots or the Ethiopian his skin?" and

                  essayed to do it.</p>
               <p>And here let me remark, that there ain't a more devoted people in Kentucky than
                  them lambs ez compose my flock. It wuz a tetchin site, and one wich filled my sole
                  with joy, to see em pour out uv the groceries at the first tootin uv the horn, and
                  to see Pennebacker, wich owns the Distillery, stoppin work to come, but the most

                  me wuz to see Deekin Pogram, who was playin seven-up for the drinks with Elder
                  Slathers, at Bascom's, lay down his hand when he hed high low and jack in it, and
                  hed only three to go. "Elder," sed he, his voice tremblin at the sacrifice he wuz
                  a makin, and a tear steelin down his cheek, "Elder, them's the horn. Let us to our
                  dooties. 'Ligion must take the front seat uv temp'ral matters," and sighin ez he
                  cast a partin glance at his hand, he strode out resolootly to the sanktooary.</p>
               <p>I opened by readin the follerin from Guvner Bramlette's message.</p>
               <p>"'The nigger is the inferior uv the white—he lacks the power to rise. Ontil the
                  Leopard kin change his spots, or the Ethiopian his skin, all efforts to repeal or
                  nullify God's laws will be unavailin.</p>
               <p>"My bretherin, these words is words uv wisdom, and fur em let us be thankful. The
                  skin uv the Ethiopian wuz inflicted onto him for the express purpose uv
                  distingishin him from his bretherin, whose servants he wuz condemned to be, for
                  all time, ez a punishment for the sin uv Cain or the improodence uv Ham, wich
                  Democratic divines heven't settled on. With the black skin he wuz given all the
                  other marks uv inferiority. He wuz cust with long arms, immense hands, flat nose,
                  and bowed legs, and that ther mite be no mistake in the matter, he wuz given wool
                  instead uv hair. Halleloogy!</p>
               <p>"Ah, my brethern, wat a blessid thing for us is this Ethiopian! Wat a consolation
                  it must be to yoo all to know that ther is a race below yoo, and how blessid the
                  refleckshun that they can't change ther skin, and by that means git above yoo!
                  That's the comfort we draw from the skripters. Wat a horror it wood be for Deekin
                  Pogram, who is snorin so peacefly, <q>
                     <l>'Dreamin, sweetly dreamin the happy hours away,'</l>
                  </q> ef when the Soopreme Court decides the Ablishn amendment unconstooshnl, and
                  he gits his niggers back agin; ef ther shood be a new dispensashun, and niggers
                  shood be permitted to change ther skins! Wat sekoority wood we hev for our
                  property? Some mornin he'd wake up and find em all white persons, wich it wood be
                  unconstooshnel to wollop.</p>
               <p>"My brethern, ther hez bin many efforts to change the skin uv the Ethiopian, or
                  rather ther hez bin many who wanted to. The Boston Ablishnists<pb n="52-53"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000028"/> lishnists hev tried it, but wat hez bin the result?
                  Ain't they niggers yit, and ain't they still the degraded wretches they alluz wuz?
                  I paws for a reply."</p>
               <p>I made this latter remark becoz, and only becoz, it sounded well, not that I hed
                  any idee that anybody wood reply. Imagine my surprise at seein a gray-headed
                  nigger, wich hed bin, doorin and after the fratrisidle struggle, employed in the
                  Freedman's Burow, rise, and remark that he hed a word to say onto that pint. There
                  wuz a storm uv indignashun, and the impudent nigger, who wuz so sassy ez to
                  presoom to speek in a white meetin, wood hev bin sacrificed on the spot, hed not
                  Joe Bigler, who wuz half drunk, drawd a ugly-lookin navy revolver, and remarkin
                  that he knowd that nigger, that he hed more sense than the hull bilin uv us, and
                  he shood hev his say.</p>
               <p>"Ef," sed this recklis Joe, "ef he beats yoo, Perfesser, trooth is trooth; lets
                  hev it. Ef he don't, why, it's all the better for yoo. Ef yoor Websterian intellek
                  kivers the ground, all rite; ef his ponderous intellek gets the best on't, jist ez
                  rite. 'Out uv the mouths uv babes and sucklins.' Elder, I go my bottom dollar on
                  this sucklin. Speek up, venerable: there won't none uv em tech yoo;" and he cockt
                  his revolver.</p>
               <p>"Beggin pardon," sed the nigger, "I agree with yoo, Perfesser, that the Ethiopian
                  can't change his skin hisself, but does the Scripter say that it can't be changed
                  for him?"</p>
               <p>"Anser the venrable babe," sed Joe Bigler, pintin his revolver at me.</p>
               <p>"I can't say that it does," sez I.</p>
               <p>"Very good," retorted the nigger, "hezn't there a change bin a goin on in Kaintuck
                  from the beginnin? My mother wuz ez black ez a crow—I'm considble lighter—my
                  wife's a half lighter than I am—my gal's childern is a half lighter than their
                  mother, and I want to know wat Guvner Bramlette's got to say to that. The white
                  man ain't got no cuss onto him, hez he?"</p>
               <p>"Speek up Perfesser—the sucklin wants yoo to be prompt," sed Joe Bigler.</p>
               <p>I answered that "he hed not—that it wuz piled onto Ham or Cain and their
                  desendants, and nobody else."</p>
               <p>"Very well, then," sed the nigger, chucklin all over, "ez I am only half Ham or
                  Cain (wich, you hevn't decided), then uv coarse there's only half a cuss onto me,
                  only a quarter onto my wife, only an eighth onto my daughters, only a sixteenth
                  onto my daughters' childern, and there's lots uv niggers in<pb n="54-55"

                  or the sixty-fouth part uv it hangin to em. Guvner Bramlette also sed suthin bout
                  niggers bein degraded coz twuz their nacher, didn't he, and that edducashen
                  woodent do for em?"</p>
               <p>"Perfesser," sed the tormentin Bigler, wich hed just whisky enuff into him to be
                  ugly, "I must remind yoo that the partikeler babe and sucklin, out uv whose mouth
                  yoor bein immensely condemned, expex prompt ansers, or rather I, his guardian and
                  pertecter do."</p>
               <p>I ansered that sich wuz the tenor uv the Guvner's remarks.</p>
               <p>"Ef that's troo, why don't the mulattoes come up faster? Ef it's the nateral
                  stoopidity uv the nigger, the white man ain't effected by it, and the mulatto only
                  half. I are 'quainted with the heft uv the people afore me, and I'll bet my last
                  year's wages, wich Deekin Pogram ain't paid yit, that half uv em can't read any
                  mor'n I kin. 'Pears to me I'd like to hev Guvner Bramlette take the load off us
                  for a year two and see whether we'd rise or not. We moutn't and then agin we mout.
                  But I ruther think its a leetle too much to put a millstone on top uv a man and
                  then kick him for not gettin up."</p>
               <p>"Bully!" sed Joe Bigler. "Go on! go on!"</p>
               <p>"It ain't just square playin to make all sorts uv laws agin our risin, to flog us
                  for hevin spellinbooks, to make it a penitentiary offence to learn to read, and to
                  burn our skool houses, and then because we ain't just ready to enter college, to
                  insist on't that we are naterally incapable. And above all, ain't it presoomin a
                  little to charge it onto the Lord? Ain't yoo mistakin your own work for hizzen?
                  'Praps ef Guvner Bramlette's father hed bin flogg'd for wantin to learn to read,
                  and Guvner Bramlette's mother hed bin brought up ez a feeld hand, and the same
                  strategy hed bin practised on Guvner Bramlette's grandfather, and great
                  grandfather, and great, great grandfather, and great, great, great grandfather,
                  and his great—"</p>
               <p>"Hold on, venerable," sed Joe Bigler, "don't enumerate. Jest say his ancestors,
                  back to the identicle time they wuz slaves to them Normans, wich held his
                  projenitors jist ez closely ez yoo've bin held, and it'll be suffishent. But go
                  on."</p>
               <p>"I plead guilty to the big hands, flat nose, and bowd legs. Possibly the first
                  nigger hed em—possibly not. Ef Guvner Bramlette's father, and his grand-fa—wich is
                  to say ancestors, hed bin kept at the hoe, his hands wood hev bin ez big ez mine;

               <p>"Hev yoo eny more questions to put to the Perfesser?" sed Joseph.</p>
               <p>"No," replied the Ethiopian, "I hev sed my say."</p>
               <p>"Then," sed this Bigler, wich wuz gettin more and more reckless every minnit, "I
                  dismiss this congregashun, with this remark, that that nigger is under my
                  protectin care, and ef a single lock uv his wool is disturbed, I shel feel it a

               <p>And pell-mell the congregashen piled out—one over another.</p>
               <p>It will be necessary to dispose of Joe Bigler somehow. He lost wat property he hed

                  Yankees, and, uv course they'd be swindld, which alluz intensifies their rage. A
                  batch uv em sent for tickets to Crosby's Opera House, which didn't reach Chicago,
                  ez I wuz behind with my board, and after givin em the regular explanashen, they
                  wuz so enraged at the theevin ablishnists at Chicago, that they sallied out and
                  made it lively for wat niggers they met. I forget now, but ef I remember right,
                  they hung two, or wuz it three? My memry is failin.</p>
               <p>But ez I wuz sayin, I hev plenty uv time, and I put it in mostly studyin the
                  caracteristiks uv human nacher, ez developed in men and niggers. While
                  contemplatin a parsel uv niggers one day, I follered em, and overheard their
                  conversashen. I wuz astonished! They wuz notifyin one another uv a meetin to be
                  held that nite in Pennibacker's barn, to which all wuz expected to be present.
                  Here, thot I to myself, is Guy Fawkes! Here is conspiracy! Meetin! Wat rite hev
                  niggers to meet! And I hastened to Deekin Pogram and told him wat I had heerd.</p>
               <p>"Nasby," sed he, wringin my hand, "ef I ever doubted the eternel fitnis uv
                  things—the complete and entire adaptability uv one class to another—that doubt is
                  removed. Here am I, a nigger owner—here are yoo, a Northern Dimocrat—a bloomin
                  eggsotic ez I may say, wich hez took root in Southrn sile. I never wood hev
                  overherd them niggers!—no Southner wood hev thot uv sneakin after em—for all sich
                  work the Northern Dimocrat is precisely fitted. It's wat they've alluz done for
                  us! alluz! alluz! alluz!"</p>
               <p>And he wrung my hand again, and thanked me. I wuz too much overcome with emoshen
                  at the compliment he paid me to reply. But we arranged the programme. We went to
                  the barn, and overturned a wagon so ez we cood git under it and heer all that wuz
                  sed without bein seen, and jest at nitefall the Deekin and me ensconsd ourselves
                  in our hidin place.</p>
               <p>The niggers gathered, praps thirty on em, and opened the meetin with prayer, in
                  which exercise they hed the profanity to pray for the Government uv the Yoonited
                  States and sich, and then the biznis commenst. It appears that they'd sent a man
                  North to find a locashen for em, ez they hed made up their minds to run away from
                  the blessins uv slavery wich we are preparin to re-open to em, and this nigger<pb
                     n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7103-00000032"/> hed arrived, and they wuz assembled to
                  hear his report.</p>
               <p>"Brother Lee," sed the ringleader to the returned nigger, wich I knowd—he wuz
                  nearly white, and wuz raised in Virginia, and hed bin four years in the army, on
                  the Fedral side uv course,—"are yoo ready to report? Hev yoo found the Promised
                  Land?"</p>
               <p>Brother Lee replied, that ef he understood wat wuz the Ethiopian idee uv the
                  "Promised Land," he cood safely and certainly say that he hedn't. He landed first
                  in Philadelphy, and bein sumwat wearied by the long ride, he took a seat in a
                  streetcar which wuz empty. The condukter ordered him out, but sposin he wuz in a
                  State where there wuz ekal rites he insisted on stayin, when the condukter and the
                  driver bundled him out by force. His coat, he observed, showin wher the bloo
                  blouse hed bin onskilfully mendid, wuz sumwat fraktered in the skuffle.</p>
               <p>At this narrashen the niggers groaned, and it wuz all I cood do to keep the Deekin
                  from hollerin halleloogy!</p>
               <p>In Noo York State he didn't fare so well. He diskivered that a decent nigger there
                  isn't quite ez good ez a very ordinary white man. He happened ther on 'leckshin
                  day, and narrated that he saw white men carried up to the poles so eggstremely
                  drunk that them ez hed em in charge hed to put the ticket atween their fingers and
                  anser to their names, while a 'spectable nigger hed to show that he wuz worth some
                  property afore he wuz allowed to vote, and then a number uv gentlemen with red
                  faces and clubs made it so onpleasant that but few attempted it.</p>
               <p>The Deekin punched me in the ribs vociferously.</p>
               <p>Next he went to Ohio, sposin, uv course, that a State so extremely opposed to
                  bondage wood be the place he wuz in search uv. Agin he wuz disappointed. It wuz
                  worse than it wuz in Noo York, for the Ablishnists wuz a going on the principle,
                  he rather guessed, uv doin justis without runnin agin anybody's prejudises; or
                  rather, uv lettin justice do herself, for they don't make any move towards helpin
                  her. There the nigger uv no grade, no matter how much he pade taxes onto, or how
                  long he served in the army, wuzn't allowed a vote. The Ablishinists, ez he
                  understood, tho praps he wuz wrong, carried the state on the nigger question, but
                  wuz now afrade to tetch it for fear they'd lose it agin. They've hed it, he
                  remarked, 12 years, but<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7103-00000033"/> hedn't, ez yit,
                  got all the people edjicated up to the pint uv doin wat all the people knowd wuz
                  rite.</p>
               <p>His experience in the West wuz very similar. The Ablishnists wuz everywhere very
                  strongly in the majority, and every wun uv 'em he talked with wuz in favor of
                  givin the nigger his rites, but they wuz all afraid ef they took hold uv it,
                  they'd be laid out by the Democracy, which wuznt in the majority at all. In
                  Washinton, wher Congress hez give the niggers a vote, he wuz well treated, and it
                  wuz the only place. A gentleman who wants to run for Mayor next spring giv him his
                  dinner, and quite a number of others who wanted small offises did likewise, but he
                  woodent advise emigrashen there, for the reason that ther wuz too many there now;
                  and besides it's possible that before the next elecshun Congress may conclude that
                  suffrage in the Deestrick will run 'em into the ground in the States (their
                  constituents, which are all Ablishnists, not bein edjucated up to the pint), and
                  repeel it.</p>
               <p>The Deekin nudged me agin.</p>
               <p>"Wat shel we do?" then sed the niggers, all in korious.</p>
               <p>"Do!" sed the nigger, wich his name it wuz Lee, "do! grin and bear it wher yoo
                  are. Ez fo' me, ef I hed my five yeahs back agin I shood do diffrent. Liberty is a
                  gift hoss, wich, ef dis niggah hed it to do ober agin, he wood look in de mouth,
                  shoah. I shood want to know whedder, I bein a beggar, ef I mounted it I shoodent
                  ride to de devil. When I turned agin Massa, and went into de servis, I wuz
                  promised ef I behabed like a man I shood be counted a man. I behabed like a man,
                  but wat now? Dar's de cibbel rites bill, which reads good, but wha's de sogers to
                  put it froo? Dar's all sorts ob laws, but wha's de yoose ob em so long ez noboddy
                  pays any tenshun to em? I go Norf, wha de Ablishnists hab eberyting dah own way,
                  and I find de niggah is ez bad off dah ez he is heah, coz de Ablishnis, wich is de
                  champions uv ekal rites, ain't eddicated up to de pint uv bustin unekal laws. We
                  can't stay heah and git our rites—we can't go dah, coz ebry wun ob em will tell
                  yoo his nabor ain't eddicated up to de pint ob doin anything but holdin de
                  offises, and passin resolooshens dat dey bleeve in de principles ob de Declarashen
                  ob Independence, wich principles reed bery well, but wat good is dey to me ef dey
                  ain't acted up to? Fo' fo'pence I'd go hang myself."</p>
               <p>They had other talk, and finally broke up, endin with a prayer, the burden uv wich
                  wuz that the<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7103-00000034"/> good Lord wood find some
                  way, wat they didn't care, to eddicate their friends North up to the pint.</p>
               <p>Ez soon ez they wuz gone the Deekin and I crawled out from under the wagon, and I
                  must say the old gentleman surprised me. Dashin his hat down on the ground, he
                  execooted one uv the most frantic Highland flings my eyes ever witnist. It
                  astonished me to see how recklis the old man wuz with his legs. Finally, out uv
                  breath, he subsided with a prolonged shreek uv exultant joy.</p>
               <p>"Why so jubilant, my venerable friend?" sed I.</p>
               <p>"Nasby," sed he, "it's better than I hoped for. The Ablishnists bar em out—they
                  ain't eddikated up to the pint, and they drive em away. They make distinkshuns,
                  and when the nigger's distinkted aginst in part, he's precisely the material uv
                  which to make a servant unto his brethren. Ef the nigger can't git all his rites
                  in the North, he'd better be without any uv em in the South. Up ther he hez all
                  the cussitood uv bein a free man, without any uv the indoosements; down here, ef
                  he ain't got any uv the blessins uv freedom he ain't any uv the responsibilities.
                  The nigger, uv course, will stay—he'd be a cussed fool ef he didn't. Bless the
                  Lord for the Ablishnists wat ain't eddikated up to the pint!"</p>
               <p>And the blessed old lunatic execooted another Highland fling onto his hat. Sharin
                  his enthoosiasm, ez I alluz do everybody's I meet, that I may share whatever else
                  they hev, we went to Bascom's, wher, before we separated, we wuz eddikated up to a
                  pint, and considerable more. Bascom carried the Deekin home on a wheelbarrer, at a
                  little past one.</p>

                  Decisions of Squire Gavitt.</head>
               <opener>
                  <dateline>POST OFFIS, CONFEDRIT X ROADS (Wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),
                     Janooary 28, 1867.</dateline>
               </opener>
               <p>WUN uv the most important cases—important in a national sense—ever tried afore a
                  court uv justis, came off afore Squire Gavitt at the court-house, at the Corners
                  yesterday. It was important, becoz it involved the very eggistence uv the
                  institution upon wich Kentucky is built—becoz, upon its decision hung the question
                  whether or not the Bible shood be respectid and its holy injunctions
                  obeyed—whether Kentucky shood, clingin to the Skripters, go on ez a Christian
                  State, or denyin it, go back into infidelity and barbarism. I scasely need say
                  that the porshens uv the Bible to wich I refer, is the ever blessid chapters
                  relatin to Ham, Hager, and Onesimus—the only parts of the Skripter ter we pay much
                  attention to. But ef them is attacked successfully, wat follows? The entire
                  strukter comes tumblin to the ground. Therefore, holdin to Aferkin slavery, we are
                  orthodox believers.</p>
               <p>The circumstances uv the case wuz suthin like this: A nigger uv the name uv
                  Gabriel, wunst the happy and contented servant uv that eminent Christian, Deekin
                  Pogram, becum possessed uv the spirit uv the devil, and sullen, becoz the Deekin
                  sold his wife to raise the means to send his second son, Isaker, wich wuz a
                  studyin for the ministry, to a Theolojikle Institoot, somewheres in Georgia; and
                  also enraged becoz his female offspring, Elizer, happenin to attrack the attenshun
                  uv his eldest son, Elijer, he run away in the fust year uv the war, and follered
                  the Federal army, finally enlisting as a sojer. Durin the progress uv the
                  struggle, he learned to read, and bein powerful in prayer and sich, he headed a
                  revival, and hevin gifts that way, attracted the notis uv Genril Howard, or some
                  uv them fanatics, who hed him instructed, and finally made him an agent uv a
                  branch uv that accursid Freedmen's Burow; and sure enuff, after the war, he
                  appeared in this vicinity, salaried by the society, and commenst unfittin the
                  niggers for their normal condishun by teechin on em to read, and establishin<pb
                     n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7103-00000036"/> Sunday skools among em, and givin em
                  advice generally, wich wuz aginst the dignity and peace uv the commonwealth. The
                  citizens stood it with the pashense carakteristik uv the people uv Kentucky ontil
                  last Monday. The Deekin hed a dispoot with a nigger relativ to a triflin matter uv
                  wages. The nigger hed bin workin at the stipulated price uv $4 per month—the
                  Deekin brought in, ez a offset, his board at $2 per week; and ruther than hev any
                  fuss about it, proposed to let him work the balance out durin the winter months.
                  To this ekitable arrangement the nigger demurred, holdin that board wuz inclooded,
                  and this Gabrel advised the nigger to sue, and he did so.</p>
               <p>Enraged at his interference, the Deekin went before Square Gavitt, and complained
                  of Gabrel ez a vagrant, and employed me to attend to the case. Pollock, the
                  Illinoy storekeeper, volunteered to defend the nigger, and there wuz a tremenjus
                  eggsitement over it.</p>
               <p>I opened the case by stating that the nigger's biznis wuz to prove that he hed
                  vizable means uv support: Pollock insisted that it wuz our biznis to prove that he
                  hedn't, but the court decided agin him.</p>
               <p>The nigger then swore that he reseeved from his congregashen $30 per month for
                  services. I submitted that, ez he wuz a interested party, other proof wood be
                  required. Pollock interdoost the elders of the congregashen, but I checkmated him
                  there, by submittin that the testimony uv niggers wuzn't admissable, wich the
                  court decided it wuzn't.</p>
               <p>Immejitly Pollock submitted that whether or no his client coodent be considered a
                  vagrant, ez he cood testify himself to the fact that he (Gabrel) hed in his house
                  $200 in greenbax—a suffishent support for a time, at least.</p>
               <p>Ther wuz a immense eggscitement in the court.</p>
               <p>"Wher duz he keep it?" asked the Squire, visibly agitated.</p>
               <p>"In his chist at the house wher he boards," sed Pollock.</p>
               <p>"This court stands adjourned for thirty minits," sed the Squire, boundin over the
                  railin in front uv him. "Hold on," sez he; "hold on, Deekin; a fair start is all I
                  want. Don't take advantage uv my age to get ther first," and pell-mell over one
                  another the entire audience, ceptin Pollock, the nigger, and me, started on a keen
                  run for the house. In a few minits they returned, pantin and out uv breath, when
                  the Squire called the court to order agin, wich bein restored, he remarked,—</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7103-00000037"/>
               <p>Ef it cood be established that the nigger hed $200 in greenbax it wood
                  nessessarily discharge him, ez no man with that sum cood be considered a vagrant;
                  but he thot ef the prizner at the bar shood look in the direckshun uv his house,
                  he'd find it wuzn't ther any more, ez a house, the materyal uv wich it wuz built
                  wuz lyin permiskus. Likewise, probably, he wooodn't be able to find the $200 he
                  hed in his chist. The place that knowd it wunst will know it no more forever—it
                  hed been confiscated by the enraged citizens. He wantid it understood that no such
                  triflin impediment in the way uv justis ez the possession uv $200 cood be allowed
                  within the jurisdickshen uv this court. The nigger not bein able to prove his
                  means uv support, and ez the court knowed uv its own knollege that he ain't now
                  got any $200, the court wood ask the criminal's counsel wat other nonsense he hez
                  to plead.</p>
               <p>Sed Pollock, the Illinoy storekeeper,—</p>
               <p>"I wood beg leave to state to this court that, under the Civil Rites law, the
                  defendant cannot be arrested ez a vagrant, ez the law under wich the accused is
                  arrested only menshuns persons uv color, makin a distinkshen agin em."</p>

                  Filled with a sense uv the responsibility restin onto him, the Squire rose slowly
                  from his seat, his face uv a deathly palenis, wich hed the effeck uv highthin, by
                  contrast, the intense rednis uv his nose, and risin to his full hite, remarked
                  that the court hed expectid that objeckshen to be urged, and hed, therfore,
                  prepared fur it. That law doesn't bind this court to any alarmin extent,
                  considerin it ez infringin onto the reserved rites uv the States.</p>
               <p>"Will the court be so good ez to menshun for the informashun uv the populace, wat
                  the reserved rites uv the States are?" sez Pollock.</p>
               <p>"The court insists that it shel not be interruptid when it's deliverin itself uv
                  an opinion. Considerin it ez infringin upon the reserved rites uv the States, uv
                  whom Kentucky is the cheefest and the loveliest among ten thousand"—at this pint
                  his nose glowd redder, and it seemed to me ez tho a halo uv lite encirkled his
                  frosty head, ez he fearlessly continued—"the court holds that law to be
                  unconstooshnel, and ez sich, shel not regard it. Hez the counsel anythin more to
                  remark?"</p>
               <p>"Nothin," sed Pollock. "And knowin the court so well ez I do, I wonder at my makin
                  sich an ass uv myself ez to hev remarkt anything at all."</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7103-00000038"/>
               <p>"Hez the counsel for the State anything to say?"</p>
               <p>"Nothin," sed I. "I am willin to trust the case in yoor hands, feelin confident
                  that justis—genooine Kentucky justis—will be done."</p>
               <p>Wareupon the Squire hed the prizner stand up, and, drawin on a black cap, in a
                  very impressive manner, sentenst him to eighteen months hard labor, breakin stone
                  for the turnpike, wich we are buildin from the Corners to the stashen, at the
                  conklushen uv wich Pollock very profanely added, "And may the Lord hev mercy on
                  your sole."</p>
               <p>The nigger wuz immejitly stript uv his good close, wich the Squire thot wood just
                  fit him, and a soot uv vagrant's close wuz given him, and he wuz to-wunst put to

               <p>IT wuz a crooel necessity, after all, wich druv me into the servis uv His
                  Eggslency A. Johnson. Crooel, I say; for whenever he hez a partikelerly mean piece
                  uv work to perform, suthin so inexpressibly sneakin that Seward nor Randall won't
                  undertake it, they alluz send for me. Welles is alluz willin; but while he hez the
                  disposishen to do anything in the line, he lax the ability. The uthers, however,
                  hev the ability to do anythin and the disposishen to do most things, and therfore
                  I hev bin employed in only eggstreme cases.</p>
               <p>The success wich attended McCracken's mishun, endin ez it did in the resinin uv
                  Motley, stimyoolated<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7103-00000039"/> lated Seward to

                  offisers regardin him, and his, ez well ez my sooperior, A. Johnson. Randall wuz
                  applied to to take a tour among Post Masters and sich. He declined the mishen
                  indignantly, with the remark, "Is thy servant a dog, or the son uv a dog, that he
                  shood do this thing?" And ez Welles isn't trusted out uv Washinton any more, I wuz
                  sent for.</p>
               <p>The biznis required uv me wuz statid by Seward in his yoosual loocid style. It wuz
                  merely to cirkelate <foreign xml:lang="LAT">incognito</foreign> (wich is Latin for
                  sneakin) among the recently appinted offis-holders, and assertain ther views upon
                  general politikle topics, but more espeshally ther feelins toward the President
                  and Sekretary uv State. Jest ez I wuz startin, not at all pleased with the mishen,
                  Welles put in his oar. He wuz agoin to give me instrucshuns ez to wat I wuz to do.
                  Welles is a lunatik I never cood abide, and I felt it my dooty to wither him.
                  Transfixin the venerable Sekretary with wun uv my most piercenist gazes, I
                  remarked,—"Sir! in imitashen uv the man who inflicted yoo upon this country, wich
                  wuz not the least uv his acts for wich the country cusses him, I propose relatin a
                  little anecdote. Ther wuz wunst a man who wuz inebriatid; and that he might
                  present hisself in a state approximatin sobriety to the pardner uv his buzzum, he
                  wuz essayin to vomit, tryin thus to ease his stumick uv the cause uv the
                  onpleasantnis therin; but he coodent do it. He heaved and heaved, but there wuz no
                  result. At this critikle period another man approacht, who remarked, kindly, that
                  ef he desired to vomit, his best holt wood be to run his finger down his throat.
                  The drunk individooal looked up indignant at this unwarranted interference with
                  his constooshnel rites. 'Blast yoor eyes, sir,' sed he, 'are yoo or me bossin this
                  yer puke?'</p>
               <p>"This, Sekretary Welles, is the anecdote. I respeck the posishun yoo hold, and
                  dislike sayin anythin disagreeable; but, sir, this <emph>is</emph> a puke, and I
                  perpose to boss it myself."</p>
               <p>I startid to-wunst, and found things in a highly mixed condition. The followin is
                  compiled from my reports: In Noo York the Postmasters generally are sound. The
                  crops wer poor last year; and all kinds uv biznis bein dull, the Postmasters are
                  generally anxious to hold on. They are, therefore, out-spoken in their support uv
                  the coz. Them ez wuz men uv good standin and relijusly inklined, before the
                  rupcher between the President and the party wich redoost him, say but very little
                  in publick,<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7103-00000040"/> and that little they don't
                  say very long. They generally can't see that ther is any partikeler differense
                  between the President's plan and the plan uv Congress, and ther bein so little,
                  Congress ought to yeeld for the sake uv peace. The Dimokrats, holdin sich places,
                  are loud enough in support uv the Administrashen; but, good Heaven! the
                  endorsement uv sich men is too heavy a load for any party to carry. Now, that I
                  think uv it, I hev at last solved the mystery uv our wide-spread defeat last fall.
                  In some deestricks the Dimocrisy found Johnson too heavy a load to carry, and in
                  the balance the Johnson men found the Dimokrisy too heavy a load to carry.</p>
               <p>In Ohio, the first place I stopt at wuz Oberlin, the place where the nigger
                  college is located at. I regret to say that the Postmaster at that pint is a
                  rantin Ablishnist; and in the two hours I wuz ther, I coodent find a Conservative
                  Republikin who wood take it. I got one nearly perswadid; but jest ez he wuz about
                  to consent, his wife fell a weepin onto his buzzum, and with tetchin pathos wantid
                  to kno ef he wuz willin, for sich small pay, to leave sich a tarnisht name to the
                  four children now born to em and the wun wich wuz expectid? He repentid and
                  refoosed. I didn't investigate ez fully ez I might, for ther ain't a drop uv
                  likker sold ther; and ez my flask give out, I felt that doo considerashen for my
                  health woodent permit my stayin another hour. I recommend the abolishen uv the
                  office, or the establishment uv a grosery, with a bar in the back room, ez a
                  nukleus around wich the Dimocrisy kin rally.</p>
               <p>The next place I cum to I found the Postmaster a suspishus caracter—very
                  suspishus. Whenever he is drunk he speaks very highly uv the Sekretary uv State,
                  but when sober he avoids politikle matters. I sejest a raise in the salary uv the
                  offis, that he kin afford to keep drunk all the time.</p>
               <p>At the next pint I interdoost myself ez a English nobleman in disguise, studyin
                  Amerikin manners and customs, and menshund carelessly that I hed bin to Washinton,
                  and hed bin presentid to the President and Sekretary uv State. The Postmaster wuz
                  vizably affectid. Glacin furtively around to see that no one wuz lookin, he
                  remarked in a low tone: "My deer sir, don't, I beg uv yoo, form yoor idea uv the
                  public men uv Ameriky from them specimens. Don't, I beg. The first, sir, is a
                  accident—sich a man cood never hev bin made on purpose. The second wuz suthin, in
                  his earlier years; but now, sir, now—he's a degradid old man," and he busted into
                  tears. "Bein determind to hold onto his place, he tried at fust to bring the
                  President, by<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7103-00000041"/> accident, up to his level;
                  but that bein impossible, he deliberately let hisself down to the level uv the
                  President, and the distance, sir, wuz so great, the Sekretary bein suthin, that
                  the shock, sir, undoubtedly knockt his intelleck out uv him, for he ain't
                  displayed any since. He literally fell among thieves. May the Lord forgive Willyum
                  H. Seward for the shipwreck he made uv his reputashen, for—"</p>
               <p>At this pint the poor man stopt. I happened to pull out my hankercher, and in doin

               <p>I leave the case in the hands uv the Cabinet. It's aggravatin.</p>
               <p>Another man openly defied me. He wantid me to take the offis off uv his hands. His
                  children, he sed, wuz made mouths at and skoffed at, at skool, becoz ther father,
                  wich hed bin a Republikin, held a Fedral offis, and his wife wuz defeeted for
                  President uv the Sewin Sosiety, a posishen she hed alluz held, on the same
                  akkount. He hed stood it long enuff. Ef he coodent git it off his hands, he'd
                  commit sooicide, and by thus puttin hisself out uv the way make his abuzed family
                  the only reparashen in his power. I sejest that he be removed. Sich talk may be
                  safely set down ez incendiary.</p>
               <p>Another hed the highest possible opinion uv the President, and worshipt the
                  Secretary. He considered his plan uv reconstruction the best wich cood hev bin
                  devised by mortal wisdom. He hed vainly striven to git a nominashen for an offis
                  from the Republikin party for years, but failed, owin to a lack uv confidence. He
                  wood have jined the Democracy; but ez they wuz hopelessly in the minority, it
                  woodent hev helped him. He considered Johnson's idea uv fillin the offisis with
                  Republikins bully, ther bein so few uv that persuasion who'd take em, and he
                  didn't want any accessions to the party.</p>
               <p>Ther wuz now jist enuff to hold the offisis in control uv the President, and them
                  wuz all the offisis they cood git any how. I sejest that he be continyood. He
                  isn't discreet; but we can't expect all the virchoos at so small a price. None uv
                  us is perfeck—I spose I hev my failins.</p>

               <p>THE Institoot is, I may say, a success. Contribushens flow in slowly but
                  shoorly,—fast enuff indeed to give each uv the Board a noo soot uv close; and we,
                  speshelly, who hev the fust handlin uv that money, sevral other comforts. But that
                  corner-stun troubles us. Sum hundreds uv people saw that a bottle uv likker and a
                  greenback wuz deposited under it, and regerly every nite it's bin overturned by
                  persons in serch uv them relics. At great expense we built onto it a section uv
                  wall; but makin no account uv our expenditoor, they overturned it. We then histed
                  a sign-board bearing this<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7103-00000043"/> legend: "The
                  whisky is gone, and the greenback also," signed by the Board; but one half uv the
                  citizens uv that lokality don't read, and tother didn't hev the nessary confidence
                  in the truthfulness uv the Board to prevent em from goin for the artikles, tho the
                  very knowlege uv us wich brot about this state uv disbelief, shood, wun wood

                  after so long a period hed ensood. So, ez a last resort, we stuck two posts in the
                  ground and drawd an iron chain over it. That got em. Force is about the only thing
                  uv any account in this country.</p>
               <p>The Board met last nite at the Post Offis, wich, ontil we git the Institoot built,
                  will be the headquarters uv the Trustees, to consider the propriety uv publishin a
                  series uv skool books, adaptid especially to the Southern intelleck, and
                  calculated partikelarly to keep alive in the minds uv the buddin yooths uv the
                  late Confederacy, wich is unfortunately deceest, a lively opinion uv themselves
                  and a corresponding hatred uv Noo England and the North generally. We hev had
                  serious doubts whether proper ideas cood be instilled into a yooth from a book
                  written by a Boston man, and printed in Cincinnati, onto paper made in Noo
                  York.</p>
               <p>I submitted to the Board a example for a noo Arithmetic, to wit:—</p>

                  onto him two counterfeit ten dollar notes. To make up the expenditoor, he to-wunst
                  swindles a innocent Kentuckian out uv $100 in a patent rite, a Alabamian out uv
                  $200 in a western land trade, and the balance he makes up by sellin wooden
                  nutmegs, wich he turns out uv basswood at a profit uv 4 cents per one. The grate
                  moral question is, how many nutmegs must this ingenius but unprincipled cuss
                  manufaktur, and how long does it take him, with the improoved machinery, they hev
                  to do it?</p>
               <p>"The Southern soljers, at the battle uv the first Bull Run, captured 18 Federals,
                  one uv whom hed upon his person $12 in greenbax, and tothers $8 each. How many uv
                  Johnson's Postmasters cood be bought with the proceeds uv the capcher?"</p>
               <p>Deekin Pogram approved uv these examples; but he kept insistin that there wuzn't
                  enuff in em to fire the Southern heart. The Southern heart wuz a perpetooal
                  funeral pile wich needid continyooal firin. Onless fired it wuz a gloomy mass uv
                  very onsightly black cinders. He proposed that the forthcoming book shood be coal
                  oil on the slumberin embers uv the yoothful Southern heart. He hed a example:—</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7103-00000044"/>
               <p>"The battle uv Chickamauga wuz fought a certain number uv miles from Chattanooga.
                  One regiment uv Confedrit soljers druv a division uv Fedral mercenaries into the
                  town. Allowin that each Fedral, ez well ez Confedrit, hed two legs, how many more
                  steps did the Fedrals take to get em into Chattanooga, where they wuz
                  comparatively safe from Confedrit rage and valor, and sich, than it did the
                  Confedrits to drive em thar?"</p>
               <p>Bascom remarkt that he hed one wich he felt it his dooty to perpose:—</p>
               <p>"A strikly conscienshus grosery keeper starts in biznis worth four hundred dollars
                  in clean cash. He pays for his whiskey two dollars per gallon in Looisville, and
                  hez for a reglar customer a Postmaster, wich drinks forty or sixty times per day,
                  and alluz tells him to 'jist chalk it down.' Required the length uv time nessary
                  to bust him under them afflictin circumstances?"</p>
               <p>Bascom remarkt that long before the book appears in print, he wood be able to
                  furnish the anser to that little problem. Considerin the example a dig direct at
                  me, I wuz uv a noshen to retort; but ther wuz sich a look uv injerd innosense onto
                  Bascom's countenance that reely I coodent. Suthin must be done for Bascom,—I hev
                  lived onter him too long. The next contribushen I reseeve from frends North shel
                  be devoted to liquidating, in part, the debt I owe him. I cood bust him, by not
                  givin him at least cost for his likker; but wat follows? There's the rub. Wood he
                  who come after give me credit? Better bear the ills we hev than fly to them to
                  wich we hevn't bin interdoost.</p>
               <p>Joe Bigler, the drunken Confedrit soljer, happened in, and heard the last two
                  examples, and remarkt that he cood furnish us any number uv examples at site. We
                  never stop Joseph in anythin he perposes to do, for he hez a habit uv carryin a
                  navy revolver slung to him, and he shoots. Joseph wuz, therfore, permitted to
                  perceed.</p>
               <p>"Ef a Southern man pants for his rites, and fites four years for em, gittin licked
                  like the devil, how long after is it advisable for him to continyoo to pant,
                  pervidid he didn't know at the beginnin wat his rites wuz?"</p>
               <p>I vencherd to remark that a solution uv that problem wuz impossible, thar bein no
                  pint to work a departure from, to wich Joseph remarkt that perhaps it wuz faulty
                  in that partikeler; but he hed others:—</p>
               <p>"Ef a Southern soljer kin whip five Northern soljers, why in bloody thunder, they
                  hevin hed a<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7103-00000045"/> suffishency uv opportoonities
                  uv doin it, didn't the South gain her independence?</p>
               <p>"Ef fitin four years, and loosin every doggoned cent's worth uv property a man hed
                  wuz profitable biznis, how many struggles for independence wood a man uv modrit
                  means be justified in goin thru with?</p>
               <p>"Ef two gallons and a half uv Kentucky whisky kin be got from a bushel uv corn,
                  how many Democratic voters, takin young men ez they run, kin be manufaktured from
                  the produck uv an aker uv good land in a modrit year for corn?</p>
               <p>"A high-toned shivelrous Virginian, twenty years ago, hed a female slave wich wuz
                  ez black ez a crow, and worth only $800. Her progeny wuz only half ez black ez a
                  crow, and her female grandchildren wuz suffishently bleached to sell in Noo
                  Orleans for $2,500 per female offspring. Required, 1st. The length uv time nessary
                  to pay off the Nashnel debt by this means. 2d. The number uv years nessary to
                  bleach the cuss of color out uv the niggers uv the United States.</p>
               <p>"Ef four old gray-headed jackasses, wich ought to know better, see fit to keep one
                  sucker filled with whisky, how many suckers cood four iron-gray mules keep filled,
                  they bein only half jackass?</p>
               <p>"A. Johnson hed the idea uv carryin a certin number uv deestricks, by speekin in
                  em with Seward, all uv wich gave increased majorities agin him. Required the
                  number uv miles uv travel, and the number uv repetitions uv the speech, to enable
                  him to carry out his policy?</p>
               <p>"Ef two nips at Washinton wuz suffishent to perdoose the speech at the
                  inaugerashen on the 4th uv March, 1865, how many must have bin slung into A. J. to
                  perdoose the 22d uv Febrooary effort, and how many must he hev taken between
                  Washinton and St. Louis?"</p>
               <p>"These examples," sed Joseph, "I consider nessary for this book; and ef it is
                  published without em I shel take it ez a persnel affront, for which I shel hold
                  the Board persnelly responsible. The Southern yooth must be properly instructed—my
                  orphans must hev proper notions instilled into em, and these examples is necessary
                  to that end. Let this Board remember that, when this book is publisht, ef these
                  examples is not in them, they hev me to settle with."</p>
               <p>And Joseph departed. We are in a quandary. We dare not publish the book without
                  his examples, for he alluz keeps his word, and is a ugly cuss to deal with; and uv
                  course puttin em in coodent be<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7103-00000046"/> thought
                  uv. We finally decided that Joseph must be got out uv the way ez soon ez possible,
                  and therefore votid that Bascom give him unlimited credit at his bar for a week,
                  chargin the same upon the account uv the Institoot. I know that a free run at his
                  barrels would finish me or any one uv the Board in that time. Happy Bigler! He hez
                  at least one satisfactry week afore him,—I cood almost wish the Board wood try it
                  on me. It would be a short but glorious career.</p>

               <p>WASHINGTON agin! What changes hev been made in the last two years! Not in
                  Washington, for this deliteful abode uv official purity hezn't changed a particle,
                  nor never will. From the summit uv Willard's Hotel I kin see now, ez I did a year
                  ago, the same signs uv "steamed oysters;" the Capitle, in front, towrin over the
                  trees at the tother end uv the avenue, and behind, the Patent Offis and Post Offis
                  buildings; the first the Mecca uv every Dimokrat and the tother uv every Yankee
                  who comes here. No! Washington ain't changed, but I hev. Formerly, when I visited
                  Washington, it wuz tite times with me. Willard's wuz my hotel then ez now.
                  Chadwick, him uv the towerin hite, rotund abdomen, side whiskers, and round hat,
                     wuz<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7103-00000047"/> then, ez now, my landlord. In them
                  days, before the happy return uv A. Johnson to reason put some thousands uv
                  Democrats, who hed more stumic than money, and more appetite than small change,
                  into offis, and, per consekence, into condition to pay their bills, I wuz a guest
                  at this hotel; which is to say, I slept on the steps uv the Capitol, and took, or
                  tried to take, my meals at Chadwick's bountiful board. Ef I hed no currency, I hed
                  taste; and ez I wuz foragin for subsistence, I allus made it a pint to forage on
                  the richest paster fields. It's ez easy to cheek a first class dinner ez it is a
                  second class; and besides, I felt that sich a hotel ez Willard's wuz better able
                  to stand sich boarders ez I wuz than them of less patronage. I kept away from the
                  tother hotels out of sympathy for the proprietors. Never shel I forget my last
                  visit here. I hed run the dinin-room guardian angel for a week, and wuz
                  congratulatin myself on another week at least, when Chadwick stopped me hisself,
                  and the follerin conversashen ensood:—</p>
               <p>"My friend," sed he, in winnin tones.</p>
               <p>"Davis, Garret, is my name!" sez I, promptly.</p>
               <p>"We hear enuff," sez he. "Listen! I've let you run a week, coz it's my regler
                  practis. Yoo hed a hungry look, but by this time yoo ought to be filled up and
                  able to go at least a week without eatin. Ez yoo ain't uv no earthly yoose to any
                  body, and make no pretensions to bein ornamental—Git!" and three well-directed
                  kicks landid me onto the sidewalk.</p>
               <p>But I hev forgiven him. He treats me well. He hes confidence in me now, ez I hev
                  paid my board in advance. It's a rool he hez, he jocosely remarked, with men of my
                  peculiar cast uv countenance, to hev em pay in advance. He says it's much the best
                  way. After payin, sich men ez me feel more comfortable about the house, and so do
                  the proprietors. It's me that is changed,—I hev money to pay my bills. Bless the
                  Lord for Seward, Johnson, Randall, and other luxuries!</p>
               <p>But pleasant ez it is to contrast my former posishen with my present proud one, I
                  hev not time to dwell upon reminiscences. Life is short; I am a practical man, and
                  tho it may be pleasant to linger for a moment onto memry's pleasant fields, I
                  cannot. My biznis in Washington is precisely what every Democrat's biznis here is,
                  to get confirmed. It ain't no trouble for a Kentucky Dimocrat to git appintid, for
                  the President hez so far relaxed his rules in this pertikeler ez to appint them ez
                  wuzn't never in the Confederit army; but to get confirmed<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000048"/> is the pinch. There's the gauntlet uv a Ablishen
                  Senit to run; and good Lord, wat a knowledge they hev uv the out-goins and
                  in-comins of the appintees!</p>
               <p>The President and Postmaster-General Randall wuz extremely anxious for my
                  confirmashen, so much so, that they advised me to resort to the strategy now so
                  common in the North.</p>
               <p>"Go back on me for the time bein," sed that trooly great and good man who adorns
                  the sofas in the Presidenshul Manshen. "Wilcox em. That's yoor only holt: Wilcox
                  em. I advised him to do it, and see how it worked."</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," sed I, carried away by this new and onexpected development uv
                  greatness, "kin yoo bear to hev me who bears yoor banner in Kentucky bend the knee
                  to a ablishen Senit, and repoodiate yoo, even for a hour? It is safe in my case,
                  for my nateral affinities are with yoo, but don't, I beg uv yoo, advise all uv em
                  to do so. My deer sir, two thirds uv em will go out for confirmashen, and, ef
                  successful, will forgit to return."</p>
               <p>But the great and good Johnson wood take no denials. "Draw up," sed he, "a letter
                  to a conservative member uv Congress, explainin your connection with me, and—"</p>
               <p>And overkum with emoshen, he burst into tears.</p>

                              State uv Kentucky, being somewhat jeopardized by my operashuns in the
                              politikle field doorin the past two years, I hev the honor to explane

                              the war I took up arms for the preservashen uv our beloved Yoonion.
                              The precise date I cannot give, owin to the demoralized condishen uv
                              my mind at the time; but that yoo kan assertane for yoor-selves. It
                              wuz about two weeks after the fust draft. That I laid down arms agin
                              ez soon ez the regiment struck Southern sile will not, when the
                              motives wich actooated me are known, be allowed to weigh agin me. It

                              but history subsekently vindicated him; he went to ketch Arnold. I
                              will not stop to reply to my defamers; but ef it comes out finally
                              that I went for the purpose uv satisfyin rebels by okular

                           <p>"I do not deny that I wuz a ardent supporter uv President Johnson from
                              the beginning uv his career. I wuz filled with a drafted man's
                              magninimity toward a conkered foe, and up to the very day I reserved
                              my commishen I favored consilatory measures. I accompanied him on
                              his—I will not say disgraceful, for he is my sooperior officer—tour
                              thru the Northern States, and slung my hat higher nor anybody else's
                              at his—I will not say drunken, for reasons above mentioned—speeches,
                              and aboozed the highly intelligent populaces at Cleveland,
                              Injeanapolis, Springfield, and other pints, in a manner wich, now that
                              I think uv it, wuz trooly shameful. Also, I organized the Postmasters
                              uv various Northern States into a Johnson party, and vigorously
                              supported members uv Congress pledged to the policy uv wich I wuz, at
                              the time, a deceeved supporter. About this time I wuz appointed
                              Postmaster; and, findin I needed confirmashen, my views undergoed a
                              radical change. Time and observashen hev taught me that instid of
                              consiliashen, coershen is our best holt; and that now military
                              measures are necessary in the South ontil them rebellyus people
                              completely acquiesce in terms imposed by Congris for restorashen shen.
                              My views on this interestin topic is best defined by the recent
                              speeches uv Hon. Charles Sumner, the eminent and trooly great Senator
                              from the enlitened State uv Massachusetts, and also by the recent
                              utterances uv them lovable Representatives, Hon. Thadeus Stevens, of
                              Pennsylvania, Hon. &amp; Gen. Benj. F. Butler, uv Massachoosetts, and
                              Hon. James M. Ashley, uv Ohio, in all uv whose sentiments, sich as
                              they hev now, and also them ez they hev alluz hed, as well ez them
                              which they may hereafter hev, I most heartily and entirely concur.</p>
                           <p>"With this explanation, wich I hope will prove entirely satisfactory,
                              and with the addishnel asshoorence that I am now a very warm supporter
                              of the Congressional policy, and that when I look back and see what I

                  took from the Republican ranks, but not for me. I hev done many things wich
                  perhaps woodn't hold out sixty pounds to the bushel—I voted for Peerce and
                  likewise for Bookannon, and supported em in all their various dooins, besides
                  other things too tejus to menshun; but my sensitive soul recoils at this,—my proud
                  stumick revolts. I leave it for yoor Custers and Wilcoxes and sich,—no Kentucky

                  Kentucky, wich never seceded, uv mail facilities."</p>
               <p>"Brave man!" exclaimed Johnson, in a husky voice, and his eyes suffused with
                  tears, fallin onto my neck and weepin profoosely down my back, "let em reject yoo.
                  Ef they do, I pledge yoo my word, and will give yoo sekoority now if yoo desire

               <p>BACKERD, turn backerd, O Time in yoor flite," is the fust line uv a song wich I
                  heerd not long since. Wood that Time cood perform that back ackshen feat, and get
                  us all back wher we wuz six years ago. But Time can't. Time is a perpetooal
                  moshen, wich must go on, and on, and wich can't never retrace her steps.</p>
               <p>The situashen ain't pertickelerly agreeable jist now. It hezn't a joocy look, nor
                  does it promise an improvement in the future. The confidence uv the Dimocrisy uv
                  Kentucky is shaken to the extent that it's lost its equilibrium and totters to its
                  centre. When it falls, I shel be found under the rooins.</p>
               <p>The passage of the Military Law may be sed to be the last feather wich reely ought
                  to break the Kentucky camel's back. It's the deepest and finishnest stab at
                  constooshnel liberty and ekal rites, inezmuch ez it not only blasts forever the
                  hopes uv re-establishin slavery, but gives the nigger all the rites and privileges
                  enjoyed by white men. We, who are chiefly interested, are not to be consulted in
                  the matter. Fedral hirelins, whose very presence is pizen to the people uv these
                  States, are to be quartered onto us to see that "justis"—wat holler mockry!—is
                  done to em. The governments established by Androo Johnson is overturned ef they
                  don't play the fiddle to military satraps, and accept the Constooshnel Amendment,
                  wich perhibits them who wuz our champions in the late effort to destroy a
                  government wich we hatid, from takin hold uv it agin and runnin it. Wuz ther ever
                  sich a mixter uv injustis and perscripshen? Wuz ther ever sich severity? Wuz ther
                  ever sich a lack uv magnanimity? And all this time where is Johnson? He vetoed
                  these bills,—but wherefore? He knowd that the Rump Congress hed a majority uv two
                  thirds, and cood pass em over his veto; why, then, when they set his authority at
                  defiance, didn't he rise in his might and disperse em? Where, too, wuz the<pb
                     n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7103-00000052"/> Dimocrisy uv the North? Where are they
                  in this crisis, when our dearest rites—their greatest care—is bein shiprecked on
                  the iron-bound rocks uv despotism? Where are they, I say? Why don't they rally, ez
                  they threatened, and demand that Johnson shel hurl them levelers from their
                  usurped seats, and restore peace, on sich terms ez we shall consider ekitable, to
                  this wunst happy, but now distracted, country. Alas! they hevn't time. I see them
                  who breathed so much vengence and slawtrins afore Johnson hed offices to dispose
                  uv, a neglectin us, and a runnin about gittin signatoors to applicashens for Post
                  Offises, and hollerin to us ez they ketch their breath, "Accept, the
                  condishens—git back into the Yoonion, that we may elect the President in 1868,
                  who'll give us all the patronage!" Their noosepapers all shreek, "Accept, and get
                  back into the Yoonion, that we may elect the next President, who'll give us all
                  the patronage!" And that ain't the worst uv it. Them wich we bought up with
                  appintments diskivered on a sudden that a Abolition Senit hed to confirm em, and
                  to sekoor that they hev gone back onto us. Custer is a shinin example, Wilcox is
                  another, and I mite menshun hundreds uv others who hev slid back in the same
                  manner.</p>
               <p>Troy wuz taken by the strategy uv the Greeks, who exposed a wooden horse, in the
                  bowels uv wich wuz conceeled armed men, wich the verdant Troys pulled inside their
                  gates. Androo Johnson wuz the wooden horse wich wuz sent into our camp by the
                  Ablishnists, and the offices wuz the armed men in his bowels. They hev bin our
                  rooin. So long ez they wuz in the dim distance, the Democracy wuz hungry and
                  feroshus, and capable uv almost anythin—so soon ez they got em, they become quiet
                  ez lambs. The Postmaster who holds a commishn sez to himself, "Wherefore shel I
                  bust the Government under wich I hev a place? Kin I git another under the new
                  one?" and he yells to us, "Accept the terms!" We capchered the camp uv the enemy,
                  but are demoralized by the plunder we found. It's the old trick, over agin, these
                  offices, which the white men yoost to play onto the Injins, to wit:—evacuatin a
                  posishen and leavin a barrel uv whiskey behind, knowin that the Injin's instincts,
                  like them uv a Kentucky Dimokrat's, wood lead him to git blind drunk, and make him
                  a easy prey to the skelpin knife. The offisis wuz the whiskey wich intoxicated our
                  braves; and our skelps, so to speek, hang at the belts uv our enemies. Sumner hez
                  many, Thad Stevens hez many, and Butler is a gatherin uv em with a rapidity
                  wonderful to behold.</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7103-00000053"/>
               <p>But wat marks the demoralizashen uv the Dimocrisy the most, is the follerin
                  extract wich I cut from the Noo York World, wunst our trusted orgin. I hev not the
                  heart to re-write it. I paste the slip onto the paper; hence I am not responsible
                  for sich errors uv orthografy and grammer ez may be discovered into it. Here it
                  is:—</p>
               <p>"As regards the popular notion of the odor of the negro, it may be positively
                  stated that he, in this respect, is like the white,—a clean negro bein free from
                  it, and a foul one cursed by it."</p>
               <p>Ef this be troo—ef the nigger don't stink, then Noah got tite, and Ham wuz cust in
                  vane—then Paul sent back Onesimus for nothin, and Hager is uv no more interest to
                  the Dimocrisy than any other female who hez bin ded several thousand years. The
                  Dimocratic party wuz built upon this stink; and ef that corner-stun is knocked
                  out, the temple falls, and buries all beneath its rooins who are sheltered under
                  it, uv whom I am the cheefest and the loveliest among ten thousand.</p>
               <p>At one fell swoop the wind is knockt out uv the sales uv the Northern Dimocrisy.
                  Wat is the nigger now to them ef he does not stink? "Popler noshen," indeed!
                  Trooly it wuz a popler noshen. That stink led hundreds uv thousands uv Democrats
                  by the nose. That "odor"—ez the writer styles it—wuz our best holt, and wun wich
                  wuz everything to us. That stink wuz all that elevated the Demokrat over the
                  nigger—that wuz our mark of sooperiority. <emph>We</emph>, at times, wuz not uv
                  the precise odor uv Nite-bloomin serious. A Democratic mass convenshen, when in a
                  tite room, with two stoves in it, wuz not the most odorous gatherin in the world;
                  but we thanked God continyooally that the smell wich ariz ez the room got hot wuz
                  not the pecooliar aroma uv the nigger, and we wuz comforted. But this writer
                  redooses the whole thing—the whole difference between the nigger and a Democrat—to
                  a matter of color and cleanliness. Wat heresy! Wat iconaclasm! (this last word
                  meanin, I believe, idol breakin, or suthin uv that sort.) <emph>Ef this be troo,
                     then in the nite time, a nigger with his feet washed is better than a
                     Demokrat!</emph> For one, now I care not ef Dr. Cummins' "Last Warnin Cry" be
                  trooly the last. I'm sorry that he rented his house for ninety-nine years, ez it
                  hez a tendency to destroy my faith in his beleef that the world is about peggin
                  out. The sooner Gabrel blows his horn the better I shel be sooted.</p>
               <p>Here agin this matter uv state offisis comes in. The Dimocrisy uv Noo York see
                  that nigger suffrage<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7103-00000054"/> is inevitable, and
                  to sekoor their share uv it, they're biddin in time; forgettin that while they're
                  acheevin a temporary success on that side uv the cirkle we're losing all control
                  uv the niggers on this. Wat did the South ever care for Dimokratic successes,
                  'ceptin ez it bolstered up their niggers?</p>
               <p>I'm discouraged. I see afore me trouble. I see but one or two streeks uv lite on
                  my horizon. Ohio won't let her niggers vote no how, and sum other States are in
                  the same fix, and possibly this ackshen may be the sign uv returnin reason. Ohio
                  may, after all, be the rock agin wich the waves uv fanatakism may beet in vane,
                  and conservatism, gatherin strength there, may finally assert itself elsewhere.
                  May the Lord send it, for ef this thing goes on, I'm a lost and rooined man.</p>

               <p>I HEV made many sudden and rather 'strordinary changes in politix—some so very
                  sudden that the movement perdoost conjestion uv the conshence. I rekollect wunst
                  uv advokatin free trade and high protective tariff, all within twelve hours (I
                  made a speech in a agricultooral deestrik uv Noo York in the forenoon, at 10 A.
                  M., and in a manufacturin town in Pennsylvany in the evenin, our platform bein so

                  other feats uv moral gymnastiks; but this last change I hev bin called upon to
                  make is probably the suddenest. Last week Toosday, Deekin Pogram, Captain<pb

                  determined on standin it no longer. Selectin three, wich we wuz satisfied hed too
                  much spellin-book into em to be enslaved agin, we wuz preparin notises to be
                  served onto em, orderin em to leave in twenty-four hours, when I reseeved in the
                  northern mail a letter marked "Free—Alex. W. Randell, P. M. G." I knowd it wuz
                  offishel to-wunst—that blessid signatoor is on my commisshun, and I've
                  contemplatid it too often to be mistaken in it. Its contents wuz brief, and run
                  thus:—</p>
               <p>"To all Postmasters in the Southern States: The niggers hev votes—consiliashen is
                  our best holt. See to it."</p>
               <p>This breef, tho not hard to be understood order, wuz sealed with the offishel seal
                  uv the Post Offis Department, stampt into putty instid uv wax, to wit: a loaf of
                  bread, under a roll uv butter, with ten hands a grabbin at it. I comprehended the
                  situation at site, and set about doin my dooty with both Roman and Spartan
                  firmness. "Deekin," sez I, tearin up the notises, "these niggers we hev
                  misunderstood. They are not a inferior race—they are not descendants uv Ham and
                  Hager—it wuzn't Paul's idea in sendin back Onesimus to condemn him to servitood—we
                  hev misunderstood the situation, and must make amends. The nigger is devoid uv
                  smell, and is trooly a man and a brother!"</p>

                  lafft in my face, and askt me how long it wuz sence I hed helpt hang a couple uv
                  niggers, by way uv finishin off a celebrashen. Pollock, the Illinois storekeeper,
                  got hold uv it, and told Joe Bigler, and Joe swore that ef the niggers hedn't any
                  more sense than we give em credit for, in sposin we cood bamboozle em so cheep, he
                  shood go back to the old beleef, to wit: that they wuz only a sooperior race uv
                  monkeys, after all; and by nite every nigger in the visinity wuz postid
                  thoroughly, and out uv all uv em I cood only git four who would promise to attend,
                  and them the Deekin hed to pay $2 apiece to. To give<pb n="108-109"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000056"/> it eclaw I promised one uv em $5 (to be paid at the
                  close uv the meetin) to sit on the stand with me, wich, bein a very poor man, and
                  hevin a sick wife in a shanty near by, who wuz suffering for medicine (wich he
                  coodent git without money), he accepted.</p>
               <p>At this pint an idee struck me. I remembered Philadelfy, and determined to hev a
                  scene rivalin the Couch and Orr biznis. "Another thing, Cuff. Understand that it's
                  a part uv the bargain that when in my speech I turn to yoo and stomp, yoo must
                  rise and embrace me."</p>
               <p>"Wat?" sez he.</p>
               <p>"Fall into my arms, lovin-like—you understand—jist as tho we wuz long-lost
                  brothers!"</p>
               <p>"Scuse me!" sed he. "I'se a mity low nigger, and wants to buy de old woman some
                  quinine, and wood do most anything foah dat; but, golly, dat's too much!"</p>
               <p>"Not a cent," sed I, sternly, assoomin my most piercinest gaze; "onless this is
                  included!"</p>
               <p>"Well," returned he, sulkily, "ef I must, I speck I must; but, golly—"</p>
               <p>The nite arrived, and the meetin-house wuz full. We thot fust uv holding it in the
                  chapel uv the College, but give up the idea ez impracticable, ez, owin to the
                  dillytorinis uv our Northern friends in forwardin sich subscripshens ez they hev
                  raised, we hevent got no further with the bildin than layin the cornerstun. In the
                  front wuz the four niggers, all in clean shirts, and on the stand wuz the nigger I
                  hed engaged. Over the platform, wuz the follerin mottoes:—</p>
               <p>"In Yoonion ther is strength—For President in 1868, Fernando Wood. For Vice
                  President, Frederick Duglis."</p>
               <p>"In the nigger, strength—In the Caucashen, beauty—In the mulatter, who is trooly
                  the noblest uv the human species—both."</p>
               <p>In addishen to these, we dug up all the old mottoes wich Jefferson writ, about
                  yooniversal liberty and sich, wich hedn't bin quoted in Kentucky for twenty years,
                  and postid em up; in brief, hed Wendell Phillips' blessed sperit bin a hoverin
                  over that meetin-house, it wood hev smiled approvinly.</p>
               <p>I spoke to em elokently on the yooniversal brotherhood uv mankind, holdin that
                  whatever else cood be sed, Adam wuz the father uv all mankind, and that the only
                  diffrence between a white man and a nigger wuz, the nigger wuz sun-burnt. The
                  nigger, I remarkt, wuz, ondoubtedly, origenally white; but hevin bin, sence his
                  arrival in this country, addicted<pb n="110 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000057"/> to agricultooral persoots, he hed become tanned to
                  a degree wich, tho it marred his physikle beauty, did not interfere with his
                  sterlin goodnis uv heart. Ther bed bin diffrences between the races—at times ther
                  hed bin onpleasantnises wich no one regretted more than I. The whites uv the
                  Corners hed not alluz bin ez considrit ez I cood hev wished. They hed flogd sevral
                  uv em, and hung many more, and in times past hed held em in slavery and sich; but
                  that shood not be thot uv at this happy time. It wuz constooshnel to do these
                  things then, and Kentucky wuz eminently a law-abidin State. "Here," sez I, "on
                  this platform, with the flag uv our common country over me, I declare eternal
                  friendship to the colored man, and to seel the declarashen I thus embrace—"</p>
               <p>The obstinit nigger didn't stir a step.</p>
               <p>"Come up and fling yoor arms around me, you black cuss," sed I, in a stage
                  whisper. "Come up!"</p>
               <p>"No yoo don't, boss!" sed the nigger, in a loud voice, wich was audible all over
                  the church, and holdin out his hand. "I can't trust yoo a bressid minit. Gib me de
                  $5 fust. Yoo owe dis chile foah dollars now fo' sawin wood fo' yoah post offis,

                  cash in advance."</p>
               <p>This ruther destroyed the effect. The unities wuzn't preserved. The niggers in
                  front bust out in a torturing laff, and Pollock and Bigler rolld in convulsions uv
                  lafture, in wich half uv our people joined. Me a standin petrified, in the
                  attitood of embracin, and that cussed nigger standin with his hand extended for
                  the money, with the Deekin and Bascom horror-struck jist behind, formed a tabloo
                  wich wuz more strikin than pleasant.</p>
               <p>The meetin wuz to-wunst adjourned, for it wuz evident to the dullest comprehenshen
                  that nothin more coodent be done that nite. Ez yoosual I failed for want uv
                  capital. Hed I bin possesst uv the paltry sum uv five dollars, how diffrent wood
                  hev bin the result! Perchance we may, thro that defishency, lose Kentucky. It must
                  never occur agin—my salery must be raisd. I can't make brix without straw.</p>
               <p>Joe Bigler met me next mornin and remarkt that he regrettid the occurrence, ez he
                  ardently desired to see the two races a pullin together. "The fault, Perfessor,"
                  sed he, "wuz in not managin properly. The next time yoo want a 'spectable nigger
                  to sit<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7103-00000059"/> on the platform with yoo and the
                  Deekin, or kiss or embrace yoo—git him drunk. He'll do it then, probably—I know he
                  will. Ef he's drunk enuff, he'll hurrah for Johnson, and it's possible to git em
                  down to the pint uv votin with yoo. Lord! how whiskey drags a man down. See wat
                  it's brot yoo to!" and the insultin wretch rolled off, laffin boisterously. "Git
                  em drunk, Perfesser!" he yelled ez long ez he cood see me.</p>
               <p>We don't intend to give it up. Bigler's advice wuz given in jest; but,
                  nevertheless, I shel act upon it. Whiskey is wat brings white men to us; and ef a
                  white man kin be thus capchered, why not a nigger? The Afrikin hezn't got ez far
                  to fall to git down to our level, and it'll take less to bring him. Bascom ordered
                  five barrels to-day, wich I spose the Administrashen will pay for. We hev yet the
                  Noo York Custom House, and more uv the perkesits must be yoosed for politikle
                  purposes.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THE news uv the election in Connecticut created the most profound sensashen at the
                  Corners. It cum to us so onexpected, so like a clap uv thunder from a clear sky,
                  or ruther so like a gleam uv sunlite thro a mass uv overpowrin black clouds, so
                  like the first streak uv sunlite in the mornin after a long nite uv cholera morbus
                  with no brandy in the house, that we wuz overpowered with it. The Corners hevn't
                  experienct sich a satisfactory spasm uv joy sence the receet uv the news uv the
                  Fort Piller affair. It perdoost a very singler effect on Deekin Pogram. When I cum
                  up to him with the news, he wuz engaged with all the elokence he possest a trying
                  to convince a nigger, wich formerly belonged to him, that, after all, the
                  Southerners themselves<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7103-00000060"/> selves wuz the
                  only ones wich the niggers cood trust; and that when the time cum for em to
                  exercise the 'lective franchise, ef they hed any regard for their own interests
                  they wood turn their backs on the Ablishinists, who wuz, to a man, hory headed
                  deceevers, and trust them and them only who knowd em.</p>
               <p>"Samyooel," sed the Deekin, in a affecshunit tone, with one hand on the nigger's
                  shoulder, "why shoodent we love yoo? Yoo are bone uv our bone, and flesh uv our
                  flesh—we are uv one blood—" (this remark the Deekin got into a habit some years
                  ago uv gittin off when speekin uv the Dimocrisy North, and alluz uses it. It is
                  ruther effective, tho in this instance, ef I hed bin in his place, I shoodent hev
                  slung it out, owin to the pecooliar construckshen wich mite be put onto it)—"and
                  our interests is one, Samyooel."</p>
               <p>"Deekin," sez I, interruptin him. "Deekin! Connecticut hez spoken in thunder
                  tones, and hez gone Dimocratic!"—</p>
               <p>"Wat!" sez he, "Dimocratic!"</p>
               <p>"Verily," sez I. "A Governer, and three Congressmen out of four."</p>
               <p>Ther wuz a sudden rupcher uv the friendly relashens existin between the Deekin and
                  Samyooel the dark complexioned. If he wuz uv the Deekin's flesh, the Deekin wuz in
                  favor of mortifyin it; for never wuz flesh so belabored ez wuz that unfortunit
                  chattel's. The flesh wuz imejitly lasserated. He pitched into him feroshus; and
                  after pummelin the astonished Aferkin, who didn't see why the result of a
                  eleckshun shood work sich a change, till he wuz out uv breath, he condenst wat
                  strength wuz remainin into one vigrous kick, exclaimin—</p>
               <p>"Take that, yoo black swindler. I've talked sweet to yoo under false pretenses.
                  I've bin betrayed into wastin soft sawder onto a nigger—into coaxin wher I hev a
                  ondeniable rite to command—into—"</p>
               <p>"Wat does all dis mean?" sed the nigger, faintly.</p>
               <p>"Mean!" sed I to him; "my frend, this is the reaction we've heard so much
                  about—it's arriv. It means that there is a exceedinly good chance uv yoor bein
                  redoost agin to yoor normal speer; uv yoor comin down from the high hoss yoove bin
                  a ridin, and uv bein agin a servant unto yoor brethren. It means that Connecticut
                  hez spoken, and that yoor a good deal more valyooable to us now than yoo wuz a
                  hour ago. Go, my friend, and buy salve for yoor brooses; for unless yoor heeld
                  yoor valyoo will<pb n="116 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7103-00000061"/> be less in
                  the markit. Yoo'd be ashamed to sell for a low price—woodent yoo?"</p>
               <p>I left the Dimocrisy jubilatin and come on to Washinton, feelin that I must go
                  where I cood find kindred soles. The nite I arrived there wuz high carnival at the
                  White House. The President wuz in tall feather. Ther wuz Connecticut visible all
                  over him. He hed a wooden nutmeg for a buzzum pin—a minatoor bass-wood ham hung
                  from his watch fob, and in honor uv the occashun they wuz drinkin punches made of
                  Noo England rum, with small slices uv Wetherfield onyuns in em insted uv lemons.
                  Randall sprung toward me ez I entered the room, and clasped me by one hand, the
                  President by tother, and we then—not altogether onlike the three graces—embraced.
                  They hed the advantage uv me, ez they hed one odor—the onion—wich I hedent, but I
                  stood it. Why not, when that odor wuz from the breaths of those hevin the apintin
                  power? I wood hev stood it hed they bin eatin assafœtida.</p>
               <p>At this juncter Sekretary Welles come in.</p>
               <p>"Ha!" said he, "why this unwonted hilarity! why this joy wher greef generally
                  holds her court!"</p>
               <p>"The Conneticut elecshun," said Seward.</p>
               <p>"O, to be sure," sed the venerable old man,<figure>
                     <head>THREE GRACES Page 116.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="117" xml:id="VAC7103-00000062"/> vacantly; "I remember. Hawley, wuz it, or
                  some other man who wuz elected over—over—wat wuz his name?—our candidate?"</p>
               <p>"That wuz last yeer!" sed Seward, angrily.</p>
               <p>"Well, perhaps it wuz. When did that State vote agin?" asked he, innocently, to
                  wich no anser wuz given. But very little attention is paid to Sekretary Welles by
                  any one 'ceptin Seward, and the fact that he occasionally undertakes to keep him
                  postid in current events is ginerally taken ez evidence that he's breakin up. Poor
                  William, it's evident that he's passin into his dotage.</p>
               <p>Ther wuz a pleasant gatherin. Cowan wuz ther, and Saulsbury, and Garret Davis, and
                  Doolittle, and Seymour, and Brooks, and more congratulatory letters wuz read than
                  wood fill a page of the Noo York Herald. John C. Breckinridge hoped this
                  auspicious event wuz the beginnin uv good feelin, presagin, ez he trusted it did,
                  the evenchooel triumph uv them wich he hed alluz bin proud to call his friends.
                  Mayor Monroe, uv Noo Orleens, hoped that, after this evidence uv returnin reason,
                  President Johnson wood not hesitate to remove that second Butler, Gen. Sheridan,
                  who wuz ojius to every friend the President had in the city uv wich he wuz lately
                  Mayor. Gen. Wise sent his congratulashens<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7103-00000063"
                  /> ulashens; but ez they okkepied thirty-eight pages uv legal cap paper, closely
                  written, they wuzn't read. Mosby sent a allegoricle pipe made uv a corn cob, onto
                  wich wuz carved a symbolicle nigger, with the American eagle, a clawin vishusly
                  into his wool, with his congratulations; and Fernando Wood, and Jesse D. Brite,
                  and Dan Voorhees, sent theirn, and Vallandigham wanted to know now whether or not
                  the President wuz a goin to accept the situashen, and take the Dimocratic party to
                  his buzzum? Ef so, he hed a list of apintments for Southern Ohio, wich he wished
                  made. At this pint the question arose whether or not I hed not better move my
                  Classicle and Military Institoot to Connecticut? I am a practicle man, and I
                  to-wunst asked, ez pertinent to the question, whether or not ther wuz a distillery
                  in Connecticut; and sekond, whether or not ther wuz a vacant post offis within
                  four miles uv it.</p>
               <p>Sekretary Randall replied. He woodent hold out indoosements that he coodent
                  fulfill. He wuz honest. Honesty wuz his best holt—simple, childlike
                  strate-forwardniss in his deelins in politix wuz his cheef failin, and had well
                  nigh been his rooin. The first query was easy to anser—the eleckshun returns wood
                  indicate to any man uv ordinary intellek lek that ther wuz distilleries either in
                  Connecticut or very handy to the State; but ther wuz no Post Offisis to spare. To
                  carry the State every wun of em had bin solemnly promised.</p>
               <p>The President remarkt that he reely shoodent think that triflin circumstance wood
                  interfere with givin uv em to other men.</p>
               <p>At this pint I broke in. I told em firmly that onless I cood hev a better post
                  offis than the wun I hed, I woodent go. I cood go and cood move wat there is of
                  the College bildins. It woodent cost much to pay freight on that corner-stun. I
                  spose a better one cood be got in Connecticut at less than the cost uv transportin
                  it, but wherever that Dimocratic College is built that must be the corner-stun uv
                  it. That stun is hallowed. Ther are tender assosiashens hangin round it. It wuz
                  the cornerstone uv a nigger school-house wich we burnt to the ground the nite we
                  heard uv the veto uv the Civil Rites Bill. But I won't go to Connecticut onless my
                  subsistence is asshoored. Ther is more money ther than in Kentucky; but I doubt
                  whether they wood support me ez well. I speek frankly. I kin understand why a man
                  kin be a Dimocrat in Kentucky—he's interested in niggers. I kin appreciate the
                  Dimocrisy uv Suthern Injeany, Illinois,<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7103-00000064"/>
                  and Ohio, coz they come from that region, and the sekond generashun ain't got to
                  be voters. I kin understand the Dimocrisy in Heenan's and Fernando Wood's
                  deestricks, but pardon me—I want to keep very clear uv Connecticut Democrats. A
                  people anywhere in Noo England wich kin deliberitly ally theirselves to us is just
                  the kind uv people I don't want to be among. I instinctively mistrust a Yankee who
                  hez dickered away his intrest in Bunker Hill. I hev notist that a Noo Englander
                  wich come South and married an old maid, or a widder with a plantation, wuz never
                  to be trustid; and it's my experience that a demoralized Yankee—one who hez shed
                  his early trainin, and took up anybody else's moral close—is about the meanest
                  specimen uv a white man on the face uv the green earth. He hez the acootnis wich
                  is born uv a barren soil, without the Puritanism to keep it within bounds; he
                  possesses the ability to make a livin on his native rox, but his laziness impels
                  him to a easier subsistence in milder climes; and instid uv fishin for mackrel he
                  goes South and fishes for men. A Noo Englander, unrestrained by grace, is pizen,
                  and I bleeve Connecticut is full uv em. I hev heerd Massachoosits religion
                  aboozed, but its suthin we may well be thankful for. I hev alluz bin thankful ful
                  that the Mayflower brot over religion ez well ez brains and will.</p>
               <p>Among the Connecticut Democrisy I shood stand no show; and, beside, I hev too much
                  self-respeck to soshiate with em on terms uv equality. Instid uv foragin on them,
                  they'd manage to live on me. I hev lambs to shear in Kentucky, and I don't care
                  about changin em. I don't want to throw any cold water onto this festive occasion,
                  it being a element we all despise; but, hev we any asshoorence uv her continyooin
                  troo? Ef I understand it, we won by means uv patronage, and running a War
                  Democrat—a bein I, in common with all the troo Democricy, despise. We can't do it
                  agin. The next blast that sweeps from the North will bring to our ears a story uv
                  another kind. One swaller don't make a spring. I hev knowd uv calves being born
                  with two heads. This election, I fear me, is one uv these monstrosities wich
                  Nacher sometimes perdooses to show what she is capable uv. It ain't normal. I hev
                  no objeckshun to yoor feelin good over it—it rejoict me, coz it'll give our
                  friends South courage, and may skeer the Radicals into givin us better terms,
                  but—</p>
               <p>My remarks wuz interrupted by Saulsbury, who hed bin sureptitiously drinkin punch
                  with the ladle,<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7103-00000065"/> and the odor uv the
                  onions overcomin him he rolled under the table, and very shortly thereafter the
                  meetin broke up. I leave for home to-morrer, or ez soon ez I kin draw my

               <p>IT'S done! Seward did it—him and me! The American Eagle hez coz now to screem with
                  redoubled energy. Ef the Nashnel bird wuz a angel, I shood remark to it, "Toon
                  yoor harp anoo;" but it ain't, and therefore sich a rekest wood be ridiculous.
                  This rapsody hez refrence to the Rooshen purchis.</p>
               <p>The idea originatid in these massive intelleck. When I wuz here afore, the Blairs,
                  all uv em, wuz a crowdin the sainted Johnson for a mishun. Cowan wantid a mishun,
                  and so did Doolittle; and that day pretty much all uv the delegates to the
                  Cleveland and Philadelphy Convenshens had bin there, wantin some kind uv a place;
                  wat, they wuzn't pertikeler. One<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7103-00000066"/>
                  gentleman, whose nose (wich trooly blossomed ez the lobster) betokened long
                  service in the party, urged that he hed bin a delegate to both Convenshens. "Thank
                  God!" sed Johnson. "Wood that both them Convenshens hed bin made up uv the same
                  men. I wood then hev bin bored for places only half ez much ez I am."</p>
               <p>I wuz a helpin him out in my weak way. When the crowd wantin places become too
                  great for human endoorance, I wood say, in a modrit tone, "Let's go out and git
                  suthin;" and to-wunst fully half wood exclaim, "Thank yoo, I don't keer ef I do!"
                  It wuz a great relief to Johnson, but wuz pizen on me. With the most uv em, the
                  anguish, anxiety, and solissitood in the gittin uv offises and free drinks wuz
                  about an ekal thing. The offisis they wantid wuz merely the means to that
                  pertikeler end; and so long ez they wuz gittin the latter without the trouble uv
                  the former, they wuz content. A good constooshen and a copper-lined stumick
                  carried me thro this tryin ordeel, until I came across a Boston applicant, who, in
                  consekence uv the perhibitory law, hed bin for some time on short rashens, and wuz
                  keen set. Napoleon hed then met his Wellington, and I succumd. The man's talent
                  wuz wonderful.</p>
               <p>Sekretary Seward wuz in trouble about the Blair family pertikerly. He hed did his
                  level best for em. He hed appinted em to Collekterships and furrin mishuns; but
                  the crooel Senit, wich hed no respeck for us, took delite in fastening uv em onto
                  us by perpetooally rejectin em. Jest after a long siege by Montgomery and the old
                  man, I sejestid the purchis uv the Rooshen Territory, to wich not only they cood
                  be sent, but a thousand uv others wich we hed on our hands; and the Sekretary wuz
                  so pleased at the idea that he wept like a child. With a vigor wonderful in one so
                  old, he set about gittin testimonials ez to the valyoo uv the territory, to
                  inflooence the Senit in ratifyin the treaty he was agoin to make. And he wrote to
                  a naval officer about it, who answered more promptly than I ever knowd a naval
                  offiser to do, ez follows:—</p>
               <p>"It's trooly a splendid country! The trade in the skins uv white bears kin be, ef
                  properly developed, made enormous. There is seals there, and walruses so tame that
                  they come up uv their own akkord to be ketched.</p>
               <p>"P. S.—In case the purchis shood be made, a naval stashen will be necessary. May I
                  hope that my long services on the Floridy Coast would prove<pb n="126-127"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000067"/> suffishent recommendashen for the command uv the
                  depot? May I?</p>
               <p>"I hev the honor to be," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A distinguished Perfessor wrote:—</p>
               <p>"The climate is about the style uv that they hev in Washinton. The Gulf Stream
                  sweeps up the coast, causing a decided twist in the isothermal line, wich hez the
                  effeck uv making it ruther sultry than otherwise. Anywheres for six hundred miles
                  back uv the coast strawberries grow in the open air. I recommend strongly the
                  purchis.</p>
               <p>"P. S.—In case the purchis is made, a explorin expedishen will be necessary. May I
                  hope that my scientiffik attainments are suffishently well known to yoo to
                  recommend me as a proper person to head the expedishen? May I?</p>
               <p>"I hev the honor to be," et settry.</p>
               <p>The President wuzn't favorably inclined. He wuz full uv the old fogy idea that it
                  wuz rather chilly there than otherwise. He hedn't faith in the Isothermal Line,
                  and wuz skepticle about the Gulf Stream. It wuz his experience that the further
                  North yoo got the colder it wuz. For instance, he remarkt, that while the people
                  wuz warm toward him in Virginny and Maryland, last fall, they became very cold ez
                  he got North. Wher wuz the Isothermal Line and the Gulf Stream then?</p>
               <p>Randall, who will hev his joke, remarkt that the isothermal line twisted. He
                  notist that the people made it ez hot for em ez he wantid it ez fur North ez
                  Cleveland; to wich Sekretary Welles replied, that it only confirmed him in the
                  opinion that for platin vessels uv war, iron wuz preferable to pine plank any
                  time.</p>
               <p>Seward removed the President's objections to-wunst. He read his letters, wich set
                  forth the beauties and advantages uv the country twict over. Here wuz whales, and
                  walrusses, and seals, and white bears, and pine-apples, and wheat, and sealions,
                  and fields uv ice the year round, in a climit ez mild and equable ez the meridian
                  uv Washinton. The isothermal line wuz more accommodatin ther than in any other
                  part uv the world. It cork-screwed through the territory so ez to grow fine
                  peaches for exportation to the States, and ice to the Sandwich Islands, side by
                  side. He drawd a picter uv the white bear a rushin over the line, and disportin
                  hisself in fields uv green peas! Imagine, he remarked, the delicacy uv Polar bear
                  meat fattened<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7103-00000068"/> on strawberries; think uv
                  the condishn the sealions must be in which leave their watery lairs to feed on
                  turnips wich grow above the both parallel; think uv—</p>
               <p>"It won't do," sed the President.</p>
               <p>"Think uv," retortid the Sekretary, with a quicknis uv intellek remarkable,
                     "<emph>think uv gettin rid uv the Blairs forever!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Will the Ablishn Senit ratify the treaty?" askt Johnson, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"I converst with many on the subjick, and they sed ef we cood promise that the
                  Blairs would accept posishens ther, they wood do it cheerfly. For sich a purpose,
                  sed one uv em to me, $7,000,000 is a mere bagatelle."</p>
               <p>"I'll do it," sed Johnson. "I agree with the Senators for once. Rather then hev it
                  fail, I'd pay it out uv Mrs. Cobb's share in our jint spekelashens. Freedom from
                  the Blair family! Good Hevings! kin one man be so blest? Is ther sich in store for
                  me? $7,000,000! Pish!"</p>
               <p>My opinyun being askt, I give it. Ez hefty ez the vencher is from a commershl
                  stan-pint, in a politikle pint uv view, the advantagis will be still heftier. The
                  Rooshn territory will finally be the chosen home uv the Dimocrisy. Ther is already
                  a populashen there adaptid to us, who kin be manipulated without trouble, and the
                  climit is favorable to a strickly Democratic populashen. The trouble with us here
                  is that the amount uv likker necessary to the manufakter uv a Democrat kills him
                  afore he hez a opportoonity uv votin many times, wich keeps us in a perpetooal
                  minority. Our strength is, for climatic reasons, our weaknis. Far diffrent is it
                  in Roosha. Ther the happy native may drink his quart per day—the bracin atmosphere
                  makin it abslootly nessary for him. Ther is the troo Democratic paradise. How
                  offen hev I sighed for sich a country. Then, again, ther are posishens uv profit.
                  The delegates to Congriss will, ef I hev figgered it rightly, draw about $15,000
                  per session, mileage, wich is $30,000 per year, $60,000 per term. He cood afford
                  to serve without the paltry $5,000, wich wood be cheep legislatin, indeed.</p>
               <p>And so it wuz agreed upon, and the treaty wuz made by telegraph at a expense uv—I
                  forgit eggsackly—but I think it wuz summers in the neighborhood uv $20,000. Before
                  it wuz finely conclooded, some other little incidentals wuz inclooded by the Zar,
                  wich run the price up to $10,200,000, but that wuz nothin for us. Seward went at
                     his<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7103-00000069"/> work with great energy. The
                  Purchis wuz divided up into six territories (for the number uv delegates to our
                  convenshuns wuz large, and they all hed to be provided for), wich wuz named,
                  respectively, Johnson, Seward, Cowan, Doolittle, Randall, and Welles. For the one
                  in the extreme North, the furthest off, Frank Blair wuz appinted Governor; for the
                  next, Montgomery; and the next, the old man, and the other three wuz held in
                  reserve for the pure but unfortunate patriots wich might be hereafter rejected for
                  the Austrian mishun. A list wuz prokoored uv the delegates to our various
                  convenshuns, and them ez hed bin martyred by the Senit; ther names wuz put into a
                  wheel ez at Gift Enterprises, and the Judgeships, Marshalships, Clerkships, et
                  settry, wuz drawd by lot. This ijee was sejested by Postmaster-General Randall, ez
                  bein the easiest way of doin it. He statid that the appintments from his
                  department hed alluz bin made in this manner, ez it saved time in eggsaminin
                  petitions, cirtifikets uv fitnis, and sich. In this way, about ez near ez I kin
                  estimate, two per cent. uv those claimin posishens at our hands hev bin provided
                  for.</p>
               <p>The idea is capable uv unlimited extension. The Administration feelin the releef
                  it hez gin em, are already negotiatin for the British Provinces. This territory
                  kin, by makin uv em a little smaller, be divided up into—say, forty—which, by
                  makin a few more offises for each, and bein libral with explorin expedishuns and
                  sich, will be sufficient to give places to all who really have claims upon us and
                  who are pushin us.</p>
               <p>The President breathes easier, and the Secretary is placid ez a Summer mornin. He
                  hez cut the Gordian knot; he hez releeved hisself uv the boa constrickter wich wuz
                  crushin him in its folds. Happiness pervades the White House.</p>

               <p>TIMES changes, and men change jist ez fast ez times. I should like to see the
                  times wich kin change faster than I kin; but this last shift I hev bin forced to
                  make, ruther took my breth. It wuz sudden. The Connecticut eleckshun didn't do us
                  much good after all. We felt well over it for perhaps a day; but ez we begun to
                  git other indicashens from the North, we didn't jist see how that little spirt wuz
                  agoin to help us. Cincinnati went Ablishin stronger than ever. Chicago ditto; and
                  most everywhere the Dimocratic rooster wuz flattened. The cabinet, when they heerd
                  uv Deekin Pogram's assault upon the nigger, on the receet uv the intelligence uv
                  the election news, notified me officially that a repetishen uv sich loonacy wood
                  be equivalent to a reseet uv my resignation, even tho the post offis shood be

                  his recklessniss, and borrowed four dollars uv Bascom, who is the only man in the

               <p>We held a meetin uv the Drecktors and Faculty uv the Southern Military and
                  Classicle Institoot last evening, to decide wat course that instooshn wuz to take
                  in the grate work uv surroundin the Ethiopian and attachin uv him to us. In sich a
                  time ez this, ez I menshend to Captain McPelter, it won't do for our institooshuns
                  uv learning to stand back. These great levers, the molders uv public opinion, must
                  be ez progressive ez the progressiveist, and must change like other things to meet
                  the requirements uv the times. We hev commenst our march into Africa, and thus far
                  hev we gone into the bowels uv the land without impediment, to speak uv—let us
                  persevere. Let us capcher the Ethiopian, stink and all.</p>
               <p>The meetin wuz held in the back room uv Bascom's, owing to the fact that it wuz
                  rainin, and the<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7103-00000071"/> roof uv the Post Offis
                  leaks. I hed an appropriashn some time since from the Department for repairs; but
                  bein in doubt whether it wuz intended for repairs on the Post Offis or the
                  Postmaster, I gave the prizner the benefit uv the doubt, and got a new pair uv
                  boots. I cood better endoor the slite inconvenience uv occasional rain than to go
                  barefoot.</p>
               <p>I made a statement uv the case, and sejisted a radical change in the Institoot.
                  Captain McPelter agreed with me. He felt that ther hedn't bin that complete,
                  hearty recognition uv our Afrikan brethren as there ought to be. He had on several
                  occasions allowed his nateral vivacity to git the better of his proodence, and hed
                  waded into em alarmin. The old ijee of Ham and Hagar and Onesimus hed bin so
                  drilled into him in his yooth, that he hed to wrestle with it to keep it in
                  control, and in spite uv himself it often got the better uv him. He sejisted that
                  the name uv the Institoot be changed from "The Southern Military and Classikle
                  Institoot," to "The Ham and Japheth Free Academy for the Development uv the
                  Intellek uv all Races, irrespectiv uv Color."</p>
               <p>That he thought would anser the required end. The colored men who choose to avail
                  theirselves of the priviligis afforded by this institooshn, when it is finished,
                  kin find in this no cause uv complaint. They are recognized. They are given the
                  precedence. They stand first in the matter and foremost. Wat more kin they
                  ask?</p>
               <p>Bascom hed a series uv resolooshuns wich he desired to present. He sed it mite be
                  looked upon ez strange that he shood favor the concentrashun uv free niggers at
                  the Corners, but he hed good and suffishent reasons. First, he hed faith that
                  constant contact with the Board wood bring em to the pint uv patronizin his bar;
                  but ef it didn't, he knowd perfectly well that the Board and Fakulty wood manage
                  to git all they hed, for board and tooition, wich he was perfectly certin he'd git
                  in the end. Wat he wanted wuz people here: to yoose an illustration borrered from
                  his biznis, the offishels uv this Institoot wuz the funnel through wich the wealth
                  uv all uv em wood be conducted to his coffers. I fell onto his neck in rapcher,
                  and then vowed that I wuz willin to die for his good—that I cared not how much uv
                  other people's money run through me to him ef 'twas thus dilooted. The
                  resolooshens presented read ez follows:—</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That the name uv the Southern Military and Classikle
                  Institoot be changed to 'The Ham<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7103-00000072"/> and
                  Japheth Free Academy, for the Development uv the Intelleck uv all Races,
                  irrespective uv Color.'</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That in makin this change, we, the Board uv Directors, do
                  so, assertin,</p>
               <p>"1. That in this emergency we are justified in doubtin whether Noer got tite at
                  all, the statement in the Skripters to that effect bein ondoubtedly an error uv
                  the translators.</p>
               <p>"2. That ef he did git tite, he didn't cuss Ham at all.</p>
               <p>"3. That ef he did cuss Ham, the cuss wuzn't intended to extend beyond Canaan at
                  the furthest, and hence his descendants go scot free.</p>
               <p>"4. That ef the cuss wuz really and trooly intended to attach to all uv Ham's
                  descendents, irrespective uv color, to the end uv time, it ain't uv no effeck in
                  Kentucky, ez that State hez allus run irrespective uv any code, 'ceptin sich ez
                  hez bin adopted by her Legislacher.</p>
               <p>"5. That the theory that the nigger, irrespective uv color, is a beast, is a
                  deloosion, a snare, which we hev alluz practically held, no matter what we may,
                  for effect, hev sed, ez the number uv mulattoes, to say nothin uv them still
                  farther bleached in Kentucky, abundantly proves.</p>
               <p>"6. That the Ethiopian, irrespective uv color, is trooly a man and a brother; and
                  the female Ethiopian, also irrespective uv color, trooly a woman and a sister.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That this Institoot, whose name is now so happily
                  changed, shel be conducted upon the principles uv strict ekality, irrespective uv
                  color.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That when we reflect that the bloated aristocracy uv
                  England interdoost, and the early settlers of Massachoosets sankshund, slavery on
                  this continent, forcin it really onto us, we bile with indignashun towards em, and
                  kin hardly restrane ourselves.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That at the tables, in the choice uv rooms, and in all
                  matters where there is a choice, the African man and brother, irrespective uv
                  color, shel hev the precedence.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That Oberlin College, by not givin the sons uv Ham,
                  irrespective uv color, the precedence, shows clearly that it is actooated by
                  narrerminded prejudice, wich deserves the reprobashen uv every lover uv his
                  kind.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That the Ethiopian, irrespective uv color, kin change his
                  skin, and that his oder, ef he hez any, is rather pleasant than otherwise.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That we look with loathing upon the States North, wich,
                  alluz professin friendship for<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7103-00000073"/> the
                  noble black man uv the cotton fields, refooze to take him to their buzzums,
                  irrespective uv color.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That ef Massachoosits and Vermont, and Northern Illinois,
                  and the Western Reserve in Ohio, are honest in their professions uv love for the
                  negro, they will come down with donashuns to assist in the completion uv the
                  Academy."</p>
               <p>Deekin Pogram didn't know about all this. He hed bin edikated in Ham and Hager,
                  and wuz a bleever in Onesimus. He doubted. Sposen after all this concession the
                  nigger shood play off onto us? Sposen he shoodent vote with us after all, but
                  cling to his Northern friends? Or spose he shood vote with us, and we shood, thro
                  his vote, git control, wat then? How cood we redoose em to ther normal condition
                  agin after all this palavrin?</p>
               <p>Bascom replied that he wuz surprised at the Deekin's obtoosnis. First, ef they did
                  vote with the Ablishnists, we wuz no worse off, ez that wuz wat they proposed to
                  do any how. Ef, on the other hand, they didn't, what then? The trouble with em now
                  is, they know too much. "Let em," sed Bascom, warmin up, "let em associate with us
                  a year, let em vote with us, et cettry, and in twelve months they're precisely
                  fitted agin to be servance unto their brethren. Look," sed he, "at the Northern
                  Dimocrasy, and see to what we may hope to bring these men in time."</p>
               <p>But little more bizness wuz transacted. Beverly Nash, of South Caroliny, was
                  unanimously called to a Professorship; and a young gentleman uv color, who, from
                  his strong resemblance to Elder Gavitt, ought to hev biznis capacity, wuz
                  unanimously elected a member of the Board. The yoonyun is perfect. Ham and Japheth
                  hev shaken hands, and are embracin each other.</p>
               <p>May prosperity attend the nupchels, and may the isshoo be fortunate. I hev got
                  over the disgust attendant upon the fust chill, and am consekently feelin
                  well.</p>

               <p>WE are in continyooal trouble down here with these cussid niggers. They are harder
                  to manage than pigs. Pigs don't express ther pecoolyarities. Mules come nearer.
                  Ther is sich a method in their obstinacy—sich a wilful cussidnis, that I reely hev
                  made up my mind that I don't understand em at all. They cuddle up to us ez kind ez
                  a bloomin maiden does to her first adored, and they fling us just ez natral ez
                  that same guileless maiden does when number two heaves in site. They behave well
                  for a season, aperrently for no other purpose than to enjoy our discomfiture when
                  they finally throw us. I hev bin a gittin a suspishen thro me that they ain't half
                  ez stoopid ez they look; and that, after all, we are not fur from the trooth when
                  we say, in our resolooshens, that they are the ekals uv the whites. Why shoodn't
                  they be? Ah! why, indeed? Why shoodent the nigger boy, wich is now crossin the
                  street, wich hez Deekin Pogram's feechers ez like ez a photograff, hev ez much
                  sense ez the Deekin? I hev egsamined into the pedigree uv that nigger, and I find
                  that his mother hed the hawtiest and best blood uv Virginny coursin toomulchusly
                  thro her veins—and that stock the Pogram mix coodent materially depreciate in one
                  generashen.</p>
               <p>I hed the niggers uv the X Roads very handsomely in tow up to yisterday. I hed em
                  attendin services last Sunday at the meetin-house, and by private arrangement hed
                  em seated miscellaneously among the awjence. Dekin Pogram hed a wench, wich
                  weighed at least 250 pounds averdupoise, atween him and his wife, while four other
                  niggers ornamentid his pew. Bascom, with alacrity, consented to three; and Elder
                  Gavitt provided seats for four. It wuz a pleasant site! White and black wuz
                  alternatid like the spots on a checker-board—niggers and whites wuz spread out
                  together like the fat and lean in pork; and ez I seed it I cood<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000075"/> hardly restrane my emoshuns. There before me wuz
                  the regenerashun uv the Democratic party—there wuz wat wuz to bring us out uv the
                  valley and shadder uv death into wich we hed fallen, up on the high ground uv
                  offishel life. I preached that memrable day from two texts, to wit: "Uv one blood
                  did he make all the nashens uv the earth," and "All ye are brethren;" and I orated
                  a movin discourse. I demonstrated with great fervor the loonacy uv the idea that
                  the Almighty wood take the trouble to create two or more races when one wood do ez
                  well—wich idea is alluz well receeved in this region. All men form their idea uv
                  the Deity somewhat from themselves; and I never knowd a Confedrit Cross Roader to
                  make two things when one wood anser. I refuted the theory, advanced by some
                  writers, that there wuz more than one head to the race, by quotin the texts wich
                  treated uv the creashen uv Adam and Eve, and demolished the Ham doctrine at site.
                  "Ef," sed I, "Noer did cuss Ham, and condemn Canaan to be a servant unto his
                  brethren, how do we know that our colored brethren and sistren <emph>is</emph> the
                  desendants uv Ham and Canaan? It may be <emph>us</emph> for all we know! Is it his
                  color? Is not black jest ez convenient a color ez white?"</p>
               <p>"More so," murmured Mrs. Pogram, half asleep, "more so—it don't show dirt."</p>
               <p>"Is it his shape? O, my brethren, I ain't a handsome man, nor wood I exactly anser
                  for a model for Apoller. Ef beauty, or comeliness, or shape, or style, is to
                  decide the pint, may the Lord help us! Is it his smell? My brethren, the New York
                  World asserts that the nigger hain't no smell, and ef he hez, why shoodent he hev?
                  Standin under the common flag uv our country, with his hand upon that magna
                  charta, the Deklarashen, and his beamin eye turned exultinly toward our nashnel
                  emblem, the eagle, shall not our Afrikin brother be allowed to smell jist ez he
                  chooses? Ef smell must be uniform, then let our Government establish a Burow uv
                  Perfoomery to-wunst. Besides, I take high religious grounds in this matter. Ef he
                  hez a natural odor, the Lord give it to him. Let us not fly in the face uv the
                  Lord by condemin it. Judge not, lest we be judged. The odor uv the colored
                  gentleman or lady is the work uv the Lord—the odor uv yoor unwashed feet is yoor
                  own—wich shood stand the highest?</p>
               <p>"My brethren and sistren, I acknowledge that I hev not long held these views. I
                  hev showed the common prejudis, and hev contemned our friends<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000076"/> uv color; I hev despitefully used 'em; I hev gone
                  for 'em, and banged 'em like old boots. But it wuz becoz I didn't know 'em. I
                  didn't see the kernel of meat under the rough shell: I didn't recognize the
                  glitrin diamond in the ebony coal. My eyes hev bin opened. Like Saul of Tarsus, I
                  see a lite. Sence the passage uv the Military Bill I hev diskivered many things
                  too tejus to menshun. I hev mostly found out all these things sence that
                  occurrence. But let us accept the situashen, and bless the Lord that it hez
                  resultid in developin excellences where we didn't expect to find 'em."</p>
               <p>There wuz an affectin scene after service wuz over. Deekin Pogram, Captain
                  McPelter, and Elder Gavitt shook hands with em with a degree uv corjality I didn't
                  expect. Trooly, them are great men. They develop a degree uv adaptability to
                  circumstances wich I didn't look for. I really bleeve if I'd a told em that it
                  wood hev a good effeck to kiss the nigger babies all round, that they'd a done it.
                  But I spared em this. There is such a thing ez laying it on too thick.</p>
               <p>But all this wuz spiled the next day. There wuz an eggstraordinarily heavy mail
                  that day. In addition to the paper wich Pollock, the Illinois storekeeper, takes,
                  ther wuz eight others; and to my surprise they wuz all directed to niggers. "Wat
                  is this?" thot I to myself. "Hev the Ablishnists uv the North determined upon
                  proselytin these men, and are they goin to flood this country with their
                  incendiary readin? Ez a Federal officer it's my dooty to look into the matter!"
                  Jist imagine my delirious joy at findin that they wuz Democratic papers from Noo
                  York and Ohio! "Thank Heaven!" sed I, "our people hev awakened to a sense uv the
                  necessity uv doin suthin;" and I handed the papers out to em with impressive
                  words, exhortin uv em to read em, ez they wuz trooth, and nothin but the
                  trooth.</p>
               <p>I ruther think they read em, for from that time out they avoided me ez though I
                  hed the plague. Ef I wuz a goin down the street, and one uv em wuz a comin up,
                  he'd cross the street; and the pecoolyer expression uv his countenance indicatid
                  that it wuzn't my majestick presence wich awd him. They hed loathin depicted on
                  their classick feechers. Unable to endoor this, I seezed one uv em, and asked why
                  I wuz treated thus?</p>

               <p>Wat cood I say? Wat cood I do? There it wuz in black and white; and from papers
                  whose Dimocrisy could not be questioned. I wuz dumbfoundid. The nigger stalked
                  hawtily and proudly away in one direckshen, while I sneaked off ruther sneakinly
                  in another.</p>
               <p>I hev one word to say to our brethren in the North. Yoo'r doublin our troubles,
                  and makin our burdens harder to bear. Why can't yoo understand common sense? Wat
                  hurt wood nigger suffrage do yoo up there wher ther ain't no niggers, and how much
                  wood it benefit us down here wher ther's millions uv em? Can't yoo see it? We
                  can't play the same game on the niggers that we used to play on the sturdy
                  yeomanry uv Berks County, Pennsylvany, and other localities. On all questions
                  heretofore the Dimocrisy hez allowed a liberal license. We hev bin Free Trade in
                  Noo York and Tariff in Pennsylvany the same year, and we cood do it. Sich
                  Dimocrats didn't git ther asshoorences from papers, owin to their inability to
                  perooze em rapidly, it bein so long afore they got a word spelled out that they
                  forgot the one precedin it, wich destroyed the connection, the continuity uv the
                  narrative, ef I may so speak, and wat we told em wuz gospel. That won't do with
                  the nigger down here. He reads, he does; and ef he don't, ther's alluz everywhere
                  some sich sneakin cuss ez Pollock, who reads for him, and they know wat they know
                  jist ez well ez anybody. Let em stop hammerin the nigger. It won't do. Ef he's to
                  be a man and a brother here, he must be a man and a brother there. Ef the Dimcrisy
                  must hev a race to look down on, let em turn<pb n="148-149"

               <p>A BLITE hez fallen o'er my soul. My eyes, albeit unused to the meltin mood, hev
                  distilled nothin but tears for twelve hours. A Piller hez fallen! In the
                  meetin-house there is a vacant pew, and a chair at Bascom's is without a setter.
                  Last nite, at precisely nine P. M., Elder Abimileck Gavitt departed this life,
                  aged 63 years and some odd months.</p>
               <p>I weep ez I write. The Elder wuz snufft out jest ez the flowers uv spring wuz
                  cumin—jest ez the weather wuz a gittin warm enough to go barefooted—jest when it
                  wuzn't nessary to bother about getting fire-wood, or be concerned about feedin the
                  stock—jest when it begins to be comfortable a settin<pb n="150-151"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000079"/> onto the grocery stoop—jest at the threshhold uv
                  six months' enjoyment. Why wuz he taken? Ekko ansers. The ways uv Providence is
                  inskrootable.</p>
               <p>Elder Gavitt wuz a native uv North Karliny, wich State he left in the blush uv
                  early manhood, jist after he wuz married. Wat he left North Karliny for, I never
                  wuz able to assertane percisely; but I hev understood that it wuz suthin in
                  connection with a smoke-house, and the hams wich did hang therein. He wuz in a
                  Whig naberhood—his naber, the proprietor of the smoke-house, wuz a Whig—ther wuz
                  sum hams mist—the rinds wuz found in his possession—Whig intolerance and
                  persekooshen. Upon sich slite evidence he wuz adjudged guilty of theft, and wuz
                  ignominiously rid on a rale, and ordered to leave the country in twenty-four
                  hours, wich he did, driftin nat'rally to Kentucky. Thank Heaven for sich outrages!
                  But for sich, Kentucky wood hev bin a Republican State, or wood hev remained
                  unsettled to this day.</p>
               <p>Elder Gavitt wuz alluz a Democrat uv the strictest sect. He voted for Jackson, and
                  reglerly for every Democratic candidate sence. He didn't read very much; indeed,
                  ef I remember right, he coodent do it at all, and wuz, consekently, stedfast in
                  the faith. He wuzn't shook about, and driven hither and yon by every wind, but
                  remained thro life fast in the groove into wich he hed bin origenelly sot. His
                  politikle creed wuz made up uv this one idee, to wit: Hatrid uv Noo England. He
                  hatid Noo England becoz Noo England hatid whiskey, wich he coodent git along
                  without, and slavery, uv wich he hed a hundred niggers. He votid agin Noo England
                  all his life reglerly, and ez many times on each eleckshen day ez he cood without
                  risk.</p>
               <p>My acquaintance with the deceest commenst about three years ago. It wuz at his
                  house I stopt on my advent into these parts. Ther wuz no need uv formel
                  introduckshens—ther wuz already a bond atween us wich knit our souls together. His
                  eye, ez it lit onto my nose, lighted up with a smile; and ez I gazed on hizzen, I
                  felt that he wuz indeed a man and a brother. He took me in—he sheltered me—he gave
                  me whereof to eat and to drink and to make merry, and with him I tarried till I
                  wuz reglerly installed ez pastor uv the Church, and thereby reglerly pervided
                  for.</p>
               <p>The cause uv the Elder's death wuz a broken heart. He wuz a ardent Confedrit, and
                  manfully bore up under the reverses of the war. His courage wuz unshaken doorin
                  the repeated successes uv the Federal armies; and even when emancipation<pb
                     n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7103-00000080"/> deprived him uv his slaves, he still
                  hed faith that, evenchooally, all wood be well. "We may be beeten now," wuz his
                  constant remark, "but the Northern Dimocrisy are all right, and thro them we'll
                  yet conker!" Confidin in em, bleevin in em, he held out brave up to the passage uv
                  the Military Reconstruckshen Bill.</p>
               <p>I then saw a change steel insensibly over my venerable friend. His head bowed with
                  supprest grief—his bosom throbbd with the emoshen that wuz strugglin for uttrance.
                  He wood come over to my offis five or six times a day, and ask me to read him that
                  passage uv the law givin the nigger the ballot. I wood do it, when, without sayin
                  a word, he wood reel off, with tears flowin down his wasted cheeks, to Bascom's. I
                  wood foller him, to see that no harm came to him. The old man wuz so broken that
                  he'd pay for his own likker and mine too, without noticin. Fearin to awaken
                  unpleasant emoshens in his mind, I never menshend the latter circumstance.</p>
               <p>Things grew worse with him. When Mr. Randall wrote me to consiliate the niggers ez
                  Wade Hampton wuz a doin it, the old father in Democrisy obeyed without a murmur.
                  Democrisy wuz his first idea, and he obeyed her behests, tho 'twuz consoomin his
                  very sole. He shook hands with niggers at my rekest, tho the touch wuz ez red hot
                  iron; he took two of em into his pew, tho his promoxity to em set him a shakin
                  like the ager; and he votid to change the name and objects uv the Institoot, tho
                  the convulsive workins uv his face showd wat the struggle cost him.</p>
               <p>Day by day the Elder faded. The iron entered his sole, and it wuz corrodin!
                  corrodin! corrodin! and eatin him up by degrees. He walked the streets listlessly,
                  his eyes suffoosed with teers, and his lips movin ez ef mutterin suthin to
                  hisself. I become concerned for him, and so did the entire cirkle. Bascom figgered
                  up his akkount at his bar, and went to the records to see whether his farm wuz
                  unencumbered, and sich uv the neighbors ez hed lent him small sums sot about
                  gittin em.</p>
               <p>Last Sunday the pitcher went to the well for the last time. I hed four niggers in
                  his pew, upon whom he looked vacantly, but sed nothin. After servis, I stopped
                  him. "Elder," sez I, in a whisper, "it wood hev a good effeck ef yoo cood kiss
                  them little nigger girls."</p>
               <p>"Parson!" sed he, tremblin like a leaf, "is it abslootely necessary?"</p>
               <p>"It is," sez I firmly, "a dooty evry Dimokrat<pb n="154-155"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000081"/> owes to his party, in this crisis, to kiss ez many
                  nigger children ez possible."</p>
               <p>A strange expression lit up the old man's countenance. In a frenzied manner he
                  kissed all there wuz in the church, and, ez ef insane, commenst on the adult
                  femails uv that persuasion. With difficulty we restrained him; but breakin loose
                  from us, he startid down the street, a running down and kissin every nigger child
                  his eyes restid on. Finally he sunk to the erth eggsaustid, and we bore him to his
                  house and put him to bed. From that bed he never ariz. He wuz a goner. We hed to
                  give him his likker in a spoon, and I never knowed a Kentuckian to recover who wuz
                  past drinkin out uv a bottle.</p>
               <p>Slowly his strength wasted. Yesterday he rallied and asked for me, ez the candle
                  uv life flickered feebly in the socket.</p>
               <p>"Perfesser!" sed he, with an effort, "is Kentucky to rool the niggers, or the
                  niggers to rool Kentucky? Has the Dimocrisy swallered the nigger, or the nigger
                  swallered the Dimocrisy?"</p>
               <p>And all wuz o'er! He fell back a piece uv clay, wich never cood rally to the poles
                  agin.</p>
               <p>Bascom and I turned aside and wept. Sed Bascom, "Hed he lived two years more I
                  wood hev hed his farm."</p>
               <p>"Not any," sed I, bustin into teers. "I wood hev hed it to endow the
                  Institoot."</p>
               <p>"In that event it wood evenchooally hev bin mine," gasped Bascom, relapsin into a
                  fresh spasm uv grief.</p>
               <p>We buried him yesterday. It wuz the biggest funeral ever knowd at the Corners. It
                  was a tetchin site. Standin around his bier, wuz his four children by his first
                  wife, and his six children by his second wife, and twelve or fifteen other
                  children uv all colors, from that uv a new saddle up to dark molasses, who
                  insisted upon bein counted in ez mourners. It wuz the tightest place I wuz ever in
                  in my life.</p>
               <p>"My friends," sed I to em, "is this seemly? Is this proper?"</p>
               <p>They replied that it wuz. "I mourn a father," sed one; "not much uv a father, but
                  he wuz the only one I ever hed." "I mourn a husband," sed the mother uv the first
                  speaker, "not legally a husband, but morally, or rather, immorally." "We weep,"
                  sed all these various shades in korus, and they bustid out into a torrent uv greef
                  wich completely extinguished them on the tother side uv the grave, wich hed the
                  legle rite to mourn.</p>
               <p>Ez a matter uv coarse, it ended in a row. Issaker<pb n="156-157"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000082"/> ker Gavitt swore that no cussid bleached niggers
                  shood shed teers at his father's funeral; and Amandy flew at a quadroon wich wuz
                  cryin too prominently, and Mrs. Gavitt attacked the quadroon's mother who wuz
                  displayin altogether too much white pockit hankercher. In the melee I left,
                  satisfied that Democrisy hez altogether too many rough pints to git over
                  pleasant.</p>
               <p>I feel it my dooty to erect a monument to the memory uv this good and true
                  man—this martyr to Democrisy. Demokrats, feelin an interest in the matter, and
                  wishin to contribute to the work, may send by mail sich donashens ez they see fit,
                  to me, with perfect confidence that they will be yoosed. Let em remember that but
                  for his devoshen to the coz he wood hev bin livin to-day. Ef we cannot do much for
                  the livin, let us not forgit the dead.</p>

               <p>IN castin a retrospective glance backerd over the pathway uv the past, I kin see
                  many mistakes wich I hev made. I hevn't alluz made the most uv opportoonities—I
                  hev doubtid when doubtin wuz a crime, and I hev stood shivrin on the brink and
                  feared to lanch away, when on the tother side uv the Jordan wuz pelf and profit.
                  Our foresite isn't alluz ez good ez our hind-site. The great error uv my life wuz
                  in not plungin headlong into the war ez a Confedrit Major-General, distinguishin
                  myself for crooelty to Fedral prizners, and bein, at the close uv the fratrisidle
                  struggle, reseeved and embraced ez a long-lost brother by the Northern people
                  (lettin em kill fattid calves for me), and uv coorse bein the objeck uv sympathy
                  ez a marter by the Southern people. In this sitooashen a man hez<pb n="158-159"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000083"/> two strings to his bow. He brings to his support
                  the two extremes. He fetches together Horris Greely from the one side, and General
                  Boregard from the t'other—they embrace, and standin onto both their sholders, he
                  hez wat may be called a soft thing uv it.</p>
               <p>I wuz led into these train uv reflections by the experience I hev hed with our
                  sainted cheef, Jefferson Davis. I wuz sent hither by the President to see that
                  everythin wuz done for the comfort uv the illustrious man that cood be done, on
                  the occasion uv his contemplatid trip to Richmond. Partikelerly I wuz charged to
                  see that everything calkelatid to jar onto his sensitive feelins be
                  removed—every-thin wich cood wound his sense uv hearin, seein, or smellin.</p>
               <p>The grate man had consentid to go. He hed bin, he felt, illegally deprived uv
                  liberty—unconstooshnelly in fact—and ef he shood consult his own feelings he wood
                  remane; but to forgive wuz divine. Viewin these perceedins in the lite uv an
                  apology, he wood go.</p>
               <p>The day hed arrived. The steamer wuz at the Fortress carefully prepared to receive
                  its illustrious burden. It hed been thoroughly cleaned and fumigated, the cabins
                  hed bin nooly furnisht, and speshel alterashens made for the President and party.
                  Ther wuz Yoonited States officers and soljers aboard; but out of respeck for the
                  feelins uv their illustrious "prizner," ez he is technically called, they kept
                  theirselves carefully out of his site, that the color uv their uniforms might not
                  awaken onpleasant refleckshens. So perfeck, indeed, wuz the arrangements, that the
                  railin uv the boat, which wuz originelly bloo, wuz kivered with gray cloth, and
                  the eagle figger-head uv the craft wuz sawed off. This wuz sejested by a eminent
                  Conservative uv Noo York, who hez a large Southern trade wich he didn't prejoodis
                  by his course doorin the war. The ladies' cabin wuz originelly assigned to the
                  party; but a female passenger hed no more regard for the comfort uv the marter
                  than to die on the passage, an they were deprived uv it. The Conservative merchant
                  insisted that the corpse be chucked overboard; but Mr. Davis, with a magnanimity
                  wich wuz alluz characteristic uv him, refoozed. "No," said he, "let her rest
                  there. I kin endoor the inconvenience, severe as it is. It is but one more attempt
                  to break my sperit."</p>
               <p>All the way up there wuz the most tetchin deference shown him. At every landin the
                  people were assembled to greet him, wich he acknowledged<pb n="160-161"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000084"/> edged with a condesenshen I never saw off the
                  stage. He conversed but little on the passage up. Ez the boat was a sweepin
                  majestically past pints made historicle by the events uv the great struggle, his
                  eye wood brighten, ef they wuz sich pints ez a Confedrit cood take pride in, and
                  dim with teers ef they wuz pints at wich ther had bin reverses.</p>
               <p>The most considrit preparashens hed bin made for his resepshen. Ther wuz no irons
                  onto him: the only guards in site wuz them wich wuz detailed to keep the crowd
                  from annoyin him, and a carriage wuz in readiness, into wich we seated ourselves,
                  and wuz driven off at a dignified pace to that resort uv the aristocracy uv
                  Virginny—the Spottswood. Here, more considerashen wuz shown. Mr. Davis being
                  averse to walkin up stairs, a suite uv rooms hed bin prepared for him on the fust
                  floor, and the presence uv General Burton, uv the Federal army, bein obnoxshus, he
                  wuz assigned by the Ex-President a room at the further end uv the corridor. His
                  nerves bein very sensitive, heavy mattin wuz laid down in all the halls, and the
                  servants uv the house wuz especially directed to wear list slippers, and to walk
                  on their tip toes.</p>
               <p>I wuz invited to his room, and wuz favored with a few minutes' conversashen with
                  the first of Amerikens kens. Glancin out uv the winder, his fine, soft, gray eyes
                  restid on the roof uv Libby. "Lies! lies!" sed he, angrily.</p>
               <p>"What speshel lies hev yoo reference to?" askt I.</p>
               <p>"Them wich wuz publisht in the scurrillous reports uv the Committees uv a
                  unconstooshnel Congris regardin the treatment uv prizners in Libby. They asserted
                  that the officers died becoz they hed but ten feet by two for sleepin, washin,
                  cookin, and eatin. They hed that space, and wat more wuz necessary? Why give 'em
                  room to cook when they hedn't anythin to cook? Wherefore room to eat ef they
                  hedn't anythin to eat? No, its false. It wuzn't the crowdin that perdoost the
                  mortality."</p>
               <p>Only wunst wuz his buzzum wrung, and that the Government cood not pervent. He wuz
                  a standin at the winder, gazin out upon Richmond, his mind revertin to the time
                  when it wuz the Capital uv his Confedracy, when a procession passed with moosic,
                  and flags, and banners. With a shreek uv anguish he buried his head in the
                  curtins, and wept aloud. I rusht to the winder. It wuz ez I feared. Filin slowly
                  by wuz a percession uv niggers who hed past that way perposely. "Merciful Heaven!"
                  sed he, "hez it come to this?" and he wuz very reserved and deprest the balence uv
                  the day.</p>
               <pb n="162" xml:id="VAC7103-00000085"/>
               <p>The next day the President wuz taken to the Court. Ez he entered the room, and
                  glanced proudly over the awjence, it wood hev bin very difficult to hev decided
                  whether he wuz a goin to try the Court or the Court him. But repressin hisself he
                  took his seat. Techin solissitood wuz displayed in the Court Room for his comfort.
                  A crack in the winder-casin let in a draft uv cold air; he shuddered, and a
                  shudder run thro the entire assemblage. The shudder uv the Conservative merchant
                  from Noo York wuz trooly artistic. Cotton wuz called for, when the Conservative
                  merchant's wife tore off one uv her buzzums and stufft the apertoor. Wuz ther ever
                  more techin sacrifis? The President wept ez he beheld it. On assertainin the
                  temperatoor wich best sootid his system, a thermometer wuz brot, and the room wuz
                  kept at that precise degree.</p>
               <p>There wuz sum triflin legal formalities gone through with, and the President's
                  counsel made a motion that he be admitted to bail. There wuz a stir in the Court.
                  "Make it a million!" sed one, "so that the craven North shel see how we kin take
                  keer uv them we love!" But Judge Underwood fixed it at $100,000, and, brisk ez

               <p>"Three cheers for Jeff'son Greely and Horris Davis—one and inseprable, now and
                  forever!" shoutid one enthoosiastic confedrit.</p>
               <p>"Immortality is yoors!" sed another, seezin him by the hand corjelly. "Jeff'son
                  Davis is the big dog uv the age, and yoo, my deer sir, are now the tin kittle tied
                  to his tale! Wat joy! Wat happinis! When posterity speeks uv Him, they'll speek uv
                  Yoo!"</p>
               <p>I coodent restrane myself no more. Bustin into teers, I fell onto Greeley's
                  buzzum, and we embraced. Ez he hedn't his spekticles on, he sposed it wuz Davis
                  hisself, and he bustid into teers also, and there wuz wun uv the most strikin
                  tabloos ever exhibited. I got away afore he diskivered his mistake.</p>
               <p>Here wuz the endin uv our troubles—the consummashen uv our hopes. Davis wuz free!
                  The pent-up emoshens uv the people found vent. Ez he stept into the street the
                  people crowded to the carriage wich contained us, and rent the air with cheers. We
                  reacht the hotel, and after embracin his wife,<pb n="164-165"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000087"/> a season of religious exercises wuz held. The
                  clergyman who hed excloosive charge of Davis's piety doorin the war wuz present,
                  and he offered prayer. He prayed fervently that the Lord wood forgive the people
                  of the North for the wrong they hed done our sainted head; that he wood forgiv, ef
                  possible, the late head uv the Fedral Government who hed opposed him and the
                  glorious coz; and ef Divine mercy could stretch so far, that he wood forgive the
                  Colonel uv Michigan cavalry wich hed hunted down the Saint who wuz now in our
                  midst, and made uv him a captive. He prayed for forgiveness for the reckless men
                  of the North who invaded Virginny; for the noosepaper condukters who had aboozed
                  him who is now with us, and particklerly Horris Greely, who hed this day, in some
                  measure, atoned for his previous wickidness. He prayed that the blessins uv Heven
                  might rest, first, upon the city uv Richmond, then upon the balance uv Virginny,
                  and afterward upon the rest uv the Southern States; and he wound up with a fervent
                  appeal that the Ethiopians, wich coodent change their skins, might see the error
                  of their ways, and return to their normal condishen.</p>
               <p>After this the President received his friends.</p>
               <p>I am not permitted to give more uv the President's dent's plans than this: He will
                  remain in secloosion, and will take no part watever in politics until after his
                  final acquittal in November. He don't feel at liberty to take hold uv the
                  Government, so long ez ther is even a technikle charge agin him. Our friends in
                  the Northern States, who expected him to take the stump in their behalf this fall,
                  will be disappintid. I return to-morrer to Kentucky.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THE undersined, yoor ardent admirers, who follerd willinly yoor lead in the late
                  tour the South took for addishnel rites, wich unfortnitely resultid in the loss uv
                  sich uv em ez we had, beg leave to tender yoo, ez a testimony uv their esteem, the
                  Presidency uv the Ham and Japheth Academy for the Development uv the Intellek uv
                  all Races, "irrespective uv race or color," uv wich I hev the honor to be one uv
                  the Fakulty.</p>
               <p>We worshipt yoo, before your untimely capcher in female apparel, for the dignity
                  with which you bore yourself doorin your prosperous days, your manliness doorin
                  yoor long and unconstitooshnel incarcerashen in a Fedral bastile, and your hawty
                  though silent assershen uv the natral sooperiority of the Southern man doorin the
                  annoyin perceedings wich endid in yoor triumfant release from yoor abasht
                  persecooters, and we feel confident that in yoor hands the interests uv the
                  Institoot will be entirely safe.</p>
               <p>Many reasons impel us to this course.</p>
               <p>First. We assoom that yoo are poor in this world's goods. Troo, yoo hed oceans uv
                  money passin thro the Treasury doorin the fratrisidle struggle forced onto us by
                  the North; but wat chance hed yoo for steelin, with Benjamin and Mallory, and them
                  fellows with yoo, who hed the benefit uv practice doorin Pierce and Bookannon's
                  administrations? A man coodent make day's wages peculatin in a Treasury wich them
                  men hed gone through.</p>
               <p>Second. Yoo wood be uv benefit to us. With yoor name at the head uv our Faculty,
                  the Northern Democracy would shell out their stamps with a libralty never before
                  witnest, and the Institoot wood be endowed heftier than any similar institooshen
                  in the country. The King's name is a tower uv<pb n="168-169"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000089"/> strength. Remember that the Democrisy uv the North
                  giv the exil Vallandigum $30,000 in ten cent contribooshens. Ef they'd do that for
                  him, and sich, wat woodent they doo for yoo? The greater swallers up the less.
                  There never will be sich a favorable opportunity for yoo to become a ten center,
                  wich is trooly equivalent to bein a hed center.</p>
               <p>Ez a matter uv coorse yoo will hev objeckshuns. Knowin wat they will be, we anser
                  em in advance.</p>
               <p>1. The incomplete state uv the Institoot. We acknowledge that it isn't in sich a
                  state uv completidnis as we cood desire. Not to put too fine a pint onto it, it
                  ain't built at all. But the corner-stun is laid. There's a good deal in that. A
                  corner-stun is a good thing. The corner-stun uv the Institoot is laid. From the
                  laying of corner-stuns great results follow. President Johnson laid a corner-stun
                  at Chicago, and your release followed. He didn't get very far into the affeckshuns
                  uv the people North, but he got yoo out uv Fortress Monroe. Jist let us fling our
                  banner to the breeze with the name of "J. Davis" onto it, and how quickly wood the
                  means to finish the Institoot be forthcomin! Ah, indeed! Ther wood be tournaments
                  held all over the South in its behalf. The Knite uv the Sore Eyes would tilt agin
                  the Knite of the Cropped Ears; the Knite uv the Bandy Legs would run a course and
                  be glorified agin the Knite uv the Released Cheef, for its benefit, and the Queens
                  uv Love and Beauty wood bid em, more fervently than ever before, to lay their
                  fish-poles in rest and run their course at the Injy Rubber Teething Rings, and do
                  their devours manfully, in sich a cause. Ther wood be fairs held in Noo York for
                  this fund, and C. Chancey Burr and Henry Clay Dean wood deliver lekters all over
                  the North in its behalf, workin a double benefit, viz., affordin us a little
                  money, Burr, clean paper-collars, and Dean, clean socks. In fact, the coz uv the
                  ill success the Institoot hez met with thus far, may be found in the fact that
                  ther hain't bin nobody connected with it but me. The Southern Democrisy don't take
                  to me kindly coz they see me every day; the Northern Democrisy hev no confidence
                  in me becoz they know I wuz originelly one uv em.</p>
               <p>2. Its name, indicatin ez it does, that the institooshen admits the ijee of Nigger
                  Ekality. This objeckshen kin be easily ansered. The name wuz, originelly, the
                  "Southern Military and Classikle Institoot," and the title expressed fairly its
                  objects. That's it yet, and nothin shorter. The change of<pb n="170-171"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000090"/> title was strategy. That change wuz Pickwickian, in
                  the most comprehensive meanin of the word. It wuz done for effeck upon the
                  Ethiopian. They hev votes in the States which supported yoo in your effort to
                  perpetuate em reliably in their normal condition, and it wuz deemed necessary to
                  conciliate em. I need not say wat a trial it wuz for our people to forego the
                  ecstatic delite uv wallopin uv em, and wat agony it wuz to be forced, by
                  circumstances over wich we hed litrally no controle, to recognize em, even in fun,
                  ez ekals, but we hed to do it. After they hev voted wunst, and boostid us into
                  Congress, it is eggstremely probable that a change will come over the sperit uv
                  their dreems. After that happy day—Well, State Legislachers hev yit powers, and
                  States hev yit rites. In breef, this nigger biznis is an effort to flank John
                  Brown's sole, which hez bin marchin on for sevral years. You hev witnist, no
                  doubt, in your gayer moments, the sole-inspirin and elevatin performances of
                  nigger minstrels. Certainly. On the stage they resembled niggers; after the play
                  wuz over, the curtain dropped, they washed off the cork, and went and took their
                  well-earned nips ez white men. Precisely so. When this little play is over,
                  probably we may wash off the cork, and ez Caucashens shens assert our rite to be,
                  as uv old, the governin class.</p>
               <p>3. Pay. On this hed nothin definit kin be statid. Yoo must doo ez I hev done—hev
                  faith, and take wat comes. I hev hed contribooshens ez low ez ten cents, and that
                  even in counterfeit postal currency, wich wuz no objeckshen to it down here, ez
                  among our people it passes just ez well ez any. I hev lived on it for some time;
                  the Institoot hez eked out the livin afforded me by the offis I hold from the
                  Guvernment. Ef contribooshens should be insufficient for yoor support, after my
                  livin is taken out, wat uv it? Is Johnson dead, and does Wade reign in his stead?
                  Do yoo hev any idee that he wood let yoo suffer? Is ther not a sinecoor for yoo ez
                  well ez for me? Is ther a Confedrit officer, who wood accept it, who is not
                  pervided with a posishen uv some kind? Hevin pervided generously for every one uv
                  the principal sufferers in the late fratrisidal struggle on the Confedrit side, is
                  it probable that he wood make yoo an excepshen?</p>
               <p>I hev ansered all the objections to the place wich yoo kin urge, and I beg leave
                  to state some uv the reasons why you shood accept.</p>
               <p>A full year intervenes before the meetin uv the<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000091"/> Democratic Nashnel Convenshen, and two before you
                  kin be finally inoggerated. Pendin that event yoo must go into dignified
                  retirement. It's the regler thing. Forrest did it, and he succeeded so well in
                  masterin his nateral proclivities that, ef I remember ritely, he hez killed but
                  two niggers sence he reverently folded up the stars and bars. Longstreet hez did
                  it, Price hez did it, and so hez all uv em. Lee hez done it better than any uv em.
                  There's suthin pecoolyerly fittin in the cheeftain uv an unsuccessful "rebellion,"
                  ez the Northerners call our struggle for our rites, takin the Presidency uv a
                  college, in seekin shelter in academic groves, in trainin the noble young men uv
                  his seckshen, and instillin into em a more perfeck knowledge uv the doctrin uv
                  State rites and a higher revrens for Virginny, a deeper hatrid of ablishnism (wich
                  is all that a Southern yooth hez a call to know), and a gittin rifled cannon from
                  a tyranikle government to teech em artillery practis. That's the dodge for yoo. We
                  hain't got the academic grove for yoo to walk pensively in at the twilite hour, a
                  musin onto the eventful past, but we kin easily move that corner-stun into one.
                  That corner-stun is ez easily shifted ez Democracy.</p>
               <p>There's another reason why yoo shood do it. The edjucashnel interests uv the South
                  shood be entrusted to them ez knows how to manage em, and who to edjucate. We
                  don't want it too common. It's too much power. I know the power ther is in it. I'm
                  about the only one here who kin rite—were ther more, it wood hurt my standin.</p>
               <p>Look at wat miscellaneous education hez done for the North! Noo England is a cloud
                  bustin with educashen. That black cloud hez swept over the North, and all over
                  that country its drops hev fell in the shape uv schools, academies, and colleges,
                  and sich. Consekently, there's no Democracy ther; and the heavier the shower a
                  locality received the less Democracy there is. In yoor hands it wood be safe.
                  Niggers woodent git it, nor poor whites; but the sons uv the chivalry, uv the
                  dominant race, they alone wood tread the flowery path with yoo.</p>
               <p>We heven't the society at the Cross Roads in wich yoo hev bin accustomed to move,
                  but wat uv that? Let it be known what yoo are, and the Democrisy uv the North will
                  make this a place uv summer resort, and of winter recreashen. This will be their
                  Mecca—yours will be the shrine at which they will come and worship.</p>
               <p>Then come. To yoo the Cross Roads opens her arms, and offers her bosom for yoo to
                  repose onto.<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7103-00000092"/> Come! Erect here yoor

               <p>THE Corners wuz in a most pleasant frame uv mind last Friday nite. So important a
                  event ez the release uv our saintid Davis cood not be allowed to go by without
                  commemoratin, and we accordingly commemoratid. The rejoicins wuz held at the
                  Church, tho they commenst at Bascom's. Ez the heftiest part uv the rejoicin hed
                  bin done at Bascom's, taperin off, ez I may say, at the Church, the speeches were
                  very short, ef not to the pint. When, how, or wher it adjourned, I know not. I
                  wandered orf into the realms uv Morphus in the middle uv Deekin Pogram's sekondly,
                  and afore I got back I hed taken a rather long journey.</p>
               <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7103-00000093"/>
               <p>I dreamed a very curis dream. Methawt I wuz in the regions that are populerly
                  supposed to lay below us. Onto his burnin throne sot Lucifer a reading the Noo
                  York Triboon, with the most puzzled expression onto his face I ever witnest.
                  Laying it down with a sigh, ez tho he hed gone bumpin onto a stunner wich he cood
                  not comprehend, he remarkt, sadly, "To biznis!" and demandid uv his book-keeper
                  the sitooashen of things. Reports were read to him, wich, in the main, pleased
                  him. A shade uv sadniss becloudid his classikle countenance ez the statement that
                  Napoleon and Bizmark hed made up, but his face illuminatid serenely ez it was
                  statid that the Christian nashens hed decidid to let the Turks go on a butcherin
                  the Cretans, wich wuz replaced with a frown agin when he wuz informed that there
                  wuz a prospeck uv the English common people gettin a vote. After goin thro the
                  rest uv the world, the United States come in.</p>
               <p>"Kentucky," sed the book-keeper, lookin over a bundle uv fresh reports, "is all
                  rite. Helm is electid Governor by a whackin majority, and McKee and Rice is
                  defeetid."</p>
               <p>"Good!" sed he, fetching his tail down in a ecstasy uv joy. "The next time I swing
                  around the cirkle I must visit Kentucky. No State does so well for me with so
                  little uv my assistance. I alluz like to visit Kentucky. Noo York city is ruther
                  pleasant, tho it's so near like my own place that I don't enjoy it much when I'm
                  there. I don't feel ez tho I'm away from home a visitin. But Kentucky I love—the
                  people reely charm me. But go on, wat next?"</p>
               <p>"Jeff'son Davis hez bin liberatid by Horris Greeley becomin his bale. This balein
                  by Greeley, the reporter stashened at Washington considers a most momenchus event,
                  and a most happy okkurrence for yoor majesty."</p>
               <p>"That reporter's a ass, and don't know the secret springs wich actooate men.
                  Recall him towunst for making sich a foolish remark."</p>
               <p>"But," sed the Sekretary, who seemed to me to be a imp uv some consekence, to be
                  permitted to argoo with Lucifer hisself, "I consider it uv importance. Did yoo
                  wish Jeff'son Davis to die in prizen?"</p>
               <p>"Ef yoo wuzn't uv desided yoose to me, hevin bin a Noo York Alderman, I'd redoose
                  yoo. Want Jeff'son Davis to die? Not I. I'm not the yooth wot killed the goose wot
                  laid the golden egg. He's bin the best recrootin lootenant I ever hed.<pb
                     n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7103-00000094"/> He hez the happy knack uv controllin
                  everybody he hez anythin to do with, and he turns em all to'ard me. He rooined
                  Polk, he swampt Pierce, he sedoost Bookannon, he dazzled Johnson, and he hez now
                  caught Horris Greeley. But ther wuzn't any danger uv his dyin in prizen. Men ain't
                  in the habit uv dyin on panned oysters, briled beefsteak, and milk toast; they hev
                  a trick uv peggin out faster on diet suthin the opposite uv that; for instance,
                  the variety that Jeff'son furnished em at Andersonville. He wood hev got out any
                  how. Johnson is, after all, a poor white man, and he cood bully them uv that class
                  well enuff; but he felt ashamed uv keeping a real gentleman like Davis in prizen,
                  and he wood hev releast him."</p>
               <p>"Shel I put Horris down on our books?" askt the Sekretary, eagerly, dipping his
                  pen into bloo flame ez Hertzog does in the Black Crook.</p>
               <p>"Let us consider!" sed Lucifer, musinly. "Wat hez he did?"</p>
               <p>"Bailed Jeff'son Davis!" returned the Sekretary, confidently, givin his pen a
                  fresh dip.</p>
               <p>"Very good. Horris hez made uv hisself, to speak figgeratively, a post for a drove
                  uv hogs to scratch themselves agin. They are scramblin out uv the slough uv
                  secession in wich they wallered till the droppin out uv the bottom made it
                  dangerous; they find Horris a standin on the bank, and agin him they rub their
                  sides to clean off the mud wich adheres. I speak figgeratively in likenin Horris
                  to a post; literally in likenin the secesh to swine. They wuz jest ez senseless
                  and jest ez crooel. They wuz the wuns afore wich pearls wuz cast.</p>
               <p>"I hev jest finisht his defence of hisself. It's a curious dokeyment, and puzzles
                  me. I'm disposed to consider him honest,—but wat a week showin he makes! First, he
                  sez he's honest, wich is alluz agin a man, for a trooly honest man kin alluz find
                  enuff others to say it for him. 2d. He tries to prove it, wich is very bad, for
                  the honesty wich needs provin is uv a rather scaly order. He instances his spilin
                  his chances for the Senit last fall by writin that universal amnesty letter.
                  Horris, in this matter, is, I fear, playin ostrich. He hez his hed in the sand,
                  and, bein blind hisself, fancies the balance uv his anatomikle strukter, wich
                  ought to be in the background, ain't visible to the rest uv mankind. Or, he is
                  reely a loonatic!</p>
               <p>"I never hed any idea that he wantid the seat in the Senit. He wuz in Congress
                  wunst, and the terrible failure he made ther wood, ef he wuz conscious<pb
                     n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7103-00000095"/> scious uv it, hev deterred him from
                  seekin that pertikeler place agin. Then, ef he wuz reely <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >compus mentus</foreign>, he wood hev knowd, or ought to hev knowd, that he
                  hedn't the ghost uv a chance for the place, and coodn't hev got it ef he hed
                  written a letter urgin the hangin of every rebel, from Jeff'son Davis down to
                  Commodore Hollins. It looks to me very much like ez ef Horris wuz playin the old
                  game uv declinin wat hed never bin offered him. His letter wuz soundin brass and
                  tinklin cymbals."</p>
               <p>"Shel I enter him or not?" askt the Sekretary.</p>
               <p>"It's a curis case," said Lucifer, not mindin him. "He hez bin agin me, by spasms,
                  and when he <unclear>hed</unclear> done things wich I could approve, I hev alluz,
                  so far, entered it up to the account uv loonacy; for I am pertikler about puttin
                  my claw onto any man who don't belong to me. I hev a clear rite to every one I
                  git. This last trick uv his staggers me! Kin it be that the old man wuz, all
                  along, opposin wrong and sich, not from any deep-seated dislike to the artikle,
                  but becoz opposin things wuz his best holt? Kin it be—hevin bin in the minority
                  all his life, and found therein profit because it so happened that the minority
                  wuz rite—that he is now anxious to git into that fix agin? Does Horris spose, that
                  hevin the strength uv a successful career to back him, and hevin a hundred
                  thousand more or less, who are in the habit uv readin him—the people will follow
                  him through the stinkin slums uv error jest ez lively ez they did over the breezy
                  hills uv trooth? Hez his vanity got the better uv his discretion at last? Hev the
                  hangers-on, wich alluz puff incense into the face uv success, been burnin hasheesh
                  afore him, and hez it intossicatid him? Is he, at his advanced age, in imitashen
                  uv Sut Lovin-good's daddy, goin to play hoss, forgittin the hornet's nest into
                  wich his great exemplar plunged?"</p>
               <p>"Shel I put him down or not?" askt the Sekretary agin, rather impatiently.</p>
               <p>"No!" replied Lucifer, drawin hisself up decisively. "Ef he splits up the
                  Ablishnists, we shel be so deep in his debt that he will deserve to git clear uv
                  us. Ez it is, he hez done enuff to entitle him to our gratitood. He hez restored
                  Jeff'son Davis to me; he hez even enlarged his field uv usefulnis. He is a
                  demonstratin the theory that there ain't no sich thing ez treason, and ez a matter
                  uv course, that there ain't bin no crime committed by my friend Davis's friends.
                  Ez Horris is establishin the fact that the war agin my friends in the South wuz
                  unjustifiable, I shoodent be surprised ef the<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000096"/> next thing he does, in order that justis may be
                  done, will be to insist that their niggers be returned to em. After all, I speckt
                  that's wat he's drivin at. Now that slavery's abolisht, I bleeve he'd like to hev
                  it restored, that he may hev suthin to do. His okkepashen's gone. He's short uv a
                  subjict now. His pen hez bin so used to writin slavery! slavery! slavery!—that
                  he's reely at sea now that he kin write it no more. He wants that joocy old sin
                  set up for him to batter at agin. He wants Lovejoy shot over agin, and bleedin
                  Kansas to be repeetid. Wat's a perfessional Reformer ef ther ain't nothin to
                  reform? Wat's a corn doctor in a country wher they wear big boots? No! let him go.
                  He's shoor uv punishment enuff any how. He's a Universlist, a doctrine the mistake
                  of wich he'll diskiver some day; but he's very likely to realize his ijee uv
                  punishment on earth, for Wendell Phillips is after him, and wat wuss can he
                  suffer? Set this last act uv his'n down ez honesty streakt with loonacy; or
                  ruther, the loonacy bein the biggest, ez loonacy streakt with honesty, and leave
                  him out—Go on with the reports. Where's Davis now? and particulerly, where's

                  than by layin corner-stuns? His father deceest in 1812, and it wuz time that this
                  dooty was attended to. Besides, at this crysis in the affairs of the country, with
                  Wilson and Kelly a snortin through the South, he felt it wood be a good thing to
                  show ourselves.</p>
               <p>Seward felt that it wuz well to go. Filial love wuz charmin. Shakspeer, who wuz ez
                  justly celebrated ez a dramatist ez one he cood menshun wuz for diplomatic
                  telegraffin, remarkt, "How sharper nor a serpent's tooth it is to hev a thankless
                  child,"—the truth of which he hed experienced, ez he hed been styled the father uv
                  the Republican party: but that wuz not to the pint. It is the dooty uv every son
                  to lay corner-stuns. In this case it wood, perhaps, hev been more creditable hed
                  it been dun fifty years ago; but wat difference is it? It is natral ez we are
                  about being gathered to our fathers, that we shood remember em. Besides, he hed a
                  little speech wich he felt he'd like to deliver. He wanted to bear testimony to
                  the patriotism uv the son uv Jacob Johnson—particularly to our colored brethren in
                  North Carliny, who hev bin listenin to Kelly and Wilson.</p>
               <p>Randall didn't bleeve in it at all. He made bold<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000098"/> to say that ez the deceast Johnson hed slept
                  without a corner-stun for fifty-five years, he'd manage to git along a while
                  longer. It wuz rather late in the day. He bleeved in feelin sorrowful over the
                  decease uv our relatives, but he didn't go much on doin it fiftyfive years after
                  date. It wuz too much like bustin into tears over the suffrins uv the last illness
                  uv yer wife's great grandmother. The speeches he didn't bleeve in at all. He hed
                  seen some uv it—he hed accompanied one toor uv the kind. He hed bin on it. He wuz
                  at Cleveland, at Indianapolis, and Springfield, Illinoy. He begged to be excoosed.
                  He didn't keer about tailin sich a kite agin. Ef the people uv the South shood
                  receive us ez corjelly ez the people uv the North did, he preferred to consult his
                  feelins and be absent. He wuz a sensitive plant, and disliked sum things. Ef his
                  memory served him rite, the demonstrashens coodent be considered flatterin. The
                  people didn't fling dead cats at us, but they did wuss. Ef they wuz cold, they wuz
                  rather too cold. Ef they wuz in a volatile humer, they wuz rather too lively. He
                  hed about made up his mind that it wuzn't uv any yoose to fite it out on that line
                  ef it took all summer. Success is a dooty; but when success is ez impossible ez
                  water in the great Sahara, wat's the yoose? Wherefore struggle? Let us go slow,
                  draw our salaries to the end uv our 'spective terms, and so live that wen the
                  summons comes to jine the innoomerable caravan that moves out uv Washington
                  to'ards their 'spective homes, we go not like the dusty slave at nite, wat's bet
                  his all on two pair, but soothed and sustained by wat we saved,—go like one who's
                  got the wherewithal to live. It wuz a source uv comfort to him to know that the
                  worst uv men wuz soon forgotten. Who ever speeks uv Tyler, or Peerce, or Bukanon,
                  now? Benedict Arnold is only spoken uv on Fourth uv Julys, and Judis Iskariot on
                  Sundays. It will be so with us in time, for wich thank the Lord.</p>
               <p>But it was determined to go, and I was sent to Rawly to find where the grave uv
                  the honored father of our honored President was reely locatid, and to make sich
                  other arrangements ez the eggsigencies uv the case demanded, wich I did. I hed
                  difficulty in locatin the grave, and ain't jest shoor that I found the right one.
                  The people uv Rawly wuz anxshus to hev it come off, ez trade was dull in the
                  retail line; and for fear that I wood report that the grave coodent be found, and
                  thus nip their budding hopes, they giv me the choice uv sum twelve<pb n="188-189"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000099"/> or fifteen. Selectin the most eligible, I made the
                  uther arrangements and returned.</p>
               <p>The eggscurzion contrasted very favorbly with the one we took last fall. The
                  people receeved uz at every stashen with the most affectin demonstrashuns uv luv.
                  "Johnson! Johnson! Johnson!" they yelled at each stopping-place, wich sounded
                  sweeter in his ears and mine than the damnable iterashun of "Grant! Grant! Grant!"
                  wich greetid us at every pint North. The President wuz sorry he hedn't takin Grant
                  with him, to show him that ef he wuz the most popular in sum localities, we hed
                  the hearts uv the people in uthers. But ther wuz drawbax to our enjoyment. No
                  sooner wood the President commence, "Fellow-citizens!" than Randall wood pull the
                  bell-rope, and off the trane wood start. He wuz determined that the President
                  shouldent speek, wich put me to a grate deal uv trouble, ez after we arrived I hed
                  to write out and telegraph to the papers the speeches the President wood hev
                  made.</p>
               <p>At Rawley, General Battles welcomed the Presidential party, and the President
                  responded. He remarked that in Rawley he first opened his tender eyes, a penniless
                  boy. Here is the scenes uv his childhood; here is everything to bind man to his
                  fellow, and to associate him with that with wich he is associated; here is where
                  the tenderness uv heart hev taken holt upon everything to wich it hez attached
                  itself. But he was wandrin from his subjick. His mind went back to the day he left
                  this city a penniless boy. Where is them wich he left behind him? He begged to
                  inquire where is the scenes uv his childhood? Where's the Haywoods?</p>
               <p>"Killed at Antietam!" shouted a returned Confedrit. "I wuz by William's side when
                  he wuz shot."</p>
               <p>"Where is the Hunters?"</p>
               <p>"Running a distillery at Waxhall Court 'ouse," sed this same fellow, who thot the
                  President really wantid to know. He wuz choked down, and the President
                  proceeded:—</p>
               <p>"Wher is the Roysters and the Smithses, the Brownses and the Joneses? Wher is the
                  long list of men that lived at that day, and who, like me, command respeck for
                  constancy of devoshen? I feel proud of this demonstrashen—I feel proud of any
                  demonstrashen. Ez alloosion hez bin made to my boyhood days, when I wuz a
                  penniless boy, I may say here, ez pertinent to that subjeck, that I hev adhered to
                  the fundamental principles uv the gov'ment, and to the flag and Constooshen.
                     But<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7103-00000100"/> to return to my subjeck. When I
                  went out from among yoo a penniless boy, I adoptid the Constoo-shen ez my guide,
                  and by them I have allus bin guided. To the young I would say that they will be
                  safe in takin me ez a model. Leavin here a penniless boy, it is not for me to say
                  whether or not I hev succeeded. I am no longer a penniless boy, nor is them wich
                  are round me. Mrs. Cobb ain't a penniless boy; nor is—But this is a wanderin from
                  the subjeck. For the encouragement uv the young men afore me, I wood say, that I
                  hev enjoyed all I care about. I am no aspirant for nothing, and therefore the way
                  I now open for em. All places uv honor is now before em. I thank you for this
                  corjel welcom. North Caroliny sent me out a penniless boy, and did not afford me
                  sich advantages ez, considerin my merits, I ought to hev hed; yet I luv her. It's
                  better ez it wuz. Goin out a penniless boy, and returnin after holdin every offis,
                  from Alderman uv my adoptid village up to President, shows my qualities to much
                  better advantage than ef I hedn't gone out a penniless boy. I thank you for this
                  tribute to my many good qualities."</p>
               <p>And he startid to go down, when Randall whispered suthin in his left ear.</p>
               <p>Risin promptly, and drawin out his hankerchief, the President assoomed a look uv
                  subdood greef, and resoomed.</p>
               <p>"I hev come among yoo to participate in the dedicashen uv a monument to a man
                  which yoo all loved, tho it hez taken suthin like fifty yeers for yoo to diskiver
                  it. He wuz poor and humble, wich akkounts for my goin from among yoo a penniless
                  boy; but uv him I am proud,—for hed it not been for him, I woodent hev returned
                  the shinin example to yoor young men wich I am."</p>
               <p>The corner-stun wuz laid, and the monument set on it. It is uv red limestone, ten
                  foot high. It's ez good a ten foot uv stun respeck ez there is in North Carliny.
                  Ez the monument was elevatid, there wuz the appropriate speeches, and then my
                  little arrangements cum in. A nigger woman I hed took with us from Washington
                  rushed for'ard, and sed, "Bress de Lord, I'ze bin a waitin for dis day to see de
                  President,—OUR President!" at which a squad of niggers I'd picked up and drilled,
                  hollered "'Ror!"</p>
               <p>This little affectin sceen over, two quadroons, wich I'd also bro't with us in a
                  privit car, cum for'ard with a expression of profound greef, at wich the President
                  wept, and tenderly slung bokays uv<pb n="192 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000101"/> the choicest flowers we cood buy in Washington,
                  upon the tomb.</p>
               <p>It wuz reely a techin tabloo. The ancient nigger woman a holdin the President's
                  hand; the young quadroons a slingin the bokays; the President with his head bowed,
                  apparently a dreamin uv the days uv his boyhood; me with an expression uv
                  thankfulness that the niggers hed at last recognized their Moses; Seward with a
                  saintly smile on his face; Welles tryin to look ez near like Seward as possible
                  but failin miserably to look like anything but the eggrejis old ass he is, and
                  Randall with his handkercher to his eyes ez ef onmanned by the movin sceen, but
                  keepin one eye cocked over the handkercher to see how it took among the niggers.
                  It wuz a sceen easier to be imagined than described.</p>
               <p>Ther wuz several incidents which occurred wich did not appear in the telegraph.
                  When his Excellency wuz speekin uv himself, and remarkt that his race wuz nearly
                  run, a unregenerated nigger yelled out "Tank de Lord!" And when the quadroons wuz
                  a strewin flowers on the grave uv His Excellency's father, I observed rather more
                  titterin among the niggers than I approved uv on so sollum an occasion. I askt
                  Randall what he thought of the<figure>

                  pay!" struck me ez havin a vane uv trooth running through it.</p>
               <p>On our return, the President wuz allowed to speek more, for Randall got tired of
                  watching him. We returned in good health, and some uv us in good spirits. Seward
                  feels well, for he hez an abidin faith that the mere showin uv hisself alluz hez
                  an effeck for good upon the people, and ez a matter uv course Seckretary Welles

               <p>THE Raleigh trip scarcely over, His Serene Highness determined upon acceptin the
                  Boston invitashen. His corjel recepshen in North Karliny give him a sort uv
                  appetite for popler applause, and he determined upon tryin it in the North agin.
                  At the Cabinet meetin held to discuss the question, Seward expressed a desire to
                  go. Welles follered Seward; but Randall, who, sence the decease of Sir Isik
                  Newton, is considered the strongest man connected with the Administrashen, and
                  therefore assooms diktatorial airs, opposed it.</p>
               <p>"But," sed Johnson, "I feel ez though I must make one more effort to save our

                  telegraff em,—and in Connecticut yoor certain uv a corjel resepshen. That State is
                  full uv demoralized Yankee Dimocrats, who hev bin out to Michigan, and left there
                  all ther Puritanism, bringin back with em, in its stead, all the cussidnis
                  indigenous to that soil, wich cussidness, grafted onto ther natral cutenis, makes
                  em rather enterprisin in ther worthlisnis. In Boston itself, the prospeck is good.
                  There'll be a immense crowd present to dedicate the Masonik Temple, wich we shell
                  claim the credit uv bringin, ez we did the throngs which come to see us on the

                  Boston are Ablishnists; but there's some thousands wich want offices, and them,
                  with a sprinklin uv Demokrats and Conservatives, ought to make us a handsome
                  recepshen. There is yet men in Boston who used to return fugitive slaves, and ther
                  is besides the eminently respectable gentlemen who are so conservative that they
                  hold onto sin becoz it's old and established by precedent, and so aristocratic
                  that they won't do right, jist becoz doin rite is a quite common thing in that
                  secksun; who hold onto the cote-tale uv progress, and holler 'Stop!' and who, ef
                  they tie theirselves to a good cause, load it down with their dignity. Like the 2d
                  Lootenants uv '6I, their baggage is worth mor'n they are. But the trip won't hurt
                  us. You can't make the Ablishnists more Ablishn, and them ez foller us for the
                  loaves and fishes we dispense, wood still foller us, ef the road we took led ez

                  yoo locked in the arms uv Wen-dell Phillips. Ef they commence pityin you, the

                  this time. And then ef yoo make this toor, and say nothing ideotik, the very
                  novelty uv it will direct attention from wat we've desided to do with Sheridan,
                  Sickles, Pope, et al. It will bewilder the people."</p>
               <p>And so it wuz desided to go. Thro Delaware the resepshens wuz all that we desired,
                  and in Maryland the people come in crowds to greet us; tho the cheers partook so
                  much uv the nacher uv the cheerful yells wich the Confedrit soljers employed when
                  they charged, that Sekretary Seward's nerves wuz somewat shockt. Ez Philadelphy
                  didn't offer us the hospitalities uv the city, we didn't stop ther at all. The
                  train run around it, the President's nose bein elevatid all the time ez tho he
                  smelt suthin. When it had finally passed, Mr. Randall announst the fact, and the
                  Presidenshel face assoomed its yoosual benine expression ez we glided into the
                  sacred soil uv Noo Gersey.</p>
               <p>In Noo York, Morrissy hed done his part. Ther wuz spectable bodies uv cheerers at
                  the pints agreed upon, and, ez they hed bin paid librally, the spontaneous
                  enthoosiasm wuz ez good in quality ez it wuz large in quantity. Occasionally a
                  cheerer, wich hed taken too much uv his wages in advance, wood yell for Jeff'son
                  Davis, but it wuzn't notist. It didn't mar the pleasant uniformity uv the
                  proceedins, or strike anybody ez bein singler. They tried terrible hard to get a
                  speech out uv us, and the President wuz willin; but Randall, seein that the Herald
                  and Triboon hed reporters present, supprest him, and got him off to bed
                  comparatively sober, and very early.</p>
               <p>Arrivin at Boston, I wuz surprized at the length, depth, and breadth uv the
                  enthoosiasm wich greeted us. Ez ef to show ther greef at the death uv Presidents,
                  we notist everywhere the portraits of our predecessor, Linkin, draped in mournin,
                  at wich the President dropt a tear, sayin, "See how they mourn us wen we're
                  everlastinly gone!" Ther wuz a sort uv subdood enthoosiasm, a kind uv half-mournin
                  gladnis, ef I may say so, wich wuz gratifyin.</p>
               <p>We wuz receeved by Gov'nor Bullock, whose speech wuz a noble triboot to the
                  President. "I welcome yoo," sed he, "to Massachoosits. Many Presidents hev visited
                  Noo England, and this visit, like theirn, excites devoshen to the Yoonion, and
                  respeck for them, wich, in their offishel posishen, respeck the government uv the
                  whole country. Our desire is to manifest our regard for those who, in offishel
                  capacity, respeck the Nashnel Yoonion,<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7103-00000106"/>
                  wich is to say, we respeck the Nashnel Yoonion. I trust the President will stay
                  long enuff to enable us to manifest our high regard for—(here the President's face
                  brightened up) YOOR OFFIS! (the President turned frightfully red, wich Bullock,
                  whose principles wuz a rasslin a back holt with his politeness, notist, and he
                  added)—AND TO YOO, PERSONALLY!"</p>
               <p>Ez them last words ishood slowly and despritly, the President's face lighted up.
                  He tendered him thanks for the resepshun. He woodent undertake to conceel emoshens
                  which agitated him at this personel welcome upon the soil uv Massachoosits. It
                  wuzn't necessary for him to go into the histry uv Massachoosets ez he wuz in the
                  habit uv doin further South, ez those afore him wuz probably ez familyer with it
                  ez he wuz; but he wood ashoor em, for their encouragement, that the histry uv
                  Massachoosits, in conneckshn with the histry uv these States, hez become a part uv
                  the histry uv the country; and therefore, in visitin Massachoosits under sich
                  pekoolyer circumstances, it is pekoolyerly gratifyin to receeve sich a welcome. In
                  regard to yoor remarks tetchin the preservashen uv these States, I trust I may say
                  without egotism, a vice wich I hev never bin accused uv, and from wich I may say
                  no one is more singlerly free than myself, I yield to no patriot, livin or dead,
                  in my devoshen, to that purpose. I dislike speekin, ez I kin trooly say that I am
                  not loquashus; but when trooth, wich I love, and the coz uv humanity, wich I tie
                  to, is at stake, I hev spoke. I may say, without egotism, that I live for
                  principle; and I thank the people uv Massachoosits, wich my visit hez drawd to
                  Boston, for the outburst uv regard wich greets me. Without egotism I may say, that
                  it's a outburst ekalled by few and excelled by none ever given a President in the
                  Yoonited States or elsewhere; and it is my prayer that comin in contact with me
                  will do the people uv Boston good. Yoor remarks, not referrin direckly to me, on
                  the Rooshn purchis, and a more economical collecshin uv the internal revenue, also
                  meets my corjel approbashen, lovin ez I do my common country."</p>
               <p>Randall pulled at his coat-tale, when the President remarkt that he might say,
                  without egotism, that he didn't desire to make a speech, and stopt. We brought him
                  off in comparatively good order.</p>
               <p>We stopt at the Tremont House. It is a good hotel, and the waiters are ez they
                  ought to be, niggers. It's soothin to a troo Dimekrat to be waited on by a nigger.
                  Yoo kin damn a nigger waiter,<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7103-00000107"/> but put a
                  white man in that posishen and yoo feel a delicacy about it. When we retired, the
                  President insisted that I shood sleep lyin across the doorway uv his room.</p>
               <p>"Why?" asked I.</p>
               <p>"I am in Boston," replied he, "wher they stun the prophets. Boston dislikes me.
                  Boston wears to-day a smilin face; but wot kind uv a hart does that smilin face
                  conceal? Sumner lives in Boston, and so does Phillips. In Boston they elect
                  niggers to the Legislacher, and are tryin to stop the sale uv whiskey. Wot kind uv
                  a place is that for a Dime-kratic President to trust hisself into? Yoo sleep
                  across my doorway, and ef a band uv Ablishnists, deemin me their foe, shood strive
                  to enter, they wood hev to first sheath their daggers in yoor body. Meanwhile I
                  wood escape, and continyoo to live for my lovd country. You cood, by preparin
                  beforehand a few impressive last words, make a gorjus death uv it, and do the coz
                  good. For instance, ez Sumner stuck yoo, yoo cood gasp, "Slay me, but spare A. J.,
                  the hope uv the Republic." Or, ez Wilson struck yoo down with a bludgeon, yoo mite
                  exclaim, "I die willinly for the Constitooshen with 36 stars onto it." Any little
                  quotashen from any uv my speeches, joodiciously throwd in under sich circumstances
                  cumstances, wood do good. Yoo will sleep ther to-night; and remember, in case you
                  are called upon to die, the proper quotashens."</p>
               <p>Seward concurred, but Randall objectid. He didn't anticipate any sich danger. Ef
                  Boston wants to git rid uv the President, they hev a shorter way than
                  assassinashen. Rash politishuns only assassinate them wich they can't find cause
                  to impeach. But he wuzn't afraid uv Boston. We stood a better chance uv dying of
                  excessive hospitality in Boston than uv bein stabbed. Our stomachs mite protrude
                  in Boston, but our bowels never. Boston wood feast us, for ther are enuff men in
                  Boston who want posishen to keep us a goin a year or two. He feared dyspepsia more
                  than daggers, and hed no fears uv the wine bein pizened.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, I wuz forst to sleep in that posishen, wich I did, wakin up in the
                  mornin ez sore and stiff ez a plow-hoss. I don't know how far the trip will be
                  extended.</p>

               <p>I HEV alluz hed an incorrect idea uv Boston. I sposed Boston to be strate-laced,
                  moral to a degree not to be understood by a Dimocrat, and Puritanicle. I wuz
                  mistaken. Ther is ez heavy a per cent. uv men in whom His Eggslency and I kin take
                  delite ez ther is in any city in the country, ez the followin incidents, which
                  came under my notice, will show:—</p>
               <p>Ez we wuz a goin through Franklin Street, a man stepped up to the carriage rather
                  hesitatinly.</p>
               <p>"Mr. President," sed he.</p>
               <p>"Well," sed His Eggslency, turnin full upon him.</p>
               <p>The site uv the nose uv the Step Father uv his Country reashured him.</p>
               <p>"Mr. President, wood yoo like some punch?"</p>
               <p>"Punch! Certainly. But hevn't yoo suthin stronger, to lay a foundashen with?"</p>
               <p>"Certinly!" and he pulled a bottle uv brandy from his right hind-pocket, and the
                  great man took an observashen uv the sky thro the bottom uv it, wich lasted a
                  minnit. I never agin will doubt that the material to make Democrisy uv exists in a
                  country where they come at yoo with punch, and hev brandy bottles in their
                  coat-pockets.</p>
               <p>Bokays were showered upon us. One old gentleman, who sot two hours in a chair
                  waitin to present us with his, finally histed it at us. The fact that ther wuz a
                  note in it askin fur a posishen fur the genrous giver, don't detract anything from
                  the valyoo uv the gift. When we got to the end uv our trip there wuz a dray-load
                  uv bokays in our carriage, and in all but three uv em wuz tied-up recommendashens
                  for the givers for places. It is better to hev sich missives enveloped in roses,
                  though the most thorns we git ain't got roses round em.</p>
               <p>The most techin incident was the number uv babies we hed to kiss. The mothers
                  pressed to our carriage-steps to present their offsprings. Mistakin<pb n="206-207"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000109"/> takin me for the President, I kisst half uv em. The
                  rapcherus expreshun on the upturned faces uv the anxshus mothers affected the
                  President to teers, showin, ez it did, the confidence reposed in him.</p>
               <p>"Whisht, Teddy!" sed one uv em, "and howld yer mug up fer the man to kiss who
                  doesn't kiss the dirthy nagers!"</p>
               <p>"Musha, Phelim, be still. The Presidint, bless his sowl, won't bite ye!"</p>
               <p>"Lind me yer apurn, Peggy, to wipe Terry's face wid. The Prisidint must kiss the

               <p>And the President kissed, and I kissed, till our lips wuz sore.</p>
               <p>Sich is position.</p>
               <p>That nite I received a letter from Deekin Pogram, in wich he desired me to
                  ascertain whether or no there wuz eny bottom to the Northern Dimocrisy. Captain
                  McPelter sed the Northern Dimocrisy wuz strong enuff to carry us uv Kentucky
                  throo, while Pollock, the Illinoyer, swore the Northern Dimocrisy hed a
                  considerable more to do to carry themselves than they hed bin able to accomplish
                  for some time—that in a pullin match a corpse wuzn't uv much akkount, ef it wuz a
                  big one. With this letter ter in my hand I fell asleep, and while asleep,
                  dreemed.</p>
               <p>Methawt I wuz in Noo Orleans at a gathrin uv the Faithful, who wuz called together
                  for the purpose of considrin wat to do. Sum few—Longstreet, Gov. Brown, and Jeff.
                  Thompson—wuz in favor uv submission, and hed got the majority uv the Southern
                  people to agree with em that ther wuz no yoose uv further resistance, and they wuz
                  jist about to so declare, when Vallandigham, Ben Wood, Toucey, Morrissey,
                  Voorhees, and a score or two more uv that kind, rushed in and begged uv em to hold
                  out. "Why submit?" sed Vallandigham. "We'll sustain yoo. The Northern Dimocrisy is
                  a giant wich kin yet pertect yoo. He's in his prime, and strong enuff yit to carry
                  yoo throo twice the troubles wich threatens yoo. Depend onto us—we'll carry
                  yoo."</p>
               <p>And the Southerners whopped over to their side and yelled fiercely, "No
                  submission!" and immejitly the entire bilin uv em startid North with these men, to
                  ascertain the strength and carryin capacity uv the Northern Dimocrisy. Methawt the
                  party travelled and travelled until finally they come to a vast plain in Kentucky,
                  onto wich wuz extendid prostrate the form uv a Giant. It was a Giant,<pb
                     n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7103-00000110"/> immense in statoo, but emaciated to the
                  last degree. His limbs hed bin strong, his teeth terrible, and his trunk massive;
                  but it wuz plane to see that he wuz pegged out, and a look at its face showed why
                  it wuz so. Dissipation had redoost him to helplessnis. His face wuz bloatid and
                  bloo, his eyes wuz sot and ghastly, his chest was holler and sunken, his legs like
                  pipe-stems, and ulcers, boils, sores, broozes, and contooshens kivered him from
                  head to foot, and he drawd his breath with a effort.</p>
               <p>He lay a groanin and a groanin. Randall wuz a tenderly feedin him out uv a huge
                  bottle, labelled "Appintments," which appeared to give him temprary strength; but
                  the effect of that wuz lost by President Johnson's dosin him with an offensiv
                  smellin mixter, labelled "Policy," every swaller uv wich wood throw him into a
                  spasm. Gov. English was rubbin one arm with a liniment Randall gave him, and hed
                  succeeded in gettin up a little circulation in it.</p>
               <p>"Wat is this?" askt the Southerners.</p>
               <p>"Northern Dimocrisy!" sed English, rubbin away vigrously.</p>
               <p>"Is this the Giant which is to carry us?" said the Southern gentlemen, viewin the
                  disgustin objick doubtfully.</p>
               <p>"Certainly!" sed Johnson. "Now can't you git up?" sed he to the prostrate bein,
                  givin it a very large swaller out uv his bottle. The Giant made an effort, but
                  flopped down agin like a dish-rag.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen!" said Vallandigham, "we shel hev to call upon you to assist in settin
                  him onto his feet, and then it'll be all rite with him. He's bin this way
                  afore."</p>
               <p>Accordingly, the Southerners gathered around him to lift him up. His arms, I
                  notist, wuz marked respectively Connecticut and Delaware, and his legs Maryland
                  and Kentucky, and in them there wuz strength, for ez soon ez the innocent
                  Southerners got near enuff he wrapped them limbs around em, and sed,—</p>
               <p>"Lift!"</p>
               <p>"We can't," sed they.</p>
               <p>"Yoo must," sed he; "I got into this condishen fightin yoor battles, and doin yoor
                  work. I was strong and vigorous until I got to runnin after yoor harlots; and for
                  yoor sake I wuz druv out uv my native States into this accussid region. Yoo must
                  carry me wat time I hev yet to live. Hist me! hist me!"</p>
               <p>Those caught coodent get away, and the others<pb n="210-211"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000111"/> generously come to ther aid, and makin a terrible
                  effort, they raised the half-dead bein onto their shoulders, holdin their noses
                  meanwhile, and prepared to start. Ez the percession wuz about to move,
                  Vallandigham remarked, "Stop a minit, gentlemen!" and loaded ez he wuz with his
                  war record, he clambered up ther shoulders and took a seat on the carkiss.
                  Voorhees, jist ez badly encumbered, did likewise, and so did the Woods, both uv
                  em, and poor Jimmy Bookannan, Seymour, Toucey, and a hundred or so more, the
                  unfortunit bearers sweatin under this addishnal load.</p>
               <p>"Is all ready?" sed they.</p>
               <p>"One moment!" sed Johnson, and him and Randall, and Seward, climbed up.</p>
               <p>This wuz the last feather. The bearers mite hev staggered off under the carkiss,
                  and them wich climbed onto it first, but this last addishn to ther burden wuz
                  friteful. It finisht em. Groanin under the weight, they swayed like a leaf in the
                  wind,—like a majestic tree jist about to fall. They struggled a minit to maintain
                  themselves—but all in vain. A breef struggle—a desprit gasp—they give up, and ther
                  knees doublin up, the whole concern come to the earth with a squashin sound, wich
                  letters can't express, and the half-decomposed mass sorter fell apart. Raymond and
                  Thurlow Weed, wich hed bin hangin round, got out from under jist in time to save
                  theirselves. The Southerners got out from under the putrid mass, tho almost
                  smothered by the stench. Vallandigham and that class made lite uv it, ez they had
                  bin around it. It staggered Johnson some, but he hed bin accustomed to suthin
                  approximatin very closely to it in the old times, and it didn't serously affect
                  him; but poor Randall, Seward, and Welles were smothered, and died.</p>
               <p>I wuz tryin to pull Randall's corpse out, when the effort I wuz makin awoke
                  me.</p>
               <p>I ain't altogether certain but that that dream means suthin. When I think of it,
                  it is rather preposterous for us to hope the Northern Dimocracy will carry us,
                  when they can't carry a single State uv their own; jist about ez preposterous ez
                  it is for them to look to us for help, when all uv us ez wood jine em hevn't got a
                  vote. Pollock's remark,—"In a pullin match, a corpse ain't of much akkount, even
                  ef it is a big one,"—weighs onto my mind. Suthin can't come out uv nothin; tho ez
                  in the case uv Seward, nothin may come out uv suthin. Ef we cood git—but, pshaw!
                     we<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7103-00000112"/> can't. Thank the Lord, we kin

               <p>IN castin my eye carelessly over the politikle field, wich Seward and me do every
                  sixty days, I think I kin spy into the horizon a bud wich is swellin into a most
                  hopeful flower. It is spredin itself into a hurricane, wich threatens to sweep
                  away the fabric uv Ablishnism and purify the politikle atmosphere. The Radikle
                  party hev bin at last forced to adopt the legitimit endin uv their sooicidle
                  principles,—nigger suffrage,—and from that the Dimokrisy, ef they are wise, will
                  snatch a triumph litrally from the jaws uv death. WE HEV EM NOW. In Ohio that
                  question is to be voted onto this fall; in Noo York and Michigan it's raisin a
                  breeze in<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7103-00000113"/> ther Convenshuns; and in
                  Pennsylvania, Illinoy, and Indiana, it can't be long put off. It's our best holt.
                  The proud Caucashen, wich votes the Dimecratic tikkit, hez no objeckshun to bein
                  jossled by the Nigger in the rush to pay taxes; but his hawty soul recoils at the
                  idee uv bein elbowed by him at the polls. Besides, the Dimecratic voters don't
                  want the ballot given to any other lower class. It wood make undoo competishen. Ez
                  I remarked, WE'VE GOT EM. Wat the Demokrisy want now is to so handle this delikit
                  subjick ez to make the most uv it.</p>
               <p>The great trouble with the party is, that there is no uniform style uv meetin this
                  question. On the main question we are all agreed. We all oppose nigger suffrage.
                  It's a part and parcel uv a Demokrat's nacher to oppose nigger suffrage. The
                  leaders uv the party opposed it at the beginnin; for seein how the ballot wuz
                  abused by ther followers, they trembled for the Republic ef it wuz entrusted to
                  the hands uv any more uv ekal capassity, and the masses uv the organization
                  opposed givin it to the nigger, becoz that one privilege, and color, wuz all that
                  distinguished em. It's a pecoolvarity uv unregenerated human nacher that it must
                  alluz bear down on somebody. The poet sez,—<q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Even the lice hev smaller ones to bite em,</l>
                        <l>And they still smaller ones, ad infinitum."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Fortunately, the Dimokracy hev the nigger for their smaller lice. The sturdy
                  yeomanry felt it to be a soothin thing to find, wunst each yeer, that in wun thing
                  at least he wuz sooperior to someboddy; and so it will be so long ez there is a
                  Dimokracy. The troo Dimokrat promotes hisself, not by liftin hisself above the
                  level onto wich he finds hisself, but by shovin some wun down to a lower level;
                  and ez ther wuzn't anybody else on this Continent wich they cood git hold uv, the
                  nigger wuz, long ago, selected fur that purpose.</p>
               <p>The great trouble is, we oppose nigger suffrage now from too many stand-pints.
                  Some oppose it on the skore uv the inferiority uv the Afrikin; but that never wuz
                  a popler idea with our people. They may hev assented to it outwardly, but in ther
                  own minds they objected. "Ef," sez a reliable Dimokrat to hisself, "ef that's the
                  rool, WAT IN THUNDER IS TO BECOME UV ME!"</p>
               <p>Likewise the idea uv onfitness, wich others uv our apossels advance. "They can't
                  read nor rite!" shreeks a injoodishus cuss, speekin to a audience, two thirds uv
                  wich go to him reglerly to reed their ballots to em, and who, when they sign
                     promissory<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7103-00000114"/> issory notes, put an X
                  atween their first and last names.</p>
               <p>Anuther speeker quotes Noah to em, and boldy asserts that the nigger is the
                  descendant uv Ham, and that he is the identikle indivijjle wich wuz cust by Noah;
                  but he runs agin the fact that the rest uv em, wich is in Afrika yet, hev managed
                  to dodge the cuss, ez they ain't servin ther white brethren, and them wich wuz
                  brot here to be Chrischinized hev busted ther bonds, and are jest about ez free,
                  so far ez servitood goes, ez anybody.</p>
               <p>There is, ez I hev showed, all these conflictin ideas that work agin us.
                  Therefore, I want a Nashnel Convenshun. I want a convocashen uv the lights uv the
                  party to set forth authoritively WHY we oppose nigger suffrage—to give a reeson
                  for it, that all our people may act together, ez do other well-regulated machines.
                  Let us cum together and ishoo our manifesto, that we may know percisely the
                  pertikler line uv argument to pursoo.</p>
               <p>I shel be at that Convenshun, and I hev made up my mind wot platform to lay down.
                  I shel go back on Ham, Hager, and Onesimus. I shel turn from the inferiority idea,
                  and take the broad ground that <emph>the nigger is a beast; that he ain't a man at
                     all</emph>; and consekently he hez no more rites than any other animal. I put
                  my foot onto him by authority of the decree that unto man wuz given dominion over
                  the beasts; that we are men, and they are beasts. Ef they admit the first
                  proposishen, they will the last. I shel assert boldly and brodly his onfitnis to
                  mingle with us, becoz his fizzikle structure, his muscles, nerves, fibres, bein
                  different, go to show that he wuz uv a different origin, and uv a lower origin. I
                  shel plant myself on the stoopenjus, yet simple proposishen, that the Almity made
                  him, probably, but at a different time and for a different purpus, wich I shel
                  show by citin the color uv his skin, the length uv his foot, the shape uv his
                  head, and sich other matters as I kin git together in time for the Convenshen.</p>
               <p>Uv course this doctrine will meet with objectors. We hev a few thin-skinned
                  perfessers uv religion, whose piety service in our ranks hezn't quite obliterated,
                  who will say that these dogmas undermines the Christian religion, ez it destroys
                  the doctrin uv the unity uv the races onto wich orthodoxy is built. To this I shel
                  answer, that sposin it does, wot then? Uv wot comparison is any religion a
                  Orthodox Dimocrat hez to a triumph uv the party? Wot hez Dimocrisy to do with
                  religion any how? It hez never permitted it to mix in its pollytix. Dimocrisy<pb
                     n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7103-00000115"/> mocrisy bleeves in keepin Church and
                  State ez far apart ez possible.</p>
               <p>Shood the Ablishnists pint to niggers wich reed and write, I shood say to-wunst
                  that there is different degrees uv instink,—that ez one dorg hez more instink than
                  another, that so one nigger hez more than another; and then I shood wind this
                  answer up by askin him, "Sir, wood yoo force yoor dawter to marry a nigger, even
                  ef he cood reed and write?" This hez alluz done good service, pertikelerly ef yoo
                  walk hurridly away before there is time for an answer.</p>
               <p>Ther is one pint wich is a stumper—but only one. One man to whom I unfolded this
                  theory, asked me, sneerinly, wat I wuz a goin to do with a mulatter who wuz half
                  white and half black—half man and half beast—half instink, wich dies with him, and
                  half sole, wich wuz to be saved and fitted for the skies, or lost? When a mulatter
                  dies, wat then? Does the half sole uv the half man drag the instink uv the beast
                  behind it in a limpin, lop-sided fashion, into heaven? or does the instink drag
                  the sole into the limbo for animals? "Ef this latter idea be correct," sed he, "in
                  that limbo how much Southern sole is floatin about, held in solooshen in animal
                  instink!"</p>
               <p>An old friend uv mine, in Kentucky, become indignant wen I propounded the beast
                  theory to him, and he threatened me with corporeal punishment ef I didn't quit his
                  presence—wich I did to-wunst. Alas, for the imprudence of zealous men! Before
                  speekin to him on the subjick, I didn't notis the skores uv brite yeller children
                  all about the place, rangin from the infant uv six months to the boy uv sixteen,
                  and all uv em with his noze!</p>
               <p>But, notwithstandin these drawbacks, it's the most healthy doctrine we've got, and
                  the only ground upon which we kin stand sekoorly. It kivers the ground, and
                  besides, it don't interfere with anybody else's idea. The orators wich implore the
                  people ef they want to marry niggers, kin make the appeal with more force after
                  assertin that the nigger is a beast; and the anshent virgins, who will this fall
                  bear the banners onto wich will be proudly inscribed, "We want no niggers for
                  husbands!" will bear em still more defiantly; for, if they reely bleeve the
                  doctrine, they will be in earnest in it.</p>
               <p>At all evence, let the Convenshun be called, that this question may be settled.
                  Let us all stand on one platform, that we may make the most uv this God-send. Let
                  us inscribe onto our banner the inskripshen, "Ameriky fur white men!" "Eternel<pb
                     n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7103-00000116"/> nel hostility to Animel Suffrage!" and
                  go in to win. Ef the Amerikin people don't shy at Nigger Suffrage now, they never
                  will.</p>

                  <p>EDITOR TOLEDO BLADE. SIR: Enclosed find photograff uv myself, ez you desired.
                     To make a strikin picter, I flung myself into the attitood, and assoomed the
                     expreshun wich mite hev bin observed onto my classikle countenance when in the
                     act uv deliverin my justly celebrated sermon, "The wages uv Sin is Death." The
                     $2.00 wich yoo remitted to kiver the cost uv the picter wuz, I regret to say,
                     insuffishent. The picter cost 75 cents, and it took $1.50 worth uv Bascom's
                     newest to stiddy my nerves to the pint uv undergoin the agony uv sittin 3
                     minits in front uv the photograffer. I need not say that he is a incendiary
                     from Massachoosets. Ez the deceased Elder Gavitt's son Issaker hez expressed a
                     burnin desire to possess his apparatus, it is probable that public safety will
                        very<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7103-00000117"/> shortly require the
                     expulsion uv the incendiary. But I hed my revenge—in his pockit is none uv my
                     postal currency. Sekoorin the picter, I told him I wood take it home, and ef my
                     intimit friends, those who knowd me, shood decide it wuz a portrait, I wood
                     call and pay for it afore he left the Corners. Will I do it? Will this
                     picter-takin Ablishnist ever more behold me? Ekko ansers.</p>
                  <p>Yoo may remit the odd twenty-five cents, either by draft on Noo York, or money
                     order, at my resk.</p>
                  <p>I wuz born in the year 1806, at—I will not say where. I hev reasons for
                     conceelin my birthplace. I don't want to set any town in that State up in
                     biznis. That town hez gone loonatic, and gives Ablishn majorities friteful to
                     contemplate, and I don't want to benefit it by givin it a nashnel reputashen. I
                     don't want to double the price uv its property—to be the means uv erectin a
                     dozen, or sich a matter, uv first class hotels to accommodate the crowds ez
                     wood make pilgrimages thither to visit my birthplace. The present owner uv the
                     house into wich I first opened my eyes onto a world uv sin, is a Ablishnist of
                     the darkest dye, and I hev no desire to enrich him. Never, by word uv mine,
                     shel he cut that house up into walkin sticks and buzzum pins.</p>
                  <p>My boyhood wuz spent in the pursoot uv knollege and muskrats, mostly the
                     latter. I wuz a promisin child. My parence wuz Democrats, uv the strictest
                     kind, my mother in partikeler. She hatid eny one that wuzn't Dimocratic, with a
                     hatred that I never saw ekalled. When I say that she woodent borrer tea and
                     sugar and sich uv Whig nabers, the length, and breadth, and depth of her
                     Dimocrisy will be understood.</p>
                  <p>Uv my childhood, I know but little. My father wuz a leadin man in the humble
                     speer in wich he moved, holdin, at different times, the various offices in the
                     town up to constable, the successive steps being road supervisor and pound
                     master. He wuz elected constable, and mite probably hev gone higher, but for an
                     accident that occurred to him the first month. He collected a judgment for $18,
                     and the money wuz paid to him. The good man wuz a talented collector, but wuz
                     singlerly careless in payin over wat he collected. Ez showin the pekoolier bent
                     uv genius uv the old man, I repeet a conversashen I wunst heerd. A man who hed
                     an account to collect, wuz consultin one who knowd my father well, ez to the
                     safety uv puttin a claim into his hands.</p>
                  <p>"Is he a good collector?" askt the man.</p>
                  <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7103-00000118"/>
                  <p>"Splendid!" sed the naber.</p>
                  <p>"Is he a man uv responsibility?" askt the man.</p>
                  <p>"Sir!" sed the naber, "he hez the ability, but yoo'll find when yoo try to git
                     yoor money out uv his hands that he lacks the response."</p>
                  <p>Cood ther hev bin a more techin triboot?</p>
                  <p>He wuz like all men uv genius, unbalanced. His ability was all on one side. The
                     grovelin plaintiff, who didn't admire sich erratic flites, raised a ruckshen
                     about the paltry sum, and my father <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Folded his tent like the Arab,</l>
                           <l>And ez silently stole away."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From that time out, the old gentleman migrated—in fact, he lived mostly on the
                     road. He adopted movin ez a perfeshun, and a very profitable one he made uv it.
                     When his hoss died, the nabors, rather than not hev him move, wood chip in and
                     raise him another. Appreshiatin the compliment they pade him, he alluz went. I
                     menshun these pekooliarities uv my ancestor, becoz <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">

                           <l>We may make our lives sublime,</l>
                           <l>And, departin, leave behind us—"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> ef our talent runs in that direckshun, ez many debts ez he did, though it
                     does require espeshel talents.</p>
                  <p>This hed its inflooence upon my yoothful mind. I saw not only a great deal uv
                     the country, but much uv mankind, and I acquired that adaptability to
                     circumstances wich hez ever distinguished me. Even to this day, ef I can't git
                     gin I kin take whiskey, without a murmur and without repinin.</p>
                  <p>My politicks hez ever bin Dimocratic, and I may say, without egotism, I hev bin
                     a yooseful member uv that party. I voted for Jackson seven times, and for every
                     succeedin Dimocratic candidate ez many times ez possible. For Mick Lellan, I
                     only got in four votes. I didn't approve uv the nominashen, and wuz not overly
                     zealous. Hed he bin electid, wat wood it hev availed me? He hed enuff dismist
                     army officers follerin him to hev filled every offis in his gift, and I hed at
                     that time become too old to foller pollytix for the amoozement it afforded, or
                     for the benefit uv any cause.</p>
                  <p>But this is a digression.</p>
                  <p>My Dimocrisy wuzn't partikerly confirmed; in fact, I wuz not a Dimekrat from
                     any speshel principle, but more becoz those in the speer in wich I moved wuz,
                     until I arrived at the age uv twenty-four. My father wuz intimately acquainted
                     with me, and knowd all my carakteristics-ez well ez tho he hed bin the friend
                     uy my buzzum. One<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7103-00000119"/> day, ez I wuz a
                     layin on my back under a tree, contemplatin the beauties uv nacher, my parent,
                     sez he,—</p>
                  <p>"Pete" (wich is short for my name), "ef yoo ever marry, marry a milliner!"</p>
                  <p>"Why? father uv mine," replied I, openin my eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Becoz, my son," sed he, "she'll hev a trade wich'll support yoo, otherwise
                     yoo'll die uv starvashen when I'm gone."</p>
                  <p>I thot the idea wuz a good one. Thro woman a cuss come into the world, wich
                     cuss wuz labor; and I wuz determined that ez woman hed bin the coz uv requirin
                     somebody to sweat for the bread I eat, woman shood do that sweatin. That nite I
                     perposed to a milliner in the village, and she rejectid my soot. I offered
                     myself, in rapid succeshun, to a widder, who wuz a washerwoman, and to a woman
                     who hed boys old enuff to work, with the same result, when, feelin that suthin
                     wuz nessary to be done to sekoor a pervision for life, I married a nigger
                     washerwoman wich didn't feel above me. Wood you bleeve it? Within an hour after
                     the ceremony wuz pronounst, she sold her persnel property, consistin uv a
                     wash-tub and board, and a assortment uv soap, and investin the proceeds in a
                     red calico dress and a pair uv earrings, insisted on my goin to work to support
                     her! and the township authorities not only maintained her in her loonacy, but
                     refused to extend releef to me, on the ground that I wuz able-bodied.</p>
                  <p>Ez I left that nigger, I vowed to devote my life to the work of gettin uv em
                     down to where they wood hev to support us, and that vow I hev relijusly
                     fulfilled. I hev never failed, by my vote and inflooence, to reduce em to ther
                     normal condishun; I hev never felt good, ceptin when they wuz put down a peg; I
                     hev never wept, save when they wuz bein elevated. I hev bin bathed in tears the
                     heft uv the time for five years past.</p>
                  <p>The offices I hev held hev not been many. I hed signers to a petishun for a
                     post-office in Jackson's time, but I killed my chances by presentin it in
                     person. The old hero looked at me, and remarked that it wuzn't worth while
                     throwin away post-offices on sich—that when he wanted em, he cood buy em at a
                     dollar a dozen. Bookanan wuz agoin to appoint me, but somehow my antecedents
                     got to his ears, and he wuz afeerd uv his respecktability; and I never
                     succeeded till Johnson returned to his first love and embraced us.</p>
                  <p>I hed bin drafted into the Federal army at the<pb n="228-229"
                        xml:id="VAC7103-00000120"/> beginnin uv the war, and hed deserted to the
                     Confederacy. Procoorin a certifikit to that effeck, I applied for a pardon and
                     a place. He didn't like to giv me the offis, but he wanted a party, and, ez his
                     appintments everywhere show, he coodn't be very pertikeler. I succeeded! I bore
                     with me to Kentucky a commishun ez Post Master, and I am now livin in the full
                     enjoyment uv that posishun, and I may say, I am happy.</p>
                  <p>The sosiety is conjenial. Ther is four groceries, onto wich I kin gaze from the
                     winder uv my offis, and jest beyond, enlivenin what wood otherwise be a dull
                     landscape, is a distillery, from wich the smoke uv the torment ascendeth
                     forever. I hev associates who reverence me, and friends who love me. There is
                     nuthin monotonous here. I hev knowd ez many ez eight fites per day, though
                     three or four is considered enuff to break the tedium. And in these deliteful
                     pursoots, leavin behind me the ambishens uv wat mite be called public life,
                     with my daily bread sekoored, with my other sustenance ashoored, with a frend
                     alluz to share my bottle, or, to speek with a greater degree uv akkooracy,
                     frends alluz willin to share ther bottles with me, I am glidin peacefly down
                     the stream uv time, dodgin the troubles, and takin ez much uv the good uv life
                     ez I kin.</p>

               <p>THE speculashen in wool, into wich the Dimocrisy uv the South embarkt some months
                  ago, hez, I regret to say, resulted disastrously. The nigger ain't fitted for
                  co-operashen with the Dimocrisy. Instid uv hangin onto us like the ivy onto the
                  oak, he diskivered that, in the South at least, he wuz really the oak and we the
                  ivy; instid uv lookin up to us, he contracted a disagreeable habit uv lookin down
                  onto us. There wuz other reasons why he coodent be made available for our uses,
                  and, therefore, it wuz decided to go back onto the Afrikin, and to agin attempt
                  his reduckshen to ez near his normal speer ez the abnormal condishn uv the times
                  wood admit. The directers uv the college met and changed the name uv the
                  Institooshn back to the "Southern Military &amp; Classikle Institoot," and the
                  Corners wuz itself agin.</p>
               <p>Deekin Pogram lookt ez tho ten years hed bin lifted off him. "How pleasant 'tis,"
                  sed he, "to walk erect agin in front uv a nigger, and to pass em ez tho they wuz
                  niggers! O, ef I cood only wallop one wunst more, methinks I cood die happy!"</p>
               <p>We hed a meetin last nite to consider this nigger question, wich wood hev resultid
                  in great good, and hed a powerful inflooence towards strengthenin the hands uv our
                  brethren in the North, who are fightin the heresy uv nigger suffrage, hed it not
                  bin for that irritashen, Pollock, and that pest, Joe Bigler. I hed made my regler
                  speech on the nigger, and with much effect. I hed quoted from sumboddy's quotashen
                  from Agassiz, which demonstrated the radicle difference there is atween the
                  Afrikin and the proud Caucashen, arguin from the length uv his heel and arm, the
                  thickness uv his skull, and so forth, that the nigger wuz totally unfit to
                  exercise the rites uv free men. I wuz applauded vociferously, and by none more
                  than Pollock and Joe Bigler<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7103-00000122"/> ler. Ez I
                  took my seat, and wuz a wipin the perspirashen from my classikle brow, feelin that
                  I hed settled that question, Pollock riz, and desired to say a few words, and make
                  a suggestion. Sed he,—</p>
               <p>"I hev listened with interest to the elokent speeker, and am happy to say I hev
                  learned fax wich is new to me. Ef I hev ever doubted the inferiority uv the
                  nigger, them doubts are removed, pervidin alluz, that the statements uv the
                  speeker is troo, uv wich I hev no doubt, ez the caracter uv the speeker is a
                  suffishent guarantee for the trooth uv wichever he sez."</p>
               <p>I bowed, stately-like, with the air uv one to whom sich compliments wuz a
                  every-day affair, wich they ain't, by no means; on the contrary, quite the
                  reverse.</p>
               <p>"But I want it demonstrated to the satisfackshen uv the most obtoose. I want rite
                  here a measurement uv the average Afrikin and the average white man, that all the
                  world may know the diffrence. I move that it be did."</p>
               <p>I acceded. "Let it be done," sed I, "that the vexed question may be settled
                  forever."</p>
               <p>Sevral niggers were askt to submit to the measurement, but all refused. Finally
                  Joe Bigler sed he saw Napoleon Johnson—a nigger wich wunst belonged to Deekin
                  Pogram—in the audience. "Napoleon," sed he, "will yoo contribbit yoorself to the
                  great science uv ethnology? Ain't yoo willin to let us yoose yoo a while to
                  demonstrate the grate and growin trooth, that yoor grandfather wuz a monkey? Step
                  up, Napoleon."</p>
               <p>Napoleon, nothing dasht, stept up, and Pollock, Bascom, Bigler, and I measured
                  him, with the followin result:— <table>

               <p>Pollock wuz delited! "Here," sed he, "it is in a nut-shell. Issaker hez a shorter
                  hand, a more narrer hand, a shorter and narrerer foot, and his heel projecks less
                  than the nigger's by 2½ inches! Good Lord, how I hev bin deseeved! Wat errors I
                  hev bin nussin! How kin a human bein hev intelleck whose heel projecks four
                  inches? How rejoict am I that I am at last set rite on these important pints!"</p>
               <p>I smiled beninantly onto him.</p>
               <p>Bigler riz. "I, too," sed he, "am satisfied that the nigger is not wat we, who wuz
                  disposed to consider him fit to exercise rites, supposed him to be. I held firm
                  when the measurement uv his hands and arms wuz bein made, but the heel staggered
                  me. It's clear that no one kin hev intelleck whose leg isn't set in his foot
                  better than that. I shel persoo this investigashen. Hevin now a startin-pint,—a
                  heel, ez I may say, to stand on,—I shel go on to prove the inferiority uv the
                  nigger. With that heel for a fulcrum, I shel, with the lever uv trooth, proceed to
                  upset the fabric uv nigger ekality, and carry confooshen into Boston. I shel
                  assoom that Napoleon is a average specimen uv the lower, or unintellectooal
                  Afriken type. Is it so?"</p>
               <p>"It is! It is!" yelled we all, delited at the happy turn the thing wuz takin.</p>

               <p>"Very well. Now quake, Massachoosets! Napoleon, <emph>kin yoo read?</emph>"</p>
               <p>I saw the trap into wich we hed fallen, and risin hastily, protestid that the
                  examinashen hed bin carried far enuff, and so did Deekin Pogram; but Bigler swore
                  he wuz a goin to kiver Massachoosets with shame, and I sot down paralyzed.</p>

               <p>The nigger read it ez peert ez a Noo England skool marm, wich well he mite, ez he

               <p>"Certinly;" and takin a pencil he writ half uv the Declarashen uv
                  Independence.</p>
               <p>"Set down, Napoleon. It's a devilish pity yoor heels is so long; otherwise yood be
                  credited with hevin intellek. Now Issaker, my bold Caucashen, <emph>kin yoo

               <p>"I protest!" shreeked I, in agony. "Issaker don't answer the skoffer at
                  ethnology!"</p>
               <p>But Issaker, ez white ez a sheet, and tremblin under the eye uv Bigler, who knowd
                  him from infancy, stuttered out, "No!"</p>
               <p>"Kin you rite, my gay desendant uv the sooperior race?"</p>
               <p>And, still under the inflooence uv Bigler's eye, he answerd, "No!"</p>
               <p>"Kin yoo cipher?"</p>
               <p>"What in thunder's the yoose uv cipherin, when the old man alluz kep a nigger to
                  do his figgerin?"</p>
               <p>"Set down, Issaker. We're done with you. There's an error sumwher. The nigger's
                  capassity uv skull is less by sevral cubic inches, but he seems to hev made a
                  lively yoose uv wat he hez. But it's all rite, Parson. Issaker shel vote, and the
                  nigger shan't. Reedin and writin never wuz a qualificashen for votin down here,
                  any way. Possibly the seat uv the intellek is in the heel insted uv the brain,
                  wich accounts for the nigger's hevin the most uv it."</p>
               <p>And Pollock and Bigler, and the niggers present, left the meetin-house, laffin
                  uproarously, and throwin all sorts uv adoos back to us.</p>
               <p>I doubt whether the result uv the investigashen will help our friends North. The
                  fact is, it wuz overdone. It wuz carried too fur. There is a pint at wich facts
                  ought to stop—Dimekratic facts in partikeler. In this instance, the investigashen
                  shood never hev bin carried beyond the heel. Hed it stopt there, we wood hev hed
                  em. But carryin it to the radical pint, Bigler and Pollock took it, the foundashen
                  we built wuz upset, and we are all at sea agin. Wood, oh! wood that we wuz rid uv
                  these jeerin fanatics.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>LAST nite there wuz a convocashen uv the saints connected with the Institoot (uv
                  wich Deekin Pogram is the cheefest and lovelist among ten thousand), to take sweet
                  counsel together onto sevral matters connected with the institooshen uv learnin,
                  the success uv wich is so dear to all uv us. The conversashen happenin to turn
                  upon the conferrin uv honorary degrees, Deekin Pogram sed that he hed a suggestion
                  to make. He hed notist that all the leadin colleges uv the country hed a practis
                  uv conferrin titles, sich as "M. D.," "A. B.," "LL. D.," and sich, onto
                  distinguished men, though he wuz free to say that he didn't know wat in thunder
                  they meant, or wat they wuz good for; but he hed notist in a noospaper that no
                  college hed yet conferred any sich onto Androo Johnson. Considerin it a burnin
                  shame, he wood sejest that as a rebook to the hidebound institooshens uv the
                  North, this college do to-wunst confer all uv em, and ez meny more ez there is,
                  onto Mr. Johnson. Bascom remarkt that he didn't kno whether the President wood
                  feel complimentid. "You kno, Deekin," sed he, "that this ain't much uv a
                  college."</p>
               <p>"Troo," sed the blessid old peece uv innosence, "troo, troo; but then, to balance
                  that, Johnson ain't much of a President, you kno."</p>
               <p>And so the honorary degrees wuz conferred, and notis thereof wuz sent him
                  immejitly. From this the question uv the next nominee uv the party for President
                  came up. Bascom, who isn't a far-seein man, asserted that it wood be necessary to
                  nominate Grant. The Deekin remarkt that he thought it wood be safe, but McPelter
                  thought different. He didn't bleeve, in the first place, that it become a Peace
                  party, or at least a party wich, ef it dipped its hands in gore at all, did it
                  mostly in Northern gore, to take up a Northern General, wich had dun his best
                  towards sendin many thousands of Southners<pb n="240-241"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000126"/> ners to their long homes; and besides, the General
                  wouldn't take it.</p>
               <p>Bascom wanted to know what the conference at Long Branch meant? Ef General Grant
                  wuz in the control uv Weed, Raymond, and the Noo York Herald, wich wuz ekal to the
                  World, the Flesh, and the Devil, he felt that he hed trooly found the broad,
                  macadamized road to Democrisy. He begun to hev hopes uv him. Various opinions wuz
                  expressed by various persons, when, without comin to any conclusion, we separatid.
                  I retired that nite earlier than usual, and, dwellin on the chances uv my
                  continuin in offis in case uv Grant's accession, I fell into a troubled sleep and
                  dreamed a dream.</p>
               <p>Methawt gathered in front uv the White House wuz a galliant array uv our friends.
                  There wuz Franklin Peerce, and Bookanan, and Vallandigum, and the Woods, and
                  Magoffin, and Monroe, and Brite, and Breckinridge, and the leaders uv the
                  Dimocrisy, all a standin ther lookin wishfully at the White House, and wonderin
                  how and by what means they cood git in. Johnson, blessins on his head, stood onto
                  the portico wavin to 'em to come, but alass! guardin the passage stood a mighty
                  host uv Ablishnists, armed and clad in armor, and in such force ez to make the
                  storm uv it hopelis.</p>
               <p>"How shall we get in?" sighed Belmont.</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed, how?" ansered Henry Clay Dean.</p>
               <p>"That's the great moral question—how?" ekoed Ben. Wood.</p>
               <p>"My friend," sed Thurlow Weed, "its easy enuff. When you can't sore like the
                  eagle, crawl like the snake. Sorein is preferable, but crawlin will do at a pinch.
                  Is there not the Lion uv the Republic? Can't you git him out and mount him? The
                  Ablishnists hev a regard for that same Lion, and will never discharge ther arrers
                  at you when yoor on his back, for fear uv killin him. Besides, yoor ridin him will
                  in some degree doo away with the prejoodis they hev agin yoo."</p>
               <p>"But how kin we mount him?" said they.</p>
               <p>"Trust to us for that," said Weed, and him and Raymond trotted off together.</p>
               <p>They got the Lion out, but ez soon ez he cast his eyes onto the crowd, he uttered
                  a roar which struck terror into their soles, and lashed the ground with his tail,
                  and cast up dust with his claws, in a manner fearful to behold.</p>
               <p>"He'll never stand it!" said Weed, "onless he's blindfolded," and Thurlow wrapped
                  Raymond like a wet dish-rag over his eyes; and that done, him and Randall pared
                  his nails and blunted his teeth<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7103-00000127"/> (so
                  that ef the bandage should wriggle off and he shood see wher he wuz he coodent
                  hurt anybody), and shaved his mane, till he looked like a very innocent Lion
                  indeed, so that his appearance woodent startle them not used to his fiercenis, and
                  in that condishen they led him very quietly down to the crowd and give the word to
                  mount.</p>
               <p>Lord! what a scramble ther wuz. Tha piled on from the tip uv his ears to the end
                  uv his tale; and them wich coodent git on for lack of room, hung to the feet uv
                  them wich had got on, until it wuz nuthin less than a pirrymid of Democrats.</p>
               <p>Finally, when all wuz loaded, the word wuz given, and the lion moved off. They wuz
                  delited. He hed strength enuff to carry em, and he wuz a a carryin em strate to
                  the White House, and at a good pase, too.</p>
               <p>Ez they approached the portals, the Ablishin defenders uv the place opened onto
                  em.</p>
               <p>"Hold!" said Weed, "wood you destroy the Lion of the Republic?"</p>
               <p>"Stay yoor hands!" shreeked Raymond. "The savior uv the country is under us."</p>
               <p>But they lafft them to scorn.</p>
               <p>"It's Brite and Vallandighum, the Woods, et settry, we're firin at," shreekt they,
                  singin, as they fought, "The Battle Cry uv Freedom," "John Brown's body lies a
                  mouldin in the grave!" and sich other sacriligious odes. "It's them we see, and
                  them we'll kill."</p>
               <p>And they belted away, till the whole mass wuz stretched dead and dyin on the
                  plain.</p>
               <p>Then they came up and began to turn over the corpses, one by one, until at last
                  they came to the body uv the Lion, which, peerced thro and thro, wuz ez dead ez
                  any uv em.</p>
               <p>"My God!" sed they, "<emph>it is the Lion after all!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"And we've slayed him!" sed another.</p>
               <p>"Well!" remarkt a third, "we couldent help it. He was so kivered up with this
                  carrion that I coodent make out what it wuz they wuz a ridin. Let us give him a
                  decent burial for the good he hez done, and forget, if we kin, the company he died
                  in."</p>
               <p>And at this kritikle juncture I awoke.</p>
               <p>I hev an idea I can see a sort uv a warnin in this dreem. It occurs to me,—</p>
               <p>1st. That if we do ride Grant, we'll hev to divest him uv his mane, teeth, and
                  claws, wich is the identical qualities wich makes him valuable to us.</p>

               <p>Interpretin the dream thus, I shel oppose the nomination. Besides, I doubt whether
                  all the Weeds and Raymonds in the country kin so manipulate him ez to bring him
                  quietly into our ranks. We mite possibly go over to him, and thus git the
                  privilege of votin for him, but wherefore? How about the offisis then? Ef the
                  Ablishnists vote for him, and we vote for him, the obligation is ekal, and between
                  us is ther any doubt wich he'd chose? I don't want to take sich chances. I'm
                  opposed to the movement. I care not what others may do, but ez for me, give me
                  straightout Dimocrisy or nothing. McClellan was a vencher wich satisfied me ez to
                  the propriety uv undertakin to set a roarin lion a convoyin a flock uv peaceful

               <p>IT wuz a conjenyel party. Ther wuz me, and Deekin Pogram, and Bascom, uv
                  course,—for it wuz at Bascom's,—and Capt. McPelter, and Issaker Gavitt, and Joe
                  Bigler, who wuz, naterally, mischeevusly intoxicated. We hed met to rejoise over
                  the result uv the Kentucky eleckshun, and the removal uv Stanton and Sheridan, and
                  we rejoist. We hed rejoist for several hours, when the Deekin,—blessins on his
                  frosty pow,—perposed that we take one more drink, to wich we ackseeded with
                  alacrity. Ez Bascom handed back the Deekin his change, the old man observed among
                  it a most villainous counterfeit ten-cent postal currency. "Bascom," sed he, in an
                  injoored tone, "really I can't take that—it's counterfeit." "Certin 'tis,
                     Deekin,"<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7103-00000129"/> sed George W., "certin; but
                  what's the odds? Ez a matter uv course, Deekin, I'll git it agin afore to-morrer.
                  It's evenchooally my loss, ain't it, ez I git all the money that floats here?
                  Carry it till it comes around to me, Deekin, in the nateral course uv evence. Let
                  us bear each other's burdens, Deekin?" And Bascom smiled sweetly onto him.</p>
               <p>I don't know when I felt so happy. Kentucky hed spoken. We hed elected Helm by a
                  majority of forty odd thousand, and hed with him elected a strate State ticket,
                  incloodin all the Congressmen. The Ablishnists hed no show watever. The candidates
                  were strate Demokrats, every one uv em. Sum uv em hed bin accoosed uv leanin
                  towards the Fedrel side, but they hed, by affidavits, proved their-selves troo to
                  the Democrisy. One candidate hed bin charged, by a envious cuss, uv hevin furnisht
                  the Federal forces with hosses, but he indignantly repelled the charge. His
                  enemies brought forrerd the documents, showin that he hed furnisht the Fedral
                  forces with hosses, and I trembled for him. But he smilingly cum to the scratch.
                  He <emph>hed</emph> contracted to furnish em with hosses—he <emph>hed</emph> taken
                  their accursed greenbacks,—but wherefore? Wuz it to benefit em? Wuz it to add to
                  the resources of the gorrila Linkin, or the reverse? Let the facts answer. When
                  wuz the hosses delivered? Ha! ha! Did the Fedral offiser git em? He did. Did he
                  keep em? Alars! That nite John Morgan, who seeled his devoshen to the Confederacy
                  with his blood, scooped em, and them hosses, which the Fedrals paid for, did
                  servis in the Confedrit army. He wood ask his maligners whether it was sinful for
                  a troo Confedrit to take money uv the Fedrals for furnishin supplies to the
                  Confederacy? Hed these hosses remained in the hands uv the farmers uv Kentucky,
                  John Morgan wood hev felt a delicacy in takin em; ez the farmers hed hed valyoo
                  receeved he wuz free, and he took em. Sich reasonin cood not fail to convince, and
                  the candidate wuz, uv course, electid. The shafts uv his enemies fell
                  pintless.</p>
               <p>Therefore I felt happy. The waves uv Ablishnism rolled over all the other States,
                  but aginst Kentucky they struck harmless. Kentucky is a brite oasis in the desert.
                  Built onto Ham and Hager, bleevin in the sooperiority uv the white race, and that
                  same race holdin in their hands the privilege uv sayin who shood and who shood not
                  vote, they wuz safe. And we sot in silence, contemplatin our happiness.</p>
               <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7103-00000130"/>
               <p>At last Deekin Pogram spoke. He sighed cz he spoke. He hed heard uv Tennessee. He
                  hed seen the 'lection returns, and he wuz ez much afflicted ez we wuz rejoist.
                  "Wherefore," sed he, "shood we feel good, while our brethren in Tennessee are
                  wailin over ther woes? The nigger with us is in his normal speer. Sence this
                  eleckshen they bow their heads in silence, and dodge by ez ef they were afraid uv
                  us, wich is a good sign. They hev lost the airs they assoomed afore, and are more
                  like slaves and less like men. I hev twelve uv em a sweatin on my farm, and four
                  expatiatin the cuss uv Noer in my kitchen. The men yield to the power uv the
                  stronger race, and the females bow meekly to ther destiny. Tom, my oldest son, is
                  happy, and stays at home, and my other sons is ez contentid ez they kin be. But it
                  is not so in Tennessee. There they are not normal. There white men bow beneath a
                  power they can't resist. There the nigger holds up his hed, and the Confedrit
                  white man sneaks. There the abnormel nigger hez a vote, and the white man, who
                  follered his State, is disfranchised. My God! how kin a man be happy under sich
                  circumstances? How kin a Dimokrat rejoice when jist across the line he sees
                  Liberty weepin, prostrate, and the white man, who struck for his rites, pinin
                  becoz uv his deprivashen uv the rite uv suffrage?"</p>
               <p>He cood feel good over Kentucky, but he wept over Tennessee.</p>
               <p>Bascom remarkt that he, too, felt for Tennessee, but he wuz consoled. Kentucky hed
                  proved troo, and Johnson, one worthy son uv Tennessee, hed removed Stanton! Wat
                  more cood we want? Kentucky hed gone Dimocratic, and Johnson hed removed
                  Stanton—</p>
               <p>"And Tennessee hed elected Brownlow, and Johnson hez appinted Grant," whispered
                  Joe Bigler.</p>
               <p>"And," spoke up McPelter, "and Sheridan is removed."</p>
               <p>"Troo! Troo!" retorted Bigler, "and put Thomas in his place. The man who whaled us
                  in the Shenandoah Valley is deposed to make room for the man wat whaled us in
                  Tennessee."</p>
               <p>This bit us. This griped us. This is wuss nor a cathartic to us. Ef Kentucky is
                  oil, Tennessee is aquafortis. Ef Stanton is soothin, Grant is pizen. Wherin are we
                  better with the one than with the other? is a question wich we askt ourselves over
                  and over agin.</p>
               <p>But we felt good after all. Tennessee is to the<pb n="250-251"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000131"/> Democracy a dark cloud, but Kentucky is the silver
                  lining to it. Ef no Confedrits wuz allowed to vote in Tennessee, thank the Lord no
                  other kind wuz permitted to hist in ballots in Kentucky. The troo, sterlin
                  Democracy uv Tennessee may suffer, and it is probable that they will suffer. There
                  the Ethiopian votes by State law, but Kentucky is herself alone. Kentucky will
                  never be so afflicted. Kentucky hez yet the makin uv her own laws. She will let
                  them vote ez she sees fit, and none others. Relyin on Ham and Hager, she will deny
                  the niggers that rite, and will keep the power in her own hands. Congris dassent
                  interfere. Thad Stevens may howl, but he's lost his holt. Congris dassent make a
                  law prescribin the rite uv suffrage, and sayin who shel and who shel not vote, for
                  Congris is Conservative. Thad Stevens may shreek, but Congris, ain't eddicatid up
                  to the pint uv keepin within hailin distance uv ther own principles. Congris hed
                  ruther see them wich adhered to the forchunes uv the Federel Goverment sunk than
                  to exercise its power, for so far the matter hez bin left to the States. Likewise
                  wood it ruther see every nigger in Kentucky, no matter tho they wuz all survivors
                  uv Fort Piller, redoost agin to ther normal condishen ruther than give em the
                  means uv pertectin themselves. The nigger may be a man in Tennessee, but he shel
                  be a nigger in Kentucky forever, becoz it alluz hez bin so. Bless the Lord! That
                  idea uv holdin to form and clinging to precedent is our salvashen. I begged em all
                  to dismiss ther fears. Ohio is hagglin and bogglin ez to whether it will give her
                  niggers the ballot; and ef she refooses, how kin she interfere with Kentucky?
                  Congris dassent mix in the matter, for half the men that's sent to Washinton hev a
                  greater fear uv shadders than they hev uv substance, and they sleep with that old
                  hag Precedent, when they mite ez well repose in the arms uv the virgin Progress.
                  They've got holt uv the tail uv an idea that's too big for em,—they can't manage
                  it from that end, and they're afraid to ketch it at the other.</p>
               <p>We shell do well for a long time. We can't afford to shed tears over Tennessee—let
                  us thank the Lord that Kentucky is safe. Here we kin flog our niggers,—here we
                  shel hev the Institooshen in sperit, ef not in name,—here Dimocrasy kin flourish,
                  ef nowhere else. Let us be thankful that it is ez it is. Let us praise the Lord
                  for a Congris that acted ez a drag on the sperit uv the times, and hedn't pluck
                  enuff to do all that the people wantid. Let us praise the Lord for the
                  conservatism wich woodent<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7103-00000132"/> ent let em
                  make votin a nashnel matter, instid of leavin it to us who know so well who to
                  give it to, and who not. So long ez we're left to ourselves, so long will Kentucky
                  be troo to Dimocrisy.</p>
               <p>They felt encouraged, and the convocation broke up feelin good.</p>

               <p>Wat a thrill run thro me ez I red this! I never felt so good but wunst before in
                  my life. I wuz in<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7103-00000133"/> an inteerior town in
                  Massachusetts four days, wher the most stimulatin bevrage wuz root beer. The

                  soothin, magnetic thrill run thro my veins ez the golden likquid gurgled down my
                  esoffagus! Jest so I thrilled at reedin that despatch. My thot-contracted brow

               <p>I left immejitly, and after a pleasant journey reached Noo Orleens.</p>
               <p>I hed no trouble in finding them to whom I wuz accredited. If there's a divinity
                  wich doth hedge a king, ther must be suthin also in the face uv a troo Dimekrat
                  wich betrays him. I wuz follered to my hotel by a crowd uv the first men uv the
                  city, and when they saw my name onto the register, the scene wuz terrific. They
                  knowd me! they knowd my comin wuzn't for nothin, and afore I hed time to say nay,
                  I wuz hurried to the "Lost Coz" Club Rooms, and made an onorary member for life,
                  incloodin the freedom uv the bar, wich privilege I prized.</p>
               <p>"Wat nooze from Washinton?" shouted they all with one akkord.</p>
               <p>"Calm yourselves!" sed I, impressively, "and restrane yoor emoshens. Four days ago

                  In my revolver there wuz one load—in the cart under the corpses wuz a nigger,
                  groanin. I mounted the cart, and turned over the corpses—the wounded nigger had on

               <p>"Glorious sperit!" sed I, in eggstacy, wringin his hand.</p>
               <p>"Just in front uv wher we stand thirty odd niggers wuz killed, and one or two uv
                  them Burow teachers. It don't become me to say how many I killed, but I wan't
                  idle. In three weeks thereafter I received my pardon from the President, and am
                  now, thank God, a citizen."</p>
               <p>By this time we reached the Club again, and for hours I listened to tales of
                  oppression on the part of the military satraps, wich made my blood run cold. A
                  citizen hed shot a nigger—and forthwith he wuz torn from the buzzum uv his family
                  and inkarserated in the common prizen! Another's wife hed throwd a buckit uv bilin
                  water over a wench in the street, uv wich the perverse creacher died, and she,
                  too, wuz arrested. Policemen hed bin discharged for refoosin to arrest men whose
                  spirits coodent brook nigger ekality, and who hed banged em about somewhat; and
                  others had bin dismisst for hurrahin for Jeff Davis and pullin down Fedral flags.
                  Ther hed bin no liberty uv speech nor ackshen. This Club Room hed bin invaded, and
                  pistols and shot guns hed bin taken out by these despots, wich wuz a grindin the
                  citizens into the dust. But the most oppressive case wuz that uv one uv our first
                  citizens, who hed a girl in his family who wood persist in attendin skools after
                  he hed postively forbid her doin so. He tied her up, and in the most patriarchal
                  manner gave her one hundred and fourteen lashes. She wuz obstinit and died. He
                  gave her a Chrischen berriel, but nevertheless he wuz pulled up, and fined and
                  imprizened! Fined and imprizend for wallopin a nigger!</p>
               <p>Then biznis commenced. Lists were bein made out, the purport uv wich I
                  comprehendid. "Enter up," sed one, oilin a revolver, "the nest uv niggers on the
                  alley jist around the corner from my house. They hev ther a chapel, in wich they
                  hev preechin Sundays, and skools doorin the week. Aside from the annoyance it is
                  to my family, it's really dangerous.<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7103-00000135"/>
                  Two hundred nigger children attend it, beside the adult nigger classes."</p>
               <p>"Enter up," sed another, cleanin out a shot-gun, "a grocer on the same street. He
                  is from Iowa, and teaches a Sunday skool class in that same chapel. Sich
                  incendiaries we kin never tolerate."—"There's a nigger church two squares from me
                  wich must be abated," sed another; "and, by the way, a agent uv the nigger
                  missionary sosiety and two teachers from Connecticut boards next door. Put em
                  down."—"In my part uv the city," sed another, "there's four nigger draymen who hev
                  bin suffishently impudent to scrape together enuff to buy ground and build em
                  houses. Don't forget to put em down—don't. They are niggers and hev houses. I," he
                  added, bitterly, "I am a white man, and hev none. Put em down. When Sheridan goes!
                  ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>And so on. The sekretary entered the names ez fast ez they wuz furnisht him, until
                  the name uv every man suspectid uv Yankee perclivities wuz registered. The niggers
                  wuz not put down, 'ceptin them uv sich prominence ez they desired to make shoor
                  uv. It is considered entirely safe to kill a nigger anywhere. Sum uv em desired to
                  make excepshuns in favor uv certin niggers who cood be dependid pendid upon ez
                  troo. One uv em kep a keno, and t'other a faro bank. But they wuz rooled out. The
                  niggers, it wuz desided, wuzn't to be trustid. Their impudence, in persumin to
                  keep faro banks, was friteful.</p>
               <p>The next day, brite and early, I wuz at the Club, when I receeved another
                  despatch. The members flockt around me. "Is it done?" shreekt they. "Is Stanton
                  out?"</p>
               <p>"He is," sed I, slowly, "he is, but—"</p>
               <p>"But what? Oh, releeve our suspense!"</p>
               <p>"But Grant is in!" returned I, droppin the message, and sinkin on a sofa in a
                  brown study. But they wuz delited.</p>
               <p>"It's better than we hoped," sed they. "Grant hez come over at last. Bless the
                  Lord! His name will give the administration strength." They cheerd like
                  loonatics.</p>
               <p>Finally, one mornin I got a despatch that Sheridan wood be releeved that day, and
                  the enthoosiasm biled up agin—this time I shared in it, for I felt that that wuz
                  trooly suthin. It wuz impossible to restrane the gentle lambs uv the Club any
                  longer. Ez a sort of a lunch, preceding the feast that wuz to come, they sallied
                  out and made it lively for sich niggers ez they cood git safely near to. At
                     noon<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7103-00000136"/> the next dispatch came to me.
                  The entire membership uv the Club wuz gathered around, impashent to hear me sound
                  the glad tidins over Egypt's dark sea. I broke the seal.</p>
               <p>"Sheridan is removed this day!—"</p>
               <p>"Ror! Ror! Ror!" cheered the Club.</p>
               <p>"And Thomas is appinted in his place!"</p>
               <p>So read the despatch. There wuz nary a cheer follered it. The most death-like
                  silence pervaded the rooms. One by one the members skulked out to settle with the
                  niggers whose heds they hed bustid in the mornin, and to ashoor em it wuz all a
                  joke. The lists wuz destroyed, and the revolvers and shotguns wuz all packed away.
                  At a meetin held immejitly, the follerin resolooshens wuz passed:—</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That it is possible for men whose faith is bigger nor a
                  grain uv mustard seed, to hev confidence in President Johnson, but ourn is gin
                  out.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That we asked him for bread, and he give us a stone; we
                  asked him for an egg, and he give us a scorpion.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That a committee uv two be appointed to toss up for the
                  difference between Sheridan and Thomas, and another to figger up wherein we are
                  better off under Grant than we wuz under Stanton.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That the President, in awakenin hopes only to dash em to
                  the ground, is guilty uv a crooel disregard uv our feelins.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved, That if he is ever goin to do anything for us, why don't
                  he do it? and—"</p>
               <p>At this pint another despatch came. I was too much affected to read it, and I
                  passt it to the President. "Hell!" sed he. "Gentle sirs, hunt yer holes. Thomas is
                  sick and won't come, and Sheridan is goin to stay after all."</p>
               <p>Concludin that my offishel duties prevented me from makin a longer stay in Noo
                  Orleans, I hastened North agin with all speed. Jest ez I wuz leavin the city I got
                  another despatch, statin that Hancock wuz appinted to Sheridan's place. I didn't
                  consider the nooze suffishently cheerin to indoose me to go back agin. I feel that
                  men uv my opinions is safer in Kentucky than any where else. Kentucky didn't
                  secede, and therefore within her borders secesshenists are safe. Thank the Lord
                  for Kentucky.</p>
               <p>They don't do Johnson justice down there, tho. He wood help em if he cood, but he
                  can't. Congris<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7103-00000137"/> gris tied his hands. He
                  kin appint this man or that man, but both this man and that man are bound to
                  execoot the law. Wat kin the President do?</p>

               <p>I WUZ brot to Washinton by a despatch. His Eggslency hed at last determined to put
                  his foot down—to assert his power, and to take measures sich ez wood bring to the
                  top, where they properly belong, that large class uv the citizens uv the Republic
                  who wuz engaged in the little onpleasantnis, wich the Ablishnists took advantage
                  uv to deprive em uv their rites, and to keep em from exercisin the inflooence in
                  the government they are, and alluz wuz, entitled to. In short, ez Congress wuz
                  adjourned, and coodent, by no means, be got together till November, the President
                  wuz convinced that it wuz his dooty to improve his time, and be reelly

               <p>The consultation over the Proclamation wuz long and painful. Binckley, who is now
                  runnin the government mostly, hed written the whereases, wich is the most uv the
                  document. Seward hed taild onto em the Proclamation proper, wich wuz so small ez
                  to give it a tad-pole appearance, and it wuz to be discussed. All uv em wuz in
                  favor uv it but me. Ez anxious ez I wuz for the liberashen uv our friends in the
                  Southern States; ez anxious ez I wuz to give that blessid saint, Deekin Pogram, a
                  chance to wallop a nigger agin afore he died, without bein interfered with by a
                  bloo-coated hirelin, I still hed a dread. "Dare yoo," sed I, "go further in this
                  biznis? isn't impeachment at the end uv it, ef yoo stir up this matter? And with
                  Wade in the Presidenshel chair—my God! Pollock wood hev MY post offis! My liege, I

               <p>"Go on with the dream," sed his Eggslency. "Go on, and I will be yoor Joseph to

               <p>"Kin yoo assoom the caracter uv Joseph and carry it out," sed Randall, "with Mrs.

               <p>This interupshen preventid me from narratin my dreem, so I resoomed at the pint at

                              between generous foes there kin be none of that terrible spirit uv
                              blind hate which characterizes some uv my associates, who shel be here
                              nameless. I will say, however, that if the Senators from
                              Massachoosets, and some others I cood menshun, wood resine or die,
                              they wood confer a favor upon the country. I oppose you becoz I differ
                              with yoo, ez does my State; but that opposishen hez never lessened my
                              high admirashen uv your patriotism, yoor even temper, or the many good
                              qualities uv your head and heart, wich shine out so conspickuous. I
                              hale you ez a worthy successor uv the first A. J. I hed not intended
                              to mix things persnel to myself in this friendly triboot, but will do
                              violence to my feelins by observin that the posishun uv Collector
                              at——is admirably adapted to a cousin uv mine, whose talence ez a
                              lawyer hez never bin appreciated by those who know him best. He agrees
                              with me that impeachment is not to be thot uv, and that sessions uv
                              Congress, other than reglar ones, is uselis. Shood yoo be pleased to
                              make the appintment, I shel be proud to return the favor in any way
                              possible. Ef it woodent be askin too much, a son uv mine wood be glad
                              to serve his country ez a Inspector uv Revenoo. Inheritin from me
                              devoshun to our common country, he burns to devote himself to her
                              service.</p>

               <p>"Them appintments wuz made also," sed the great man, "and three or four more
                  throwd in when he found how cheep he cood get em. He visited me after I hed given
                  him all he asked for, and we hed a frendly interchange uv views. He persisted in
                  differin with me; but ez we partid, I askt him ef ther wuzn't jist one more
                  appintment he wanted? Jist one more? Throwin himself on my neck, he exclaimed,
                  'Not one! Not one! My brothers, my brothers-in-law, my nephews, and the doubtful
                  members uv the Legislacher, wich finally concloodid to vote for me, are all
                  provided for.' Bless the Lord for the appintin power! The biznis uv tradin

                  end with him."</p>
               <p>It wuz unnecessary for me to read more. I hed seen enuff to satisfy me that the
                  integrity uv one<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7103-00000141"/> third uv the Senit wuz
                  rather honey-combed, and, like a rusty muskit, not strong enuff at the breech to
                  bear a severe trial without danger uv bustin. I saw precisely wat wuz the rock on
                  wich we stood, and what a citadel it wuz. Kin these men, with these letters in the
                  hands uv our respected cheef, and ther relatives all a drawin rashens, turn and
                  rend the hand wich feeds em? Cood I do it?—and ain't they even ez I am?</p>
               <p>And so the proclamashen wuz ishood, and I went home a feelin good. We shall yet
                  wallop niggers in Kentucky,; we shel yet redoose em to ther normal speer; our
                  afflicted brethren in Tennessee will yet vote, and them not amnestied will be
                  speshly pardoned ez ther superior merits deserve, and with all ther will be no
                  impeachment. For where the carkis is, ther will be the buzzards also, and we hev
                  the control uv the carkis. Some uv the buzzards are so gorged with carkis that
                  their eyes is shut—enuff uv em to inshoor our posishen till the end uv our term.
                  It is well with us.</p>

               <p>LAST week I wuz invited to go into Ohio to assist my brethren uv that State. The
                  Massedonian cry reached me, "Come and help us!" and ez the cry wuz coupled with
                  the asshoorance that I shood be pervided for, I heeded it. Couple Massedonian
                  cries with whiskey, and I can't resist em. I never try. I knowd there wuzn't much
                  difference atween the Dimocrisy uv Ohio and Kentucky, but I wuz onprepared for the
                  strikin resemblance I found. Twins is not more similar. My Ist appintment wuz in a
                  purely Dimekratic County. It wuz a settlement after my own heart, and the minit
                     my<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7103-00000142"/> practist eye restid onto it, my
                  sole leaped for joy. It wuz a town wich hed bin some day the seat uv bizniss, but
                  a ralerode runnin some nine miles to one side uv it hed cut off its trade, and the
                  inhabitants hevin nothin to do, the better part uv em went with the trade. Nacher
                  abhors a vacuum, and there rushed in sich as found it diffikult to live elsewhere.
                  The whole population, hevin much leisure, fell to pitchin coppers, wich, to make
                  the game excitin, they pitched for drinks. Pitchin for drinks soon rendered em
                  incapable uv more violent exercise; and in a year from the time the trade left em,
                  it wus the strongest and most intense Democratic town in the State. Ez they must
                  eat suthin, and ez the groseries coodent run perpetooally without money, they hed
                  occasional spasms uv labor. Then wood their feelins be lasseratid. Then wood they
                  look over to the Kentucky shore, and see thousands uv jest sich men ez theirselves
                  a spendin their lives in one unendin round uv copper-pitchin, hoss-racin, and
                  poker-playin, the nigger meanwhile a sweatin to furnish the means, and they wood
                  break out into murmurin at the crooel fate wich cast their lot where every man wuz
                  forst to sweat for hisself, and the cuss of labor coodent be filled by proxy.
                  Their proximity to Kentucky tantalized em. They wood hev all gone there cood they
                  hev raised enuff to buy a nigger apeece, but they coodent. There wuz a most
                  deliteful look uv serene repose about the place wich charmed me. Nothin stood
                  uprite. The sign-post uv the tavern hed bin leaned agin so much that it hed
                  contracted the same habit; the hosses, from a too rigid economy in the matter uv
                  oats, wuz leanin agin the side uv the barns; the shutters on the groseries hung
                  cornerin across the winders, in consekence uv the lower hinges bein broke; the
                  clapboards on the houses all hangin by a single nail at one end, presented any but
                  a reglar appearance; and the men were all either sittin on store boxes, or leanin
                  agin watever possessed suffishent strength to keep em up.</p>
               <p>I wuz enthoosiastically reseeved. The town wuz excited on two questions. 1.
                  Taxation. 2. Nigger Equality. The Cheerman uv the deputashun wuz the most cheerin
                  style uv Demokrat I hed seen for years. His independent hair hed pushed its way
                  thro the top uv his hat and bristled in all directions, biddin defiance to the
                  world; his toes protroodin from his shoes, and his trowsers hangin lop-sided by
                  one suspender, indicated a sovereign contempt for appearances. He begged me, with
                  tears streemin<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7103-00000143"/> down his eyes, to rouse
                  the people agin the dangers wich threatem em. "Think," sed he, "uv the hundreds uv
                  thousands uv millions, wich we, the people, are forced to pay in taxes to the
                  General Government, and rouse em to the necessity uv ackshen!"</p>
               <p>"I will," sed I, "I will. State to me the amount uv taxes paid the tyranikle
                  government in this Arcajen spot, that I may hev the data from wich to speek."</p>
               <p>"Taxes!" returned this patriot, with an amazed look onto his countenance, "taxes!
                  We don't pay any taxes here. The Assessor came here two years ago, and findin
                  nothin to assess, hezn't considered it worth while to come since. But, good Lord,
                  our hearts bleeds for these unfortinit victims uv Ablishn policy wich hev suthin,
                  and is forced to pay onto it! The people is bein ground into dust by taxashen."
                  And the old man wept bitter tears at the miseries uv the sitooashen uv the people.
                  What techin benevolence!</p>
               <p>On the question uv nigger ekality, I found em at a most deliteful heat. They hed
                  seen the terrors uv it, and know'd whereof they spoke. Niggers hed come from
                  Kentucky across the river to em, and instid uv acceptin their normal speer, and
                  yieldin quietly to the irresistible decrees uv Heven, wich made em the inferiors
                  uv the white, they hed, the moment they accumulatid suthin to live on, assoomed
                  the airs uv ekality. They refoosed to keep their places. The Cheerman remarkt, ez
                  showin the stubborn cussedness uv the race, that one uv em lived some months next
                  to him. He (the Cheerman) borrored pork on sevral occashens uv him, twict a bakin
                  uv flour, and, on one occashen, nine dollars uv the misrable rags wich we are
                  forst, by a tyranikle Government, to accept ez money. That nigger hed the soopreme
                  impudence to insist on bein pade! and even talked uv sooin for it. But, on
                  consultin a lawyer, he didn't, owin to the oncertainty ez to who wood hev to pay
                  the costs. Another instance. "A nigger, wich wuz neerly white, settled in the
                  visinity. He hed not only a daughter, but a farm. My son sores. Labor he despises,
                  as a occupashen only fit for serfs. He proposed to woo this nigger's daughter. It
                  wuz a struggle with me. My son marryin a female wich hed the accursed blood uv Ham
                  in her vanes! But Jimuel, my son, sir, threw dirt in my eyes. About sixty akers uv
                  dirt. I thot uv the pleasant time I cood hev a livin on that farm—uv the days
                  devoid uv labor, and the evenins filled with ease, and after a severe
                     ethnologikle<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7103-00000144"/> logikle struggle with
                  my feelins, I consented. I wantid to take keer uv that nigger. Pityin him ez an
                  inferior bein, loaded, in his abnormal condishen, with responsibilities wich he
                  cood not be expected to discharge, I would hev taken charge uv his affares. I
                  wood—my son Jimuel and I—hev managed his farm, and his stock, and sich. Alas!
                  Jimuel menshuned the matter to the Ethiopian, sir, and with wat result? He was
                  ignominiously kickt out uv the house, sir. He wuz d—d, sir, for a drunken broot,
                  by a nigger, wich threatened, if he ever showed his pimpled—pimpled wuz the
                  word—face about there agin, he'd break every bone in his body. Sir, this is
                  becomin unsupportable. They must be dragged down to our level. My proud Caucashen
                  blood revolts. There must be a inferior race, and it's us or the nigger. The Injen
                  is out uv the question, ez there ain't any of them here to be inferior. I wouldn't
                  mind the Injen, but there ain't none. It's the nigger or nothin. Give him the
                  ballot, sir, and what'll distinguish us? Speek with a angel's tongue onto this
                  theme, I beg."</p>
               <p>The meetin wuz a glorious one, and my speech one uv my most movin efforts. My
                  perorashen moved me to tears. It wuz on nigger suffrage. Depictin its untold
                  horrors, I begged em to organize ize—to rally wunst more agin this common enemy.
                  "There is," sed I, "seven thousand nigger males in the State uv Ohio. Shel we
                  peril the liberties uv the State by permittin them to approach the ark uv our
                  safety—the ballot-box? Shel we raise em to the pint uv bein our ekals? Shel we
                  marry em and give em in marriage? Shel we contaminate the pure streem uv
                  Anglo-Saxon blood by muddlin it with the turbid streem uv—"</p>
               <p>At that pint I stopt. My eyeballs wuz seared. Joe Bigler, wich I sposed wuz a
                  hundred miles away in Kentucky, wuz up in the aujence.</p>
               <p>"Agreein," sed he, "with wat the speeker is sayin, I beg to ask a question for
                  enlitenment. I am a Kentuckian."</p>
               <p>"Ror for Kentucky!"</p>
               <p>Bowin, Bigler perceeded. There wuz a lurkin devil in his eye wich afflicted
                  me.</p>
               <p>"Ef I understand the speeker, he holds that the nigger, ef permitted to vote,
                  becomes so much our soshel ekal that we must take him to our buzzums—that we must
                  marry the females, and our gushen daughters forthwith tie themselves to the males
                  uv that accussid race. Is it so?"</p>
               <p>"It is!" retorted I.</p>
               <p>"My blood biles when I think uv it. Ef I recollect<pb n="278-279"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000145"/> lect arite, the laws uv Ohio permits all niggers to
                  vote who are only half black. Ez there are a good many mulattos in this region,
                  the produx uv the loose ekality uv the races over the river, there must have bin,
                  ever sence that law passed, much uv that kind uv marryin here. May I be permitted
                  to ask this oppressed people, who hev suffered so from this unnatural state of
                  affairs, how they like it? Is yoor wife a nigger, sir?" sed he, addressin the
                  Sekretary, "and ef so, don't yoo feel the humiliatin posishen yoor in, compelled,
                  ez you wuz, by the force uv Dimokratic circumstances, to marry her, to take her to
                  yoor buzzum, the minit her father got a vote? It's enuff to drive a man into
                  Ablishnism to escape it. My brethren," sed this Bigler, "I'd advise yoo all to
                  abjoor Dimocrisy. Up North, the minit the nigger gits a vote, yoo are forced to
                  legal missegenashun; down South, the affinity Dimocrisy hez for niggers hez
                  bleached out the race to the color uv molasses. There's no hope for yoo, save in
                  Ablishnism, wich hez the happy fakulty uv doin justis to em without marryin em!"
                  And he stalkt out.</p>
               <p>It didn't make no difference. They didn't know what he wuz talkin about. The word
                  "missegenashen" struck em with amazement, from wich they didn't recover till we
                  left. In speakin to such aujences, men must be keerful uv the words they
                  yoose.</p>
               <p>I finisht my speech. The meetin then resolved they wuz better than niggers; that
                  they never wood consent to be taxed for the benefit uv purse-proud aristocrats;
                  that the bonds shood be taken up with greenbax; that there shood be a return to
                  specie payment to-wunst; and that they were willin to give millions, ef need be,
                  to resist usurpashen, but not one cent in taxes in a unconstitooshnel manner.</p>
               <p>This resolooshn wuz passed, when a colleckshn wuz taken up to pay for the candles.
                  But, alas! There wuzn't nary a cent in the house, and I hed to pay for em myself.
                  Another little insident didn't please me. The State Central Committee hed furnisht
                  me, ez it does all its speakers, with a twenty dollar gold piece and a fifty
                  dollar bond, wich I wuz to exhibit, to show the difference atween Ablishn and
                  Democratic money. I shoved em at the people, and it excited em to madnis. I laid

               <p>FROM Ohio to Washington! Ther is nary peace for me! The sole uv my foot knows no
                  rest. Wher Democresy is in danger, ther am I. I wuz called to Washinton to consult
                  with the friends uv the President in regard to the Anteetam Dedicashun. The part
                  his Eggslency wuz to take in that affair—wat he wuz to say—what others wuz to say,
                  ez well ez who wuz to say it, wuz a matter wich required not only profound
                  thought, but the most careful considerashun. Hence I wuz called.</p>
               <p>I found assembled the entire Cabnet, with the addishen uv Binckley; a gentleman
                  recently arrived<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7103-00000147"/> from a foreign
                  mission, named McCracken; Gov. Swann uv Maryland, Ex-Gov. Bradford; the poet of
                  the day, Gen. McPounder, late uv Lee's staff, now uv the Maryland Melishy; Kernel
                  Screw, ditto, and twelve or twenty more who hed held posishens uv trust and profit
                  under the Confedracy, and who wuz now holdin correspondin posishens under the
                  Govner uv Maryland, all of wich wuz a discussin the various pints involved in this
                  matter. The President hed prepared a speech wich kivered thirty-eight pages uv
                  legle cap paper, and it was segested that he reed it. In the impressive manner for
                  which he is celebrated he began:—</p>
               <p>"Fellow Countrymen—"</p>
               <p>"I object to that fraze," said General McPounder. "It's liable to misconstrucshun.
                  Sposin that upon that stand shood be them wich, doorin the fratrisidle struggle
                  wich lost me my niggers, wuz in the Fedral army? I object to bein considerd the
                  fellows uv sich."</p>
               <p>The objeckshun wuz finally got over by the President's agreein to turn, ez he
                  uttered the words, to the Maryland delegashun; wich satisfied em, ez the most
                  ultra felt it wuz enuff ef the President shood address himself excloosively to
                  Maryland Dimekrats ez his countrymen. He perceeded:—</p>
               <p>"Gathered together onto a field wich the valor uv loyal arms made forever
                  memorable—"</p>
               <p>Gov. Swann objected. He wuz for consiliation. How cood our Southern brethren who
                  had taken the oath be consiliated, ef the fact that they wuz walloped wuz bein
                  continually flung at em? Besides, the word "loyal" wuz offensive to the heft uv
                  the Democracy. Mr. Seward thought ef references wuz made to the late
                  onpleasantness they ought to be diluted. I sustained the objeckshun, and it wuz
                  stricken out. The President resoomed:—</p>
               <p>"Feelin this day an uncommon solemnity, standin, ez we do, over the mortal remanes
                  uv the thousands wich died in the sacred cause uv Liberty, and in defence uv the
                  flag uv our coun—"</p>
               <p>"Hold!" sed the impetuous Maryland General, "I protest. In the name of Maryland I
                  protest. Shel the Conservatives uv that glorious State be insulted by alloosions
                  to liberty uv wich they are deprived, and to the flag wich is the symbol uv
                  oppression, and under wich we didn't fight?"</p>
               <p>I sustained the objeckshun, and that wuz struck out. He went on:—</p>
               <p>"When I cast my eye over this field, and let it rest for a instant on this spot
                  where the impetuous foemen wuz driven southward by our brave troops—"</p>
               <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7103-00000148"/>
               <p>Gov. Swann remarked that on sich an occasion it wood be perhaps better not to
                  menshun the partikeler direckshun in wich anybody wuz driven. Let it read, I wood
                  say, thus: "On this spot where the impetuous foeman wuz driven by our brave
                  troops." Left thus it woodent be espeshally offensive to any body. It wood read ez
                  well South ez North, for in that encounter both sides wuz, at times, driven. I
                  sustained the amendment, and the President went on:—</p>
               <p>"In fucher years the pilgrim to the shrine uv Liberty will paws a moment on this
                  spot, to drop a tear over the graves uv them who here checked the advance uv the
                  hosts uv rebellion, and—"</p>
               <p>Gov. Swann was averse to this. It wuzn't soothin to the party wich wuz checked. It
                  wood be better to reed, "drop a teer over the spot onto wich fraternal blood wuz
                  shed." Seein no objection to the amendment, I hed it done. He went on:—</p>
               <p>"The widder in her Northern home may weep, but she may console herself that her
                  husband died for his country. She may—"</p>
               <p>Gov. Swann broke in. "Sposn," sed he, "you should say, 'The widder in her Northern
                  or Southern home, ez the case may be, may weep,' &amp;c. Woodn't it be better?" I
                  thot so, and it wuz altered accordinly. The President perceeded:—</p>
               <p>"Here, upon this spot, the armed hosts of rebellion were met and hurled back
                  by—"</p>
               <p>Gov. Swann sejested that that be omitted. The word "rebellion," when applied to a
                  brave people, who wuz strugglin for wat they deemed their rites wuz, to say the
                  least, too harsh. It wuz struck out, and the President went on:—</p>
               <p>"Upon this spot, amid the roar uv cannon, the rattle uv musketry, and the clash uv
                  contendin arms, thousands uv the brave sons uv patriotic sires gave up their
                  lives."</p>
               <p>There wuz nothin in this objectionable. It cood apply to either side or to both,
                  but ez everythin before it hed been stricken out, and ez there wuz alloosions
                  follerin it that wood hev to be, it wuz advisable to bust it, and accordinly I
                  drew my pencil over it.</p>
               <p>The President then wanted to know wat in thunder he shood say. Feelin that he must
                  say suthin, I prepared for him the follerin remarks:—</p>
               <p>"My Fellow-Countrymen: I appear afore you, not for the purpose uv makin any
                  lengthy remarks: I simply desire to express my approbashn uv the ceremonies which
                  hev taken place. My appearance is the speech wich I will make. I cood make a
                  speech wich wood tech yoor feelins, but my thots<pb n="286-287"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000149"/> is in communion with the dead—uv both sides—whose
                  deeds we are here to commemorate. I shel not attempt to give utterance to the
                  feelins and emoshuns inspired by the ceremonies uv the day. Not any. I shel
                  attempt no sich thing. I am here to give countenance to the perceedins—to
                  offishally beam upon em—but I must be permitted to hope that we may foller the
                  example set us by the illustrious dead-uv both sides—and think uv the brave men—uv
                  both sides—who fell in the fierce struggle uv battle, and who sleep silent in
                  their graves, yes—who sleep in silence and peace after the conflict hez ceased.
                  Would to God that we uv the livin cood emulate their example ez they lay sleepin
                  in the tombs. Wood that we cood live, ez do the silent dead, in peace and
                  friendship. Yes, in peace and friendship ez do the silent dead—uv both sides. You,
                  my fellow-countrymen, hev my earnest wishes, ez yoo hev hed my efforts in times
                  gone by, in the most tryin perils, to restore peace and harmony to our distracted
                  and divided country, and yoo shel hev my last efforts in vindicatin uv the flag uv
                  the Republic, and the Constitooshn uv our Fathers."</p>
               <p>I endeavored in this to preserve, ez nearly as possible, the singularly beautiful
                  and loocid style uv the President, that the assembled thousands who shood hear it
                  mite recognize it to-wunst ez hizzen. The last sentence wuz objected to. The
                  Marylanders didn't know whether they cood sit in silence and hear sich talk about
                  the "Flag uv the Republic" and the "Constitooshun uv our Fathers." But they wuz
                  overruled. It wuz held, and properly, I think, that the Constitooshun uv our
                  Fathers shood be understood ez meanin that instrooment afore the Ablishnists had
                  knocked out uv it all that made it lovely in the eyes of Maryland—the nigger—and
                  the Flag ez it wuz at that period. They wuz finally satisfied with it, and
                  Binckley teched up the speech in some miner pints for delivery.</p>
               <p>I didn't stay to the celebrashun, for I hed biznis elsewhere. I writ the
                  President's speech, so I knew that wuz rite; I heard Bradford's orashen read, and
                  wuz pleased with it. It wuz a powerful apology for the Northern soldiers, and must
                  hev had a good effeck onto the Southern mind. Feelin that it wuz all rite, I left
                  agin for my feeld uv labor. Wat the President wood do without me, I don't
                  know.</p>

               <p>FEELIN that the time hed arrived which wuz to decide whether 7,000 degradid
                  niggers wuz to grind 500,000 proud Caucashens into the dust, I felt that ef I
                  shood fail in my dooty now, I shood be forever disgraced. Accordingly, I put in on
                  elekshun day at a Dimocratic town in Ohio—the battlefield—the identikle place into
                  wich I made a speech doorin the campane.</p>
               <p>I arrived ther on the mornin uv the elekshun, and found that comperhensive

                  proposishen. Paradin the streets ez early ez 7 A. M. wuz a wagon containin 25
                  virgins, runnin from 27 to 31, the most uv em ruther wiry in texture, and<figure>

                  followin techin inscriptions: "Fathers, save us from Nigger Ekality!" "White
                  Husbans or nun!" It wood hev bin better, I thot, hed they bin somewhat younger.
                  Ther wuz suthin preposterous in the ijea uv females uv that age callin upon
                  fathers to save em from anythin, when in the course of nacher their fathers must
                  hev bin a lyin in the silent tomb for several consecutive years, onless, indeed,
                  they marrid young. Ef still livin (I judged from the aged appearance uv the
                  damsels), their parents must be too far advanced in yeers to take an activ part in
                  biznis. In anuther wagon wuz a collekshun uv men wich hed bin hired from the
                  railrode, twelve miles distant, whose banners read, "Shel ignerent Niggers vote
                  beside intelligint Wite men?" and the follerin verse:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It okkurd to me that it wood hev done better hed their spellin bin more akkerit;
                  but upon inquiry I found that it didn't make no diffrence. That wuz the pervailin
                  way of spellin things in that vicinity. Hangin over the polls wuz a broad peece uv
                     white<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7103-00000152"/> muslin, onto wich was painted,
                  in large letters, "Caucashuns, Respeck yer Noses—the nigger stinks!" Then I knowed
                  it wuz safe. That odor hez never yet bin resisted by the Democrasy, and it hez its
                  inflooence over Republikins.</p>
               <p>I never saw sich enthoosiasm, or more cheerin indicasuns uv the pride uv race. Ez
                  evidence uv the deep feeling that pervaded that community, I state that nine
                  paupers in the poor-house demanded to be taken to the polls, that they might enter
                  their protest agin bringin the nigger up to a ekality with em, wich wuz nine gain
                  with no offsets, ez ther wuzn't an Ablishnist in the institooshun. Two men, in the
                  county jale for petty larceny, wuz, at their own rekest, taken out of doorance
                  vile by the Sheriff uv the county, that they mite, by the ballot, protest agin
                  bein degraded by bein compelled, when their time wuz out, to acknowledge the
                  nigger ez their ekal. One enthoosiastic Dimekrat, who cost us $5, hed to be
                  carried to the polls. He hed commenced early at one uv the groseries, and hed
                  succumbd afore votin. We found him sleepin peacefully in a barn. We lifted the
                  patriotic man, and in percession marched to the polls. We stood him on his feet,
                  two men supportin him—one on either side. I put a straight ticket into his
                  fingers, and takin his wrist with one hand, held his fingers together with tother,
                  and guided his hand to the box. Ez it neared the winder, he started ez ef a
                  electric shock hed struck him, and, straightenin up, asked, "Is it the sthrate
                  ticket? Is Constooshnel Amindmint No! onto it?"</p>
               <p>Ashoorin him that it wuz all rite, he suffered me to hold his hand out to the
                  Judge uv Eleckshun, who took the ballot and deposited it in the box. "Thank
                  Hivin!" sed he, "the nagur is not yet my ayquil!" and doublin up at the thigh and
                  knee-joints, he sank, limber-like, and gently, onto the ground. Ez he hed
                  discharged the dooty uv an Amerikin freeman, we rolled him out to one side uv the
                  house, wher the drippin uv the rain from the roof wood do suthin toward soberin
                  him off, and left him alone in his glory.</p>
               <p>The Amendment got but a very few votes in that locality. The Republikins jined us
                  in repudiatin it, mostly upon ethnologikle grounds. One asserted that he hed bin
                  in favor uv emancipashen in time uv war, becoz the Afrikin cood thereby be indoost
                  to fite agin their Southern masters, and it wood hev the effeck uv makin the
                  drafts come lighter in his township. He wuz a humanitarian likewise. He opposed
                  crooelty toward em. He wept when he<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7103-00000153"/>
                  heerd uv the massacre at Fort Piller, becoz in the army the nigger wuz ez much a
                  man ez anybody, and sich wholesale slaughters tendid to make calls for "500,000
                  more" more frekent. But when it come to givin uv em the privilege uv votin beside
                  him, it coodent be thot uv. He cood never consent that a race whose heels wuz
                  longer than hizzen shood rool Ameriky. "My God!" sed this ardent Republikin, "ef
                  you give em the ballot, wat kin prevent em from bein Congrismen, Senators,
                  Vice-Presidents, and even Presidents? I shudder when I think uv it;" and he
                  hurried in his vote.</p>
               <p>I didn't quite see the force uv his objecshen, for it never okkurred to me that
                  bein sent to Congris wuz the nateral consekence uv votin. I hev voted for thirty
                  years, at many elections four or five times, but I hev never bin to Congris. Wher
                  is the constitooency wich wood elect me? But it wuzn't my biznis to controvert his
                  posishen. It made no diffrence to me wat his reason wuz for votin ez I desired him
                  to vote.</p>
               <p>The nigger-lovers beat up one man to vote for the Amendment, wich, I saw by his
                  dissatisfied look, hed bin over-perswadid. "Sir!" sed I, "do yoo consider a
                  Afrikin suffishently intelligent to be trustid with so potent a weapon ez the
                  ballot?"</p>
               <p>Bustin away from them wich hed him in charge, he exclaimed, "No, I don't! I can't
                  vote for it. They ain't intelligent enuff. Sir, scratch off the 'Yes' from my
                  ballot, and put onto it 'No!' "</p>
               <p>"Here is a pensil," sed I.</p>
               <p>"Do it yerself," sed he; "I can't write."</p>
               <p>And I did it. Sich is the effeck uv a word in season. Words fitly spoken is apples
                  uv gold, set in picters uv silver.</p>
               <p>One man woodent listen to me, but votid the Amendment. He hed bin a soljer, and
                  for eleven months pertook uv the hospitality uv the Confedrits at Andersonville.
                  Escapin, he wuz helped to the Fedrel lines by a nigger, who wuz flogged almost to
                  death, in his site, for not betrayin wher he wuz hid. I mite ez well hev talked to
                  a lamp-post. Ez he shoved in his ballot, he remarkt suthin about he'd ruther see a
                  nigger vote than a d—d rebel, any time. From the direckshun uv his eye-site, I
                  persoom he referred to me.</p>
               <p>I left for home ez soon ez the votes wuz counted, and the result wuz made known,
                  only waitin till the poll-books wuz made out, and the judges uv eleckshun hed got
                  ther names written by the clerks, and hed made their marks to em. On my way home I
                  wuz gratified to see how the nateral antipathy to<pb n="294-295"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000154"/> the nigger hed revived. At Cincinati, the nite uv
                  the eleckshn, they wuz bangin uv em about, the patriotic Democrisy goin for em
                  wherever they cood find em, and the next day, ez I saw em at the ralerode
                  stashens, they hed, generally speekin, ther heds bandaged. It wuz cheerin to me,
                  and I gloated over it.</p>
               <p>Full of gladnis, I entered Kentucky, and joyfully I wendid my way to the Corners.
                  I wuz the bearer uv tidins uv great joy, and my feet wuz pleasant onto the
                  mountins. Ez I walked into Bascom's, they all saw in my face suthin uv
                  importance.</p>
               <p>"Wat is it?" sed Deekin Pogram. "Is it weal or woe?"</p>
               <p>"Is the proud Caucashen still in the ascendant in Ohio, or hez the grovelin
                  Afrikin ground him into the dust?" askt Issaker Gavitt.</p>
               <p>"My friend," sed I, takin up the Deekin's whisky, wich, in the eggscitement uv the
                  moment, he didn't observe, "the Constitooshnel Amendment, givin the nigger ekal
                  rites, hez bin voted down by the liberty-lovin freemen uv Ohio. Three cheers for
                  Ohio."</p>
               <p>They wuz given with a will. The wildest enthoosiasm wuz awakened. Bascom put a
                  spigot in a fresh barl, and the church bells wuz set a ringin. The niggers wore a
                  dismayed look, and got out uv the way ez soon ez possible. A meetin wuz towunst
                  organized. Deekin Pogram spoke. He felt that this wuz a proud day. Light wuz
                  breakin. The dark clouds uv fanaticism wuz breakin away. We hed now the Afrikin
                  under our feet. We hev got him in his normal posishen in Ohio, and, please God, we
                  will soon hev him likewise in Kentucky. He moved the adopshen uv the follerin

               <p>The meetin broke up with three cheers for the Dimocracy uv Ohio, nine for the
                  Republikins uv that State, and one for the State at large.</p>
               <p>The Fakulty uv the Institoot met next mornin, for the purpus uv revisin the
                  Scripters. It wuz desided that the word "white" should be insertid wherever
                  necessary, and that that edishen only be yoosed by the Dimocracy and Conservativ
                  Republikins. We made progress, the follerin bein a few uv the changes:—</p>
               <p>"'So God creatid a <emph>white</emph> man in his own image.'</p>
               <p>"'Whosoever, therefore, shell confess me before <emph>white</emph> men,'
                  &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"'Suffer little <emph>white</emph> children to come unto me, for uv sich is the
                  kingdom uv Heaven.'"</p>
               <p>Wich last is comfortin, ez it shows that the distincshen is kept up through all
                  eternity. I give these merely ez samples. We shel hev it finisht in a few days,
                  and, ef funds kin be raised, shel publish it. Sich a vershun uv the Skripters is

               <p>I find the Demekratic mind is exercised over the question uv the succession to
                  Wade. My voice is for Vallandygum. Never wuz there sich a saint,<pb n="298-299"

                  minions of irresponsible power. He hez suffered for us, and now he must hev his
                  reward. It hez bin urged that the ten cent colleckshun in 1863 was suffishent pay
                  for his marterdom. I deny it. I know all about it. He got nothin uv it. Every
                  Demekrat in Ohio who hed taxes to pay, or who wanted a new pare uv pants, or whose
                  boots needed half solin, took up a colleckshun for Vallandygum. I know that's so,
                  for I wuz a Demekrat in Ohio, laborin under pekooniary embarasments in them days
                  myself. Let Vallandygum hev the place he so well earned.</p>

                  <dateline>POST OFFIS, CONFEDRIT X ROADS (Wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),
                     October 22, 1867.</dateline>
               </opener>
               <p>WE held, last nite, our formal jollification at the Corners, over the result uv
                  the Ohio and Pennsylvany elecshuns. It wuz a glorious occashen, and one wich wuz
                  calkelated to cheer the long deprest hearts uv the down-trodden Dimocrisy; wich it
                  did. The Church wuz gorgusly illoominatid with candles, hung in festoons in the
                  winders. Deekin Pogram, in honor uv the occashun, loaned us the yoose uv his two
                  keroseen lamps,—the pride uv the Corners,—wich wuz arranged in a tabloo in front
                  uv the pulpit, over wich wuz hung, in peeceful folds, the two Confedrit flags wich
                  Kernel McPelter's regment hed borne in honor over myriads uv ded<pb n="300-301"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000158"/> Yankees. The survivin heroes uv the Lost Coz in the
                  visinity wuz present, attired in their soiled uniforms, and everythin about the
                  demonstrashen wuz ez inspiritin ez it wuz possible to make it. Short and pertinent
                  addresses wuz made by the offishels uv the church, wich I wuz gratified to observe
                  a pious vane uv thankfulnis run thro em. Deekin Pogram shone with unwonted
                  brilliancy and on-paralleled devoutnis. He blessed the Lord for the mercy wich hed
                  bin vouchsafed us. The people uv the North hed vindicated the Skripters, and hed
                  bin weaned from their infidelity. Now he felt he cood wallop a nigger wunst more
                  in safety, and put his foot onto the necks uv the descendants uv Ham, wich wuz
                  ordained from the flood. He felt thankful for wat hed bin done for us by Ohio and
                  Pennsylvany, and he hoped for ez much from Noo York. Shood Noo York complete the
                  work so gloriously commenst by Maine and Californy, and so happily carried forrerd
                  by Ohio and Pennsylvany, then he shood say, "Now let thy servant depart in peese."
                  If he shood survive the joy uv the occashun, he wood to-wunst recapcher his
                  niggers,—sich uv em ez wuz still in the land uv the livin,—and redoose em to their
                  normal condishen. He wood hold em by force, trustin in the result uv the next
                  Presidenshel shel elecshun to ratify wat he hed done. He shood to-wunst buy up wat
                  he cood uv Confedrit skrip, for, bless the Lord, he felt now that the Lost Coz
                  wazn't ez much lost ez he thot it wuz.</p>
               <p>Other speeches wuz made, and the meetin, in a state uv high hilarity, adjourned to
                  Bascom's, wher we made a nite uv it. I survived, probably, the longest uv any uv
                  the square drinkers. There wuz those who held out longer by resortin to sich
                  on-manly subterfuges ez throwin their likker over their sholders and takin lite
                  drinks, but sich ain't for me. It looks, ez it is, like a throwing away uv the
                  good gifts uv nacher; a sacrificin the blessins uv life to a foolish pride,—suthin
                  I never will do.</p>
               <p>One by one I saw em droop and roll gently off the benches. Issaker Gavitt first,
                  McPelter next, Bascom next, and finally Deekin Pogram, like a giant oak in a
                  hurricane, tottered, rallied, tottered agin, and finally fell; and I, feelin that
                  my time, too, hed come, went under likewise. I slept, and sleepin, dreamed.</p>
               <p>Methawt I wuz in a vast bildin, constructid in the Orientle stile uv arketectoor,
                  to-wit: a roof, supported by pillers. These pillers wuz labelled with the names uv
                  battles fought doorin the Revolushen and the last war with Great Britten, the
                     strongest<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7103-00000159"/> and newest bein ticketed
                  with the battles fought doorin the late onpleasantnis.</p>
               <p>"Wat strukter is this?" askt I uv the janiter uv the institooshn.</p>
               <p>"The Temple uv Liberty!" ansered he.</p>
               <p>"Wilt show it me?" askt I.</p>
               <p>"With pleasure, Sir," sed he. "The present occupant uv the bildin, and he who now
                  hez controle uv it, is in an inner chamber. Woodst see him?"</p>
               <p>"I woodst," remarked I, and he showd me in.</p>
               <p>It wuz a pekoolyer seen. On the carpet on the floor was stretched the form uv a
                  Giant, hyer in stature, broader across the shoulders, deeper in the chest, and
                  possessin more indicashens uv strength and endoorance than any Giant I hed ever
                  seen. His face wuz ruther young lookin and noble, though onto it there wuz an
                  expression uv wearinis and sadniss. He wuz fast asleep, and sleepin ez a man does
                  after a terrible expenditoor uv physikle and mentle strength.</p>
               <p>"Who is this?" askt I uv my guide.</p>
               <p>"Republikinism!" sed he.</p>
               <p>"Ha! Wat is them wich he holds so lovinly in his arms?" askt I.</p>
               <p>"Them is the treasures uv the Temple, uv wich the okkupant thereof is ex-offisho
                  guardian. He hez only a part uv em in his arms—ef yoo notis, ther are ten uv em
                  under his heels."</p>
               <p>I looked carefully, and notist that they wuz all labelled with the names uv the
                  States—those in his arms wuz those uv the North, and the ten under his heels wuz
                  them wich hed unfortnitly failed in their attempt to get out uv the Temple. From
                  the heft uv his heel onto em, it appeared ez tho they were under a triflin
                  restraint. Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland he hed tightly gripped between his
                  thumb and finger.</p>
               <p>"Why sleeps he?" askd I.</p>
               <p>"Exhaustion," sed he. "Sich a fite ez he hez hed to retane possession uv this
                  place! Four long yeers hev opposin powers attempted by open hostilities to
                  dispossess him, doorin wich he wuz assaled at every pint, and for three years hez
                  politikle fite been made onto him, doorin wich he hez bin betrayed by them he
                  sposed wuz his chosen and trusted frends. Last year he hed a terrible conflict
                  with em and wuz victorious, but the strain wuz too heavy onto him, and he's bin
                  asleep, ever sence, recooperatin. Besides, some uv his attendin physicians, in
                  whom he hed confidence, proved to be quacks, and they dosed him with restoratives,
                     wich,<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7103-00000160"/> however good they mite be,
                  wuzn't percisely the remedy for the time, and they increesed the stupor under wich
                  he wuz laborin. Besides, he wuz attackt with sore head, and in adishen to all this
                  there wuz barnacles, and vampires, and blood-suckers uv all kinds, wich further
                  weakened him. Listen, how hard he breathes!"</p>
               <p>And he wuz a breathin hard.</p>
               <p>At this percise minit methawt the guide disappeared, and there wuz a agitashen uv
                  the curtins uv the chamber. Slowly they lifted, and to my surprise I saw feachers
                  wich I recognized. Vallandygum peered in, and seein that the Giant wuz still
                  asleep, come in on tip-toe, beckonin others to follow. They come. There wuz
                  Thurman, uv Ohio; Voorhees, uv Injiany; Florence, Shars-wood, and Jerry Black, uv
                  Pennsylvany; Seward, Fernandy Wood, and Morrissey, uv Noo York; and Johnson,
                  Pierce, Bookanan, and the whole glorious company of marters. Cautiously they krept
                  in, and timidly ranged themselves about the sleepin Giant, and communed among
                  themselves.</p>
               <p>"That wuz too heavy a load for him to carry at his age," chuckled Ben Wood, pintin
                  to an immense burden strapped to his sholders, on wich was written "Equality

               <p>"Yes," sed Johnson, "but he wood hev got throo with it, but I tripped him!"</p>
               <p>"It wuz I who put the stone down over wich he mostly stumbled," sed Seward in a
                  whisper.</p>
               <p>"To biznis!" sed Vallandygum. "Let us git wat we kin afore he awakens;" and he and
                  Thur-man slily fingered away Ohio, doin it without disturbin him much. He did
                  groan slitely, and moved uneasily. Sharswood and Jerry Black very adroitly slipped
                  Pennsylvania out from under his arm, and agin he started up restlessly, but sunk
                  back into his slumber agin.</p>
               <p>Emboldened by this, Fernando Wood and Seymour attempted to steal away Noo York,
                  wich wuz the piller onto wich his head restid; and while they wuz manooverin it,
                  he made a terrible noise, ez ef he wuz in agony.</p>
               <p>"It's the death rattle in his throat!" piped the ten Staits under his heels,
                  strivin to release their-selves.</p>
               <p>"It's the death rattle in his throat!" shreeked they all, throwin off all stealth,
                  and each grabbin a Stait.</p>
               <p>In an instant the scene changed. They hed overdid it. The Giant awoke, and
                  springin to his feet, glared fiercely onto em.</p>
               <p>"The death rattle, is it!" sed he, in a voice uv<pb n="306-307"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000161"/> thunder. "Ha! ha! you mistake the snorin uv a
                  hard-sleepin Giant for the death rattle! What hev I done? Sleepin so long, and
                  knowin all the time that assassins lurked around me!" Shakin the barnacles off, he
                  laid about him lively. He pitched Fernandy and Seymour out head over heels,—one
                  sweep uv his right arm disposed uv Pierce, Bookannan, and that pack, and then,
                  missin Ohio and Pennsylvany, he observed Vallandygum and Shars-wood makin off with
                  them. Utterin a howl uv rage, he sprang after em. Two leeps sufficed, and he
                  wrenched the States from their grasp, but not, however, ontil Vallandygum had bit
                  a thunderin slice out uv Ohio, and Sharswood one nearly ez large out uv
                  Pennsylvany.</p>
               <p>At this pint I awoke. The mornin sun wuz a sendin her brilliant beams thro the
                  winders uv Bascom's. Around me lay the prostrate forms uv Deekin Pogram, Bascom,
                  Captain McPelter, Issaker Gavitt, and the others who hed bin with me the nite
                  afore. They wuz a sleepin and a snorin ez peacefly ez men ever did. The doors hed
                  bin left open, and the villagers—the early birds who are alluz around ketchin the
                  worm—hed collected at the door. They did not vencher in, not knowin how sound
                  asleep we wuz, ontil—ez one uv em told me afterward— he hed seen a hog belongin to
                  Bascom walk in the open door and root about among us, gruntin approvinly, ez tho
                  it reminded him uv his childhood's day, wich indeed it did, ez he hed alluz bin
                  fed at a distillery; and then, satisfied that we wuz trooly asleep, they walked in
                  and helped themselves to refreshments at the bar. Turnin them out quietly, with a
                  stingin rebook for their dishonesty in takin advantage uv one helpless ez Bascom
                  wuz, I emptied the contents uv his drawer, and seekoorin it in my boot, lay down
                  ez tho I wuz asleep, till they shood awake. In an hour he awoke, and diskivered
                  that he hed bin gone thro.</p>
               <p>"Who cood hev done it?" sed he.</p>
               <p>"My dear friend," sed I, "yoo wuz injudishus enuff to leave your door open. See
                  ther!" and I pinted to the villagers a reelin thro the street. "They're virtuous,
                  but yoo put ther integrity to a test wich it coodent stand. Ther wuz too much
                  pressure to the square inch on ther conshences, and they collapst. Let it be a
                  warnin to yoo. I don't know that <emph>I</emph> cood hev resisted it, hed I
                  awakened first." And I awakened the Deekin, and helped him home, stayin with him,
                  uv course, to breakfast.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I WUZ a sittin in the Post Offis, day before yesterday, a cogitatin over the
                  glorious results uv the Ohio and Pennsylvany elections, and hopin for an ekally
                  good report from Noo York, thinkin the while that perhaps ef my hopes wuz
                  realized, and sich a Constooshnel Dimokrat ez Pendleton or Seymour shood be
                  elected, I mite, in considerashun uv my long, and I bleeve valuable services,
                  aspire to suthin higher, and better, and more profitable than a Post Offis, sich
                  ez I am at present holdin. I do not complain, for the posishen hez bin the means
                  uv establishin a credit upon wich I hev lived thus far comfortable; but yet I
                  shood prefer a place where the salary wood be suffishent to give me enuff so that
                  I cood lay up suthin for old age. The time is not far off when my individooel
                  exertions will not supply my wants.</p>
               <p>I felt good over the victory, and it seemed to me ez tho we ought to speak, ez
                  Kentuckians, to our brethren North, instructin uv em how to hold the Staits wich
                  they hev won for us. When I deside upon a pint I alluz act, and so it wuz this
                  time.</p>
               <p>I give notis, by Issaker Gavitt, that the Corners wood assemble at the tootin uv
                  the horn, for the purpose uv sendin forth the voice uv Kentucky to the Staits
                  North. The evenin come, the horn wuz tooted from the steps uv the church, and the
                  entire Corners wuz there. Deekin Pogram wuz in his regler seat; Issaker Gavitt wuz
                  in his sainted father's place, wich hez gone hentz. Kernel McPelter wuz there, and
                  also the others who make up the male population uv the Corners, and their wives.
                  It wuz a glorious meetin, and I wuz a rubbin my hands and feelin good at the
                  prospeck uv an improvin occashun, when, to my utter disgust, I saw the door open,
                  and Joe Bigler, who wuz born to be my pest, come in, with Pollock, and twenty or
                  twenty-five niggers, old and young, male and female, white, yaller, and black, and
                  all uv em took seats together<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7103-00000163"/> in the
                  corner uv the church. I knowd by the meek look uv the niggers, and the eggstreem
                  quietood uv Bigler hisself, that suthin wuz up, wich would uv course develop
                  itself. Bigler and Pollock generally develop.</p>
               <p>I opened the meetin by remarkin that the times wore an auspishus look. The power
                  uv the nigger in Amerikin politics hed bin demonstrated. The nigger hed bin so
                  manipulated in Ohio and Pennsylvany ez to give us these States, which we cood hold
                  ef we choose. But the Dimocrisy uv Ohio and Pennsylvany hed a work to do, wich
                  they cannot neglect with safety. They had declared the nigger inferior to the
                  Caucashen, wich he undeniably is, and they must keep him so. The nigger must be
                  kept jist eggsackly wher he is, to serve ez a irritant to Dimocrisy. Ohio gives
                  the niggers uv that State certain facilities for learnin to reed and write;
                  accomplishments wich no laborin class wich is to be guided, controlled, and worked
                  excloosively by a sooperior class, needs or hez any biznis with. So soon ez a man
                  begins to reed he begins to hev an inquirin mind, and begins to feel a
                  dissatisfaction with his speer. Let Ohio repeel these laws towunst, that the
                  niggers may not—"</p>
               <p>"Reverse the arrangement," sed Joe Bigler, risin, "and git to be the sooperior uv
                  the white. Is that it, Perfesser?"</p>
               <p>"Not eggsackly that," returned I, not knowin wat he wuz drivin at, "but ez Hevin
                  ordained the niggers to be inferior to us, and serve us, it looks rather dangerous
                  to—"</p>
               <p>"Give him a chance to rise? That's what yoor gettin at, I see. I am, and always
                  wuz a Dimocrat, ez yoo know; but I don't shudder from that cause—not any. I hev
                  faith in the Lord, wich yoo appear to lack, wich is strange, considerin yoor
                  profeshun. Ef my colored friends here wuz ordained by the Almighty to alluz okkepy
                  an inferior position to us, why, they'll do it anyhow, onless, indeed, we degrade
                  ourselves below ther level. Ef I understand yoor idea, it is that the proud
                  Caucashen is the only favored race, wich fixes its own posishen itself, and that
                  all the other races hed places assigned them, wich Godalmity hevin fixed, they
                  can't pass. That bein the case, wat's the yoose, Perfesser, uv our foolin away our
                  time a tryin to strengthen his laws by any act uv ours? Ef the Almighty fixed it
                  so, kin we do it any better than he?"</p>
               <p>"But spos'n the nigger, ef we don't keep him down by law, shood rise above
                  us?"</p>
               <p>"I shood unanimously conclood that ther hed bin<pb n="312-313"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000164"/> a mistake in the figgers, and that we wuz, after
                  all, the sons uv Ham and they the sons uv Japheth. How wood yoo like that? But
                  that ain't wat ails us. There, Perfesser, ain't where our danger is. Dimocrisy,
                  like a man with a tape-worm, carries the elements uv its own destruckshen.
                  Missegenashun is wat's sappin the foundashuns uv the party.—Agreein with yoo that
                  the nigger's place is fixed, and that the Dimocrisy coodent git along a minit
                  without the nigger, I here utter my solemn warning agin the continyooal lessenin
                  uv the race, becoz that race is our rock, and onto that we stand. Wat sense is
                  there in wastin our capital, or ruther dilutin it?"</p>
               <p>"Wat do yoo mean?" askt I, not gettin at the drift uv wat he wuz drivin at.</p>
               <p>"Mean! My meanin is plain. The blacker the nigger is, the further he is below us;
                  the whiter he is, the nearer our ekal he is. In this calculashun we don't take
                  intelligence, or virchoo, or anything of the kind into account, but perceed upon
                  the hypothesis that a devilish mean white man is considerable better than a smart
                  and honest nigger. Therefore, any drop uv white blood in a nigger's veins makes
                  him just one drop less objectionable. Look at the specimens wich I hev brought
                  with me to illustrate my pint. The light-colored niggers will rise."</p>
               <p>And every cussed one uv em got up, ez ef by majic, and I saw to-wunst wat he wuz
                  goin for.</p>
               <p>"Yoo see, Perfesser, I hev here twenty-two spiled niggers. Every one uv them ought
                  to hev bin the son or daughter uv two pure niggers, but they ain't. This one's
                  mother, for instance," and he laid his hand upon the shoulder uv a likely quadroon
                  uv eighteen years, "wuz wunst the property uv Deekin Pogram, wich circumstance
                  accounts for her hevin the Pogram nose and general cast uv countenance to an
                  alarmin degree, and—"</p>
               <p>Ther wuz a piercin shreek heard, and Mrs. Pogram was carried out faintin, and the
                  Deekin turned ez red ez a lobster, while Bigler, ez solemn ez a judge, went
                  on:—</p>
               <p>"This girl wuz wunst the property uv Deekin McGrath, who is, I notis, here
                  to-nite. Melissy, stand up," sed he, and a likely mulatto woman ariz. "You will
                  notis," sed he, "that Melissy is rather dark, while her girl, wich yoo see afore
                  yoo, is quite a half lighter. The race bleached out considerable on Deekin
                  McGrath's place. I hev, in my recollection, ten or fifteen more, uv various
                  shades, who hev the McGrath face, but—"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Deekin McGrath, utterin a shreek uv rage, swung out of the church, while the
                  Deekin towunst<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7103-00000165"/> wunst assoomed the color
                  uv his fellow Deekin, Pogram.</p>
               <p>"I mite go on; but wherefore? Yoo all see the pint. I kin show yoo, in this
                  colleckshun, wich I hev picked up, the pecoolyer feachers uv the Dingeses, the
                  McPelters, the Bascoms, and every family around these parts,—that is, the feechers
                  uv the male members uv em. But sence the emancipashun I hev notist that this thing
                  hez come to a sudden endin. I hev notist that sence the niggers hev owned
                  theirselves, there ain't no more uv this mixter. Yoo purpose, I suppose, agin
                  redoosin uv em to their normal condishun, and makin uv em menservants and
                  maid-servants. Ef this is done, let me entreet yoo, brethren, to stop the bleachin
                  process. Ef yoo hev any regard for the Dimocrisy, don't tolerate it no more. The
                  moment a half-white nigger is born, yoo can't enslave only half uv him; for only
                  half comes under the cuss, and only half under the laws agin niggers. That one
                  half keeps down to the Ham level, but tother half sores to the Japhet place in
                  nacher. Yoo can't whale a mulatto with only half the intensity yoo kin a
                  clear-blooded nigger; and when they keep bleachin out, and out, and out, ontil
                  they are almost white, what then? When a nigger is nine tenths Pogram, and only
                  one tenth nigger, what then? Kin the Deekin be so deaf to the voice uv nacher—so
                  bare uv impulse ez to oppress so much Pogram for the sake uv gettin his foot on so
                  little nigger? I can't beleeve it. Besides, when it's all run out—when the nigger
                  don't show at all—then wat is to prevent em from walkin off alone, and settin up
                  in biznis for themselves ez white men? What will become uv the Dimocrasy
                  then?"</p>
               <p>All this time the niggers wuz titterin, and the white women wuz gaspin for breath,
                  and the men wuz turnin red and white by turns. I arose to rebuke him, when Bigler
                  remarkt that he guest enuff hed bin sed, and that probably the meeting hed better
                  be adjourned. And the audacious cuss give us two minutes and a half to get out uv
                  the buildin.</p>
               <p>I wood give my next quarter's salary ef the yellow fever wood come to the Corners,
                  pervided I cood be ashoored that Bigler and Pollock wood be victims.</p>

               <p>THE Corners wuz prostrated with joy last nite at the receet uv the news uv the
                  November elecshuns. Ther wuz nothin demonstrative about our joy ez there hed bin
                  on occasions uv less interest. No! the result wuz too great, too overwhelminly
                  great! Our nachers wuz filled with joy, and it bubbled up to the eyes, and slopt
                  over in floods uv teers. Deekin Pogram's dawter Mirandy borrered a tamborine, wich
                  wood answer for a timbrel, and attempted to dance down the street, after the
                  fashion uv Miriam, singin, "Shout the glad tidens," et settry, but we rebookt her.
                  Sich exultashen seemed to us inadekate. The Deekin met me, and fallin onto my
                  neck, wept perfoosely down my back, wich I stood ez long ez I cood bear the
                  moistyer. Gently disengagin him, I led him to Basom's, fearin that so great a
                  waste uv flooids wood cut short the old saint's life, unless that waste cood be
                  repaired. We supplied the deficiency to-wunst. Never saw I sich a picter. The
                  blessid old man sittin onto a bench, a glass uv hot whiskey in his hand; his white
                  hair a fallin scantily about his temples, and tears a running in rapid succession
                  adown his frost-bitten nose, and, glitterin a moment on the tip, droppin, like
                  strings uv pearls, into the space below! It wuz tetchin!</p>
               <p>The citizens met that evening, not to rejoice, but to adopt sich measures for
                  turning the victry to account ez the occasion seemed to demand. The Deekin wuz
                  there, and I beleeve every white male citizen uv the Corners wuz in his seet afore
                  the glad peals uv the bell hed ceased pealin. I assoomed the chair, and in a few
                  joodishus remarks stated the objeck uv the meetin. Noo York, I remarkt, hed
                  spoken, and Noo Gersey, the blessed State uv which I hed the honor to be a native,
                  hed returned to her fust love. I wuz not now ashamed to own that I wuz a native of
                  Noo Gersey. I am proud uv it, and were it not for the fact that I owe neerly half
                  uv her citizens, in sums rangin from a half dollar up to eighteen, I wood return
                  there to-wunst. But<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7103-00000167"/> I won't. It wood
                  awaken expectations in their buzzums wich wood never be fulfilled, and I'm too
                  tender-hearted, too considrit uv the feelins uv others, to lasserate them feelins.
                  I can't properly express my emoshuns. Thank Heaven the nigger is ourn. The
                  Northern States have spoken, and in thunder tones. The Ethiopian wunst wuz on the
                  top wave, but wher is he now? Two years ago he wuz needed—but now wher is he? The
                  Ablishnists don't need him no more to fill up ther quotas, they don't need him no
                  more to take ther places in the next draft, and thank the Lord he's the same d—d
                  nigger he alluz wuz! The stink uv the nigger hez overcome ther gratitood to
                  him—ther good feelin hez bin swamped by ther prejoodis. The Dimocrasy uv the two
                  sections uv the Yoonion hez rusht into each other's arms, the nigger wuz between
                  em, and consekently is under our feet. What happinis for Kentucky! The nigger
                  can't go North with the elecshen returns starin him in the face, and ef he stays
                  here he must stay on our terms. Thank the Lord.</p>
               <p>Deekin Pogram sed that he hednt felt so good sence his first wife died. He felt
                  too good to speek, and the brethren wood excuse him ef his remarks shood be breef.
                  (We will! We will! with great yoonanimity.) Four weeks ago, when he heerd from
                  Ohio and Pennsylvany he hed to-wunst drawd up a skedule uv the loss that hed bin

               <p>This bill he hed determined to put in, becoz uv this property he hed bin robbed.
                  Last nite he heerd uv the result uv the Noo York and Noo Jersey elecshuns, and he
                  felt that more yit wuz due him from the unconstooshnel government under wich we
                  are forst to live. He wanted pay, not only for his twenty-four thousand dollars'
                  worth of nigger, but<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7103-00000168"/> legle interest on

                  he considered greenbax jist ez unconstooshnel ez emancipashen.</p>
               <p>Issaker Gavitt remarkt, that on behalf uv his father's estate he hed a claim on
                  the oppressors. He hed made out no bill ez yit, ez the nigger wich alluz did the
                  figgerin for his father hed got to be impudent, and wooden't do it no more. But he
                  shood get somebody who cood write to copy the Deekin's bill, wich wood answer, ez
                  the two farms workt about the same number uv hands, tho uv fancy stock his father
                  hed alluz kept the most, wich accountid for his bein more bald-headed than the
                  Deekin.</p>
               <p>Kernel McPelter wantid no pay. He wantid his niggers. To accept pay wood be to
                  acknollege the right uv a Illinoy goriller to releese em, wich he wood never do.
                  He hed one—he saw her to-day—wich he wood hev back agin. Her and her husband, wich
                  hed bin married sence they wuz torn from him, hed purchist ten akers uv ground up
                  toards Garrettstown, and wuz a livin onto it. Uv course, ez the emancipashun was
                  illegal, the produx uv their labor sence that time wuz hizzen, jest the same ez
                  though they remained in their normal con dishen. The ten akers woodent make him
                  good, but they hed two children born to em sence, wich, ef niggers brot any price,
                  wood do suthin toards it.</p>
               <p>Bascom perferred to hev Government pay ther valyoo, and let em stay free. He had
                  arrived at this conclushun after givin the subjeck matoor considerashen. They all
                  hed some property now—leastways they could all do wat they pleased with their
                  money. Troo, the heft uv the proceeds uv their labor went to Pollock for dry
                  goods, and groceries, and sich, but he bleeved that they wuz a imitative race. Ef
                  so, and they followed the eggsample sot em by their white sooperiors, they wood,
                  in time, leave the heft uv it at his bar. He hed a few uv em under trainin now,
                  and he notist that they wuz better customers than the whites, ez they didn't
                  swaller their rashens and tell him to "jist chalk it down."</p>
               <p>A sense uv the meetin wuz then taken, and a majority voted to fust try to redoose
                  them to their normal condishen, and ef that wuz decided to be impracticable, then
                  we cood, with still better grace, demand their valyoo uv the Goverment.</p>
               <p>"Yes," exclaimed Kernel McPelter, "and for<pb n="322-323"
                     xml:id="VAC7103-00000169"/> this great work ther is no better time than now.
                  'The Yoonyun ez it wuz! Foller me!"</p>
               <p>And forthwith the entire congregashun piled out, rushin toward the nigger
                  settlement on the Garretts-town road.</p>
               <p>Arrivin at the settlement, a consultashen wuz held. It wuz desided that I shood
                  advance to the doors uv the houses and demand surrender, but I declined. Kernel
                  McPelter volunteered, and we all awaited the result. He knocked at the door uv the
                  first house.</p>
               <p>"Wha' d'ye want?" exclamed a voice.</p>
               <p>"I want yoo!" said the Kernel.</p>
               <p>"Wa' foah?"</p>
               <p>"My friend," sed the Kernel, impressively, "ef I recognize yoor dulcet tone, yoor
                  my nigger. Four years ago yoo wuz set free, you sposed, by Linkin; but we've done
                  away with that. Come forth, and give yoorself up; you shel, ef yoo go peaceably,
                  hev yoor old quarters agin, and be treated ez uv old."</p>
               <p>"Go way, white man, and stop yoor foolin. Dis nigga 's in bed!"</p>
               <p>"Break down the doors!" yelled the Deekin, "and hev done with it!" and a rush wuz
                  made.</p>
               <p>The doors wuz broke down, and in a minit the nigger and his wife, and two
                  children, wuz out in the street, bound, and the Kernel hed the furnitoor packt,
                  ready to take to his own house. In the mean time assaults hed bin made on two
                  other houses, with ruther different results. Deekin Pogram led one on the house uv
                  a former slave uv hizzen, and wuz disabled by a charge uv shot in his leg, and the
                  infooriated nigger threw open the winder and swore that he'd empty tother barrel
                  into the head uv the first man who came within range. The whole settlement wuz by
                  this time alarmed, and lites sprang up, and we cood hear the click of the cocks uv
                  muskets, and the pilin up uv furnitoor afore the doors. It wuz desided that the
                  attempt to re-enslave em be given over for that nite, and carryin the Deekin, who
                  wuz weak from loss uv blood, we made our way to the Corners agin.</p>
               <p>The result demonstrated to me the impossibility uv the two races livin together in
                  harmony. There is a natral antagonism between em wich must result inevitably in a
                  war uv races, onless the status uv the two races is fixed by onalterable law. It
                  can't be denied that, so long ez they are among us, so long shel we be tempted to
                  subdoo em, and so long will sich sole-harrowin scenes ez that uv last nite result.

                  President, and the unconstitooshnel acts uv a Rump Congress is done away with, all
                  this will be fixt. It is this that soothes the Deekin, and enables him to endoor
                  his sufferins.</p>
