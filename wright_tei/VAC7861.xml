Down by the hazel copse at evening blazed The gipsy's fagot-there we stood and gazed; Gazed at her sunburnt face with silent awe! Her tattered mantle and her hood of straw; Her moving lips, her cauldron brimming o'er; The drowsy brood that on her back she bore, Imps ig the barn, with mousing owlet bred, From rifled roost at nightly revel fed: Where dark eyes flashed through locks of blackest shade, When ia the breeze the distant watch-dog bayed; And heroes fled the Sibyls muttered call, Whose elfin prowess scaled the orchard wall. As o'er my palm the silver piece she drew, And traced the line of life with searching viewf How throbbed my fluttering pulse with hopes and fears, To learn the color of my future years!--Rogers. IT is the Derby day-the great carnival of Protestant England; the saturnalia of free-born Britons; when the village of Epsom    is, for the time, elevated into supreme importance above all other villages, towns, and cities; when London, Paris, and St. Petersburg are nothing and no- where, and Epsom is all and- all-the capitol of England, the metropolis of the world, the centre of the solar'system,: the centripetal power of all animated nature, and of all civilized life, attracting all surrounding creation with irre-- sistible force to itself.            -       - (23)  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7861-00000003"/> 24    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. It is the day when horse-jockeys are mightier than monarchs, and horses a higher order of being than man; when all questions of merely human or national interest are crowded out by the one all-engrossing subject of thought and conversation; when our relations with France, the condition of India, the income-tax, the change of ministry, are the merest trifles beside the absorbing question of- - "Who is to win the Derby?"  ; The Emperor Napoleon may be the greatest statesman of the age, with an inscrutable purpose that we would be glad to discover, but he is not the winning horse to-day, and though his dark policy may be big with the fate of Europe, it is not fraught with the destinies of the Derby. India is a subject of anxious importance; but after all India is not Epsom. Direct and indirect taxation are troublesome questions, but they have nothing to do with our sweepstakes. So, to the land of shadows all these subjects; for one day the Derby is every thing, and every thing else is nothing. Epsom Heath, on the Derby day, is a scene impossible to conceive by those who have never seen it. It -is a concentrated quintessence of the world with all its passions and objects, its hopes and fears, its loves and hatreds, its jealousies and rivalries, its joys and sorrows, its disappointments and triumphs. It is a vast collection of all that is most exciting and most depressing, most delightful, and most distressing in civilized life. Here- on Epsom Heath and Hill are gathered together a great multitude of people, that in its vastness and incon- gruity reminds one of another great multitude that will be assembled -upon another day, for another purpose, when the only distinction of rank will be the simple and the final one' that separates for ever the evil from the good. Here are brought together all ranks, from that of royalty   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHEOY.        25" downl through every intermediate grade, to the beggar who wanders listlessly about, scarcely;hoping to gather from this joyous crowd, the poor Loon of a-penly or a crust. The hill is covered with hundreds of open barouches, filled with splendidly attired ladies and gentlemen, all in gay conversation and eager anticipation of the great race- of the day. All the heath, between the hill and the race- course, is mottled over with vehicles of every possible de- scription, from the brougham of the gentleman to the donkey-cart of the costermonger, and with booths, and apple-stalls, gipsy tents, and professors of every art and imposition, from thimble rig to fortune-telling. But the most exciting object of the whole scene, is the grand stand where the betters are making up their books-where those haggard men who stake their whole fortunes upon the wind and limb of untried horses, know that in- another hour they must be enriched or ruined. Outside the race-course the ground for miles around is still covered with a vast concourse of men, women, and children, horses, -dogs, and donkeys, carriages, carts, and wagons, booths, stalls, and tents. Beyond this outer circle, every leading highway. is thronged miles deep with more men, women, and children, more horses, dogs, and donkeys, and more carriages, carts, and wagons, all pressing on towards the .scene of action, all blockading each other at the turnpike-gates, and cheer- ing or swearing at each other as they crush past. But it is not with the toil, turbulence, and noise of these radii of the outer circles that we have to do, but. with the very centre itself-with the cool, airy, ,commanding hill, covered, but not crowded, with hundreds of open barouches and their fair occupants.              . On one of the best front sites upon this hill, and between, two coronetted carriages, stood a large, clean, substantial.  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7861-00000004"/> 26,    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. brake, a thing much more convenient for its present pur" pose than any other sort of carriage could possibly be. This brake was occupied by a family party which seemed  to consist of a father and four handsome daughters, but was in reality a bachelor uncle and four nieces. Three of these were large, blonde girls, showily dressed and full of talk and laughter. The fourth was smaller and darker, of a more elegant figure and plainer garb. She sat beside her uncle on the back seat, and while her companions chattered and giggled with girlish gayety, she surveyed the scene around her with grave thoughtfulness. The old man, after roaring aloud at some flippant speech Of one of the young ladies, suddenly turned to his silent niece, and said-- "Well, my dear Constance, what do you think of the Derby, eh?  How serious you are I I hope those highly respectable old ladies at Brussels haven't turned you into a sort of Protestant nun, have they? You don't answer. Come, what do you think of the Derby, eh?" "In truth, more than I can tell you at once, uncle," re- plied the young girl. "Gay, dashing, inspiring scene, isn't it, eh? Can't be beat in the world--the Derby.  Why, girl, look around you. People from all quarters of the globe come here just to see the Derby; nbt only from all parts of Europe, but from across seas, from America; and your cousins here, the plagues of my life, wouldn't miss the Derby-day for a set of rare diamonds.   Fine, joyous, enlivening scene. Don't you think so, eh, Constance, my little novice?' "Very joyous for Dives, very sorrowful for Lazarus," murmured Constance, in a low, thoughtful voice, as her eyes rested upon a magnificent barouche on their left, where a splendidly arrayed party were regaling themselves upon a sumptuous luncheon, served by liveried footmen,   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECT.      27 while around and under the carriage crawled three half- naked and half-starved boys, literally gathering up the crusts and bones that fell from the banquet above, and gnawing them with the voracity of famished wolves. And this striking modern illustration of Dives and Laza- rus was repeated in and around every barouche where the millionaire feasted and the starving grovelled. This was one of the sights of the-Derby. It was very painful to unaccustomed eyes, and those of Constance filled with tears. Those of Colonel North were hardened by habit, but even they twinkled to conceal a little moisture, as he said- "Yes, yes, my dear Constance, I know it looks very sad; but God bless your tender heart, it isn't near so sad as it looks I Even those little wretches are the happier for the Derby-day. They admire all the glory, mingle with all the excitement, have an opinion as to which is to be the win- ning horse, and get up a ha'penny sweepstake among themselves, no doubt I aye, and are the better for those luxurious banquets which contrast so painfully with their starvation; for if there were no feast in the barouche for Dives there would be no sweet crusts and rich bones on the ground for Lazarus. And that reminds me that every one else being at lunch, it is quite time for us to begin ours, if we mean to finish it before the horses start for the Derby.- As for myself, -I am so sharp set I could eat a crocodile I What the deuce are we waiting for, girls?" {For Lord Starr and Captain Starr, who promised to join us, you know, uncle," said the eldest Miss Horton. "Oh, aye, yes to be sure; where can they be? at the betting-ring I do suppose, deep in their betting-books; no, by Jove, here they come, the captain with the trophies of Aunt Sally adorning his hat.  David, you villainI David, you lazy loon, where are you? Come, serve up I serve up!"  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7861-00000005"/> 2$    THE A GIPSY'S 'PROPHE-CY. The '   zy loona" thus adjured, came forward from behind the brake, Ibearing aloft a huge hamper, which he deposited withn the vehicle before his master. The hamper was speedily unpacked of its contents, con- sisting first of a small service of china, glass, silver, cutlery, ana napkins, and next of a Westphalian ham, a pair of roast fowls, a pigeon pie, a salad, condiments, tarts, jellies, cakes, fruits, and wines-kin a word, of provisions enough to, dine a Iarge party sumptuously; for Colonel North al- ways came provided to lunch at least half a dozen bachelor fiendpds in addition to his own circle. As the viands were taken out and deposited about as the capabilities of the roomy brake permitted, two gentlemen -walked up, and lifting their hats, saluted our party. The elder, a tall, fine-looking man of fifty, was cordially greeted by the colonel and the three young ladies, and then formally presented to Constance as- "Lord Starr, of Starr Court, in Hampshire." Lord Starr bowed profoundly. Constance half arose and slightly curtsied. "This, I may say, is my niece Constance's debut in the world I Singular scene for a young lady's first appeal sane;e but the fact is I have just. brought her from her school in Brussels, where she has been passing the last fve years; and I thought before taking her home to Llyndell, I would just. stop a day or two in London to bring her to the Derby.  I telegraphed for her cousins to join us, and here they are, and here we   are," said Colonel North, jovially. Lord Starr bowed again, and expressed his satisfaction in making her acquaintance, The younger was an elegante of some twenty-two years, who was presented as  "  Captain Starr, of the Horse Guards." "Come in, come in, gentlemen! there is plenty of room   T HE  GIPSY'S PROPHECT.  in our brake, in which matter it has a. decided aavnntage over the finer-looking carriages around us. Come in; it is ill standing to feed!" said the colonel, heartily. But Lord Starr and the young guardsman excused them- selves, and declared that they preferred standing, where they could attend upon the ladies, whom they could by no means be induced to incommode by entering the brake. Meanwhile plates, knives, napkins, and glasses, were distributed, and the business of lunching commenced. ' -earnest. The conversation of course turned upon the prospective winning horse, and equally of course every one knew which that was to be--the favorite, "Annihilator," and no other. Every one agreed to this; that is, every one except Miss Fanny Horton, who, as she picked a pigeon-wing, laid down the law as follows: "Well I am not learned in horsey lore, as you gentle. men of the turf are expected to be, but this one thing I have noticed in my last ten years' annual visits to the 'Derby  " "Ten years, Miss Fanny!" ejaculated Lord Starr, with a flattering incredulity. "Yes, ten years, sir; I am getting on the- old. maid's list, Lord Starr." "My dear -Miss Fanny, I am shocked I But, upon my honor, I assure you it is no fault of mine," said his lord. ship, bowing. "Nor of mine, 'pon rmy soul!" echoed Captain Starr.  "Nor of hers, I'll engage to say I Eh, Fan I Ha, ha, ha!" chuckled- her uncle. "Nonsense!" exclaimed Miss Fanny, blushing, half in anger and half in amusement. "I was about to say, for your instruction, that in the ten years that I have been visiting the Derby-namely, from the time I was ten years old, when I saw my first race, to the present day, when I  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7861-00000006"/> r80    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. sm waiting to see this, I never knew the favorite horse to win the Derby I There I that is the fruit of my tree of knowledge I so that I would take any horse at a venture, and bet on him in preference to the favorite one!" All present seemed quite struck with the acuteness of Miss Fanny's observation, which they immediately began to compare with their own experiences, when their atten- tion was called off by the appearance of the wretched boys, who, having gleaned all they could get from the left-hand barouche, now came shily towards the brake, and began looking down on the ground, with hungry .eyes, in search of bones and crusts. Our party had finished their meal, and David had re- ceived orders to clear away, when Colonel North, catching sight of these hungry little vagrants, called out.-- "Here, David I give me that hamper a moment." David restored the hamper to its place, and his master, plunging his hand down into it, fished up a pigeon pie, and bending over the brake, called the hungry boys, say- ing- "Here, little fellows I fake this, and get under the brake to eat it!"' Three: pair of little hands seized the incredible prize, and three starved little figures popped down under the carriage to devour it. How like ravenous wolves they ate I They were soon joined by three or four other little Arabs of their tribe, and a squabble commenced over the remains of the pasty. "Good Lord!" exclaimed uncle John, as he plunged his hand once more in the hamper, and fished up a roast fowl-- "Here, you little Bohemians! stop clapper-clawing each other, and divide this among you 1" Half a dozen pair of claws seized the fowl, which was quickly torn to pieces among them. "Saints in glory! I was ever any thing like it I Here,   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        81 you small Philistines!"  And Colonel North dived once more into the hamper, and handed down the Westphalian ham and a loaf of bread, which were seized and disposed- of as were the others. "'Angels and ministers of grace defend us ' I say girls, they will eat us all up, body and bones I men, women, and brake!" excalimed the colonel in dismay, as he plunged once more into the hamper, and brought hp a bundle of sandwiches. But here old David pulled such a long and lugubrious face, that the eldest Miss Horton laid her hand firmly upon the bundle, and said- "No, no, uncle John I 'justice before generosity I' don't give the last morsel away! Remember David has not had his dinner yet." ( David? David quo' she? Let David dine on bread and cheese for once in a way; it will do him good!"And over went the sandwiches among the little sharks. And down dropped David's jaw in consternation. "David I David I there is still half a pigeon pie and half a roast fowl left in the hamper, run away with it while times are good," said Miss Horton. And David lost no time int obeying. Colonel North had no opportunity of objecting, for just at this moment an universal excitement moved the vast multitude, as the wind moves the leaves of a great forest, and the words went around- "They are about to start!" repeated at the same instant by many thousand voices. Every one stood up in breathless excitement. All necks were stretched, and all eyes turned towards the starting point. Another instant and a cry went up from that great mul- titude-  "They're off I They're off "  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7861-00000007"/> THE-, GIPSVT7S  PROPHECY.  And they are off--some twenty or thirty horses-the best of all three-year-old colts in the whole civilized world I They come I They come I they rush on! urged by their jockeys in green caps, red caps, yellow caps, blue caps, all caps l Oh,!Ieaven I what an' interval of thrilling suspense I Fifty thousand people are on their feet, breathless, eager, expectant I There, on the grand stand, are men who have staked their all upon this race, with faces like those of maniacs- pale, haggard, anxious, agonized--another minute will en. rich or ruin them. Not a word is spoken amid the breathless multitude. The horses rush on and on, like a whirlwind, sublime in their irresistible might I And now the breathless silence is broken by shouts of- "Annihilator's ahead!" Invincible's past him!" "Fleetfoot is first!" When suddenly an ordinary-looking, unnoticed horse. behind shoots forward, passes the field, and is first in by half the length of his body. A groan from one half the multitude I -Dead silence, and the collapse of despair for the other. A few knowing men had made their fortunes. Many were utterly ruined and desperate. A low, half-suppressed cry was heard from the splendid coronetted carriage on the left of our brake. The loveliest woman in that bevy of lovely women had fainted. "It is the Countess Ainslie; she had staked seventy thousand  pounds  on Annihilator, and has lost all," whispered a voice near. Aye I she had lost seventy thousand pounds on the Derby! But that was not all. She lost her husband, who never forgave the unsuccessful error I She lost her host   THE  GIPSY'S 'PROPHECY S 33' of summer friends, who hastened to forsake the impov- erished and discarded wife I And she lost her own young: life, which in a few months after sunk broken-hearted to the grave!  There was a rushing of men towards the grand stand.  '"What is the matter?" inquired Colonel North of a policeman, who was hurrying past. "Captain Trentham has blown his brains out; he ost a round hundred thousand on the favorite," answered -the policeman, without stopping an instant on his way. And these catastrophes, shocking upon any other occa- sion, passed as matters of course in the madness of 'the Derby Day'l "Whose horse won? What was the name of the winning horse?" were the next questions heard all over the ground. Every one referred to their card, but no one could tell until the figure was up. Then the ten thousand voices exclaimed at once- "Mr. Jones's Muff t who would have thought it l" Aye I who would have thought it? Who would have thought that the " little corporal" ever would Fhave been Emperor of France and half the rest of the world? Nevertheless, the little corporal did, in the year eighteen[ hundred- and four, found a dynasty, and Mr. Jones's Muff, did, in eighteen hundred and something, win the Derby I And both are immortalized. The great interest of the day was over; but there were some two or three minor races to be run, and people were too much excited to go home: so though the royal party withdrew, the multitude remained to see it all out. Lord Starr and Captain Starr, lifting their hats, bade adieu to our party, and departed to see how their friends of the betting-ring were sustaining their misfortunes or triumphs; and Colonel North was left alone with his nieces, to- listen to the exultation of "Miss Fanny, who crowed   &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7861-00000008"/> 84    THE Ga-PSY'S PROPHECY. loudly over the fact that her theory of races was proved, in that Muff, the insignificant horse, had confounded human wisdom on the turf by winning the Derby. Meanwhile Constance, whose feelings had been pro- foundly moved by all that she had seen and heard, sat back in deep thought, that was at length interrupted by a well modulated voice, close to her ear, saying-. "Tell your fortune, sweet lady?" Constance started, and looked up to- behold at her elbow one of those gipsy crones that infest all public gatherings to pick up silver by telling fortunes. Constance was about to decline the offer, when three fair hands were suddenly extended, and three eager voices exclaimed- "Tell mine I tell mine I tell mine, gipsy 1" "One at a time, pretty dears," said the old gipsy, leav, ing the side of Constance and coming around to that of Miss Horton. In turn she scanned the palms of the three fair sisters, And in turn, and with little variation in 'her story, she promised them the blessings supposed to be craved by young ladies, and which, indeed, their own blooming faces might have partly insured, namely--rich husbands, fine children, and long lives; promises which the laughing girls declared were purchased cheaply at half-a-crown each. "And now," said the gipsy, whose voice and smile were like a benediction, "I want to tell that sweet lady's fortune.^ "No, no," said Constance, shrinking from her. "Aye, but I dol Sweet lady, I read strange matter written on your brow," persisted the gipsy, fixing her thrilling black eyes upon the face of Constance, who shud- :;dered, she knew not why, as she said- Oh, pray go away I .There is a crown for you."' "Nay, but, sweet lady, let- the old gipsy cross your palm   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHEsCY.      36 with this broad piece, that she may read and warn you of the ill fate that threatens, and the sure way to avoid. it. The dark, wild beauty of the gipsy's face, and the ear- nestness of her manner, impressed Constance even against her own reason and judgment. She trembled as she answered- "You are in the habit of prophecying' smooth things' to your customers. Why do you speak of an ill fate to me?" "Lady, the awful hand of Fate has written that upon  your brow which I would interpret by the lines of your hand." "Oh, pray do not; pray leave me; if you possess the art of foretelling the future it is sinful to exercise it; if you do not, it is still more sinful to pretend to it," said Constance. "It is no pretence, lady I Ages before the time when your Mosaic record dates the creation of the world, the ancient fathers of our wandering tribes were entrusted with the great mystery of knowing the future as the past. This dower has come down to us through countless ages. And we, wanderers over the face of the earth, who have lost .all things else, have retained our awful gift.

"Nay, sweet lady, it is not a sin tod use any faculty' with which the Creator has endowed us."

Constante, to end the scene, held out her hand, saying-- There, read what you find there." The gipsy took and carefully scrutinized the palm ex- posed to her view; and as she gazed upon it, her own dark and eloquent face became convulsed as by some agonizing emotion. She dropped the. hand of the girl, and gazed mournfully into her face. "Well," said Constance, '   what do you read?" "' Lady, I cannot, dare not read aloud the awful lines that fate has written on your hand," said the gipsy, gazing fixedly upon the face of her whom she had now completely magnetized. "Gipsy," said Constance, bending forward, and speaking in a low, beathless tone, "I know not how much or how little you may really possess of that awful gift you claim, but I am now willing to test it.

He could not rest, he felt for him One such his God created, Whose maiden soul in quietude On his call meekly waited.--B. Oakes Smth. THE locality of our story lies amid one of the wildest an'l most picturesque regions of South Wales, where the head waters of the Rhai river rise amid the Oloff Hills. The precise spot, Crucis, is a sublime and beautiful scene, where two wooded ranges of hills cross each other at oblique angles. At the intersecting point of these ridges stands a little ancient-chapel, called St. Andrew's Church, and around the chapel nestles a little hamlet, named, from its elevated position, Bleakton. At the period at which our story opens, the four estates, in the four angles of the irregular mountain cross, were owned as follows:-- The eastern one,. called Llyndell, was the life property of Mrs. Horton, a lady of the old school. The western, and most valuable one, was the inheritance N Miss Wynne, an orphan heiress, grand-daughter and *rdw of Mrs. Borton.   THnE GIrt'SY   PR OPHEe o C, . a9 The northern and smallest one, called, from being the deepest vale of the four, Horne's Holq, was the property of old Hugh Horne, a widower, of gloomy temper, parsi- monious habits, and almost fabulous wealth. The southern one, named, from the extravagant cost of the elegant mansion-house, elaborate out-buildings, and highly-ornamented grounds, which had absorbed the means of the late owner, ' Radnor's Ruin," was the heavily- mortgaged patrimony of Gerald Ross Mostyn, the grand- son of Mr. Horne, and now a young aspirant for honors at the University of Oxford. But little benefit to the heir was to be hoped from the inheritance of his father's burthened property. In the first place, old Hugh Horne had bought up in his own name all the claims against the estate of Radnor's Ruin, doubtless to prevent a foreclosure, and to save the property for his grandson. But unhappily, Gerald had mortally offended the des- potic old- man, by declining an agricultural life, and per- sisting in the study of a profession-,a course that had re" sulted in his own disinheritance.  To make this punishment more bitter to his grandson the old man had taken into favor his nephew, Mr. James Horne, whom he had- established near himself at Radnor's Ruin. At this time, the disinherited heir, having finished a term at the university, had come down to spend a part of his vacation in -his native place. As no hospitable mansion was likely to be thrown open to the almost penniless young student, he also received "his warmest welcome in an inn." It was upon the Saturday evening of his arrival that he found the little hotel, and, indeed, the whole village of Bleakton, in a great state of excitement, from the fact that the celebrated heiress, Miss Wynne, had just stopped there, and passed through on her way home.:  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7861-00000011"/> 40    THE  GIPSYlS  PROPHECY. Gerald had known her as a child, but that was years ago, and her very form and features had passed from his mismory; nevertheless, he at first listened, as an idle travel- ler will, to the gossips around him. Those who had been so happy as to catch a glimpse of her face, vied with each other in praise of her many charms, while those who had not, listened with eagerness, and lookedlforward to indemnifying themselves by seeing her at church the next morning. Now, Gerald Mostyn had a strong prejudice against "fine ladies," and this one formed no exception to his antipathy. He despised the vulgar eclat that expended - itself upon the merely adventitious circumstances of personal beauty, great wealth, and fine dress. And all this fuss made about Miss' Wynne shared his con- tempt. "Well," he said, within himself, "to-morrow, at morn- ing service, I, too, shall have an opportunity of seeingsthis 'marvellous' fine lady, this heiress, beauty, muse, saint; and I shall find her a high-complexioned, expensively- arrayed young woman, full of boarding-school graces and fashionable piety 1 She will read her prayers from a gilt- edged book, and put a gold piece in the purse, so that all may see that she is 'saint' as well as 'muse, beauty, and heiress.' Bah I fie upon tinsel glitter; fie upon false shows I If ever I marry, it will be some poor girl. Oh, for my ideal woman I oh, for my gifted daughter of toil-my nature's queen!" thought our hero, as, half in loathing of the popular truckling to mere rank and wealth, half in as- piration towards the angel of his secret visions, he saun- :ered' out of the house and strolled towards the forest. The", next" morning being the Sabbath, Gerald Mostyn, ,who seldom absented- himself from divine service, arose ,early, dressed, breakfasted, and set forth upon a walk of three miles down the hills, in other words, from Bleakton   THE  GIPSY^S PROPHECY.        41 to Llyndell, where flourished Christ Church, in the parish of Crucis. But with sauntering, loitering, and looking from favor- able points upon the familiar prospect, it was late when he reached the foot of the hills, where, in the lower skirt of the forest, stood the church. , The churchyard was filled with carriages of every variety, from the coach and pair to the dog-cart, from the family carry-all to the single gig, and from the old dame's donkey to the squire's steed. But no human being except two young grooms, each left in charge of particularly wild horses, remained in the yard. All had passed into church, where the service had already commenced. Gerald Mostyn, hat in hand, waited reverentially until the opening prayer was concluded, and then as reverently entered, passed up the aisle, and took his seat in a vacant side-pew, at the right hand of the pulpit, which commanded not only preacher, but the whole congregation. And while the minister -was giving out the somewhat lengthy hymn, Gerald Mostyn naturally permitted his eyes to wander over the assembly. It was emphatically a country congregation. There in the lower end of the church, near the doors, and along the side walls, was the usual quantum of old-fashioned men and women, in coats and bonnets of a style much in voguei half a century ago. There, about the centre of the build- ing, were aged gentlemen  and   gentlewomen, thrifty matrons, and rustic bells and beaux. - And, higher up, near the pulpit, were the old and wealthy families, and so-called more important families," the aristocrats of the country.  Here, occupying the large pew immediately before the pulpit, were the Hortons. From his seat at the right hand of the pulpit, Gerald had a full view of this party. In the end nearest, to him sat three gayly-attired and blooming girls, whose hoops, crinolines, and ample skirts  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7861-00000012"/> 42    T  E GI PSY'S  PROPrEECY. filled the whole space. These young women he easily identified as the Horton- ladies. He narrowly serutinised them to see if he could discover which was the" great heir- ess, M-as Wynne. All there were very pretty, according to the wax-doll standard of beauty, with rounded and slender forms, white skins, pink cheeks, blue eyes, and yellow curls. They were dressed according to the wax-doll standard of taste-in mauve-colored bareges, with many flounces, and small bon- nets, with a profusion of flowers. With a strong family likeness among them, it was diffi- cult to distinguish the heiress, Miss Wynne, from her cousins, the Misses Horton. But at length Gerald fixed upon the one at the upper- end of the pew as Miss Wynne. He came to the opinion in this manner--first, because her form was taller and rounder, her skin whiter, her cheeks pinker, her eyes bluer, and her curls yellower than those of her companions; secondly, because her dress had more flounces, and her bonnet more flowers than any body elses; thirdly, because she occupied the place of honor at the upper end of the pew I The longer he looked the surer he felt that this was the lady I She looked, every inch the heiress, beauty, genius, saint-in her own estimation I She held her form erect, her head thrown back, and her eyes cast down--the very ideal of ,'the pride that apes humility. -- She held in her mauve kid-gloved hand a prayer-book: of green-velvet and gilt, This is she I thought Gerald, as in two seconds he weighed ]er in the balance, and found her marvellously "wanting l In the next pew sat the old lady, Mrs. Horton, in the black silk gown, mantlee, and bonnet that had been her Sunday-dress for the last forty years. By her side was her old. bachelor-brother, Colonel North. And, near the door of the pew, sat a young female plainly dressed) whom   IS       TE  GIs FS Y G S?itO H ME X ay 4-. Gerald Mostyn had' not yet particularly noticed} because     she sat farthest from him, and held her head down, follow- ?    ing the minister from the open hymn-book that lay upon her lap. The minister finished the reading of the hymn, and the organist commenced 'playing the prelude. The congrega- tion arose en masse to sing./ As Gerald Mostyn stood ip, his eyes fell full upon- the young girl at the lower end of Mrs. Horton's pew. And from that moment he saw no one else in the church I Was it merely love at first sight? Was it the. spirit's recognition? What was it? The prophecy of his heart seemed fulfilled I In this plainly-dressed young woman, this maid. or humnble com- panion of Mrs. Horton, he had found hi. ideal; he had recognised the concrete form of his abstract idea. Will you, reader, have a fuller description of her who, at first sight, made so deep an impression upon Gerald Mos- tyn, and who ever afterwards exercised so great an influence, not only upon his destiny, but upon the fate of others?  First, let me warn you that she was not near so pretty' as the three young laies ifn the next pew.  For they were as pretty a/ possible, judged by the wax-doll standard aforesaid.  Th/at is--they were just as pretty as curved. lines, and pink, blue, yellow, and white colors cunningly blended could make them.  And that beauty was as much enhanced by dress, as gauzes, ribbons, laces, and flowers, artfully arranged, could enhance it. About our heroine there was nothing of the sort. No meretricious arts or artifices of the dressing-room dispa- raged the handiwork of her Creator.  There was no de- cided'pink, blue, yellow, or white in her complexion. But there was something infinitely more beautiful,at- tractive, and potent than any mere external combination of brilliant colors could present. The noble mould of her  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7861-00000013"/> "    t THE GIPSY'S PROPHECY. features and expression of her countenance was the outward sign of inward beauty--a majesty of love, wisdom, good- ness, and power,that attracted and absorbed the soul of the spectator. Her form was rather below the medium size, slender, well rounded, and perfectly symmetrical. Her complexion was. pale and clear. Her hair, of the darkest shade of brown, seeming jet black, except when the sunshine brought out its warm, bright hues, was smoothly parted above a forehead -almost too broad and prominent, too majestic with -the power of intellect for womanly beauty, but for the perfect sweetness and meekness of spirit about the expres- sion of the face; the eyebrows were dark, well marked, and slightly arched; her eyes were clear, dark gray, large, full, and seemingly deeply set, but really only overshadowed by the prominent brows, drooping lids, and long, close lashes; her nose was straight and well defined, her chin well rounded, and her lips beautifully curved and gently com- pressed. Some faces that are perfectly charming in front view dis, appoint in profile. This girl's face was attractive in every position, but perhaps most attractive in that half-front, which showed to advantage the majestic forehead, relieved by the sweet outlines of the eyebrows, lips, and chin. I have been thus minute in describing her, because every pe- culiarity of feature was a characteristic of something in her nature; her whole countenance was, as I said, an outward expression of an inward beauty that absorbed the soul of the. beholder. For the rest, she was clothed with classic simplicity; a gray silk dress, and a plain straw bonnet with white strings, were the-external items of her costume. She might be the seamstress of the young ladies, or the humble companion of the. aged matron. Her dress revealed nothing except the good taste of the wearer-; for the wealthiest heiress   :          T HE GI PSYTS PROPH  E   C Y.   45 i:         5 :    could find nothing prettier, nor the poorest governess any- - thing cheaper for her Sunday's wear than this gray silk gown and straw bonnet. Gerald Mostyn made up his own mind : first, that he loved her; secondly, that she was Mrs. Horton's companion; thirdly, that he would seek her ac- quaintance, with the ultimate view, perhaps, of making her his wife.                     : While these feelings, thoughts, and purposes, engaged his mind, I regret to say, that the morning service and sermon had passed off, without his knowing much of what was said or done. Truly he had stood up with the singers, and knelt down with the prayers, sat through the long ser- mon with the listeners, and finally got up and bowed his head to receive the benediction with the others; but all this had been purely mechanical. When service was over, he went out with the- rest, and watched to see what would become of the girl who seemed already to hold his fate in the hollow of her little hand. When the Horton family reached the churchyard, they filed off in pairs, to walk the short distance between Christ Church and Llyndell Manor-house. The two sisters went arm-in-arm, the young belle, whom he took to, be Miss Wynne, walked with Colonel North, and the unknown girl supported the feeble steps of Mrs. Horton. Gerald watched until the party had passed out of sight up the wood-path that led them towards their home. Then he turned to notice that every body had left the church premises except himself and the young clergyman, who seemed waiting to speak to him. "You seem to be a stranger here, sir," said tihe latter, approaching him. "A stranger in my native place, then, sir-; but I have been absent many years, and times and acquaintances have changed. You, I believe, are one of the new comers?" said Gerald.  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7861-00000014"/> 48'    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. 'I am William  Osborne, sir, pastor of Christ Church Parish, at your service." Gerald bowed, replying- "And I, reverend sir, am Gerald AMostyn, late of Radnor, at yours." "I am happy to know you, Mr. Mostyn. And now, sir, without further ceremony, if you have no more agreeable destination, I should be happy to have you return home and dine with me."' Now it had been Gerald's first intention to return to his inn; but the temptation to stay and attend afternoon ser- vice, in the hope of again seeing that noble girl, was strong within him. After a moment's reflection, he frankly accepted the minister's invitation, and accompanied him to the parson- age-a pretty cottage, in a well-cultivated garden, a few rbds off from the church. Here he was presented to Mr. Osbornae^S young wife, a pretty little dark-haired woman, who made him- quite welcome. In the-course of the diinner, it had several times occurred to' Gerald, to speak of the unknown girl, and inquire her name and history; -but ever a deeply respectful regard for- herF kept him silent. At the hour for the afternoon service, he returned with Mr. and Mrs. Osborne to church, He went to the same per he had occupied in the forenoon. The church was by two-thirds not so well filled as in the morning--there are so few people who assist at afternoon service. None of the Horton family were present, and a feeling of deep disappointment was beginning to manifest itself, as he vainly watched the door, and eagerly examined  every new arrival. At-last the desired of his eyes appeared. How his heart rebounded at sight of her. She came gravely up the   TH:E GIPSY'S    PROPR  ECY.     47 aisle, and took her place in the seat she had occupied in tah morning. Not only in the pew in which she sat, but in the whole front line of pews, she was the'only person; yet in her wrapt devotion she seemed unconscious of, or indifferent to, this circumstance. Her manner was more than grave and reverential-it was serious, earnest, fervent, yet without a shade of sanctimoniousness or asceticism. Gerald Mostyn was spell-bound to the contemplation of the soul's beauty irradiating her sweet and noble counte- nance. Now, whether there was any thing in his covert and re- spectful, though fixed regards, to magnetize the subject, I do not know; but suddenly she lifted her eyelids, and met his gaze Hthe sudden glances of those large and brilliant dark-gray eyes thrilled his soul with a deep, strange, pain- ful joy. He colored like a detected trespasser, and, fixed his eyes upon his book. And when, a: few minutes afterwards, he stole a glance at her face, he noticed, with peculiar pleasure, that hier eyes were cast down, and her pale cheekdelicately flushed..  How his heart beat I What a magnetic girl was this, that, the glance of -her eye, the dropping of her eyelashes, the flushing of her chleek, had power to thrill and agitate his whole frame, as by a charge of electricity I In the morning, it' had seemed to him that should this royal-browed girl really be that which she looked, he could wait patiently and toil cheerfully long years, in the certain prospect of possessing her at last. But this afternoon, when -her presence shook him like a storm, he felt that to wait for her he must fly her neigh- borhood. And instead of attending to the services, he began to calculate--should she prove what he supposed her-how soon he .might, properly, get presented to her, cultivate  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7861-00000015"/> 48"    THRE  GIPSY'S- PROPHECY. her acquaintance, woo her affections, propose for her hand, and make her his wife! Yes I how soon he might, with- out madness, gallop over these succeeding steps to the goal of his happiness. He concluded that, under favorable auspices, he could effect all this in one month 1 Then came up another subject of calculation-how long would it take him to graduate? when might he get admit- ted to the bar? how soon should he be able to get into a living practice? He decided that, with double diligence, all might be ac- complished in two years! But in the meantime, after paying his expenses, how far would the residue of his two thousand pounds go towards supporting'a wife?  That she was as poor, and poorer than himself, and still less accustomed to luxuries of the table and extravagances of the toilet, he felt convinced of, and rejoiced at. He therefore concluded that the remnant of his two- thousand pounds, college fees subtracted, would go very far indeed towards supporting such an humble establish- ment as would content himself and his chosen wife, until he should get into practice, and begin to reap the golden harvest of fame and riches of which he dreamed. His course was now clear-to get, as soon as possible, an introduction to this noble-browed girl. If he should find her what he expected, the rest would follow. He had refrained, in the forenoon, from inquiring her name; but after this evening there would be no opportunity, for a whole week, of ascertaining it. To wait seven more days for that knowledge was impossible. He resolved that after service he would make an opportunity of seeking the desired information from Mr. Osborne. So through tJhe afternoon service, between his stolen glances at the unknown  girl, he thought, planned, and X,   Id         THE   GIPSY^S PROPHECY.      490 dreamed, while the minister of God preached a sermon suited to his needs, had he listened to it, from thetext- * "Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you." When the services were over, and the congregation dis- persed, Gerald Mostyn found that the desired of his eyes and heart had disappeared among the crowd. In vain he sought her everywhere; 'she had vanished I And while he was still seeking her, the people were scattering and hur- rying away to their several homes, to escape the storm that was seen to be gathering in the west. And before he had thought to follow their example, his shoulder was touched by a friendly hand, and, turning round, he saw Mr. Osborne by his side. "You cannot possibly get home before the storm bursts; it is beginning to rain already, and hark to that thunder I You will have to come under my umbrella and walk home with me, to take refuge at the parsonage," said the minis-- ter. Gerald Mostyn bowed and looked up at the sky. From north to south, all along the western horizon, extended a great black cloud, with lurid, copper-colored edges, like smoke and fire. , Muttering thunder and large single drops of rain, warned him that the storm was about to burst. "I think, sir, I shall be compelled to accept your oblig. ing offer," replied Gerald, smiling. "Come on, then, sir I There is no time to lose in com-. pliments," answered the minister, hoisting his large, tent- like umbrella; and offering his arm to his invited guest. With a bow of thanks Gerald came under the shelter, and they took their way towards the parsonage. Now, then, was an opportunity of learning the name and circumstances of the unknown girl.

The minister, who had followed Gerald's example in attention to his toilet, and who was now quite ready, opened the docr, and-attended his guest back to the parlor. " As they entered the room, Mrs. Osborne sprung up, and hastened to meet and welcome her unexpected guest. But even while she was shaking hands with him, and he was politely expressing the pleasure he felt in, being thus forced to take up his quarters at the parsonage .for :the evening, he caught glimpse of another figure seated by the window, the sight of whom made his heart bound, and his brain reel.

"Fortune? She is a heathen goddess. I do not fall down and worship her," answered Constance with sweet dignity. Some foreheads look like thrones I Hers looked such an one now I Gerald bowed in deference to her remark. He could as yet scarcely trust himself to speak again. A host of bewildering impressions crowded upon him. Here before him was the ideal of his soul-the desired of his heart-the delight of his eyes I alas, no equal of his -own in adverse fortune I No daughter of the people was she, whom he could ask to toil, struggling beside him, up life's steep and rugged ascent; butlthe great, moneyed celebrity of the county-the great, landed heiress, to whose lofty alliance only men of the highest rank, fortune, and distinction, might dare to aspire. And for him, a poor student, to pretend to the hand of Miss Wynne, would seem presumptuous, mercenary, mad I Memory was busy, also, traveling backward through the past to pause upon the one bright morn when, at a May- day festival, he had danced with Constance. - She was then a child of six years of age, he a boy of twelve. .Yet she had remembered him, while he had totally forgotten her- but that was natural, for doubtless he had changed less in features than she had. M    Not long lingered his mind on the past; it came wearily -back to the painful present, to dwell amid the fragments of his shattered dream.

Hence all that remained for him to do--his duty-was to battle with and conquer the infatuation that had taken possession of him. This storm of thought, feeling, and resolution, hurried through his mind in the few moments that he stood listen- ing and replying to the heiress. And before it became absolutely necessary for him to force himself to speak again, they were joined by Mr. and Mrs. Osborne and Francis Heath, the brother of the latter, a dark-haired and dark-eyed young man, with a highly intellectual and somewhat melancholy expression of coun- tenance, and grave and thoughtful manners and conversa- tion ;-every one said-one even more adapted than his brother to the discharge of a clergyman's duties. Mr. Osborne brought him up to the group; and after both gentlemen had paid their respects to Miss Wynne, the former presented the latter to his guest-in the follow- ing style- "Mr. Mostyn, allow me to introduce to your favorable notice my brother-in-law, a young student of medicine, under Dr. James Horne. Gerald arose, bowed, and sat down again, in augmented bitterness of spirit. He had recognized in Mr. Heath the young gentleman, who, at the village inn, had spoken with so much enthusiasm of Miss Wynne. He saw him take a seat on her other side, and at once, with the air of an old friend, enter into conversation with her. And the pangs of jealousy were added to those of desponding love. To make matters worse, Mr. Osborne drew him into dis- course, so that he could no longer have the tantalizing pleasure of listening to her voice in t6te-a-tdte with his' supposed rival Did his countenance betray his feelings, and did she perceive it? 3  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7861-00000018"/> i4    THE  GIPSYS PROPHECY. He was almost tempted to believe so, for through his covert glances he noticed that her eyes were turned towards him - and at last, in meeting her eyes, she slightly flushed; and soon after, with a bow and a smile, she terminated her Ifte.-Sfte, and moving around, addressed a remark to Mr. Osborne, which opened a discussion, through which the conversation became general. It was now that the light of her glorious soul beamed forth. The subject under debate was the indisputable prevalence of social evil, and the inefficiency of legal statutes to pre- vent crime. The prison systems, with their doubtful ten- dencies, were considered. Capital punishment, and the recently-started question of its abolishment, was discussed, Mr. and Mrs. Osborne took the cautious, conservative view. Miss Wynne assumed a more enlightened, liberal, and humaneo position. Mr. Osborne said, low, uneducated, unregenerate men were like animals, whose selfishness, brutality and violence, would only be governed by fear; that fear of imprison- ment was the best safeguard to property; fear of the gallows, the best protective of life; fear of consequences generally, the best preventive of crime. Gerald Mostyn listened to the minister's words, but looked the while upon Miss Wynne's face--that grew upon bis vision as the face of a young archangel; under her broad, nmajestic brow, her large eyes, fixed intently on the speaker, glowed like two luminous stars; a soft flush red- dened her cheeks; her lips, as if touched with heavenly fire, glowed and quivered with the utterance that would not be repressed. And as -soon as the minister ceased, she replied. Constance said that- punishment was retaliation; retalia. tion was vengeance i and vengeance, the offspring of hate   TH]E  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.

Constance spoke warmly, earnestly, enthusiastically, light streaming from her eyes, and color burning on her cheeks, as the words glowed upon her lips. Gerald watched her, wondering no longer that people called her most beautiful, for her strongly characteristic countenance was the medium of a high, spiritual beauty, of which the most classic regularity of feature could not have been susceptible. For how could the pretty little receding forehead of "the world-renowned statue," the Medicean Venus, compare with her royal breadth of brow? Or the far-famed black eyes of the Andalusian girls, with their simple repertoire of the flashing and melting, com- pare with her clear, brilliant gray eyes, with their sudden brightenings and varying shades, that truly render every shade of thought or feeling? Or how could the settled bloom of any perfect wax-doll complexion vie with the delicate pallor of her cheek with its sudden flashesbOf electric, fire? 'These were the lover's questions, and not mine--the lover's questions, as his- eyes, -and heart, and soul, hung entranced upon her countenance.

"You must all receive Miss Wynne's views, especially upon the subject of capital punishment, with a degree of allowance. Miss Wynne has a very vital interest in having the death penalty abolished," he said, turning lightly to that young lady. But to the astonishment of Gerald, Constance turned deadly pale, compressed her lips, and clenched her hands, as if compelling down some rising and almost overwhelm- ing emotion. Gerald, guessing that the minister had somehow made an unlucky speech, hastened to do away its effects by laughingly saying- "I take an especial personal interest in having capital. punishment abolished--Miss Wynne, do you believe in astrology?"  Constance started, fixed her eyes intently upon the questioner, and then withdrawing them, answered- "I do not know. 'There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy.' If we are to place confidence in history, there are many recorded testimonies to the truth of astrology. And I do not re- ject a science or a theory because I do not understand it." "When you hear Miss Wynne talk in that style, I would simply remind you that the great Doctor Johnson believed in ghosts l'" said Mr. Osborne. Without heeding this remark, Miss Wynne turned to Gerald, and said-- "Sir, why did you ask me if I believed in astrology?" "Because, Miss Wynne, I was about to relate for your amusement a prediction that was made concerning myself by a professor of that black art." "A prediction!" exclaimed Mrs. Osborne, drawing near, with eager interest.   [;I!I        THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        5' "Yes, madame," replied Gerald, smiling, "a prediction which, if I believed, would certainly not dispose me to favor the abolishment of the death penalty." Constance was listening, her chin resting upon her hand, her eyes fixed upon his face, in earnest attention. "Miss Wynne, you do not probably recollect the Egyp- tian Dervis, Achbad, who some years ago, attended by an interpreter, travelled through the country, casting horo- scopes, exposing the past, revealing the present, and pre- dicting the future?" "Oh, yes I I doI'" exclaimed Constance, in a low and thrilling tone, that caused Gerald to look from her to her friends in surprise and inquiry. "But go on with your story, Mr. Mostyn," she continued, without relaxing her fixed and almost painful attention. CHAPTER IV. Listen, gentle lady, now, Awful hands have marked my brow. "i MY story," replied Gerald Mostyn, "is short, but very singular. Three years since, while I was sojourning for a short time in the town of Brighton, before going to the university, I chanced to hear of the Egyptian Dervis, Achbad, who was at that time creating quite a sensation there. His wonderful reputation was the theme of everv tongue. "Idleness and  curiosity combined to lead me to his rooms, which were situated in the fourth story of an ob- scure lodging-house in a back street, and where:Ifound a leather-colored old gcltlcman, in a  vol-umnils white   &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7861-00000020"/> 68 '   T THE GIPSY'S  PROPHECY. turban, and an ample, flowing black robe, bound around his waist with a white scarf, and bordered around the sweeping skirts with the signs of the zodiac in white. This was the Egyptian astrologer." "Some clever Yankee actor," suggested Mr. Osborne. "No, sir he had the unmistakable Egyptian features. Impostor he might have been I Yankee or European he was not 1" "Well, sir I well I the astrologer?" inquired Constance, who was eagerly listening. "Well, Miss Wynne, this old man, this soi-disant astrologer, I found with appropriate surroundings - skulls, cross-bones, and skeletons; serpents, toads, and lizards; stills, crucibles, and cauldrons occupied the floor. Maps of unknown countries, probably Hades, and charts of un- known figures-probably diabolical-adorned the walls. At the upper end of the room was a large circle of wood painted black and set up perpendicularly against the wall, like a huge, round blackboard, and covered with mystic figures drawn in white. Opposite this, at the other ex- tremity of the room, was a large mystic mirror. "The only personal attendant of the old astrologer was the French interpreter. "I made known my business, 'whereupon he put me through many preliminary degrees, too tedious to mention, and then began to unroll my whole life. "He told me first of the past, of the loss of my mother, my father, and then of my home. "I thought that he was deceiving me, that he saw ' alone' written legibly upon my brow, .anid only read it aloud. So I told him- that Hhad not come thither to inquire of the past, which was well known to me, but to hear of the future, of which I was ignorant. "Whereupon he required a night to cast my horoscope.

The next day I went  " "Well?" questioned Constance, earnestly. "My horoscope was a horrorscope indeed! It predicted for me a short and stormy life, and a sharp and sudden death!" "Good heaven I But-the details?" "It prophesied four remarkable events, the first of which has already come to pass." "And that was?" "The loss of my patrimonial estate 1" "Singular coincidence 1" interrupted Mr. Osborne, as he arose and joined his wife and brother-in-law at the other' end of the room. "I thought so when the prophecy was fulfilled," replied Gerald. "And the other three events?" softly inquired Con- stance. "The other three events, if they follow as predicted, must happen within the next two years, or before I reach my twenty-sixth anniversary. The first of these is to be the unexpected inheritance of vast wealth." Upon hearing this, a bright. smile played around the lips of Constance, and banished the clouds from her brow. She waited a few minutes for him to proceed, but finding that he continued silent, she said-- "Well, Mr. Mostyn, go on! what was the third predicted event?" "Do you command me to inform you?" "No, sir; I beg you, of your courtesy, to do so." "Very well," he said, dropping his voice to a low under. tone. "It was to be my marriage with the woman I should love " A deep vivid blush supplanted the bright .smile that quivered over Constance's variable face. There was a  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7861-00000021"/> D0    THE 'GIPSY7S PROPHECY. pause, broken at length' by her voice, as she gently in- quired- "And the fourth?" The answer came reluctantly, and in tones so low as to meet only her ear- '"The fourth and last prediction was, that before my twenty-sixth birthday I shoitld die a violent death." A low cry broke from the lips of Constance, as her hands flew up and covered her face. After a minute or two she dropped them, and looking him steadily in the face, said, with quiet firmness-- "You doubtless wonder at my emotion. Now, hear me. On the autumn following the summer in which that predic- tion was made to you, I was in York, with my grand- mother, and with Mrs. Osborne, who was then Miss Heath. Curiosity took us to the rooms of the Egyptian, who was then practising in that city. And after some such prepara- tions as he had used in your case, he cast my horoscope, and read my future. It was this-that before my twentieth birthday, I should be a bride, but never a wife, for that the fatal form of the scaffold arose -between the nuptial bene- diction and the husband's hearth. Such were the words of the prophecy Ha similar prediction was made by an old gipsy at the Derby only this spring." She spoke with a solemnity that seemed to overshadow every other feeling. There was a pause, interrupted at length by Gerald Mostyn, who, in a tone so grave that it partook of rqbuke, inquired.-  "But assuredly a woman of Miss Wynne's intellectual power, and, above all, of her Christian faith, can never for an instant give serious credence to such absurd pagan mummeries." Iihmediately after making  this presumptuous speech, Gerald felt conscious that he might have given offence,   X'q', ,:    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        61. and he turned with anxiety to note its effect upon Miss Wynne. But Constance had no morbid self-love to be so easily affronted. Her brilliant eyes were fixed upon him with an expression of confidence, respect, and gratitude, as she bowed her head and replied-- "You think this a weakness, and I thank you for letting me know that you do - " "Miss Wynne, I do beseech you, pardon me!" 'Pardon? .I said I thanked you, and I really do; pray always speak to me with the same frankness. To return to our first subject. I know not really what quantity or quality of belief I accord to this prophecy. Phrenolo- gists give me large idealty, sublimity, marvellousness, and veneration-these go to form a very grand reverence for the spiritual and supernatural " "But your reason, Miss Wynne, should arm    you against such superstition-pardon me I Again I am pre- suming."  "No, you are not. And my reason does not arm me with incredulity; reason only assures me that I should not reject a science because I cannot comprehend it. And my reading teaches me that the Druses claim to be the last depositaries of the lost art of foretelling the future, and that the frequent fulfillment of their predictions are on record. As regards myself, Mr. Mostyn, I confess to you, that despite of faith and reason, this dark prophecy some- times overshadows my spirit." "I wonder at that." "Aye-in my most devotional hours, and in my gayest moments, the memory of this prediction, like the- black wing of a fiend, suddenly swoops down upon me, changing all my brightness and gravity into gloom and horror!" "The vagrants! They should not be suffered to wander &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7861-00000022"/> up and down the country, scattering their seeds of misery, and.., " "'Takiing captive the ears of foolish women, you would say.)' "Nay-I would say nothing so arrogant." "Well," said Miss Wynne, with a solicitude to set her- self right in his opinion, which was 'excessive sweet' flattery to the heart of her companion, " this must I say in self-defence-that, had the prediction of which I speak in- volved only my own life-had it been foretold that Con- stance Wynne must die thus prematurely and ignominously, I could, believe me, look bravely in the face of fate, nor l shudder to meet it when it comes I That is natural I The most selfish among us can suffer with more fortitude than we could sin, and die with more courage than we could kill another.  But that this early and shameful death should have been foretold of me  as a consequence of " She paused, shuddering, and then exclaimed--"But this is very culpable weakness! Surely it must be the gathering-in of this gloomy evening that so oppresses my spirits-it can be nothing else. God reigns I and I appeal from the astrolo. ger's prediction to His omnipotent protection!" Then shaking off the shadow from her brow, and speak- ing with bright cheerfulness, she called out- "Mr. Osborne, how goes the night? Will there be a probability of my returning home this evening?, The minister, who, with his wife and brother-in-law, formed a   little self-constituted committee upon Sunday. schools, now spoke up in reply- "Miss Wynne, harken to that rain!

"Mr. Mostynl I presume you heard the observation I addressed to Miss Wynne, and which is equally applicable to yourself, and also to my brother Frank here. Likewise, I suppose you are sufficiently well acquainted with these mountains to know that it will be impossible for you to ascend to-night, or even to-morrow.: Finally, -I suppose that no urgent-business calls you to Bleakton. Moreover, listen to that rain 1" said the minister, triumphantly. The rain was indeed increasing, and beating with great violence against the house. There was no gainsaying it. Still, however, Gerald hesitated- until his host leaned for- ward and whispered him, with an arch look- "Do as you like, else I'll make you!" With a sigh that was certainly not one 6f regret, Mr. Mostyn yielded the point, thanked his friend, and consented to, remain, as he secretly wished to do, the guest of the house that sheltered Constance Wynne, Lights were then brought in, and Mrs. Osborne went out to give orders for tea, which was soon served After tea, when the company were re-assembled in the parlor, Mr. Osborne said- "Come, Miss Wynne, we cannot let the opportunity of your presence this evening pass unimproved. The storm has lulled. I know you will favor us with one of. Haydn's or Beethoven's grand anthems!" and rising, he took- the hand of Constance, and led her to the organ, that, instead of a piano, graced the minister's parlor.

Without stooping to any of the insincere apologies in vogue with young ladies upon such occasions, Miss Wynne seated herself before the organ, and, amidst a profound silence, commenced a slow and solemn prelude, and then with her voice struck into the sublime strains of- "I know that my Redeemer liveth." Not a whisper was uttered, scarcely a breath was drawn, as that awful melody arose and swelled upon the air. The voice of the musician was a rich double contralto of surpassing depth and power. She sang with a perfect self- surrender, pouring her whole soul in song. Her head was raised, her dark hair swept back from her wide forehead, her clear eyes lifted; and as the anthem ascended, how gloriously with heavenly inspiration shone that broad, white forehead, how splendid with dazzling light those clear, gray eyes I For the whole length of the piece she held her audience spell-bound in a celestial trance. At its long-drawn close, while yet her fingers lingered on the keys, and her eyes soared aloft, the death silence that continued was the truest and most fitting tribute to the effect -of her performance. She was the first to recover from the spell that she had both created and   shared. Quickly rising, she left the instrument, and crossed the room to her own seat upon the sofa. "That was magnificent!" exclaimed Mr. Heath, break- ing the charm. "I doubt if the great work of the great master was ever better rendered." "Yes, her performance of sacred anthems is admirable. And what is more, her skill is altogether the triumph of mind over matter; her voice is a made one, the effect of cultivation, not the gift of nature." "What those magnificent tones that filled all the air,   I        'P EtE U GIPSYTS PROPHECY. *&amp; that filled our hearts like a charge ot electricity, those rich, deep, thrilling, thunderous tones " "Were Constance's own creation. Her natural voice was a falsetto. But her soul was full of music as a storm- cloud of electricity, and with years of persevering toil and study she prepared its fitting utterance. You see the result.  While these two gentlemen talked apart, Gerald Mostyn approached, and seated himself near Constance Wynne. He had no word at all of commonplace compliment-to pay her. Her music was above all praise-to have offered such a tribute would have been impertinent. But he might at least return thanks. "In common with your friends, I am much indebted to you for a profound enjoyment, Miss Wynne," he said.- "I am very happy in having pleased you, sir. You prefer sacred music, I imagine?" "I do, much above every other sort." "And so do I. I think the highest powers in music can only be drawn out in the praise of God; it is as though they had been religiously reserved for that service  Gerald bowed profoundly. "It must be so," he said, "though this thought had not occurred to me." Thus again they were launched into a tItee-a-tte, which lasted until the social circle broke up ifor the night. Then, with a good-night" that fell like a benediction, Ccnstance withdrew, under the charge of Mrs. Osborne. "Francis, you know where to find your bed," said the clergyman, putting a night-lamp into the hands of his brother-in-law, who received it, and with a grave bow, left the parlor. "And now, Sir Knight of the Awful Brow, I am at your command," smiled -Mr. Osborne, taking up the remaining taper to atterd his last guest.  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7861-00000024"/> . -    L, V.

And so saying, the light-hearted host withdrew, and left his guest alone. "Not dream of Constance Wynne."   Would he ever dream of any thing else by night? Would he ever think 'of any thing else by day? He had scarcely known her twelve hours, yet in that time, from every look, and tone, and gesture of hers, he had quaffed deep draughts of love, that seemed to have changed his whole personality and destiny. "Not dream   of Constance Wynne," indeed Why, henceforth she possessed him like an inspiring spirit, beat within his pulses, burned within his heart, thought within his brain-in a  word, lived within his soul. He might never look upon her outward face again, after the next morning; but henceforth and for ever, he felt that his soul was wedded to hers. For some time sleep was impossible; for though he closed his eyes,' he still saw Constance Wynne, with .her ample, white forehead, her dark hair swept back from the wide temples, and her clear, luminous, most expressive eyes, now soaring to the heavens in an upward flight, now dropped upon his face in an earnest, quiet, penetrating study, now looking for some wondrous truth or beauty in the distant horizon of human knowledge. Long after all   T-HE  GIPSY   S, PROPRECGY      67 the rest of the household were asleep, Gerald Mostyn lay awake, haunted by the image of Constance Wynne. It was consequently late in the morning when he awoke, Aware of the early hours kept at country-houses, he arose, and rung his bell. It was answered by the little servant boy, Fred, who brought him his well-cleaned boots, and supplied him with fresh water. He made a hasty but careful toilet. And then he left the room and went into the parlor, where he found Mr. and Mrs. Osborne, and Mr. Heath, awaiting him.       e He greeted the circle, and looked anxiously around for another desirked presence. But Constance Wynne was nowhere visible.

And consequently, on receiving. Mr. Osborne's message that Miss Wynne was detained at his house by the storm, she had summoned her coachman, and given him orders to have the carriage in readiness by sunrise the next morning, to drive over to the parsonage and bring his young mistress home. The man had scrupulously followed her directions.  THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        69 -Constance had obeyed the call, and reached Llyndell in time for the, family breakfast. After kissing the fingers of the old lady, shaking hands with Colonel North, embracing her cousins, and answering everybody's questions, Constance seated-herself at the table, and said- "My dear grandmother, there is the son of an old friend of yours in the neighborhood." "Ah; Constance, who is he?" "( Mr. Gerald Ross Mostyn, madam. He has come down to spend the two months' vacation at Crucis." "Aye, my dear. Where is he staying?" "At the tavern at Bleakton." "Indeed!

"Robbed him?  Surely, my dear, you use strong language 1-" said the old lady, rebukingly. "Truly I1 It was a judicial robbery-not an indictable one," said Constance, in calm scorn.

Will you do me the favor to call on Mr. Mostyn, and invite him to make our house his home for the period of his sojourn in the neighborhood?" "Certainly, my dear sister, with great pleasure," replied the colonel, looking up from his plate, and bowing his head.       - "And mind, my dear brother, let your invitation be most cordial and pressing; as though his coming to us would be a great personal favor to ourselves; for these young men of good birth and ill fortune, are full of fastidi- ous scruples which do them honor, but which must not be allowed to do them injury. You see, my dears," continued the old lady, turning toward her grand-daughters, "the poor young gentleman might feel obliged to decline the first or second invitation, particularly if it were not cordially given, upon the ground of his not being able in any way to reciprocate. So you will be very pressing, Colonel North." "I will bring him to the house, madam," replied the colonel, smiling at his sister's earnestness. Constance gave him a grateful look. Did she recipro- cate Gerald Mostyn's sudden predilection? We shall see. Immediately after breakfast, Colonel North, attended by a servant with a led horse, set out to ride to Bleakton. The same forenoon, Gerald Mostyn, in his little room at* the inn of Bleakton, sat studying at his reading-table. The volume open before him was "Coke upon Lyttleton."

With a wave off the hand the colonel repudiated this sentiment, and said- "Your father and myself were once dear friends, young sir; our friendship was only interrupted by his death I but you scarcely recollect this?" i "I certainly remember seeing you at our house, sir, as well as my father's frequent visits to yours." "Very well, then; now we shall understand each other I My niece, Miss Wynne, tells me that you are down here for a stay of two months. Now your father's son should make no other house his home save that which shelters me. In one word, I bear the compliments of Mrs. Horton, to- gether with her earnest solicitations joined to my own, that you will do us the honor to take up your abode with us for the term of your stay in the neighborhood.": "Really, sir, Mrs. Horton-and yourself--are exces- sively kind, and I earnestly thank you." "You will come, then?" "Sir, permit me to express my deep sense of your goodness, even while I beg leave to decline your invita- tion." "Aye, but ' leave to decline' will not be granted you, my young friend. The thing is quite impossible. My word is passed to the ladies to bring you back with me," re- joined the colonel. His " word passed to the ladies"-perhaps to Constance. Had she, really, aught to do with this invitation? Why   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        73 not? It was she who had told her uncle of his intended sojourn in the neighborhood. And oh I if Constance willed that he should go, her will was law I In this case the very suspicion of her will was--destiny! He would conquer his repugnance to receiving hospitality from the wealthy; he would go, if only for a few days. "Well," he said, frankly holding out his hand to th6e colonel, "ladies' commands have as much authority as a bench warrant. I will give you no trouble in executing them.' I am very heartily at your and the ladies' disposal. And in all candor I am compelled to say that never was a poor gentleman arrested with more pleasure." "That is honest, at all events. Well, you will find us no harsh wardens. How soon will you be ready to set out? Remember, I came on purpose to fetch you, and my servant brought a horse for your accomodation." "I can be ready in an hour, sir," replied Mr. Mostyn, after a moment's thought, and resuming the natural gravity of his manner. "Good. I have some business to do here that will occupy me for about that length of time, at the end of which I will call for you!" said the colonel, rising and taking a short leave.        . And in one hour more the colonel, with his invited guest, set out for Llyndell.  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7861-00000028"/> CHAPTER VI.

"EVANS, come" hither," said Mrs. Horton, addressing the matronly woman, who within the last few years, had been her mistresses confidential agent in all domestic affairs. Evans left the china closet where she had been putting away the' breakfast service, and came to the side of her lady, who was seated in her high-backed chair, near the door of the adjoining bed-chamber, and as usual, engaged in crochet. "Evans, attend to me. I expect company to-day-Mr. Ross Mostyn, a gentleman of family, and once also of fortune. You will prepare the back, room, left hand, second floor, for his accommodation. Put np the fringed white dimity curtains to the windows, and the white and scarlet-tulip quilt on the bed. Then go to the store-house and select a second-best ham, and second-best round of spiced beef; from the pantry take a pair of medium pullets; get up the home-made wine from the cellars; from the garden and orchards the second-best vegetables and fruits for dinner; and when yoi come to lay the cloth, put on the plain gilt-edged china service.

Therefore, finish arranging that closet as quickly as you can, and go, and attend to my orders," said the old lady, who, notwithstanding her "graduated scale," could not bear to be thought a respecter of persons. Evans finished her work and went out to obey. But she had scarcely closed the door behind her, when a violent barking of the dogs announced that a visitor or visitors had arrived. Is it the colonel with our guests?" said the old lady to herself. But in a few moments Evans re-entered with a face full of interest, and even of excitement. "Well, Evans, who is it?" "Oh, madam, a rale nob.'" ' Evans, how many times have I ordered you not to use such terms in my presence? Pray, what do you mean by a nob?"  "I beg your pardon, madam-it is a rale responsible, respectable, portly-looking gentleman." "Who is he, then?" "Indeed, madam, I don't know;- but he come in a carriage, with a young gentleman and a servant. Oh  here comes David now with a card," said the woman, as the waiter entered, bowed, and put the pasteboard into the hands of his mistress. The old lady arranged her spectacles, and read-- "' Lord Starr I' Lord Starr I The new  minister l Dear me I David?" "Madam!"

"Evans, come with me into my chamber, and help me to arrange'my toilet," was the next command given, as the old lady arose with dignity and passed into her bed- chamber, which joined this, the family breakfast-room. And while Evans assisted her to exchange her black silk dress for one of black velvet, and her plain book-muslin  i cap and neckerchief for finer ones of lace, Mrs. Horton said- "And oh, Evans, Lord Starr will certainly stay to dinner, and remain over night.

Now, do you per- fectly comprehend me, so that you need not commit the barbarism of sending for me from the drawing-room?") "Certainly, madam; I  am now to prepare for the very best company," replied the woman, in sly glee. "Evans, how often have I signified to you that I am no respecter of persons?" inquired her mistress, in some dis- pleasure.            , "I never presumed for to say you were, madam." "No I  for that would be unchristian; nevertheless, Evans, even the Scriptures exhort us to pay' honor to whom honor is due.'"    ' "Yes, madam."

Call David to go before me and open -the doors." But as Evans went out to obey this order, Constance Wynne entered. Constance looked, as ever, stately, graceful, and distin- guished, with her dark tresses swept back in shining masses from her fair, broad brow, and her perfect form attired in a fresh white muslin dress with a close-fitting boddice, flowing sleeves, and a skirt that fell in voluminous folds from her rounded waist to her feet. Not a single item of ornament drew off attention from her noble person. "Oh, Constance, my dear, I am glad you looked in. I was wishing to speak to you. Do you know who is below?' "Yes, madam, Lord Starr and his son, Captain Starr." "Ayel and now I have a word to say to you, my dear I Lord Starr is a nobleman of immense fortune, occupying a high social position, even independent of his present ex- alted official rank." "Yes, madam."  "He  is a widower, but fifty-two years of age, very handsome, very accomplished, and very fascinating in his address."  "Well, my dear grandmother, what then?" "Child, don't you see? Why your dress is too plain, Constance. Go, I beg of you, and exchange it for your embroidered India muslin and your set of pearls; for reflect, I beseech you, Constance, that there,is not only Lord Starr, a widower of fifty-two, but his son, a young gentleman of twenty-five-both eligible-most eligible matches."  "Grandmother!" said Constance, in a tone almost of reproach.  "Will you do this, Constance?"  "Dear madam, pardon me, I cannot; but my cousins are beautifully dressed, they will save the credit of the  : family."                               &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7861-00000030"/> ;'8   .THSE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. "Umiph- well I am thankful, at all events, that the Misses Horton understand what is fitting," said the old lady, in momentary displeasure. Then quickly recovering her temper, and unwilling to offend her most esteemed grand-daughter, she hastened to say- "Do not mistake me; I wish you to have every aid of dress that your ample fortune can justify, though you look very well as you are, my dear; a noble lady, whatever you wear. Ah I here comes David to attend me. Well I my child I come in when you feel disposed." And so saying, the old lady smoothed the folds of her dress, and crossed the hall to enter the drawing-room. Constance Wynne, for the present, delayed presenting herself. But the three Misses Horton, like three gayly-plumaged birds of paradise, flew down the stairs and fluttered into the drawing-room. "Will he come? will he come?" mused Constance, as she passed through Mrs. Horton's chamber into thd break- fast-room, and thence on into the little front sitting-room, and taking up a book, placed herself at the window-seat, to read, and to watch the bridle-path leading down the mountain side from Bleakton. Soon three horsemen rambled over the brow of the ridge and came into sight. 'She guessed before she recognized their identity, and arose to smooth her dark tresses and straighten the folds of her dress. For Constance Wynne  was too thoroughly a woman to be indifferent to her per- sonal appearance. Her Spartan simplicity of, dress was only a higher refinement of taste. Meanwhile the three horsemen reached the lawn. Colonel North leaped from his horse, threw his bridle to his servant, and welcomed Mr. Mostyn, who had also alighted, to Llyndell. :Both gentlemen then entered the house.   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY.       '79 David, who was on duty as porter, bowed and informed his master that a room had been prepared for the expected visitor. "Very well, then I show Mr. Mostyn thither, and attend his orders. Meanwhile, sir," said the colonel, turning and addressing his guest, "I will go to my room to brush up a little, and a quarter of an hour hence will await you." ',Au revoir, then," replied Mr. Mostyn, following his attendant up the stairs and down the long passage until they reached "the back room, left hand-" that had been prepared for him. And after a few trifling attentions to his toilet, Gerald Mostyn announced himself ready, and went below, where, in the hall, he foundsColonel North awaiting him. "I hear that we have visitors since I left this morning. Lord Starr, the new minister, and his son, Captain Starr, of the Horse Guards. Come 1 shall we go in?" said the colonel, as smilingly he met his guest. Mr. Mostyn, returning the smile, nodded assent, and both passed into the drawing-room. As Gerald crossed the threshold, the change from the broad sunshine into the subdued light of the sumptuous drawing-room showed him a number of persons present, but not their individual identities. Colonel North, after a circular bow directed to the whole company, led his guest up to the end of the room, where, in a high-backed chair, sat a tall and stately old lady, in a black velvet dress, and a very elegant lace cap. "Mrs. Horton, permit me to present my young friend, Mr. Ross Mostyn. Mr. Mostyn, Mrs.; Horton," he said. Gerald bowed deeply. Without rising, the old lady extended her hand, saying, cordially- "I am glad to see you, Mr. Mostyn I Your father and !  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7861-00000031"/> Q8    THE' GIPSYS PROPHECY. mother were dear friends of mine;; and it makes me very happy to renew my acquaintance with their son." "Madam, my parents could not have left me a better legacy than your kind regards," replied Gerald, gallantly. "Thank, you; there, .that will do, my young friend; do not stop to: waste courtly speeches on an old gentlewoman. Colonel North, take him to the young ladies." "You made a hit with that last fine speech of yours, my dear fellow," thought the colonel, as he conducted the visitor to a side sofa, where "The Three Graces," as the Misses Horton were called, reclined. Pausing before the first "Grace"--a wax-doll, dressed in pink barege-he said- "Miss Horton, I take pleasure in presenting to you Mr. Mostyn. Mr. Gerald Mostyn, Miss May Horton." A gracious smile'and bend of the head from the lady- a profound bow from the gentleman, and the colonel passed on to the next "'Grace"-a second wax-doll in white- whom he introduced as Miss Lily Horton; and, finally, to the last "Grace"-a third wax-doll in pale lilac-whom he named ,as Miss Violet Horton. And then this master of ceremonies presented his guest to Lord Starr, whom he found to be a well-preserved, handsome, and dignified man of fifty; and, lastly, to his son, Captain Starr, a military eltgante of the first water. These formal introductions over, the colonel conducted Mr. Mostyn to a seat on the sofa, beside Miss Violet, who, though excessively like the other two dolls, had a little more life and variety in her manners, Violet was called, either Viola or Lettie, as the taste or caprice of her friends dictated-even as Constance Wynne was sometimes called Constantia, and other times Winnie. But where, then, was Constance? g It was with a feeling of the deepest disappointment land misgiving that Gerald Mostyn looked around and missed her.   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.'        81 Happily he had scarcely time to speculate upon the cause of her absence, when the door opened softly, and Constance entered. She advanced with graceful dignity-her head gently thrown back, her eyelids cast down, her dark hair swept off in shining waves from her fair, wide forehead, and her snow-white dress falling in classic folds around her perfect form. She greeted the visitors with stately grace. Gerald's heart bounded to see her. He could not help it-it was magnetism--he sprang to meet her, led her to a seat, and took his place beside'her. The very openness of this act blended suspicion to the deep love that was con- suming his heart. But the company was too small to permit any two to indulge in tete-a-tete. The conversation, per force, became general-with one transient exception-Mrs. Horton, catching her brother's eye, signed for him to approach her; and when the colonel found himself by his sister's side, she said-  "I want a few friends here this evening to meet Lord Starr. Now, is there any thing so serious between our guest, Mr. Ross Mostyn, and his relatives, the Hornes, as to make it improper for me to invite them during his stay?" "By no means I for though he does not choose to take up his residence among them, yet, by what I understand t from himself, they are on polite, if not affectionate terms.' "Very good I I will slip out and write my notes, as there is no time to be lost," said Mrs. Horton, as she quietly withdrew from the room. Among the company left behind, arose the vexed ques- tion of social philosophy, especially that portion of the subject which related to the prevention and cure of evil. The burden of the argument rested upon Lord Starr, r Colonel North, and Mr. Mostyn--each of the three beauties and the young lieutenant occasionally flashing into the con- versation with witticisms apropos,to nothing.  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7861-00000032"/> 82    THE  GIPSYNS PROPHECY. Lord Starr and Colonel North took the conservative side of the question; Mr. Mostyn, single-handed, sustained the liberal. The two elder polemics supported scaffolds, prisons, pillories, and scourges, as reformatary agents The younger one favored moral suasion. Constance said little, but her fine eyes were often turned to Gerald in eager expectation, earnest sympathy, or eloquent approval. And he imbibed deep draughts of inspiration from her presence. The argument was interrupted by the re-appearance of Mrs. Horton; and soon after was entirely, ended by the announcement of dinner.    , It fell to Gerald's lot to lead Constance to the table; or rather he assumed that privilege, which he would not forego. After dinner the company wandered out to find cool seats in thel arbors or under the great trees that shaded the lawn. Gerald found himself tjte-.-tete with Constance under the shadow of a mighty elm. "You are a student of law, Mr. Mostyn. That study has frequently been pronounced dry. But I will venture to say that you do not find it so," said Miss Wynne. "I certainly do not," replied Gerald, with a look that , seemed to ask, "But how did you discover that?" She answered his look. "I consider the law, as the science of human justice, one of the most interesting' subjects of study in the world. Had I been a man, I should, as you have done, adopted that profession."  "That is to say, if you had been, as I am, without fortune, and under the necessity of adopting some pro. fession." "Nol   I should in any case. Mr. Mostyn, I do not think that any amount of wealth enfranchises a human   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHEaY.        83, being from the duty of laboring in some department of hnman industry." "You are right, Miss Wynne I perfectly right." "I often wish," said Constance, "that there were some harder work for me than playing at domestic economy; not -that I fail to appreciate that good, old-fashioned science; much comfort and happiness depend upon its being well understood and faithfully practiced. But an energetic woman in my circumstances might do all that and have ample time to crave with a mighty hunger some more en- grossing occupation. A fortune is positively a misfortune to some women." "You say that, Miss Wynne?" i "I should have made such a good working farmer's oj mechanic's daughter I I must continue to play at house- keeping-when Mrs. Horton will permit me--for I find it as hard to get even that to do as if I had to earn my living by it. But, doubtless, future years will bring their work, for aspirations are prophecies." "This girl is the woman I dreamed of, long years before I ever saw her face or heard her voice. Oh, surely fate does not mean to mock me in bringing me to her side," thought Gerald, as he listened to the) words so in harmony with his thoughts. And soon, without egotism on his side, or intrusion on hers, they slid into conversing confidentially upon the sub- ject of his history and prospects. And as he talked with her, somehow the loss of his patrimony seemed to dwindle into a matter of the least possible significance, while his profession and future career arose into a consideration of ,the utmost importance. So they lingered under the shadow of the elm-tree, conversing, until the sun sank down behind the horizon, and the full moon arose in glory over the mountain tops.  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7861-00000033"/> ,CHAPTER    VII. 'I do refer me to the oracle- Break up the seals and read.-S-hakspeare. "TEA is served, Miss Wynne," said old David, bowing before the young couple, who had been too deeply engaged in conversation to hear his'approach. The company were already moving towards the house, and Constance arose, and invited Gerald to follow. The tea-table, draped from top to floor with snow-white damask, adorned with the Pekin tea-service, and covered with all the delicacies of the season and of good house- wifery, stood glittering under the light of a hanging chan- delier. Mrs. Horton, very stately in her black velvet dress and elaborate lace cap, stood at the head. On her right-hand side was Lord Starr. Colonel North stood at the foot. Ladies and gentle- men, arranged alternately, occupied the sides, with the exception of the first and second places on the left-hand of the hostess, which were left for Constance and Gerald. As soon as these latter took their seats, the company, who had been waiting for them, sat down Each guest was promptly served, and conversation became general and animated. When tea was over, the company adjourned to the draw- ing-room, where, soon after, the guests invited for the evening joined them. The first arrivals were Mr. and Mrs. Osborne and Mr. Heath. Immediately after them came Dr. and Mrs. James (84)   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        85 Horne-the doctor a man of great fashion and elegance, the lady a delicate, pensive woman, with a sort of sad, moonlight face, beaming softly out between her fleecy locks of jet. And, last of alr, to the astonishment of everybody, came old Mr. Horne, who had been invited as a matter of courtesy, and was not in the least degree expected to make his appearance. The old gentleman was of medium height, and spare habit, slightly bent, yet not without some re- maining elegance of form. ' He had high, thin, aquiline features, and a bald receding forehead, fringed around the temples and the back of the head with venerable silver locks. He was dressed with scrupulous care in a suit of clerical black, relieved by delicate shirt frills, and adorned by a richly-wrought chain. In a word, there was no ex- ternal sign of the genus miser about the man. He came not alone. On his arm he brought a young girl, uninvited, but whom, with grave courtesy, he pre- sented to his hostess as Miss Owen, the daughter of a deceased friend, and now his ward, who had arrived only that morning, and whom, presuming on Mrs. Horton's well-known kindness, he had ventured to present to her. Enough! Thus commended to" her consideration, the old gentlewoman received the young maiden, bidding her warmly welcome to Llyndell. The appearance of the young stranger arrested every eye-not only that such an arrival in a quiet country circle always attracts attention, but also that, in this instance, the object was highly likely to excite a sensation. Alice Owen was a beauty-not certainly of the noble order of Constance Wynne, nor yet of the waxen style of the Misses Horton--but with the glowing, oriental type, of the Asiatic girl. Her figure was petite, exquisitely pro- portioned, and gracefully rounded. Her features werde regular and softly moulded; her complexion was of the 6  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7861-00000034"/> *-86    T HE  GIPSY'S  PR OPHECY. clearest olive, deepening in the, cheeks and lips into the most glowing bloom; her eyes were of the darkest hazel, long-lashed, languid, and full of suppressed fire; a wealth of sunbright chestnut curls clustered around her beautiful face. Heer dress of deep mourning could not disguise- perhaps it even enhanced her voluptuous style of beauty. In a word, she was a girl to inspire at first sight the most ardent passion, if not the most lasting attachment. But she also possessed a latent charm more powerful even than her dark loveliness-it was the undeniable air of goodness and truth, that only appeared to those who intimately con- versed with her. Mrs. Horton, a reader of faces, was certainly attracted towards her; and, after a little talk, that confirmed her first favorable impressions, she took the hand. of the orphan girl, and conducted her to the group formed by the Misses Horton, Captain Starr, Mr. Heath, Mr. Mostyn, and Miss Wynne. Modest, yet genial, the young stranger glided gracefully into the spirit of the..youthful circle to which she was in- troduced. Under the auspices of Miss May Horton, they were just about to form what she called a Sybil's Circle, for which purpose Messrs. Heath and Starr were dispatched to bring forward a round table. Miss May went to a cabinet to seek- the "- Sybil's Leaves," which she presently produced. All the youthful party then seated themselves around the table-that is, all except Constance, who held back, -and Gerald, who seemed to abide her decision. "Come, Miss Wynne, we await you," spoke Captain Starr. "Come, Constance, come I' exclaimed May, the destined "Sybil" of the evening. "I dare not. Even in sport I dare not tempt again the   THE  GIPSYtS PROPHE    Y.    s87 revelation of the future," said Constance, in a low whisper - to her companion. Startled at seeing again this one weakness of her other- wise perfect character, Mr. Mostyn smiled. Ah- what power his smile or frown already possessed for her! "I will go," she saide suddenly; and, turning a shade paler, she took her seat at the mystic table. ; Mr. Mostyn placed himself beside her. A dead silence reigned. May shuffled the cards, turned them with their faces down, and then, addressing her right- hand neighbor, Captain Starr, inn a low voice, she de- manded- "What would you with the Sybil?" "I would know the future partner of my life," was the formal answer.  "Draw!" The young man hesitated for awhile, smiled, and, reject- ing all those cards that were nearest himself, put his hand under the pack, and withdrew the lowest one. "Read," he said, extending the card to the Sybil. "Hear," she exclaimed- "A widow, beautiful as light, 'Twill be your lot to wed-- With-a rich jointure, which shall pour Its blessings on your head." There was a general clapping of hands, and shouts of laughter, amid exclamations of- "A widow 1" "Oh, Captain Starr, who would have thought it!" "And where will he pick up such a paragon of a wealthy widow?" "I'll tell youl Dr. Horne will take one of his own pre- scriptions by mistake one of these days, and then-" ' Oh, yes I I've noticed how the captain seems to ad- mire the lady "'  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7861-00000035"/> 88    'THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. "Surely, ladies, there is no harm in respectful admira- tion," suggested the young man. "Oh, certainly notl Certainly notl Especially of brilliant young widows!" "I hate young widows 1" broke forth the captain. General and ringing laughter followed this promulga- tion of sentiment. The hilarity attracted the attention of the elder members of the party, who, growing tired of politics and theology, drew near the group around the table. "What aSe we about, young ladies " questioned Lord Starr, who took his stand behind the Sybil's chair. "Telling fortunes ' an' it please your lordship," answered Miss Violet. -"Stand by and you will see some fun." "You are to be father-in-law to a widow!" said Miss Lily. "Won't you try your fortune, sir?" asked Miss May. "With great pleasure," returned Lord Starr. "What would you with the Sybil?" "I would know the future partner of my life." "Draw!" Lord Starr laughingly drew a card, and handed it up to be read. '"Hear 1" exclaimed the Sybil, reading- --"'A miss in her teens." The laughter arose more wildly than before. "Oh, dear I A miss in her teens for his wife, and a widow for his daughter-in-law" " exclaimed half-a-dozen voices simultaneously; 'and under cover of the renewed laughter, the minister subsided into privacy. "It was now Miss Violet's turn to test her fate. Being a young lady, she would not put the question in the usual form, but merely inquired what should be her future fate. The answer drawn was- "To dandle fools and chronicle small beer," a reply that nearly extinguished Miss Violet for the eveninge   THE    GIPSY S  PROPHECY.        89 "I declare there is old Mr. Horne," exclaimed the lively Violet, as the old miser sauntered deliberately to the table, and stood looking with indolent curiosity upon the game of the young people. "Come Mr. Horne, I declare you shall have your fortune told." "The fortune of four-score years is well nigh told, young lady."       ' "Nay, no one's fate is complete while he lives. Draw." "Well, well, the commands of ladies are not to be dis- obeyed," replied the old man, gallantly, as he extended his hand and drew a card, which he passed to the Sybil. Amid a profound silence, and in a solemn-voice, she read- "Thy fate looms full of horror. From false friends, Near at hand, perdition threatens thee!- A fearful sign stands in thy house of life H An enemy-a fiend lurks close behind The radiance of thy planet.-Oh, be warned!" "Pshaw I what serious mockery!" exclaimed the old man, scornfully, as he turned away, and gave place to his nephew, who had all the while been posted behind him, peeping over his shoulder.                 r   I "Will you permit me to test my fortune?" inquired the "fascinating"Dr. Horne.

"Nonsense I Jugglery l" said the latter, turning away to conceal his disturbance. The eyes of Constance Wynne followed him with the deepest interest.- There was that upon his brow that she had never seen before. The next in course was Alice. Turning to her, May said- "What seek you in the magic circle, lady?" "My destiny," answered the luscious tones.

Besides--now that she is shaken as by a storm-now that the power of the god is upon her, she becomes truly inspired and prophetic-her words are destinies!" exclaimed Mr. Heath, in mock gravity. "Assuredly," assented the others. And May was forced to resume her seat.   THE    GIPSY'S;  PROPHEICY.       91 "Your turn is next. Draw, sir!" she said, pushing the tablets towards the last-named gentleman. Mr. Heath drew a leaf, and passed it to the Sybil, who read- "I see the cloud and the tempest near, The voice of the troubled tide I hear- Thy bosom's bark on th surge I see, And, wanderer, thy loved one is there with tee!" "Dark, indeed; as the sayings of the Sybil usually are," said Mr. Heath, smiling ruefully. "Foreboding, still foreboding! Oh, let me resign this office!" prayed May. "Not for the world, now that each word is fate I There is a couple yet to be disposed of.   Miss Wynne, draw near," said Mr. Heath. The cheek of Constance Wynne changed; yet striving with a feeling that she felt- to be unworthy, she smiled, reached forth her hand, drew a tablet, and passed it to the Sybil, who, in an effective voice, read-  "A dream is on my soul 1 I see a bride-all crowned with flowers, and smiling, As in delighted visions, on the brink Of a dread chasm!" - Constance heard in silence, remembering the strange correspondence of these lines with the prediction of the wandering gipsy, endeavoring to convince herself that it was mere coincidence, and vainly trying to subdue the foreboding of her heart. "Mr. Mostyn," said May, shuffling   the tablets, and passing them to him. '  He drew a card, and returned it to be perused.

An irrepressible low cry broke from. the pallid lips of Constance. "Throw up the -cards l" she said; "it is wicked-this tampering with the mysteries of the future!" May quickly swept them from the table, and the circle broke up in a strange dismay. "She has one weakness 1" said Gerald, reflecting upon this peculiar idiosyncracy of Constance Wynne.

Refreshments, no  brought in and served around, created some diversion mong -le young people, and gave some agreeable occupation to the old. 'But Constance Wynne could not, during the remainder of the evening, recover her serenity. The company soon afterwards broke up.  The guests that had been invited for the evening took leave, and de- parted to ride home by the pleasant moonlight. In bidding his grandson good-night, old Mr. Horne had said- "I shall expect to see you at the house before your de parture for the city, Gerald." "I thank you, sir," returned the latter, with a grave bow; for he understood this surly invitation only as a matter of form, and did not dream of an acceptance. S   .  f     CHAPTER     VIII,. And he loved her-certes, As he loved all heavenly objects, with uplifted eyes and hands; As he loved pure inspiration-loved the graces-loved the muses, In a love content with writing its own name on desert sands. E. B. Broanins MRS. HORTON had her own private opinions concerning the attraction that drew the, great minister from the cares of state and the circle of a court down to this remote country neighborhood. And ere a week had passed she found her conjectures to be correct. Lord Starr had met Constance Wynne for the first time at the Derby. He had been pleased with her from the first, and his approbation increased with time and reflection. In a word, he had come down to Wales with the fixed determination of making her his wife, and he had seized all the opportunities afforded by his visit to advance his suit with the heiress. But Constance was very shy, and used all her feminine tact to avoid his society without discourtesy, and to escape his direct proposal. Gerald Mostyn, with jealous pain, observed this seeking by the one party and avoiding by the other. Constance, to put an end to this state of affairs, one morning gave Lord Starr the interview he so intensely de- sired and so pertinaciously sought. When, with all the graceful self-possession and grave suavity of a mature courtier, he had declared his admiration of the lady, and made her the proffer -of his heart and hand, Constance replied-- "I am deeply sensible Bof the honor your preference con- (93)  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7861-00000038"/> "    TH-E GIPS-Y'S PROPHECY. fers upon me, Lord Starr, even while I feel constrained to decline it." "Miss Wynne, permit me to hope that this is not your final answer," said his lordship. "Lord Starr, permit me to hope that you will not again compel me to seem ungrateful for the distinction you would confer upon me," replied Constance, very gravely. "Then I have nothing to hope?" "Beyond my esteem and gratitude, nothing, Lord Starr," replied Constance, firmly. The rejected suitor accepted his fate, and bade a sudden adieu to the lady and her family. But not for a moment was Constance deceived by his suavity. She caught the quick, and quickly withdrawn dark, fiery glance of hatred shot beneath his black brows at Gerald Mostyn and at herself; and she felt that the keen eyes of jealousy had detected a fact hidden from all but herself. "There are men," she reflected, "who, being kindly re- jected as lovers, may be retained as friends; but this man is not one of these. I have made a mortal enemy of Lord Starr. " In this opinion, certainly, the head of the family coin- cided. "Oh, Constance, Constance, my child, what have you done? Lord Starr has departed in high displeasure. I see it even under all his politeness. Oh, Constance, what have you done?" inquired Mrs. Horton, as she sat alone with her grand-daughter in the parlor, after the exit of her guest. "Nothing that should disturb the equanimity of his lord- ship.  I have gratefully declined his alliance, that is all." "Oh, Constance, Constance, you have rejected so lofty a position, with all the advantages and emoluments it might have enabled you to heap upon your family and friends I   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY.      95 Oh, Constance, you have-no ambition 1" said the old lady, lifting up both hands in rebuke. "Oh, Constance, you have no ambition 1" "On the] contrary, my dear grandmother, ambition is my besetting sin. I crave distinction with a sinful craving." "And yet you rejected this high destiny?" The distinction I want must be a purely personal one- must develop from within me, and must be my own. Should an emperor take me by the hand and seat me beside him upon the throne to share his empire, I should not call that distinction. I should call it an accident, or an em- peror's caprice.  But should I, striving side by side in the battle of life with one I honored, win victory and dominion  " Constance paused and-caught her breath At the vividness and splendor of the future her imagination conjured up. "Romantic girl! well, you are only eighteen. But oh, Constance, you have not only lost a high position, but you have made a powerful enemy. Child, had you no fear?" "None. Lord Starr is at least an honorable enemy." "Girl, girl I the enmity that grows from jealousy is never honorable ; it is secretive, unjust, vindictive, and much to be feared. No man- of your race, Constance, need ever ex- pect political preferment or official favor, if Lord Starr has the power to intercept or withhold it." "Well," said Constance, yawning and laughing, "as none of my friends are seeking office, they will not be likely to need political advancement, and as none of them have offended against the majesty of the laws, they-will not be likely to pray in vain the ministerial clemency." But, immediately after uttering these last words, the whole aspect of the speaker changed-she suddenly paused, grew pale and shuddered.  She thought of the gipsy's prophecy.  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7861-00000039"/> 96     THE   GIPSY'S    PROPHtCY. "Why, Constance, my child, what ails you?" asked the old lady. "Nothing-nothing--a sudden shiver, that is all. There, it is over now," said the young girl, with a great effort re- gaining her composure. The conversation ceased there, as Mrs. Horton withdrew to attend to her affairs. Ah, before much time had passed, with what bitterness Constance Wynne remembered     the  girlish scorn with which she had received the idea of ever seeking political advancement, or needingsministerial favor. CH APTER IXL: "Theirs, too, the glance none saw beside, The smile none else might understand The whispered thought of souls allied, The pressure of the thrilling hand; The hearts so sinless and refined, That love each warmer wish forbore. Her eyes proclaimed so pure a mind, Even, passion blushed to plead for more; The tone that taught him to rejoice, When prone, unlike her, to repine- The song celestial from her voice Raised him from earth to realms divine." MUCH relieved by the departure of his powerful rival, Gerald Mostyn continued the favored and happy guest of Llyndell. Early every morning he rode out with Miss Wynne and her cousins; but before the ride was over he was almost sure to find himself tte-d-.tte with Constance, being either in advance or in the rear of the riding-party. During the later hours of the forenoon, he entertained the young ladies by reading aloud to them while they worked   THE  GIfSY'S PROPHECY.        97 at their embroidery frames; but before the reading was over he was almost certain to find himself in warm and con. fidential discussion with Constance alone, one after another of the girls having withdrawn upon some slight pretext. Why didl the Misses Horton act in this manner? First, because, with the quick perception of womanhood; they had seen the growing attachment between Gerald and Constance; secondly, because; with the unreasoning sensi- bility of girlhood, they really sympathized with the lovers; thirdly, because, being themselves somewhat worldly, they could feel no possible jealousy of their cousin's handsome though penniless admirer. Thus every facility was afforded Mr. Mostyn for advanc- ing his interests with the noble Constance. Did he avail himself of his opportunities? We all know how persuasive an advocate is Hope when we once admit her to our counsels. Gerald Mostyn did not understand the overweening pride of the heads of the family with whom he sojourned-that pride which, in treating him upon equal terms, ignored the very possibility of his aspi-- ration to an alliance-with any daughter of the -house. He only felt that every rational encouragement was held out to him. He reviewed the circumstances-Mrs. Horton and Colonel North exhibited towards him the greatest kindness and re- spect. The Misses Horton tacitly recognized him as the suitor of their cousin. Constance herself reciprocated his regard; he knew it by the " secret sympathy" of- their yet unspoken love, Yet still he hesitated. How could he, a poor and strug- gling young man, venture to propose for the hand of her, the richest heiress in the state, without exposing himself to the charge of mercenary motives, abuse of hospitality, and gross ingratitude?

It was the evening previous to the morning of his in- tended departure. Mrs. Horton and Colonel North had retired. The young people were promenading upon the long vine- shaded porch in front of the house. But one by one they dropped off into the drawing-room, until at length, as usual, Gerald Mostyn found himself alone with Constance Wynne. Their conversation upon different matters had died out- each being indisposed to speak upon the subjects that con- cerned neither. The near departure of Gerald occupied the thoughts and oppressed the hearts of both. An almost irresistible impulse tempted him to speak-to tell herat least of the love that filled his heart, and the scruples that withheld him from asking her hand. But then he, thought such a course of conduct would give him the appearance of throwing himself upon her generosity, an attitude not to be thought of for an instant. "No  no!" he mentally exclaimed, "though my heart swells to bursting, I must be silent I silent 1" Meanwhile Constance, her hand trembling upon his arm, read his soul as an open book. Her own deep love made her feel the profundity of his passion-her own delicate sense of honor made her understand the fastidiousness of his scruples. Could her secret prayer have annihilated those scruples, they would have disappeared. But she-a maiden--might pray, but must not breathe aloud the meaning of her prayer-no I not to save both their hearts from life-long misunderstanding and estrangement. And he, knowing this, would he, could he depart, without using his masculine privilege of confessing his love, so that her own, unblamed, might meet and bless it? Was there, then, no innocent womanly-wile by-which she might beguile from him the words he longed to speak, she longed to   THER  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY.       99 hear, yet which he ventured not to utter 7 She thought of Desdemona, of Miranda, and of:Juliet, who,-it must be confessed, met their lovers considerably more than half- way. But there was something in her nature that repelled the first suggestions of artifice. In its simple, majestic truth, her mind resembled the Ionic column--pure, white, stately, upright, unswerving. She could even more easily have said-"Gerald, speak to me, for I love you"--than she would have used any feminine arts to draw such-a declaration from him. While these various thoughts and feelings occupied the lovers, they pursued their walk up and down the vine- shaded porch. There was no light save that of stars that occasionally twinkled through the dew-sprinkled foliage on the front side, and the faint gleam of the lamps through the closed shutters of the drawing-room on the other side. They continued to walk on in silence, her hand trembling upon his arm, its motion felt and re-echoed from his heart. Feeling the temptation to clasp her to his bosom, and pour the history of his great love into her ear, growing every instant stronger, becoming almost irresistible, and- wishing, above all things, to preserve his integrity, he re- solved to put an immediate period to the interview. Paus- ing, therefore, in his promenade, he said- "Miss Wynne, forgive my thoughtlessness, I have de- tained you too long exposed to the damp evening air." "Oh, no, no," began Constance; but her deep tones vibrated as the chords of an seolian harp when swept by, the wind, and died away in silence. "Permit me to lead you in and to bid you-farewell 1" "Farewell!" she echoed, in a thrilling voice-"Oh I surely not yet, farewell? We shall see you to-morrow morning?"          , 7  "Ah, no I Colonel North has kindly placed a horse and groom at my service, and I depart at daybreak to meet  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7861-00000041"/> 100    THE   GIPSY'S  PROPHECY. the train at Bleakton," he answered, mournfully, as he led her towards the hall-door. Arrived thither, he paused, took her hand respectfully, and held it while he said- "Constance, permit me to thank you for all the kindness you have shown towards '-a poor, wayfaring' young man,- to acknowledge most gratefully all the faith, hope, and strength with which you have inspired him,--to bless you, Constance, and to say--farewell for ever!" :He lifted her throbbing hand to his lips, pressed upon it a burning kiss, resigned it, and turned away. "Gerald!" It was only his name, breathed in a low voice by Con- stance Wynne; but all the deep, passionate emotion of her soul vibrated along its syllables. "Oh, there are looks and tones that dart, An instant sunshine through the heart, As if the soul that moment caught A something it through life had sought!" "Constance I Constance!" he responded. He was at her side, at her feet in an instant. Andthen and there the sealed fountain of love was set free. He told her all I -his youthful dream of the ideal woman who should be the companion of his life; his meeting with her in the church; his recognizing her as his ideal; his mistaking her, through the simplicity of her dress and manner, for some poor though noble girl, whom he resolved to seek out and woo; his despair on discovering her to be an heiress; his vain struggle with his growing love; his final resolution to depart without declaring his feelings; and, last of all, that little touch of true nature which had melted the- seal of silence from lis heart. She heard him out, and then broke forth in eloquent reply. She asked how it was possible that he, understand- ing her nature as he claimed to do, should suppose her capable of misconstruing his motives; or how it happened   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY.      101 that he, indifferent to accidents of fortune as he professed to be, should yet affix so' much importance to her posses- sion of wealth as to make that circumstance an obstacle to a good understanding between them? He smiled, and said- "Your straightforward, trenchant nature, noble girl, would cut the gordian not, rather than untie it. Well, dearest Constance! all that I have to offer you, is an up- right heart that has never swerved from rectitude; afresh heart that has never before bowed before the shrine of womanhood; a constant heart through good or ill, for time and eternity, that is wholly yours. Years may pass, dear- est girl, before I shall be in a position to claim this cov- eted hand; and to ask you to contract yourself in so long and uncertain an engagement would be ungenerous; there- fore, dearest Constance, while I bind myself irrevocably to you as my liege lady, I would fain leave you unfettered by any promise." "As if I would consent to so one-sided and unjust an engagement I No, Gerald I my nature demands that every engagement to which I may be a party must be justly pro- portioned, clearly defined, well understood.

And Constance sought her pillow, not to sleep-but to lie dreaming ' love's young dream." And for hours longer Gerald paced up and down the vine-shaded porch in a dizzy trance of joy, then sought his couch to dream of-Constance. CHAPTER X.

IN the morning, according to previous orders, David Tapped at the chamber-door, waking Mr. Mostyn from a delicious dream of going to housekeeping with Constance Gerald immediately sprang out of bed, and admitted his early attendant. "Well, is this you, David?" "Yes, please sur; and here's hot water to shave, and day's broke, and your coffee's waiting, and the horses, too!" Well, well, David, let the horses be put back into the stable. I shall not go this morning. But tell me, what time does the colonel rise?" "About an hour from this, sur." "Ver well.  Let them know down-stairs that I shall not gQ:tihis morning; and do you come to me at the end of aior from this to take a note to the colonel." "Yes, sur," said the man, departing.  Gerald proceeded to make his morning toilet, and after- wards to write a note, explaining that circumstance had war    uOte, ex   THE GIPSY'S PROPHECY.  10o i0   arisen to delay his departure for a few hours, and begging the favor of an interview with Colonel North, at the ear- liest convenience of the latter. This he sealed, and sent by his attendant to the bedside of his host. Colonel North immediately returned a verbal answer, to the effect that he would be happy to see Mr. Mostyn in his study directly after breakfast. Soon after receiving this reply, Gerald went down-stairs and joined the family at their morning meal. Mrs. Horton politely expressed her satisfaction at hav- ing the pleasure of her guest's society for some time longer; and the young ladies rallied him unmercifully for losing his journey, as they said, by oversleeping himself. Con- stance, as usual, calm, simple, and stately, neither said nor did any thing to betray herself. Colonel North, evidently moved by curiosity to know what the young gentleman could have to say to him in pri- vate, and far -from suspecting the truth, was the first to retire from the breakfast-room. Colonel North's study was the little front room on the' second-floor, immediately over the entrance hall. Thither Gerald repaired, to find the colonel already awaiting him. The old gentleman rose and tendered a seat. The young man declined it with a bow, and standing before his host, opened the subject of his visit. In a simple, manly, and dignified manner, he declared his love for Constance Wynne, and his desire to make her his wife. Colonel North sank back in his chair, and gazed up at Gerald Mostyn with incredulous astonishment.  That he, a poor student of law, should aspire :to the hand of Constance Wynne; that he should venture to con. fess such a flagrant presumption; that he should even date to' request him, her guardian, to sanction such high au. dacity, struck him with constern:  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7861-00000043"/> 104    THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY.      j He sat perfectly silent, and staring at the suitor . . Under that regard of arrogant amazement, Gerald Mostyn felt his high spirit rising.      ' "Well, Colonel North, I await your answer," he said, with calm dignity. But the colonel stared on, in blank panic, finding no terms in which to reply. Mr. Mostyn was fast losing his patience. Nevertheless, he still controlled himself, and, after a moment, said, quietly- "Colonel North, I beg to remind you, sir, that I have just had the honor to lay before you certain proposals, authorized by Miss Wynne, and which await your answer." "My answer, sir I Sir, I am astonished 1 I am over- whelmed with consternation, sir I Constance Wynne, sir 7 Do you happen to know who she is, sir? Are you aware of her social position, sir? of her high pretensions, sir? of her brilliant prospects, sir?" "Colonel North, I believe that I am fully aware of all the circumstances which you have taken the pains to bring to my recollection. Furthermore, I know Miss Wynne; and knowing, love her; and loving, desire to make her my wife," said the young man with stately courtesy. "Then, sir, I can only repeat that I am amazed, sirl- yes, sir, astounded, sir! .-yes, sir, thunderstruck, sir, at your effrontery 1" "Permit me to recall to you, Colonel North, the fact that Miss Wynne herself has authorized the proposals that I have the honor to submit to you." "Sir,-you leave me without words to express myself 1" "Pardon me for observing that that is no answer to my proposal. Allow me to state it afresh: I love your ward, Miss Wynne; I request your sanction to my engagement with her; and I attend for your answer," said Gerald Mostyn, with great dignity.   THE   GIPSY'S PROPIECY.      105 "My answer, sir I You cannot for a moment be at a loss for it, sir. Marry Constance Wynne, sir? No, sir I assuredly nlot, sir I most assuredly not, sir I I tell you that-that I stand appalled at the question " "Very well I having at length received a distinct answer, I have only to wish you good morning, colonel," said the young man, bowing, somewhat ironically. Colonel North now in some degree recovered himself, and recollected what became him as a host, and what was due to Mr. Mostyn as his guest. Rising, he said, rather inconsistently, and perhaps somewhat sarcastically- "Yes, sir I Miss Wynne's family, of course, feel highly honored by the very flattering proposal you have made them; and they regret very much that for many cogent reasons they should be forced to decline the distinction you designed them. Good morning, sir," the colonel concluded, rather abruptly, seeing, in fact, that Mr. Mostyn, deeply disgusted, was not disposed to endure the continuation of his speech; Gerald bowed once more, and withdrew. Assured of Constance's love, he cared very little for her guardian's unreasonable opposition. A few years, he knew, if they did not bring Colonel North to a more rational and humane view of the case, would, at least, enfranchise Constance from his authority. With these hopeful feelings he went down-stairs and sought her presence. As his "audacious proposal" had not yet been mentioned in the family, no opposition was made to their meeting. He found Constance in the midst of her cousins, in the family sitting-room. He greeted the ladies, and took his seat among them; and for a while all conversed gayly and pleasantly. But presently Miss Violet called Miss May to help her bind up a honeysuckle vine that was drooping from the  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7861-00000044"/> 106   'THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY. porch, and Miss Lily volunteered to render her assistance also; and, as usual, Constance and Gerald were left tete-a- tete. He went to her side, and took her hand. She looked up inquiringly into his face. mnailed mournfully. ell, Gerald?" "Well, dearest Constance, I this morning availed myself of your permission to lay my hopes before Colonel North." "And the result?" "Was what we might have anticipated-a rejection of my suit."  Gerald refrained from saying how scornful and insulting this rejection had been. "Well, what matters it? It was our duty to have no concealments from  my guardian, but to make known to him at once our purposes.  I even expected his opposi- tion; it is of no real importance; for though while I am rightfully under his authority, I will, of course, obey him, yet, when I am my own mistress, I shall follow the rational dictates of my own mind. In two years from next Christ- mas I shall have reached my   legal majority, shall be mistress of myself and of my fortune. At the end of that time, dear Gerald, you will claim me as your wife; and until that time regard me as your betrothed!" she said, and frankly held out her hand. He caught and pressed it to his heart. Thenhe took from around his neck a little black ribbon, with a slender gold ring attached to it. "This, dear Constance, was my  mother's weddinglring. She, in dying, placed it on my finger, and bade me wear it until I should tramsfer it to my betrothed. I wore it on  my hand until my finger outgrew it, then I attached it to this ribbon, and wore it round my neck. Will you let me now obey my mother's behest, and place it upon the finger of my betrothed?" *               . '4,2   THER  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        107 '"Yes; and the pledge shall be as sacred as if placed there in the church by the minister of God,"-said Constance, solemnly, holding out her left hand. He slipped the ring upon the third finger, lifted the lovely hand to his lips for an instant, and resigned it. "Constance, I may write to you?" he inquired. - "Assuredly, unless our correspondence should be forbid- den by my guardian, in which case we must submit and be patient, I suppose. The years will wear around at last." Again her hand was lifted, and pressed warmly to his lips, and dropped abruptly, for lo 1 Mrs. Horton, with se- vere aspect, appeared within the door-Mrs. Horton, who had just learned from Colonel North " the audacious pro. posals of Mr. Mostyn." She entered, nodding stiffly, took her seat, drew her knitting work from her ample pocket, and began steadily and silently to ply her needles. No more opportunity of private conversation was afforded the lovers. In half an hour from that time Gerald Mostyn bade adieu to the family; and declining- the proffer of a horse and groom,set out to walk up to Bleakton, which he reached by noon, and whence he sent a messenger to Llyndell to fetch his luggage. And by the next morning's train, Mr. Mostyn journeyed towards London, which he reached in due time. It had been agreed between Mrs. Horton and Colonel North that it would be the best policy to refrain from men- tioning to Constance the subject of her discarded lover, that he might perchance be thfe more easily forgotten. Thus Constance was left in peace. And when the next mail brought her a letter from Geo- rald, with several other epistles, for Constance had quite, an extensive correspondence among her late sc mates, it escaped notice. And when she-answered it, and gave the answer, with other similar-looking missives, into the hands  *i,           "4  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7861-00000045"/> T'1'E 0ijPSY ' S PROPHECY*. ' of the messenger, the act escaped comment. In short, though Constance disdained to make a secret of the fact, yet, either because her guardians did not really know of its existence, or that they did not think it politic to draw the chains of authority too tightly around her, or else because they had absolute confidence in her integrity, or for what- ever reason; it is certain that the correspondence was not interfered with. By every Monday's mail she received a letter from her lover; and by every Thursday's mail she replied to it. Their letters were faithful transcripts of their daily lives. Thus Constance knew and shared the arduous labors, hopes, and aspirations of Gerald at his chambers; and Gerald en- joyed with Constance the sweetness of her quiet rural days. Her life was made more earnest by her sympathy with his mental toils; and his studies were enlivened, his hopes re- vived, and his strength renewed by her tender affection, un. swerving constancy and inspiring faith. *   .*    *   *    *   * We-will not weary our readers by narrating in detail the struggles of Gerald Mostyn up the thorny steep of fame. It is enough for our purpose to say, that in two years from the time of his first admission to practice in the courts, he was generally known as a very highly talented and rising young lawyer. In the commencement of the third year of his profes- sional career, he was retained by the defendants in a civil suit of great importance, upon the issue of which immense wealth pended, and in which already the highest legal talent of the kingdom was on either side opposed. Mr. Mostyn, in addition to his other great advantages, pos- sessed the supreme one of faith in the justice of his client's cause.;  suit was long pending. Some of the most re- nowned lawyers, whose names now grace the nation's councils and the circles of foreign diplomacy, were iiis   colleagues. Their speeches-models of judicial oratory- preceded his own. But he had the reviewing of the case- the closing speech. And his address to the jury was not only a masterpiece of legal knowledge, sound logic, and moving eloquence: it was an overwhelming power, a magnificent triumph - Without leaving their seats, the jury returned a verdict for the defendants. And all knew that the cause was saved by this splendid young orator, who had burst as a new sun upon the world. His success was an ovation.  His brother lawyers gathered around him with congratulations.

He pressed it to his lips; he wore it next t his heart. Meanwhile, for him, success followed success with dazzling rapidity. He would not touch an unjust cause; but a just one in his hands was sure of triumph. At the close of the court term, he turned his attention to politics, the twin-sister of- law. He embraced the interests of the liberal party, and as his person, fame, and eloquence, became known to the people, his name was caught up and advanced as a candidate for the. House of Commons; and, borne on the swelling tide of popular favor, he was elected to represent the borough of Wilton in Parliament. About this time he renewed, by letter, his proposals for the hand of Miss Wynne; but, notwithstanding his brilliant success, he was again, upon the ground of his want of fortune, rejected by her guardian. But now an event was approaching destined to change the whole current of his future life. CHAPTER XI.

The brilliant success of Gerald Mostyn had produced its natural effect upon his churlish relative, old Hugh Horne, dwelling in his remote and lonely home at Horne's Hol i Now, whether, as was likely, the old man's mind was failing, or from whatever cause it might have been, he certainly did not act with his habitual caution in expressing his senti- ments; but to his frequent visitor, Dr. Horne, he would often say- "Ah, ha I that puppy Mostyn is turning out better than one could have expected, eh?" "Hem-m I let us hope that it is so, sir; but adventurers are unreliable persons," would be the cool reply of the doctor.  Whereupon old Hugh Horne would secretly turn upon his nephew a keen glance, from under the cover of his bushy brows, reading his very soul. At another time he said- "Bravo, James  I -- congratulate you. Your cousin Gerald is getting on. His gaining of the Goldsborough suit is said to be one of the greatest triumphs of the season."  "Hem-m, yes,.sir; though, for my own part, I should think that reckless young man quite as likely to die by the law, as to live by-it," dryly returned Dr. Horne. "Take care, lad I ' Evil prophecies, like chickens, often come home to roost ' " Again, a few months after, he exclaimed- "Ha, James, wish me joy I My grandson, Mr. Mostyn, has been elected to a seat in the House of Commons.

From the evening upon which this conversation occurred, Hugh Hornets health of mind and body declined. Dr. Horne redoubled his attentions to the invalid, and at, the same time reported every where that his days were  numbered, that no art of medicine could prolong his life,  or do more-than modify his sufferings.&amp; Affairs went on in this manner for some weeks longer,X when old Hugh Horne, with the caprice of illness, suddenly' dismissed his nephew from professional attendance upon him, and declared that'none should prescribe for him ex-X cept young Mr. Heath, who had lately received his diploma i A as a practitioner.

" ascribe to the infatuations of dotage, he repressed all evi- dences of his deep feeling of--humiliation, and, taking the old man at his former word, actually continued to visit him as a friend. Every one who heard of this change of doc- tors, ascribed the conduct of old Hugh Horne to the caprice of dotage, and characterized the act as one of extreme in- justice, for Dr. Horne's acknowledged skill as a physician was only equalled by his great personal popularity. But strangely enough, and doubtless from another caprice --to wit, of nature-from the day of Dr. Horne's dismissal, the old man, under the care of young Doctor Heath, and the tender nursing of gentle Alice Owen, rapidly con- valesced. And not only restoration of health to mind and body, but regeneration of spirit, seemed possible for this octo- genarian forgetter of God. His better thoughts were, under divine providence, mainly due to the sweet influence of his orphan ward. Daily and nightly the prayers of gentle Alice ascended for the poor old man, for whom no other living creature prayed,-that time might be granted himt to prepare for the great change; that the root of bitterness might be drawn from his heart; that he might be led to "repentance not to be repented of;" that his soul might be saved alive. Daily she read to him from the holy Scriptures, and daily she presented, in her own lovely life, the beauty of Christianity-an example more powerful than the most eloquent precepts for the purposes of con- version. In her pious efforts, this meek follower of the Saviour was aided both by Mr. Heath and by Mr. Osborne, who, at the old man's express desire, came often to see him. Old as Mr. Horne was, it was pitiable to witness his anxiety to get well, and to live longer.

"Oh, sir,", she replied, "you know that our Heavenly Father accepts the disposition for the deed. Sincere re- pentance is the only satisfaction we can any of us ever make, and i it is received of our Lord, whose mercy is in- finitely greater than all our needs." Meanwhile winter approached, and the old man's physical health again fluctuated unfavorably, while his spiritual condition continued to improve. At' a distance, important events, interesting to other members of his family, were progressing. Parliament met, and the maiden speech of the Honorable Gerald Mostyn upon the income tax electrified the whole country with its tremendous power. In his leathern arm-chair, in his sick chamber at Horne's Hole, old Mr. Horne heard the report of this great triumph, and put on his spectacles to read the speech. "That boy knew what he was about when he went to Oxford. He was right and I was wrong I A hard ad- mission for an old man of eighty-two to make, eh, Alice? Alice, my dear, I do greatly desire to be at peace with all men. Take' a pen and ink, my child, and write to Mr. Mostyn, and desire him, from me, to come down, if he should have time, at Christmas, and spend the week with his old grandfather at Horne's Hole.-" The young girl joyfully obeyed, and the letter was written, and was, that same forenoon, despatched to Bleak- ton post-office.  In due time the answer arrived. Mr, Mostyn could not say whether he could stay a week at Christmas; but, in   TIE.  GIP SY'S PROPHECY.       1165 ally case, he would comply with his grandfathers request, and come down, if it were only for one day. Satisfied with this promise, the old man became tranquil, and now another letter came announcing to him that Mr. Mostyn would arrive at the Hole on the night of Christ. pas-eve; that he would spend Christmas-day with Mr. Horne, but that he should be obliged to' set .out on his re- turn to town on the morning of the twenty-sixth. This prospect of soon seeing his grandson filled the heart of the failing man with childish delight. And in the softness of his mood he pitied his old favorite, Dr. Horne, and, as usual, imparted his sentiments to Alice Owen, saying- "My dear, I am afraid that I have been at heart unjust to poor James, and if so, how very unjust. My dear, I distrust my own judgment. Better to err on 'the side of charity, is it not? At least I must have a candid interview , with him, put things upon a right footing, and have my purpose clearly understood. Take your pen, my dear, and write a note, and ask James to co me over here as soon as possible, for I am anxious to see him.' Alice immediately complied, and the note was despatched by a messenger. After an absence of two hours, the man returned with the answer that Dr. Horne was absent, and would not be home again for several days, but ihat he had left the note with Mrs. Horne.       q   - Dr. Home, in fact, reached home on the evening of the twenty-third of December, and- on the morning of the nexth  day-Christmas-eve--he hastened over to Horne's Hole to :'  obey the call of the old man. The uncle and nephew were closeted for several hours in a confidential interview, at the end of which Dr. Horne came out of the chamber with a gloomy and distracted brow, mounted his horse, and instantly rode home.  That same night, according to appointment, Gerauld Mostyn arrived. The old man welcomed him with cordial  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7861-00000049"/> "6    THE  GIPSY'S   PROPHECY. friendship, had a long and confidential conversation with hm, detaining him in his chamber until long after mid- night, and, in fact, until Gerald, fearing to injure him by keeping him from sleep, insisted upon retiring to his own room. The next day being Christmas, and fine, genial weather for the season, old Mr. Horne was dressed, and wheeled out in his chair to the parlor that adjoined his chamber, which was situated on the ground-floor. He wished to meet his family-what were left of them-once more at a Christmas dinner-table. There were present Dr. and Mrs. Horne, Mr. Mostyn, and Alice Owen. It was scarcely a merry Christmas feast; the old man, notwithstanding his age and decrepitude, was, perhaps, as cheerful as any of the others; Dr. Horne's hilarity was too hollow to be contagious, and his wife saw and sympathized with his mental disturbance; Gerald Mostyn's thoughts were absent with Constance Wynne; and Alice Owen, whose gentle and pliable nature was all too subject to receive its coloring from the mood of those around her, sat silent and pensive. As the mountain pass was very bad between Horne's Hole and Radnor's Ruin, and as the afternoons were short, it was necessary that, immediately after dinner, the doctor and his wife should set out for home. After they had taken leave and departed, the old man, and Gerald Mostyn and Alice Owen, gathered around the fire, and, strange as it may appear, the three felt, in- the absence of the others, a great weight lifted from their spirits. The hours were passed in cheerful conversation, until Alice went out to order supper; for it was necessary that the last meal should be early served, as the old man, greatly- fatigued, was anxious to retire to bed, and Mr. Mostyn was under the necessity of leaving the same night for Bleakton, to catch the early train for London.   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECO.        117 Alice was a thrifty little housekeeper, and under her auspices the supper was soon served. When the meal was over and the table cleared off, the household servants were brought together, and at the re quest of old Mr. Horne, Gerald Mostyn conducted the evening family worship. "I wish you would see me in my bed before you depart, Gerald," entreated the old man, who seemed to cling with childish weakness to the presence of his grandson. "With pleasure, sir," replied Mr. Mostyn, rising to assist the old man. "Good night, my dear Alice! God bless and. reward you for all your goodness!" he said, pressing the hand of his young nurse. "Not good night yet, sir. I shall look in before retir- ing, to see that you are quite comfortable." "Thank you, thank you, my dear," said Mr. Horne, as leaning on the strong arm of his grandson, he passed from the parlor into his chamber. Gerald assisted him in undressing, helped him into bed, and arrangecd his pillows and covering comfortably about him. Then, at the old man's request, he sat down beside him, and conversed until the clock struck ten, when he arose to take leave, and, with a promise-to return at the first op. portunity and spend a week at the Hole, he shook hands with his grandfather, left the room, bade Alice good-bye, mounted the horse thatstood awaiting his use, and rode off for Bleakton. After his departure, Alice arose from her seat by the parlor fire, and passed into her guardian's room,according to promise, to see if he was comfortable. The old man was lying so quietly, with his eyes closed and his hands folded upon his breast, that she thought he was sleeping, and shaded the lamp with her hand, lest its glare should -       -    -  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7861-00000050"/> "8    THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY. startle him. But he was already awake, and as se ap- proached, he opened his eyes, and said- "I am not asleep, Alice, my dear." "e'an I do anylthing for you, sir?" she inquired, gently. "No, my child."' "How do you feel after your fatiguing day?" "Better than for a long time past, dear'; better in the spirit, as well as in the flesh. Alice, I feel satisfied-I feel as if the Lord had accepted my late repentance.' "'Doubtless he has, dear sir. ' Are you wakeful? if so, shall I sit beside you and read or sing you to sleep?" "Thank you, dear girl. I am not wakeful, but inclined to -sleep; nevertheless, if you please, you may sit by me for a few minutes, and sing, in your own sweet voice, your fa- vorite hymn- "' wI would not live alway.'  Alice seated herself, and commenced in a low and tender key, to sing those beautiful but too pensive stanzas. The singing occupied no more than five or six minutes, and by the time the hymn was finished, the old man was in a deep and placid sleep. She stooped over him to assure herself of this. His eyes were calmly closed; his' lips gently compressed; his hands folded together as in prayer; his whole aspect serene as that of sleeping infancy. "May the Lord bless the poor old man," murmured Alice, as, shading the light with her hand, she softly glided from the room, and closed the door behind her. The fires were all out, the servants were all retired to their distant rooms; the house was solitary, silent, and gloomy. Alice secured the fastenings of the doors and windows, and then ascended to her own room, which was  immediately over that of old Hugh Horne. She offered up, her private devotions, and then blew out her candle and retired to bed.   THE   GIPSY'S PROPHECY.      II[ But for some strange reason, she could not sleep; never had the solitude, silence, and gloom of the old house so op- pressed her spirits. It was a starless, dark, and cloudy winter night, and the sighing of the wind through the wild mountain-gorges, and among the old beams and rafters of the gable roofs, sounded like the prophetic wailings of some household spirit. A vague presentiment of approaching evil, a deep impression of some atrocious agency drawing near, a dark overshadowing of some impending horror, weighed heavily upon her soul; a- wild impulse to start up, to cry out, to fly from the lonely house, assailed her. In vain she reasoned, prayed, and struggled to subdue this tremendous agitation of her spirits; for hours she turned and turned in wakeful terrors, or tossed about in frightful dreams. It must have been some time after midnight when she fell into the deep sleep of exhaustion from which she was terribly shocked-shocked by a single, prolonged, ap. palling cry, that rang through and through the lonely house, and out upon the silent night I CHAPTERt XIIr.

In the death-like still ness of the house no lowest sound stirred. Yes I hark I a voice that does but make the solitude and silence of the house and the hour the more dreadful, for it speaks of the lonest time of the night I-it is the voice of the old-fashioned, coffin-like clock, in the corner of the hall below-stairs, as it slowly and sonorously strikes-oNE I- TWO ! This is indeed the very "witching hour of night," for at midnight many people are yet astir; but at two o'clock the stillness of the world is like the stillness of a vault. Then almost to a minute, two hours after midnight, rang out that terrific shriek, that had not yet ceased to vi- brate through her ear, and brain, and heart I All was again silent as the tomb. Yet Alice shook as with an ague fit, and the cold sweat of mortal terror -broke out upon her forehead. In one moment that seemed an eternity all the fearful features of her position started up before- her. A foung, slight, timid girl, alone after midnight in an old Louse in a fissure of the mountains.

Quickly striking a light, she hurried from the room out   into the bleak passage-way, down the windy staircase, and through the cheerless lower hall into the parlor. So far all was yet dark and still-the feeble rays of her own taper making the darkness more "visible," the faint echo of her own footsteps making the silence more ap- parent. She paused an instant in the parlor, which remained so exactly as it had been left, looked so quiet, wore such an aspect of domestic peace, that she could imagine no unholy disturbance'near, and was almost persuaded to believe her alarm to have been a mere nightmare dream. She opened the connecting door between the parlor and Mr. Horne's chamber, and there  I!

Bursting from the room, she rushed out into the night, waking all the mountain echoes with her terrific screams. In five minutes the farm laborers were aroused, and in seven they were on the scene of action. The party Jcon- sisted of Mr. Hayhurst, the steward, and all the servants, men and women. They hurried into the chamber of the tragedy, and then ensued a scene that baffles all attempts at description. Old servants knelt over their dead master, mourning and weeping with despair. Women screamed in terror. Some of the elder women wished to raise the murdered man and lay him upon his bed, but Mr. Hayhurst, assuming the direction of affairs, forbade them to move him or to meddle with any thing in the room until the arrival of the coroner. Then the steward proceeded to send a mounted messen- ger to rouse and fetch Dr. Horne; another to Llyndell to request the presence of Colonel North; a third to Bleak- ton to summon the coroner, and a fourth to the village inn to bring Mr. Mostyn, if, perchance, he should not as yet have started on his journey. So far the course of Hayhurst was as judicious as it possibly could be. Each summons sent forth was quickly complied with, and the parties arrived as promptly as time and distance would permit them to do.       ; First came Colonel North, who reached the scene' at about four o'clock; a few moments after him  Gerald Mostyn, pale and horror-stricken at what had occurred; then arrived Dr. Horne, who, appeared overwhelmed with sorrow and indignation; and last of all the coroner, with a number of men from the village, whom he had summoned to act as jurymen. Then, a few minutes- after sunrise, the jury was empan ,    THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY.      123 neled and the investigation began. The premises were carefully examined and the witnesses summoned. First -Alice Owen was called; but she was not in the room, nor in the house, nor in the steward's cottage, nor in any of the laborer's huts, nor anywhere about the prem- ises, where she was long and vainly sought. While the messengers were in quest of her, other wit- nesses were examined. Gerald Mostyn was called, who testified to leaving the deceased, in his usual state, quietly and comfortably in bed at ten o'clock the previous night; the only other person to his knowledge in the house at that time being Alice Owen. Mr. Mostyn further deposed that having left a valuable document behind in the house, and having missed the paper on his arrival at Bleakton, he was hastening back to recover it when he was met by the messenger with the terri- Zfe news of the murder. The next witness was Dr. Horne, who testified to no fact of importance. He had, at four o'clock the day previous, left the deceased in his usual poor health, and in company with his grandson, Mr. Mostyn, and his ward Miss Owen. The third witness was the overseer, Mr. Hayhurst, who deposed that soon after two o'clock in the morning, he had been roused from sleep by a violent knocking at his door, accompanied by the most appalling shrieks; that he had started up and opened the door, when in rushed Alice Owen in a state bordering on distraction I that he gathered, rather from her terrified looks and frantic exclamations than from any connected story, that her guardian had been assassinated in his chamber; that, immediately, accom- panied by the farm laborers, who had also been aroused by her shrieks, and who came hurrying up, he hastened to the -house, where he found the deceased lying murdered, the. window open, and all the things in the same state in which  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7861-00000053"/> 124    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. afterwards the coroner also found them; that he had lost no time in summoning the proper persons, Mr. Hayhurst was the last person examined; for the others were incapable of giving evidence, and the only other witness, Alice Owen, could not be found. So after another hour passed in sifting the testimony and examining the mute evidence of the still life in the chamber, the jury made up their verdict: "Hugh Horne was murdered by a person or persons un- known."  And as it was then ten o'clock, the coroner and his jury dispersed in: quest of breakfast to their several homes. Gerald Mostyn, as heir-at-law, remained at the house and took the direction of affairs., At his invitation, Dr. Horne stayed to assist him. Even Colonel North, forget- ting his former antagonism, or remembering that Mr. Mostyn was possibly now the heir of millions, kindly offered his services, which -Gerald, for Constance's sake, frankly accepted. But before noon that daysthe news of the murder was widely spread, and the whole community thrilled as with one heart at the perusal of the tale I Late in the afternoon Alice Owen was found wandering in the woods in a  state of fever and delirium. She had rambled far from home, and was picked up in the neighbor- hood of the parsonage, where Mrs. Osborne, with a sisterly kindness, took her in and nursed her. On the fourth day from that of his death, the funeral of Hugh Horne took place.   It was attended by a larger concourse of people than had ever assembled in that part within the memory of man. They were drawn together by the unprecedented interest of the occasion. After the funeral, upon the asseveration of Dr. Horne and Mr. Sprole, the Bleakton lawyer, that a will had been made in favor of :the former, the alleged instrument was   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY.      125: everywhere sought, but in vain. No will of any descrip- tion was to be found. And after considerable delay, Gerald Mostyn entered as heir-at-law into his possessions. Not wishing to alienate his patrimonial estate of Radnor's Ruin, he warned the tenant, Dr. Horne, that at the close ,of his term of lease he should be required to give up the premises. But at the same time Gerald Mostyn acted with characteristic magna- nimity, and gave his cousin a deed of Horne's Hole, with the farm attached. Besides this gift, Mr. Mostyn would have settled a com- fortable independence upon Alice Owen, who, by the death of her guardian, was left quite destitute. But the orphan girl, without making the slightest ac- knowledgment of the kindness of that intention, and even with deep horror, absolutely refused to accept the least assistance from him. Every one who knew of this event thought her manner of refusing aid from him, to say the least of it, ungracious; but they attributed it to nervous excitement, and excused her upon account of her-recent illness, while Alice-shuddered and kept her own counsel. But Mr. Gerald Ross Mostyn was now an eminent char- acter. As a rising statesman, a wealthy capitalist, and a landed aristocrat, he, was considered a desirable match even for Miss Constance Wynne, and before his return to London he was invited to dinner by her proud uncle. Then again, he met his beloved, but with subdued joy, for he felt that while all was brightly changed for them,- at what an awful price had been purcesed their p s-ent happiness  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7861-00000054"/> CH APTER XIII.

Mrs. Hemans. SiNcE the mysterious murder of the miser, twelve months had passed away, and yet not the slightest clue had been discovered to the perpetrators of that heinous crime. Gerald Mostyn, in default of the existence of a will, re- mained in quiet possession of his grandfather's estate. Doctor Horne, whose lease had not yet expired, con- tinued to reside at Radnor's Ruin, to practice his pro- fession, and " win golden opinions from all sorts of people." But what was most strange, his lovely young wife, from the day of the miser's dreadful death, had fallen into the profoundest state of despondency, that so affected her health as to make the constant attendance of an intelligent nurse absolutely necessary to her safety. Alice Owen, having resolved, rather than lead a life of idleness and dependence, to earn her bread by any honest occupation, however humble, willingly accepted the situa- tion as attendant upon the invalid lady, and now resided at Radnor's Ruin. Gerald Mostyn had grown in favor with earth and heaven. His position as the most eminent of the rising young statesmen of the day was universally acknowledged; his rank as one of the most important members of the landed and moneyed aristocracy of the state was fully established; but " sweeter still than this, than that, than (126)   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.       127 all," to him-his relation as the accepted lover, and affi- anced husband of Constance Wynne, was openly re- cognized. Christmas approached, at which holy and happy season the marriage was appointed to be solemnized. Gerald Mostyn was at this time fulfilling the duties of his official station in London; but he was expected to arrive at Llyndell on Christmas-eve, the day fixed for the wedding. It was arranged that the bridal pair should spend one month in a short wedding-tour upon the Continent, and that afterwards they should return to London, where the official duties of the bridegroom would require his presence, and where apartments were to be pre-engaged at one of the best hotels. Great were the preparations in progress at Llyndell for the marriage of the heiress of that house. "Ah--ex- claimed the gentleman who was my own informant in many of these particulars--"Ah -half the world of Wales knew what was going on there that week!" Gerald Mostyn and Constance Wynne would both havd willingly waived all this ostentation, but Mrs. Horton would haven a grand wedding, and as the question of " display or no display," was under the circumstances a matter of com- paratively little importance, they did not think proper to oppose the will of the old lady. Constance, accompanied by her grandmother, her uncle, and one of her. cousins, went to town to select a proper trousseau. There Mrs. Horton was most lavish, as well of, her own means as of those of her grand-daughter Constance. She purchased and pressed upon her acceptance the most costly dresses, shawls, laces, and jewels, that were to be found in London. These were duly packed and despatched to Llyndell. A fashionable milliner and mantua-maker, and a French cook and confectioner, were also engaged to  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7861-00000055"/> 128    THE  GIPSY'S ProPHECY, go down thither, to officiate in their several capacities. The mission to the city thus well accomplished, Mrs. Horton and her party returned home. And the remaining week preceding the marriage was one of unprecedented business and bustle. In an upper room a company of dressmakers and plain seamstresses, worked under the direction of the city milliner. In the kitchen and pantry a squad of scullions toiled in the service of the French cook and confectioner. Nor were Mrs. Hor- ton and her fair grand-daughters any less busily engaged. Their taste and skill governed all the arrangements. Even Colonel North's services were called into requisition to write about half a hundred cards of invitation, which were scattered not only among all the visiting acquaintances of the family throughout the country and the adjoining shires, but also distributed to distant friends and relatives residing in London; Brighton, and Bath. As many of these guests were expected to remain over night, chambers were pre- pared for-their accommodation. And as this was an occa- sion ofoccasions, you may judge, reader, that the heavy- Marseilles counterpanes, with bureau covers to match, and porcelain toilette services, and the finest embroidered lace bed and window curtains, were all paraded to adorn the guest-chambers. As the important day approached, the weather became very fine. Christmas-eve was a delightful winter day, clear and cold with a crisp frost; the ground was covered with snow, lightly frozen, and affording good traveling, and therefore promising a large number of guests, even from a distance. And, in fact, as early as nine o'clock in the morning carriages full of company began to arrive.  At this hour the younger ladies were all invisible, being closeted with the milliners in the room adjoining the bride's   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        129 chamber, engaged in putting the finishing touches to their costume. But Mrs. Horton was in the. drawing-room below-stairs to receive her guests. And her woman Evans was in waiting to attend them to their several chambers. The elegantly furnished breakfast-room was not as yet thrown open. Mr. Mostyn and his friend Mr. Brent were expected-to' meet the bride at ten o'clock, when the marriage ceremony was to be solemnized at the parish church, and to be followed by a breakfast at Llyodell. The two younger Misses Horton were to be the attend- ants of the bride; and Mr. Brent and Dr. Heath were to be those of the bridegroom. The bishop of the diocese, who was on a visit to Christ Church Parsonage, for the purpose of confirming the younger members of the church, was to perform the marriage ceremony. Colonel North was to give away the bride. At ten o'clock all was ready. The spacious drawing- rooms, superbly furnished, and beautifully adorned, were filled to everflowing with a distinguished company. The hall was crowded with attendants; and the lawn around the house covered with coaches, gigs, and saddle-horses. In her chamber, the bride sat and mused. To please Mrs. Horton, Constance Wynne's dress was the most mag- nificenit costume ever seen in that part of the country. It was in fact an imported bridal dress that the old lady had found in thecity. It cost a small fortune, but that cir- camstance was only an additional recommendation in the eyes of Mrs. Horton. It was an ample robe of rich white velvet, with a deep border of orange flowers wrought in seed pearls; a light wreath of the same pattern and mate- rial ran around the short sleeves and low neck- of the cor- sage ; a bunch of the same flowerss similarly formed, adorned the stomacher; deep falls of fine point lace half  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7861-00000056"/> M30)   TH1E  GIPSY'S- PROPHEOY. ;failed the rounded arms and curved bosom; a bracelet and necklace of diamonds encircled her well-turned wrists and throat-; a wreath of orange-blossoms, formed of the rich- est oriental pearls, and gemmed with the dew of finer dia- monds, crowned her queenly brow and raven hair. The most delicate gloves and slippers completed her costume. And like a transparent mist tempering the sunshine, over all the resplendent form there floated a superb vail of Va- lenciennes lace. Thus -magnifieently arrayed, Constance Wynne sat alone, waiting and musing-herl noble brow expanded "and ra- diant, her clear gray eyes dilated and darkened, her pale cheeks softly -flushed, her full lips glowing, her whole fine countenance eloquent with the enthusiasm of a profound and earnest joy! Oh I her thoughts were not engaged with the outward splendor of her own position, dazzling as indeed it was; but with the deep and heart-felt happiness, which, by the side of Gerald Mostyn, future years must bring lIer--aye, must! despite the proverbial'vicissitudes of human lifel It was not probable, scarcely possible, that adverse change should come to them; but if it should.-why let it come-l If only her husband, her husband were- left her, her happi- ness was beyond the ingenuity of man, the malice of Satan, or the inconstancy of fortune to disturb I In the blessed- ness of being united for life to him, all other favors or dis- favors of fortune seemed swallowed up-so that, had it been necessary, rather than have parted with Gerald Mostyn, she would have joyfully chosen to share with him the deep- est obscurity, the severest toil, and the utmost privation, even-for the whole of their naturals lives ;--aye I and had eternity pains and trials for the good, with him she would have -shared them also.

So Constance Wynne, with soul overflowing with love and gratitude to God, sat and mused, until the sudden opening of the door and the fluttering entrance of her two  bridemaids, who had just put the finishing touches to their own rich toilets, and now appeared in full dress of white satin, blond lace, pearl necklaces, and wreaths of half-blown white roses. "Constance, are you ready?  Are you ready, Con- stance?" they simultaneously inquired. "Quite," replied the bride, in a low voice and with a soft, unconscious smile. "Well, it wants just five minutes to seven I Mr. Mostyn arrived nearly an hour ago, and was immediately shown/to his chamber, where, I suppose, he has by this time changed his traveling dress for his wedding suit," said Miss Violet. "And, Constance, he has brought down his first grooms-. man, a Mr. Brent, of the Temple, one of the finest-looking men I ever beheld. You see I was peeping through the window-blinds, and saw; him when he arrived with Mr. Mostyn. And as I am first bridemaid, you may be sure I intend to set my cap for him,' said Miss May. "Dr. Heath is to be my cavalier-has he arrived, do you know, Miss Sentinel?" asked Violet. "Why, of course, he has I Everybody has arrived 1 It is a perfect squeeze down-stairs I Evans tells me -that Colonel North has as lmuch as he can do to keep a way clear through the halls, and a space open for the passage of the bridal train.

Violet ran and opened it to admit Lily, who came to ask if the bride and her attendants were ready to descend. ' Ready? Yes, and ' almost waiting."' "Then, madam," said Lily, with a mock courtesy to her cousin, "the bridegroom and his friends are ready to at- tend you to church." And Constance, with "a smile on her lip," and a prayer in her heart, left her maiden bower, and followed by her bridemaids, descended the stairs. Waiting in the hall below was a group of gentlemen, consisting of Mr. Mostyn, conspicuous above them all by his commanding stature and really kingly countenance; Dr. Heath, whose intellectual and melancholy face was lighted up by unusual admiration; Mr e Brent, who ap- peared quite as fine-looking a person as Miss May had described him to be; and, finally, Colonel North, who, re- membering that the Londoner was a stranger, brought him forward immediately and- presented him in turn to the ladies. One glance of involuntary admiration this gentleman cast upon the bride, and then, bowing profoundly, gave his arm to Miss May Horton, and led her to the carriage. Dr. Heath, with a cordial salutation to the' whole party, drew the gloved fingers of Miss Lily over his broad-cloth sleeve, and followed the first couple. Then Constance and Gerald met I and for a single instant spoke together. They had not seen each other for months, and now but a few syllables could be uttered in the few moments afforded while they were passing from the foot of the stairs to the door of the hall. But these few words were freighted with their hearts' deep love. "I My Constance I my adored bride 1" he exclaimed, in a   THE   GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        1838 voice subdued but thrilling with impassioned earnestness, as he pressed and drew her hand within his arm, "my worshipped one! my queen I are you not? are you not?" "I am your wife, happier in that dear name than I could be in any title, were titles for me!" she answered, in ,a tone deeply vibrating with a love too pure, profound, and passionate for dissembling. "My own, own wife!" "For life,2and death, and eternity i" They had now come up-with their attendants, where the whole party separated and entered their several carriages. CHAPTER XIV. All things that we ordained festival, Turn from their office to black funeral: Our instruments to melancholy bells; Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;  Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change; Our bridal flowers to deck a buried corpse:. And all things change them to the contrary.-Shakespeare. THEY reached the. church, which was already filled with an expectant congregation. Amid a general murmur of admiration, the bridal cortege entered, passing in pairs through the narrow    passage opened for them through the:crowd, and took their station, forming a semi-circle in the cleared space before the bishb)p, who, book in hand, stood ready to officiate. And now, while every pair of eyes -in the church were fixed and strained upon the wedding crescent, the bishop opened the book, and, amid a profound silence, by some strange fatality commenced reading-oh, direful omenil- the service for the burial of the dead? t'  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7861-00000058"/> 184'-   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. But at the same instant that the solemn words fell upon: the ears of the bridal pair, thrilling their bosoms with strange prophetic dread, and before the sound could. reach the senses of more distant hearers, he had, with prompt presence of mind, corrected his mistake, and while the giggling bridemaids were hiding their mirth behind their fans or pocket handkerchiefs, he fairly launched into the marriage ritual. The solemn adjuration was made, the prayers offered, the questions proposed, and the vows registered. Colonel North; as by previous arrangement, gave away the bride, and Gerald Mostyn placed upon her finger the binding ring, the symbol of eternity; then the exhortation was pro- nounced, the benediction given, and Gerald and Constance were declared, in the sight of earth and Heaven, man and wife! Friends crowded around to kiss the bride and shake hands with the bridegroom; so- many friends, so many congratulations were there, that it was full fifteen minutes before the newly-married pair were permitted to enter their carriage and return to Llyndell to breakfast. Then the bridal party, Constance leaning on the arm of Mr: Brent, and Miss Horton on that of Mr. Mostyn, and Miss May ois Dr. Heath's, led the way to the breakfast- room. The table, luxurious with edibles, elegant in arrange- meiit, and dazzling with plite, had taxed the utmost skill, taste, ind iresources of the FPiici eoniifectioner and his assistants, and was, of course, iuite a triumph of his art.  The company, quite ready to appreciate its many excel- lences, githered around the board. Some, indeed, seemed spll-b6und beside it. Temples and pagodas, Christian and heaibtfii, cornucopias and caskets, boats and bouquets in candy, in jelly, and in fruits, were demolished and con,   T 1E  G PSY P'S PROPHE   Y.

Champagne left long-necked bottles, to become real pain in the heads of short-necked old gentlemen; nuts ahd jests were cracked; wine anid healths were drunk; speeches and fools were made; the feast was prolonged. Finally, the bride's health was proposed, and after the toast was duly honored, she retired to change her bridal costume for her traveling dress. itnperceived by the company, who were still at the height of their enjoyment, Gerald Mostyn quietly withdrew fromn the room to the library, where he found Mr. Osborne araiting him, and where he was soon joined by Colonel North, Doctor Marauldy, and the bishop. Very gladly would Mr. Mostyn have avoided this last wine-drinking, and speech-making; but custom was despotic, and he was obliged to yield. The wine was poured, the glasses filled and raised, the toast-  "Health, happiness, and long life to Mr. and Mrs. Gerald Mostyn!" Given and honored. And then the bridegroom was permitted to bow and re tire to change his dress. They had just reached the foot- of the stairs, when a loend ringing of the hall-bell troused not only them, but all within the house. A servant near at hand opened the door to see who the   .  applicant might be. An officer was standing without, who immediately strode into the hall, "as one having authority," and inquired- "Is Mr. Gerald Mostyn within?" "In course he is, sir," answered David. "Let him knobw that there is a person here .who wisthes' to see him."  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7861-00000059"/> 136    THE   GIP SYS PROPHECY. "Yes, sir; but, but I beg your pardon, sir, he can't be seen-he's jest been gettin' married, sir," "My errand will admit of no delay. You must let your master know." "But, sir, I assure you, he was jest a going to go--" "Fellow I It is a matter of life and death. Go fetch your master immediately. I must see him." "Well, sir; if you must, I s'pose you must; but who shall I say asks for him, sir?"    "Tell him- an officer." "Yes, sir," said the man, hurrying off to inform his master. But Mr. Mostyn, who had overheard this conversation, now hastened forward, and recognizing an old acquaintance in the sheriff of the county, exclaimed cheerfully, and with- out the least suspicion of his errand- "Why Harrison, how do you do?" ",I am well, I thank you, Mr. Mostyn. How are you?" " ery well," returned Gerald, cordially.- "You have business with me, my servant said."          a "Yes, sir," replied the sheriff, hesitatingly, as if very reluctant to make known his errand. "By the way, it must be very important business that has brought you here at this crisis," said Gerald Mostyn, seriously. "Sir, it is very important," replied the sheriff, gravely. "Then let us know what it is, sir!" "Mr. Mostyn, it is not only a very important, but a very painful business," continued the officer, solemnly. By this time, Mr. Osborne, Colonel North, and several others, had come up. "Is the business of such a nature as to demand a private interview?" inquired Gerald. "No, sir; but its nature is very, very painml."   * *   Y                  THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        -187 "Then, in the name of reason, sir, get it over as quickly as possible," exclaimed Gerald, growing anxious. "Mr. Mostyn, I am forced to the performance of a most obnoxious duty." "Well, for heaven's sake, do it, man 1" "Then, Gerald Mostyn, you are my prisonert" said the sheriff, letting his hand fall upon the shoulder of the bride- groom. "Your prisoner!" exclaimed the latter, in amazement. "Prisoner!" echoed all who heard the word. "Yes, sir--yes, gentlemen ; I very much regret to be the bearer of a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Gerald Mostyn." "Warrant" - "Arrest!" "Gerald Mostyn! l" simultaneously exclaimed Mr. Osborne, Colonel North, and the bishop, who had now joined the party. "But, good heaven! upon what charge V? inquired Colonel North. "Upon a charge that will doubtless prove unfounded, sir,?' replied the sheriff, politely. "But what the demon is it, then?" "Gerald Mostyn is arrested upon the charge of having twelve months since assassinated his aged relative,-Hugh Horne." "Murder?" questioned Colonel North, in a low,- deep, stern voice. "Parricidel!" muttered the bishop, turning pale with horror. "Gerald Mostyn "1 exclaimed Mr. Osborne, in indignant incredulity. As for the accused, after the first involuntary start of astonishment, he stood pale, calm, and motionless as a statue. "It is certainly a monstrous charge, from which, doubt-  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7861-00000060"/> ples, Mr. Mostyn's ininocence will come forth as gold from the furnace," said the sheriff, conciliatingly; "but in the mean time, gentlemen, you must see the necessity of my performing my duty."  "Good Heaven, this affair will become known to our guests! Osborne, good friend, pray close the doors of the drawing-rooms, while I send these lounging rascals about their business,"- said Colonel North, in a low and confidential tone, as he stepped quickly from the scene of action, and sent four or five loitering men-servants from the hall through the back door. Mr. Osborne had complied with the request that had been made him. But it was too late  Already the rumor that the bridegroom, Gerald Mostyn, was arrested upon the charge of murder, was spreading in fearful whispers, and eliciting low, horror-fraught exclamations through the company in the saloon. Colonel North and Mr. Osborne, unconscious of this, returned to the spot where they had left Mr. Mos- tyn, the bishop and the sheriff. "What is to be done now?" inquired Mr. Osborne. "Gentlemen, I regret to say that Mr. Gerald Mostyn will have to go with me." "You cannot mean it?"' "Unfortunately yes, sir; I have a couple of bailiffs with a carriage and horses waiting without to take him away." "But, for Heaven's sake, tell us, then, upon ,what ground -upon whose accusation-has this warrant been issued." "Sir, I cannot inform you. All I know is, that about two hours since, I was summoned to the house, of Mr. Judspn, who put that warrant into y hapdsg, wlth direc- tions to serve it immediately,t Itok it, procured a carriage and horses, and the assistance of two officers, and came di. rectly hither. And now, gentlemn,; I hope that no obhta   THE  GIPSY's   PROPHECY.      139 ele will be thrown in the way of my performance of this duty." "Sir, I am ready to attend you?, said Gerald Nostyn, now speaking for the first time since his arrest, and with complete self-possession. The sheriff bowed. - It is what I expected of you, Mr. Mostyn," he said. "But, Mr. Harrison," said Colonel ,JSorth, speaking in a low and troubled tone, "cannot the:investigation take place here? cannot you remain here with your prisoner until it does? We will give you a room." "I grieve to say that I cannot, sir. The charge, you will recollect, is a capital one, which makes the custody of the accused a grave responsibility." "But where, then, do you intend to take Mr. Mostyn for the present?" inquired the colonel, in a whisper. "To the county jail-there is no other place," replied the sheriff, in the same key. "When will the examination take place?:' "I presume to-morrow, sir, at noon. And now, gentle- men, I trust you will excuse me. Mr. Mostyn, we must take the road." "I am ready, sir," replied the prisoner. The sheriff then stepped to the door, and beckoned the driver of the carriage to draw up. Gerald Mostyn took his cloak from the friendly hands of Mr. Osborne, who had gone to fetch it, and who now assisted him to put it on, took his hat and glovesin .his hands, and stood waiting to enter the carriage. But just then the doors of the saloon were suddenly thrown open, and the excited crowd of guests, unable any longer to bear suspense, came pouring out into the hall, where they found their worst fears realized-Gerald Mos- tyn actually, upon the charge of murder, in custody of the sheriff. s   &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7861-00000061"/> "O    THE  GIPSY'S   PROPHECY.

It will be remembered that when she quietly withdrew from the breakfast-room, Mrs. Osborne and Mrs. Horton met her in the hall, where the old lady took the. newiy- married maiden to her-aged bosom, prayed God to bless her in the union with the husband of her choice, pressed a kiss upon her brow, and bade her good-bye. Mrs. Osborne then conducted Constance down the hall, to the last door on the left-hand side, where they found Lily Horton and the matronly waiting-woman, Evans, in attendance. Evans, with a  low courtesy, opened the door, and they all entered her chamber.   THE  GIPSY'S   PBOPHECY.      141 It was a beautiful room, corresponding to that of Mrs. Horton, which was just across the hall. All the exquisite taste and affectionate care of the girls had been lavished upon its arrangement. The walls were covered with a pearl-white paper, the floor with a carpet having a pretty pattern of roses upon a white ground, the tall windows, the elegant toilet table, the luxurious arm-chair, the com- fortable lounge, the superb tent bedstead, were all draped en suite with hangings of embroidered lace, lined with rose-colored silk, and the richest of those rich Marseilles quilts and toilet-covers were in place. The mirror was half vailed wizh fine lace, festooned back with clusters of red roses; upon the table before it were set in order .the many delicate elegancies of the toilet-curious and :os9fy flacons filled with exquisite perfumes, rare and prie'S -: boxes made of precious metals, woods, and shells, and in- the midst of all, a beautiful pin-cushion, the handiwork of a : Lily, made of white velvet, embroidered and fringed with seed pearls. Ottoman and footstools covered en suite with white lace over rose-colored chambrey, and strewed about at convenient intervals. A bright coal fire in the polished steel grate, tempered by a rose-colored transparent screen that stood before it, radiated a genial warmth through the chamber.  Lastly, from the centre of the ceiling, hung a chandelier of silver plate and crystal glass, that at night, under a rose-colored shade, diffused" a soft glow over the whole scene.  As the bride entered this pretty room, her zealous at-, tendants hastened to wait upon her; Lily drew forward the easy chair in which she seated herself; Evans placed the ottoman under her feet; Mrs. Osborne lifted the vail and the wreath from her brow; and so they proceeded to relieve her of her ornaments, Constance submitting as a matter of etiquette.  When they had put away her splendid wedding-dress,  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7861-00000062"/> 1BM   *THE  GI-PSY'S PROPHROYwi   . and. vail, and wreath, and jewels, and put on- her a rich traveling-dress of gray cashmere, and placed .her bonnet on her bhe d, Mrs. Osborne and Lily Horton embraced and kissed her;' her nurse Evans lifted her hand to her lips, and bursting into tears, prayed God that her dear young lady's married life might be as happy as her maiden life had been good; and so they all withdrew, leaving Con- stance to compose herself before her departure. She remained seated in the easy chair, before the toilet table, where they had left her to herself and her own thoughts-thoughts as pure, as sweet, and as holy as ever graced chamber or chapel-as ever filled the bosom of saint on earth or angel in heaven. For with her heart overflowing with love; and gratitude, and praise, she sat and mused, and in musing, prayed-prayed that in the great blessedness of her own highly favored lot, she might ever remember to aid, comfort, and bless, so far as she should have power, and they have need, all those whose earthly fate was less happy than her own; that amid the high distinctions which awaited her, no less from her own exalted position than from the rising celebrity of her dis- tinguished husband, she might remain very meek and grateful-remembering "Who" had made her "to differ," and offering upon the altar of her heart an unceasing ovation of thanksgiving to him;--also that, above all earthly considerations, and only next to being a faithful hand-maiden of the Lord, she might be a true wife to her adored husband; that the profound devotion which now inspired her heart, making her feel as if her own will were completely submerged in his, might be made her permanent disposition towards him; that neither pride, nor temper, nor coldness, nor any other form of selfishness, might ever ' enter into her bosom, or alloy the love she bore him; that she might be found quite worthy of him, and equal to all   TTHE  GIPSYS   PROPHECY.      14 his requirements-wife, friend, companion, counsellor, com- oforter, servant, if need were--all in one. So Const ance Wynne-nay, Constance Moatyn-sat and mused while the moments glided by. The sound of the revelry, in soft murmurs, occasionally met her ear. The footsteps of passers in the'hall sometimes arrested her attention. At last the commanding 'step of one which she would have recognized amid ten thousand other steps, made her heart bound, her cheek flush, and her breath stop, as she listened, but without approaching her door he passed up- stairs, and she breathed freely, smiled softly to herself, and sank back into her chair. A few minutes passed and then the same well-known step came lightly down the stairs. And while she held her breath and listened-smiling, blushing, waiting--the hall-door bell was loudly rung. "A messenger for some one of the guests," was the silent interpretation of Constance. She heard the door opened, and the subdued sound of voices, but paid little attention, for half in hope and half in dread, she was listening to catch again the sound of those beloved footsteps that had paused somewhere in the hall. There was an increasing though still a half-suppressed ex- citement in the passage-way. "Some one is departing,? she thought. She listened longer, still for that one footstep which came not back. There way f ap ever augmenting commotion without, the sound of many, people hurrying to aend fro and eagerly conversing, though still in subdued tones. "The compapy is-breaking up," she said to herself. But the confusion was extending. Many persons hurried down the hall. The door of Mrs. HortonWs chamber, im- mediately opposite to her own, was thrown open, and some one was borne in thither.  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7861-00000063"/> -144:   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. "A lady has fainted," concluded Constance, with an im. pulse to rush out to the relief of the supposed sufferer, which was only checked by the sudden recollection that the swooning woman, whomsoever she might be, had every sort of attention she could possibly require. All this while the guests were heard departing. At length the excitement began gradually to subside. At last all was silent. Still Constance, reclining in her easy-chair, with her half-veiled eyes and soft smile, mused and listened. Why came not back that footstep? Ah i who should tell her? The clock struck five. Constance started at the sound. "So late I How exceedingly strange that he should be still-absent i" she thought.  Just then there came a rap at the door. it was not his rap--instinct told her that at once. So, with surprise, she answered-- - "Come in." Mrs. Osborne, pallid, trembling, troubled, opened the door, and entered. "In the name of Heaven, what is the matter?" exclaimed Constance, alarmed at her appearance. "Oh, Constance, Constance, my dear l" cried the lady approaching and sinking into the nearest chair. Constance arose, pale but self-possessed, saying, in a firm, calm, steady tone-  - a Some misfortune has occurred; tell me at once what is its nature."

"Oh, Constance, Constance i prepare yourself prepare yourself!" "Heaven I WILL you tell me, or shall I have to rush out to seek for information?" exclaimed the bride, starting forward tort rds the door. Mrs. Osborne sprung up and intercepted her, saying, as she forced her to resume her seat-  - "Constance, sit down. I will tell you every thing. Only compose yourself-be a woman." "Then, on your life-on your soul-do not keep me an instant longer on the rack I Speak--oh, speak I Gerald! what has happened to him?" "Oh; my child I Gerald Mostyn has been arrested." "ARRESTED I!' echoed Constance, in even more wonder than terror, for her worst fear, that of his death, was re- lieved; " arrested, did you say?" "Yes, yes."  "Arrested I good Heaven I But upon what possible pretext? He was not in debt.' "-Oh, my dear I my dear I he was not arrested for debt." "For what, then? Mrs. Osborne, you agonize me."

"Then, Constance, since you are so resolved, there is another thing that I must inform you of. Your grand- mother is very ill." "My grandmother ill " responded Constance, in the tone of one who, having received the heaviest blow that could possibly fall upon her, was rendered comparatively insensible to all others. "Yes, my dear, she swooned away upon hearing of Mr. Mostyn's arrest, and was taken-immediately to bed." "Let me go and see her," said the bride, laying off her bonnet, and leaving the room. Mrs. Osborne, hoping that the state in which she should find the old lady would be an inducement sufficient to detain her at home, followed her across the hall into the chamber of Mrs. Horton. They found the room darkened, and the patient sleeping quietly upon her bed, with Dr. Horne watching on one side, and the three girls-their festive garments changed  for plain wrappers--sitting on the other.         i To Constance's eager inquiries, Dr. Horne answered that the patient was out of immediate danger, and would doubt- less so improve during her quiet sleep as to be much better on awakening.

Constance, with the help of her waiting-woman, hastily completed her preparations to depart. "Good-by, Mrs. Osborne. I leave you to explain my absence to any inquirers." 'When will you be back, Constance?" "I know not. When God wills." "Oh, that Colonel North were here!" said the minister's wife to herself, as she saw Constance enter her carriage and drive off.

It was during this solitary night ride through the thick forest and the dismal mountain gorges, that the astrologer's fell prediction, now in part so strangely fulfilled, first re- curred to her mind, adding its own superstitious gloom and terror to her real sorrows. But blaming herself for. this credulity, and summoning her Christian faith, she mentally exclaimed-- "God reigns, and I appeal from the Egyptian's fatal prophecy to His omnipotent love and wisdom." 9  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7861-00000066"/> CHAPTER XVI. And where is he, that tower of strength, Whose fate with hers for life was joined? How beats his heart, once honor's throne, How high has soared his daring mind? Thomas Dunn English. W3 mist glance back for a moment to Gerald Mostyn. Upon entering the close carriage provided to convey him to the county prison, at the recommendation of the sheriff, he seated himself upon the right-hand back cushion; Mr. Harrison took the place beside him; facing them on the front seat sat the two constables.  The doors were fastened, the word given, and the carriage drove on. The sheriff would have entered into some consoling conversation with the prisoner, but that gentleman de- clined the discussion of his own affairs, and they relapsed into taciturnity. Respect for Mr. Mostyn restrained the officers from conversing upon irrelevant subjects, and the consequence was that for hours the drive proceeded in perfect silence The thoughts of Gerald were meanwhile occupied with' the, incomprehensible strangeness of his present position, But an hour ago, honored as a Christian gentleman, an   I accomplished scholar, and a distinguished statesman, and blessed as the happy bridegroom of the loveliest lady in the land, and now a guarded prisoner in the hands of the sheriff, upon the confounding charge of murder I It was   inconceivable. In all the fabled vicissitudes of human life,  he had heard of. nothing like this. 'He felt as one under the influence of fever, from which he vainly endeavored to clear his brain, or of mania, from which he istruggled to es- (150)   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        161 cape, or nightmare, from which he strove to awake.' It actually required a strong effort of the will to gather the scattered faculties of his astonished mind, and concentrate them upon this amazing event. Upon what possible pre- text could he have been charged with this most unnatural crime? He reviewed all the circumstances of his relations with his deceased grandfather, and of his last visit to Horne's Hole, without finding any thing to explain, or give a clue to, or throw the least light upon, the subject of his accusation. The sheriff, as'it had been seen, could tell him nothing. It remained, then,- to wait patiently for the pre- liminary examination before the magistrate, which was to take place the ensuing day. But the bitterest part of the reflections that followed, was the conjecture as to what would be the effect of the news of his arrest upon Constance, his adored bride, who had so fondly and so fully loved and trusted him, and upon his thousands of friends who had so esteemed and honored him. Would they still give him their confidence and -re, spect? Would she still yield him her love and faith? In the midst of all this the astrologer's prediction re- curred to his memory; but its partial fulfillment was re- garded as a mere coincidence, and this part of the subject was dismissed by his practical good sense. While these thoughts revolved in his mind, the carriage entered the village of Gwyn, and stopped before the prison. The bailiffs alighted. The sheriff followed, and invited his prisoner to come out. Mr. Mostyn, aroused from his reverie, descended and stood upon the flag stones.  It was now quite dark.              ,; They were in the midst of a quiet, silent, murky village street. No creature, except themselves, was stirring. No light, except through the chink of closed shutters, gleamed in the whole town. Before them stood the prison, a moderate-sized square  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7861-00000067"/> 162    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. stone building, enclosed by a stone wall in a circumscribed yard, in which was also the small two-storied brick house occupied by the jailer. Here, also, all Was dark and silent: The sheriff's officer rapped long ands:loudly at the gate before he succeeded in rousing up the jailer; who at last put his head out of an upper window, and asked- "What the deuce is the matter? What do you want?" "It is the sheriff with a prisoner," answered a consta- ble. "Oh, aye I I'll be down in a minute," and the head, or rather the voice, for the head could not be seen in the darkness, disappeared from the window. And in a few minutes the gaoler, attended by a turnkey, came out to the gate, unfastened the strong locks, took down the heavy bars, and admitted the party. Then, after the sheriff had spoken apart to the gaoler, explaining to him the name and standing of the accused, together with the crime with which he stood charged, and demanding in his behalf a considerate and respectful treatment, he took that official up to his charge and introduced him- "Mr. Wardour, the governor of the prison, Mr. Mostyn." "Can't say ' I am glad to see you, sir,' nor do I suppose you are ' very happy to make my acquaintance,I few people are; howsoever, as the quality say to their visitors, ' we'll do all that 'we can to make your stay with us as agreeable as possible,' " said the jailer, very gravely, even sympa- thetically, and without the least pretension to a jest. Mr. Mostyn bowed without replying. "Go on, Turner," said the warden to the turnkey, who, with a lantern, preceded the party to the main entrance of the prison. When the heavy, iron-bound door was unlocked and! thrown open, they entered a long and gloomy corridor, opened the first side-door on the right, and went into the warden's office, where a little preliminary business was   THE  GIPSY'-S; PROPHEOY.      158 transacted, after which the sheriff took leave of his charge, and with the constables left the jail. "Now, sir, if you please," said the jailer politely, ri- sing, "I will show you to your room." Mr. Mostyn, with a grave inclination of the head, arose and followed him. And attended by the turnkey, with a lantern and a bunch of great keys, they passed up a flight of stone steps and reached an upper passage corresponding exactly to the one below, and flanked like that on each-side, with rows of narrow cells. Turning on his course, the warden led his charge up the passage until they reached the farthest door on the right-hand side front. Turning a key, he admitted him into a small apartment, six feet by nine, having a single grated window in front, a small cot bedstead, a chair, and a stove. '  "I put you in this room because it is one of the plea- santest in the establishment-that is, if any of them are pleasant, which I suppose the lodgers seldom think they' are, sir," said the warden, offering the single chair to his prisoner, and conducting himself quite with the air of a landlord receiving a guest. "Anyways," he continued, " this room is clean and dry; o and is in front of the building, with a southern aspect, where the sun looks in all day long, and the window looks out upon the village street." ' I thank you," said Mr. Mostyn. "Would you like a fire, sir,or perhaps you would rather lie down at once?" inquired the warden, with the same landlord-like empressement. "I shall be obliged to you for a fire, lights, writing. materials, and also a small stand. I shall not lie down." "Certainly, sir, they shall be brought immediately. Turner-do you see to the fire, and I'll attend to the other things." The fire was soon kindled, and p little stand was brought ,   &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7861-00000068"/> 154    THE  GIPSY S  PROPHECY. in, upon which was placed a lighted lamp, pens, ink, and paper. "Now, then, sir, is there any thing else we can do for you?" asked the jailer, politely. "No, I thank you, Mr. Wardour." "Ahem I Sir!" Mr. Mostyn looked up. "I can feel for a gentleman in your circumstances. But, sir, if you would just consider yourself in a tavern like, and call me 'landlord,' and Tom Turner here ' waiter,' it might seem to go better likel to a gentleman of your fine feel.- ings." Mr. Mostyn stared in surprise. Up to this time he had been too deeply absorbed in his private thoughts to notice the personal appearance of the oddity who had him in custody; but now he gazed with curiosity, upon a little, short, fat man, of about fifty years of age, with a round, rosy, good-natured face, kind blue eyes, and scanty light hair, curling around an open forehead-a man who, had ht been really A landlord, would have been full of lively good-fellowship, but whose position as warden of the jail, and whose sympathy with the unhappy prisoners, had -quite sobered down to habitual gravity. He wore a suit of brown clothes of a Quakerish simplicity. Seeing that Gerald looked at him without replying, he resumed- "Now do, sir, for if you only would, you have- no idea how much cheerfuller it would seem to be. Turner, too, would a great deal rather be called waiter, wouldn't you now, Turner?' he continued, appealing to the turnkey. "In course, sir," answered the function'ay. Gerald now glanced at the last speaker. Turner was a complete contrast to his master, being a young man, with a tall, spare, and slightly stooping figure, a protruding head, a thin face, shaded with a quantity of Jank red hair, and an expression of countenance at once   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.       156 keen, grave, and compassionate-a look that he had con- tracted by continually pitying the prisoners, and prying into their affairs. While answering his master, he bowed with intense re- spect to Mr. Mostyn. "There now, you see, Turner would like it' better, too, sir," exclaimed the warden, triumphantly. At any other time Mr. Mostyn must have smiled at the quaintness of the idea presented to him; but now his heart was too heavily oppressed, and he answered sorrowfully- "I really thank you, but I would rather call persons and things by their proper names." "And I think, to, sir,?' put in Turner, who had been bending one of his keenest regards upon the prisoner, "that the gentleman would rayther be left to himself." "Aye I the boy is more thoughtful than I am-always is. Well, well, have your own way, Mr. Mostyn. We are at your orders-Tom Turner and me. Don't mind my just turning the key of your door, it's 'the rules of the house,' you know. You find the rules pasted up in many a tavern." And so saying, the warden towed himself out; then in an instant he bowed himself in again, saying- "Excuse me, sir, but what would you like for break- fast?" ,i Any thing--any thing, my good friend; it really does not matter." But if you would be good enough just to express a preference, sir." "Well, well, a cup of coffee."  "And any thing else nice that the mistress can prepare," suggested Tom Turner, in a low tone, nudging the elbow of his chief. "Always thoughtful-always thoughtful, Turner."' "Well, sir, we will do all we possibly can for your comfort." And with a very deferential bow, the jailer comfort."

He wrote on for some time, filling page after page with the outpourings of his spirit, until, warned by the dim red burying of his . lamp, he looked up, and saw that day had dawned. Christmas-day; but what a Christmas-day for him I He arose, extinguished the light, and opened, the little window to admit the fresh morning air.    - Through the grating he looked out across the country to the distant hills whose summits were white with ssnw, and flushed with salmon color on the eastern sides om the coming sun.        .          - Then his eyes sunk down upon the village street beneath his window, which was beginning to be astir with early pedestrians and country wagons. Just across from the prison was the village hotel, whose upper rooms were on a level with his cell. On the right of the hotel was the village post-office, and on the left a physician's office, bearing the sign, DR. HEATH. Gerald Mosty* gazed upon the scene, as seeing it not. His thoughts were far away. "Constance I Constance I how breaks this day to her? How fares she notw? Who will comfort her?" were the perpetually recurring questions of his mind. While thus he sorrowfully gazed and mused, the sound of wheels arrested his attention-because they were not those of the heavy, springless, noisy, farm-wagons, that so often rattled and rebounded past, but of the smoothly re- volving ones of the comfortable family coach; looking down, he saw a close carriage of dark green, drawn by a   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.       157 pair of fine, thorough-bred chesnut horses. Recognizing this equipage as belonging to Lyndell, and murmuring the name of"Colonel North," he was about to retire from the window, when the carriage drew up at the gate, and before the coachman could leave his seat, the door flew open and Constance alighted. Though this was earlier than the hour, for opening, she apparently found no difficulty in gaining admittance, for in a few moments he heard steps approaching along the corridor, and in another instant his door was unlocked and Constance in his cell and in his arms. Tom Turner, who let her in, had closed the door and retired. For a few moments he held her clasped to his bosom iv silence, while she wept upon-his shoulder; and then- ' "Constance I my own, own Constance I how I thank you for this 1" he said, straining her to his heart; -"Thank me? Oh, why? It was my blessed privilege to come to you," she exclaimed, in a voice thrilling with emotion, as she lifted her head from his shoulder, and met his look of passionate love. "But, dear wife I sweet wife " he murmured, softly smoothing back the dark waving tresses from her white brow, " h6w pale you are I You cannot have slept at all!" "Oh I did you think I could, and you--here?" "And to come to me so early this morning, you must have traveled through the darkest Ifours of the night." "I did I I did I Ah I did you think I could do other- wise?-but that was nothing-nothing I Now I am with you, thank God!" she said, fervently, taking her handker- chief from her pocket and wiping the tears from her eyes.

And this charge against you is so very unreasonable, so exceedingly preposterous-nay, indeed, if it were not for the awful nature of the crime, I should say so supremely ridiculous-that it will not bear a moment's calm investigation. Gerald might have told her that; irrational as the accusa. tion really was, unsupported as it might prove, and, speedily discharged as probably he should be, yet the stigma of the charge must rest upon him forever, or until the real criminal should be discovered. Hearing footsteps approaching, he strained her once more to his bosom, pressed an impassioned kiss upon her lips, and released her from his close embrace. Then placing her in the only chair, he stood beside her, with his hand resting upon the little stand, and waiting for the new-comer. It was Tom. Turner again, who softly rapped, and being bidden to come in, stealthily turned the key and deferen- tially entered. He came to bring hot and cold water and clean towels, and to announce that Mr. Mostyn's breakfast was ready. Then he quickly disappeared again. But by the time Mr. Mostyn had refreshed his face and hands, he returned, bearing a good breakfast for two. He sat it upon the little stand, darted out of the cell, and brought a second chair. Then begging of Mr. Mostyn to rap on the table if he should need any thing, the good creature withdrew; and remained outside the door. The newly-married pair drew up to the stand and simul- taneously raised their eyes to each other's face; the same thought was in the minds of both- "How little did we think our Christmas breakfast would be served in the cell of the county prison." But as they gazed upon each other, their eyes softened and glowed with the mutual thought--   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        159 "But we sit down to partake of it together." In truth, there was but little appetite between them; yet, each drank some coffee and ate a small morsel of bread; and then Mr. Mostyn summoned Tom Turner to take away the service. That honest officer entered, replenished the fire, cleared the stand, and retired, leaving the ,pair to- gether in the cell, where they remained conversing until ten o'clock, when the warden entered to inform the pri- soner that the sheriff had arrived to attend him to the ma- gistrate's office. "My dearest love, where shall I dispose you?" inquired Mr. Mostyn, as he arose and awaited the entrance of the sheriff. "Dispose me? On your arm; by your side; I cannot leave you, Gerald," replied Constance, rising, and putting her hand in his. "My own dearest Constance, how I thank you; but this must not'be, love I A magistrate's office is no place for a delicate woman." "And this is no time, God knoweth, for fantastic deli- cacy 1" exclaimed Constance, hurriedly , then, in a slower tone and with deeper feeling, she added--"A wife's place is beside her husband in his trouble, wherever he may be I I would remain with you through all, until you are well over this trial.

She opened her lips to speak again, and then paused,- and looked Silently and tenderly in his face a moment, be- fore saying-  "Ah I do not tell me sol Remember, I am bound to obey you now--a sweet, sweet bondage, that I love to feel, to which I delight to yield; only do not comnmand me now away from your side, for if you do, I shall be obliged to go, and that would deeply, deeply pain my heart!" s  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7861-00000071"/> 160    THE  GIPSY'S' PROPHEOY. "It is for your own sake, dearest Constance, that I ,would have you leave me now." "Then, for my own sake, let me go with you 1" pleaded Constance. "But, dear love, you do not know what you ask I The curious crowd that gathers around such a place, on such an occasion, would stare you out of countenance." "I will lower my vail I They shall not see your wife's face--Gerald, you will let me go?" she prayed, leaning on his arm, looking up into his face-" dear 'husband, it is the first favor I have asked of you since bur marriage. You cannot refuse it!" No, he could not; her soft, appealing gaze, her pleading tones, her argument, were irresistible. "Be it so, my generous love-be it so," he said, drawing her to his bosom in an earnest embrace. Two minutes afterwards the sheriff appeared. He bowed politely to Mr. Mostyn and his wife, and inquired if the former was ready. Being answered in the affirmative, he led the way from the cell, down the long corridor and the stone stairs, through the lower hall, and so out of the prison and the front yard into the street, that they crossed to get into the magis- trate's office, which occupied one of the lower rooms in the' hotel opposite, and before which a large crowd was collected. They made their way more easily than might have been expected through this mass, which separated, leaving a path, that they might have a better iew of the accused, and of the lady that hung upon his arm. Was she, too, implicated? they asked each other. Mr. Mostyn's eyes roved calmly over the crowd on either side, and many were the impudent glances that fell beneath his clear gaze. Constance gathered her vail closely over her face.  And so the party entered the magistrate's office.

Among the persons present were the witnesse who had been examined at the coroner's inquest. Besides- these were Mr. Osborne and Colonel North, who met and shook hands with the accused, and who also looked very much surprised on beholding his bride by his side. "I trust that this mistake of your arrest will be soon rectified, sir," said the colonel to Mr. Mostyn. I trust so, sir. And I must thank you for your pre- sence here upon this occasion," replied Gerald. "Sir, I shall stand by a gentleman who has so recently become connected with our family, until I see better cause than now appears for -abandoning him," replied the colo- nel, with grave dignity. Mr. Mostyn bowed with stately courtesy. ," But, sir," continued tWe colonel, "I confess I am a little surprised and pained at seeing my niece herej This is certainly no place'for a lady. Permit me to advise that she may retire. I can attend her from this to a private parlor in the hotel." "Mrs. Mostyn, sir, will do her own pleasure in the matter," replied Gerald.  "Constance, my dear, take my arm; let me lead you from this," said Colonel North, going to the side of his niece. "' Uncle, I am here by my-own will, and with my hus- band's consent. I thank you for your kind offer, but I prefer to remain," replied the lady gently, but firmly. ,Headstrong woman!" ejaculated the colonel, under his breath. And before another word could be said, the justice, who had all this time been busily writing, laid aside his pen, raised his eyes, and signified his intention to open the examination.

A SEAT was given the accused immediately in front of the magistrate's table. And amid a profound and almost breathless attention, the investigation commenced. First the witnesses who had given testimony before the coroner's inquest were examined. Their evidence on the former occasion being already known to the reader, need not be repeated here in detail.            f It amounted to nearly this: that the old man had given a Christmas dinner and supper; that he had retired to, bed, at nine o'clock, in his usual precarious state of health-; that the last persons who saw him living were Gerald Mostyn, who left his bedside and the house at ten o'clock, and Alice Owen, who, a fewminutes later, visited his chamber, sung him to sleep, and left him in deep repose; that, about two hours after midnight, the overseer and the farm servants were arouised fromi thei4r sleep by the shrieks of Alice Owen, from whose frantic exclamrations rather than from any con- nected account, they learned that something horrible had occurred at the house, which, when they reached, they found to be the assassination of their master; that in the confusion Alice Owen disappeared, nor could be found to give testimony; that, when at last discovered, she was in a state of high fever, rapidly progressing to delirium, which held her life and reason in abeyance for many weeks; -but (162) ,                         .   TH1E  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        165 that, in the opinion (y these witnesses, Alice Owen, if summoned, could make some startling, disclosures. Here the magistrate directed his clerk to fill up a sub- poena, and place it in the hands of an officer, to be served upon Alice Owen. And a question immediately arose as- to where that young person could be found. A voice answered that she was an inmate of the family of Dr. Horne. Then Dr. Horne arose, and said that the young lady had left his house the preceding day in a very mysterious manner, and had not since been heardsfrom. The magistrate, upon hearing this, directed the officer to take the subpoena, and institute a search, deciding, in the mean time, that the examination should proceed. Up to t this time, no testimony in the slightest dege reflecting upon the prisoner, or justifying his arrest, had Been elicited. And people had begun to shrug their shoulders, when- "Let John Hounsloe take the stand," said the clerk. In answer to this summons, a little, wiry, dark-skinned man, clad in a shooting jacket, and known throughout the country as an old sportsman, came forward. Every one crowded a little nearer to hear what this new witness, who had not appeared at the' coroner's inquest, and who seemed, to all intents and'purposes, entirely dis- connected with the circumstances of the murder, could pos- sibly have to say about it. The oath having been administered in the usual form, the clerk said-       - r  "Be so good, Hounsloe, as to state to the justice all that you know in regard to the case in hand." The witness scratched his ear, looked disturbed, and seemed very unwilling to give evidence. But having been again requested to proceed, he said-  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7861-00000073"/> 164    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. "I don't know nothing whatsomedever about it, moreo'n what I told his worship when*I fetched in the clothes."'  "Very well, state that."  Gerald Mostyn fixed his eyes upon the witness in sur- prise, curiosity, and vague expectation. Every one else pressed closer, and listened eagerly to hear more. The witness looked around upon the group crowding behind him, cleared his throat, fixed his eyes upon the magistrate, and commenced. "You see, yer worship, I were out yesterday 'long o' my dogs a-shooting in the piece o' woods in Hornets Hole, just 'atween the point wldere the two mountains join. I'd been out 'most all the best part o' the day, and got perty well lo'den down with game, so, as it got towards the arternoon, I began to, think 'bout home, which lay on the tother side o' the mount'in, and it to cross. So I was Jest a gwine to whistle the dogs to heel, when I saw 'em jest 'bout a coupi o' hundred yards afore me, right at the footeo the ridge, p'nting something as was in a crevice o' the rocks, or the side o' the ridge, I couldn't tell which. But thinking as it was a hanimal o' some sort, I jest cocked my gun, and creeped along till I got near enough-when I sez- "' What's it, dogs--good dogs?' sez I. "But they only whined, and guv out sharp, suddint barks, and pawed away like among the dried furze and cedar bushes and broken rocks that crowded all the foot, of the range, and choked up the hole where they had p'nted. "Thinks I, it's a somethinkd So I drew the charge out'n my gun, and p a+iC a heavier load, and watched and waited, keeping m eyes fixed upon the hole, and my gun and my ears both cocked. But I couldn't hear nor see no hivin' creature 'cept 'twas the dogs, as still continered to bark and scrape away like thunder. And presently down come a piece o' broken rock, and then another, Then the foremost dog, the setter as H bought from Dr. Horne-   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.       16 pushed himself about half way in the hole, and began to drag at something from within. "' It's no hanimal, nor nothink else alive,' sez I, and I creeped nigh, when the dog, with a great shake of his head and a strong pull, dragged out a stout bundle, half undid in pulling it through. So I took the thing from the dog and unrolled it, and seen how it was a good suit o' cloth clothes, jest as dry and nice as if it wer jest put away there. Well, I was jest debatin' in my mind whether ] should take it home, or whether I hadn't better put it back, in case the real owner had put it there for safe keeping, when I noticed the velvet cuff of the right sleeve all splotched with thick, gummy stains, like dark red wax: The right breast o' the coat, and the right leg of the pants, jest above the knee, was splotched with the same stuff, jest as if it had been spurted on 'em. It kinder made my heart stand still, though I wa'n't quite sure what it was. "-In a sorter awe, I begun to s'arch the pockets, and out'n the inside breast pocket I drawed a packet, as when I unrolled, it didn't take any better scholar nor myself to see, was old dockerments o' some sort, which,not being college bred, I couldn't make head nor tail on. S'arching the other pockets, I found a razor, rusted and /tuck together, and a white pocket han'kercher, gummed together with the same dark stuff, and havin' of a name on it as I couldn't make out, and last of all, a little book with ivory leaves and tortoise-shell covers, writ all over with so'thing as much: Greek and Latin to me as the pocket han'kercher and the dockerment was.   "Then all of a suddint, while lookin' at the things- 'specially at the stained clothes, the razor, and the-docker- ment-I memorized the murder of Mr. Hugh Horne, and" the talk o' the missing will, and thinking this had somed' thing to do with that, I rolled up the things together :ag i, and called the dogs, and sot off fast as I could' go throhS l ' 10  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7861-00000074"/> 1664   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY. the woods and 'cross the country to this plac'e, where I tuk the things right up to constable McNab, who examined themi, and-constable McNab will tell 'you the rest," con- !luded the witness, Nothing could exceed the keenness of the interest with which this testimony was received. Gerald Mostyn listened with the closest attention, and when the discovery of the clothing was described, an acute observer might-have detected in his-firmly set face a slight change of color. Constance, who had been accommodated with a,seat to the left of, and a little behind her husband, listened with her face pale with anxiety, and her lips compressed with resolution. Colonel North, who stood on the left of his niece, with folded arms and frowning brow, heard without a comment. But Mr. Osborne, who stood on the right of Con- stance, and im mediately behind the accused, stooped and whispered--        - "That is- all very interesting and important, doubtless. But for all it has to do with the guilt or innocence of our friend here, it might as well be an investigation into the origip of the Chinese religion." Before any one could-answer, the  magistrate spoke, addressing the witness-- "You may sit down, Hounsloe, unless the accused wishes to cross-examine you," he added, turning towards Mr. Mostyn, who was his own counsel. That gentleman bowed with grave courtesy, saying-- 'For the present, no, sir." "He is right," whispered Mr. Osborne to- the colonel. '" 4,Masterly inactivity' is a mighty power in some cases. Thismaybe a conspiracy, in which he is wise to give!.them s0 to speak) rope enough to hang themselves." ' Or ;himself," muttered the colonel between his teejth.   T-HEV  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.       16 ^ !"Let Alexander McNab take the stand," said the clerk.          In response to the summons, a tall, raw-boned, red- headed man, of Caledonian origin, advanced. Being duly sworn, he said- Your worship, at seven o'clock last evening, the last. witness came to my house, bringing the bundle of clothes which he has just described, rand of the finding of which he gave the same account to me that he did to your worship. We then examined the clothes and the articles found in the pockets. The clothes we were unable to identify, but the name on the handkerchief, gentlemen, was that of ' G. R. Mostyn.' " "My God!" exclaimed Constance, in a deep, low voice, clasping her hands, and growing deadly pale. The accused heard this startling evidence withcalmness. Indeed, only once had he betrayed any emotion, and that was, as I said, on hearing of the discovery of the clothing. The frown darkened upon the countenance of Colonel North. But Mr. Osborne stooped and whispered him- "Tut I that proves nothing; the handkerchief was most likely picked up by the real murderer, and thrust into his pocket." The witness proceeded. a"We next examined the razor, on the handle of which was engraved the single name, 'Mostyn.' Then we looked at the tablets, on the coyer of which was a small silver shield, adorned with a wreath-:of laurel, encircling the in- scription-' Constance to Gerald.' Lastly we unfolded the document, which proved to be the will of Mrx Horne, ex- ecuted in favor of his nephew, Dr. Home, to whom he bequeathed his whole estate.

Gerald Mostyn heard these dreadful disclosures with an i unmoved countenance. And Constance, noble Constance, after the first exclamation of anguish had escaped her lips, placed her hand within her husband's, and sat calm, still, and firm, though pale as parian marble. But it is impossible to describe the consternation with which this terrible testimony was heard by the majority of person's present. They stared in each, other's faces in blank dismay, or astonished inquiry, as if to ask-"Are we awake? Do we dream? Is this real?" The countenance of Colonel North grew dark as doom. He bit his nether lip until the blood started. Only Mr. Osborne stooped and said- "Circumstantial evidence I The nerest circumstantial evidence. I am no lawyer, but it is easy for me to see through this. Of course, the murderer was also a robber, and purloined those effects of Mr. Mostyn found in the pocket of the hidden clothing." At this suggestion the darkened countenance of Colouei North slightly cleared. But the examination was proceed- ing, and their attention was immediately given to that. "Let the articles in question be produced," said the amagistrate. The constable retired a few steps, took a bundle from a bailiff at hand, and laid it upon the table, where, unrolling it, he displayed the blood-stained clothing and the other items described by the two preceding witnesses, who, being recalled, identified them. "Let Dr. Horne take the stand," said the magistrate. Dr. Horne came forward, pale, trembling, tottering, and altogether more agitated than any other person present had yet appeared.   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        169 "Dr. Horne, have you ever seen this suit of clothing before?" "Yes, your worship,"- replied the witness, in faltering tones. ' Tell us, if you please, in whose possession, and upon what occasion you have seen it." "I have seen that suit, sir, but? once-it was then worn by Mr. Gerald Mostyn at the Christmas dinner given by Mr. Hugh Horne upon the day of his death." Awful was the effect of these words upon all present. The panic deepened. Colonel North turned away. Even Mr. Osborne made no comment. Only Mr. Mostyn. re- mained composed, and Constance, dear Constance, pressed' his hand. "You are sure-remembering that you are upon oath -that this is the identical suit of clothing worn by Mr. Mostyn upon the occasion you have stated?" "I am sure of it, sir." "I would ask the witness one question," said Mr. Mos- tyn, now for the first time rising. "Proceed, sir,"' said the magistrate. Gerald Mostyn turned towards the witness, and, endeav- oring to catch his eye, inquired-- "Dr. Horne, will you state whether that occasion to which you referred was the last upon which you saw this suit of clothes?" "Yes," replied the witness, in a voice that grew steadier from effort, "that- was the first," the last, and the only oc- casion upon which I ever sa:wthese garments until I be- held them unrolled upon this table.'-' "Is there any other question you would ask the witness?" inquired the magistrate. "No, sir. I have done with him for the present." "Then you may retire, Dr. Horne." The witness retreated.  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7861-00000076"/> "70    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY, There was a pause of a few minutes, at the end of which, the justice, turning towards the prisoner, said- "Mr. Mostyn, you have heard the testimony against you; what have -you to say in defence V"/ Gerald Mostyn stooped and whispered to his wife- "Courage, dear love." Then pressing her hand, which had all this while re- mained in his own, he relinquished it,' and rising, in a- self collected manner addressed the magistrate- "May it please your worship, my arrest last evening upon the charge of the crime with which I stand accused, filled my mind with the most unqualified astonishment; The whole course of my past life would seem to be a suffi- cient refutation of such a charge, were not the accusation supported: by some strangely pertinent testimony-testi- mony which I shall proceed to rebut by offering a few facts which may serve to throw some light upon the circumstan- tial evidence; and from which also I shall draw, and sub. mit to your worship, some strong inferences." Here-the prisoner paused for a moment, to arrange his thoughts, while the crowd --pressed closely around, gazing upon his face, hanging upon his words. Colonel North walked back to his post near his niece; Mr. Osborne aroused himself from his depression, and both looked and listened with the deepest interest. "To do this,' continued Mr. Mostyn, "I shall be forced to give you, sir, a succinct account of the manner in which my time was passed from the moment I bade adieu to my relative, Mr. Horne, to that when I received the intelli- gence of his death. Upon the night in question, at ten o'clock, I took leate of Mr. EHorne, and went into an ad- joining chamber, which had been appropriated to my use, and Where I changed my evening dress for a traveling suit. In my haste, for it was late, H transferred nothing except my parse and penknife from the-pockets of the former to   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.       171 those of the latter. Having promised to return to Horne'k Hole in a very few days, and not wishing to burthen my- self with a heavy portmanteau, I hung the suit, in the pockets of which I had inadvertently left a set of tablets, \  a handkerchief, and perhaps some other trifles, in the chamber, where I left it for my use, upon the occa- sion of my next visit. Then throwing an ample traveling cloak around me, and taking my hat and gloves, I passed through the parlor, where I took leave of Miss Alice Owen, and departing from the house, mounted the 'horse that awaited me, and rode rapidly as the mountain path would permit, on towards BIeakton." Here, for the second time, the accused paused; an ear- nest thoughtfulness shadowed his brow,- as his eyes lowered for a moment upon the form of the noble girl beside him; and then, lifting his head, he continued- "I confess that, during my ride, as well as during the whole afternoon, and evening preceding it, my mind had been much pre-occupied. Hence it followed that when I had ridden about three hours, I discovered to my dismay that I had left a very important document behind lying upon the mantel-shelf of my chamber. As its recovery was ab- solutely necessary, I turned my horse's head, and was riding back when met by the messenger with the intelligence of the murder of Mr. Horne. It may be easily imagined that the sudden news of this awful event shocked all other ideas from my mind. Putting spurs to my horse, regardless of the dangers of the descent, I dashed down the declivity, and soon reached Horne's Hole, where the bloody corpse of the murdered man met my horror-stricken sight, and confirmed the messenger's story, and where the coroner's inquest soon afterwards met." Here,- for the third time, the prisoner paused for a mo- ment, during which exclamations .of--"An ingenious ex- planation," "Not a satisfactory refutation," "A likely  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7861-00000077"/> 172    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECy. story, indeed," "Wants proof," and so forth, were passed sotto voce among the crowd. "Among the exciting scenes that followed,"continued Mr. Mostyn, "it will be readily believed that I had no time for thoughts of other matters. It was late in the afternoon before i remembered the important document in search of which I had turned back, and which I found just where I had left it. It was days afterwards that I discovered the loss of the dress-suit which I had left in my chamber, and for which, indeed, having put on mourning, I had no use. When I missed .this suit, I naturally supposed that it had been mislaid; but seeing that it could not be found, I came to the conclusion that it had been purloined by one of the servants, or perhaps by some one among the miscellaneous crowd that had filled the house at the time of the coroner's inquest, and afterwards during the funral. And so being deeply occupied with more important affairs, I dismissed that matter from my mind. -Now, however, recently-dis- covered circumstances constrain me to draw another deduc- tion from the theft of the clothing, and to conclude that that suit was stolen, and put on by the murderer, both for the sake of concealing his own identity, and for the purpose of fixing 1te crime upon another. A4 for the presence of the missing will in the pocket of thefcoat, I cannot in any manner account for that circumstance, except upon the by- pothesis that that also'was purloined by the murderer. Your worship, I  have said all that, at present, ave to say upon this subject," concluded the prisoner, as a bow, he resumed his. seat.          L Tlhre was a pause, a hesitation, a reluctance, evident on the part of the magistrate, who at length said- "Mr. Mostyn, ydefence is very plausible; but your explanation wants proof, in lack of which it becomes my painful duty to commit you for trial before the assizes, now in session at this place."   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHEOY.      173 Then turning to his clerk the magitrate gave some directions in a low voice to that functionary, who took up -his pen, and began filling out a blank form. "Fear nothing, dear one, fear nothing; for God is with the guiltless," whispered Gerald Mostyn, pressing the hand of his bride, who, pale as monumental marble, had heard this judgment pronounced. Colonel North and Mr. Osborne, after talking apart for a few minutes, went up to the magistrate, and offered to enter ito a recognisance to any amount that should be re- quired for the appearance of the prisoner at court. But the justice reminded those gentlemen that a prisoner ac- cused of a capital crime, the charge supported by strong evidence, was not bailable. Colonel North and Mr. Osborne, after a little fruitless controversy upon the subject, bowed and fell back a felt paces. The clerk laid the committal before the magistrate, who signed and placed it in the hands of the officer, saying- "Remove the prisoner."   '  Then the sitting was adjourned, and the justice arose. The crowd began to disperse. Colonel North and Mr. Osborne, though, as a matter of form, or perhaps from a sense of propriety, they had offered bail for the prisoner, now that it was refused, seemed indisposed to approach, or in any manner notice, Gerald Mostyn, to whom no one'ln that crowd, except Constance, spoke one word of sympathy, comfort, or- encouragement  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7861-00000078"/> CHAPTER      XVIII.

"THS way, if you please, sir," said the sheriff,' in a cold voice, addressing his prisoner, and preparing to leave the magistrate's office. Mr. Mostyn pressed the hand of his wife, and still re- taining it in his own, arose and looked around for some proper friend to whose care he might confide her. He naturally first thought of Colonel North; but that gentle-, man, with a gloomy and abstracted air, was talking to the magistrate. He next looked towards Mr. Osborne; but   " the minister, with a moody and repellant brow, turned away. Dr. Heath was cold and distant in manner, Dr. Horne freezing in his looks. Therekwas not a man in that assembly who did not believe the prisoner guilty. Gerald Mostyn, with a keen pang, saw this, and turned his glance down upon the noble girl beside him, whom he had so. unconsciously involved in his own misfortunes. She divined his thoughts and feelings, and although so deadly pale, she arose and passed her arm within his, and with a steady voice, said-- "Permit me to go with you, dearest Gerald, and to re- main as long as the authorities will allow. " But before Mr. Mostyn could reply, Colonel North left the side of the magistrate, hastened forward, and seized the hand of Constance, saying-  (174)     THE  GIPSY'S PROPHE'CY.       175 "My dear niece, you must come with me at once. I wish to have some conversation with you." "With Mr. Mostyn's consent, if you please, uncle," said the lady, withdrawing her hand, and lifting to her husband's face a glance full of devotion, which, perhaps, under happier circumstances, she .m ight not have thought it necessary to display. "Be it so, then," replied the colonel, ironically. "Mr. Mostyn, with your permission, I would have a few moments' private conversation with my niece." "Certainly, sir," replied Gerald, with dignity. Then stooping to his wife, he said, gently: "Constance, dear one, go with him. You will know where to find me an} hour hence." And placing her hand in that of the colonel; Mr. Mostyn turned to folloW the sheriff. Colonel-North led Constance through the back door of the office, (which, it will be remembered, was one of the first- floor front rooms of the village hotel,) and along- a narrow passage, to a private parlor. Placing a chair for her accommodation, he seated himself, and looking her straight in the face, said- - "Constance Wynae   " ":Constance Mostyn, if you please, uncle," amended the lady, with much dignity.

I go to my husband ;" and with a slight- bow, she went on. ,  He sprang up and intercepted her, seized her wrist, and forced her back to her seat., She was too proud to strug- gle; but just as soon as Ahe sat down, she quickly possessed herself of the bell-tassel that hung within her reach, and holding it ti her hand,'said, calmly- "Colonel North, you have; committed a breach'of the peace in using violence towards a woman not subject to your authority. If, therefore, you again venture to use force in preventing me from, leaving this room, and going to comfort my husband, you will constrain me to the very painful necessity of calling ib assistance and giving you in charge." "All the demons in and out of Hades;" exclaimed the old man, in a fainting voice, as he dropped into a chair, overwhelmed with astonisnment at the audacity of Con- stance. And before he recovered his self-possession, the lady quietly arose and .withdrew from the room. Constance vailed herself, crossed the street, entered the prison, and in a few moments was admitted to her hus- -band's cell. Mr. Mostyn was sitting in his little green wooden chair, beside the tiny black walnut stand, engaged in writing. He looked- up, turned, and held out his arms as she advanced and gently dropped upon his bosom, exclaiming in low, deep, impassioned tones--"Thine, thine, thine, thine I Oh I fold me fondly, for I am thine own, own, own I I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee-never, never, never  Oh I I do love thee, and honor thee, and trust thee, more than ever woman did man before!" Closely he pressed her to his bosom, earnestly he an. swered--"My Constance, my beloved bride I what return "  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7861-00000082"/> 2 -   TH E  GIPSY' S    PROPHE C Y. can I make thee for all thy devotion? Oh I since this arrest had to be made, would to God it had been made a day earlier, that so it had not involved thee in my ruin!" "So would not I I God be thanked that since this ar- rest was destined to be made, it was not' made one hour 'earlier, for thus, at least, it leaves me the privilege, the blessed privilege, the indisputable wife's privilege, of remain- ing at your side to share, if not to soothe, your sorrows! Oh I my dear, dear, husband I amid all the bitterness of this bitter hour, how I thank God for this one sweet mercy!l she exclaimed, dropping her head on his breast. "But, Constance, my devoted wife! pause before you decide. Your only earthly safety may be in leaving me- pause and reflect l"' he said, with earnest solem ey. "Pause! as if I could pause I Oh I ' entread e not to leave thee, nor to return from following after thee.' The / Lord so do to me also if aught but death part thee and me!" she .replied in the solemn and beautiful words of the Moabitess. And so through that sad Chistmas-day, that smrrowful first day of their wedded lives, she remained beside him. Towards evening, Mr. Wardour was summoned and re quested to go across the street to the hotel, and try to en gage a chamber and a private parlor for her accommoda tion. He went. But the assizes being in session, and the vil- lage full of people, the hotel was crowded to excess, and neither parlor nor chamber could be obtained. Besides this, there was not a lodging-house in town. Nor was z Constance acquainted with any family in the place with whom she might have taken up a temporary abode. Around great sorrows how many small vexations gather. Gerald and Constance looked at each other in perplexity. The good-hearted jailer came to their aid with a suggestion. "Mrs. Wardour has a neat spare bed"room, which is very   THE   GIPSY'jP PROPHEC1.      f$l heartily at the lady's service, if she will do us the honer to take it," he said. With earnest thanks they accepted the offer, and terms were arranged to the satisfaction of both parties. And thus by having lodging within the prison enclosure, Con- stance enjoyed the extraordinary privilege of remaining in her husband's cell up to the latest hour of retirement. Then, having united in evening prayer, the newly-married and most sorrowful pair separated for the night. Constance, conducted by the turnkey, who waited for her without, went down, and left the prisonSfor the little two- storied house in the same enclosure, that was the jailer's dwelling. 'Here she was met by Mrs Wardour a little, fat, good- natured woman, of forty years of age, who received her with the most respectful kindness, and conducted her up the little narrow stairs to a small bed-chamber, having a single win- dow, curtained with white muslin; a list carpet on the floor; a single bed, covered with white dimity; a toilet- table, draped with white cambric; and lastly, a cheerful little wood-fire burning on a bright red hearth, before which was drawn up an easy-chair and a reading-stand. A fresh night-dress was laid upon the bed for the use of the lady, whose wardrobe was, of course,-understood to be left behind at LlyndeII. The kind-hearted hostess officiated as lady's-maid, and- after undressing her guest, and seeing her in bed, she with- drew, taking the light, and leaving the lady to her much- needed quietness and repose. And thus Constance passed the second night after her marriage. The jailer's little family kept very early hours, so that J about the dawn of day Constance was awakened from her restless sleep by the suppressed stir -of the little household around her. She immediately arose, for there was much to be done which she wished to cmplete before the h  io?

She quickly made her simple toilet-a plain gray silk dress, with white collar and cuffs, and her dark hair plainly parted over her broad forehead, and gathered in a large roll at the nape of her neck--and was ready to partake of her early breakfast. Immediately after the morning meal, she despatched Willie, the son. of the warden, to order her carriage and horses fromn the livery stable where they had been left, as slie wished to send to Llyndell for her own and Mr. Mos- tyn's wardrobes. To her surprise and vexation, the lad returned with the news that her'equipage had, on the pre- ceding day, been withdrawn and sent home by Colonel North. This event was not more embarrassing in itself than indicative of future petty persecutions of the same sort. With some difficulty, Constance at length procured a mes- senger wit' a cart, to carry an order to Llyndell for her own and-  r. Mostyn's luggage. And this business de- spatched, she went to her husband's cell, where she pur- posed to spend the day. During the forenoon Mr. Mostyn made out a brief, which Constance assisted him in transcribing, and copies of which he sent, with retaining fees, to his colleague, Mr. Jones, of London, and/to his friend, Mr. Wright, of Edinburgh, ac- companied by a request that those gentlemen would, if pos- sible, come down to defend him. Late in the evening the cart returned from Llyndell with Mr. Mostyn's trunks and boxes. But instead of Con- stance's luggage, came a note from Colonel North, refusing to send any portion of her personal effects, and command. ing her instant return to Llyndell. Now, Constance, who had determined(.never to disturb the harrassed mind of her husband with her own personal vexations, had his luggage quietly brought into 'the lobby outside of his cell, and, in   THE  GIPSY'S   PROPHECY.      185 regard to her own, kept silence. She knew the imperious temper of her guardian, and knew also that he had no right to detain her personal effects; and these effects, particu- larly her jewels and pocket-money, she needed very much to pay expenses and provide present comforts. She ac- cordingly formed her plan, and waited for the next morn- ing to put it in execution. Mr. Brent, of the Temple, who had been her husband's first groomsman, was now in town, at the hotel, waiting the leisure of his friend- to offerhis services for the defence. Early on the third morning, therefore, Constance addressed a note to this gentleman, requesting, him to see. her at her lodgings., And when he came, she explained her position, and requested him to at- tend her to Llyndell, whither she wished to go and demand her property. Mr. Brent readily consented; and Con- stance, with the approbation of Mr. Mostyn, departed under his escort for Llyndell, where she arrived in the afternoon. But little did the lady anticipate the storm of indigna- tion, invectives, and reproaches, that was to meet, her'there. Her grandmother, who was still ill from the effects of the shock she had received, accused her of bringing her " gray hairs down in sorrow to the grave." - Colonel North ,-r4:t-f proached her with disobedience, imprudence, and im- modesty. And even her young cousins, amid tears of grief and anger, charged her with ruining all their' own pros- pects, by clinging to her "felon" bridegroom. And all, with one accord, gave her to understanc that, in the event of her returning to him, neither aid, comfort, nor counte- nance, was to be hoped frbom her own family, who would thereupon and thenceforward discard and disown her. All this Cohstance bore with great composure, firmness, :ad patience--only, at the end of all, quietly requesting to be ' put in possession of her personal effects. These were for some time refused, until, at the suggestion of Constance,  Mr. Brent interfered, reminding the colClel that, in the  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7861-00000084"/> 186    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. event of his continued refusal, a suit wuld be commenced against him, which would not greatly tend to the elevation of his credit. So, finally, by coolness, patience, and perse-  verance, Constance and her advocate conquered. The ef- fects were given up; and, pursued by the evil prophecies of the proud, worldly, and imperious family, the lady and her escort set out for Gwyn, which they reached at mid- night. Even more than the heavy calamity that hung over her head, did this petty, contemptible, humiliating family warfare distract and depress the mind of the high-spirited girl. She was almost content that the hour was so late when she arrived, that the prison doors were closed, and that a night must intervene before she could present her- self before her husband. It was but a few days to this date, when quite a sensa- tion was created in town by the arrest of Alice Owen, who was discovered in a mountain gipsy's hut, where she was supposed to be hiding from the subpoena. As it was be- lieved that her testimony would be the most important, and as- it was 'feared that she would again elude the vigilance of the officers, and escape, to avoid testifying, she was re- quired to enter into a recognizance with her securities, Drs. Horne and Heath, for her appearance at the present term of assizes, to give evidence in the approaching trial of Gerald Mostyn for the murder of Hugh Horne.- It was on the third morning succeeding the arrest of Alice Owen, that Messrs. Jones and Wright arrived in town, and after a visit to the cell of the prisoner, with Mr. Brent, adjourned to a private parlor in the hotel, where they had- a long consultation, in which it was arranged how  three should conduct the defence.   CHAPTER XIX. The last, the last, the last- Last clasp of failing hands- Last look of fading eyes- Last words of dying lips.-Anon. ON that January morning, the sun arose over a wild winter scene. The snow that had been falling fast for the three preceding days now covered the earth to the depth of two feet. The clouds had all dispersed, and the un- blemished whiteness of the ground, unde the unvailed radiance of the sunshine, was perfectly dazzling. It was the morning of the trial. Mr. Xopstyn arose early, and was soon afterwards joined by his wife. He had dressed himself, with his accustomed careful attention to propriety, in his favorite costume, a suit of clerical black, relieved- by delicate linen; his fine, raven-black hair was parted on the left side, and swept off freely from his broad forehead, now somewhat blanched by anxiety and confinement. An ample black cloth cloak, lined with sable, hung upon his left shoulder, and was partly gathered upon his left arm. In his right hand he held his black beaver hat. Constance wore a black silk dress, and black velvet mantilla and bonnet, and a black lace vail-the darkness of her costume relieved by &amp;adelicate white lace collar and cuffs, and light kid gloves. - Tasteful, becoming, and appropriate as was their costume, it had been assumed by each without an instant's fore-, thought.  They had, Heaven knows, enough of more im- portant business to occupy their minds, and this attention to appearance was a mere mechanical matter of habit.- Yet they were a handsome, stately, imposing couple a:,-  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7861-00000085"/> 188    THE  GIPSY'S PR0OPHECY. they stood together-he holding her hand, gazing in her face, and murmuring, in grave tones- "A fortnight ago to-day, dearest Constance, I arose the happiest man in England--for it was to be our wedding- day--and now   "  "You are required to be the bravest, as you are as- suredly, by one heart at least, the most respected and the best beloved," said Constance, finishing his sentence, with a voice and look of high encouragement. "May th Lord bless you and reward you, my own heroic wife." "May he save us both I And nowwhile we have the opportunity, let us kneel and pray for His presence in the coming trial." In the prison cell, beside the prison cot, they knelt and implored the Father to be with them through the coming day ;-to guard them from all evil, to guide them into all good, to strengthen their weakness, to enlighten theid darkness; to comfort them in affliction, or bless them in joy; to direct them -in all emergencies, and sanetify to them every event; to give them a happy delivery out of all their troubles, and to save them evermore, through His  mercy in the Divine Redeemer. "And now, whatever be the issue of this day, beloved one, we shall :,know that it is all for the best," said, Mr. Mostyn, as they arose from their knees. Approaching steps, and a rap at the cell door, followed by the tirning of the key, announced the arrival of the sheriff, to conduct the prisoner to the court. -On' entering the cell, Mr. larrison bowed very lowly to the :lady, and respectfully intihated his errand to the prisoner.  ":We are ready to attend you, sir," said Mr. Mostyn, drawing the arm of his wife within his own, and gathering up the folds: of his ample cloak.   THE  GIPSY'S   PROPHECY.      189 "But will madam. accompany us?" inquired the sheriff. "It is her desire, sir, if there is no objection." "Oh, assuredly-not."  Preceded by the sheriff, and followed by two constables, Mr. Mostyn, with Constance, deeply vailed and hanging on his arm, left the prison, and passed out into the street. It was of course the first day since his committal that he ha set foot outside the prison enclosure. Severe as the weather had been, impeded as 'the roads were, the village was full of strangers, drawn together by the thrilling interest of the approaching trial; and the village street was crowded with coaches, chaises, gigs, and saddle-horses, and thronged with foot passengers, all making their way towards the court-house. Those were not the days of ambrotypes, cheap wdod cuts, and illustrated newspapers; the faces of the prisoner, his wife, the sheriff, and " all concerned," were not familiar as "' household" forms to every stranger in town; therefore, Mr. and Mrs. Mostyn, with their escort, passed unmolested through the crowd to the court-house, which was situated one' square above the prison, on the same side of thq street.         - The space before the buildings the stairs, the porch, the passage leading to the court-room, and the court-room itself, were densely thronged with an eager and expectant multitude; Here the sheriff, being obliged to exercise his official authority to have a way cleared through the crowd, his identity and that of the prisoner and of his companion became suspected, and a great tumult arose among the excited spectators, anxious to get a view of the party. And it was some time before the constables succeeded in making a way for the prisoner, through the press of people that filled the court-room, to the place appointed for him. During the preliminary forms of the trial, Mr. Mostya  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7861-00000086"/> 2 190    THE -GIPSY'S PROPHECY. remained seated in front of the bench, having his counsel on his right hand, and his wife on his left. He sat with his form erect, his head raised and slightly thrown back, his large cloak falling, from his shoulders, his proud gaze calmly regarding the proceedings of the court, or the per- sons of the spectators. Constance sat still and silent beside him, with her black lace vail dropped before her pale face. On the bench the celebrated Baron Wold presided. The attorney-general was the distinguished John Henry Cole; associated with him in the prosecution Was the no less eminent Peter Cawdow.! Opposed to them  for the defence, were Messrs. Jones, Wright, and Brent, all of them rising young barristers, and two of them since of world-wide fame in the science of jurisprudence. Among the sea of heads around, behind, and on each side of him, the prisoner recognized many friends, acquaint- ances, aridrelatives from the country, and several of his colleagues and companions from London. Some :among them   returned his glance by a bow of friendly recognition, while others looked 'up, down, to the right, or to the left, to avoid meeting his eye. The former -charitably hoped in his innocence, the latter thoroughly believed in his guilt. While Mr. Mostyn was making these observations, the business of the court was progressing. When the prelimi- naries were over, the prisoner was arraigned by the usual formula, and-the indictment-charging Gerald Mostyn of the County of Denbigh, with the wilful and felonious mur- der of Hugh Horne, of the said county, by the cutting of his throat with a razor, on the morning of the 26th of De- cember, 18-, was read. Then the clerk of the court, addressing the prisoner, asked-- "Gerald Mostyn, how say you-are you guilty or not guilty of the- felony with which you are indicted?" '  *   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.       131 Mr. Mostyn, who was standing with his stately form drawn ip to its haughtiest height, his large cloak hanging gracefully from one shoulder, and drawn up on his arm, and his right hand raised, answered calmly, almost scorn- fully- "NOT GUILTY."  "How will you be tried?" "By God and my country," replied the prisoner, with 'dignity, folding his cloak around him, and resuming his seat. The prosecuting attorney, Cole, arose, and opened the indictment. He said:-Incredible as the statement might appear, that a crime of such atrocious nature as that set forth in the indictment they were about to try, could be perpetrated by a man of such distinguished reputation as the prisoner at the bar, yet by the testimony about to be offered, he should place the fact beyond the shadow of a doubt; that this testimony was so clear, so consecutive, so conclusive, that it would need no art in its arrangement, no logic in its presentation, no eloquence in its illustration; that he should offer nothing but the simple, overwhelming, and convicting FAcTs. He then proceeded to make a state- ment of the circumstances that led to the arrest of the prisoner, and with which the reader is too well acquainted to need the repetition here. The prisoner and his devoted wife listened to this indict- ment with undisturbed attention and unshaken firmness. Only Constance, at the most distressing section of the charge, raised her eyes to his Mith a gaze full of unwavering faith and courage. At the close of his speech, the attorney-general pro. ceeded to call the witnesses for the prosecution. It had been his intention to place Alice Owen first upon the stand, as the first discoverer of the murder; but the ex- treme agnation of the poor girl, who sat clothed in- deep  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7861-00000087"/> 192   .THE   GIPSY'S PROPHECY. mourning, closely veiled, and cowering between Mr. Os. borne and Dr. Heath, rendered it expedient to :give her time to recover her composure. And the attorney-general proceeded with the next witness, who was equally well fitted to lead off the prosecution.  Dr. Horne, nephew of the deceased, being duly sworn,l testified that a long estrangement had existed between the prisoner at the bar and the deceased; that the deceased had made a will, in whickhhe had cut off the prisoner with a shilling, and left the whole of his vast property to the witness; that after the funeral of the deceased the will could nowhere be found; and that consequently the prisoner came into the undisputed possession of the patrimonial estate. Being cross-examined, he admitted that there had been a reconciliation between the deceased and the prisoner upon the day preceding the murder, and that the deceased had mentioned his -intention to make a new will in equal favor of the prisoner and the witness-a plan approved by all the three concerned. He farther testified to having left the deceased in his usual health at four o'clock on the afternoon preceding the murder, He was then permitted to sit down. The next witness called was Mrs. Horne, who, pale, trembling, and half fainting, was placed at the stand. She corroborated/her husband's testimony in every particular; and then, in pity of her state, was permitted to, retire with- out cross-examination. The third witness, Hayhurst, the bailiff, or farm mana- ger, late in the employment of the deceased, being sworn, testified to the midnight alarm, the- gathering at the-house, the finding of the body, and the condition of the room. A severe cross-examination failed either to weaken the old facts or to elicit new ones; and so he was suffered to retire. The next two witnesses were  e wife and son of the ,pre. -^  -   *'  '.   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        195 ceding, who corroborated his testimony both in the first statement and the cross-examination. Then Dr. Heath, placed at the stand and sworn, testified' to being summoned to Horne's Hole on the morning of the 26th of December; to the finding of the dead body; the condition of the room and the persons present; and gave a report of the post-mortem examination of the body, and the nature and extent of the wound the cause of the death; and being-cross-examined without other results, was per- mitted to retire. Then Colonel North, being called and duly sworn, testi- fied to the finding of the body; the state of the room; the company present, and was crbss-examined without effect, and suffered to retire. The next witness gave but a repetition of the late evi- ence. Hounsloe, the hunter, was then summoned to take the stand, and being duly sworn, testified to the finding of the blood-stained clothing, the razor, tablets, and other per- sonal effects bearing the name of the prisoner. The constable to whom he had at once :carried the packet cor- roborated his testimony. Dr. Horne, being recalled, identified the garments as those worn by the. prisoner at the Christmas dinner pre- ceding the mtirder. During the examination and cross-examination of the last three witnesses, a pin might have been heard to fall if dropped in that room, sodeep was the silence, so fixed the attention, so intense the interest. -  As pale, as firm, and as motionless as a pair of marble statues, sat the prisoner and his wife-their eyes resting upon each other, or fixed upon the witness or the prosecut- ing attorney. But when the name of Alice Owen was called, and the beautiful girl, clothed in deep mourning, moved slowly  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7861-00000088"/> ^94    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY  /    forward to the stand, and putting aside her vail, stood with downcast eyes, whose long black lashes rested upon color- less cheeks, deeply shadowed by thick clouds of ebon ringlets, the silence deepened, the attention became more fixed, the interest more painful. Being sworn, the maiden was addressed by the attorney-general:- "Witness, look upon the prisoner at the bar." Alice turned, and sent one quick, and quickly-withdrawn, glance at the face of Gerald Mostyn. The blood rushed in torrents, crimsoning her brows, and then retreating, left it pale as marble; a shudder passed through her whole frame; the perspiration burst in cold drops upon her forehead; she tottered, leaned forward upon the railing for'support, and cast an imploring gaze into the face of the judge. Baron Wold did not speak, but his answering look said, plainly- "My child, you cannot help yourself, nor can we help you; you must perform y6ur painful duty"  "A glass of water," said Dr. Heath. A bailiff brought the required refreshment, and the doctor himself pushed forward, and placed it to the lips of the witness, saying, encouragingly-. "My dear Alice, be firm, I entreat you.' She quaffed the water, and returned' the glass. Dr. Heath retreated, and the attorney-general said- "Now, witness, you have looked upon the prisoner at the bar; do you Iknow him?" "I do, sir," answered Alice, in an expiring voice, with- out raising her eyes from the floor. "Tell tl jury, then, all that you know in regard to this crime for which he stands indicted." Alice convulsively clasped her hands, threw up an imr- ploring glance at the bench, but, meeting no mercy there, and being again urged by the attorney-general, she comr mented, in a trembling voice-   3THE  GIPSY'S   'ROPHECY.      195 "On the night of the 25th of December, at ten o'clock, I let out Mr. Gerald Mostyn, who had been dining and spending the evening with the deceased and myself at Horne's Hole." "Did you notice what clothes were worn by the prisoner at the time you let him out?" "He wore the cloak he now wears. I do not know what he wore under that." "Do you know what clothes he had on at the Christmas dinner upon the day in question?" "Yes, sir." "What were they?" "A black cloth dress-coat and trousers, and a black satin vest." "Take this suit in your hands, and examine it well. Is this the same worn by the prisoner at the Christmas din- ner?" inquired the prosecutor, placing, the blood-stained garments before the witness. "Yes, sir, this is the same," replied Alice, after a care- ful examination of the clothing. "Did he wear this suit when he left the house?" "Sir, I could not see what he wore under his cloak when' he left the house." "Have you any reason to suppose he changed his cloth- ing between the hour of retiring to. Mr. H orne's room and that of his leaving the house?" . "No, sir, I have no reason to suppose he did." "Go on, then, with your statement. What happened after the departure of ,the prisoner?" "I shut up the house carffully; then went into Mr. Horne's room, and -fndinding him, wakeful, sat flown beside his bed and sung to him in a low voice, until he went to sleep; then closed up his room, and put a log of wo od on: the fire to keep it burning; then went into the parlor and took another look at the fastenings; and then went up to       ,    $  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7861-00000089"/> 196,   THE   GIPSY'S PROPHECY. my bedroom, which was immediately over that of the deceased. There was no one in the great lonely house but myself and the old man, and he was sound asleep. I could not sleep; the late hour, the loneliness of the scene, the melancholy howling of the wind through the rocks and ravines of the mountains near, and an undefinable feeling of dread, all combined to keep me awake. It was after midnight, for I heard the clock in the lower'hall strike twelve, before I fell into a disturbed sleep. I was aroused by one single, prolonged shriek. I sprang up in an icy chill of terror, and listened; but as all was silent and dark, I could not know whether I had really dreamed or heard that cry. While listening so, I heard a half-smothered struggling and scuffling, if upon the floor of the room beneath mine; then a rise, \ heavy fall, and a groan. Thinking only of the helpless old man-carried forward in spite of excessive terror, I struck a light and hastened down below. By the strong draught through the lower hall, that nearly extinguished my light, I knew that some door or window had been opened. I passed rapidly through the parlor, that I found in the same state in which I had left it, and opened the door connected with Mr. Horne's room  " Here the witness suddenly stopped, shuddered, grew deadly white in the face, sunk in her chair, and dropped her head forward on the railings. The' attorney-general gave her time; but after a few minutes, inquired- "Well, witness, what next? When you opened the door' connecting with Mr. Horne's chamber, what did you see?" She raised her head, shivered, and replied, in cold and hollow tones "Opposite to the door by/which I entered I saw the open window, which nearly extinguished my light, and a man escaping through it  '  f    THE  GIPSY S PROPHECY.- "Did you recognize that man?"' "Yes, sir."  "Who was it?" "It was-the prisoner," said the witness, in a dying voice. Here Gerald-Mostyn and Constance started simultane- o-isly, and fixed their eyes in horror upon the, young girl, whom they could not believe to be otherwise than most. atrociously perjured. But the pale, suffering, and most holy countenance of the poor maiden proved that whatever her pain might be, it could not be that of remorse, . "Well, what then?" inquired the attorney-general. ," I felt something at my feet-looked down, and-;0, Heaven of heavens H saw Mr, Hugh Horne lying doubled up on the floor, with his face and his gray hair in a pool of his blood."     -"  ' "Was he--at the time you first discovered-him lying thus-was he quite dead?" "I thought so when I saw him, sir,) answered Alice, in the same freezing, shuddering tones. " ' Witness I remember that you are upon your oath; do not, therefore, prevaricate. I ask you to state distinctly to the jury whether; when you first discovered Mr. Hugh Horne lying in that position, he was quite dead?" "No, sir, he was not," replied Agnes, with extreme re- luetance. "What did you do?"

Then the sheriff presented himself to conduct the prisoner from the place Mr. Mostyn arose to follow him.    Constance stood up,   r   THE GIPSY'S PROPfHECY.   drew her vail over her face, and slipped her arm within that of her husband. And in perfect silence, and under the battery of an hun- dred pairs of eyes, they passed out of the court-room, down the street, and into the prison. $ It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when the hapless pair found themselves once more left alone in the cell. They sat down together on the side of the cot, her Hand clasped in his, their eyes fixed in dreadful silence on the ground. He was the first to break the dumb spell. "My Constance, what think you of all this?" "Think! What do I think?-that it is an inscrutable mystery-perhaps a successful conspiracy--God knows 1" she ejaculated, convulsively closing her fingers upon the hand that held her own. And-no slightest shade of suspicion of my possible guilt disturbs your mind?" She answered him only by a look. "What, my own dearest? You trust me despite 'the overwhelming evidence?"? Still that eloquent look. "O, Constance, my wife I You confide in me, notwith- standing the testimony of the blood-stained garments, the razor identified as mine, and the last words of the dying man, charging me with his murder?" Yet that most eloquent look!--that look of undying, unwavering, ineffable trust 1 Now may the Lord of Heaven bless you, my wife-my wife-for your faith is my greatest stay in this most bitter hour!" With a gesture of adoring confidence she raised the hand that held hers, andpressed it to her heart. "But, sweet Co'stance, you are, of all this world, the only one who has faith in my innocence," he said, sorrow- fully.  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7861-00000091"/> 200    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. "If it be so, it is because I am the only one who knows you thoroughly, as why should I not? Am I not your second self?-the heart of your heart? "And, soul of my soul I spirit of my spirit 1 life of my life I Yes, you are all these, my own-my own!" he said, gathering her to his bosom. Then, after a few moments, he added "Constance, you have great firmness?" "When you demand it of me-yes, yes I Whatever you require of me I have, or by God's grace, I will acquire I Test my firmness." "Hear me, then, my) Constance," he said, with deep solemnity. "I shall be convicted.," "Without Divine interposition," she reverently replied. "And after conviction I shall be--executed!" "Without' Divine interposition'-yes,'" she repeated. "Constance H-my Constance H-the days of miracles are past." "But not of 'Divine interpositionl ' she reiterated. "Mans extremity is God's opportunity., O, let us appeal to Him."

Notwithstanding the lateness of the hournow near sunset--the inclemency of the weather, and the bad state of the roads, neighboring farmers, who should have been on their way homeward, strangers who should have been comfortably housed in lodgings, and villagers who would have been safer by their own firesides, were gathered into groups at the corners, or loitering before the shop doors, or lingering in front of the court-house or of the hotel, earnestly engaged in the - dis- cussion of the trial. There was but one opinion, a general belief in the prisoner's guilt; and but one expectation, a unanimous prophecy of his impending conviction and cer-   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        201  / tain execution. And true as sad it is to say, that the ma- jority of those present looked forward to beholding all the remaining scenes of the passing reality with: more zest than they could have felt in witnessing the successive acts of some fine tragedy. At ten o'clock the next morning the court met. The room was, if possible, more crowded,' and with a more eager audience than upon the preceding day. A few minutes after ten, the prisoner, accompanied by his wife, washrought in. Mr. Mostyn was placed in the dock, and his wife seated herself immediately below it. As soon as they had sat down, Gerald7 raised his head, and Constance drew aside her vail, and those nearest to them then saw how pale and worn they had become since the previous day. The business of the trial proceeded. Alice Owen had been the last witness examined by the: prosecution. The counsel for the prisoner, reserving his- privilege! of cross- examining this deponent, arose and opened 'the: Cfee. The gentlemen of the jury had heard, he'said, the in- dictment, charging his client with a crime so unnatural, so atrocious, so impossible, that no one looking now upon his face, would, upon any evidence less forcible than that of their own senses, believe him guilty. They had farther heard, he continued, the testimony brought forward to sus- tain that indictment-testimony which, however weighty it might be made to appear by the skill of his learned brother, was, at the very best, but circumstantial evidence, the least to be trusted, the most uncertain, the most decep- tive in the annals of jurisprudence, and lIght as levity it- self when cast in the opposite ,scale with-he would not say the -distinguished position, brilliant talents, and splendid career of his client-but with the irreproachable character of Gerald Mostyn., Here he enlarged upon the many eminent and well-known virtues of the prisoner, and cited  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7861-00000092"/> 202    THE- GIPSY'S   PROPHECY. many well-authenticated instances of his strict integrity, warm benevolence, and prompt generosity, under circuml stances calculated to severely test these shining qualities. Should a chain of merely circumstantial evidence, however strong, have power to ruin a man with the character of sterling honor, disinterested charity, and high magnanimity, universally conceded to his client? Forbid it, justice. Then he animadverted on the nature, history, and tenden- cies of circumstantial evidence in general, and citing several celebrated cases in particular, in which guiltless persons had perished under testimony more convincing, overwhelming, and destructive than any that- had been brought against his client, he instanced the well-known trials of Jennings, Crow, Shaw, and several others, all clearly convicted, and incontinently executed, for crimes committed and after- wards-confessed by others."* These instances of the fatal fallibility of circumstantial evidence were such as had happened to come to our know- ledge, he said, but of how often the innocent had suffered instead of the guilty,-without any event arising in time to save their lives, or afterwards to vindicate their honor, no one buts God knew or could know until the day of the last judgment. It behoved jurors, then, to be very cautious in giving any weight to such evidence, even where the criminating circumstances were left unexplained, as they should not be in the case of his client, for he was about to offer an ex- planation, which, taken conjointly with the high character of Mr. Mostyn, would not only secure an honorable acquittal, butwould compel a triumphant vindication. The jury, he confidently anticipated, would, before leaving their seats, return a verdict in his client's favor. lie then entered upon the elucidation of the opposite testimony. * These cases may be found recorded, under the head of "Circumtaatil Evi- dence," in a book published about twenty years ago, entitled "Celebrated Trials.'   THE  GIPSY'S   PROPHEOY.      208 The prosecutor, he said, had made a great point of the estrangement existing between the prisoner and the de- ceased. He should prove by a most important witness that had been used for the prosecution, that the estrange- ment had ceased, and that the reconciliation had been com- plete. He should call his witnesses, he said, at each point of his statement which he wished them to prove. He then requested that Miss Alice Owen should take the stand, Alice came forward, pale and trembling as before, but being questioned as to the state of feeling between the prisoner and the deceased up to the day of his death, she recovered her spirits, and testified with alacrity to the per- fect reconciliation and warm regard between Mr. Hugh Horne and his grandson, Gerald Mostyn. She was then permitted to retire. Mr. Wright resumed his argument. The learned prose- cutor, he went on, had made, or endeavored to makifc i very salient poiut of the suppositions circumstance that his : client had been opposed to the projected will of the      : deceased. But he should prove -by another witness, who    ? had been called for the prosecution, that not only was his  client entirely concurrent in the plan o? that will, but that after the funeral of the deceased, when the will could no- where be found, as it probably never had had an existence, he-his client-had declared himself bound by its under- stood purposes, and resolved to carry out its intended pro- visions. Fe then summoned Dr SIorne, who, with great appa- rent satisfactic., testified to these facts, and was permitted to retire. The counsel for the defence continued his argument. The finding of the blood-stained garments, tablets, hands kerchief, razor, and other articles, identified as the property of his client, seemed a very strong piece of circumstantial  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7861-00000093"/> aQ4   :-T Ht:E GIPSY' S?ROPH EOC-T. -yidence, but- how very weak before the force of trath. That those garments had been orn, -and those blood- stained-articles handled by the real murderer, no one could -doubt; .but that murderer was not the prisoner at the bar; his client had put off those clothes, and had left them hang- ing-up in his dressing-room, when he left the house at ten o'clock at night. ffiHere he recalled Alice Owen, who testified that the prisoner, upon leaving the old man's chamber before ten o'clock, had gone into his dressing-room, where he had remained quite long enough to have changed his clothes. The advocate went on. Doubtless, he said, that the real murderer, with purpose aforethought to save himself and implicate another in the crime, had stolen into the house-; by the light of the fire had seen the suit of clothes on the wall; had doffed his own and donned them; bad done the dark deed, and then, to clear himselfof all signs Oof guilt,lhad again changed clothes, and had buried the -blood-stained suit where they were afterwards found. There was, he said, a final piece of' evidence to be over- throwni-that of Miss Alice Owen, ins regard to what she supposed she saw and heard upon her discovery of the murder. First, as to what she supposed she saw--a man whom she recognized as Mr. Gerald Mostyn, escaping from the window. Now the fact was that she saw a suit of clothes which she recognized as Mr. Gerald Mostyn's, on the person of a man whom she could'have no possibility of recognizing at all-escaping by the window. The young girl here evinced more fear than she had be- trayed during this second appearance. "Witness, you said that upon entering the chamber of Mr. Horne immediately after the murder, you saw a man hurrying out through the window, and that you -knew him, ,the fugitive, to be-Mr. Gerald Mostvn. Now, be good enough to tell us how you knew him,"   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY.      205: "By his size and his suit of clothes, which was the same Chat Mr. Mostyn wore at the Christmas dinner that day.  "Then you did not see his face?"- "No, sir; his head was entirely/out of the window." "So you see gentlemen of the jury, to what this over- whelming item in the circumstantial evidence dwindles down. The young lady saw-a suit of clothes I I pro- pose, in default of a flesh and blood murderer being found, that the guilty suit of clothes be convicted.

"It was totally dark, then?" "Until I brought the candle it had been so, sir, except for the faint light from the smouldering fire on the hearth of Mr. Mostyn's dressing-room which was adjoining, the  door between being open." "Notice, gentlemen, the struggle with the unknown murderer took place in silence and darkness. Now, wit- ness, what was the age of Mr. Horne?" "Ninety-one, I believe, sir," she said. "Were his sight and hearing good?"  "His sight, sir, 'was almost extinct." "Ah I gentlemen, notice if you please. I repeat-the struggle between Mr. Horne and his unknown murderer took place in utter silence and in partial darkness. Now, under such circumstances, how is it possible that a purblind old man of ninety-one should be able to identify his destroyer? By the faint, low glimmer of the smouldering fire on the hearth of the -adjoining room, he identified the clothes, and was thus led into the same error as that of Miss Owen. This evidence is strong against the clothes, which certainly should be convicted, but proves nothing against my client, whose life, character, and conduct, form an absolute refutation to so preposterous a charge." Here the advocate called in succession a large number of highly respectable witnesses, -among whom were the Reverend Mr. Osborne, Dr, Horne, Dr. Heath, Colonel North, and Mr. Maraudy, some of, whom had known Mr. Gerald' Mostyn from childhood to manhood, and esteemed hilm as a model of integrity in all the relations of life. When the last witness had retired, the advocate reviewed his whole argument-the full reconciliation and the mutual regard existing between the prisoner and the deceased at the time of his death; 'the plans of the one, meeting the fi ll concurrence of the other; the perfect willingnessrof the latter to carry out the purposes of the projected will of the   THE  GIPSY'S PROPH      CY.  207 former; the strong fact of the prisoner having put off the dress suit and left it in his own room when he departed from the house, hours before the death of the deceased; the circumstances of the death-struggle having taken place in perfect silence and darkness, making it impossible for a man, ninety-one years old, two-thirds blind and deaf with age, to identify his murderer; the proverbial fallibility of circumstantial evidence in general, and its especial unre- liabilityas arrayed against the irreproachable character of Gerald Mostyn. The advocate wound up by a logical and eloquent appeal to the reason and the feeling of the jury, and sat down. He was followed by the assistant:cou s for the defence, Mr. Brent, in an ingenious and Closely reasoned argument. And then the defence rested. The attorney-general arose in his place. He summed up the points of the evidence in an overwhelming mass of testimony against the prisoner, and dismissed the whole of the argument for the defence with the half-contemptuous assertion thatits only essential points rested simply upon the word of the prisoner, and wanted proof. e Acute logic, and scathing sarcasm marked his powerful peroration, and he sat down amid a deep and ominous silence. The venerable judge then arose to charge the jury. They had heard, commenced his lordship, the indictment charging the prisoner at the bar with the murder of Hugh Horne, on the night of the twenty-sixth of Dcember; they had heard the- testimony- by which that charge was sup- ported; they would give him their attention while he re- counted the links in the chain of evidence. The judge then in turn reviewed the facts as proved--the rebellious boy- hood and youth of the prisoner; the long estrangement between the latter and the deceased; the very recen reconciliation; the fact that the prisoner, of all men in the world, seemed the most interested that the death qf. tho  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7861-00000095"/> i  :108   .T HE  G I P SY' S PRO?H EC Y. deceased should take place at the time it actually did occur; since by his dying that day intestate, the prisoner, as heir- at-law, would come into immediate possession of his whole ,real and personal estate, while, had he lived twenty-four- hours longer, to execute the will he planned, the prisoner would have inherited but one-half his property. Thus the prisoner was the person most interested in the event of his death taking place just at the time it occurred; thus the party most to be profited by the crime, and the motive for the deed was established in the person of the prisoner. The motive existing, what was the result? On the night of the murder, in the very moment of discovery, was seen escaping from the window of the victim's chamber, a man whom one witness identified upon oath as the prisoner: A few seconds later the lips of the dying man charged with the murder the prisoner at the bar. The clothing found stained with blood was identified by many witnesses as the very suit worn by the prisoner on the day of the murder. These, said .his lordship, were the points of evidence against the prisoner. The jury had also heard, he said, the argument for the defence; they would give their atten- tion while he spoke of its main features. Many highly respectable .persons, he said, had testified to the excellent character of: the prisoner, and. their testimony would have its weight with the jury ;: the defence had given an explana. tion of the circumstance of the finding of the blood-stained garments; an explanation, ^-eh,: resting entirely upon the unsupported statement of the, pisoner, could be of no im- portance;  the defence 4had 5further characterized the evidence of the prosecution as circumstantial; but he would instruct the jury that it was not only circumstantial, but positive.  There-was no evidence known to law, he said, stronger or more positive than that of an eye-witness and the declaration of the dying. The dying words of the :murdered man and'the direct testimony of an eye-witness,   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        209 were in evidence against the prisoner. If, therefore, they believed this evidence, they were to bring in a verdict in accordance with it. The jury would now retire and deliberate upon their verdict. The charge of the venerable judge seemed equivalent to an instruction of the jury to convict the prisoner. His lordship resumed his seat amid an ominous stillness. But how had Gerald Mostyn and his devoted wife heard this terrible charge? Gerald had listened with his fine form erect, his arms folded, his head thrown back, his face pale but firm, his eyes fixed steadily upon the countenance of his judge, save when they turned with unutterable affec- tion to meet the eyes of his wife. Constance had attended with a face as white as a statue's, but as devoted as a martyr's; with bloodless lips compressed, and tearless eyes fixed upon the judge, and ice-cold hands, clasped together on her lap, save when some overwhelming point in the evidence for the prosecution was dwelt upon with" dreadful force, then her eyes would seek her husband's eyes, with such ineffable love and trust, as if she sought with her one woman power of faith to rollback the whole overwhelming weight of evidence against him. Meanwhile, without leaving their places, the jury con- sulted together for a few moments, and then the foreman arose and announced that their verdict was ready. This sudden movement was totally unexpected. The stillness and coldness of death crept over the spectators. All present felt that they) sat under the awful shadow of the scaffold. For one dreadi moment all blood was con- gealed, every breath was suspended, and every heart stopped. The eyes of Constance  sought those of her doomed husband; her fingers clasped his hand; ;er voice whispered-  "There remains God 1"           .  'The judge arose.  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7861-00000096"/> 210    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. "Jurors, look upon the prisoner."' The eyes of the twelve rested upon the pale, firm face of Gerald Mostyn. "Prisoner, look upon the jury." Mr. Mostyn turned an unflinching gaze upon the men who held his fate in their hands. "How say you, gentlemen of the jury--is Gerald Mos- tyn guilty of the felony laid to his charge, or not guilty?" 4 GUILTY 1" responded the foreman. "God liveth l"  The lips that breathed these words were pallid with mortal despair, 'and tremulous with woman's utmost woe I The tones were low, yet through the deep silence that followed the verdict, and filled the court, the words rever- berated with awful power. They were an absolute relief to all over whom the fate of the prisoner hung like the blackest pall. The next sound that broke upon the death-like silence was the voice of the clerk- "Gerald :Mostyn, you have been duly tried and convicted of murder by a jury of your peers. Have you, therefore, any thing to say why the judgment of death should not be pronounced upon you?" The deep voice of the prisoner replied, addressing the judge- "I have nothing to say, your honor, but/what has already been better said by my counsel; nothing that would not uselessly prolong this painful scene, which I entreat, for the sake of all concerned, may be concluded as speedily as possible; nothing, in short, that would not be a mere reiteration of the old, absolute truth of my guiltlessness, against overwhelming evidence of my guilt; nothing, in fine, but to express a hope that God may bring that truth to light."  As Gerald Mostyn spoke, so noble, calm, and self- ,  i .

The judge made a sign to the crier, who arose and pronounced the fearful words-     . "Let there be silence in the court while sentencelof death is pronounced upon the prisoner." And a silence like death followed, for every sob was hushed, every breath suspended, every pulse stopped. "Prisoner, arise and receive the sentence-of the court," were the next terrible words that broke the stillness. Mr. Mostyn arose and stood erect, with his arms folded across his chest, his stately head thrown back, his fine countenance undisturbed in proud serenity, his eyes fixed unflinchingly upon the face of the judge. The venerable judge arose, his reverend face pale with pity for the prisoner and for the hapless lady who sat beside him; his deep voice vibrating with emotion as he- pronounced upon the living the doom-of the dying. "Gerald Ross Mostyn--The crime of which you stand convicted, and for which you are about to suffer death, is one of the most heinous that the heart of man can conceive, or the hand of man perpetrate.

There are many good people who regard creature com- forts as the grand panacea for all the ills that flesh is heir to; hence, I suppose, arose the custom of funeral feasts. Honest Mrs. Wardour was one of this sort. Upon this morning her snowiest damask table-cloth and best china seryce adorned the table, which was provided with the strongest and most fragrant coffee, the most delicate muf- fins, the freshest butter, the purest honey, the tenderest beefsteaks, and the clearest marmalade to be found on any breakfast-table in the county. But alas? little justice could her hapless guest do these tempting viands. A little coffee quaffed with difficulty, a morsel of bread swallowed with distress, and she arose, put on her bonnet and shawl, and hastened to the prison. Near the gate she found Dr. Heath and Mr. Osborne waiting for the X our of opening to be admitted. Both these gentlemen, upon the committal of Mr. Mos- tyn, had been inclined to abandon him, for there is nothing tha tso entirely repels as the discovery, or the supposed discovery, of the guilt of those in whom we had placed implicit confidence. But as soon as a criminal is cast for death, even those the most shocked at his guilt, the most eager in denunciation, the most zealous in prosecution, suddenly grow compassionate, do all they can to alleviate the condition of the convict; nay, had they the power, might remit the punishment., The two gentlemen whe intercepted Constance at the prison gate were of this stamp.

They accosted Con. stance with deep respect, and informed her of the errand that had brought them thither. She returned thanks, ana then, addressing Dr. Heath, said--  "Doctor, my physical powers fail me, and I would not have the failure of my frame to add one feather's weight to the- load of grief oppressing my husband's heart. Tell me, therefore, is there :any balm in Gilead' to restore my energies?"  While Dr. Heath gazed in silent and respectful sympathy upon her, Mr. Osborne reverentially raised her hand, and said- "Pray, my dear child. Appeal to the Source of Power, who has promised that 'as thy day is,' so shall thy strength be." "I do, sir; I pray daily, hourly, and I am heard, for I receive the promise. My spirit is strong-strong to endure and to attempt; but my flesh, sir, is very, very weak; I would have something to keep nerve and muscle up to their workj therefore, Doctor," she said, suddenly turning to Dr. Heath--"tell me if there is any thing in materia onediea that will aid me in this?" "Assuredly there is, madam; Providence never left us ' without remedy for the most distressing of all physical ailments--the wear and tear of sorrow and anxiety. I will send you a safe restorative and support." -"I thank you, sir." The Agates being opened, they entered the prison and went up to: the' cell. They found Mr. Mostyn calm, firm, and self-possessed as heretofore. A night of solitude, self- examination, and prayer, had renewed -his spirit's-strength. The two gentlemen offered their services in any manner in which they could be made available to the prisoner. And their proffers were frankly accepted in case, there should be eed. A man of more arrogance andlecss justice than   THE   GIP-SY'S PROPHECY.     217 Gerald Mostyn might have repudiated these offers, and replied-           \      . "Since you cannot accept me as guiltless, I cannot permit you to serve me." But Mr. Mostyn, in a more Christian spirit, anqgered- "Since you cannot get over the evidence that has con- victed me, and yet still accord me your good wishes annd good offices, I thank you, and in case of' need, will avail myself of your kindness, feeling sure, that sooner or later, in time or in eternity, you will know me to be guiltless, even as my Constance knows it now." We will not linger over this interview, or over those that followed. It is enough to say that Constance, by constant' prayer, and by the occasional aid of a restorative, by using all spiritual and material means, was enabled to sustain her firm, calm, and cheerful demeanor throughout the day, in the presence of her husband, however utterly she gave way and broke down at-night in the solitude of her chamber. Mr. Mostyn maintained his calmness, courage, and self- possession. One favor he took occasion. privately to re- quest of the sheriff; it was that, when the death-warrant arrived, it might be read in the absence of his wife. "This request was, of course, respected. The warrpntt came within the week, and fixed the day of execution for the 1st of February ensuing. The sheriff took occasion to read it t6Othe prisoner during the temporary absence of Constance upon some business in the village. Upon her return she found nothing in the countenance or demeanor of her-  husband to suggest that any thing unusual had occurred.  But while they sat together, he reading the Bible, and commenting upon its divine words, and she engaged in some little needlework for his comfort, the door was opened and the jailer appeared, asking, with his usual air of grave respect-- "Will Mr. Mostyn receive his counsel?"   &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7861-00000100"/> 218    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. "Certainly; admit them at once, Mr. Wardour," replied the prisoner. And Messrs. Wright and Brent walked into the cell. With those already within, they almost filled the narrow space. Bowing deeply to Constance, Mr. Wright passed to the side of the prisoner, and said, in a-low voice-- "We have come upon business; is it your pleasure that it should be broached in the presence of this lady?" "Assuredly, sir. You witnessed the deportment of my wife during the trial, and can have no doubt of her firm- ness," replied Mr. Mostyn. "Then," said Mr. Wright, "we think that the moment has arrived when it is proper and expedient to draw up a petition for pardon to be presented ,to the Home Secretary.  "A petition I do not object to. I cannot, however, consent that it shall be for pardon, inasmuch as that would be a virtual confession of a crime never committed- neither do I think that such a petition would be granted. But "let it be for respite, that, more opportunity may be afforded for the discovery of truth, and the establishment of my innocence--innocence which must be reiterated and insisted upon. Such a- petition would also be more reasonable and more likely to be granted."' To this view of the case the counsel acceded, and after some little further consultation, they retired to draw tp the document, ,/   CHAPTE R XXII.

THE petition for respite was drawn up by Mr. Wright, read and approved by Mr. Mostyn, and signed by a large number of persons-even by those who, during the trial, had been most denunciatory, but who, since the prisoner was sentenced to death, were the most sympathizing, and also by conscientious persons, who would have refused to put their names to a pardon, but readily signed one for respite. Mr. Wright undertook the journey to London to present the petition to the Home Secretary. It was an affair of several days, which were passed in great anxiety by the unhappy prisoner and his suffering wife. ' At length, at the end of the week, the messenger returned. The petition was refused I The intelligence was communicated to the hapless pair, as they sat together, as usual, in the cell. "God's will be done!" was the only comment made by Mr. Mostyn. Constance averted her head; for one instant the same loud sound, as of the rushing of many waters, rang through her ears and brain; sudden darkness, as of a thunder-cloud, whelmed -her eyes and heart; her muscles failed her, her breath ceased, her pulses stopped, as once before,; then by a mighty effort of the will, she saved herself from swoon- ing, resumed her self-control, and -turned a calm gaze of consoling faith upon her husband's countenance. She (219)  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7861-00000101"/> 220    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. would not, as yet, trust her voice to speak, but when she did, her words and tones were courageous and inspiring. But from this day, blow after blow fell upon the devoted heads of the unhappy pair. The next morning's paper announced the day fixed for the execution of Gerald Mostyn. He would willingly have kept the intelligence from his wife, but- that Constance Jlearned it from popular gossip. And, after fervent prayer for strength, and long struggle, she once more gained the supremacy over sorrow, terror, and despair, and, with a calm and comforting coun- tenance, entered her husband's cell, sat down beside him on the cot, laid her gentle hand upon his shoulder, raised her true eyes to his face, and said- "Dearest Gerald, I know all-all that you know-and can bear all that you bear. Let there be no more conceal- ments, as there shall b- no more partings between us. For mark you, Mr. Mostyn, so long as I live and you live, I will remain,with you. Ah, my husband, through all-all I What you can endure I can endure. And to the last mo- ment of your life I will be by your side. My hand shall be thbelast to clasp your own, my eyes the last to receive your gaze 1" "Constance I Father in Heaven I Constance, have you strength to do this?"     / "God helping me, I have and I will do it-and then die P" she mbntally added.        a Calmly, firmly, and even cheerfully, Constance bore up during the day; and at night, no eye save that of the Om- niscient witnessed the crushing sorrow that overwhelmed and held her in its serpent folds until the morning, when the necessity of appearing with a serene countenance in the presence -of her husband, imparted a sort of miraculous strength of endurance and self-control. ' HGerald :lostyn also exercised a marvelous pawer of seljfgoverament. Feeling deeply the dark degradation,   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHO C Yi,      221 of his; present position and approaching fate-his life of lofty aspiration,- persevering effort, and recently-acquired honors, prematurely blighted; his popular favor turned, to public execration; his well-won fame to unmerited infamy; his promise of glorious days cut short by shameful death; his sole legacy to his widowed bride a dishonored name and an incurable sorrow. Ah, heaven, he felt it all. He suf- fered only as the strong in heart can suffer, and endured only as the great in soul can endurq without a complaint, without a groan, without a' sigh t at might wound the spirit of another.  His time was passed in preparation for death--in "set- ting his house in order," and girding himself for his journey through the " valley of the shadow." He made such pro- vision for Constance, until her majority, as his limited means would permit. He wrote letters -or received visits from such friends as evil fortune had left him, and he passed many hours of the day and night in reading the Bible, in meditation, and in prayer.             ' 'F' Through all these days his friends, were not idle. Re- newed application had been made in his behalf for the clemency of the Crown, but made, alas! ini vain. No par- don, no reprieve, not a day's respite from death was granted to the unhappy man. Constance, whose faith in her husband's perfect guilt- lessness amounted to knowledge, and who confidently be- f lieved that if the opportunity were given her, she Should be able to impress the same faith upon the mind of the Minister, who would then feel constrained to grant the pe- tition, besought with tears and prayers to be permitted to journey to the capital, and seek an interview with the Home S'ecretary. - But it was now the dead of winter; the snow lay two feet deep -upon the level, and drifted in avalanches along the mountain-passes; the weather was tempestuous, the  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7861-00000102"/> 222    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. roads difficult and impracticable, coach and wagon traveli ing on many routes had stopped; and Mr. Mostyn would 'in nowise consent that his wife should undertake a journey that he knew would be a useless endangering of her health and life, or seek an interview which he felt in his soul would involve a fruitless sacrifice of her self-respect and dignity. Meanwhile his wife was dwindling to the shortest span. It was a few days before that appointed for his execu- tion, when an event occurred that revived the dying hope of Constance. Lord Starr arrived at Llyndell on his route north. Constance chanced to receive this intelligence on the very evening of the day of the Minister's arrival. She was informed of it after she had left the prison, and was on her way up to her " chamber of desolation," by Mrs. War- dour, who had heard the news from a Llyndell man who had come into town. Constance's oppressed heart rebounded in her bosom. Now she would have the prayed-for opportunity of speaking with the. Secretary, her old friend and suitor. Surely he would listen to her arguments-surely -he would be. im- pressed with herfaith and grant her request. She hurried up into her chamber, closed the door, and threw herself on her knees to pray for a blessing upon her purposed under- taking, before she sought repose. Repose I for many weeks misery had murdered sleep; now hope kept, her wide awake. Early in the morning she sought her husband's cell, told him the news, and renewed her request. With impassioned earnestness she implored his permission to seek the Secre,- tary's presence. "For oh, Mr. Mostyn," she said, "even should the peti, tion be again rejected, and the worst befall, it will be my only earthly comfort to remember that this means of saving you-was not left untried."   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.       22, This last argument was irresistible, and the passionately- desired permission was given. Constance hastened to make her preparations. The perilous state of the mountain-pass precluded the possibility of traveling by a carriage; but through the good offices of Mr. Wardour, she procured the use of a sure-footed horse for herself, and a mountain pony for William War- dour, who was to attend her on her journey. It was but six o'clock in the morning when the lady and her young groom set forth. A hard ride of several hours through the wintry woods -of the plain brought them to the foot of the ridge, then two hours' slow and toilsome efforts brought them up the steep and rugged ascent, and down the yet more difficult and dangerous declivity of the snow-covered mountain-pass, at the foot of which nestled the old man- sion house of Llyndell. It was with suspended breath and pausing pulse that Constance drew rein at the door of her old home, in which, but one short month before, she had been made a blessed bride, but to which she was now an alien, and at which sojourned the one man who held her fiusband's--nay, her- own life,-in the hollow of his hand I In this wintry weather there was no servant lingering about the outside of the premises, so her little groom sprang from his pony, took the reins from her hand, led her horse to the block, secured him, and offered his hand to assist her in alighting. With an effort that brought breath back to her laden lungs, and sent the curdling blood circulating through her -eins, she leaped lightly from her horse, and, trembling in -every limb, went up the steps to the porch-that very porch which had witnessed the betrothal of herself and Gerald. , The window-shutters of the two front rooms on either side of the entrance-door were open, and the ruddy glow of fire-light, through crimson curtains, shone out in com, I .  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7861-00000103"/> 822a4   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. fortable contrast to the snow-clad earth and wintry wind without. She went to the door and knocked, and was admitted by David, who stared at her with speechless surprise, and then looked frightened at having unwittingly shown her so much courtesy as to open the door. "Is Lord Starr staying here, DaVid?" "Yes'm," replied the man, with dying tones and dilated eyes. Constance tore a leaf from her tablets, and wrote a few lines as follows:- "Mrs. Gerald Mostyn presents her respectful compli- ments to Lord Starr, and begs the favor of an interview in the library, where she awaits his lordship." She placed it in the hands of the boy, saying "Show me into the library, and then take this to Lord Starr.   . "Yes'm," ejaculated the man, who, though frightened at What he had done and was about to do, was so constrained by her commanding manner, that he instantly obeyed. Leading the way up-stairs, he opened the door into a well-warmed and well-lighted library--the very library in which, a month before, her happy bridegroom, now, alas! a prisoner under sentence of death, had taken a parting glass of wine with his circle of congratulating friends, just a moment previous to his unexpected arrest.! She seated herself in one of the easy chairs that sat on each side of the round table which stood before the glow- ing grate. Leaning her elbow on the table and her head upon her hand, she waited in intense anxiety the coming of the Home ;Secretary. Ah, Constance was greatly changed within the last few weeks. The firm contour of form and feature, the gentle pride of eye: and brow, the graceful hauteur of air and car- rioE were. gone now.  Her fine face was delicate even to   THE  rGIPSY'S PROPHE:CY.       22" fragility; her pure complexion pale and transparent aS pearl in contrast to the rich, dark tresses plainly divided over her noble brow; her large, dark-gray eyes smouldered in'deepest gloom beneath their long black lashes, or sud- denly flashed forth with the wild and frightened glare of a, hunted hart. She wore, perhaps in lack of something plainer, a riding-habit of rich black cloth, with a black hat and feather, and a vail of black Chantilly lace. A delicate white linen collar and cuffs, and dainty black kid gloves, completed her elegant costume. A -mournful beauty in her attitude and air lent an irresistible- charm to her ap- pearance. Lord Starr was far too gallant to keep a lady waiting. Perhaps the reader knows that chivalric gallantry is the Peculiar forte of good-looking single gentlemen of an un- certain age. At all events, in something less than three minutes from the time that David left the library, the door opened and Lord Starr entered-a tall, finely-formed, rather stout, very handsome, grave, and dignified gentle- man, of about fifty-two, with an'erect form, and square, massive face, framed in a profusion of iron-gray hair and whiskers, and with a tone, a glance, and a smile of peculiar fascination, when he pleased to exercise that power. "Good morning, madam," he said, with his softes) voice, and with his most winning smile and courteous bow, as he advanced towards the table o6: the left of which Con- :stance was seated. The lady arose to receive him, but with a graceful wave of his hand, and a gracious tone, he prayed her to resume her seat, and prom0ised to followsher example. They sat down-Lord Starr on the right, Constance on the left, the round table between them, the glowing fire -before them. "I trust that you have been well; madam, since I had the honor of meeting you last?" inquired the Secretary, 'in a bland voice, as he rested his left elbow upon the table, *' aibland vote     e table-  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7861-00000104"/> 226    THE GIPSY'S    PROPHECY. and turned with a smile of grave courtesy towards his companion. "As well, sir, as my calamitous circumstances will admit," replied the lady, truthfully, but with a choking voice, for it tried her soul to listen to these common-places of courtesy now so very much out of place. There was a silence of a few minutes, during which Con- stance struggled with herself, and strove for words where-! with to open that communication for which the Secretary seemed courteously to wait. Perceiving at length, how- ever, that each moment her embarrassment grew deeper and more distressing, he graciously relieved her, by saying, with a show of great deference-- "You did me the honor, madam, to command my attend- ance. I am here at your orders. Will you deign, there- fore, to inform me in what manner I can be so happy as to serve you 7" "Ah I sir, can you be at a loss to know!" exclaimed Constance, with passionate earnestness. The Secretary turned his head, with an attitude and ex- pression of polite attention, and well-assumed perplexity- he seemed very much at a loss. "Will you do me the honor, madam, to explain in what way I can be so fortunate as to please you?" "Please me! Oh, sir I you can do infinitely more than please me I You can give me back my life and all that makes life of any worth!" exclaimed Constance, clasping her hands, and raising her eyes imploringly to his face. ",Speak, madam I I fear you over-rate my power; but all that a man may do for, a lady I freely promise. Com- mand me, madam." Without another word Constance arose, and with a pro- found obeisance, laid her petition upon the table before him. The Secretary raised it, recognized it as the petition   THE  GIPSY S PROPHECY.       227 that he had seen and rejected before, and, with a well- feigned look of sorrow, gently pushed it aside, saying, with grave courtesy-  "Your commands, as I feared, transcend my powers of compliance, madam." "Oh! do not say so, sir. Well do I know that this Divine power of life and death is vested for us in your in- fluence with the Crown. Give us' life lift the miserable woman before you from the deepest depths of a sorrow you never dreamed of to the heights of a joy you can never imagine!" prayed Constance, with hands wrung together until their delicate blue veins were started up and knotted like dark cords, and with wild dilated eyes, fixed in pas- sionate supplication upon his face. "You love this bridegroom of yours very much, madam," said the Secretary, with a strange and ominous change in his voice. i Love im Pn!" responded Constance, in a tone deep, low, and vibrating with intense emotion-"Love him! Oh, sir! at a less solemn crisis your question might call a blush to my cheek; but not now--not when life or death may hang upon the next words you utter! Yes, I love him /- so much that if he should Suffer the death to which he is condemned, I also, who have not been tried or convicted, must share his unmerited fate-for I could not survive  8 him 1" "What, madam, would you be a suicide?" exclaimed the Secretary, in a voice of horror.   7 "No, no; nor would it be:.necessary. I should not destroy myself, but die!" "Madam-all this while you are standing. I pray you! resume your seat."  "No, no, sir I This attitude, or one still more humble, is the proper posture for a supplicant in the presence of the power who holds her life in his hands!"  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7861-00000105"/> 228   -THE   GIPSY'S PROPHECY. "W Vhy harp you on this subject, lady?I hold no power over your precious life." "Over my husband's, then; and through his, over mine." "You, mistake, madam. My power is not so unlimited as you imagine," he said. Taking up the petition, glanc- ing over it, and then laying it down, he continued, "the pardoning prerogative, as vested in the Crown, is certainly a discretionary power; but it is, also, a holy trust, and should be exercised only on rare occasions, well understood, and on certain conditions, under no one of which Mr. OMostyn's case comes. He has had a fair trial; he has been convicted under the most crushing weight of both circumstantial evidence and positive testimony, which has left not the shadow of a doubt as to his guilt in -the minds of any, except, perhaps, his too confiding bride, and which has left no possible loop-hole for his escape from death. Pardon me, madam, that I speak thus plainly upon a most painful subject. Hdo so only to justify myself before you." While he spoke Constance stood with her form half bent towards him, her white hands wrung painfully together, her bloodless lips, compressed, and her wild, impassioned eyes strained forth in an agony of entreaty. "Oh, sir," she began, " there is no need to justify your- self to me. And neither do I petition for a pardon, since no crime has been committed. But for a respite from death I implore you on my knees!" she continued, sinking at his feet, and bowing her head almost to the dust before him. "Madam, arise. The respite for which you pray falls under the same rule as the pardon for which you scorn to petition. I could as consistently advise the one as the other. And if I could, bethink you, dear lady, of what little use such respite would be.--It would, indeed, only serve to prolong the agony better got over at once. Dear lady, arise. It wounds me cruelly to see you thus," he   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.       229 said, taking her hand, and gently essaying to lift her to her feet.  "No, nol  No, no!

She raised her eyes in consternation to his face. There was certainly nothing in that countenance to ter- rify or discourage her. It was, as I have before described it to be-a fine one; and now far more benignant in promise than any of his words had been. Constance cast her fate upon the countenance, and answered, with grave sweetness-- "Remember those things no longer, sir, or, remember them only in mercy; and if ever you have esteemed poor Constance Wynne, be magnanimous to Constance Mostyn." "I will endeavor to be just, at least. Constance, a respite would do Mr. Mostyn no good; it would but indefinitely prolong his imprisonment with the faint 'hope deferred that maketh the heart sick.',' He paused, and gazed down upon his supplicant, who remained with her hands clasped, and her eyes fixed upon him with the same expression of wild entreaty. !"Constance," he said, " there is one condition upon which I will interfere to save Gerald Mostyn's life, so that he shall go forth from the prison a free man." The blood rushed in torrents to her brow, and, retreating, left her even paler than before. Her eyes were more wildly dilated; she looked and felt like one suddenly stricken with madness. "What is it you say?" she inquired, in a voice sunken with intense anxiety and perplexity. "Oh, did I hear aright? you will save his life?" "His LIFE will I save upon a certain condition.', Constance sprang to her feet, as an overwhelming tide of joy rushed over her.

"Be seated, dear lady, while I speak of the terms upon which I will do as I have promised," said the Secretary, as, with grave courtesy, he handed his companion to a chair, and drew his own to her side. "And now-the conditions," said Constance. Lord Starr arose, and with his graceful, gliding step, passed to the door, opened it, looked out, and apparently satisfied that 'the coast was clear, re-closed it, and returned, and resumed his seat opposite Constance. He drew his chair forward, so that when he rested his elbow on the table, and leaned his head upon his hand, his face was somewhat too familiarly close to that of the lady. "This is understood to be a confidential interview, madam?" "Since you desire-yes, my lord," said Constance, with dignity, only inform me in what manner you can save my husband." "Nay, madam, that is only to be imparted upon condi- tions. I have also to ask of you a promise, that all which passes between us in this interview shall, in any event, be kept private." Constance paused a moment to reflect, and then answered directly, but still with dignity- "Your lordship has my promise."

"- Constance Wynue, I love you," began the Minister, in a hesitating voice. But Constaice sprang to her feet- the indignant blood in torrents crimsoning her face, neck, and bosom, fire flash- ing from her eyes, anger convulsing her frame. She could not speak, but stood for an instant pressing both hands hard upon her heart to keep down its rising passion. Then growing very pale, she suddenly turned, and walked towards the door. Lord Starr started up to delay her. "Madam-Oonstance, do not leave me thus ! hear me - explain." But as if scorning to hold an instant of further conversa- tion with one so base, the lady walked on. " Constance-madam, you must really hear me," per- sisted Lord Starr, following her, and seizing her hand. But scorning to struggle, to reply, or even to listen, she just put forth her other hand, took the bell-rope,-and rang Appeal that presently brought David into the room. "Attend me to the door," commanded Constance to this functionary, who immediately obeyed her.

He was seated at his little stand deeply engaged in the perusal of the Scriptures. When she appeared, he looked up, arose, and held out his arms. She approached and sank into them. He asked no question; she volunteered no information. - It was a silent embrace. Then he released her, and they both sat down upon the side of the bed, holding each other's hands.

She arose and threw herself into his arms, cast hers about his shoulders, and strained him to her faithful bosom, and amid the most fervent caresses, murmured- "A long life will remain to both! to both! but it will be a life beyond the grave Oh I I am thine own I own I own I Nothing--not death itself-can sever us I God will not leave me when he takes thee 1 He is too good I He will not curse me so I There is no reason why I should be left. I have, beside thee, no close tie on earth-none 1 No one will be bereaved by my departure-no, not one I Therefore, there is no reason why I should not accompany thee on thy journey to the other world, and I feel that the Lord will let me go. We shall begin our married life in that other world, dearest! and I am content I I am happy, since we go together!" Extremes meet. Sorrow sometimes sublimes to rapture. But it is only the utmost stretch of grief that so reaches ecstacy. And thus it was with Constance now. But it is an overstrain of nature, that cannot last long; either the mind flies off in frenzy and confirmed mania, "or there is a sudden collapse and fall into despair and idiotcy, or else death steps in and closes the scene. It could not last long with Constance. It was obvious to the most superfcial observer, that without the interven- tion of an especial Providence, it would be as she had said, she would die with her husband I He laid her head upon his breast, and soothed her excited mind. He asked her no questions relative to her interview with the minister; he knew that it was fruitless 'l   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY.      235  and he felt that it must also have been painful, and re- frained from troubling her to recur to the details. And Constance forbore to distress him with any hint of that conversation. Nothing more was said on the topic of reprieve, nor was the subject recurred to between them again. The next day, the newspaper, the Weekly Beacon, con- tained the following paragraph:-- "THE APPROACHNGo EXECUTION.--We understand that yesterday afternoon a final appeal for pardon was made by the wife of Gerald Mostyn to Lord Starr, at Llyndeltl where his lordship is on a visit of a few days. ThTs last petition having been rejected, the unhappy prisoner will suffer the extreme penalty of the law." Constance only saw the caption of that paragraph, and, shuddering, turned her eyes away. But Mr. Mostyn read it through, and with a melancholy smile, laid the paper aside. The remainder of the week was passed by the hap- less pair in preparation for the great change that awaited them. A calmness that looked like fortitude, but was only de- spair, had settled upon Constance. "Pale and still and silently," she walked at morn from her lodgings to the prison, and at evening from the prison to her lodgings. Scarcely an atom of food passed her lips by day, scarcely an instant's sleep visited her eyes at night. Only in the presence of her husband was she calm, tender, and devoted. Gerald Mostyn passed *is few remaining hours of life in reading the Scriptures, in prayer, and in converse with hisbeloved wife. His fortitude never for an instant forsook him, save when he looked at Constance, saw how much she suffered, and how much for his sake she suppressed I And he was almost tempted to wish that it might be even as she said-that she might be permitted to die with him rather than suffered to live a long life of incurable despair. He  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7861-00000109"/> 286    THE  GiPSY7S PROPHECY. prayed with her and for her. And thus in sorrow, but in mutual support, the hours passed that brought the night before the exeeution-his last night of life I The last night of Gerald Mostyns allotted lifel is few short years of youth were spent and gone; his days were fled; his future contained only hours, and they were numbered; for before the noon of another day it was appointed for him to die i1 No poweron earth save one could redeem him from the grave, and that one had utterly refused to interfere. 'e must, therefore, surely die; his brief and fitful dream of life was over I It was now six o'clock, -the usual hour at which Con- stance was accustomed  to take leave of him for the night. The hapless couple sat together on the side of the bed. Before them  stood the little stand, upon which was a lighted lamp and an open 'Bible, a chapter of which they had just finished reading. Each had stifled the mighty anguish of the breast, and had struggled to comfort ind sustain the other. They were now silent; and the awful : shadow-of death seemed lowering over the heads of both. - Through imprisonment, sorrow, and anxiety, Mr. Mos- tyn had become emaciated in feature, and cadaverous in complexion; but in the expression of his countenance, in his words and manners, he still evinced unshaken firmness. Grief, care, and vigilance had so blanched and sharpened the :face of Constance, that her large gray eyes, and her broad expanse of brow, crowned with its "aureole of ebon locks, seemed preternaturally developed. Yet she, too, though secretly dying of sorrow, exhibited a matchless patience and serenity. But it was now, as I said, six o'clock, theusual hour of closing. Good Ar. Wardour tapped at the cell door, and upon the response of Mr. Mostya bidding him come in, he unlocked the door, and entered.   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.       231 "You are about to shut up for the night?" inquired the prisoner. "Yes," replied the warden, in a broken voice, for he sympathized deeply and painfully with the hapless pair. "Constance, dearest Constance, bid me good night and leave me now,"- said Mr. Mostyn, gently drawing his bride to his bosom for a parting embrace. "I will never leave thee more," responded the lady, in a low, deep voice. "But, sweet wife, reflect 1" "I have reflected. And for the few short hours we have to live, I will remain by thy side." "My own dearest I take some pity on yourself I Do not so fearfully try your strength," he entreated, gazing on her tortured but resolute countenance. "I have strength to suffer all, save separation from thee in thy time of trial; strength to do all save desert thee in thy hour of bitterest need; strength to bear all that may be required of me!" she replied. And then turning to the jailer, she added-                   i "Mr. Wardour, I shall not leave --my husband's cell to- night." The jailer bowed in silence; he was sure that he was not doing right in permitting this infringement of custom; but he could not find it in his heart to refuse this last comfort to the unhappy lady.          . It was usual to leave a turnkey in the cell of the con- demned to guard his person through the night preceding his execution; but this also the kind-hearted jailer took upon himself to modify. When about to withdraw from the cell, he said- "Mr. Mostyn, Tom Turner will lie on a mattress outside the door; so that if you should need any thing in the night, or early in the morning, you have only to rap and he will attend you"      &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7861-00000110"/> 288    THE  GIPSYIS  PROPHECY. "I thank you very much, Mr. Wardour," replied the prisoner, who perfectly understood this change of the usual custom, and accordingly appreciated the kindness. "I thank you very much; and while I have the opportunity, permit me to express my acknowledgments for all the kind attention you have shown me since I have been your " "Guest," interrupted the jailer, who never could endure to hear the word " prisoner" spoken., "Well, sir, it is my desire, as well as my interest, to make all my guests as comfortable as circumstances will permit. Good-night, sir. God comfort you, madam..? And so saying, the good- hearted man withdrew from the cell. "I'm done for, Tom Turner, if any mishap comes of this here," said the tender-hearted jailer, as he rejoined his turnkey. "I may lose my place for what I know, but I couldn't help it i I couldn't refuse that sweet, suffering lady any thing as I could indulge her in Lor, Tom Turner, there shouldn't nobody be hung if I was the monarch." "No more there shouldn't, sir, if I was the Minister," said the turnkey. "' Tom Turner!" "Yes, Sir.  "I don't think as I can stand this here much longer." "No more don't I, sir." "We was a deal happier when we kept the public, and entertained merry travelers instead of sad prisoners." "And I served out cakes and ale instead of bread and broth."  ' Tom Turner P" "Yes, sir." "If I lose my place, we'll keep a public again, and you shall be head. waiter." 'Thank 'ee, sir." "Tom Z" "Sir '"   THE  GIPSY'S   pOPHEO. 239 "I'm blamed if I care if I do lose the place." "No more do I, sir." "There's nothing like a merry heart, and that is what I haven't had since I have been warden of Gwyn jail." "No more have I sir," said Tom Turner, and the tw o kind-hearted creatures left the lobby. Meanwhile, left alone with Constance in his cell, Gerald trimmed his lamp and resumed the reading of the Scrip- tures. He read in- a low and modulated voice, to reach only the ear of his wife, the seven penitential Psalms of David, and then the last seven chapters of the Gospel of St. John, containing the most eloquent account of the last scenes of our Saviour's mortal life. After which they knelt and prayed together-prayed'fervently for resignation to the will of Heaven; for grace to forgive their destroyers, even as te the Sinless One had forgiven his enemies and lastly, for strength to go through the awful trial that awaited them upon the morrow. These devotions occupied the whole evening until ten o'clock. Then, calmed, strengthened, and refreshed, their prepared for rest. Neither expected to sleep; buteach sought repose only in the hope of bringing it to the other. The eyes of Constane never closed in sleep for one single instant, but lest her wakefulness should keep him from slumber, she remained perfectly still. Gerald, believing her to be asleep, thanked God for the blessing, and fearing to stir lest he should awaken her, gave himself up to such meditations as he deemed appro- priate to his condition. IS the midst of-these, sleep, like a benedicite, fell softly on his soul. Constanc e k ne by his regular breathing that- this was so. And she folded her hands together and prayed for him-and for herself so far as that she might be permitted to die when he should die. While thus praying, the angel of sleep pressed down her eyelids also, and she, too, slept. eyld lo  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7861-00000111"/> It is passing sweet so to sleep, and to forget our sor- rows; but oh I it is terrible after such a sleep, and such a forgetting, to awake to all the awful--realities of fate!  Memory then returns with the tremendous shock of a first calamity. Constance sleeps and dreams a sweet dream of love and glory. In her dream she is a happy bride, by her husband's side. Their earthly ambition is crowned with the highest success. He moves, and fame follows his footsteps, and she basks in his reflected light. They stand within a vast and crowded hall; he speaks, and admiring multitudes hang upon his inspired and inspiring words. The scene changes: He stands within a magnificent hall, sumptuous with velvet, hangings, splendid with re'ected light, crowded with an innumerable company. ' e is greeted with shouts of applause by the vast assembly that fills to suffocation the great hall; by the crowds that choke up the galleries, stairs, lobbies and ante-rooms leading to it; thunders of applause rend the very sky In theintensity of her delight and triumph for him, Constance awakes Oh, God I  Oh, God I The narrow walls of the prison cell enclose her!

" And bid me not depart,"' she cried; "My husband say not so ! This is no time to quit thy side- Peace ! Peae ! I cannot go! I have been with thee in thine hour Of glory and of bliss; Doubt not its memory's living power To strengthen me in this ! 'And thou, mine honored love and true, H Bear on, bear nobly on ! We have the blessed heaven in view, Whose rest shall soon be won !"--r 1's. /emn.s, THE shouts she had heard in her dream were the voices of a rude crowd in the street below the prison, who were cursing, swearing, and elbowing each other, as they hurried tumultuously onward to secure good standing-places on Gallows-hill, outside the town, where the execution was to take place.  Constance saw and heard them as she turned and looked through the grated window that was close be- side her pillow and that overlooked the street below; and, totally bereft of courage by her bright, delusive dream and its terrible contrast, she cowered down, groaning, shudder-  ing, and writhing in extremity of anguish. "My Constanpe ! my beloved one I take courage I" It was his voice that spoke I his voice 1 it recalled her to a sense of duty I With' one of those mighty efforts in which years of vitality are in m -moment consumed, she con- trolled her agony, composed herself, and arose. " It was the dream that did it; but fear nothing for me,: dearest; I am myself, and shall not fail again I" she said, sweetly, yielding her lips to his kiss as serenely as if she had only arisen to superintend their house and sit at the head of their table.'

For what says the poet- "Our life is but a sleep and a forgetting; The soul that rises in us, our life's star, Hath had elsewhere its setting, And cometh from afar. "Sweet Constance! our dream of life is almost over I Is it so hard, dear love, to wake?" "No, no, not when we awake together," she murmured. 'They soon knelt and offered up their morning orisons. It was well: they received new strength from this, for as they arose beside the cot, the little grated window was before them, and through its bars they saw the eastern horizon all blazing with the glorious light of the rising sun, and the snow-clad hills all crimsoned with the ruddy reflec- tion; but oh, God of mercies I there, on the highest hill-- there, strongly marked against the white background of the snow and the crimson glow of the sky-reared the ghastly gallows I , A motley crowd surrounded the scaffold; other crowds in different groups, by different paths, were climbing the hill. With a terrible shudder, Constance turned away her head and covered her eyes. Calmly Gerald Mostyn drew the little curtain across the grating, to shut from her eyes the view. The turnkey soon tapped at the cell door, entered and supplied them with the simple necessaries for their prison toilet. Then the warden came with the slight breakfast, which, with the exception of the coffee, was sent untasted away. The brief winter morning was already far spent; the execution was appointed to take place netween the hours of nine and twelve.- It was now half-past nine. As the humble breakfast-service was removed, Mr. Osborne enr,   THE   -GIPSY's PROP1ECY    .  243  tered the cell. In speechless sorrow he pressed the hands of Gerald and Constane. And when he had recovered his composure, he entered into conversation with them, and finding both calm and firm, he proposed prayer.  Ah, prayer! greatest comfort and support in the heaviest affictions! Often had they resorted to the fountain of strength and consolation, and never had they come un- blessed away. Again, led by the minister of God, they prayed, and again were they blessed. Ten o'clock! As they arose from their kneeling posture there was a sound of a carriage drawn up before the prison gate. Mr. Osborne shivered, for well he knew the import of that slight noise. Next there was heard the coming of several feet along the lobby, and a pausing at the cell door, followed almost instantly by the opening of the door, and the entrance of the sheriff alone. All knew his errand. He was clothed in his official suit, anda the solemnity of his countenance did not belie his sombre costume. He looked much disturbed on seeing the lady still in the cell; but recovered himself, bowed, and in- quired of Mr. Mostyn whether he had slept well, and how he found himself this morning. Mr. Mostyn answered that he had rested through the Inight, and was prepared this morning to meet his fate. Again the sheriff bowed, looked with a -troubled expres- sion of countenance at Constance, and touching the elbow of the clergyman, drew him aside and whispered- ," Why is it that Mrs. Mostyn is still suffered by her friends to linger here. .She should have been taken away before this. Pray see to it that she goes now." ("What? Has their parting come so soon? When do we leave the prison for the place of execution?" asked the minister, in distress.

I will retire for fifteen minutes; you may leave them alone for that length of time if they desire it, but at the end of fifteen minutes you will please to take her away , "I will endeavor to do so," said the sorrowful minister. "You can leave her in a place of safety, and then return in time, as I suppose you are to attend Mr. Mostyn on the scaffold?, "Yes," said the almost broken-hearted clergyman. !"I have brought a carriage to take him to execution. Yourself and Mr. Mostyn will occupy the back seat; I will -sit infront. I leaveyou now to your task,'" concluded the sheriff, and with a grave nod, he retired from the cell. Mr. Osborne, in sorrow, drew near the prisoner and whispered--. "My dear friend, I am about to leave you alone with your wife for fifteen minutes. Say all that you have to say to her in that time, for at its conclusion you will give her to my, care, and yield. yourself with, I trust, a martyr's he- roism, to suffer the will of heaven." "I thank you," answered Gerald Mostyn.  And the minister left the cell. "Come hither, dear Constance," he said, as the clergy- man closed the door. Constance drew nearer, sat down beside him on the cot, and yielded her slight form to his encircling arm. "Sweet wife I you will not try to keep your strange resolution; you cannot go through wtih it, Constance; you will abandon it, my darling; you will suffer me now to bless you and bid you adieu, and leave you in the charge of Mr. Osborue, who .will take you to his wife, your friend I Say, sweet Constance, will you not consent to this?" "Oh, ask me not to leave you- while you live I Indeed, I  cannot do it!

You shall be with me to the last I Your hand -shall receive my latest clasp, and your eyes my latest glance; for I feel that you are heroic and devoted, and that God will sustain you or take you!" he said, and strainedher to his bosom in a fervent embrace. The fifteen minutes of grace had now elapsed, andthe clergyman had re-entered the cell, to take' leave of his friend and remove 'Constance.  ; She will not leave me i" said Mr. Mostyn. "My wife will attend me to my death." The clergyman started in surprise and distress. "Oh! this must not be," he said. "It is useless to expostulate I she will not depart from me!"                     - "But, my dear Gerald I! my poor Constance I you know not what you do!"Ps "It is useless I you can say nothing that I have not al- ready said, and said in vain I  She will not leave me l'   - While they were talking thus; the sheriff re-entered the   X cell.

Calmly she arose and confronted the sheriff, saying, quietly- "Look in my face, Mr. Harrison. Do you see any sign of weakness or of failing here? Oh, sir I with me and for him the bitterness of death is past I Sir, I have suffered every thing that cati be suffered in daily and nightly con- templating the consummation of this very day I Daily and nightly has the scaffold been present to my agonized vision, . until at9 last I have grown accustomed to its horrors; it has this hour no terrors for me I I do not dread to attend my husband thither." "Madam I but this is horrible I most horrible I that you should think of being present at such a scene i" exclaimed the sorely troubled officer. "And why, Mr. Harrison? If my dear husband were dying, should I not be permitted to sit by his side' and hold his hand or bathe his brow I Sir I he is dying now, since his very minutes are numbered. I pray for the privilege of remaining with him to the last." "But, good lady, this cannot be permitted," expostulated the shbriff. "Unfortunately for your declaration, sir, you have no power to prevent it. You may indeed debar me from the privilege of ascending the platform with him, but you can- not hinder me from standing with the many hundred others that are assembled at the foot of the scaffold," said Con- stance, firmly.        ? "The Lord is my witness, lady, that I would not debar you from one privilege that I could grant." "Then let me attend my husband to the place of death. And do, not fear that my courage will fail, or that I will give you any trouble, or hinder you in the' least, from the discharge of your duties. Again look in my eyes I Do you see failure or faltering there? Humanly speaking, my heart is broken, sir I nothing more can hurt it, and the cer-   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.       247 Atain knowledge that I shall not survive my husband one hour, gives me the strange courage at which I see you wonder." "In Heaven's name, madam, be it as you willl You have conquered me," answered the sheriff, in deep -emotion. Then going to Gerald Mostyn, he said- "We must set out almost immediately. Is there any thing you wish to attend to before we set forward?" "Nothing," said the prisoner. At a signal of the clergyman all knelt, and for the last time offered up a short and fervent prayer. As soon as they arose, Constance tied on her little bonnet, Gerald drew-her arm within his own, and, preceded by the sheriff and the clergyman, and followed by the warden and turn- key, they left the Cell and went below, where, before the prison, the fatal carriage waited. Two mounted consta- bles attended the equipage. The sheriff held the door open; Mr. Mostyn handed Constance in, and entered after her. They two occupied the back seat. The sheriff and the clergyman followed them, and took the front seat} and 'the order was given to drive on. As the carriage passed the prison gate into the street, a great shout from the rabble without greeted it. But the constable on the coach-box beside the coachman gave the order to drive rapidly, and- they were whirled along the street, followed by the hoots and cries of the crowd. A half an hour's rapid drive over the plains outside the, town, brought them to the foot of the hill upon which the scaffold had been erected. Here, as they slowly climbed the ascent, the constables had to ride before to keep off the rabble, who, anxious to get a sight at the prisoner, thronged the road. As they neared the top of the hill, they found the crowd denser. It was with difficulty, and in the face of brutal resistance,  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7861-00000115"/> O248    T    HEE GIzPSY 'S .PROPHEZCY. obscene abuse and blasphemous oaths, that the constables 'forced a way for the carriage -to pass to the foot of the scaffold. Here they entered a hollow square, formed bya -company of the county- militia, whose bayonets glittered in -the morriing sun around the scaffold. The carriage drew up near the foot of the scaffold. The sihff:got- out and handed out -his prisoner, and arm in arm they stood waiting. The minister then got out, and assisted Constance to alight; and drawing her arm in his, joined the sheriff and : the prisoner. * They all waited only for Gerald Mostyn to take leave of his wife. She came to his side with- a face blanched whiter than his own. Her. hand was clasped in his, and her eyes lifted in holy love and faith to his face.. Yet no one could look upon her marble brow and burning eyes, as they were raised to his, and not feel that her life, hung upon his-life, and that the snapping of his thread of existence would also sever her own!  ":(Come, my own Constance," he said, "show yourself a Christian woman in this trial., Here-give me both your : hands I look into my eyes 1" She gave him both her hands, and gazed with deathless ':love into his eyes. :"This is not the last clasp I this is not the last glance I We shall medet again in a very few minutes I Wait for me, love, in the heavens above, for I shall not be an hour behind 'A you," she said. "Dearest, you give me-strength to die I God bless you," he replied; pressing a parting kiss upon her lips, and beck- oning to Mr. Osborne to come and receive her from his arms. Constance returned her husband's last kiss and benedic- tion) and yielded herself to the charge of the minister, who,   THE  GIPSY'S 'PROPHEICY.       249 placing one arm around her waist to support her failing form, put her in the carriage. The sheriff drew the prisoner's arm within his own, and led him up the steps to the scaffold. When Gerald Mostyn appeared-upon the platform, high above the heads and -in full view of the vast concourse of people assembled around the scaffold, a: terrible' shout greeted him. But when the next moment Mr. Osbornei the clergyman, stepped upon the platform, and stood beside the condemned, a dead silence of awe fell upon the turbu- lent human sea, and there was a great calm I Two depu- ties to attend the sheriff followed the pastor. In the centre, upon the fatal trap, stood Gerald Mostyn, whose pale face formed a ghastly contrast to the simple black dress he wore; on his right stood the minister of God, with an- open prayer-book in his hand. Behind them stood the sheriff's officers. So absorbed were they in the momentous scene in which they were the actors, that they were totally unconscious of: the tumult that was beginning to agitate the vast multitude around the scaffold. The minister opened the book, and amid a death-like, silence, commenced reading the solemn service for the dead. The ritual occupied some fifteen minutes, and when it was over, and the minister's voice had ceased, you might have heard a pin fall, so perfect was the stillness. The supreme moment-the moment of the execution-had arrived. At a signal from the sheriff, the clergyman pressed the hand of the prisoner, and withdrews'from his sie.

The vast sea of heads swayed violently to and fro, like the waves of the ocean lashed by a storm, or the multitudinous leaves of the forest driven by the wind. "'A reprieve I a reprieve 1" again arose in thunder from the ground. And as the crowd swayed and parted right and left, a horseman, bearing a white flag, with his steed covered with foam, and his dress stained with travel, galloped furiously onward, and threw himself from his saddle at the foot of the scaffold. The steed tottered and fell from exhaustion. But the rider, giving no thought to this, sprang up the ladder, bounded upon the platform, and thrust a sealed paper into the hands of the sheriff. That officer tore open the packet, ran his eyes hurriedly over its contents, and then, turning to the anmazed prisoner, held out his hand, and said-                  - "Mr. Mostyn, allow me to congratulate you I The Home Secretary has relented. His lordship has procured you a  respite." "My lGod, I   thank thee 1" were Gerald Mostyn's first words. His next thought was of his wife-- "Constancel oh, Constance 1" he cried, stretching his arms towards the carriage where'she lay insensible in the arms of the minister But Constance had fainted. .She had been prepared for death, but not for life; and the sudden joy of the respite had overwhelmed her, and she lay in a deep swoon. But joy never kills. Constance was soon recovered, and took her seat beside her husband on their way back to town.   CHAPTER XXV.

WE must go,back for a little to relate the circumstances that led to the change in his lordship's intentions, and to the consequent act of clemency which, had given Gerald Mostyn again to life. On the Saturday evening preceding, old priest Maraudey occupied the confessional of St. Andrew's, at Crucis. The shades of evening were gathering fast; the dim church was faintly lighted by the two wax tapers that burned before the great altar, and fell here and there upon the carved image of angel, saint, or martyr that filled the niches near; the old priest, hopeless of another penitent that night, was about to- rise and leave the church, when the sound of a hasty and faltering footstep near caused him to pause and resume his seat. And the next moment the curtain was put aside, and a man entered, and dropped rather than kneeled at the feet of the confessor. At first he did not speak, but the sound of his laboring lungs, and palpitating heart was audible through the stillness of the church.  He panted like a hunted beast at bay, or a fugitive- fallen exhausted in a flight for life.

"Mr. Maraudey, I regret very much that it does not lie within my prerogative to grant your request. The par- doning, commuting, and respiting power pertaining to the Crown, is only to be exercised under certain conditions, which really do not attend the present case.

"But, sir," said the priest, "are not one of the condi- tions of pardon an ascertained error in the verdict of -the jury, as, for instance, when the verdict of 'guilty'- has been pronounced upon a man afterwards discovered to be inno- cent?" "Assuredly; that is one of the most urgent reasons for the interference of the Crown." "Then, sir, that reason exists in the case of Mr. Mostyn."

Now it is a re. markable and lamentable fact, that among all the criminals that are annually condemned and hanged, there is never to be found a guilty man. They are all a set of the most deeply-injured innocents to be found on earth." "Sir, sir, this sarcasm sits not well upon the lips of your lordship," said the priest, in bitter sorrow. "Reverend sir, I am aware that it does not, and there- fore will answer you with due gravity, that I am sorry I am not able to receive either Mr. Mostyn's word, or your opinion, in proof of his innocence." "Sir, I offer you no mere opinions!

"Am I to understand, sir, that while admitting that you know the real murderer of Hugh Horne, you refuse- to divulge his identity?" "I do, sir." "Then it becomes my duty to arrest you, reverend sir," said the Minister, rising and touching the bell. A servant entered to answer the summons. "Go and request your master to come hither," said the Minister.

Then he examined Mr. Maraudey, who frankly told him all that had been related to the Minister; but refused to give any more particular information. But you would not for this cause send the good father to prison?" expostulated Colonel North. The Minister bowed. The magistrate shrugged his shoulders. "Oh, I do not mind --" began the priest. "Oh, if you ' do not mind,' that is another affair," said Colonel North, very dryly. Whereupon an officer was summoned, a warrant made out, and Mr. Maraudey com. mitted to the county jail.

Radnor House was a beautiful building of white stone, with porches running along the whole front from basement to roof. Behindi it arose a background of wooded mon.  tains. Before it fell the valley, rolling in undulating hills 'down to the banks of the rapid river. Externally the whole scene was radiant withfe and beauty, Pass the threshold of the house, and all was changed. Within a luxurious chamber of that sumptuous dwelling, Mrs. Horne, the mistress of the mansion, lay slowly expir- ing Thus she had lain many days, and thus she might lay many days longer, in a state that was neither life nor death. From the night of the murder of old Hugh Horne she had slowly failed. But so much of fitful gloom and eccen- tricity characterized her malady, that her friends did not scruple to ascribe her strange moods to partial insanity. While still living beneath the same roof with her hus. band, she entirely separated herself from him. Though, as long as she was able to do so, she had scrupulously fulfilled her duties as the mistress of his househoId, yet she had avoided his society and conversation. From the time of the arrest of Gerald Mostyn for the murder of Hugh Horne, her malady had greatly increased. She had watched the trial with intense and fearful interest. When, at length, she had heard of his conviction and sen. tence, she had sunk back fainting upon the bed, from which shewas destined never more to rise. And from this time her husband durst not even cross the threshold of her chamber, for at the sight of his face she invariably fell into violent convulsions, that threatened speedily to terminate her life. This seemed the more ex. traordinary as Dr. Horne had always enjoyed the repnta- tion of being a  constant and devoted husband, and Mrs. Borne had also the character of a fond and faithful wife. And no one could solve the mystery of this new and strange   THE .GIPSY'S   PROPHECY.      26B antagonism, or ascribe its existence to any other cause than monomania on the part of Mrs. Home. Her husband was constrained to avoid her apartment, where nothing but distress greeted his appearance. Her friends felt compelled to abandon a house so full of gloom and terror, where all evil influences seemed to congregate. Only Alice Owen, the gentle young nurse, remained faithful to the suffering lady., Since Dr. Horne had been obliged to absent himself, from her sight, his place as her physician had been filled by Francis Heath, whose wise and gentle ministrations, conjoined to those of Alice Owen, would have soothed and restored the unhappy lady, could any human power have saved her. But if the young physician, with his utmost skill and attention, did not succeed in doing more than alleviating his patient's sufferings, he did not fail to observe and ad- mire the disinterested devotion of the sweet young girl who, regardless of fatigue, day and night devoted herself, with saint-like patience, to the service of the sufferer. Day by day the beauty of her soul,'no less than the loveli- ness of her face and form, more and more deeply impressed his imagination and his heart. 'But he felt that the house of mourning was for every reason an improper place for his wooing, and thus it was that the love which had taken so deep root in his heart remained unspoken, though/not unrevealed; for it found a certain and intelligible expression in the softer glances of hts eyes, and the deeper tones of his voice, and the gentler deference in .his manner in addressing her And Alice knew that she. was beloved, and felt that she also loved4 ; and yet- so well- she guarded her ownseyes, and tones, and manner, that no sign of this reciprocity of feel- ing escaped her.

Francis Heath had known Alice Owen long enough, and, studied her character and disposition closely enough, to feel sure that she was all his heart could desire, or his rea- son' approve, in a wife, and he felt that he esteemed and loved her beyond all living women; yet, having resolved to delay his wooing to some more appropriate time and place, he confined himself to such deferential attentions as a gen- tleman might any where pay a lady. But our strong resolutions often give way to impulse or yield to circumstances. One morning the young physician, standing by the bed- 'tide of his patient, heard her murmur to herself- "What will become of Alice when I am gone?" "Aye, what indeed!" thought the doctor--" for after the death of her patroness, the world will not permit her to remain beneath the roof of a young widower, without any lady at the head of his house I What, then, will be. come of the -orphan girl? Who will receive her? Whither can she go? Ah I this question pressing upon my heart, changes my whole duty. I must have an explanation with her at once, so that when she withdraws from this roof, she will go forth, as my wife, to a home of her own." With these generous thoughts and purposes occupying his mind and heart, he left the chamber of his. patient, and went down into the lower hall. Providence seemed to favor his wishes. Contrary to her usual practice, Alice Owen had left the sick room, and was now standing at the parlor door, seemingly await- Ing the doctor, for as he appeared she beckoned him into the parlor, and begged him to satisfy her as to the present condition and future prospects of his patient.

Deeply distressed by this rejection, yet impressed by the exquisite delicacy with which it was worded, Dr. Heath remained for a few minutes silently regarding her. Then in faltering tones he asked-- "Alice, will you permit me to inquire why you have given me this answer?" " Yes. 'Pity,' they say, 'is kin to love.' You have seen me here, and compassionated my orphaned condition, and you call that love which is truly mercy," was the gentle reply. "Alice, listen to me.

Good-day, Dr. And swiftly and silently Is a light withdrawn, Alice disappeared from the room. It was a few hours after this that the newslof the respite of Gerald Mostyn reached Radnor, and was conveyed to rs.  orne. The poor sufferer smiled with delight on hearing the glad tidings, and for a few days she rallied. But her health was too far gone to admit hope of her ultimate recovery.        to     pe f her CHAPTER XXVII.

IF this true-hearted lover appeared, sent from Heaven for the future stay and support of her helpless orphanage, Alice had another suitor that seemed as surely sent from Hades for her torment and destruction. For month s past Alice had seen with shuddering fear that, whenever she chanced to be left alone with Dr Horne, he would invariably fix his eyes upon her with a sinister and dangerous meaning.

But great is the strength and perseverance of evil. In the lonely halls and passages he contrived to waylay and intercept the poor maiden, as she passed to and from the upper to the lower rooms; he would join her, walk by her side, take and press her hand, and drop words of admira- tion into her ears. At such times she would break from him in terror and flee away, ashamed, shuddering, and cowering, to the sanctuary of the sick room. But evil is hard to be repulsed. All her fear and horror of his admiration seemed but to add fuel to the fire of his passion. His pursuit grew more vigilant, artful, and persecuting.- It seemed impossible to avoid falling into the snares constantly and covertly laid for her destruction. She would have left the houseteven though it had been to perish in the wilderness, had it not been for the poor invalid who was so dependent on her care. But she secluded herself still more rigidly in the sick chamber. She took her slender meals there; she slept there on a sofa bedstead. And if any thing were wanted from below, she rang and made a servant bring it. Thus the poor fawn hoped to escape the hunter. Alas I how vainly I She should, at all cost to herself and others, have fled from that' house of pefil, for fruitless were all other means to save herself from evil., Onefatal dad y she fell into the snare set for her destruc- tion.

She had procured the article of which she had ame in search, and was about to leave the room, when the figure of Dr. orne, entering by the only door, arrested her as tonished sight a While she stood gazing upon him in a rt of panic, he quietly closed and locked the door and withdrew the key which he placed in his pocket, keeping his eyes upon his purposed victim all the while. With her own gaze fixed upon the ground, Aiice ad- vanced towards the fastened door, and placing her hand upon the knob of the latch, said, in constiained tones- Let me pass, if you please, Dr. Horne."

A chill of superstitious dread, inspired by the calm, cold cruelty of his threats, crept over the maiden as she re.- gained her friend's sick room. She adminitered thecor dial to the patient, adjusted her pillows, arranged her coverlid, made her otherwise comfortable, and then sat down to reflect. The scene that had just passed between Dr. Horne and herself, rendered it absolutely necessary that she should withdraw from the house. Her mind was now made up, and her plan arranged. She would write a note to her friend, rs. Osborne, re questing the shelter of her hospitable roof for a few days, until she could find another situation as lady's companion or seamstress. She would have this note ready for Francis Heath to convey to his sister. She lost no time in carrying her plan into execution and without hinting to her lover the reason why she wished to leave the house, she entrusted him with the letter to be delivered. Then she wrote a second note addressed to Dr. Eorne and warning him to seek the services of another attendant for his wife, as she was about to leave the house. This note received no manner of reply. But the next day, when Dr. Hesth arrived on his pro. Oessiona! visit, he brought with him a letter from Mrs. Osborne to Alice Owen, cordially offering to her a home in the parsonage for so long as sheshould see fit to favor its inmates with her presence. In addition to this Dr. ath It s        r   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY.      275 informed Alice that his horse and gig were at her orders to convey her to the parsonage. Alice was constrained to accept his kindness; and that very afternoon she packed up her little wardrobe and pre- pared to leave the house of evil. She took a tender leave of her almost unconscious patient, pressing kisses - on her cold brow, and charging her old nurse, Glenn, to watch and tend her carefully. Mrs. Glenn, who was lost in amazement at this sudden flitting of Alice, promised to do all that was required of her. Alice then went down into the hall where Francis Heath awaited to conduct her to the gig which was standing be- fore the door. Her lover lifted her in, carefully arranged her seat, drew the cover up over her lap, and then went to see that her trunk was well secured behind. During the few seconds that he was absent from her side upon this errand, Dr. Horne came out of the house up to the gig, and stooping to Alice's ear, whispered, so that no one but herself could hear- "You think that you have eluded me, fair saint-we shall see i"And having said this, he bowed pleasantly on meeting Francis Heath, and retired into the porch. Alice sank back in her seat, shuddering with a vague and terrible presentiment of some awful calamity at hand. "Why-will you permit me to ask--have you left your friend, my dear Alice?' inquired Francis Heath, as he gathered up the reins and started his horse. "Because," answered'Alice, evasively, "the trials of the situation were getting to %e too heavy for me; I should have fallen ill on their hands." ) "You might, indeed. I do not think that you have had a night's rest for many weeks past. I am glad that you have left."

As she continued silent, her lover spoke again-- "You will feel less regret in leaving your friend, from the fact that she has been much more composed in mind since she heard of the respite of Mr. Mostyn." "Yes," answered Alice, " it is wonderful how deeply she has been affected by the whole of that tragedy from first to last. No one felt the murder of old Mr. Horne so griev- ously as she did; and yet she was not nearly connected either by blood or friendship with the murdered or the murderer. How strange!" "Passing strangeI But, dear Alice, why did you say the murderer? Since the revelation made to the Minister by Mr. Maraudey many people believe Mr. Mostyn to be innocent." "t Oh! I would that they were right I I would that I, too, could believe that story 1 but, oh I sir, it can weigh nothing against the evidence of my own senses You know 'what I, myself, saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears 1" "But what, then, Alice, can you make of this story told by Mr. Maraudey?"  "I know not I -It may possibly be that the penitent in question was a madman, who only imagined what he told to Mr. Maraudey, or it may be that he was some devoted friend, more jealous than scrupulous, who took this way to save Mr. Mostyn. Has Mr. Maraudey yet given any clue to his identity i" "No; he was brought up yesterday, when, refusing to testify, he was committed for contempt. It is a matter of conscience with him, and it is really very doubtful whe. ther there is any law to bCompel him, in this case-to do so."

"He is at least likely to remain in prison a long time," said Dr. Reath. They were now beginning to descend the mountain; and the road was so difficult and dangerous, that her lover was compelled to give his whole attention to his horse, and the conversation ceased. When they had safely reached the foot of the pass, a few yards of level road under the shadow of the ridge brought them to the parsonage. CHAPTER XXVIII.

"There! rest, dear Alice," he said, "you have tended others so long, that nowyou must in your turn be cared for." "This is, indeed, like the repose of paradise," said Alice, as she yielded herself up to the comforts of her position. Dr. Heath mended the fire, and smiled at his guest.

Then she brought the crystal lump-sugar,mthe rich cream, the light biscuits, and the, golden, fresh, butter, and set them in -order upon the board. Her mistress went to the parlor cupboard, and produced her store of preserves and cakes. The clear, crimson currant-jelly, the golden pomegranate, the ruby quince, the emerald citron sweet- meats, rich queen cakes, delicate lady-fingers, and fragrant crullers--all the work of her own hands, were arranged i cut-glass saucers, or silverfligree baskets, and placed npon the table. "ShallUI fetch the tea-urn, now, madam?" inquired the little maiden. "No, Eetty, not just yet; we must wait a few moments for Mr. Osborne. He rode over to Llyndell, Alice, to see the old lady," said Mrs. Osborne, as she took a seat near her guest. Then there followed some kind inquiries as to the present condition ofthe suffering invalid at Radnor. "You go out so little, Alice, that you do not hear as much as I do.

And you are not to take another situation or leave us at all any more, until you leave us as my brother's wife, to take the head of his establishment. Alice blushed with mingled emotions of grateful joy and girlish shame, while her lover turned upon his sister and herself a beaming smile of pleasure. "And now we will not wait another moment for Mr Osborne, who, ten to one, is taking tea with the Llyndell ladies.

Chairs were set, and at the-invitation of the hostess, the little circle of three gathered around the board. "You take black tea, I  believe, Alice.

Tea always tastes better when he is at the table," said the affectionate wife, as she put sugar and cream into a fourth cup, ready to-fill up.

"What degradation!" exclaimed Mrs. Osborne, bitterly. "Not at all, mum--not at all.

"Oh, I forgot; here it is," said Alice, producing it from her pocket. The officer knelt and unlocked the trunk. A poor but clean and neatly folded wardrobe was all that the lifting of the lid revealed.

And no persuasion would induce her to change her pur- pose. "Well, she is the obstinatest l" said the constable, as he supported her from the house to the chaise that was waiting to take her to the magistrate's office., "You will tell him that I am innocent, but that he must resign me," said Alice, turning an appealing gaze upon her friend. "He needs not to be told that you are innocent, and he will never forsake you. I will send for him immediately; he will lose no time in following you," replied Mrs. Osborne, in a voice broken by angnish, as she pressed the poor girl to her bosom before resigning her to the care of the officer. And the next moment Alice was lifted into the chaise, which was driven rapidly away. "Oh, surely this is some horrible dream!" said Mrs. Osborne, with a shudder, as she returned to the house, for- getting in her great trouble even to shake off the snow that whitened all her dress. She lost not a moment in despatching a messenger with the following note to Llyndell:- "Alide Owen has just been arrested upon a charge of grand larceny. For heaven's sake, as soon as you can leave Mrs. Horton, hasten hither." Francis Heath was standing at the bedside of his patient when that note was put i to his hand. He glanced over it, passed his hand before his eyes as if to clear his vision, read it again, flushed, grew pale; seized his hat, and, without a word of explanation, hurried from the house, leaving the astonished family to suppose that some patient in the:last extremity nad summoned him away.

A long, dismal, and dangerous drive brought them at length to Gwyn, and to the. house of SquireJessup. A single light shone through a window in the, little wing now used by the squire as his office. Before this wing the chaise stopped.. The driver left his seat, and -the policeman alighted and handed out Alice, -.and led her,- half palsied with cold and terror, into the office. The magistrate was seated at his table, and near him also sat Dr. Horne. As the: eyes of the squire fell upon Alice, where she stood, covered-with sleet, and half fainting with shame, and grief, and fear, he could not forbear turning upon her accuser a questioning and rebuking look, as though he would have asked  "Why force this fragile creature out on such a-bitter night as this? "  Dr. Horne understood the tacit inquiry, and answered, as if it had been uttered-- , You will remember the great value of the articles pur- loined, and the -urgent necessity of haste in order to recover them. Hence the need of this prompt arrest." "Draw forward that leathern chair, McNab," said Mr. Jessup, addressing the constable. And when the man had obeyed, he turned to Alice, and said-- "'Sit down, young woman."

"Ah," sighed Dr. Horne, "it is with the deepest pain that I appear here -as her accuser. Nothing but despair of reforming her by moral suasion-nothing but the necessity of giving her a sharp lesson-(for this is not her 'first offence)7-nothing, in short, but a strong sense of duty -could have constrained me to prosecute her." The justice looked at the pale girl before him, and groaned for pity. "I am innocent, indeed, sir, I am," said poor Alice, clasping her hands, and raising her eyes pleadingly to the magistrate's face. "Poor child I= God grant you may be proved so!" said the squire. "Did your worship, in your official career, ever happen to meet with any one who was -guilty?" sneeringly inquired Dr. Horne. The magistrate did not notice the sarcasm; his eyes were fixed upon Alice Owen. "You found the casket?" inquired the doctor of the policeman. "Yes, sir." "Where?" "In her trunk." "Very well--Mr. Jessup, what are we waiting for?" asked the accuser, impatiently, addressing the squire. "Nothing, sir; I am-ready to proceed with the case if the prisoner is ready; but she has no defence," said the magistrate. "Nor I any advocate; we stand upon equal terms,'! answered the accuser. Very unwillingly the' magistrate proceeded with his Officee.   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        298' Dr. Horne being sworn, deposed that Alice Owen had, lived in his house, as the companion of his wife, for more' than a year; that, during the last few months, he had missed many articles which had been traced to her posses- sion; that upon he, apparent repentance, he had frequently' forgiven her i but that, finding her perfectly incorrigible, he had, at length, warned her to leave his house; that even then, wishing to shield her reputation, and so give her a chance of reform, he had, in discharging, forborne to accuse her, so that no one had reason to suppose that she had been dismissed, or had left the house at any other than her own will; that soon after her departure, he-had chanced to open a bureau, in which the most valuable articles of family jewelry were kept, and missing his wife's casket of pearls, had naturally suspected Alice Owen of the theft, and immediately made a requisition for a search-warrant; and that, in justification of' his proceeding, he begged the magistrate to swear and examine the constable'who had served the warrant. The officer being -sworn, deposed to the finding of the casket of jewels in the possession of the accused. The magistrate, whose first instinctive belief in Alice Owen's innocence now yielded to the force of evidence against her, turned towards her a countenance as full of sorrow as of severity, and inquired- "What have youtos to   this charge, young woman?"

"How do you: suppose, then, that it came into your trunk 7" The face of the young girl crimsoned with blushes; she did not reply. "If you can explain how it came there without your knowledge or connivance, you had better do so," said the squire. The poor girl struggled bravely against the overwhelm- ing sense of shame that crushed her spirit to the dust, as, amid burning blushes, she answered- "Sir, I may not be able to prove the- fact, but I think they were put there by Dr. Horne, with the view to destroy me.  "Young woman I beware how you try to criminate a gentleman of Dr. Horne's indisputable integrity!l" ex- claimed the magistrate, indignant at what he supposed to be the base artifice of the accused. "It is like her 1" said Dr. Horne, coolly. "What motive, pray, Miss Owen, could you suppose Dr.-IBorne to possess for injuring you?" Alice strove more strenuously against the crushing sense of shame, and her cheeks, and brow, and neck were flushed with still-more fiery blushes, as she answered-- "I must speak the truth, come what will of it, sir. This man, once my employer and now my accuser, pursued me with a sinful suit, threatening to destroy me if---" Unable to complete the painful sentence, Alice dropped her face in both her hands, and shuddered as with an ague. This action, that was indeed the effect of maiden modesty, looked so like conscious guilt, that the magistrate gazed upon her with his brows knit into the severest frown. :'It is precisely like all her conduct,;' said Dr. Horme   rHE; i -GI PSY'S 'PROPHECOT.    29O: "on will now have an opportunity of witnessing that girl's double-distilled duplicity." "Young woman," said the magistrate, sternly, "when you were first brought before me, your tender years and- well, yes-your refined loqks, rather inclined me to think too leniently of your case, and to criticise too hastily the course of your accuser. The: wickedness with which you have endeavored to shield yourself by criminating a gentle- man of Dr. Horne's unimpeachable character has convinced me that you are one with whom it will not do to deal gently. The evidence against you is also convicting, and obliges me to bind you over for trial to appear at the as- sizes. Have you bail?" "Sir?" asked Alice, lifting her now -pale face from her hands. "I ask you, have you bail?" "I do not understand you, sir," said the poor girltto whom the forms of law were incomprehensible. The magistrate explained what was needed. For a moment her face brightened. She thought of her lover, and how readily he would become her surety; but the beam was very transient; it passed away as she re- solved to refrain from mentioning his name, lest theoun- merited shame that had fallen upon her should be reflected upon him. "I have no bail, sir," she answered. "Have you really no friend to whom you could, apply in this emergency?" inquired the magistrate, who, against what he considered his " better judgment," was again be- ginning to pity her. "I have none to whom I would be willing to apply, sir." "Then you know what follows; I shall be obliged to commit -you to prison."  f A loww,-despairing cry, broke from Alice, as again she dropped her face upon her hands.  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7861-00000139"/> 9j8    THTE  GIIP SY'S PROPMECT.

Alice did not speak or look up again, but remained with her face buried in her hands until the magistrate had put the warrant in the hands of the constable, and he had touched her shoulder, saying- "Come, young woman, the sooner you get under shelter now the better."  But again one of those failing moods came over her, and losing all her strength, she sank to the floor. At first this was treated as affectation, and the stern voice of the magis- trate commanded the constable-   -- "Set her upon her feet and take her away I She is ohly acting l" But when that officer attempted to obey, he found her white and cold, and rigid as marble. Restoratives were resorted to. Kneeling beside her, the constable rubbed her forehead, temples, and the palms of her hands with hartshorn, while the magistrate produced from his private cupboard. a little good brandy, kept for such emergencies, and forced a teaspoonful into her mouth. These powerful means at length aroused her, so that she was able to be lifted upon her feet, and conducted between the two con-, stables to the chaise. A very short drive took them to the prison gates. Old Mr. Wardour was summoned, and the warrant put in his hands. "And here is your prisoner," said the constable, lifting Alice from the chaise and placing her, half-dying, upon her feet. He had to start and catch her-to keep her from falling. "She has a habit of fainting," said the officer, as he half supported and half dragged her towards the door of the jail. Jal.

"And now, my dear, I am going to put you in good company; in a cell in the upper lobby, near Mr. Maraudey and Mr. Mostyn.

As they passed between the 'row of dark and vacant cells, they saw lights gleaming from the two opposite ones at the extreme end of the lobby.

Good-night, and God bless you, child," said the jailer, shutting the door, and softly turning the key. He then took a step further that brought him opposite to Mr. Maraudey's cell; he peeped through the grating and saw the old man on his knees before a crucifix. "That's all very well," said the jailer to himself--" but it would be a heap better if you'd only give up the name of that malefactor, as Mr. Mostyn is a suffering for!" Having delivered himself of this sentiment, the worthy jailer crossed the lobby to Gerald Mostyn's cell. CHAPTER XXX.

But- Mr. Wardour rapped. '- Come in, good friend," said the sweet voice of the lady, as she recognized the rap of the jailer. He opened the door and entered. The cell had quite changed its aspect since the respite of' Mr, Mostyn. Constance had said cheerfully that since he was destined to lodge there for an indefinite period, it behoved her to make the little nook habitable. With the permission of the authorities, who could not refuse a lady- so   THE' GIPSY'S PROPHECY.         299 harmless a favor, she had had the cell thoroughly cleaned and white-washed. The narrow floor was covered with a strip of neat carpet; a small, neat bedstead, with's spring mattrass, clean linen and woolen coverings, and a warm counterpane, was placed in one corner; an imported coal- stove in another; a small stand with toilet fixtures in a third; and an easy-chair, covered with crimson cloth, nearly filled the remaining space. Little crimson merino and white muslin curtains concealed the bars of both the window and the door. On the wall opposite the bed three little hanging shelves supported a small collection of books. Each side, and also above this shelf, hung three small prints -that on the left, the Crucifixion-that on the right, the Resurrection-that above, the Ascension. If any caviller object that these comforts were unbefitting the place and the occasion, let such an one know that since the half-disclosures of the priest that had necessitated the indefinite respite of the prisoner, the rigor of the prison discipline had, by the order of the authorities, been some- what relaxed in his behalf. And besides, to obtain thesethings for him, Constance had sacrificed a personal ornament and convenience-her diamond-studded gold watch-whose price had paid for the fitting up and furnishing of the cell. By the kind sufferance of the jailer, Constance now spent much time, evening as well as morning, in her husband's cell. When Mr. Wardour, in compliance with her request, now entered, he found-Mr. Mostyn seated upon the side of the bedstead, reading to Constance, who, occupying the only chair, was engaged inm some delicate needlework. A safety-lamp sitting upon the little stand sufficiently lighted the cell.   ^ Mr. Mostyn immediately laid aside his book, and invited his visitor to accept the only seat he could offer him--the foot of the bed. /     *'  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7861-00000141"/> Or1   .THE GIPSY'S PROPHECY.

"Who is she?" inquired Constance, looking up from her sewing. "Alice. Owen, the very girl as was the principal witness against your husband; although I'm here asking you to see after her, knowing as how you return good for evil." "Alice Owen I in the name of all that is incomprehensi- ble, how came she hither?" exclaimed Constance, in amazement, while Mfr. Mostyn looked p,nd listened with fixed attention.

"But of what, then, is the poor girl accused?" inquired Mr. Mostyn. "Theft, sir; grand larceny, sir; that which will send her to prison for ten years, sir, if it's proved against her." "Good heaven 1" exclaimed both Gerald and Constance, in a breath. "Yes, sir-yes, ma'am, that is it; the poor thing seems perfectly stupified by her condition.

"I promise you," said Constance. And with this pledge the good jailer departed. After a little conversation between the husband and wife upon the subject of Alice's arrest, Constance rapped for Tom Turner to let her out, and crossed the lobby to the girl's cell. Looking through the grating, she dimly saw Alice sitting on the side of her cot, with her hands clasped upon her knees, and her eyes wildly staring into vacancy. Constance rapped and called softly- "Alice-Alice Owen." "Who wants me?" answered the poor girl, in a tremb- ling voice. "Your friend, Mrs. Mostyn. May I come in and see you?" "As you please, lady." Tom Turner softly turned the key, and- Constance en- tered, and sitting down beside Alice, silently embraced and kissed her. For the first time since her sudden arrest, Alice burst into tears, and dropping her head upon the lady's shoulder, wept sorely. Constance gently soothed her with tender caresses and comforting words, until at length Alice recovered her power of speech, and between choking sobs, exclaimed- "You--you come to me in prison, lady; you. embrace me, and kiss me, and console me--me who swore away your husband's life 1"  "N6, poor Alice, you did not.

Ah, lady-sweet lady I how can you endure the sight of me, much less forgive me, and come to me, and caress and comfort me?" "Because, poor Alice, neither myself nor my honored husband can be so unjust as to blame you for that testimony, or so unfeeling as not to compassionate your present con- dition. Your evidence, poor girl, was given most reluc. tantly, as every one saw." "Oh, it was-indeed it was I I tried to escape the subpoena." "We know that; we also know that your testimony was given in good faith, however mistaken it was." "And, oh, lady, do you know that since yesterday I be- gin to believe that I might have been mistaken?" "Anid we know that you were so, dear Alice; but what, then, has raised the doubt in your mind?" "Just this, madam-my own condition. Lady, look at me. I, even 'I,-,stand committed here upon a charge of grand larceny, supported by proof that must inevitably convict and send me to prison, unless some miracle of Di- vine Providence should intervene. The testimony that convicted Mr. Mostyn was not stronger than that which will convict me; and yet I am as innocent of felony as the babe unborn, and so, also, I begin to think Mr. Mostyn may well be, notwithstanding the testimony." And he is, dear girl, he is; and his innocence shall yet shine forth as the sun at noon-day. But tell me, Alice, the circumstances that led to your arrest." "Lady, I will; but before I begin-the strange, sorrowful, shameful story, it is but fair to tell you that I can bring no proof whatever of its authenticity, and that it received no credit whatever at the office of the magistrate. Therefore you must reject or receive it, lady, only upon my own as- sertion." "Alice, I have not now to learn for the first tin 3      THEE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.

Constance listened with ever-increasing horror and amazement; and when Alice had concluded her story, the lady remained in deep and silent thought. "There, madam, there are the facts, unsustained by proof; I know not whether you can credit the statement," said the poor, maiden, hesitatingly. ' Alice, yes, at least I credit your sincerity.

"Yes, I do, my poor girl; that is, I believe in your innocence and truthfulness. I have never known Dr. Horne intimately enough to have any personal knowledge of his character; but for years I have known him by reputation as a man of indubitable integrity--of unimpeachable honor -and, therefore, I hope there may be some great error in this affair that investigation may rectify.

WHLE these events were transpiring in the jail, Dr. Heath,-riding at full speed, entered the village, nor drew rein until he reached the magistrate's office. But it was closed up and darkened. He alighted, walked up to the principal entrance of the dwelling-house, and knocked loudly. A footman in livery opened the door. "Has your master retired?" inquired the doctor. "'No, sir; but' " and the footman paused in embar- rassment. "' Then take him my card, and say that I entreat him to favor me with a short interview," urged the doctor. "Yes, sir; but " and the servant again hesitated. "But do my errand, friend," insisted Dr. Heath, slipping aterown into the hand of the man, an argument that never yet failed with that functionary, who bowed and disappeared' within the house. Dr. Heath remained anxionsly waiting at the door until   THE- GIPSY S 'PROPHECY.        05 the -footman returned, inviting the visitor to follow him, and led the way to a door at the extremity of the hall, which he opened, announcing-  "Dr. Heath."' The young doctor found himself in an elegantly-furnished and-well lighted library, where the worthy magistrate, in dressing-gown and slippers, reposed himself in an easy- chair, before a glowing coal fire, and beside a luxurious' table, lazily enjoying his solitary bachelor supper. He slowly arose as his visitor entered, saying, as he held out his hand- "Welcome, Frank!

"Pooh I give away jewels worth fifteen hundred pounds to her young nurse without even consulting her husband? Preposterous I Besides, the girl herself never entered such a plea as that." "Still there is some mistake. There must be some mis- take, since it is utterly out of question that Alice Owen could have been guilty of theft," insisted the young doctor. ( Nonsense I But I see how it is; you were the attend- ant physician of Mrs. Horne, and were necessarily thrown much in the society of her pretty young nurse, whose dark eyes have made some impression upon you as-yes, I will confess it-they did upon me.

Heaven knows, I believe it would be a saving in the end," said the squire, washing down the sentiment with a huge bumper of claret. Dr. Heath was about to reply, when -the magistrate fore- stalled him by adding- "Now, -this girl, she knows she is beautiful, as I said before; and she knows that she would wear pearls with as much grace as any countess in the kingdom. Her mistress is ill, the jewel casket is in her way, vanity and opportunity are too strong for her honesty, and she appropriates the pearls which- she thinks would grace so well her own dark hair; and you see the fatal result. Bah I my young friend, it is a common case. Take your wine." "It may be a common case, sir, but it is not the case with Alice Owen.

"Pooh, pooh, my young friendl if you had been a magistrate thirty years, as I have been, you would have more experience in human frailty, and less faith in fair faces.

He replied, evasively- "I understand you, sir, and I hope you will rest satisfied with the assurance that my interest in this young lady 'arises from no improper or unchristian motives. I have known her long, and most favorably, and I would pledge -my own honor for her spotless integrity. She is an orphan, destitute alike of money or friends. I came hither with the purpose of serving her in the best manner that I may." "And what do you wish to do, then?" To offer bail for her appearance at court. You know r my-responsibility, I suppose, and will not object to take me for any sum that may be necessary-aye I to the whole extent of my property, if required." "Pooh," said the magistrate, "much less than that will do. I will have her brought up again to-morrow, when you can enter into a recognizance for her appearance at the assizes." "But to-night-cannot the business be concluded to- night?" inquired the young iman, anxiously. "At this hour:? Preposterous I impossible!" replied the justice in a tone -that admitted of no dispute.

And as a parting advice, I counsel you not to become too deeply interested in the young girl you wish to serve. A pretty girl is a dangerous sort of a protegd for a young gentleman," said the magistrate, as, he arose to dismiss his visitor. With an agreement to meet the magistrate at twelve o'clock the next day, Frank took leave and departed from the house. He found his horse, that had been refreshed by a feed and a rest, held by a groom at the gate. Throwing the man a half-crown, he got into his saddle, and turned his horse's head down the street. He passed the dark and massive front of the jail on the other side of the way, and his heart bled to think of Alice a prisoner within its gloomy walls. Late as it was, he took the road leading back to the parsonage. CHAPTEER XXXII.

Mrs. Osborne, a careful housewife, was an habitual early riser; and this morning, having a busy day before her in anticipation of the bishop's visit, she was up earlier than usual. Hearing from the servants that her brother had got 'home at daybreak, and was waiting to see her in the library, she repaired thither. On opening the door, she was so struck with the pale, worn, and anxious expression of his countenance, that,  forgetting for the moment all other anxieties, she ex- claimed- "Francis, you will kill yourself. You have spent the whole night on horseback, and ridden to Gwyn and back since tea-time yesterday." "My dear sister, you do not inquire about poor Alice," said the young man. a Yes, I do; I have not slept a wink all night for think- ing of her-and of the bishop's visit. What about her? Where have you left her?" "In the county jail," he replied, gravely. "In the county jail!" she exclaimed, turning very pale, sinking into a chair,' and gazing in dismay upon her brother. "Yes, in the county jail. "I "Oh, Heavens, what a misfortune I and what a mortifi- cation to all her friends. Have you seen her?"

"What he thought of her case is shown in his act. He committed her to prison. Magistrates always act upon evidence rather than upon character." "And what can be done for the poor girl?" "Nothing before eleven o'clock to-day. I offered bail last night, but it was too late for any thing to be done. I appointed to meet the magistrate at eleven to-day to enter into a recognizance with poor Alice for her appearance at court. And then I rode off hither to tell you the result, as well as to send a bottle of medicine to Mrs. Horton, whom I shall not be able to visit." "But you are really not in earnest in riding back to Gwyn this morning?"- "Most certainly I shall keep my appointment with the magistrate.  I will not leave poor Alice in prison one mo- ment longer than I can'possibly help." "But your horse must be-quite exhausted as well as yourself;" expostulated his sister.

It was your own proposal!" said the young physician, in surprise and vexa- tion. "Yes, Frank, but that was before this shocking affair took place. That was when no one could say any thing against her character, whatever they might say against her birth and position. And I did it, Frank, for your sake. But if you wish me to be perfectly candid with you, I never did quite approve of your marrying Alice Owen; though, as she was amiable and accomplished, I was inclined to look over the objection of her low birth; and as you were resolved to marry her, I invited her here, so that she might not discredit the connection by/taking another situation. And I treated her with affection, and tried -to like her-not a difficult task, for she seemed the sweetest creature I ever saw. - That I admit; but of course all that is over now. You could never think of keeping your engagement with her, and discrediting your family by marrying a girl that has been accused of theft? Nor can I, a clergyman's wife, consent to receive her here again," said Mrs. Osborne, ex- citedly, while avoiding the fixed, rebuking glance, of -her truer-hearted brother. "Sister, how can you be so unfeeling as to desert an in- nocent, unhappy girl, a poor, friendless, homeless orphan, in the time of her bitterest need?" he inquired, in a voice trembling with emotion. "I am not unfeeling," said Mrs. Osborne, with the tears swelling to her eyes. "I am not unfeeling. I am sure I am as sorry for Alice as I -can possibly be.

Why, people will think that we have got irrecoverably mixed up with a set of felons!" said the lady with a shiver. "But poor Alice is no felon. She is yet unconvicted. And you should know, in your heart, that she-is perfectly innocent.  "I believe she is innocent-that is, H hope she is inno- cent-and I hope it will be proved so; but, after all, what can I know of it? The magistrate is wiser than I am, and he believed her guilty, and committed her for trial. And, after all, innocent or guilty, the stigma of her arrest and trial for theft will cleave to her and all connected with her for ever, and you know it; and you know that I cannot, upon that account, receive he-f at the parsonage again. And if I could, Mr. Osborne would not." "Sister, you know that your husband will consent to any  thing you wish." "Then the greater reason why I should not ask him to', consent to any thing that might injure him as-a clergy- man," said the lady. "Then you absolutely refuse to shelter this innocent and most injured girl?"   "I am absolutely forced to do so, from my sense of duty," said Mrs. Osborne.

"'Now, you are unreasonably angry, Frank. -But I am really interested in the fate of the poor girl, though I could not possibly receive her as an inmate of my family; and I am very anxions that when she is released from prison, and while she is awaiting her trial, she should be properly taken- care of," urged the lady, in full sincerity. "Give yourself no uneasiness upon Alice Owen's ac- count, Mrs. Osborne.

There remained about two hours before he could meet Alice at the magistrate's office. His first care was, therefore, to have his horse put up at the village hotel. He next paid a visit to the office of the registrar, where he transacted some business, of which more anon. And, finally, he went over the way to the modest village house that he-had engaged as his office and bachelor dwelling, and directed the old woman in charge there to open and air the rooms., When these preliminaries had been arranged, as it was now a quarter to twelve o'clock, he bent his steps towards the prison to visit Alice and accompany her to the magis- trate's office to arrange for her release.

"Oh, yes, sir, that poor child! Well, just wait in the office a moment, until I go and see whether she is prepared to receive a visitor," said the jailer, showing the young man into the appointed place, and starting off to do his errand. "An instant, Mr. Wardour, if you please. It is proper, since I make this visit, to inform you that the young lady, who is to be its recipient, is my own betrothed wife. Having said this much, I need, not add that she is entirely guiltless of that which is falsely and cruelly laid to her charge," said the loyal-hearted young man, as he detained the jailer for a few seconds to hear this explanation. "Really, sir, I believed her innocent from the first! and indeed people ought to be made to suffer for bringing groundless charges," said the jailer, as he hastened away After an absence of five minutes, he returned, saying- "You can come up now, sir. I found Mrs. Mostyn with her when I first went up, but now the lady has retired, and the girl is alone. Follow me, sir."' Francis Heath obeyed, and the jailer conducted him to the upper lobby, and to the door of Alice's cell, where he left him.  -          O When he entered, he found her sitting upon the side of ler cot, her head dropped upon her bosom, her hands clasped upon her lap, and her eyes fixed upon the floor.

Alice put on her little black bonnet and shawl, and turned to follow her guides. But Dr. Heath drew her arm within his own, and, guarded by the constables, led her from the prison cell, down through the lobby-and the staircase, and out into the open air. "Now, dear one, you have: taken your leave of those gloomy walls forever; and not for one-moment should you have abided within them could I have reached here in time to have become your surety last night," said.

And the'magistrate signified that the pris- ,oner and her surety were at liberty to withdraw. "Come, my dear Alice," whispered Francis Heath, as he drew her arm within his own and led her from the office. Alice looked up in his face with an expression of helpless, hopeless misery, that seemed to ask- "What shall I do? Whither can I go?" There was a close carriage standing at the corner of the street, apparently awaiting orders. Dr. Heath made a signal to the coachman, and the carriage immediately ad- vanced and drew up before the office. Dr. Heath opened the door, and holding it open, he said-- "G et in, dear Alice, and I will explain afterwards." Alice, with an appealing gaze of utter helplessness and perfect trust, obeyed. Dr. Heath paused a moment to direct the coachman, in a low voice, to drive to Gwyn Old Church, that-was situ- ated in the eastern suburbs of 'the town, and then entered the carriage and took his seat beside Alice. They rode on in silence for a few minutes, Dr. Heath apparently plunged in deep thought, and Alice watching his countenance in anxious affection. At last she sum- moned courage to asks- "Where are you taking me, Dr. Heath? Not back to the parsonage, I hope. ' Oh, no I I should but be an em- barrassment to your dear sister." "No, sweet Alice, I am not taking you back to the parsonage. It is full of company by this time, drawn together to meet the bishop, and no place for my 'stricken deer,"' replied Francis Heath, tenderly.  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7861-00000152"/> U.:2  t THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY. ' "'Where, then; where, then, are you taking me;, 'Di. Heath? Ah, do not embarrass yourself with one so utterly and irretrievably lost as myself. Listen. I have thirty shillings left. For that money some poor cottager might receive me for the few days that must intervene before my trial-and then-" She paused and grew pale. "And then, Alice, what then?" asked the young man, tenderly tking her hand. "The Lord will take care of the rest," she said, in a low and reverent tone. "He will; but He works by human means, sweet girl. Listen to me, my love. Alice, you have neither father nor mother, sister nor brother, nor even uncle, aunt, or cousin. ,You are a desolate and helpless orphan. You have no near friend but myself, your lover.

"Oh, Francis I Francis I it is almost worth while to be in such a desperate strait to find so true a friend," said the orphan, in a voice vibrating with passionate earnestness. "'Actions speak. louder than words,? and more to the purpose,' he continued; "and what I have said to you in set terms, I must say to the world in more significant acts. I have told you that I know you to be innocent. In a more practical manner I must tell the world so, by making you my wife." "Oh, Francis! Francis! I thank you from my heart and soul for this most noble faith I But think you I would now link my wretched lot with yours? No; Francis, no I Do not ask me!"' "My own Alice, I have not asked you.

It would be wrong I do not tempt me to do such wrong; I am not strong enough to resist; I have been so terrified and weakened; I am not fit to be your wife; I am but a poor, hunted, cowering hare, whose only wish is to creep away to some quiet spot anddie in peace. Find me only such a place, good friend; -then go and leave me to my fate," muttered Alice, in a voice vibrating with emotion, while the tears streamed down her face. He gathered her tenderly to his bosom, wiped the tears from her eyes, stopped her further words with kisses, and laid her back among the cushions for a moment, while he searched in his pocket, and drew forth a paper, which he exhibited to her, saying--  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7861-00000153"/> 8924    THE  GIPS'Y'S P-ROPHECY. "This, Alice, is our marriage licence. Before coming to you this morning, I went to the registrar's office and pro- cured it; for I had resolved not to make my appearance before you without it. I then spoke to Mr. Miles, the curate, who officiates at Gwyn Old Church, to meet us there with his two sisters to act as witnesses to our mar- riage. They none of them know any thing of you or your misfortunes, so that you need not shrink from seeing them." By this time the carriage had drawn up before the entrance of the churchyard. Dr. Heath alighted and handed out his companion, and drawing her arm within his own, led her into the church. The curate, an old man, with thin, white hair, was already in his place, attended only by the parish clerk. Two elderly ladies, his sisters, were seated in a front pew, waiting to render the assistance required of them. These four persons were the only occupants of the church atcthe moment that Dr. Heath, with Alice Owen on his arm, entered the aisle. He led his bride up before the altar, and named her to the curate and the two elderly ladies, who immediately joined the group, The marriage ceremony commenced; the parish clerk gave away the bride, and at the close of the- service the small party adjourned to the vestry to witness the registry of the marriage. When these forms were over, the usual congratulations were tendered and accepted, the old curate was made :happy in the possession of the largest fee he had ever re- ceived, Dr. Heath drew the arm of Alice within his own, and led her from the church. He placed her in the carriage, stopped as before to direct the coachman where to drive, then entered and seated him. self by her side. "You are my own Alice, now, whose honor and reputa-   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        325 tion I will protect and defend against the whole world," he whispered, drawing her to his faithful bosom, upon which she dropped her young head, weeping strange tears of mingled sorrow and joy--sorrow at the remembrance of the dark fate that still threatened her, joy in the possession of the noble heart which had become her shelter.    * A half-hour's drive brought them to the centre of the town. As they drove down the long street they passed the gloomy front of the prison from which Alice had been so recently released. She shuddered as she saw the building, and then, as if suddenly remembering the fact, she said-- "Oh, I did not take leave of Mrs. Mostyn, who was so good to me.  Does she know?" "She knows nothing as yet, dear Alice, but that you have been released on bail; but before night she shall know every thing, fort wish her to come to you as soon as may be," replied Dr. Heath. The carriage passed on down the street, and drew up on the opposite side of the way, before a modest two-story stone house, having a central door, with a window each side, and three windows above. :- A small yard, filled with evergreen shrubbery, separated it from the street. The doctor alighted, handed out Alice, and  led her through the green wooden gate, and up to the house. fle  knocked, and a matronly woman, neatly dressed, opened the door and curtsied. "This is my   wife, your mistress, Martin," said the doctor, as he led Alice ic. The woman curtsied again, opened a second door in the right side of the passage, and admitted them into a .lean, cheerful, plainly-furnished  parlor, where -a bright fire glowed and a  table was laid.  "You are so exhausted with all the excitement you have gone through-let me take your bonnet and shawl off here,- dear-Alice, and do you rest on this sofa until you have re- 24  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7861-00000154"/> Vff    THE  GIPSY'S?ROPHECY. covered yourself," said Dr. Heath, tenderly removing her wrappings, which he gave to the old servant, who took them from the room, and then drawing forward a soft sofa, upon which he persuaded- her to repose for a few minutes while breakfast was brought in. As soon as the servant was gone, he bent over her pale face, and kissing her tenderly, said- "This is your home, dear Alice. Let me make you most welcome to it." Alice blessed him with her soft, dark eyes, and then ex- r pressed some surprise that this " home" should have been so ready for them. "Sweet Alice, it is not half ready. There are but three rooms furnished in it-this parlor, a chamber immediately above it, and a kitchen behind it. There is not even accom- modation for Martin, who is obliged to leave every-night and return. She has a key to -let herself into the kitchen. You must know that I took the house just as it was given up by my predecessor, Mr. Thorpe, who sold me his med- ical practice here. He was an eccentric bachelor, who kept no company, and furnished no more rooms than were absolutely necessary to his own accommodation.  His oddities made him unpopular, and his unpopularity made him hate the place. So he sold his small practice and his establishment here even below its value, and took himself and his eccentricities off to India. I hope to do better; to have a larger practice, as well as a better furnished house;' said Francis Heath, smiling. Martin, now entered with coffee, toast, boiled eggs, broiled ham and chicken, which she neatly arranged upon the table. Dr. Heath led Alice to the table, and selecting for her plate the most delicate morsels on the board, pressed her to partake of them, When breakfast was over, he seated her comfortably in b-,   THE  GIPS-Y'S PROPHECY       82 an easy-chair, put a footstool under her feet, placed ans illustrated volume of Shakspeare on the stand beside her, and then said- "I have one or two of Thorpe's permanent patients, chronic hypochondriacs, to see to-day, dear Alice, so I must even leave you for an hour or two. I will call and ask Mrs. Mostyn to come to you for a little while. Do not think, dearest; make yourself comfortable, read, do any thing rather than think, while I am away." And kissing her tenderly, and bidding her trust in Heaven, Dr. Heath withdrew, and left the house. In passing the jail, he stopped at the dwelling-house of the warden, where he remembered that MrS. Mostyn was lodging. . He went in at the gate, knocked, and inquired for the lady. He was told that she was at home, and was shown into a parlor, where Constance soon joined him, holding out her hand as she entered, and exclaiming- "Oh, I am so glad you called; I wished so 'much to hear of that poor child. She is released from confinement upon your recognizance, I know. But where is she now? wha't refuge has she in her great distress?" "The refuge of her husband's heart and home, Mrs. Mostyn. I have this morning made Alice Owen my wife;" said Dr. Heath, gravely. "Is it possible?" exclaimed Constance, in astonishment. Francis Heath bowed gravely, adding- "I took her from the magistrate's office to the church." Constance gazed in surprise at an act of self-devotion and moral heroism of which, until now, she had thought only woman capable, and then her glorious fae became suddenly radiant with enthusiastic admiration; and, advancing towards him she exclaimed, fervently-' "It was nobly done; give me your hand, Francis Heath. It was nobly, nobly done. God bless you 1:' She cordially pressed the hand that he had extended to  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7861-00000155"/> :8H'    TTISE GIPSY'S  PRO9PHE'CY.- hter, reteased it and sat down. Still regarding him with eyes full 'of generous sympathy, she inquired- "Your friends, Dr. Heath, how will they regard this act of magnanimity of yours? Your professional connection, how will it be affected by this affair? I am a woman, and cannot judge, so I would like to be informed." "t cannot tell you it remains to be seen," said Francis Heath. smiling sadly. "Your sister?" inquired Constance. My sister is a very excellent woman in most circum-: stances. That she is not equal to a crisis of this sort must not be accounted a crime," said Francis Heath, still smiling sadly. "I see that even you are conscious how fatal to all your worldly prospects is your heroic act. But God reigns, and Christ has overcome the world 1" said Constance, with tears of mingled admiration and compassion starting to her eyes. ".Well,' said Francis with a smile and a sigh, "let me but see my poor, innocent Alice safely through her perils, and I shall be content. If society frowns too darkly on us, here, why the world is wide, and India or America offers a new field." ' And heaven will prosper you wherever you go, be sure of that," said Constance, fervently. "But Alice I how is she?" "Poor child I still suffering very much fror a'll that she has gone through. Still very much in need of the kind, encouraging sympathy of some gentle lady friend," replied the doctor, gravely. "I will go to her to-day; I will go to her at once," said Constance, eagerly. "Indeed, I came hither with the purpose of asking you to be so kind." "Where shall I find her? Where is she?" "At my house; the one lately occupied by my predeces-   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        .29 aor, Mr. Thorpe.

Mine enemy, when he chose his part, Chose time, and place, and company To suit it; when he struck at length, Mine honor, 'twas with all his strength.-Browning. WE must now return to Alice, whom we left sitting in the quiet home to which her husband had introduced her. It was while the poor young creature yet remained alone, and bewildered with the strangeness of her position, that the door was opened, and a visitor was ushered in by Mar. tin, who immediately retired, leaving them together. Alice, who had been sitting-upon the side of her sofa, with her head drooped upon her hand, looked up, and, in terror and abhorrence, recognized her mortal enemy. She would have started up and called the retreating servant, but that her limbs and voice failed as she gazed upon the fatal countenance of her persecutor. While her eyes were still magnetized, as it were,: to his face, he drew the easyrchair before her, threw himself into it, and sitting at ease, with his hands resting upon his knees, stooped forward, looked steadily in her face, and said-          "Xej led at thie prison to see you this morning, Alice, but was told that you had been released upon the recogni- zance of Francis Heath* Coming hither to inquire, I find that you are under his protection.

"Remorseless sinner," breathed the girl, in a fainting voice. "1TNo hard names, Alice, if you please, for they may be returned with interest, you know. What if I were to repay you-back in words, such as these," and he whispered, "thief, felon, convict ' Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones,' it is said. But, fair one, I did not come hither to quarrel, but to compromise with you, if possible." Alice, white, cold, and trembling, started up to spring to the door and call assistance, but her tormentor quietly arose and stood in her way, fixing upon her a steady look that seemed to paralyse her limbs, for she sank back into her seat. "Ah!" said the visitor, as he saw this effect. "Alice, I came here to save you, if you will consent to be saved." "To save me, destroyer?" fell from the faltering lips of the victim. "Yes; to save you, if, as I said, you will be saved." Shuddering, she averted her head, and dropped her face Into her hands. "Alice," he continued, reseating himself, advancing his lips close to her ear, and sinking his voice to a whisper, "Alice, it will not be easy, but it will be possible, to free /you from  this charge upon which you are to be tried. Listen to me I  Consent to be mine, and I will- say that to-day I have discovered the jewels were placed in your trunk  through the mistake of a careless servant who assisted you in packing, and so withdraw the prosecution. Say, Alice, will you consent to these terms?" "Serpent-no l" replied the girl, shrinking from his contact. "No? Well, hear me before you make that ' no' final; let sae inform you what ' no' involves before you render it   THE   GIPSY'S PROPHECY.      381 irrevocable. That 'no' involves the continuation of the prosecution; your case will go to trial; the positive evidence, the jewelry found in your possession, will convict you; the value of the jewelry is fifteen hundred pounds; it will send you to prison for ten years of close confinement and hard labor. Do you hear that? Speak, do you hear that?" Alice shivered, but disdained to reply. "Can you, a delicate girl, bear prison discipline-a narrow cell, a straw mattrass, coarse food, hard labor, harsh usage, and the companionship only of felons and jailers, and all this for ten long years?" Still she continued to shudder and to be silent. "And above all, can you bear the irremediable disgrace? Look up, girl. Speak, for I will have a reply." Suddenly Alice dropped her hands from before her pale and agonized face, and answered- "No, I could not for a week endure the life you have exhibited to me, least of all could I bear the degradation." "I know you could not, Alice, and I only held it up before you in terrorum, as the pedagogues say. I only raised the storm to drive you 'into my sheltering arms. Judge how great must be -my passion for you, Alice, to carry me to such lengths for its gratification. Come, be'- mine," he said, attempting to take her hand, but she shrankl shuddering away from him, exclaiming-  'IFool and blind I I said I could not for a week endure the life of indignities. you held up before my mind.

"There is no necessity for that, foolish girl. I offer you a blissful alternative. Why should you prefer a prison to freedom, loathsome living to luxury, harsh driving to tender caresses, infamy to honor, death to life?" "Oh, I am most culpable to hear you so long. Away, sir, for even were you as honorable as you are base, I am a wedded wife, and must not listen to you." "A wedded wife!" exclaimed the baffled suitor, in in- credulous amazement. "Yes, sir; one who has more strength of faith than I have has this, morning thrown his legal protection around me," said Alice, in a firmer voice, gathering strength from the very thought of that royal-hearted friend who had so nobly drawn her, all wretched as she was, to the shelter of his bosom. "A wife I ha, ha, ha I Well, your legal protector cannot shield you from the law, minion I None can save you from that, or from the county jail that must follow, but myself I Remember!"  "Leave me, sir 1 or I shall rise and call assistance!" ex- claimed Alice, who had now partly recovered from the first effects of her terror. "And so the fool has married you, forsooth," he ex- claimed, starting up and striding up and down the room. Then pausing, and confronting her with his huge frame shaking, and his harsh face flashing with passion, he cried- "A wedded wife, said you? A hopeful dower will you bring your husband-a dower of guilt, misery, and dishonor I He shall see you arraigned as a thief, convicted as a felon, sentenced as a convictI And there in the open court   THE   IPSsY'S  PROPPHECY   .   333 will I so blacken your character, that every friend you have shall shrink in honor from your contact; and he, your hus- band, shall curse, the hour when your fatal charms lured him to such deep dishonor." With a half-suppressed shriek, Alice covered her face with her hands, and sank back half-fainting upon the sofa. Just at that moment the door was opened -by Martin, who announced-- "M Mrs. Mostyn." And Constance entered. In an instant Dr. Horne recovered his self-possession, composed his countenance to a mild and mournful expres- sion, modulated his voice to a gentle and sorrowful tone, and said- "Well, young woman, since you utterly refuse to account for the presence of the pearls in your trunk, I see no other way than to permit the law to take its course I Good morning, Mrs. Mostyn," he added, bowing to that lady as he passed out. Constance returned the salutation with a cold nod, and passed into the room. "Well, my poor Alice, what is the matter?" "Oh, the snake I the snake i" cried the girl, in loathing. "What snake, good Alice?" :,' The snake that has just glided from the room." "Dr. Horne?" "Yes, madam.

ALICE had never found courage to inform her lover of he original cause of Dr. Horne's persecution of herself   THES  GIPSY S iROPHECY.        385 but now that her lover had become her husband, she felt that he was entitled to her unreserved confidence. But how should she be able to tell him this tale? It is true that, at the magistrate's office, under the high pressure of terror, and to explain her position, she had told of the unprincipled conduct of the man; and to Con- stance Mostyn, because the latter was a woman, she had been able to relate the terrible story. But how, for very modesty,should she ever manage to make the degrading disclosure to Francis Heath? And how, for very terror, could she bear to witness his inevita- ble indignation, and see him go off to seek some fatal en. counter with her persecutor? Alice was weak, timid, shrinking; she had nothing whatever of the trenchant bravery of Constance Mostyn's spirit. Therefore, she relied on Constance, and resolved to consult her, and to be guided, by her counsel. One afternoon Mrs. Mostyn came in to see her, and Alice explained her embarrassment. "It is not only from very shame that I' shrink from telling him, but also from fear for him. How must I blush to answer the questions he will certainly ask me; and how tremble to know that he will surely demand satisfaction of my enemy? Oh I if I do not tell him, my reserve will be a sort of ' misprison of treason ' and if I do, my communica- tion will assuredly hurry him into more trouble!  Advise me-what shall I do?" she asked, in conclusion of her ex- planation. "Tell Francis all-every jot and tittle; though your cheeks should blush W ith womanly shame in repeating the insults to which you have been subjected, and though they may grow pale with fear of the consequences the recital may entail, yet tell him the whole," replied Constance, firmly. "It is for you to feel the fullest faith in him who has so richly merited your trust, and it is for him to act  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7861-00000159"/> do    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. according to his own judgment in the premises. Besides, my poor girl, you should understand that the knowledge of your great wrongs is absolutely necessary to your advocate in preparing your defence." 'Ah, yes, if I could gain credence. You, dear lady, believe me; so-dQes Mr. Mostyn, and so does Francis; but will any one else credit the unsupported statement of an obscure and friendless girl against the well-established repu- tation of Dr. Horne and the circumstantial evidence he can produce? Would not, to tell this story, be to risk my dear husband's safety without the smallest chance of secur- ing my own? For, oh, lady, there is no chance for me- none, none. I shall, perish-irremediably perish; but I would not draw him down into destruction with me. Too greatly have I already wronged him in consenting to be his wife. I must do him no further harm; for oh, if it were to save my body from the burning, I would not have him scathe one hair of his head. Do you not know this?" she asked, wringing her hands. "Yes, I know it. Nevertheless, poor Alice, it- is right that you should make this disclosure; and you should do right irrespective of consequences, leaving them to God- that is, faith," said Constance, decidedly. "Mrs. Mostyn's decision of character governed poor Alice; and that night, when Francis Heath came home from his round of patients, and entered her chamber, and their conve'rsation turned upon the subject of her approach- ing trial, she told him all. He heard her through, almost without a comment, but with corrugated brows, gleaming eyes, and compressed lips --all more terrible in their stillness of suppressed excite- ment than the greatest outhreak of fury could have been. And at the close of his recital he stooped and kissed her forehead and her hand; then arose, took down his hat, and turxed to leave the room.   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHEYo    .     33' Alice sprang after him and seized his hand, exclaiming- "Francis, oh, dear Francis, where are you going ? "No where, dear wife, but whither you may safely pray God speed me." "Ah, but what are you about to do, Francis?' "Nothing, mymuch-injured love, but what I ma  y well ask God's blessing upon," he answered, pausing loug enough to draw her upon his bosom in a parting 'embrace . Then releasing her, he ran down stairs, and out of the  street door.                     - And Alice re-entered her lonely chamber to walk the, floor, weep, and wait his return. Francis H1eath threw himself upon horseback, and galloped rapidly across the plains, through the forest, and over the mountain ridge that lay between the village and Radnor's Ruin, at which he arrived by nine o'clock. Drawing rein at the front porch, he sprang from his saddle, ran up the steps, and rang a peal that soon brought a servant in haste to open the-door. "Is your master in?" "No, sir; he has just gone out." "Whither?" "To see ai patient, sir." "What patient?" "I do not know, sir; one who has sent for him in haste.", "Very well, I will wait for him," said the visitor, with grim resolution, striding into the hall, and throwing him- self into a seat.  The servant looked perplexed; but being overawed by something in the aspect of the speaker, he bowed, retired, and ieft: him to himself. And for hours Francis Heath sat there, with stern deter- mination, awaiting the arrival of Dr. Horne. It was some time after midnight that, reluctantly giving  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7861-00000160"/> 338    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. up the hope of seeing the master of the house that night, the visitor, unwilling to torture his own wife by a longer absence from his home, arose and left the hall, remounted his horse, and rode rapidly towards the village. It was near morning when he reached his house, when he found Alice up, and anxiously watching for him. By her eager inquiries, she gained from him the fact that no rencounter had as yet taken place between himself and Dr. Horne; and for this postponement of the dreaded event the poor girl breathed a fervent- "Thank God P" The next day Francis Heath again rode over to Radnor, but with no better success. The delinquent was not to be seen. And for many days thereafter he diligently sought the dastard, who quite as diligently kept out of the way. At last, one Thursday afternoon, when he had surely tracked his enemy home to Radnor's Ruin, he rode up to, the door, threw himself from his horse, ran up the steps, and knocked with so imperious a hand that he quickly brought a servant in answer to his summons. "Your master is at home now, for I saw him enter the house I Take my card to him immediately, and tell him that I am waiting impatiently to see him 1" said the visitor, in a peremptory tone, thrusting the pasteboard into the hand of the man. "Yes, sir, but---.  said the servant, hesitating. "But what, you stupid fellow? What subterfuge now?" exclaimed the young gentleman, chafing with anger and impatience. "Why, perhaps you are not aware, sir, that my mistress is dying, and my master was summoned in haste to come to her." "Dying I your mistress, Dr. Horne's wife, dying 1" ":As I just had the honor to inform you, sir."   THE  GIPSY's   PROPHECY.      833. "I believe you are deceiving me," thought Francia Heath, fixing a penetrating gaze upon the servant. "Since when has Mrs. Horne been worse?" "Ever since she heard how Miss Alice Owen was taken up, for steal---" "Silence, villain!" thundered the young man, in a tone that made the servant turn death-like with terror. Then blaming himself for having spoken so furiously to a poor wretch, who only parrot-like repeated what he had heard, he inquired, with a calmer manner- "How long has Mrs. Horne been supposed to be dying?" "Ever since she heard what I told youf honor," replied the man, cautiously. His report was soon confirmed by the old nurse, who chanced to pass through the hall in going down stairs upon an errand. And thus it was evident, even to the natural incredulity of the frequently-deceived and baffled inquirer, that the mistress of the mansion was really in the last ex- tremity, and thus also it followed that, as he could not properly call. a man from the bedside of a dying wife, justice must remain for the present in abeyance. At sunset that evening Mrs. HBorne expired. And poor Alice, hearing of the event, found tears to spare from her own personal sorrows to give to the memory of her earliest friend. On Sunday the funeral of Mrs. Horne was solemnized with great pomp. And on Monday the spring term of the criminal court opened, and the triaFof Alice Owen, the first upon the list, was expected to come op. Always the opening of the court term collects a crowd of people at the court house, and this occasion was far from being an exception to the rule. The town was full. True, the trial of a poor girl for larceny is unhappily no such rare case as to make a public sensation; but then                     .  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7861-00000161"/> 340    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHEC    dT. there were circuimstances connected with that of Alice Owen which constituted it one of peculiar interest. She was beautiful, graceful, and accomplished; and though the child of humble parents, she had been accus- tomed to mingle on something approaching to equal terms with the respectable society of the county. She had been the principal witness in the late great murder trial, upon which occasion her loveliness of face, form, antdimanner, no less than her painful reluctance to testify against the prisoner, had attracted general attention. Notw, her arrest upon the degrading charge ot theft; her incredible statements so tremendously implicating the char- acter of her prosecutor; the incomprehensible circumstance that the Mostyns, upon whom her testimony in the murder case had borne so fatally, were now her partisans; and, above all, her strange marriage with Francis Heath, on the morning after her arrest, all combined to excite a very great and general feeling of curiosity. The case, confounding as it was, "lay in a nutshell." Alice Owen had hitherto been a girl not only of un- blemished character, but of high reputation for piety. Francis Heath, who had given her the testimonial of his owhn nade and hand, was a gentleman of known honor. But then Dr. Horne, the prosecutor, was also a man of unquestioned truth.. From  the data in their possession, the little world of Gwyn made up various opinions. The great majority, hav- ing entire faith in the unquestionable reputation of Dr. Horne, utterly discredited the story of Alice Owen, whom they looked upon as one of those wicked, artful, and dan- gerous females whom it would be desirable to see impris- oned, hanged, or in any other way suppressed; and viewed Francis Heath as the victim of her -beauty, art, and machi- rs, again, putting equal truns .

No one, perhaps, except the Mostyns and Francis Heath, doubted the-honesty of Dr. Home, or thoroughly believed in the innocence of Alice All parties looked forward to the approaching trial with the deepest interest and curiosity. But poor Alice I The morning of that fatal day found her pale, trembling, and shrinking from the impending crisis, even as the most guilty might shrink from conviction. At an early hour a sheriff's officer appeared at the house. Her failing limbs could scarcely support her while standing before the little mirror arranging her morning dress; her quivering fingers could scarcely clasp the hooks of her black bodice'; at length, indeed, she sank helplessly into a chair; and then her husband, with affectionate care, com- pleted her toilet--tying on her small black velvet bonnet, wrapping her in the little black mantle, and drawing on her tiny gloves. "Now, my own dear love, trust in Heaven and be firm, will you not?" asked Francis, as he stooped and kissed her. "As the Lord shall-give me grace," she replied, clasping her hands. The carriage was waiting at the door to convey her to the court house.   Poor old Mrs. Martin came up, bringing a cup of strong coffee, which she kindly forced upon her young guest. Alice, to please her, drank a little. Francis Heath then conducted his poor wife down stairs, placed her in the carriage, where an officer was in atteldl 21  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7861-00000162"/> SA2    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. t'ee, gnd directed the coachman to drive to the court house.

The trial began. The public prosecutor opened the case, stating the theory of the theft in a few cold words, for, truth -to tell, he did not relish his present duty, and his eye turned more in compassion than in denunciation upon the young crea- ture whom,at worst, he regarded only as a very bad child, a fitter subject for a parent's chastening rod than for a crim- inal court's judgment. Having stated his case, he pro- ceeded to call his witnesses. ' Let Dr. Horne take the stand." Every spectator turned towards that part of the court- room whence this gentleman was seen to arise and advance towards the box; and as, he -took his place to give in his testimony, every eye was riveted upon him in surprise, per- plexity, and conjecture. Could this be the handsome, graceful, and fascinating Dr. Horne? His tall and athletic figure was bowed and tremulous; his fine face pallid and haggard; his eyes wild, as with pain, grief, or fear. Being duly sworn, he commenced, and in a distracted and wandering manner, gave the same testimony that he had offered at the preliminary examination-to the effect that, he had often detected the prisoner at the bar in petty -theft; that he had perseveringly endeavored to reform her; that, pitying her orphan condition, he had retained her in his family as long as he possibly could do so; that, finding her perfectly incorrigible, he hitL at lengths felt obliged to dismiss her; that soon after her withdrawal from his house he had discovered the loss of the jewels that were /ihelame night found in' her possession.  -     ^:;- * Dr. Home, as I said, gave in his testimony  - ing, faltering, and disjointed manner, that excitedSi+)b'ur-s  &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7861-00000163"/> 344    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.' prise, curiosity, and speculation of all'who saw and heard him. "How unwilling he is to testify against the girl," said some. "How badly he feels; it is easy to see that he is a kind-hearted man," said others. Francis Heath, who stood just beneath the dock where the prisoner was enclosed, raised himself, and whispered to her- "Look at that man, Alice. If ever I saw perjurer written legibly upon a human being's brow, it is impressed upon his." Alice stole a glance at her persecutor, shuddered, and withdrew her eyes. The poor girl was amazed and, fright- ened at every thing she saw and heard-the crowded court- room, the judge on the bench, the jury in their box, the array of lawyers,' the formality of the proceedings, all awed and oppressed her to faintness-but this evil spirit, this haggard perjurer in the witness-box, made her sick unto death with terror, loathing, and abhorrence. Dr. Horne having finished his testimony, would have willingly withdrawn, but the counsel for the prisoner arose, 9   and took him in hand for a cross-examination.  But, though the witness was evidently ill, unnerved, and con- fused, yet he was very careful not to contradict himself, and-so, successfully, he passed the severe ordeal. Then pleadinj sickness, exhaustion, and sorrow from recent domebtic affliction in the loss of his wife, he begged permis- sion to withdraw, and was allowed to retire. The two policemen who arrested Alice Owen were next, in turn, examined. Each -being duly sworn, testified to the finding of the casket of pearls in the possession of the prisoner The jewelry was then produced in court, and identified- irst by the policemen, as the same- found in the trunk of   THRE  GIPSY'S   PROPHECY.      384 Alice Owen, and afterwards by Dr. Horne, who was re- called, as the property of his late wife. The Crown's counsel then briefly and coldly summed up the evidence, and the prosecution rested. Mr. Wright, the counsel for the prisoner, arose for the defence. He gave, with more feeling and eloquence than sound logic, perhaps, his client's exposition of her case. He spoke of the prisoner's youth, beauty, and grace; of her helpless orphanage land dependent position in the house- hold of Dr. Horne; of her employer's unprincipled pursuit of this fatherless, motherless, and friendless girl; of his alarming threats and machinations against her; of the par., tial success, at least, with which those threats and machi- nations had been followed up. But did any one believe, he asked, that they could be successfully carried out? Could any one look upon the sweet, young face of his client, and doubt her spotless innocence? Or could they gaze upon the countenance of her persecutor as he stood in the witness-box, and give an instant's credence to his state- ments? The front of the one was the front of a demon- that of the other, the face ofan angel-yes, of an angel in woman's form, such as, from  the whole history of her blameless and beneficent life, he would prove her to be, by a host of witnesses, whom he should call for the purpose; but first of all, he said, he would indicate one, his friend, Francis Heath, whom they all knew to be a gentleman of the highest worth, but who could not legally testify in be- half of the prisoner,because, since her arrest, he had given her the strongest testimonyit was possible to give of his confidence and esteem --he had givenS her his hand in mar-, riage. The sole fact advanced against his client was the finding of the missing jewelry in her trunk. Was that one deceptive fact to be taken against the testimony of her whole good life, and that of the esteem of all who knew her well? How easily might that casket have been ,con-  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7861-00000164"/> "    ToHE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. veyed into her trunk for her destruction t How much  more rational to suppose that it was thus treacherously put into her unconscious possession, than that she who had lived from infancy a pure and pious life, should in one hour become a thief and a felon I The gentlemen of the jury must not, upon such slight grounds, consign a young, lovely,. and innocent woman to the ignominy of a prison. Unless the Crown'si counsel could produce some-stronger evidence, he should demand for his client a prompt ac- quittal. He then called, in succession, several highly respectable witnesses, who each, in turn, bore testimony to the-excel- lent character hitherto sustained by Alice Owen. And having thus made the best possible defence out of the poorest material, the counsel for the prisoner sat down, The counsel for the Crown waived his privilege, or else dodged the duty, of having the last word in the argument. The judge arose to sum up the evidence and charge the jury.  He reviewed the case in a clear, cold, candid man, aer, dwelling upon- the testimony of Dr. orne, and the finding of the stolen property in the possession of the pris. oner; as evidence of the most positive character known in Ia,; but exhorting them, if any doubt rested upon their IddS as to the- guilt of the prisoner, to let her have the /- ) nefit of that doubt. The jEdge sat down, and the jury retired under charge of "the, he"ad constable to deliberate upon their verdict.   e .. . . e   C HA PT E R XXI X VII.

WHEN the door had closed noiselessly after the retiring jury the stillness of suspended. animation fell upon the court room. Like a statue sat the venerable judge upon his bench. Like automata the lawyers bent their heads together and conversed, if they conversed at all, in almost inaudible whispers.-               a Pale and almost dying in the agony of this suspense, Alice leaned back in her seat. Once she spoke in a hoarse whisper. Francis Heath  bent eagerly forward to hear what she wished to say. "Oh, will it be long?" she)'asked, in an expiring voice. "No, dearest, we hope not; we trust that they will soo- return with your acquittal; for even they must hawe a -doubt; and the judge has instructed them to give you the benefit of that doubt;' take courage, dearest Alice." Time crept slowly-slowly-past.    An hour went by, another followed, and yet the' jury came not. "Oh I will it be much longer?" again groaned Alice. "No, no, dear love, it'cannot be, you know," replied her husband. Another hour crept slowly by, and still another. One by one the spectators withdrew from the court to procure refreshment, and the lawyers looked restless and the judge sleepy.

"' No, no, sweet wife, be patient; this very delay is a most auspicious omen. They could not acquit you without this debate," said Francis, who then beckoned a constable to his side, and despatched him to the nearest pastry-cook's for refreshments. The messenger returned with wine and biscuits, which Francis Heath tried to press upon the acceptance of his wife. But she put them away, saying- "Dear Francis, I cannot. If I could I would do it for your sake; but my throat is constricted, I can scarcely speak, I cannot possibly swallow." And her head dropped upon the railing before her. And still slowly, slowly moved the leaden hours. The clock struck seven. The judge arose from his seat and the court was adjourned till ten o'clock the next morning. Lifting Alice in his arms, Francis Heath bore, her to the carriage, took her home, and laid her, in an almost expiring condition, upon the bed. Then he summoned the kind- hearted Martin, and, with her assistancehe applied all his medical skill to the restoration of the nelatily dying girl. It was a long time before she spoke, and then it was in a manner that went to the hearts of those who heard her- "Oh I Francis, Francis, this is very terrible; the black- ness of idarkness. Oh, Francis, dear, let me die; it is the most merciful thing you can do for me!" "Dear Alice, try to take courage; be firm and patient, love. This delay is really auspicious, and it cannot last much longer. Shall I send for Mrs. Mostyn to come to you?"  "No, no, I wish to see no one-not even her; I only vWant you, dear, devoted friend, to be with me while yet you may," she said. What a miserable night was that which followed I    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        349 !Alice never slept for an instant, but lay with her eyes closed and her hands clasped above her head, silently praying for death as for a priceless blessing. Francis Heath sat beside her bed, watching her with devoted affection. Yes, it was a miserable night I but even more miserable was the next fatal day. At ten o'clock, Alice, in the same half-dying state, was lifted from her bed, and by the united assistance of Francis Heath and Mrs. Martin, she was dressed and conducted to the carriage which was to convey her to the court- house. On arriving thither she was lifted out and supported into the court-room to the same seat she had occupied on the previous day. Her husband sat down beside her as near as he could get. The court-room was even' more crowded than on the pre- ceding day; but a strange stillness prevailed throughout the assembly. As before, hour after hour of breathless suspense passed. The sheriff sometimes passed backwards and forwards between the court-room and. the jury-room, but nothing could be learned from his impassible countenance. A rumor was, however, beginning to be circulated to the effect that the jury was " hung." "Oh I Lord of mercy I can it be much longer?" groaned Alice, from the depth of her anguish., "Pray to God; be patient; be firm, sweet Alice," whispered her husband. Another dreary hour passed, and then a buzz went through the court of 'They are coming!" and the door was thrown open and the jury came in. Francis Heath saw spasm after spasm convulse the form of his wife, as her head rested on the rails. He looked up. quickly to see if he could read her fate in the faces of those who held it in their hands. And his own heart seemed to  &#xD;<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7861-00000166"/> s,85   TH'E - GIPSSY7S PR OPHEECY. die in his bosom as he saw them advance, two by two, with grave faces bent upon their breasts. The pre-vision of his heart was true. The verdict was-- Guilty P!' As this dreadful word passed from the foreman's lips Francis E Heath saw the spasms that shook his wife's form suddenly cease. "Let the prisoner stand up to receive the sentence of the law," ordered the clerk. "She has fainted, I fear, your lordship," replied the broken-hearted Francis. But to his surprise he -saw Alice move and tremble, slightly,;and the next instant she arose, and, pale indeed as death, stood up. And amid the profound silence that ensued the judge, pronounced her doom. For her alleged offence the law prescribed imprisonment for a term of not less than five or more than ten years. Tile judge, in well-meant mercy, gave her the minimum. She was sentenced to five years of confinement at hard labor in the county prison-the sentence to take effect upon the following Friday. At the conclusion of his words Alice sank back in her seat. "Oh, Alice I Oh, my wife," burst in anguish from the lips of her husband as he bent over her.  ; "No,ing wife of yours now; only a convict; dear Francis, see-.-I can bear this certainty of the worst better than that suspense which stretched my whole soul upon the rack.

"I am very sorry, Dr. Heath, but I am forced, you know, to take away my prisoner," whispered the constable at his elbow. "Oh, Alice, Alice, must you be torn from me " he cried, losing all self-command. "Francis, dear Francis, do you take courage now. Be the Christian hero that you were. Bless me and let me go," said Alice. After all the mortal anguish of her suspense how awfully calm she was, now that all hope had fled and the very worst, was known I "Dr. Heath," said the pitying constable, "you can! goh with her to the prison, you know; give heryour arm ando support h her to the carriage, for, notwithstanding her, admirable fortitude, you see she is physically very feeble." Francis Heath, with an ejaculatory prayer, arose and, did as he was permitted. And leaning on his arm and  closely followed by the officer, Alice was conducted from the court and placed in the carriage. A drive of five min-" utes brought her to the  prison, where she was met by the compassionate jailer, who conducted her back to-her former cell, where the constable left her.         .; Francis Heath was permitted to remain with her for a short time. , And Mrs. Mostyn, who had with great grief heard of the verdict, as soon as she" could sufficiently compose her, excited feelings, came to visit her.

"I know it," answered Alice, calmly, " and I, too, hope." But while she spoke how short her breathing was I With newly-aroused fear her husband noticed this, and saying- "You are very much exhausted, Alice; let me lay you down," he gently took her in his arms and placed her in an easy position on the cot. Still her breathing grew shorter, her face paler, her lips bluer, her eyes dimmer. "I have some spirits of lavender-a fine restorative-in my medicine-chest; let mo go and fetch it," said Mrs. Mostyn, leaving the cell for the expressed purpose, while Dr. Heath sat beside the sufferer, anxiously watching her countenance, holding her hand, and smoothing her fore- head. When the lady returned with the restorative, he would have put it to her lips, but she waved it off, and sadly shook her head; and when he would have pressed the cordial on her acceptance, she sorrowfully smiled, saying- "Dear friends, it would be a cruel kindness to place a cordial to the lips of one who is dying on the rack; it would be a merciful neglect to suffer such a one to die." ",But, dear Alice," said Mrs. Mostyn, "you must live I live and recover, and hope I Your sentence may never be carried into effect." "I know it will not, madam," answered Alice, with a strange smile.           -  "I speak it from a certain conviction, Alice," said Con- stance. "And I also, lady," added Alice, with the same sweet, solemn manner. "I mean, dear Alice, that my husband, who is a lawyer, you know, is now engaged in drawing up a petition to the Minister in your name and behalf. Before twelve o'clock that petition will be signed by a hundred persons; before to-morrow night it will be in the. hands of the Minister,   THE  GIPSY'S- PROPHECY.       353 Lord Starr saw and. knew you at Llyndell; he can't but remember and compassionate you; and I have no doubt that, before Thursday evening, the pardon will be in the hands of the sheriff." "Ah, madam, to be pardoned for a crime I could never have committed-could such a thing as that save me?" in- quired Alice, with bitter and sorrowful emphasis. Mrs. Mostyn had nothing to reply-to that searching question; but after a little while, she said- "Alice, how you will be saved I do not know, but that you will be I feel sure. The justice of Heaven is your security." As she spoke there came a knock at the door; it was from Mr. Wardour, who had all this time been keeping guard outside, and who now put in his head to warn them that the hour for locking up having arrived, Dr. Heath must take leave of his wife; secondly, that Mr. Mostyn had ready the petition for the doctor to carry around. "And so, dear Alice, I must bid you good night, as I must obtain every possible signature before I leave for London, where I understand, the Minister has now re- turned," said Francis Heath, and stooping, he pressed a kiss upon the brow of the stricken girl. "You will care for her and comfort her, Mrs. Mostyn?" he asked, turning to the lady. "As if she were my sister," replied Constance Another prayerful kiss upon the pallid brow of the sufferer, a deferential Jbow to Constance, and Francis Heath reluctantly withdrew from the cell, Mrs. Mostyn remained near the poor convicted girl a little while longer, when she left her, apparently sleeping the sleep of exhaustion: It was not really so. Poor Alice had feigned this sleep; that the lady might have comfort.  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7861-00000168"/> CHAPTER XXXXVIII Burning heart and beating brow, Ye are very quiet now.--. B. Browutng. As Constance -had said, before twelve o'clock that night a hundred signatures were obtained to the petition for the pardon of Alice. At midnight Francis Heath threw him- self into the stage-coach that at that hour passed through Gwyn on its way to meet the London train, and commenced his anxious journey. In still greater anxiety passed the hours to those left behind. Constance could not sleep. Early she arose and went to the prison-gate, when, being admitted by Tom Turner, she went to the cell of Alice, and peeping through the grating, she saw the poor girl lying wide awake, with her *wild eyes fared back and fixed upon the ceiling. - "Alice, did you sleep well?" she inquired. "If I dIid not, I shall soon, dear lady," replied the prisoner. "Mr. Turner, please unlock the door, and let me in to her," said the. lady. The' turnkey flew to do her bidding, and she passed in to the sufferer, sat down beside her, spoke soothingly to her, bathed her face and hands, and finally despatched Tomr Turner for a cup of strong coffee, which, when brought, -she coaxed her to drink. In a word, Mrs. Mostyn re- 'mained as long as she possibly could do without neglecting her husband, and did all that was possible to be done to alleviate the condition of the unfortunate girl. "She divided her time and attention almost equally between the two prisoners. (354)   THE  GIPSY-S PROPHEC    Y. C355 But through all that miserable day Alice remained ex- tended upon her prison cot, her wild, black hair streaming down :each side her pallid face, her thin, transparent hands pressed upon her eyes, as if to shut out light and life, her form motionless or trembling; patiently she bore her anguish; obediently she did all that she was told to do; thankfully she took every restorative that was offered her; and yet through all it, was easy to see that she did these things rather for the sake of those who attended her than from any hope of benefit. e"A sufferer so hopeless, so gentle, and so resigned, I never saw. before," said Constance to Gerald. "If her sentence is carried into effect she cannot live a week, nor, indeed, in that case, would it be desirable that she should," he replied. Through all the miserable night that followed Alice lay sleepless, but uncomplaining. Near midnight, as before, she feigned sleep, that Constance, who was watching her, might go to rest. The next morning, Thursday, Mrs. Mostyn, as on the day preceding, went early to her cell, where she found her lying upon her back, with her hands clasped above her head, and her open eyes fixed vacantly upon the ceiling in un- winking wakefulness. This was the day upon which Dr. Heath was expected to return. Dr. Heath, with the pardon, would, in all probability, reach Gwyn about sunset. If so, then Alice would, before Mea-time, leave the prison for her home. Constance reminded ]her of this probability, and sought to infuse hope into her despairing heart, to revive her drooping spirit, and nerve her failing strength. But then again, should the pardon not be granted, this was the last, last day she could be permitted to remain, even in this county-prison cell, in reach of herfriends;for  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7861-00000169"/> 356    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. the next day, Friday, it was appointed that her sentence should be carried into effect-that she should be conveyed to the prison' of Ghoran, And through this day, as through the preceding one, poor Alice lay almost lifeless, with her wild, black hair streaming down each side her pallid face, and straggling over the coverlid; her pale hands pressed upon her eyes to shut out the daylight, and. her fragile form motionless or convulsed, or, towards even- ing, starting up in eager listening as for some approaching footstep. "What excites you so, poor child?" inquired Constance, on seeing her -spring up in this manner for the third or fourth time. "I was listening for him I Oh, how I fear that he will not come to-night-that he will wait for the pardon-the pardon that will not be given him to-day, nor to-morrow, nor any other day; but I fear that he will wait for it, and so not come until it is too late P"  "It is your nervousness; never fear, dear Alice, but that he will surely come. The coach is late, I know, but then - the roads, this thawing weather, are very bad; the coach will be in the town, and he will be in your presence very soon now," said the lady, cheerfully. Alice for a little while lay still, with her hands pressed upon her eyes, and then, snatching them away, she started up and listened eagerly, as usual. "It is nothing but a carriage rolling down the street, my dear." She sank back silent and fainting, and then, removing her hands from her eyes, she looked around wildly, mur- muring-- "Am I going blind, or is it growing dark, Mrs. Mostyn fl" "Growing dark?"Why, the setting sun was streaming Through the grating, marking the panes in golden squares upon the floor of the cell. Mrs. Mostyn lookedat the poor   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        857 girl in astonishment, and saw with alarm that her face was' darkened with a gray shadow, and her eyes glazed over with a dimness as of approaching death. Constance flew out, and brought a glass of wine, which she forced Alice to drink. "I am dying, am I not, lady?" inquired the prisoner, faintly. "No, no; you are exhausted, that is all. Momentary failure of the eyesight is very often the effect of nervous prostration," replied Constance, eagerly. "AHark I he has come! That is he at last-I know his step!" exclaimed Alice, starting up for the last time, and listening with suspended breath. It was indeed his step. Constance also recognized it as it came near the cell. "He has not got the pardon, lady; I know it by the slowness and heaviness of his footfall; but I knew it also -before," said Alice. The door opened, and Dr. Heath entered, pale, worn, and heart-broken, and stood gazing for a moment in de- spairing silence upon Alice, then he approached and sank upon his knees beside her cot, and extended his hands, as if to catch her to the shelter of his bosom. He could not tell her in words that he had failed of sav- ing her. She half arose and cast her arms around his neck, and dropped her head upon his breast. "Do not mind it, dear Francis; I am not disappointed; I knew it would be so; .dear Francis, do not grieve- so bitterly-all will be well," she said, tenderly caressing him as he bowed his head and wept-wept as only a strong, brave man, can weep.  !

"Oh, that I could die to deliver you, gentle and inno. cent one I Oh, that I could suffer hI your stead 1" he ex- claimed, with a strong burst of sorrow. "You suffer more than I do; see, I do not suffer much; believe me, all will very soon be well." While the heart-broken young couple thus conversed, Constance sat, pale with pity, silently praying for them, but offering no word of comment. At last, when Francis, kneeling beside the cot, had com- pelled himself into a state of composure, and Alice, reclin- ing back upon her pillow, still kept her hand resting upon his shoulder as in benediction, and her eyes fixed upon his face in deep affection, the sweet and solemn tones of Con. stance gently rose upon the silence. "All is not lost in the first disappointment," she said; "'the Minister may yet relent, he could not, perhaps, grant an immediate pardon; he would probably think some delay due in respect to the court. Dear Alice, try to bear up, love; dear Francis, take courfage; you are .both good; trust in God for deliverance," and stooping, she pressed a kiss upon the brow -of Alice, and clasped the hand of Francis. The one returned her kindness with an earnest grasp, the other with a grateful glance, but neither spoke. Constance arose to retire and leave them alone. But at that moment there came a  rap at the cell door, and the next instant Mr. Wardour presented himself, say. ing, with visible regret- "I am very sorry, Dr. Heath, but the hour has arrived for shutting up, and -.-" "Very well, I must withdraw, I suppose,: said the young man, repressing the groan that arose to his lips "I grieve to say, yes, sir: but here is the sheriff outside who would like to say a few words to you."   THE  GI-PSY'S PROPHECY.       358 "I am at his orders. Alice, my love," he said,.ge'ntly disengaging her hand from around his shoulder, and bend-- ing- over her, "I must commit you to Heaven and its an- gels, and bid you good-night for the present. At the earliest hour of opening to-morrow I shall be with you again. Good night, dear love," and unmindful of the glances that might rest upon them, he bent and pressed a kiss upon her lips. She took both his hands in hers, and holding them, gazed long and earnestly into his eyes; then, with a whispered "God bless you, Francis," she let them go. He hurried from the cell, In the lobby the sheriff joined him, and they walked down together to the governor's office, where Mr. Harrison handed a chair to his companion, and, taking another, entered into conversation by saying- "You should be told, doctor, that I must send my pris- oner to Ghoran early to-morrow." ('I know-I know, escaped in sudden gasps from the frozen lips of the young man, as he dropped his pallid and perspiring brow upon the palms of his hands. Therewas silence for a little while, brokgen at last by Francis, who inquired-- "At what hour, and by what-- conveyance do you send her?"  "At eight o'clock in the morning, in the usual prison van; I am very sorry it dannot be avoided." "No, no," said the young man, mechanically. "But, doctor, I did not bring you here to lacerate your feelings vainly; I wished to make a proposition to you." "Go on," said FranciE  in apathetic despair. "I wished to tell you," said the sheriff, " that there is no absolute necessity for your being separated from her until the latest moment; in a word, there is no necessity for your bidding her a final farewell until the doors of theg prison are about to close upon her." / .

"Do not take it so hard, sir; no doubt it will all come right in the end; she will soon be set at liberty, and you can take her off to Canada or India, where this affair has never been heard of f The young man shook his head in heart-broken hopeless- ness. "But to the point," continued the sheriff. "I can trust you, sir, I know, and so I am' willing to incur the respon- sibility of serving you. I shall, as I said, take her away in a prison van. 'There are four seats. A bailiff and the prisoner will occupy two, a constable will fill a third, the fourth one is heartily at your service, if you wish to- accom- pany her on this sad journey, and will give me your word of honor that no attempt to interrupt the due course of law will be made." "I thank you, sir, and will give you the required pledge," said Francis Heath, in a hoarse and hollow voice. And the interview ended. Francis Heath went back to his desolate home, not t6- sleep, but to pass the night in prayer for her. Alice in her cell, meanwhile, lay as he had left her-lay as she had lain every day and night since her conviction- with her pale hands pressed upon her eyeballs, and her wildly disheveled black hair streaming over the coverlid. The fictitious strength lent her by the glass of wine was fast ebbing away. Constance, watching beside her, saw her increasing pal- lor and faintness, and then bending over her, whispered- "Alice, dear; had you not better take something to sus- tain your strength?" "No, dear lady," replied the feeble voice ; "I only wish to sleep; bid me good-night, and leave me to repose."   THE  GIPSY'S   PROPHE  Y.    81.,  I will sit with you until you slumber, then I will go," replied Constance. "Stoop over me and kiss me, then, for I am going to sleep,' murmured the failing voice. Constance bent and kissed her again and again. "There, that will do, sweet lady. God bless you, God love you, God comfort you in all your sorrows, as you have sought to comfort me. Good-night," said the poor girl, and pressing the hands of Constance to-her heart and to her lips, she resigned them, and laid her own hands up over her eyes as before. Still Constance sat and watched, and soon, by her regular breathing, she believed the sufferer to be at last asleep. She stooped over her and gazed upon her, to assure herself of the fact, and then, feeling reasonably certain that, for the present, the sorrows of that poor young heart were soothed in slumber, she softly sank down upon her knees beside the bed, a,nd earnestly prayed for the deliverance of the innocent captive, Then Constance arose, and giving another look to Alice, and feeling further convinced of the depth of her repose, she gently tapped upon the6door, and beckoned Tom Turner, on guard in the lobby, to come and let her out. The good-natured turnkey hastened to set the lady at liberty, and when she had left the cell, he relocked the door, for, since her conviction, poor Alice had been a close prisoner. Constance retired to her lodgings in the warden's house; but, despite the utter:'weariness of her many nights' watch- ing, she could not sleep. The thought of that poor, inno- cent, persecuted girl, and her hideous fate, kept her awake until very near the morning, when, from sheer prostration, she fell into a disturbed slumber.          . It was yet early when she awoke; her first returning thought was of Alice. She started up, dressed, and hurried  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7861-00000172"/> 862    THE. GIPSY'S    PROPHECY. to the jail. She was soon admitted to the upper lobby. She looked through the grating of Alice's cell, and, as she gazed, a piercing cry broke from her lips-for there lay the hapless girl, prostrate upon her back, her head upwards across the pillow, her face dark and pallid; her lips blue and rigid; her eyes wide open and stony in their sockets; her hands, that had slipped away from her face, tightly contracted, as if she had died -in struggles. One moment after $the cry of horror had escaped her lips, Constance stood and gazed, and then rushing from the cell door, she called- "  Mr. Turner, Mr. Turner, for the love of Heaven, come here I She is dead-dead in her prison cell!" Quick as lightning, Tom Turner came running from the other extremity of the lobby, and in an instant un- locked the door. Constance burst in, and lifted the head of the lifeless girl, while the turnkey followed and stood beside her, wringing his hands, and crying- "Oh, poor thing I poor thing P" "Mr. Turner, run; run and bring a doctor. Life may not yet be extinct." The good-natured officer hastened away to do his errand; but, ere' he reached the head of the stairs, he saw Dr. Heath, who had just gained admittance, coming up. Wanting the moral courage to tell him what had happened, the turnkey only beckoned him to come faster, and led the way to the cell. Without suspicion of the event, Francis Heath hastened up-the lobby and entered the cell, where he found Alice lying as we have described her, and Con- stance standing betide the bed, desperately trying to rub warmth into the lifeless hands. He saw the truth at the first glance, looked for an instant as if turned to stone by the sight; then rushing to the bedside, he caught the body up in his arms, gazed into   THE  GIPSY'S PROPANYO0.        88 the face, laid it down again, rubbed and chafed the hands; groaned, invoked her by every fond epithet to revive, to return to life; called upon God and angels to give her back to his love; then finally he rushed from the cell, and after an absence of a very few minutes, returned with powerful stimulants, some of which he poured into the lifeless lips, and with some of which he chafed the frozen temples and rigid hands. Useless his efforts I He seemed to know they were so even while he continued them. Suddenly he laid them all aside, took a spring lancet from a little pocket-case, stripped up the sleeve of her left arm, and opened a vein; but not one drop of the coagu- lated vital fluid flowed out to give him hope of returning life. Useless all I He felt it now, and closed his lancet, drew down her sleeve, reverently laid her body back upon the cot, and stood gazing upon it--the image of utter despair. "Dear friend, be comforted. Oh, be sure it is better as it is," prayed Constance, through her streaming tears.- "Dead, dead! and alone in her prison cell," said Francis Heath, gazing in anguish upon the lovely, lifeless form. "Ohl take comfort. It is well that her sorrows are all over; that she is safe forever in the bosom of her Lord." ,'Dead and alone' in her prison cell,'^ reiterated Francis Heath, mechanically gazing upon the beautiful wreck before them. "The angel of :;od came down and delivered her from prison; and all is well with her," said Constance, still seeking to ameliorate the dreadful despair of the mourner. But he stood as if frozen to the spot, gazing upon the rigid form. As yet the news of her -death had not spread even through the prison. /  &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7861-00000173"/> Torn Turner stood at the cell door, with his thin, IaOp face still more contracted through sorrow and sympathy, when the step of the jailer was heard along the lobby. He came, followed by an officer. Evidently neither of them knew any thing of what had occurred; for as they approached the cell, the sheriff said to the jailer.. 'Go in, if you please, and let the prisoner know that she should be ready in fifteen minutes to take the road." But as they appeared at the door, Constance met them, and  said           -' "Mr. Wardour, your prisoner has escaped yon." "Escaped!" re-echoed the officer, in consternation. "Aye, she is at liberty."  "At liberty!" "Even so; her case has been reviewed by a higher tribunal; her sentence has been reversed by a  higher Judge, from whose decision there is no appeal." s '"bMadam, what mean you?" asked the officer, in vague foreboding.  "Come and see," said Constance. They entered the cell.  Dead!" exclaimed the sheriff, in horror, as his eye fell upon the figure on the cot. "Dead " "Nay,?' replied Constance, solemnly, " the damsel is not dead, butliberated., In deep awe the sheriff drew nearer and gazed upon the lovely, lifeless form lying extended on the cot, as still, as cold and white as some beautiful marble effigy; and then silently withdrew from the cell. It was then that Tom Turner, looking from the window, saw Dr. Horne, and uttered his name. At the sound of that name, Francis Heath suddenly raised his head like a staunch hunter that sniffs the game, and starting up from his kneeling posture beside the cot, he rushed to the window:and looked out, and then darted   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        B65 from the cell. And in less time' than it will take to write the words, he was heard hastening up the stairs, and dragging something along the lobby. And the next instant he appeared at the door, his complexion livid, his eyes blazing, his arm nerved by fierce anger, his hand upon the collar of Dr. Horne, whom he literally dragged, trembling, cowering, and almost unresisting, into the cell. "Forcing him to the side of the cot, he pointed to the lifeless figure and said- "There, murderer, look upon your work 1" "Madman I let go my collar!" gasped the strongly- agitated man, feebly struggling. But the hand that was upon him was like the hand of a giant. "Look upon your worki"  he repeated, in a hoarse whisper; "and after this looking, for you, and from me, there will be yet another,--'a fearful looking for of judg- ment 1 " and tightening his grasp, he raised and hurled the miscreant with such force from the cell that he fell prostrate upon the floor of the lobby. Those who beheld this scene, regarded it with breathless amazement. That. Dr. Horne, a fine, athletic man, should have suffered himself to be dragged like a slave to the cell of his victim, held there and forced to look upon her, and then hurled like a dog through the door; that his face should -have blanched, his teeth chattered, and his frame shake, so as to leave him powerless in the grasp of his enemy-was incomprehensible. They looked after him, saw him lift himself from his humbled position, and heard him mutter, u"He is mad; he need not be minded," as he slunk away from the spot. They could not understand it. After the delay of several hours, consumed in the usual medical investigations, the body of Alice was pronounced quite dead, and given up to the disposalof her friends.  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7861-00000174"/> CHAPTER XXXIX. How sweet her sleep where all is peace, Where sorrow cannot reach her breast Where all life's idle throbbings cease, And pain is lulled to rest-- Such balmy rest, where, peril-past, / The weary wins a deep repose, And the bruised spirit finds at last A care for all its woes. The breath of slander cannot come To break the calm that lingers there, There is no dreaming of her doom, No waking to despair; No calumny can wound her more, And all earth's bitterness is o'er. How sweet that deep repose to gain, And slumber in that deathless sleep, From which shoe'll never wake to pain And never rise to weep; For she's won her way thro' the tempest's roar, And laid her down on the golden shore. To avoid annoyance from the curiosity of the crowd, it was arranged    that the body of Alice Heath    should be re- moved   under the shadow   of night from  the prison to the house of her husband. Accordingly, at ten     o'clock, when  all the village was still, the fair form   of the unfortunate   girl, arrayed  in its grave clothes, was tenderly deposited in a coffin, reverently borne out, and placed in the hearse that waited! before the gate, and slowly driven    down the street towards the doc- tor's dwelling. Francis Heath, broken     in heart and  crushed  in spirit, 'walked   mou'rnfully with  uncovered  head' beside it until it :egached his own door. :-'Then the coffin was taken out of the hearse; and rever, 'ently borne into the house, deposited       upon  a table in thf- (366), ,   THE  GIPSY'S PrOPIECY.       367  centre of the front room on the left-hand side of the en- trance-hall, and directly opposite the furnishedparlor, to which Alice, as a "mourning bride," had been first intro- duced. This room was very nearly bare of furniture, but the care of the old housekeeper had kindled a fire and placed chairs around the hearth for the watchers. When the bearers of the coffin had placed their precious burden on the table, they looked at the heart-broken young husband for further orders. "I thank you, there is nb more that you can do to-night. The funeral will move from this house to Gwyn Old Church on Monday. Request your master to call on me here to- morrow morning for further instructions," said the doctor. The undertaker's men bowed in silence and withdrew, leaving the bereaved alone with his dead. The room was dimly lighted by the fire that smouldered in the grate and the two sperm candles that burned upon the mantel-shelf. 'The coffin, as I said, was placed upon the long table in the centre of the room, with its head towards the front window and its foot towards the fireplace. The coffiin-lid had been adjusted to its place, but was not finally screwed down. By- the light of the mantel-candles Francis .Heath approached the coffin and turned down the lid to indulge :his sorrow with one more look upon the fair face of his dead wife. There she layher pure, pale forehead -crowned with its "aureole of ebon--locks,'her slender, black -eye-brows gently arched, her sweet eyes closed, until the the long black lashes lay like ink-lines upon her white cheeks, her delicate, full lips sadly shut, and -her fair hands meekly folded on her patient bosom. The vision overwhelmed her husband, who threw himself  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7861-00000175"/> ' 3 68  THE  GIPSY'S P'ROPHECY. on the coffin, and gave way to a bitter paroxysm of grief, exclaiming- "Oh, my broken lily I Oh, my murdered love I my murdered love!" with other expressions of wild despair. Long and bitterly he sobbed and groaned, until the storm of sorrow, exhausted by its-own violence, left him still and mute, kneeling beside the coffin, with his head bowed upon the breast of the dead. He remained thus until he was recalled to himself by a hand laid gently on his shoulder, and a voice saying kindly in his ear--*. "Master Francis." It was his old housekeeper that stood with motherly solicitude beside him." "Is it you, Martin? Well, what do you want?" said the heart-broken man, raising his head. "Master Francis, you are a physician and a Christian; and as both, you ought to know that it is neither good for the body nor the soul to give way to grief and despondency. Moderate grief is natural; but yours is extravagant. Is death such a strange thing that a Christian man should break his heart and craze his brain about it? Men lose their wives, and women lose their husbands, and both lose their children by death every day ;-such is the will of God that cannot be withstood; but they do not lose their reason too." "Ah, Martin, but this is no ordinary death. This is the work of wicked men; she has been martyred. No, this is no ordinary visitation of God, to which one feels-he must submit." "On the contrary, I think it is a distinct visitation of. God, made in great mercy. Persecuted as she was, poor dear child, delivered over to the strong arm of law, from which even her husband could not deliver her, was it not well that the Lord himself set her free by death? Look   THE   -GIPSY'S pRo  PHECY.     389 at the heavenly calm on this sweet pale face," said the housekeeper, approaching, and turning down the covering. "When did you ever see this face look so serene and quiet? Nothing can disturb her more; she has gone 'where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest,"' concluded the good woman, reverently covering the beauti.- ful dead face. "'Where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest,'" repeated the young man, in a voice of rever- ential tenderness; "and no sufferer on earth ever more needed such a refuge. This was what she sighed for, prayed for. But woe, woe to those who have hunted the poor fawn to her grave 1" "The Lord who has taken her into His rest will deal with them in His own time; leave them to Him. And ;now, Master Francis, it is fitting I should know who is to watch to-night?" "I myself I I will never more leave her until the grave hides her from me." is Master Francis, you will never do such a thing. It is very wrong so to tax your.. firmness. Think of the lonely watches of the night; think what your feelings must be, left here in solitude and silence beside your dead? You cannot. go through with it; your health and your very reason will be endangered," urged the housekeeper. ' Martin, I trust that I am stronger than your doubts would make me believe. At any rate, I am resolved to watch to-night by the dead body of my Alice," replied the young man, in a tone that would admit of no farther dis- pute.  "At least, Master Francis, come out and take some- thing; your supper has been laid in the parlor for the last two hours." "No, no, I cannot eat; do not trouble me, good Martin."' "Ah, sir, but to keep up your strength."  &#xD;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7861-00000176"/>  30?    THE GIPSY'S PROPHECY. "Do not worry me, Martin; there, it is time for you to go home. Good-night." "Master Francis, I shall not leave the house to-nifght," said the old woman firmly. "Well, do as you like, good Martin, only leave me with my dead." With a sigh the housekeeper withdrew, but presently afterwards returned, bearing a cup of coffee in her hand, which she urged upon the sufferer with such affectionate solicitude that, to get rid of her importunities, he took the cup mid hastily drank off its contents. "And now, Master Francis," said Martin, as she received the cup back from his hands, "I shall watch by the kitchen fire in case you should need me; and I shall leave the supper arranged in the parlor in case you should want refreshments. And so I will not intrude on you any longer, but bid you good-night." "Good-night, good-night, Martin; you are a good woman, and I thank you, but I am best alone."  And Martin softly withdrew, leaving the bereaved young husband as he wished to be, alone with his dead wife. It was now  about half-past eleven o'clock; the fire smouldered dully in the grate, and the candles burned but dimly on the mantle-piece. The room was in semi-obscu- rity, but its very gloom, so congenial to his mood, had an almost soothing effect upon his lacerated feelings. He drew forward an arm-chair to the side of the coffin, and -sat down with his face towards the vailed face of the dead. He heard Martin close up the parlor and pass into the kitchen, closing the door behind her. That was the last sound that he heard, for after that, all, both within and without the house, was as silent as the grave. The mourner sat beside the corpse, sunk into that still and mute despair that followed his first wild burst of sorrow.  She for whom he loved to live and- labor was   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. G87 dead--dead in her youth, beauty, and innocence; driven to death by the hands of wicked omen, and his own heart seemed dying in his bosom. Henceforth, for him the world had no high ambitions, life no bright hopes. One purpose only made itself felt in his benumbed heart-to unmask and bring to justice the atrocious wretch whose machinations and perjhries had destroyed the repu- tation, liberty, and life of a most innocent and most beloved wife. Yes, he would live to investigate that dark mystery, to vindicate the honor of his lost Alice, and bring her de- stroyer to justice. And then he would leave for ever the dread scene of his unspeakable sorrows, and, in some far-distant clime, seek to dull the achings of his own heart by ministering to the heartaches of-others, and so wear out his life in works of charity. Long, long he remained plunged in this deep despair, through which, as spectres through shades, his gloomy thoughts moved. Meanwhile, the smouldering fire and the unsnuffed can- dles sent forth dull and fitful gleams of light, that caused the shadows to rise and waver, mop and mow upon the walls like evil spirits mocking human woe, and adding to the weird sombreness of the dread death-watch. So the hours of the night passed on. At length, with an insatiable hunger of the heart to behold the features of his beloved, the young man slowly arose, and once more-uncovered- the face of the dead, mur- muring- "Sweet, sweet face I oh, my darling, whither now has fled the pure spirit that lately looked forth fom-those closed eyes, spoke with those mute lips?

He remained gazing a long time in silence upon the beautiful, calm face, and then once more murmured.- "Is it well with you, my beloved? Is it well with you, my Alice?

Why did he start back and gaze like one bereft of his senses? Why did he murmur to himself.-  "Oh, it is just as old Martin said, this watch has been too much for my reason; my very senses play me false.' The lips that he had pressed were warm and elastic  tie next started from his panic-stricken attitude, rushed to the mantel-shelf, seized and snuffed the candle, and darted to the side of the coffin. Holding the candle so as to throw its full light upon the face within, he gazed intently upon it. That face had changed its aspect within the hour. The lips were warm and red, as with returning life; the cheeks i,. .   'THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        373 were fainly flushed; the eyes were half-unclosed, and soft and bright, as with a semi-consciousness of light. He gazed upon that face for a moment, while his heart beat so thick and fast that it threatened to suffocate him. He lifted one of her hands: it was warm and limber, and re- mained in his as if half-sensible of the hold Then the-truth rushed upon him with the force of an electric shock.     , She was not dead I she lived I This was one of those cases of catalepsy, or apparent death, of which he had met so, many in his medical read- ings, though he had never before seen one in his whole practice. "Not dead I not dead I Oh, my God, I thank Thee!" he cried, ,in a transport that shook his whole frame. Nothing but the imminent necessity of collecting and concentrating his faculties for this great crisis; of render- ing instantaneous aid to Alice, to 'fix the fluctuating flame of life that might pen yet expire; and of providing at once for her present and future security, could have enabled Francis Heath to conquer the storm of emotions in his own breast, and address himself prbmptly to the work of resus- citation. His heart still beat fast and thickly with the contending passions of astonishment, rapture, and terror--astonish- ment at the unexpected revival; rapture in the thought that Alice still lived; and terror in the possibility that she might again speedily sink into death, or live only to languish out her day- in a prison. , First to save her life and then to secure 'her flight and provide for her safety. These imminent necessities pressed upon- his heart with a force that calmed its wild throbbings, if it did not even stop the current of blood. All these rapid thoughts and emotions passed in one minute from the instant at which he had discovered hr  23  &#xD;<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7861-00000178"/> 87s4   THE  GI SY'S   PROPE CY. to be alive, for no more time did Francis Heath spend in inaction. First he glided swiftly and silently to the door of the kitchen, where Martin watched. He listened, ahd found by her deep breathing that the old woman was fast asleep in her chair. Then he sped silently back to the room of death, and carefully and tenderly lifted the light body of Alice from her premature coffin, and carried her up-stairs and laid her upon the bed. It was but the work of a moment to take off the frightful winding-sheet and shroud, and to wrap the chilled form" in a white flannel dressing- gown. There was a smouldering fire in the fireplace, the side bricks of which were old and worn. Francis Heath did not hesitate to take the poker and force out three or four hot bricks from the mouldering sides to wrap up in woolen clothes, and apply to the feet, knees, and shoulders of the cold form, as the speediest means of relief. Then from his medicine closet in the right hand of the chimney, he procured hartshorn, with which he briskly rubbed her temples and the palms of her hands, occasionally stopping to apply it to her nostrils. While thus engaged in trying to bring her back to full life and consciousness, he was hastily revolving in his mind whether he should take old Mrs. Martin into his confidence, or find some pretext to dismiss her from the house, so as to leave him a clear field for his operations. A little reflection, however, Was sufficient to convince him that he would never be able to conceal Alice without the assistance or connivance of a third party; and there was no one in the wAorld so likely to give him assistance and to keep his counsels as the old servant of his family, who had been devoted to him from his infancy, and had followed all the varying fortunes of his orphan boyhood and ih wfith unflinching steadfastness, and whose sympathies   ,THE  EGIPSY'S PROPHErCY.       875 had "been recently so deeply interested in the fate of his unhappy young wife. In a word -he determined to trust -Mrs. Martin with this precious secret. But for the present he would not leave Alice: her life was flowing slowly back. Her heart fluttered faintly, and her lungs trembled with the shock of the returning tide; then her fair face quivered, and her dark eyes opened and stared into vacancy. "Alice- Alice, love!" said her husband, addressing her in at low, cautious voice. The staring eyes lowered their glance to the level of his face, and softened into consciousness as they recognized him. "Alice, dear, Alice! how is it with you?" "Is it you, Francis, dear, only friend?" she murmured softly, keeping her eyes fixed upon him. "Yes, dear Alice; how are you?" "I-do not know; where am I?" she asked, with a bewildered look.  "You are in- your own- room at home, sweet Alice, and I am by your side," said Francis Heath, tenderly. a Yet, I fell asleep in my cell. How came I here?" "Your sleep was very sound, sweet Alice, and you were brought here during its continuance." "And would they let you do that? Oh, I was con- demned, you know, and was-to be sent--"She paused, and grew so deadly pale, that her husband became seriously alarmed, bjit composing himself, he answered, calmly- "Fear nothing, dear Slice, you are free! Nothing can harm you more." "Free! free I Did the pardon come at last?" she inquired, eagerly. "The order for your liberation came -last' night, dear Alice-(from God)," mentally added the young man. 1: i   &#xD;<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7861-00000179"/> 87B    THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY; "Free I free I oh, thank-thank Heaven!" exclaimed the poor girl, bursting into tears of joy." "But how is it with you, dear Alice? Are you in any pain? Is it difficult for you to speak?" "Oh, no, no; I am at ease, and so happy-so happy to be free, to be with you" "But you are weak!" "Oh, I feel faint and light; but that is nothing. I am so-so happy." He went to his medicine closet and poured out a cordial - which he caused her to drink.  Then he arranged her pillows, and said-- "Now, can you rest here quietly, dear Alice, while I go below to give some directions?" "Oh, yes, I shahl lie here, and return thanks to the Lord for my deliverance. But how strange it was that I should have slept so soundly as to be brought here without being awakened," she said, wonderingly. , "It was the deep sleep of an exhausted mind and body, dear Alice, so think no more about it, love," said Dr. Heath, tenderly smoothing her dark hair before he left the room.

When he entered the kitchen, he found the good woman still sleeping in her arm-chair in the corner. He shook her gently, saying- "Martin, Martin, wake up, good woman." She started, and rubbed her eyes, exclaiming-- "Is it you, Master Francis? What a night you must have had. What would you like? I will make you a cup of tea directly.". "Come into thej parlor with me, Martin, I have some- thing particular to say to you," replied the young man, gravely. The housekeeper arose and followed her young master. The parlor was just what it was described to be when poor Alice was first brought home. The sofa was drawn up on the left hand side of the fire- place, in which burned a low fire. An easy chair stood on the right hand side, and the table,.with its untasted supper, occupied the centre of the room. "Sit down here a moment, Martin, I wish to talk with you," said the doctor, indicating the sofa. The old woman obeyed; looking at the speaker with curious interest. "Martin," said Dr. Heath, seating himself beside her, "have you ever in your life heard of a case of suspended animation?" "Sir!" "Have you ever, then, heard of a case of apparent death?" "' Apparent death,' Master Francis?" "Yes, have you evr known an instance of a per- son lying apparently dead for hours and then recover- ing?" "Lord preserve your reason, Master Francis I I have heard of such things, but I never knew a case of the kind in my whole life.

Oh, I said this death-watch wasn't good for you," sighed the' old woman, uneasily, "Those cases of suspended animation, apparent death, or catalepsy, are well known to us of the medical profession, though unfrequent," said the doctor, while the old house- keeper continued to gaze upon him uneasily. "Such a case, Martin, has recently come to my know- ledge-a case that interests me more nearly than my own life. You have heard that your young mistress died sud- denly, or rather that she was found dead in her bed yester- day morning?" "Yes, yes, Master Francis. In the name of heaven, what is it that you are going to tell me?" "While I watched by the side of my young wife to-night I thought I detected in her signs of returning animation. A further examination proved my suspicions to be correct. Inca word, Martin, hers was a case of apparent death only, and she lives," said the young man, in a voice broken with, emotion. "Oh, Master Francis, can this be possible!" cried the old woman, trembling with agitation. "It is true as that I stand here. I took her from her coffin, bore her up, stairs, laid her on the bed, and removed the, erements of the grave from her sight before I brought her to the consciousness of surrounding circumstances. She, is awake now, but knows nothing of her supposed death and intended burial. She thinks that she bhas been pardoned, and has been brought here while in a deep sleep; and she must never know any better.,' The housekeeper could only stare at him in unutterable astonishment. '- And now, Martin, attend to me. I do think you love mer?" "I took you from your dear lost mother's breat when   THE-G   IPSY'S PROPHECY.       79 she died, Master Francis; I nursed you at mine, and I love you as my own son." '"I know you do; and I think also that you love the poor, innocent, unhappy girl whom I made my wife?" "I do, indeed, poor dear." "And you would do any thing in your power to save her from the dangers -that surround her?" "Indeed, heaven knows .that I would," said the house- keeper, fervently. ," Then, Martin, first of all you must swear that you will never divulge to a living creature the secret that I have told you to-night--the secret of my wife's recovered life." "May my body and soul perish the day that I divulge your secret, or do the least thing to betray you or her," said Martin, clasping her hands. "I trust you, else I had never told you so much as I have; nevertheless, Martin, I should rather you would bind your- self by a formal oath," said Dr. Heath, taking a copy of the Holy Scriptures from the book-shelf, and presenting it to the housekeeper. "Dictate the oath to me, Master Francis, and I will take it, though it cannot make me more faithful to your trust than I am already, for I am now as true and as devoted to you as ever was a mother to her son." 'f do not doubt you,-my good Martin; but I do not know to what extremities you may be forced by some judi- cial investigation. Therefore I would have you bind your soul by an oath that you cannot, dare not break," said the young man, placing the Holy Bible in her hand, and dictat- ing the form of the oath. "I hope that satisfies you, Master Francis; but as for me, you might have trusted me without it, for wild horses should not have drawn the secret from me,'" said Martin, when she had taken the oath.'

They separated about their several errands; Mrs. Martin went into the kitchen to prepare a basin of wine-whey; and Francis Heath passed out of the back door, and sought an old lumber-shed, where he found a log that suited his pur- pose. Bringing this into the house, he wrapped it first in a woolen table-cover, and then in a sheet, and placed it in the empty coffin, where he carefully fitted it, and closely covered it with a second sheet, tucking in the ends, to make all tight. Then he replaced the lid of the coffin, and screwed it securely down. He next raised it and satisfied himself that the muffled log did not shake about, and that its weight nearly corresponded to that of the body it re- placed. He then put the room in order and locked it up. He next went up-stairs to visit Alice, who, refreshed by a wash, a- change of clothes, and a basin of wine-whey, was now lying comfortably in bed, enjoying a light and easy slumber. Perceiving this, he beckoned Mrs. Martin to follow him, and led the way down stairs to the parlor, where they sat down for farther consultation. "You must know, Martin, that I have put a muffled billet, of wood of a good size in the coffin, and screwed it securely down. This will be supposed the dead body of your mistress, and the funeral must proceed as previously arranged. ----No one but you and myself must suspect that she has been really resuscitated and is now living." "I understand that, sir." "And when she is believed to be dead and buried rwe must take her off in the night to some place of concealment, where she may remain in safety until we can get her out of-the country.   'THE 'GIPSY'S   PROPHECY.      - 381 "Yes, sir, I see all that is necessary; but where can we take her?" That is what I have been thinking of , and wished to consult you upon. Is your old cottage in Horne's Htole let yet?" "Lord, no sir; ever since the murder of old'flugh Horne, and the finding of the clothes in the rock behind the hut, you couldn't get a living soul to go near it, much less live in it. 'The little place, used to bring me in a- good ten pound a year, and now it is as good as gone to me." "'Let me -see-that cottage I think is far removed from any human habitation, except the deserted house of Homorne's Hole?"' "Yes, sir; it is quite on the verge of the estate, a good mile from the Hall, and, indeed, it is nearer to Radnor; but Radnor is on the other side of the mountain, where there is no pass." "It is the very house for me. Is the furniture still in it?" "Lord, yes, sir; such as it is-plain stuff--all just as I left it when I came here to take care of this house.' "Then there we will go with our precious charge. I know that, however plain it may be, your furniture is clean and comfortable; and to your house will I take Alice, and leave her in your care until I can withdraw her' from 'the country. Being supposed dead and buried, there at least she can remain in concealment and safety. And now let us have a little breakfast, and address ourselves to the day's "The kettle is boiling, sir; and you shall be served in five minutes," said the housekeeper, hurrying to lay the cloth.  Dr. Heath, meanwhile, slipped up stairs to take another look at Alice. 'Finding her in a deep, healthful sleep, that was likely to last for hours, he locked:the door securely :  &#xD;<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7861-00000182"/> 382    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECy. the outside, put the key in his pocket for safety, and re. turned below to open the house. The sun was now rising, and the world was all astir * and Mrs. Martin had his breakfast ready in the parlor. After the morning meal, the doctor,. with many fresh charges of secresy and discretion to his housekeeper, went into the opposite room to await the coming of the under- taker. That functionary soon presented himself. After the usual lugubrious salutations, Dr. Heath said- 'In view of the distressing circumstances that attended my dear wife's fate, of course it is desirable that the funeral should be as unostentatious as possible. "Of course, of course, dear sir," groaned the undertaker. "To-morrow, therefore, attended by the two carriages requisite to convey the clergyman, myself, and the pall- bearers, it will proceed from  this house to 'wyn Old Churchyard, where I directed you to have a grave pre- pared. I -believe this is all I have to say. The details I will leave to your own discretion."  "i will attend to every thing with the greatest care and dispatch. And now I will not prolong a painful interview or intrude upon you longer," said the undertaker, rising to go. After his departure, Dr. Heath fastened up the front door, and had the house to himself and his small family for . the rest of the day. Hie went frequently to the door of Alice to, listen if she was awake. At last, towards mid. day, hearing her stir, he unlocked and entered the room.

It is like entering the heav'enly gates!" she finished, with the sigh of a great deliverance. He smiled on her, and smoothed her hair with his hand. Not for the world would he have hinted to her that she had really passed through the valley of the shadow of death to reach this rest and peace, or that her danger was not really past; that at any hour in which her existence might be casually discovered she was liable to arrest and imprison- ment to serve out the term of her sentence. No, she had naturally adopted the opinion that she had ,been pardoned and liberated, and not for the universe would he have disturbed her peace by telling her the con- trary. "Dear Francis,' she continued, with a smile of seraphic peace, 1' I feel so much lighter and more hopeful since I ala free; for though the pardon has not cleared me from the imputation of guilt, yet I feel sure in my own mind that I shall not long suffer under it. That man's conscience, seared as it is, cannot rest under the weight of so heavy a crime as that he has committed against me. It will force him to confess his own guilt and clear me. I feel as sure of what I say as I do of the existence of God." "I do believe, dear love, that "in the Lord's own time your innocence shall be made as clear as day," replied Dr. Heath, caressing her brow with his hand, "but in the meantime, my beloved Alice, you must not stay here amid scenes associated with so much injustice, persecutionaud misery.

I intend to take you to a quiet, secluded cottage among the mountains, where you are to remain to recruit your health for a few weeks under the care of Martin, while I settle up my busi- ness and prepare to emigrate to America. In that vigorous young republic, my Alice, I shall find a new and extensive field for endeavor. There I have no doubt I shall so rise in my profession as to attain that eminence which I covet only for your dear sake. There we shall forget all the dark troubles that we have left behind us, and commence a new existence." "Oh, Francis," she said, with her eyes fixed in unspeak- able affection on his face, "how good, and brave, and noble you are; how much I owe you; my life, and all that makes life of any worth. When I was a poor, lost girl, forsaken by all my friends, persecuted to death by evil men, falling into a horrible pit of destruction without a hand on earth to help a creature so lost and ruined-you, noble soul, believed in my innocence-you stretched forth your hand- and, though all the world cried shame upon you, you - snatched me from destruction, and drew me to the shelter of your own strong, noble heart. Oh, what can I render to you for all that you have done for me, my husband? All my love was yours before-all my life would not be enough. Oh, if I had my will, no one should ever wait on you but me-,no hands should even wash your feet but mine. Francis I Francis!" she cried, passionately, holding out her arms. He bowed his head to her caress, and while she held it to her throbbing heart, she burst into a passion of sobs and tears. "Compose yourself, dear love; you are my wife, my own; I was bound to rescue you or perish with you; I would have laid down my life for your liberty; and your love, dear Alice, is more than sufficient recompense for all.   THE  GIPSYS PROPHECY.       386 "My love, my life, my soul, would not be enough, Francis, Francis!" she cried, passionately clasping him to her breast, and dwelling on his name as if its very sound had a charm for her. "It is enough, my love; it is enough that you love me," he said. "And now, dear one, I have a favor to ask of you.?' "A favor? What is there you would ask of me that would not be a right?" "It is for your own sake that I ask it, my darling-for your own sake only. In a word, I wish you -to keep very quiet to-day and to-morrow. Do not rise from your bed to ring your bell, and do not call aloud, or even speak above a whisper. Will you promise me this?" is Certainly I will," said Alice, with a look of surprise, that she refrained from putting into words, but which he answered by saying- "The slightest exertion at present would be very injurious to you, my love; it 'is as your physician, as well as your husband, that I request this forbearance on your part." "I will obey you in both capacities," she said, in a sub- dued voice, adding, with a smile, the question, "Do I speak low enough?" "Quite, my love, and this restraint will only be required of you for a few hours."

THE next day, at the appointed hour, the few devoted friends of Francis Heath and Alice assembled to pay what they supposed to be the, last tribute of respect to the de- parted. The hearse and the two carriages were drawn up before the house. In the front room were assembled a small party, consist- ing of the old curate who had performed the marriage ceremony between Francis Heath and Alice Owen, the two old ladies who had witnessed the rites, Mrs. Mostyn, Mr. and Mrs. Wardour, and lastly, Dr. Heath and Mrs. Martin. The coffin being already screwed down, there seemed to be no possibility of detecting the pious- fraud that had rescued Alice from  a living death, -nevertheless the heart of Francis Heath stood still with intense anxiety during the progress of the funeral solemnities. Once his conscience smote him for keeping the secret from one who had been his friend through all his trials- it was at the end of the service, and just before the coffin was to be carried out, when Constance Mostyn bent over it, weeping abundant tears of sincere sympathy and regret. Willingly would he- have dried those-tears by telling Mrs. (386)   THE  GIPSY'  s PROP  tHECY.   887 Mostyn that she for whom they were shed was living and at peace, but that he judged it better to be silent. Constance remained at the house with the old house- keeper, while the funeral procession moved to the church- yard, and when the obsequies were quite over, and Dr. Heath returned, she was there to tender' him a sister's sympathy and services. Again Francis Heath felt a strong temptation to tell her the truth, but again prudence prevailed over impulse, and he thanked Mrs. Mostyn earnestly for all her kindness, and suffered her to depart unenlightened. At last, then, once more he had the house to himself for the execution of his plans for the safety of Alice, First, he went up stairs to speak to her from whom the solemn ceremonies of the day had kept him several hours absent. He found her cheerful and very much restored. "You have had some friends to see you down stairs. I heard people coming and going," she said, in the low tone that had been prescribed for her. "Yes, dear Alice, it was a consultation; but you need- not constrain yourself to speak in a low voice any longer. You are so well and strong now that you may speak as usual." "I am very glad, for to tell the truth, I found it more fatiguing to suppress my voice all the time than to speak naturally."      ...  "Doubtless; and now, my dear Alice, I have to propose to you to get up' and dress, and prepare yourself for a night journey." :         "A night journey?" she said, in surprise. "Yes, love ; the reason is,-that in our painful circum- stances I do not wish to attract attention by driving through the town and along the highway in broad day; light."  &#xD;<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7861-00000185"/> 388    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. She looked wistfully at him for a few moments, and then said- "Francis, dear; let there be no secret between you and me; it costs you too much, beloved." "Alice,-Alice i" he interrupted, in a voice of entreaty, but she went on. "Your stealthy and hurried manner; your ill-concealedl agitation; your injunction upon me of silence or suppressed tones; this journey under the shadow of night, all point to a fact  "Alice, Alice, the hankering of a woman after for- oidden knowledge first brought ruin and death unto the world "d "[ know it, but this is not forbidden knowledge, neither would I speak of it did I not already possess it, and did I not see how much pain it costs you to keep the supposed secret from me. Confess, then, that poor Alice has not been pardoned, but that her deliverer has effected her es- cape in some other way. Is it not so?" His silence seemed to admit the fact; and Alice, though she had suspected this, grew pale at the confirmation of her fears. "And these people that were coming and going down stairs were here with a search-warrant to look for me?" she said, becoming deathly white. "No, no, Alice, my poor fawn, you will never be hunted again. You are  --safe , believe me." "I am safe, since you say so, though I do not under- -stand how that can be, since I am not pardoned," she said, in perplexity. She knew so much, that he judged it best for her peace that she should know all. He'therefore said- "Alice, they will never concern themselves in any way about you again, unless you choose to present yourself before them. They believe you beyond all earthly laws.   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        389 You fell into a cataleptic fit, which was supposed to be death. After some investigation and some delay and for- malities, during which you lay as one dead, you were given up to my disposal. I brought you here, dear Alice, and was so happy as to recover you. That is the whole truth. You have only to keep out of sight for a few days, until I can arrange my business and get you off to America." "And that subdued bustle down stairs-I guess what it was now!" said Alice, in a tone of deep awe. "It was a pious fraud, my love, if ever there was such a thing." "And we must set forth to-night to seek a place of con- cealment?" "Yes, dear; the cottage in the mountains, of which I told you, where you will remain under the care of good Mrs. Martin, who is the only one besides ourselves that is- in possession of the secret. You are strong enough for the drive?" "Oh, yes I and I thank you so very much for telling me every thing. I shall know how to govern myself now." Francis Heath called Martin in to assist Alice to dress and to put up the few necessaries that they required to take with them, while he himself went into the back yard to make his preparations. In the coach-house there was an old carriage, in tolera- ble repair, that had once been thee property of Dr. Heath's predecessor, but that had been purchased with the other fixtures and movables appertaining to the premises. Dr. Heath's horses were in the stable. Not daring in this emergency to take any one into his confidence, or even to call in the assistance of a laborer, Francis Heath drew out the old coach, and put the horses to it. His next care was to pack into it a supply of food,- wine, and candles, to last for several days. Having eom- 24  &#xD;<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7861-00000186"/> 890    THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY. pleted these arrangements, he went up stairs to' see how Alice was progressing, and to wait the hour of setting forth.           - At ten o'clock, therefore, when all the village was still, they had first a comfortable supper in the kitchen, and then Dr. Heath put out the fire and lights, locked up the house, took Alice out from the back door, where the old coach waited, placed her, well wrapped up, on the back seat, with a hot brick at her feet, put Martin in with her, mounted the box himself, drove out at the stable-gate, and so commenced their night journey.,   . It was about eleven o'clock, and very dark, when the coach passed down the village. It would have been impossible for any one at that hour to recognize Dr. Heath, disguised as he was in a coach- man's box-coat, with the collar turned up and around the lower part of his face, and his hat pulled down low over his brows; and if any late passenger had chanced to recog- nize the coach, there was nothing in the event of the doctor's carriage being out late at night to attract atten- tion, far less to awaken suspicion. Thus the carriage passed unnoticed through the almost deserted streets, and took the road leading to Horne's Hole. When they had got about a mile from the town, Francis Heath stopped and lighted the lamps of the carriage, a convenience of which he had not ventured to avail him- self while still passing through the town and its suburbs, but which the difficulties of the road now rendered indis- pensable. Those difficulties increased with every quarter of a mile as 'they passed through the broken country ap. proaching the range of mountains in which their place :f was situated. - Often Francis Heath had to get off the box and:ear efully lead his horses up and down the steepest of the hills.   T-HE GIPSY'S PROPHrEt.        BiY At about one o'clock the -moon arose and shed. its welcome light upon their rugged way. But even with this new aid, the care required by the roughness of the way rendered their progress so slow, that the day was faintly dawning in the east when they began to descend the perilous pass that, led down into the deep and rocky glen known as Horne's Hole. Here Dr. Heath was obliged, for the -last time, to get off and lead his horses down the steep and rugged road, while old Martin held her breath for fear, and Alice prayed for their preser- Vation. - At last the foot of the mountain was reached in safety. Francis Heath remounted the box, turned the horses' heads to the right, and drove for some distance close under the ridge, until he reached a point where the mountain seemed cloven in two, the cleft forming a narrow wooded valley, at the furthest extremity of which was the cottage to which they were bound. As the mouth of this valley was thickly choked with a growth of evergreens, no carriage could by any means enter it. They were obliged, therefore, to draw up at its entrance and alight.- Francis Heath drew Alice's arm within his own, and led the way, while old Martin followed, laden with as many packets as she could carry. A walk of about one-eighth of a mile through the thicket brought them to the head of the valley, where, close against the junction of the moun- tains, and in about an acreof eleared ground, stood the solitary cottage in .which they sought refuge for Alice. Nothing could be more lonely and desolate than the aspect of this dwelling, surrouided as it was on three sides by in? accessible rocks, and approached on the fourth through a thick wood.. "Have you the key, Martin?" inquired Dr. Heath, when they had passed :through the broken gate up the grass-grown garden-walk to the door of the cottage.  gra  &#xD;<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7861-00000187"/> 892'   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY, "Oh, yes, sir," said the old woman, producing a large ,rusty key, that, being fitted to the lock, presently gave them admission to a small, narrow passage, having a room on each side. Opening the door on the right, they entered a good. sized kitchen,- plainly furnished, and with its furniture covered with the dust of many months. Dr. Heath placed Alice in the settle beside the chimney, wrapped her carefully up, and turning to his housekeeper, said-    . "It is no time for ceremony, Martin, we must make a fire with the first thing we can find for the purpose." He proceeded to break up the old chair, the fragments of which he piled upon the hearth. - Then taking from his pocket the necessary apparatus for the purpose, he struck a light and kindled a fire, that soon sent its cheerful light and warmth through the damp, deserted room. "Now, Martin, my good woman, get things into a little order here, while I go back to the carriage to fetch the remainder of the packets," said Francis Heath, leaving the cottage. He was gone about fifteen minutes, and when he returned, so well had the good woman employed the time, that the furniture-was dusted, the cloth laid for breakfast, and the kettle hung over the fire. Wfhile waitiniig for the water to boil, Mrs. Martin showed Alice into the large bed-room on the opposite'side of the little passage, where she laid off her bonnet and wrappings. Meanwhile, Francis Heath went out and gave his horses a feed. .-..  . . When he returned, a comfortable breakfast of coffee, toast, ham, and eggs was ready upon the table. e would not permit Alice to stir from the arm-chair, b 'dt drew her,;seated as, she was, to the side of the table nearest the fire.-    THE  GIPSY'S   PROPHECY,      893 With an almost motherly care he selected the nicest slice of ham, and the clearest poached egg, and the most delicate piece of buttered toast for her plate, and said, smiling-- "Now, dearest Alice, whether you are hungry or not, if you care for me, you will eat. An indolent appetite should no more be indulged in its apathy than a greedy one in its voracity; both extremes are bad, and should be governed by reason." And with his own hand he placed a cup of fragrant coffee beside her plate, and waited to see her commence eating before he would touch his own breakfast. More to please him than to satisfy herself, Alice drank a little coffee, and put a morsel of ham to her lips; and she soon found as he had said, that with the tasting of food her torpid appetite revived, and with it her depressed spirits were raised. She made a good breakfast, and the meal passed off cheerfully. When breakfast was over, and the table cleared away, Dr. Heath sat himself down beside Alice's arm-chair, and called Mrs. Martin to join them, as he wished to take her into their consultation. When the fatigued housekeeper had gladly sunk into a seat on the other side of the doctor, the latter said- "Now, my dear Alice, and my good Martin, I must hurry away as soon and as fast as I can, therefore I want you to attend to the directions I have to give you for your safety." "Must you indeed go so soon, sir?" inquired Martin, while Alice looked pleadingly into bhis face, but said' no- thing. "Yes, unfortunately, yes; I must go for many impera- tive reasons. In the first place--secluded and unfre- quented as this pass is, I dare not leave my carriage at Its b  &#xD;<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7861-00000188"/> 394    THE' GIPSY'S   PROPHECY. entrance, lest some early passenger might chance to come this way, and see it.' "And, oh, dear I to think that there is no room to get it into the thicket and hide it," said Martin, with a groan, "No; but when I return I will come on horse-back, for I can bring a horse quite through the thicket, and put him into the shed behind the cottage. But there are other, and even more exigent reasons, why I must return at once. It is necessary that I should show myself at Gwyn as early as possible to-day, so that I shall not be missed and my absence commented upon. I must by every care, avoid attracting attention and inquiry. Why do you look so sad, sweet Alice? There is no danger, love; only a need of prudence for awhile," said Francis Heath, affectionately taking her hand. "It is not that, dear Francis; it is not that. I am thinking of the care and trouble I am-to you," she answered, with tears suffusing her dark eyes. "Think not of that, love; it is care and trouble willingly undertaken; think riot of it, it is only for a season; think of the comfort and happiness you will be to me for long years after we shall have attained the refuge of another country. And now, dear one, I must bid you farewell for the present; but one word before I go. Lonely as this cottage is, and unliliely as any stranger is to approach it, still, for your safety, I must beg that you will not show yourself outside the door, or even at one of the windows? Can you forbear so much, sweet Alice?;' "Oh, yes. You delivered me from a close prison; then from a grave; can I not bear the light restraint you enjoin upon me?" "'Twill be but a few days, dear Alice. Martin," he said, turning to the housekeeper. "TYes, sir." ' I look to you to watch over the safety and welfare of   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.         398 your mistress. Keep the window-sashes fastened down, and keep- light curtains drawn before them so as to ex- clude the view but not the light. Keep every door fast- ened, and if any one by any unforeseen possibility should come to the cottage, let your mistress lock herself in her room before you open the cottage door. Now, Martin, be sure to attend strictly to these instructions." "I will indeed, sir. You may depend upon every thint being done as though you saw it yourself." "If any of the country people should chance to hear that you have returned, and should come to see you, take the precautions that I have ordered for the concealment and security of your mistress, and then explain your return by saying that you have come back upon account of your master's resolution to break up his establishment and go to foreign parts." "Which will be the truth as far as it goes, sir. But I think that there is not the least reason to fear any one coming near the coftag:. It is so out of the way, that in the best of days no one ever came here. more than half-a- dozen times a year. And a:fter the murdered man's clothes were found in the cleft of tWie rock behind the shed no one ever came near the place.

"Yes, yes," said Francis Heath, who could not endure the least reference to.!)r. Horne, especially in the presence Oof Alice. "Yes, yes, I do believe you are perfectly safe; nevertheless, to make assurance doubly sure, do just as I direct you." , You may rely upon me, sir."

I shall be with you again early to. morrow morning." And after tenderly embracing his wife, and shaking hands with Mrs. Martin, Dr. Heath left the cottage and took his way down the narrow glen. CHAPTER XLII. And she was lost, and yet I breathed, But not the breath of human life.-Byron. IT was a gorious morning, one of those mornings that sometimes come to brighten the gloom of winter, making it gladder than the spring. The clear blue dome of heaven seemed raised to an infinite height; the newly-risen sun shone dazzlingly down  upon mountain and valley, wood and waterfall. One might almost fancy he heard, amid the crisp rustling of the frosted trees and the merry ripple of the streams, the voices of wood-nymyhs and water-spirits singing in their glee. It was a morning to cheer the sad- dest heart, and to intoxicate the gayest. Francis Heath was sinfgularly sensitive to the influences of nature, and at any other time his soul would have sung within liim in unison with the concert of gladness around. But now, as he left behind him the cottage that contained his- concealed wife, his heart sank under an oppression of spirits much greater than the occasion explained. A deep presentiment of approaching woe and irremediable calamity overshadowed his soul. In vain he tried to dispel the gloom and throw off the weight that darkened, and bur- dened his bosom. 'She is safe"-thus he reasoned with his feelings-   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPrHECY.      397 ' perfectly safe. No one suspects her existence, so no one will ever think of pursuing her. The cottage is secure and secluded. It is next to impossible that any one should approach this vale, or, if they did, should recognize or even see her. -And yet--and yet---" He paused for a moment, and then turning and quickly retracing his steps, went back to the cottage. He passed into the little wooden gate, and looked cu- riously at the front of the house. There was but one door, with a window each side of it, the rght hand window being that of the kitchen, the left hand one that of the bed-room. They were thrown into deep shadow by a stooping shed over the rude porch in front of the cottage, and white cur--, tains were drawn in the inside to exclude the gaze of any creature that might chance to be without. "They have -obeyed my instructions thus far," said Francis Heath, as he stepped into the porch and knocked at the door. A delay of some minutes ensued, and then the door was opened by Mrs. Martin, who, looking hurried and- alarmed, exclaimed- "Good gracious I is it you, Master Francis? How you frightened me I I thought it was some stranger. Have you forgot:any thing V" "No; I came back to reiterate my cautidans about the safe keeping of your mistress." "Lord I Master Francis, can't you trust me?" "Yes; but I wish to give you some additional instruc: tions for the security of Alice. I wish you to make up a second bed in her chamber and sleep there to-night;" "I intended to do that, sir, any how." "Where is your mistress? I must see her for a mo. ment." "Locked in her room, sir, as you ordered if ever a rap should come to the door."  &#xD;<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7861-00000190"/> 898    THE  G IPSY'S  PROPHECY. "Right," said Dr. Heath, passing into the passage, rap. ping at the left hand door, and saying- "Alice, my dear, it is I come back to speak to you a moment. Let me in." The door was opened by Alice, who looked pale with fear. "I have alarmed you, my love," he said. "I thought it was some one else," faltered Alice. "I came back to give a few more directions to Martin, and to hear you promise again not to leave the house for a moment during my absence." "' I will not cross the threshold of my door until I see you again. I pledge you my word and honor that I will not;. so trust me and be satisfied, dear Francis," said Alice, earnestly. He did trust her, but he was not satisfied. And so he made her reiterate again and again her promise not to ]  e't- the: house, nthr five to appear at a door or window, until she should see him again. And then he kissed her once more, commended her to the protection of heaven and the care of Mrs. Martin, anid for the second time took his leave and departed.

He put up his carriage and horses, refreshed himself with a cold lbin'chbion and a glass of wine, and then set out to call upon his patients, in which occu- pation we must leave him for a few hours while we return to the two lonely women in the glen cottage. The forenoon was passed by Mrs. Martin in cleaning and putting into some order the small, neglected house. Alice pressed her own assistance upon the good woman, but Mrs. Martin pleaded her master's orders, and would not suffer   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHEC'Y.        899 her mistress to do aught but quietly rest in. the arm-chair in the chimney-corner, only leaving it to draw up to the table at noon to partake of the boiled partridge and glass of sherry that the careful housekeeper had got ready. The afternoon was passed in completing the work of the morning. After an early tea, Mrs. Martin carefully secured the doors and windows of the house, -covered the kitchen fire, and attended Alice to the sleeping-chamber that they were to occupy in compan For the explanation of what is to follow it is necessary to describe this room. It was situated on the left side of the small passage. It had but one window, a large one, which looked upon the front porch; but it had two doors, the first or side door opening from the narrow passage that divided it from the kitchen, and the second, or back door, on the left of the fire-place,. opening into0 a small yard in the rear of the cottage, which fan back to' the rocky ptecipice, in a cleft- of which had been fourid the blood-stained clothes of the murdered miser.  The room was very plainly furnished, having only the'curtained bedstead that stood in the front corner of the room with its head against the front wall to the right iof the window, a plain dressing-table, a wash- stand, a few chairs, and a small cot bedstead that stood in the recess to the right 6f fthe fire-place, where &amp; bright little wood-fire added clleerfulness to the apartment. The first care of Mrs. Martin on entering the room was to' assure herself by a second examination that the doors: and windows were rEally fast. . Having satisfied herself upon these important points, she next assisted her'mistress to undress and get to :bed. Lastly, she drew the curtains carefully around Alice, and leaving her to repose, betook, herself to her own cot bed- stead.  &#xD;<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7861-00000191"/> 400,   THE  GIPSY?'S PROPHECY' Exhausted by the great fatigue of the last two days and- nights, Mrs. Martin fell into a deep and dreamless sleep, that lasted until late in the morning, and how much longer it would have continued is uncertain, for she was only at lengthy awakened by a loud and prolonged knocking at the outer door, attended with a voice, calling-- "Martin, Martin I in the name of heaven, woman, are you dead or in a trance-coma? - "Coming, sir-coming immediately," answered Mrs. Martin, hurrying on her clothes, as she recognized the voice of her master. "It is a world's wonder he had not waked up his wife," said Martin, glancing uneasily at the curtains of Alice's bed, from which no sound came. "If I slept fast, I know who sleeps faster," she added, as she hurried out into the passage, and unbarred and unlocked the front door to admit, Francis Heath. "Good Heaven, Martin, how late you sleep and how soundly. I have been rapping, and calling, and shaking at this door for the last half-hour, I do really believe," said the doctor, impatiently.  "I was so very tired, quite worn out, sir, indeed," said the housekeeper, apologetically. "I believe you, poor soul. You have had a fatiguing time of it,' said the doctor, quite mollified. "How is your mistress?" he asked, dismounting, and passing into the kitchen. "As well as possible, I think, sir. She sleeps sounder than I did, for even your loud knocking and calling did not awaken her," said Mrs. Martib, as she bustled about, open. ing the kitchen window-shutters, and then proceeding to light a fire on the hearth. "Why, it is eleven o'clock," exclaimed the doctor. "I will go and see how my sleeping beauty fares," he added,   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.'       401:' mentally, as he passed out of the kitchen, and entered the chamber of his wife. With a half-suppressed smile upon his lips, he approached the bed, and drew the curtains, to gaze upon her as she: slept. The next instant, he started back in surprise and' alarm. The bed had been slept in, but was now empty. He glanced around the room. There was not a crevice or an article of furniture that would for a moment have hidden her from his view. He next observed with anxiety that the back door of the chamber was slightly ajar. He went to it immediately, and passed into the small back yard. This yard was very circumscribed, enclosed in the front by the wall of the cottage, on the back by the frowning' precipice, and on each side by two low stone'fences, There was no out-house, no place of concealment within it, no gate or door of egress from it. "She is not there; but I am wrong to be anxious; nothing can have happened to her. She probably grew tired of lying still, and not wishing to disturb Mrs. Martin, she arose early, and is doubtless in some part of the house," said Francis Heath to himself, as he hastily returned to the kitchen, where Martin was getting breakfast. "Your mistress is up, she has been up some time, pro- bably, but she is not in her room. Where can she possibly be?" he inquired of Mrs. Martin. "My mistress up, and not in her chamber? Impossible, sir; for when I got up, nobody had left the room, for I found the door fastened securely on the inside, just as I left it when I went to bed. ': "It was?" exclaimed Dr. Heath, his surprise and alarm growing every instant greater. "Surely, yes, sir." "And the back door?" "I fastened it securely last night, sir."  &#xD;<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7861-00000192"/> 4)2   THME  GIPS-YS PROPHECY., "Did you open it this morning?'" "No, sir; I have not been near it this morning." "And yet it was ajar I ajar, and your mistress nowhere visible I Good Heaven, woman, what is the meaning of this-?" asked Dr. Heath, bending his brows sternly upon the housekeeper. "Oh, good gracious, sir I don't frighten me so I perhaps she is in the back yard 1" said Mrs. Martin, trembling. "She is not I I have searched it I And you say she could not have passed through the passage door, which you found fastened," cried Francis Heath, in a voice of dis. traction. "Oh, sir, she might have slipped out while I was letting you in I She may have slipped up into the loft, or gone into the scullery., I will run and see; she must be in the house, you know 1 It is impossible to be otherwise." "It would seem so, indeed," said Dr. Heath, striving in vain to conquer what he supposed to be an unreasonable anxiety, as he followed. his housekeeper up into the spa- cious loft that occupied the inside of the whole roof above both the kitchen and the bed-room. It was bare of furni- ture, so they saw at a glance that she whom they sought was not there. ' Don't be alarmed, Master Francis, she is in the scul- lery, perhaps," faltered the housekeeper, hurrying down tairs, followed quickly by Dr. Heath. But Alice was not in the scullery. And there was not another hiding-place in the whole of the small cottage. Pr. Heath and his old servant looked at each other in consternation. "It cannot be possible that she got up and dressed her- self, and went out for a morning walk, contrary to my pro- hibition and her promise; and yet I do not see what else can have become of her!" said the doctor, in an agony of anxiety.   T HE  GIrsY'S   PROP-HECY.     40A8 "I will run into her room and see, sir,': said the house. keeper, hurrying away, followed as before by the -half-dis- tracted husband. "No, sir I! see I here is her bonnet and shawl, and even her dress and under-skirts, and her very sleeves and collar, just as I took them off her last night; and here, on the dressing-table, is her black chenille net and her horse-hair roller that she rolls her hair on, just where she left them last night t No, sir, wherever she is, she is in her white dressing-gown, which is also missing." "It cannot be as you say!" exclaimed the agonized hus, band. "Look  search t Had she no other clothes that she might have put on?" "'Lord, no, sir; not here as yet; not another single bonnet, shawl, or dress I and look there, sir, beside the bed I there are her shoes and stockings, just as she drew them off last night I but I don't see her slippers any where. It must be as I said, sir I wherever she is, she must be in her flannel dressing-gown, and so she cannot be far off." Dr. Heath did not stay to hear the last words. He rushed frantically out into the back yard, in the desperate hope that he might have overlooked Alice in, his first search. Then hurrying back, he seized his hat and rushed out at the front door to search the narrow, wooded vale. Up and down through the thicket he hurried, calling wildly upon the name of Alice, and bitterly reproaching himself that he had left her for an hour. But no trace of the lost one could le found in the lonely glen. After two hours spent in that distracted search, he went - back to the cottage in the vain hope that she might have returned. He found Mrs. Martin presiding over the break. fast that she had kept warm for him. "Hve you found her, Master Francis?" "Found her I no-  Has she not returned?"  &#xD;<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7861-00000193"/> 404    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. "Alack I no, sir!" He threw himself into a chair, and groaned aloud. IJn truth this case of disappearance was one of unexampled difficulty and distress. In any ordinary case he could have called upon his friends and neighbors to assist him in his search, and he could have advertised in the public papers. But in this case, where the lost one was a fugitive in hiding for her life and liberty, he dared not call on any one to assist him in the quest, for if any other than himself should find her, she would then be worse than lost, worse than dead I As these thoughts revolved through his mind, groan after groan burst from his bosom. Master Francis I Master Francis I for heaven's sake don't do that I Come and have a morsel of something to keep up your strength," pleaded his housekeeper. "What! and she abducted I arrested I or wandering somewhere in deadly peril!" And with the impulse of wild regret and longing that drives the bereaved intothe last haunts of the lost, Francis Heath started up and went into his wife's deserted chamber.   CHAPTER XLIII. Oft expectation fails, and most oft there j Where most it promises; but oft it hits Where hope is coldest and despair most sits.--haWB er. Yet now despair itself is mild, Even as the winds and waters are; I would lie down like-a tired child, And weep away the life of care Which I have borne and yet must bear, Till death, like sleep, might steal on me And I might feel in the warm air, My cheek grow cold, and hear the sea Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony.-Shelley. WHEEN Francis Heath, in great trouble, passed into the apartment of his lost wife, he drew aside the curtains to throw himself upon the bed and give way to his passion of grief. Bnt the sight that met him there was such as might have called back his spirit had it been hovering on the confines of eternity. For there lay Alice, sleeping as calmly, breathing as reg- ularly, as though she had lain undisturbed since the night before. Indeed, it was difficult to look upon her calmly reposing form and face, and believe that she had left her bed at all. For a minute he stood, arrested by the unex- pected and incomprehensible fact, in a sort of stupefaction of astonishment. But the spell was presently broken by the ecstatic joy he felt at her restoration, and, without walking her, he hurried into the kitchen, saying- "Martin, she is found. Come here." The housekeeper hastened at once to obey, and, full of wonder, followed him to the bedside, where he pointed to the sleeping form of Alice.

"I know no more about how she came back than you do, Martin. I came in hither to throw myself upon the bed for a few minutes, and when I drew aside the curtains, she was lying here as you see her, fast asleep. We must wait until she wakes for an explanation of this riddle," said Dr. Heath, in answer to the wild, inquiring looks of his housekeeper. "The Lord save us!" again ejaculated the housekeeper, who seemed incapable of varying the expression of her astonishment. " But it is very strange that you know nothing about it, ,as I see by your face that you do not. It is inexplicable that you neither saw nor heard her return." " eaven bless us I it is like fairy-work," said the woman. "I shall sit by the bed-side until she wakes, and you may bring me a cup of coffee here, Martin," said the doctor. And the old servant hastened to obey the wishes of her master. Dr. Heath watched long and patiently by the bedside ,of his wife, who continued to sleep serenely until late in the afternoon, when she quietly opened her eyes, and seeing her husband, said-- ' You here, Francis? Why, when did you arrive?" "Early this morning, dear; and it is now nearly four in the afternoon." She looked at him in astonishment, saying- "Is it possible that I have so overslept myself Why did you not awaken me?" "Because no invalid should ever be awakened, dear; besides, you were disturbed in the night, or at least, you were up very early this morning, -and out, which was very imprudent, and very extraordinary, after your promise to   THE  GIPSY'S   PROPPECY.     407 me that you would not leave the house during my absence," said Dr. Heath, in a voice of gentle reproof. She looked at him in utter amazement, repeating- "I disturbed in the night I up and out early this morning? Why, I have not even stirred since I lay down here last night. I was so fatigued,I slept so soundly that I did not even dream l" "Alice, what is that you tell me? When I came home this morning your bed was empty, and you were not to be found any where," said Francis Heath, in perplexity "Impossible I You could not have looked. Since I retired last night I have not moved. I do not believe I have even turned over. I certainly have not waked up until now. Ah, I see you do not believe me. Ask Martin, then; she knows that I have never stirred," said Alice, with a look of distress. "On the contrary, my dear Alice, Martin knows that when she arose this morning you were not in your bed, nor in your room, nor in the house, nor on the premises, and that the back door, which she had carefully fastened last night, was open. Now, what am I to think of that?" in- quired her husband, in a vexation of spirit that might have been deep displeasure had not the misfortunes of Alice made him exceedingly tender towards her. On, my soul, as I hope for salvation, I have never once waked up until now; and as for getting up and leaving the'house, oh, Francis, do you think I would so disobey you? Or do you think that I would tell you an untruth?" said poor Alice, with her eyes full of tears. "No, Alice, I do not. I must believe you think as you speak; and yet it is as true as heaven that you have been absent from the house several hours, no one knows where. You went unnoticed and you returned unobserved. - Martin knows this as well as myself." "And you cannot believe me, then, when I assure you ,   &#xD;<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7861-00000195"/> 408    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHEsCY. that I have slept continuously through the night; and up to the moment that I opened my eyes and beheld you sit- ting beside me?" said Alice, bursting into tears. "Yes, yes, my love, I do believe you. I cannot look into your truthful eyes and refuse to trust you, even against the' evidence of my own senses and those of Martin. There, do not weep, love. It is some mistake for which you are not to blame, and which time can only explain. For the rest, I cannot be too much rejoiced only to have you restored to me," said Francis Heath, kissing her tenderly, before he went into the kitchen to speak to the housekeeper. "Martin," he said, " she is awake.' "Lord love her heart! And what does she say about her morning walk?" inquired the old woman with interest. "She denies ever having left her bed, or even waked up until this hour; and she evidently firmly believes what she says." "The Lord have a care of us!" exclaimed Martin. "It is a mystery that only time and watchfulness can solve. Meanwhile, you must not speak to her upon the agitating subject, unless she first mentions it, and then treat it as lightly as you can. Henceforth, I myself shall remain with her every night, and during the day you must never lose sight of her. Thus our redoubled care must at once keep her in safety and solve the mystery." "If she gets away from me again she must be cunninger than I take her for," said Martin to herself. "And now," continued the doctor, "I wish you to pre- pare some refreshment, and take it in to your mistress. She must not rise to-day, for though she has slept so long, she is evidently much exhausted." And leaving these directions with his housekeeper, Francis Heath returned to the chamber of his wife, whom he- did not leave again that night. he     n   11   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        409  ; Alice slept well, and awoke refreshed. Immediately after a very early breakfast, Dr. Heath mounted his horse, and returned by a circuitous and unfre- quented way to the town of Gwyn. During his absence, all through the day, Mrs. Martin took care not to lose sight of her mistress. At nightfall the doctor returned, and was rejoiced to find his wife well and cleerful; and after an early supper, as he was very much fatigued, they retired. Having lost his rest for several preceding nights, the doctor-only waited till he saw Alice in a healthful slumber, and then gave himself up to repose. He was soon buried in a profound and dreamless sleep, such a sleep as a strong man enjoys, after many days and nights of watching, and of harassing fatigue and anxiety. He slept like the dead until near morning, when an ill dream, a heavy sense of impending danger, and a strange, nervous shock, aroused him. He started up in bed, but so deep had been his sleep, so strange his forgotten dream, and so severe the unknown shock which aroused him, that he could not at once recol- lect where -he was. The old clock in the passage was striking three. Sud- denly he remembered time, place, and circumstances; and at the same moment he missed Alice from his side I To spring out of bed, strike a light, and search the room, was but the work of a minute. But Alice was nowhere to be seen. He flew to the back door leading into thei yard. The door was unfastened and slightly ajar. He hurried into the small, circumscribed yard, and eagerly searched, but no trace of Alice could be found. Neither was there any egress from this yard by which she might have passed out.- Half-distracted with anxiety, he rushed back into the house, and into the kitchen, where Martin had made up her bed, and called--  &#xD;<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC7861-00000196"/> "O    THE  GIPrSYtS PROPHECY.

Your mistress is gone l" "Gone againl The Lord have a care of us   We're bewitched l" exclaimed the old woman, jumping up, hurry- ing on her clothes, and coming forth. The most anxious search commenced throughout the house, but without success. "She escaped through the back door of this chamber, and into that yard; and there she seems t3 have vanished like a spirit, for there is no egress for her bodily form!" said the doctor, in amazement and distress, pointing to the little yard, enclosed as it was with high walls on three sides, and- the inaccessible precipice on the fourth. "I can't say any thing about it, sir; I feel as if I was going crazy l" said the housekeeper, desperately. "Martin, I wish you to remain in this room and watch that back door, while I search for her through the valley," said the doctor, placing a candle in a glass lantern, and leaving the cottage for the purpose. Martin remained in the mysterious chamber, shivering with cold and fear, and muttering- "I wish he had not left me here by myself. She's 'no canny,' as the Scotch say. - She's been dead once, and well nigh buried, as I begin to think she ought to have been, for she can't be like other flesh and blood, a-vanishing: in this way. She may be her own ghost for aught I know I I'm fear'd of her, with her appearings and disappearings. Oh, Lord save and protect me!" she cried, shaking with terror, as Alice, like a spirit indeed, with her pale face, streaming black hair, and flowing white garments, glided across the room and vanished within'the curtains. The terror-stricken woman had no power to approacn the bed or look upon her unearthly mistress. She remained cowering in her seat, and mutt,ering prayers to herself,   -THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECy.      4" untiltshe heard the welcome sound of her master's footsteps approaching. This circumstance gave her so much cour- age, that when Dr. Heath entered the chamber inquiring, in a hopeless tone of voice- "Has Alice returned?"y She was enabled to point to the bed and answer- "Yes, sir." "When and how?" inquired the doctor, approaching the bed -and looking upon the face of his wife, who was quietly sleeping. "As I am a living sinner, she suddenly appeared in the centre of the room, and seemed to float towards the bed, where she disappeared without saying a word," replied the housekeeper, whose greatly-excited imagination uncon- sciously exaggerated the truth. "Do you mean to say that she did not come in through that back door?" "Not as I saw, sir. She suddenly appeared like a ghost in the middle of the room, and floated towards the becd, and vanished within the curtains, as I tell you I H Oh, hmy dear, good young master, are you sure you didn't commit a great sin in taking her o-ut of her coffin and bringing her back to life?

Dr. Heath sat down beside the bed, and while watching the slumbers of his wife, fell into profound thought. There was but one rational solution to all this mystery, and that solution filled him with the greatest anxiety. How to meet the dangers that it inevitably involved he could not yet discover. While he sat revolving these perplexing thoughts in his mind, Alice awoke naturally and spoke-  "Up so early, dear Francis?" "Yes, Alice; you know that I must visit my patients early this morning; but I will return the sooner to-night, said the doctor, avoiding all allusion to her second disap- pearance, of which she was evidently unconscious. "Then I will get up and breakfast with you first, for I feel quite well this morning," said Alice, cheerfully. Dr. Heath assented, and went into the kitchen to caution Martin against mentioning the strange event of the night to her mistress. After breakfast he departed, consigning Alice to the strictest vigilance of her aged attendant. This day passed as the preceding one. The manner of Alice was so natural; she ate and drank, read and sewed so much like other women of flesh and blood, that the su- perstitious terrors of the aged housekeeper were gradualy Earlier than usual in the evening Dr. Heath returned, bringing, in a  portmanteau, a few changes of raiment to his wife, and in his pocket a humorous book, with which he designed to amuse her that evening by reading aloud. When they retired to their chamber, he took care, after bolting and locking the doors, to withdraw the keys and place them under his pillow, so that Alice couid not again escape from the room. And he further resolved to lie awake and watch Alice during the night. This was not difficult, as curiosity and anxiety left him little inclination s   THE  GIPSYiS PROPHECY.        413 to slumber. Feigning sleep, therefore, he lay still and vigilant. Alice was soon fast asleep; he heard her breath- ing slowly and regularly while he lay and watched. Inter- minably long seemed every hour.  He heard the clock strike ten, and then eleven. Longer than this, however, his patience was not doomed to be tried. As the last stroke of eleven died away, he felt Alice move cautiously, and saw her rise slowly in a sitting posture, murmuring- "He must confess I he must confess! It is of no con- sequence that poor Alice Owen should suffer dishonor; but the wife of Francis Heath must not, shall- not rest under it I He must confess I H will compel him to do so 1" And throwing the cover off, she slowly arose and stood up. Knowing the danger of awakening a sleep-walker, as he now knew her to be, Dr. Heath softly arose and followed her. Noiselessly she glided round to the other side of the bed, slipped her hand under the pillow, withdrew the keys that he had placed there, selected one, and glided towards the back door, unlocked it and passed out, Dr. Heath keep- ing close behind her with the shaded lamp that he had seized on passing the mantelpiece; but when he crossed the threshold of the door Alice had vanished I Doubting the evidence of his own senses, the doctor went carefully around the little yard, scrutinizing every part of it. This was soon done. There was nothing but twelve feet of bare ground, enclosed by three high stone walls and an inacces- sible precipice. There was not an article there that could have hidden a child, still less concealed a full-grown wo- man; and not a; gate or even a gap through which slie could have escaped. : "This is most inexplicable. This is something more than somnambulency, or else I am going mad I Has the earth swallowed her?" muttered Dr. Heath to, himself, as he gazed around the empty yard. "'Here she vanished, and here she must appear again;  &#xD;<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC7861-00000198"/> "4    THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY,. therefore, here I will watch until she comes, he con. cluded. He returned within the room for a moment, to assure himself that the other door and the window werefast, and then drew on his boots, wrapped himself in his cloak, and took his station, like a sentinel, at the back door, keeping his eyes fixed upon the yard. The walls were too high for any woman to scale, yet, as that seemed the only possible means of egress, he kept his attention closely fixed upon them. No faithful sentinel ever had a more weary or anxious watch. He remained there until the clock struck twelve; shifted his position, and leaned against the right post of the door-frame, until the clock struck one; changed his attitude, and rested against the left post until it struck two; then drew himself up, yawned, stretched his limbs, and renewed his attention to the walls of the yard, when suddenly, as though she had dropped from the sky, or risen from the earth, Alice, white-robed, pale, with her dark hair flowing, and her dark eyes fixed and wide open, appeared before him. As he started back from the apparition she glided past him, crossed the room, and disappeared as before within the curtains of the bed. The whole thing had an aspect so unearthly, so super- natural, so ghostly, that Dr. Heath no longer wondered at the , excessive terror exhibited by the housekeeper in wit- nessing the same phenomenon. As soon as he had recov- ered from his panic of astonishment, he closed the door, and once more retired to rest. But there was no more sleep for Francis Heath that night. The first part of the mystery only was solved. It was what he had already suspected. Alice was a somnambulist. But the last and greatest part of the mystery remained   THE GIPSY7S PR OPI     ECY.    415 unexplained. In what manner had she vanished from that circumscribed and strongly-enclosed yard? Where had she passed the interval of her absence, and how had she, re-entered without his knowledge? These were questions that chased slumber from the eyes of Francis Heath. He resolved to watch with even greater vigilance the next night, and if Alice again walked in her sleep, to follow her so closely that she should not elude him, and by this means he felt sure of discovering her mode of egress, and tracing her to her midnight resort. These thoughts occu- pied him through the remainder of the night. In the-morning Alice awoke naturally and arose cheer- fully to join him at breakfast. As upon the day before, he departed early, with the promise to return in the even- ing. But all through that day the thought of Alice dis- turbed his peace. He longed for the approach of night, when, by redoubled vigilance he might solve her mystery. Never were the shades of evening more welcome than upon that afternoon when he turned his horse's head home, ward. Upon reaching the cottage he found the kitchen cheer- fully lighted up by the wood fire and the two sperm candles, the tea-table set, and Alice seated beside it, reading aloud to Martin, who sat knitting in the chimney. No two people could present agreater contrast to each other than -Alice in her usual daily avocations and Alice in her nightly wanderings. Dr. Heath was forcibly struck by this con-. trast, and hoped, with the coming night, to solve the mystery, and pat an end forever to her ramblings. o  &#xD;<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC7861-00000199"/> CHAPTER XLIV.

Who speaks through the dark night And lull of the wind?- 'Tis the sound of the pine-leaves I' the forest behind. On, on, through the darkness A spectre r pass, Where like moaning of breaking hearts Surges the grass. AT length came the welcome hour of repose. After carefully securing the doors and windows, the little family retired to rest. Francis Heath lay down, not to sleep but to watch.  Alice was soon sunk in a healthful slumber. The house was very still.  No sound from within or with- out broke the deep silence.  Long and weary seemed the time to the solitary watcher.  The almost irresistible in- clination to sleep crept over him.  He was yielding to its power, when the striking of the clock aroused him. As the last stroke of eleven sounded in the ear, Alice, as upon the preceding night, slowly arose in a sitting posture, put up her hands to her face, pushed back her long hair that rolled down a black cataract upon her shoulders, glared into-'acancy with wide-open, but unseeing black eyes, and muttering, "He must confess I he- must confess I or nightly shall his rest be broken by the trumpet-tones of remorse; daily shall his flesh wither from his bones; his heart shrivel in his bosom, until his frame, consumed by the fires of guilt, shall sink in ashes to the grave, and his spirit be dW    THB  aGPS'8Y  7 p RtOPHECT.     4 sped to those eternal flames that shall never be quenched 1' And throwing off the cover, she arose and stood up, then passed around the foot of the bed to the opposite side, slipped her hand under the pillow, possessed herself as before of the keys, and glided towards the back door . Swiftly and silently Dr. Heath arose, thrust his feet into slippers, threw on his dressing-gown, and. prepared to follow her closely. i Remembering with what supernatural swiftness shehad vanished from his sight on the preceding night, he resolved to be .on his guard. He snatched the shaded light from the mantel-piece and held it in one hand, while with the other he seized her garment just as, having unfastened the door, she was gliding through it. Keeping so close to her that she should not feel his grasp upon her white gown, he followed her straight across the yard towards the precipice at the back. There, pushing aside the crowded evergreens that closed up the chasm in-the rock, she entered what seemed at first a hidden ravine. Pushing her way slowly on, and turning now a little toothe, right and now a little to the left, as the tortuous subter- ranean pass wound, sheo went on and on, until the first sur- prise and curiosity of Dr. Heath was merged in astonish- ment and alarm. This ravine or cavern was much longer and deeper than he had ever suspected it to be. Indeed, choked up as the mouth of the cavern was with evergreens, he had scarcely noticed it at all, or thought of it, except as the little cleft in the rock in which the blood-stained gar- ments of the unhappy miser had been found. Hedid not know, he had never heard that it had any depth at all; and new it seemed, in its rugged, dark, and tortuous course, to be of interminable depth or rather length. Whither did it lead? Had it any outlet? Alice went slowly on and on, gliding up and down, right and left, as the irregularities of the narrow passage de- manded. The secret of her disappearance was now re-  &#xD;<pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC7861-00000200"/> '418.   THE  GIPSY S PROPHECY veailed; she had always in4-eaving the yard vanished into this; secret subterranean passage; but whither was she bound, and:for what purpose? Still she went on and on, now rising, now sinking; nod passing to one side, now to another; and now stooping as the projecting or overhanging rocks compelled her. The anxiety of Dr. Heath was almost insupportable. lNothing but the extreme danger of awakening the sleep-walker there and then prevented him from stopping her. In following her closely, and keeping hold of her garment- whenever the sudden turnings of the pass permitted, he chose the less of two evils. Added to this consideration was a strong curiosity and interest in knowing whither this fearful night-walk through the interior of the mountain tended, and what could be the motive of the walker. So, keeping as close as possible to Alice, and guarding his lamp carefully, Dr. Heath followed her, as she slowly wound up and down, right and left--now climbing, now stooping, through this terrible subterranean passage. At length, after nearly an hour of this toilsome progress, the scene suddenly expanded. They had not, however, come out into the open air; that Dr. Heath knew as well from the warmth and closeness of the atmosphere as from the absence of any view of the sky. He' turned his lantern around, and idiscovered, to his great astonishment, that they were within the foundation vaults -or cellars of, some large house. Stone walls and shadowy arches were all around them. He had no time for wonder or speculation, for Alice, like a spirit, glided on before him. He  followed her through several arched compartments of the cellar to the foot of a flight of steep stairs that she began to ascend. He went after her up these stairs to their landing in a narrow passage, in which hung several dark   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY.      419 cloaks, indicating that the house was inhabited, though the family seemed at this hour buried in deep repose. The feelings of Dr. Heath on finding himself here were complicated- and painful. He had secretly entered a strange house in the dead of the night like any burglar. What if some member of the !family, awakening, should discover him and shoot him as a housebreaker'before he should have time to make himself known or to explain his presence? And even if no .one was awakened, and he went on in safety, whither did this walk tend? What would be the end of this strange adven- ture. He had no time for farther reflections, for Alice had approached the back staircase of the mansionleading from this to the upper chambers. Hel followed her as, like'a spirit, slowly and silently she glided up these stairs, to o second landing in a back passage. Stil gliding on before him, she wound through several intricate turnings, until, at the end of a short, narrow pas- sage, she reached the door of a chamber, where, for the first time, she paused as if spellbound. Dr. Heath was at her side, waiting in the extremity of anxiety. Just then the clock began to strike the hour of midnight. As the last stroke of twelve died away, Alice slowly pushed open the door, revealing a lighted chamber, in which were two persons, wlhose pale faces and fixed eyes seemed to speak of a panic of astonishment. ,          .   ."'/ -             te z *-  &#xD;<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC7861-00000201"/> CHAPTER XLV.

To elucidate the event mentioned at the close of our last chapter, it is necessary to go back in our history for the space of a few days. In the world outside the narrow valley of Horne's Hole the fate of Alice Heath had been forgotten, save by the few devoted friends who had been faithful to her in her days of bitter distress and by the conscience-stricken man who had prosecuted her to destruction; and other exciting events soon drove the memory of the lost girl, for a time, even from their minds. First, Mr. Maraudey was, by a writ of habeas corpus, brought into court, to have the reason of his detention in prison re-investigated. 'His friends came forward in force, both with money and counsel. His case was argued pro anrid con. for more than a week, and created quite as great an excitement in its own way as had the two remarkable criminal trials immediately preceding it. But on the ninth day, the judgment of the court was pro- nounced, discharging him from custody. Dissenters and churchmen almost equally rejoiced in the liberation of the portly and popular priest. Colonel North and other gentlemen of the county gave (420)   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        421 dinners in his honor. Old maids and widows made tea. parties for his delectation. Why--even the poor farm- servants gave country-dances in the barn, and got" glorious" for the glory of "Father O'Lordy."  Dr. Horne, alone, of all the inhabitants of the neighbor- hood, paid no sort of attention to the lion of the day. And, in fact, every person admitted that, both upon ac- count of his wife's recent death and his own serious indis- position, Dr. Horne might well be excused from either giving entertainments or even participating in those given by others. The same pretext seemed to enfranchise the doctor from all other liabilities; for when, a few days after the mock funeral, Francis Heath called at Radnor, for perhaps the tenth time, to demand satisfaction of its master for the persecution of that poor, martyred girl, he was told that the doctor was confined to his bed by illness, and could not be -seen. Again and again, upon his repeating the visit, was the same answer returned, until Francis Heath: for the present gave up the pursuit, and quietly but firmly "bided his time." Dr. Horne was new, seldom seen in public, and never where there was a possibility of encountering his late student.  Meanwhile, how went the time with Gerald Mostyn and his devoted wife? and what effect had the liberation of Mr. Maraudey upon his condition and prospects? Mr, Mostyn, still a close prisoner, under sentence of death, suffered extremely both in health and spirits, not only from confinement, but also from intolerable suspense. Constance-noble Constance i fondly soothed or faithfully  shared his sorrows. Day after day they had lived in the hope that the real criminal, conscience-stricken, would have been compelled to come forward and confess the crime for which he unjustly sufiered  2e  &#xD;<pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC7861-00000202"/> "2   dTHE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY. But as: the heavy days, in their dull monotony, moved slowly past, the sickening nature of this " hope deferred" began to tell tremendously upon the mind and body both of Constance and Gerald. A flash of hope sprang up with the liberation of Mr. Maraudey, and the question of how far and how favorably his enlargement might affect the fate of the condemned. That question was soon and bitterly answered.  The community, upon the first startling intelligence of the mysterious stranger who, under the seal of confession, had charged himself with the murder of Hugh Home, at once asserted the innocence of Gerald Mostyn, and clamored for  his unconditional reprieve. But as time went by, and no light was shed upon the dark event, people began to wonder and speculate, and finally returned to their first faith in the- guilt of the condemned. Some expressed their belief that the stranger of the con- fessional was only a sham penitent, who had been hired by the friends of Mr. Mostyn to tell that tale, in the faint hope of saving his life. Others did not hesitate to assert that the story of the penitent was itself a deception, invented by the pitiful but not too punctilious. priest, for the preservation of the prisoner's life. A  few stern-hearted men thought the course of the Minister in this matter weak, and hoped that ther' would be- no further delay in- carrying into effect the sentence of the law.  Meanwhile, not only close confinement, not only wearing suspense and painful misconstruction, but severe privation, was the lot of Gerald and Constance. One by one their little, articles of jewelry had been sacrificed-first to pay the c-ost of the defence in the trial, next to remunerate the warden for a  few extra comforts supplied by him; and now that the. last crown had been expended, Constance- te- deemed her pledge and worked for him.       :   THE -GIPS:Y-S- PEROPHEC,..       42' He did not know it I When, through all the hours of the weary day, he saw her nimble fingers fly over some piece of delicate needlework, he would ask-- "What; is it, love, that you are so busy about?" "Why, a lady's collar-do you not see?" she would reply. And he, never doubting that she was working it for her- self, would investigate no further. And, sometimes when-some' little comfort, not down in the prison bill of fare, would grace his morning or his even- ing meal, and he would, look up inquiringly into her face, she- would smile and answer- "Yes, I got it; the money obtained from the sale of your watch iss not all gone yet." (This was: true. Constance, the- diplomate, had saved one shilling of that money, which she kept purposely, in order to: be able to make just such replies to just such looks.) In simple poverty, however severe, these two could have been happy;- but- this v. as poverty in a prison. To any prospect of toil and privation they would have looked for- ward cheerfully; but for them in life, loomedt but one object, of blackest horror-the scaffold-whose dark, image overshadowed them; deeper and deeper grew the gloom as, time bore them onwards towards its midnight of shame and death. The day of execution approached-. It was: known that the Minister would grant no second respite, and that the condemned must prepare to meet his fate; for that, with- out providential; interposition, upon the twenty-eighth of the month his senteace would be carried into effect.- Despair overshadowed the soul of the prisoner; his wife sought earnestly to dispel its- gloom. As a general rule,: I think, we women are less subject to despondency, more gifted with hope, than men; perhaps it: is because we have m3re elasticity, if less strength than our brothers.  &#xD;<pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC7861-00000203"/> 424    THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY. Upon"the Sabbath, when she came as usual to see him, after they had read together the morning service according to the Episcopal ritual, and had laid aside their books, he took her hand as she sat beside him on the bed, and said-. "Dear Constance, this is the last Sabbath save one, that we, shall be together'---t "Not so. Oh, not so, not by many years of Sabbaths!"1 she answered, hope still struggling against the terrors that would have overmastered her. "My own heroic wife, look fate steadily in the face. You have firmness enough to do so. I wish to say to you that Mr. Osborne has kindly offered to my widow a home at the parsonage until such time as she shall have attained her majority, entered upon her estates, and is at liberty to choose her dwelling in the world." "I your widow I oh, never, never I All the mercy that there is in heaven forbid itf!" she answered, shuddering. "I could not survive you-no, not for a day, should you perish so--and yet I look to live many, many years!" "Constance, why will you not see the truth? The fatal day is very near!" "I know it. But the 'fatal' day will never come I Be- lieve it, Gerald. For, between this day and that, one of two things will happen.  Either the real criminal, whom we already know to be conscience-stricken, will be con- strained to appear, or, failing that, the Minister will feel morally obliged to interpose, and save:a man whose guilt even he must now doubt. Believe it, Gerald, for, on my soul, I believe ith  "Aye, Constance, you 'believe and-tremble,'" replied Mr. Mostyn, who calmly endeavored to lay aside hope for life,.and prepare himself for death. While these events were transpiring in the prison, a strange, dark, wild rumor was beginning to prevail outside.   THE -GIPSY'S PROPHECY.         425 It concerned Dr. Horne. In one respect this man had not "shammed." He was indubitably ill both in mind and body. From the time of the funeral of Alice Heath his health and spirits had utterly failed. He neglected his profession, lost much of his practice, confined himself closely to his house, and seemedfast falling into a state of confirmed hypochondria. Various were the causes assigned by the community for his deplorable con- dition. Some ascribed it to extreme grief -for the loss of his wife--others did not scruple to attribute it to remorse for the, fatal prosecution of poor Alice Heath. As time passed the health and spirits of the morose hypochondriac grew worse and worse. His profession was utterly neg- lected; his practice entirely lost. His time was passed in wandering through the solitary woods and among the gloomy mountain-gorges around his dreary dwelling, or else brooding in his chamber. And from that lone mansion strange rumors reached the surrounding neighborhood. Old family domestics whis- pered of fearful sights and sounds seen and heard about that house. Some bolder than the rest hinted that the spirit of Alice Heath haunted the dwelling of her destroyer. Others went further still, and said that if any one should listen at his chamber-door, their morose master might be heard in the middle of the night pleading with the spirit of the martyred girl. For some time these rumors were regarded as the ro- manches of the servants. But at length more serious atten- tion was, given :to the subjef, when, one day, as Mr. Osborne was ridingto Horne's Hole, to make a call 'upon old Mr. Hayhurst, the overseer, he was met in the depths of the forest by Dr. Horne, who was walking along -and gazing wildly around.

"Parson, do you believe the dead can walk?" The pastor paused in astonishment for a moment, and then answered, somewhat sternly- "No; at least I neverfsaw them doing so, though fools, frightened at their own shadows, and villains pursued by remorse, fancy that they do.' Why do you ask me?" ques- tioned Mr. Osborne, in astonishment. "Beceuse she does." "Who?" again inquired the clergyman, in consternation. "S  th--the dead woman!" "Your wife do you mean?" asked Mr. Osborne, in a sort of horror. "Hush t no, the other one tP ' Alice?" "Hush, I say H-yes-she comes every night. Do you believe it? "I believe that you are very ill, and require medical treatment," replied the deeply-shocked pastor, gazing with pain upon the cadaverous complexion and fierce eyes of the -other speaker. "'III?'-hum; 'ill' has two meanings-ill, sick, and ill, sinful. Now, do you mean to say that I am very sick, or very sinful?"' asked the doctor, with a sardonic smile. "Both, perhaps ; and in either case you need a physician -of the soul or of the body-perhaps of botli, as I said"' replied the clergyman, gravely. 'A physician - where shall I get one? Heath and myself are the only physicians in this neighborhood. This physician," he said, clapfing his hand upon his breast, -"this physician cannot heal himself. And as for H:eath, he had rather killthan cure-me  ' III,'indeed 'physician,' forsooth. Good day, physician of the soul 1" And so saying,-the lunaltic-for lunatic Mr. Osborne had now no doubt that he was-turned, and disappeared in the woods.

On arriving, he was at once shown-into the sitting-room, where he found the ,old man alone, and suffering from rheumatism. "I am sorry to find you ,so unwell, Mr. Hayhurst," said the pastor, after the first salutation had passed, and he had taken his seat. "Yes, sir, and I am sorry-to be so. It is not, however, because I am sick that I sent for you, Mr. Osborne; but to consult you about the case of my employer." "Dr. Horne?" "Of course, sir; I think it is time he was looked to. "What ails him?" "It is more than I can. tell, sir; but I doubt that he is losing his mind. You might have met him as you rode along, for he has just left here." "I did meet him." "And did he tell you   " said Hayhurst, suddenly pausing, and looking intently into the eyes of his visitor. "He told me of sone hallucinations that trouble his rest," replied the clergyman, gravely. "And what do you make of them, sir?" inquired the farmer, anxicusly. "That he is partially deranged," answered Mr. Os- borne. , Well, sir, I fear you are right; it is a satisfaction to have my own opinion confirmed. He has been here several times, proposing to me to go home with him, and watch with him in his chamber through the night, What would you advise me, under the circumstances, to do?" ,Asstdredly,' Mr. Hayhurst, I should earnestly counsel you to do as he requests. Nay, I think it your imperative duty to do so." \ ..^  &#xD;<pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC7861-00000205"/> "I am willing to follow your instructions, sir; though I cannot now see what I can do." "Why, this--by watching with him through the hours during which he fancies he sees the apparition, you can better observe the character and symptoms of the fit of frenzy that must then come upon him, and you will be pre- pared to give some report of his case before the proper authorities." "And for what purpose, sir? I don't understand." "Why, for this purpose, certainly. If he is insane, then for his own safety and well-being, as much as for that of all around him, he should be placed under restraint and medi- cal treatment. To have this effected, it is necessary that his condition should be proved by a competent witness. Now, the farm-servants by whom he is surrounded, are not capable of understanding his case-hence the necessity of some competent person passing time enough with him to be able to testify to his state. Do you comprehend?" "Yes, sir; but it seems treacherous to go to his house for any such secret purpose 1" said the farmer, with a -dubious expression of countenance. "Treacherous? Why should it be   Not at all  Would you have the poor, solitary sufferer grow worse for want of proper medical attendance? Or, supposing him insane, would you haave him left at large to do himself or some other person a fatal injury?" inquired Mr., Os- borne, with surprise. "Oh, no, sir, by no means; and looking at it in your light, it may possibly be right that I should go and do as you advise me," replied the'farmer, who after some further and unimportant debate and hesitation, yielded to the force of the clergyman's arguments, and promised to follow his directions.

IT was two days after this occurrence, one dark and dismal evening, when the rain came. on in fitful gusts, the wind wailed in rising and falling sobs, the lightning lashed at long intervals, and the thunder muttered sullenly-an evening having all the gloom without the- glory of storm-- that the pastor sat alone in his study engaged in writing his sermon for the next Sabbath morning, when there came a low rap at the door, "Come in," said Mr. Osborne, without lifting his eyes from his work. The door opened and some one entered. And Mr. Osborne looked up to behold, with surprise, Mr. Hayhurst, the steward, who stood before him with an aspect so pale, frightened, and woebegone, that the worthy clergyman threw down the pen, started up and seized his hand, and gazing on him, exclaimed-- "Why, Hayhurst, my friend, what is the matter?' "I do not know, sir, unless it is that I am going mad as fast as Dr. Horne." , Why-what mean you, then?" "I watched wig him last night." Yt ou did? And the result? Tell me all about it.

He laid down in his clothes on the outside of the bed. I sat in an easy-chair beside him.

I heard the clock strike ten; then, after a long, dull, tedious interval, eleven; then, perhaps, I dozed, for I did not hear it strike twelve, although it was just at that hour that I was, horribly startled by hearing a long, low, wailing cry from the mouth of the man on the bed. "Looking up, I saw Dr. Horne sitting on the bed, his face pale as death, his brow bathed in perspiration, his eyes strained out upon some object, to which his long arm and skeleton finger pointed. "Following instantly the direction of his gaze and his finger, to my horror and amazement, I saw, as plainly as I see you now-.will you believe me? shall I tell you?-the apparition of Alice Heath standing within the doorway. The image was clothed, not in the habiliments of the grave, but inthe usual white dress worn in life; her pale face was cadaverous as that of an exhumed corpse; her wild, black locks straggled in disorder down upon her breast; her eyes were wide open, steady, frozen; her hand was raised to Heaven with an adjuring gesture. "But my horror and amazement never reached its height, until those stony eyes fixed themselves upon the face of Dr. Horne, and, with her hand still raised to Heaven, her frozen lips parted with the one thrilling word- "' CONFESS IX   THE GIPSY'S   PROPHECY.      481 "At that word Dr. Horne sank back into a swoon, and the vision vanished." Here Hayhurst paused, while Mr. Osborne gazed-at him in silent astonishment, not unmixed with suspicion and indignation, as a man might gaze upon a person who should dare to put his credulity to thejseverest test. Then speak- ing slowly, and keeping his eyes fixed upon the face of his visitor, he said- "You saw the apparition of Alice   Heath s tanding within the door of Dr. Horne's chamber last night at twelve o'clock?" "By all my hopes of heaven, I did!" returned the other, without withdrawing his gaze. "Man--man--you fell asleep and dreamed the whole thing." "Then Dr. Horne and myself dreamt the same dream at precisely the same hour 1" "You, are mad I1 "That may well be. But if I am sane, as sure as I stand here before you, as sure as I speak in your presence, and am heard in heaven, I saw the form that I have de- scribed to you, last night at twelve o'clock, in the doorway of Dr. Horne's chamber," replied the visitor, with deep solemnity. "And, after the swoon of Dr. Home and the disappear- ance of the vision, what happened?" ' "Why as soon as I recovered the use of my limbs, and collected my scattered faculties, I went to the bedside, and sought to restore my friend to consciousness, not only for his own sake, but for mine, for it was -terrible to be alone under such circumstances. But his swoon proved to be an obstinate one, and so, after working over him for some time in vain, I roused up the house servants."

HorThe vision of lice and the deathly swoon of Dr. torne; and when, by our united efforts, we called the doctor to his senses, with great mental distress he confirmed his serVant's words."- Mr. Osborne shook his head slowly, and with an air of incredulity. "You do not believe it!" exclaimed his visitor, with a look of pain. "My friend," said Mr. Osborne, solemnly, "I have no doubt that you believe all that you tell me. I am con- vinced that you act and speak in perfect good faith; but, in a case where I should distrust the fidelity of my. own senses, you must forgive me if I cannot credit those of others. , "Well, Mr. Osborne," said the farmer, with an humbled look, "I did not, Heaven knows, come out this stormy evening only to astonish you with a marvellous and incred. ible story.

Certainly there is no need that I should assure, you of my perfect faith in your truthfulness.

Such a prodigy, could such really, possibly exist, should be witnessed, not by one man, or even by two, but by many at one and the same time that each might have the witness of others, and that all might feel sure that no deception had been practised.

I do not like the man, still it is our bounden duty, both for his sake and for the well-being of others, to do what we can to ascertain his real condition, with a view to his relief." "That was my only motive, sir, for troubling you at all." "Well, Mr. Hayhurst, for the present do not mention this to any one. I will speak confidentially to Colonel North, who is a magistrate, and we will consult as to the best course to be pursued," said the clergyman, with some- thing of the air of dismissing his visitor. The farmer so understood his manner, and arose to depart, saying- "Well, sir, I will leave -it to you, of course. Good night, sir." "It should not be a good night, Hayhurst, if I were at leisure; but-look at this manuscript. I have a night's work before me, and cannot help it; but see here, Hay- hurst, not a word below-stairs of the vision!"  said Mr. Osborne, solemnly. "Oh, no, sir, no; and indeed I can only look in the kitchen and say -'How d'ye do' and 'Good-bye' before going." And with a cordial shake of the hands the two parted. But the story that Mr. Osborne was so anxious to keep concealed got wind without the agency of Mr. Hayhurst. Dr. Horne, like a perturbed spirit, wandered over the neighborhood, both by day and night. And if, in his dis- turbed mood, he chanced to meet an acquaintance, he would- be sure to stop' andstell them of the awful spectre that visited his room atmidnight. The house-servants of Rad- nor also now spoke freely of those nightly prodigies. As the days passed, and that fixed upon for the execution of Gerald Mostyn drew near, it was observed that Dr. Horne's symptoms of mania became greatly aggravated. It-was about the middle of the week that Mr. Osbornm  &#xD;<pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC7861-00000208"/> 484-   THi   GIPSY'S PROPiEUTCY. at length went over to Llyndell, and requested an interview with Colonel North. Being shown into the library, where the colonel sat alone, the clergyman closed the door and took a seat, and then and there repeated to the magistrate all that he had been told of the reputed prodigies at Radnor. The old gentleman listened with grave attention, and at the close of the story said-, "I have for some time past regarded Dr. Homrne as a subject of lunacy. I had heard, the report to which you allude, but thought that the reputed ' vision? existed only in the diseased brain of a madman, and that what the master imagined the servants believed. ,Now, however, when you tell me that Farmer Hayhurst, an honest, truth- ful and practical man, believes that he also witnessed this prodigy, I have only to say that the whole thing is probably a piece of jugglery, got up by some enemy of Horne, for the torture of the poor, solitary hypochondriac, and into which it is our duty to investigate. I propose therefore, that you, myself, and Mr. Hayhurst, as the three most in- -terested, proceed to the house and watch through the night in his chamber. If this can be effected with perfect secrecy, so much the more likely shall we be to unmask the impos- ture. What think you of this plan?" "It has my entire approbation. It is just what I myself should have proposed," said Mr. Osborne. "We shall need the intervention of Mr. Hayhurst to obtain, if possible, the consent of Dr. Horne to our watch- ing with him. Will you attend to that part of the busi- ness-?" asked the colonel. "With pleasure," answered the clergyman; "nor- do I anticipate the least difficulty in obtaining Dr. Hornets ready concurrence in our plan.

"Then when shall I see you again on the subject?" "Some time in the course of to-morrow," replied the pastor, grasping and cordially shaking the hand of his old parishioner. And they parted. The same day, according to agreement, Mr. Osborne sought out Farmer, Hayhurst, and opened to him the plan for investigating the mystery at Radnor. He found the way clearer than he could have anticipated. "Sir," said the old man, " the time has arrived when the interference of friends and neighbors is imperatively neces- sary. Dr. Horne is no longer able to direct his own life. Since the final decision of the Minister in regard to Mr. Mostyn has been promulgated--since it is known beyond a doubt that there will be no second respite, and that the condemned man must suffer the extreme penalty of the law on Monday-Dr. Horne has passed every hour in al- ternate raving and stupor. He calls himself a murderer- a double, a treble murderer. Sir, Heaven forgive us all I but I sometimes fear there may be more than mere mania- in his raving." "Strange-strange and terrible.

Will that answer your purpose?" "Perfectly, if you can really effect it." "Certainly I can and will. I hold myself bound to do it." "Friday evening, then, let it be." "Yes, sir." "Good-bye, until then." "Good-bye, sir." And the friends separated, until they should meet the next night in the haunted chamber of the monomaniac. *" CHAPTER XLVII; Oh, tell me, father, can the dead Walk on the earth, and look on us, And lay upon the living's head Their blessings. or their curse?

THE morning of the day upon which the committee of neighbors was to visit Radnor and test the condition of the invalid there, Colonel North sat in his study buried in deep thought.", The old gentleman was not, through all his nature, the relentless judge which some of his acts might lead us to suppose. Proud conservator of rank he certainly was /   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHECY.        437 and, as such, he had repulsed the pretensions of the penni- less young lawyer, Gerald Mostyn, to an alliance with his family. Stern denouncer of guilt he had shown himself to be upon the occasion of Mr. Mostyn's conviction. But if once a suspicion that he had acted with injustice towards a persecuted man insinuated itself into his mind, Colonel North was not one to shun the investigation of the truth. Such a doubt now possessed his thoughts. Many little incidents connected with the history of Dr. Horne- incidents which, taken singly, were of little moment, but, when combined, proved of great weight-Inow arranged themselves into a chain of probabilities, which raised in his mind grave suspicions of the doctor's integrity and start- ling doubts of the condemned,prisoner's guilt;--and these doubts and suspicions once inspired, were necessarily acted upon. Colonel North arose and rang the bell and ordered his horse to be saddled and brought to the door. Then he hastily donned his riding-coat and hat, went out, mounted his steed, and rode rapidly on towards Gwyn, where Lord Starr was at that time tarrying. Two houts of hard riding through the iountain-passes and across the wooded plains brought him to the town. He dismounted at the principal entrance of the hotel, went in, and inquired if Lord Starr was still'in the house. Being answered in the affirmative, he asked for a private parlor, and sent a note to his lordship, requesting the favor of an interview. A few minutes afterwards the Minister entered. They met-they always met--as the best friends. Their political, religious, and social relations were all of the most harmonious nature.  They shook hands cordially, and sat down. After the usual compliments of the morning, Col- onel North opened the business of the interview by saying, with a grave smile-  &#xD;<pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC7861-00000210"/> 48-8    THE- GIPSY'S   PROPHECY. {'Your lordship has doubtless been sufficiently annoyed with the subject of Gerald Mostyn not to desire that topic renewed?"' The Minister replied by nodding and looking inquisitive. "Nor should I have troubled you to-day," the visitor proceeded to say, " had not serious doubts as to the crimi- nality of that man been forced upon my mind." Lord Starr looked surprised and disturbed, without, however, relaxing his inquisitive expression. "Do not be alarmed, my friend; I have not come hither to petition for the farther respite, which I understand has been finally refused." "Yes, it has been,", iterrupted Lord Starr. "Very true; so I comprehended, without the slightest intention to seek to change your purpose; but that which I am about to request of your lordship you may possibly consider a still more improper favor," said Colonel North, with some hesitation. "Speak on, old friend; I beg you; you surely know that there is nothing in which I could serve you that should not be promptly attended to," said Lord Starr, cordially. "I thank you, sir. To my request, then. But first- your lordship has doubtless heard of the strange illness of my neighbor, Dr. Horne?" "Certainly." "And of the still stranger rumors connected with his illness?" "Yes," said the Minister, with a puzzled look. "Very well. To-night a committee of neighbors will assemble at his house and in his sick chamber, with a view to ascertain the- nature and extent of his malady-as to whether and in what degree he may be remorseful or deranged." "Yes?" inquired the Minister, with a look of interest. "Well, I have an experiment to try. And I do entreat   THE  GIPSY'S PROPHBEC.        3 your lordship to believe that it is not impulsively, or with- out mature consideration, that I make the request which I am about to prefer, and which I fear you, sir, may consider as improper as it is unusual," said Colonel North, earn* estly. "Well, well, old friend, there need not be, to a request from you to me, so very much of preface and introduction I I feel sure that you could not make an improper one, and as for the rest, if it be in my power to grant it, I will do so, however unusual it may be!" said Lord Starr, heartily. "Then, my lord, my petition is that your lordship will accompany the Rev. Mr. Osborne, myself, and others, to Radnor, and watch with us in the sick chamber of Dr. Horne,' where I think some light may be thrown upon the guilt or innocence of young Mostyn," said the colonel. "That is indeed an unprecedented request 1" replied the Minister. "It is drawn out by unprecedented exigency, sir." "But on Monday, between nine and twelve, this man is to die." "I know it; but there will be time enough to save him.' "This is a most extraordinary demand!" again ex- claimed his lordship. "I repeat that it is forced from me by extraordinary necessity."              . "And that necessity?" "Will explain itself I at least so I hope and believe, I beg that your lordship will grant my petition and await the result."   -  ' "The interest you take in this young man is altogether a new one, Colonel North, said the Minister. "The interest that, I take is not in Gerald Mostyn, but in the cause of justice," replied the old gentleman. Lord Starr looked down and mused for a few moments; then raising his head he exclaimed- ,           &#xD;<pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC7861-00000211"/> "O   THE  6IPSY'S PROPHECY.

"' I am deeply indebted to you, sir, for your promptness in granting a request which I trust that the result of this evening's visit will justify," replied the colonel, rising to  take leave. That same afternoon, Gerald Mostyn and his devoted wife were alone together in his prison cell. They sat side by side upon the edge of the bedstead, with a little stand before them, upon which lay an open volume. they were engaged, as they had been for many days previous, in reading the Scriptures, and in prayer. The long pressure of an almost insupportable weight of sorrow had so benumbed their faculties that now indeed they were scarcely conscious of the awfulness of their posi- tion. With what power of feeling paralysing grief had left her, Constance seemed to hope even " against hope." And blending with this feeling was a strange, but not un- natural desire--a desire that may not be understood by the happy, but will be easily comprehended by the miserable- it was, that all this troubled- life were once well over, and the peace of the grave attained. -On Monday he must die; she should surely follow him; and then, by the grace of Heaven, would come rest-eternal rest; it was all that they had to hope for; but was it not enough? The shadows, of night gathered darkly over the face of the earth. Black clouds that had been mustering all the evening hung heavily upon the mountain's brow. All out- ward signs presaged an awful tempest. In the gloomy mansion of Radnor, in a remote and darkened chamber, the remorseful master of the house lay writhing under the terrors of a guilty conscience. - 'I i   THeE  GIPSY'7S PROPHECY.       441 He was attended by one awe-stricken old servant, whose superstitious fears struggled with his habits of fidelity, and tempted him to escape' from the haunted chamber.

"Bless you and save you, master, whose voice?" ex- claimed the frightened servant. "Hers! hers! hers!--and it calls for vengeance!" "May the Lord help you, master; say your prayers, and try to compose your mind. It was not a voice-it was the rain and wind." "I tell you that her perturbed spirit rides the storm, and speaks in the wind." "Dear master, there is no troubled spirit except your own I Do, master. try to compose yourself, and say your prayers."

Thus rationally and composedly he conversed until the clock struck ten, when he started, shuddered, and sank into silence. A gloomy silence and a semi-darkness prevailed. The lamps, for want of trimming, burned dimly; the fire had nearly died out; the visitors, under some depressing spell, had'ceased to converse; and -the patient had sunk into a half-stupid state. Thus they remained until the clock struck eleven. At the sound the man upon the bed shivered through his whole frame, half started, and then fell back and relapsed into stupor. The next --hour was one of intense anxiety-almost of Suspended animation-to the' watchers in the chamber. As the minute-hand of the mantel-clock crept its weary round, the very ticking of the pendulum sounded preter- naturally loud and ominous. Without the storm had raged itself to rest. Within, the watchers had dropped into total silence ; the fire -was entirely out; the lamps were burning with long wicks, and red, lurid flames, that only served to maake "darkness visible." The watchers, waited in total silence and with almost breathless interest. What would be the issue of this mid- night yigil? Would the apparition, so well attested by Mr. Hayhurst, again make its appearance? Would it prove to be an imposture that they could examine, 1handle, and unmask; or an optical illusion, visible only to thesiok   tIRE  GIPSY4  S PROPH ECY:  brain of a credulous man? or would it be--?   Who could tell?                ) -Suddenly, out of the deep silence, the clock commenced to strike. Between it and the sufferer on the bed there seemed to be an electric connection, for, with its first vibrating stroke, again his frame shivered from head to foot, tlhough he did not as yet awake; but at eachslow, succes- sive stroke, his form shuddered as under the charge of a galvanic battery. A  s the last stroke of twelve rang solemnly through the darkening room, he suddenly sprang up in a sitting posture, broad awake, with his long arms extended, and his glaring eyes fixed upon the closed door at the foot of his bed. His frame was no longer convulsed, but rigid as marble; his face was livid as that of a corpse; his mouth was open; his eyes almost bursting from their sockets; great drops of sweat started from his pallid brow, from which his dark hair -bristled up with horror I  '  "This is a fit," whispered Colonel North to Mr. Osborne, as they gazed in consternation upon the sufferer; and both cautiously arose to go to his assistance, when Mr. Maraudey from the other side of the bed earnestly motioned them to keep still and wait the issue. Yielding to the greater knowledge and experience of the .old man, the other gentle- men silently resumed their seats and watched the patient, from whose white and rigid lips low and almost inarticulate sounds were bursting. "She is coming I She is coming! Do you not hear her?"  They listened i ntently, but heard nothing except the labored breathing of the stricken man. "Hark!

Look I behold I see her i shehas come to force me to confess 1" The eyes of all present followed the index of that ghastly finger, and, to'their horror and amazement, they beheld-- like a moonbeam in the darkness of the doorway The shape or shade of Alice Heath, palpable to sense as ever she appeared while living I only never living woman looked so coldly pure. Her long and flowing snow-white robe was not whiter than- her still face; her fair, slender hands were crossed upon her spotless bosom; her long black hair, parted over her calm brow, flowed gracefully down upon her white drapery; her eyes were fixed in sad- ness upon the eyes of her destroyer, which they seemed to hold by irresistible power, magnetized to her own. While the gaze of the watchers was yet, as it were, frozen 'to this awful vision, the voice of the dying may arose in shrieks- "You see her-you all see her? It is no illusion, as they said it was 1 You see her I youall see her, as plainly as I do, don't you?" The appalled faces of the spectators avouched as strongly as words could speak that they did. "She has come to me!" screamed the convulsed and ;agonized man-" she has come to me! she has come for iustice I She will have justice I ;Well, she shall have it I   ITE    E GIPSY 'S PROPEOY      4 Ha   I who is that behind her Is it the old man ?

Yes I See I see 1 he raises his venerable hands to heaven I He bows his hoary head in token of assent-do you not note it?" No I the amazed spectators saw nothing but a dark form lurking behind the fair, .luminous vision of Alice Heath and the dying figure of her destroyer-,heard nothing but the astounding confession that criminated himself and cleared the fame of Gerald Mostyn I "There I he extends his reverend hands in benediction, and now he is gone I he is gone P" cried the sufferer gazing into vacancy; then suddenly bringing down his wild eyes, he settled them upon the fair vision that remained un. changed and visible to all, as to himself, and cried- "Ha! Alice! you here still?  Sol I forget I You must have justice, too I Ah-how dark it grows!-how thick the air Hgreat Heaven I can this be death?

Before either of the watchers could make a step towards the bed, their attention was startled by a new prodigy. The fair spirit that had remained all this while un- changed, suddenly dropped her clasped hands,- and fell, fainting as a living woman might fall, into the outstretched arms of Francis Heath, who sprang forward to receive her. ' He'raised and bore, not the shade, but the real living form of Alice Heath, to- the lounge, upon which he ten- derlyiliaid: her;  : 1;l1 was in an instant confusion, though the presence of   All a   IrVSR? ROP F C0Y . , ,  {the de ad, and, perhaps, of the dy ingrestrained noisy de mo raeath bent anxiously over the insensible form of 'his bride, who, under his skillful treatment, s obn breathed again, opened her sweet eyes, and looked prise and fear. p "Be calm, dear one; t hiere is no more need of conceal ment. Trust me, and lie quietly, while I give our friends wondering  spectators, he said-- "  Gentlemen, a few words will explain this seeming pro- digy. The apparent death of Alice in the prison, was a severe attack of catalepsy, brought on by her previous excessive suffering. When her body was given up to me for burial, I watched beside her coffin all night in my study.  A little after midnight I discovered in the sup - posed corpse signs of life. l "In a delirium  ofnewly-inspired hope, I lifted her. from the coffin and-carried her to bed, used all proper remedies, and after an Ihour of anxious effort, I succeeded in restoring her to consciousnss. I filled her empty coffinwith mufled log, and screwed down the lid to avoid detection. ",There was a mock funera,in that case a pious fraud, if such a   thing could be. ' The next night I conveyed Alice to a safe retreat in the mountains, where I thought she would remain in peace, until I could find means to carry her to a foreign country. ,'But her shattered nervous system could not soon be restored to health. Her nervous fits returned, attended with the alarmingfeature of soenambulism. Despite my greatest precaution, and during the time of my necessary absence, she frequently arose and walked in her sleep. ", At such seasons, the one idea ofher life-the clearingt of her fame--seemed to be the motive power of her ucon-  &#xD;<pb n="452-453" xml:id="VAC7861-00000217"/> - .... , .  A-L  t Al J2i Jiv .'Xi scious ac..on. This involuntary impulse no doubt it was that led her, night after night, to the chamber of her per- secutor. "I need not tell you, however, that while asleep, Alice is totally unconscious, and wholly irresponsible for her actions; that when awake she has no recollection of any thing that has passed during her state of somnambulency, and that at this moment she is perfectly ignorant of the momentous events that have just occurred in this chamber, and to which she has been so important a party., Then turning to Lord Starr, the young man bowed with great deference and continued-. :'And H would now most respectfully suggest to the Minister, that in view of all he has heard and seen to- night, his lordship can no longer hesitate as to his course in regard to two  guiltless individuals most unjustly con- victed."                 . Lord Starr bowed stiffly, with the air of one who did not choose to be prompted, and after a short delay, he arose, requested Colonel North and Mr. Osborne to attend him, and beckoned John to show him into the library, where he could be supplied with lights and writing materials. Francis 'Heath seated himself beside the couch of his young wife, who, under his soothing -hands, had sunk into a sweet, natural sleep. The Catholic priest, Maraudey, knelt at the foot of the bed to pray for the soul of the departed; while Farmer Hayhurst, standing on the right, side, closed the eyes, tied up the chin, and straightened the limbs of the body. The next morning Lord Starr, attended by Colonel North, set out for London. As soon as the two pardons could pass .the seals of office, they were entrusted to Co0 onel North, who instantly took the express train down to Gwyn, hurried at once to the house of the sherif;f and placed- the documents in his hands.   THE  GIPSY'S  PROPHECY.      458 That same day Gerald and Constance, who had heard from their friend Francis Heath an account of the events that had transpired at Radnor, sat side by side in the prison cell, with their hands clasped together, and their - hearts filled with solemn gratitude for their own deliver- ance from deep affliction, but not unmixed with compas- sion for the sinful soul now gone to its last tremendous account. Thus in silence they remained, until the door was opened by the sheriff, who entered, bearing a document, whose import might easily be surmised, -and which had been placed in his hands by Colonel North. After a cursory examination of the papers, the worthy officer, cordially offering. his hand to his prisoner, said- "I am happy to announce, sir, that my official relations with you are ended. Permit me to wish you much happi- ness in the renewed life so justly bestowed upon yout, Mr. Mostyn bowed gravely and silently, his heart being too full for speech. 'Geraldl" cried Constance, in a thrilling voice, drop- ping her head upon his shoulder; but for her sovereign self-control she must have fainted. "Cheer up, madam I You have borne affliction bravely I Surely you can bear joy," said the sheriff. Then turning to Mr. Mostyn, he added-- "A carriage, sent by Colonel North, waits to convey you from the prison, sir. And the colonel desires me to- request you to proceed at once to Radnor, whither he himself has gone,;and where, he says, he prefers to meet you."  ,   Mr. Mostyn, accompanied by his wife, immediately left the prison, entered the carriage, and sat out for Radnor. They were met in the hall by their pastor, who cordially shook hands with both, and offered them refreshments.

WNorth prays the presence of his niece and nephew in the library," said Mr. Osborne, with a grave smile, waving his hand towards-the door. is ;  "Come, dear Constance," said Mr. Mostyn, drawing the arm of his wife within his own, and following the clergy man, who led the way from the room. They crossed the hall, and entered the sumptuous library that wassituated on the same floor. There they found Colonel North seated alone at the writing-table. As they entered, the-old gentleman arose and advanced towards them, holding out both his hands; grasping in each a hand of theirs, he said, in deep emotion- "GGerald-Constance-17 can scarcely hope that you will pardon me, for that I also yielded credence to the circum- stantial evidence that convicted an innocent man It will take time to prove to you how deeply I regret that error." "An error shared by the judge, the jury, and the coan- try, sir. We could scarcely expect you to be wiser than all," replied Mr. Mostyn, gravely. - "And you pardon me?" said the old man, squeezing his hand; then turning to his niece, he inquired- "And you, Constance?" "Uncle, I'love you," replied the sweet-lipped lady. "See," said the old gentleman, in a lightened tone, as he turned to the  centre table, "I have lost no time in doing something to atone for my involuntary injustice," and taking up a document, he placed it in the hands of Gerald Mostyn, saying-- "There is an instrument of writing, Mr. Mostyn, that will put your wife in immediate possesion of her fortune." Gerald, with a   grave and silent bow, received the papers. "Let me also remind you, Mr. Mostyn, that, as heir- at law both of your late grandfather and your just departed   THE  GIPSY S PROPH ECY.       455 relative, you stand once more in the home of your fathers. the undisputed master of Radnor." Gerald Mostyn started. It really had not occurred to him that -he had entered upon his patrimonial estate. ' Now a flush of pleasure overspread his fine face. Constance, keenly sympathising with him, now in joy as once in sorrow, clasped his hand and smiled up into his face. "Let me also congratulate you, my friends," said Mr. Osborne, " not on your restored fortune, but on your vin- dicated honor." "Congratulate me," said Gerald Mostyn, in a deep and thrilling tone, as he took the hand of his wife, and turned upon her lovely face a look of immortal love, ."congratu- late me upon something surer than the riches that may 'take to themselves wings and fly away,' purer than the worldly honor that the breath of an insensate multitude may give or withdraw; congratulate me on her whose ' price is above rubies' who alone of all the world remained true to me in the hour of my utmost need, whose faith never failed me in the darkest of days--my Constance, my bride of one morning, my wife for all eternity; above all goods -congratulate me for her, as, above all blessings for her I most thank God."    v  .
