The good Farmer Leslie and his family are such, that we at once love them for their good actions; Staunton and Saville, though entirely different in feeling, both love the beautiful Beatrice, while Amy, Pauline, the Woodvilles, Mrs. King, and the faithful old nurse Sybil, are characters that are excellently drawn. The author carries the hearts of her readers from the commencement to the close of the volume; the descriptions are vivid, the incidents extremely well arranged, and the story is brought to its close with a well-managed pen, which thoroughly under- stands the afrt'of fascinating its readers. We prophecy that it will meet with an usn- precedented sale, as its contents are really meritorious." PHLADELPHA T. B. PETERSON &amp; BROTHERS, 306 CHESTNUT STREET.    <pb n="0-25" xml:id="VAC6462-00000002"/>  Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1865, by T. B. PETERSON &amp; BROTHERS, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States, in and for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.   THE FORSAKEN DAUGHTER. CHAPTER   I. "Day with its burden and heat had departed, and twilight descending  Brought back the evening star to the sky, and the herds to the homestead," "ONGFELLOW. THE fields were ripe for the harvest. A gentle breeze swept over the golden grain as over the waves of a golden sea flashing in the -beams of the declining sun, and with the melody of nature at this her most beautiful hour-the twitter of the birds seeking their rest, the flutter of downy wings, and the rustle of the tree-tops as the little wan- derers darted in and out their leafy homes-the chirp of insects, the hum of the returning bee, and the low of the 'patient cattle, with these were blended the cheerful voices pf the reapers as they heaped high their teams with the rich harvest awarded to their'try. And in perfect keeping with the scene, a neat farm house was cosily placed beneath the shelter of two gigantic oaks, which had probably withstood the storms of a cen-: tury, and whose wide-spreading branches seemed to enfold the little dwelling in a loving embrace. A rude porch, not unpleasing to the eye, stretched along the front, sup- ported by the trunks of unhewn trees, up whose knotty columns the graceful hop-vine with its wealth of golden blossoms trailed luxuriantly, and ranged on benches within this little enclosure, a house-wifely show of milk pana and well scoured kitchen utensils, flashed back the sudL (   <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6462-00000003"/> 26   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER. good night. From the rough rafters overhead was sus. pended a strange medley-festotfns of dried apples, golden ears of corn, and strips of yellow pumpkin, hung side by side with knots of silvery onions, monstrous cucuLmbers gone -to seed, and clusters of sweet smelling herbs. Swallows too had here built their nests, reared their noisy brood and migrated; leaving their little structures secure bor the next year's habitation, like independent landhold. srs who flit their rural homes at the approach of winter. At a little distance from the house stood the pride of ;very good farmer--a large substantial barn, reeking with he odors of the richly freighted hay-mow--attached to ;his building was a corn-crib, and to this a noisy pig-sty, whose several porcine inmates, with their red! noses pro- ruding above the paling, seemed to scent their supper far off t The road trailed its dusky length a few rods rom the house, and the well. beaten path which led there- o from the porch to the little picket gate, "as bordered 3y chrysanthemums, asters, and marigolds, the only attempt ndeed at floral display -which the premises could boast, if, ve except a few tall gaudy sun-flowers scattered here and here about the grounds. This path separated the vege- able garden, which by its abundant yield proved careful ulture, from a fine grass plat kept purposely for bleach. ng, and which even now wore all the freshness and ver lure of spring.            There was on the whole an air of such real comnfor  nd thrift pervading the premises, as seemed to betokez hem the property of one not so rich as to precliude tht ecessity of manual labor, nor on the other hand so pool s to exemplify the proverb, "The poverty of the poor is heir destruction."             l /     THE     A KE ORSA IDET DAUGHTER. 2t Within the farm house, preparations seemed making for a substantial supper to greet the appetites of the return- ing laborers. A large table was drawn into the centre of the cleanly kitchen, at each end was placed a dish of cold meat and vegetables, cakes andi pies with alternate saucers of sweetmeats and pickles, were spread over the snowy table-cloth, while by the side of every plate, with shining pewter spoon, stood a generous bowl of rich yellow milk. Mrs. Leslie, the farmer's thrifty wife, was standing over a blazing fire, busily stirring the contents of a huge iron 'ettle' With a long stick held in one hand, whild with the" other she dexterously let fall a shower of golden meal, preparing the hasty-pudding, or se-pawn, which was to crown the evening repast. Good nature seemed at home in the heart and on the countenance of Mrs. Leslie, and as she swiftly stirredcthe pudding round and round, she sang pleasantly to herself a little song of her more youth- ' ful days. At length she ceased from her labor, lifted the kettle to the hearth, and going to the door, looked and listened for the returning teams. Apparently the reapers were late, and Airs. Leslie beginning to feel somewhat im- patient. Turning to a little girl who had been sitting very quietly upon the floor feeding her kitten and rag- baby from the same porringer, she said: "Run out to the gate, Bessie, and look well down the road, and see if your father and the men are coming-and if they ain't, you may just as well run on to the lot child, and tell them to hurry up, for supper is reAdy. I don't see what keeps them so long," she added to herself, "the sun is nearly dow'-bIess me, why the pudding will only    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6462-00000004"/>   be fit for the pigs to eat by the time they have un. loaded." Away skipped little bare-footed Bsssie up the path: lightly climbing to the top of the gate-post, and shading her eyes with her little sun-browned hand, she stood for a few moments looking far down the road. No teams -were in sight. She could only hear the voices of the men in the distant field, which a wooded knoll shut from her view, so with a bound she sprang into the road, and ran merrily along followed by her frolicksome kitten, which now dancing sideways in her path, now skipping nimbly over the fences, or scratching up the bark of a tree would look down with a soft purr into the smiling, upturned face of the little girl. Bessie had been gone but a few moments, when Mrs. Leslie, whose creed it was never to be idle, stepped out intr the porch, and began gathering the wholesome smell- ing hops into her clean white apron. The sound of wheels aroused her from her employment, and to her sur- prise she saw a carriage swiftly rolling down the road. This was novel event, for, living several miles remote from the turnpike, anything on wheels, unless it might be a wagon or a doctor's gig, was an unwonted sight to the rustic inmates of the farm house. But to the still greater surprise of Mrs. Leslie, watching admiringly the approach of the handsbme vehicle, instead of passing the house, the driveir suddenly drew up his spirited bays at her own gate, sprang down from his seat, opened the car- riage door, and a lady alighting from it, walked with a stately step up the little pathway toward her. Poor Mrs, Leahe was all in a flutter, but with true womanly tact, to look her best, she hastily emptied the hops into a pan,    I   Smoothed down the wrinkled folds of her apron, and giv- ing her cap strings a new tie, was ready with her little courtesy as the stranger ascended the steps. The lady was closely veiled, and her tall person en- veloped in the fleecy folds of a rich cashmere. Thus stately she stood, looking down as it were upon the chubby little figure bkfore her: "Your name good woman?" she asked in such icy tones, as sent a chill through the warm heart of Mrs. Leslie; and the question was again repeated ere an answer could be given.  "My name is Leslie, ma'am-Betsy Leslie." "Have you a husband?" "A husband I dear me yes, and a good one too-Gabriel Leslie is my husband's name."  "And have you children?" questioned the lady. "Only one little slip of a thing ma'am," replied Mrs. Leslie, her round eyes growing still rounder, at the strange curiosity of her visitor. "Very well. I would speak with you within, and quickly too, for time presses--lead the way," continued the stranger. Mrs. Leslie now began to feel a little frightened as well as perplexed, and cast an anxious look in the direction of the wheat field. "Did you hear?" demanded the lady, "I wish to speak with you." "O, certainly ma'am, yes ma'am, please to walk in and rest yourself a bit." -The lady stepped over the humble threshold, and took the chair offered her in silence-then casting a rapid glance around the room as if to assure -herself they were   <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6462-00000005"/> 80   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER. alone, she suddenly throw back the shawl, which she had until now kept folded so closely around her, displaying to the astonished gaze of Mrs. Leslie, a sleeping infant apparently not more than six weeks old. The tongue of the worthy woman was loosed at the sight. "O, the dear darling little thing," she cried, taking the babe, "dear me what a little mite I why it hasn't any more heft than a feather, poor little dear I but won't you have some nice fresh milk for the darling ma'am, and a glass too'for yourself?" Without noticing this kindly meant hospitality, the lady said:      - . "You then have but one child?" "Only one living, ma'am. . I have buried three dear babies," answered Mrs. Leslie with a saddened counte- nance, "three, ma'am-well, well poor things they are better off I know-but it is a hard thing to have one's pretty little innocent baby taken away from your sight i" and a tear trickled down the cheek of the bereaved mother, as she bent down and kissed the infant she held in her arms. "Then perhaps you would like to take this little girl and bring her up as your own," said the stranger in a softer tone. "Goodness why you don't mean so I you ain't in earnest sure," cried Mrs. Leslie, opening her eyes still wider, and staring first at her visitor, and then at the sleeping infant. "I am in earnest, and this is my business with you," was the reply. '! This child I wish to dispose of-it is not mine, and the very sight of it is hateful to me. You are not so rich I imagine as to be indifferent to money --   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     81 and therefore you will be glad to take the child. ; Here are fifty dollars, she is yours," and this was said in a tone which seemed to forbid all hesitation or denial. "From time to time you will;receive the same amount," she con- tinued. "Bring her up as your own, and for your own sake you will be careful never to let her suspect she is not your child. You never need trouble yourself to discover who she is, or who I am-you know just as much now as you will ever know. The child is two months old- she has no name-you can call her what you please." So saying, and without casting even a parting look upon the little babqe the-ady rose from her seat, drew her cashmere gracefully about her, and with haughty step left the house, entered her carriage, and was driven rapidly away in the same direction whence she came, leaving poor Mrs. Leslie almost stupefied with wonder, still stand- ing with the unconscious babe in her arms. "Well, I never!" at length exclaimed the good woman, sinking down into a chair, "mercy on me, what will Gabriel say I dear, dear, dear, what shall I do With it- you poor little thing you, what shall I do!" Lost to all else6 in her perplexity, Mrs. Leslie heeded not the sound of the approaching teams, creaking heavily under their rich burthen-the swinging back of the large gate for them to pass through, nor the cheery voices of the reapers, as with songs and laughter they gee'd the i- tient oxen on to the barn, and stranger than all, ie childish merry voice of her own little Bessie, who mounted upon the highest load, with her little curly head just peeping out from the golden sheaves, was palling, "Mother, mother, do come and look at me!" even:this failed to arouse her.' * \*     .  ie.    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6462-00000006"/> 32:  THE  FORSAKEN     DAU. GHTER. "Halloo, wife, here we are at last!" cried Ithe farmer, entering the kitchen, followed by several jolly reapers, "pretty hungry too I promise you--but wh t-why in the name of creation, what have you got there, ife? a baby ha, ha, ha, look neighbors, a baby, ha, ha!" for Mrs. Les. lie, half laughing, half crying, still sat with the child upon her lap. The men now all gathered around her to look at the babe, which, disturbed apparently by their rugh voices,  slowly unfolded a pair of large black eyes, and looking upnto the face of Mrs. Leslie, its little redlips parted with a smile. That mute appeal was enough. The chord of maternal sympathy was struck, and gave forth a sweet response in the kind heart of Mrs. Leslie, and with aloving kiss, she folded the babe to her bosom. She then hastened to relate, as well as her agitation would perimit her, the visit of the mysterious lady, and the singular manner by which the little stranger was left upon her hands. A frown gathered upon the face of the farmer as he listened- to her recital, and harshly he said: , "Well, what are you going to do with it I we want no rich man's cast off bantlings to eat up our honest labors: )ou were a fool, wife, why didn't you throw it after the worthless woman who brought it here!"  Mrs. Leslie, having no answer to give her husband, killfully evaded the question by dandling the babe back and forth in all imaginable ways to attract his favorable notice, exclaiming at the same time: "Only see, Gabriel, isn't it a pretty little thing now   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.    33 just look at its bits of hands, and feel what a soft smooth. skin-the poor little dear-isn't she pretty as a picture?" "Hang its picture! I asked you what you were going to do with it," said the farmer, doggedly. -'Do with it-do with it, Gabriel? well, I don't know,  I am sure-love it and take care of it, I suppose." "That's you, Betsy Leslie, you are the woman for mer" cried a sturdy younog farmer, giving her hand a hearty shake, and theri catching the babe from her, he began tossing it up and down, though somewhat awkwardly, it must be confessed, "why it's a regular little beauty, bless it! why look here now, neighbor Leslie,'" he continued, "I tell you I would not mind having such a pretty present myself." "You are perfectly welcome to this one, Mtarry Gor- den,' said the farmer, half laughing, "for it is as much as one pair of hands can do to find bread for the mouths hon- estly mine to feed, Without taking in all the stray babies that come to my door in grand coaches!" "Dear me, why, I forgot-bless me, what did I do with it, how careless!" exclaimed Mrs. Leslie, now hur- riedly getting up and shaking her dress; "Why, where on earth can I have dropped it, I wonder? O here it is l" and stooping down, she picked up the fifty dollar note from the floor, where it had lain unthoughltof until the present moment, showing how little of selfishness there was in the heart of this worthy woman. "See here, Gabriel, why the little thing isn't going to be any expense to us after all--there" (handing him the bilD "look at that, and the lady said we should receive just such a sum from time to time-now what do you say i" i      i 1!      *           i * !;     <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6462-00000007"/> 34   THE  FORSAKEN' DAUGHTE R'. "Fifty dollars, ehl well that alters the case some to be sure--fifty dollars is a good round sum, neighbors, though I must say, I have no particular fancy for fathering 9ther people's children even at that pricel "Well!" exclaimed Mrs. Leslie, fondling the babe, '-she said it was not her child-there was no need of telling me so, I am sure, for what mother could have gone off and left such a poor helpless little thing among strangers, and that too without a kiss or even a look I such a pretty baby too-I declare, Gabriel, if the little thing isn't laughing right in my face! come take her, won't you, while I dish up the pudding--there be careful, now do--dear, dear, why you'll let her fall as sure as you live!" "Don't be troubled, wife, I won't drop the little animal, only make haste with the supper, for we are confounded sharp-set, I tell you."          , The babe stretched out her little arias lovingly, and opening wide her beautiful eyes, fixed them intently upon the sullen countenance of the farmer, as if to reproach him with his selfishness. "Well, this young one is no fool at any rate," said Ir. Leslie, his features relaxing itto a smile, "did you ever see such a knowing look as the little thing gives me-ha, ha, ha! come, don't cry, baby, I guess we shall like each other pretty well, after all," and drawing the little face up to him, he kissed'the brow of the innocent babe. A"4h, Gabriel," cried the exulting wife, who had seen the action, "I knew you would love the little darling. There, give her to me now-supper is ready, and you must all be pretty hungry by this time: I am afraid the pudding won't be very good, but never mind, you must try and make shift with the cold meat and pies."   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     85 The men quickly drew around the table, arid showed their appreciation of her good fare, and the strength of their appetites by falling to with great zest. In the mean time, Mrs. Leslie warmed some milk, and fed the little stranger, who manifested on a smaller scale, quite as good an appetite as her elders. 3Besie,.perfectly wild with joy at having a baby to hug and fondle, held the porringer, laughing loudly each time the little mouth opened so knowingly to receive the spoon; and at length, when her mother, with a kiss, told Miss Baby she had quite enough for once, seemed never to tire of softly pat- ting the tiny hands, and peeping at the cunning feet tucked so snugly away in the soft folds of her little blanket. "And now, Gabriel," said Mrs. Leslie, drawing her chair to the side of her husband, "what shall we name the baby?" "What the dickens, hasn't the young one got a name?" exclaimed the farmer, swallowing a large draught of milk.                   I "No-she said I could call the child just what 1 pleased." "Oh, did she! how kindl then call her 'unwelcome, I can't think of a better name for her." "Now for shame, Gabriell come, what shall it be? sup- pose we call her ,  " "Dolly 1" interrupted one. '"Or Dolly Ann!" said another. "Or Jemima!" added a third.

"Amy!" answered her husband, turning away his head. "Ah, bless you, dear Gabriel, that is just like you /'Yes, Amy,-I wanted to call her Amy!" It was a name sacred to their hearts, for it was that of a favorite child which God- had taken from their arms the summer previous. "KIiss her, Gabriel," said Mrs. Leslie, holding up the infant.  i The tears of the bereaved parents fell together upc n its innocent brow, and thus was the little Amy baptized into their affections.

And the blue heaven o'er arches all! While the events of the preceding chapter were taking place under the humble roof of Gabriel Leslie, a far different scene, .and yet one intimately connected with it was pas- sing in a distant locality-the one near the banks of the beautiful Owasco, the other amid the green hills of New- England.  . Not in chains, nor caged like some ferocious beast,- not with tattered garments and matted un-combed locks was the poor victim of insanity, whom we must now bring before the reader.

This room was situated in one! of the wings of a large building devoted to the reception of the insane. The aspect was light and cheerful. A few paintings were hung around, illustrative of some beautiful scenes in na- ture, such as might please the eye, and soothe the troubled mind to dwell upon.-Landscapes, through whose gentle sloping hills quiet rivers traced their silver path, or moon- light. casting its mellowed rays across the waters of some little lake deep set in wooded banks.

Tears like pearls still rested upon the cheek of the sleep- er, whose features, so perfect in their repose, seemed chis- eled from the purest marble. The slender fingers of one little hand were still entangled amid the thick tresses of dark golden brown, which fell over the pillow in beauti- ful disorder, as if in her anguish she would have torn them from her aching head-the other was gently held by a tall venerable man with a most benign aspect, who stood by the bed-side, attentively watching the countenance of his unhappy patient.  .  \ No sound discordant disturbed the quiet of that little room, and as the eve glanced through the open casement, it seemed as if nature too sympathized with the scene.

"Does she never speak of any one but her babe?" asked the doctor. "Yes, poor thing, the' but seldom,-and when she does it is in a low shuddering tone, and as if she was half dead with fear.

"Well, we must take off this mourning my dear, and dress you in white," said the doctor with a smile. "Not white! not white!-for white is for weddings,- shall I tell you, I once had a White garment, but do you know it all fell to ashes'" / The poor girl shuddered and buried her face in her hands as she spoke, When she again looked up, the piteous expression of her sweet countenance so moved the kind-hearted doctor, that he was obliged to turn away to conceal his tears: "Listen now," she continued;, putting her little hand in his, and bending upon him her mournful eyes,--it was the prettiest little creature, and nestled to my bosom like a little dove, and when I felt its soft cheek, and heard its gentle breathing, it calmed my soul to peace-and when , ,    r I *    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6462-00000011"/> 42   THE  FORSAKEN   DAUGHHTER. my mother-yes, when my mother stood before me with her great burning eyes, then I held my baby tighter to my bosom, for you know they could not scorch into my heart then But sometimes Ithink they did--for one day I could not find my baby, and ever since my heart seems on fire 1"And here the unhappy young creature began to weep and moan.  "There there, my dear,--come dry your eyes like a good child,-now tell me more about your baby," said the doctor passing his hand caressingly over her pale brow, and smoothing back her disordered tresses, hoping there- by to gather even from the incoherent ravings of insanity some clue to the mystery which hung around her. She smiled: "Do you love to hear about my baby? it is not dead-- no, I am sure it is not dead I how could such a pretty little thing die, for it was an angel already, And it was so well, and slept so sweetly upon my bosom, and I held its tiny hands, O how tiny in mine--until one day--hush,- put down your ear--one day they came-you know who, and-Oh my poor heart-I slept a long time, I believe, ah, such a sleep!

DECKER. HE doctor's young and interesting patient had been brought to the establishment late one evening in a close carriage, accompanied by a lady and gentleman. Nearly insensible she had been lifted out and borne into the house. It happened unfortunately that Dr. Woodville was from home, and the young physician left in temporary charge of the patients failed to obtain any information respecting her. He was told 'by the gentleman, for the lady did not alight, that she was brought- to the institution for treat. ment of a most unhappy malady,-that from early child- hood she had been subject to long periods of insanity, and that after having been in several establishments for the insane, and receiving no benefit from their course of treat ment, her friends, had now as a last resort, brought her to -Dr. Woodville, whose s Lccess in such cases was so widely known.      i                   i   i ,             I THE  TORSAtEN    DAUGHTER*.     4 When asked her name-it was refused, on the plea that her unhappy relatives did not wish to make it public. Af- ter placing in the hands of the physician a handsome fee the gentleman then took leave. The interest which Dr. Woddville felt in his patient was extreme. So young, so lovely, and so innocent too, as he felt assured she was! It filled his great heart with pity, as he watched those mournful eyes looking out from darkened chambers; or listened to those tender accents ' which, alas, gave forth only the fleeting fancies of .deli- rium. Every day confirmed his suspicions that the state- ment made by the person who brought her to the institu- tion was false, and that her state of mind had been pro- duced by some great-affliction-he feared cruelty; andhe spared neither mental toil, or patient careful watching to restore reason to its rightful throne. i The hopes of this excellent man were not doomed to disappointment, nor did his almost parental solicitude prove vain.              [ One day after a more violent paroxysm than usual she fel into an uneasy slumber, and when in the evening Dr. i Wooldville visited her room, as it was his custom before. retiring, he was surprised to find her in a raging fever. For many days the result seemed doubtful: So feeble, so helpless she lay there,- the thread of life worn seemingly to its frailest tension by long suffering-uttering no com plaint, and, passively receiving whatever the doctor or nurse gave'     her, nor aain was heard that plaintive cry "my baby! my poor baby!" At length she sank into a heavy sleep, from which should she ever awake, Dr. Woodville predicted it would be with her mind restored. Hour after hour he watched  .   .         .    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6462-00000013"/> "  THE  FORSA-KEN   DAUGJHTER. byher bed-side, never leaving her except when compelled to attend the demands of his other patients, and oft re- peated were the cautions whiCh he gave the nurse, when thus obliged to absent himself; and the good woman might have felt a little nettled had not her own interest in the case overcome every other feeling. Upon one of these occasions, the nurse was left alone with the sufferer. She by no means belonged to the "Gamp" school of nurses, and yet, notwithstanding ,  all the octor's strict injunctions, Mrs. Boyd closed her eyes in sleepl induced thereto partly by the stillness which per- vaded the sick chamber, broken only by the ticking of the watch upon the little stand, itself a lullaby in its warn- ing monotone, and partly by the soft wind -which ca e fl6ating in on the flowers it had snatched in its rand m flight over orchard and meadow.

But for a better reason were the eyes of the good nurs  weighed down, yiz.:-from the want of that sleep which for many nights had been a stranger to them, in her fears for her patient. And so Mrs. Boyd slept. The sleep of an anxious watcher is never log, how" ever worn down by fatigue nature may be, and in less than half an hour, the nurse awoke.

To her surprise the eyes of the patient were open, and met hers with a calm peace- ful look which made her heart leap with joy, for she saw at a glance that the doctor's predictions were verified: "You are better," she said, taking the little thin hand in hers with a kind pressure. "Yes, better I think," was the faint reply: "I have slept a long time have I not?" "Yes, dear, you have had a nice nap, and must need a little nourishment,-here is gruel, take a iittle won't you?" She languidly swallowed the few spoonsfuls which the nurse gave her, and then casting her eyes slowly around the room: "Will you tell me where I am?"' Sle said. "You are with friends my dear young lady," replied Mrs. Boyd, anxious for the return of the doctor at such a critical moment: "Is-is my mother here?" was asked in faint, broken accents. i No my dear, she is not."

Their eyes met with a smile which spoke their pleasure at the favorable change in their pa- tient:  "Yes, yes nurse, I shall scold as bad as you do some- times. if you talk to my patient, and if my patient talks, why 1 shall scold still more," said the doctorl cheerfully. t'Ah, this is as it should be," he continued, placing his fingers upon the slender wrist,--the pulse the' feeble, re- sponding healthfully to their pressure: "you are better, much better my child.--we shall now do very well, with care tho', with care. The invalid turned her languid eyes upon the speaker, and as they met their kind, benevolent expression, new hope and strength seemed given her': "You are very good to me," she said smiling: "Not a word my dear young lady-I am a selfish old man and must bargain to do all the talking myself for a day, or two, until yeu gain a little more strength: you are with friends who wil take good care of you, so don't make yourself uneasy, but like a good child, do just as the old doctor tells you. I will see you again by and by." Then taking the nurse aside he gave her the necessary directions, and with renewed charges ibr caution and quiet, left the sick room with a much lighter heart than he had entered.     l The mental and bodily sufferings of the invalid had been too severe to warrant a rapid improvement, and lit was therefore several weeks ere she was able, even with the assistance of the nurse, to walk around her pleasant chamber. \    THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     49 During all this time she made no allusion whatever to the events of her past life, nor spoke again of that pain- ful theme which had so engrossed her delirium. Dr. Wodville was sedulously careful that nothing should be- tray her present locality,--nor, indeed, did she apear to have the least suspicion that she had been under treat- ment for other than bodily disease. She was very sad, often in tears, yet grateful for the kindness and sympathy which she received.        : One morning Mrs. Boyd was summoned away upon a Case of urgent duty, and Beatrice, as we will now name our invalid, was left alone. Fortunate are those who know not from painful experience that ennui which so often op- presses the convalescent of a long and dangerous illness- that weariness of the mind which seeks relief in a con. tinual change-yet finds it not. The books, which Dr. Woodvile had that morning brought her fresh from the publisher, failed to interest-her drawing too was soon thrown aside, and at length, without any pu pose save for change, she threw open the blind and sat down by the window. 'This opened upon a beautiful lawn, whose smooth velvety surface was broken here and there most agreeably to. the eye, by small groups of fruit and for- est trees, now in all the balmy luxuriaree of 'leafy J une;' and ofteh before, as the, eye of the invalid (had caught the soothing influence of their beauty, she/had longed for strength to wander within their inviting shade, and now as she sat there, the hand of sum- mer dallying with the light curls which shaded her tem- plels, she was seized anew With an irresistible desire to enjoy the beauty of the morning, free from the ungenial ' l the beauty of '-ue         ngen/    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6462-00000015"/> 60   Z THE FORSAKEN   DAUGHTE R. atmosphere of a sick room-so, throwing a light shawl about her, she stepped out upon the lawn. In unison with the pleasant scene about her, pleasant thoughts:stirred her bosom-the bitterness in which her young life seemed steeped was momentarily removed Prom her, andi an expression of unwonted cheerfulness brightened her fair face. And so she rambled on. Now stopping for a moment to rest herself upon some rustic seat placed under the shady trees-now to gather a flower from the carpet beneath her feet,-to listen to the joyous song of the birds, or to inhale the fragrance of roses, Iwhich now, in the perfection of their beauty, made redo- lent the air. She soon found herself in another part of the grounds, which were even more beautiful-they were certainly more varied in their beauty. Here were winding walks leading into pleasant shades-arbors netted with roses and sweet honey-suckles,-here a miniature rail-way with its graceful little hand-car, traversed its' nicely graded cir- cuit, while suspended from many trees,' swings gently vibrated with the motion of the wind. This portion of the grounds was devoted exclusively to the pleasures of the female patients, and here those who could be trusted without the surveillance of a keeper were permitted to stroll at will. Fatigued by her long ramble, and perfectly enraptured with the scene, Beatrice sat down upon an inviting little bank, and began arranging her flowers. While thus em- ployed, she saw a fine looking woman approaching her, whose singular dress at so early kan hour, caused her some Surprise. She was in white--a'blue scarf-was thrown carelessly over one shoulder, and confined to her bosom L1   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.      51 by an immense bouquet, while a wreath of bright red roses was twisted in the thick masses of her black hair. "Fair Ophelia, I salute thee 1" said the stranger, waving her hand gracefully as she drew near. Not for a moment suspecting her malady, yet humoring the conceit, Beatrice smiled, and handing her a spray of flowers, replied in the words of Ophelia: "There's rose-mary-that's for remembrance, and there's pansies-that's for thoughts i" "Maid, I accept thy offerings, and place them here,- remembrance is a good jest, it makes one so happy!" said the woman, taking the flowers, and putting them in her bosom.  "Now, fair Ophelia, I create thee one of my, nymphs,-I am the goddess Flora. Follow me-let us scatter flowers over all the graves before the moon goes down," so saying, she walked away, pulling her bouquet to pieces and casting the flowers before her. Beatrice now saw many females walking through the grounds,--some were in social groups of three and four, laughing and chatting apparently with great gayety- others walked moodily away by themselves through the, most secluded alleys-some were reading aloud-others de- claiming with all thb pathos of tragedy queens, and again others, leaping and dancing through the walks, would break forth into wild laughter and snatches of song. Suddenly a young girl, with a rapid step, approached the spot were Beatrice still sat bewildered by the scene, and catching her violently by the arm, cried: "Get up, false girl-get up! you know you are on the grave of William!" then throwing herself down upon the ground, she began to weep and groan bitterly.

"That poor girl ought to be sent to an Asylum," re'  marked another, gravely, addressing Beatrice; "in my realm we take care of such people"!" The limbs of Beatrice could haidly support her as she found herself lifted thus rudely from the ground Frightened too at her situation, for she could no longer mistake the character of those surrounding her, she turned to escape from the scene. But she felt sick and  faint, and ere she had gone many steps, she was obliged to stop and lean against a tre6 for support. At this moment, an old lady with a most benign, aspect approached her.                      "Lean on me, madam," she said, with a kind smile, of- fering her arm, "don't be frightened, for I assure you these poor creatures, who, as you see, are not in their right minds, will do you no harm. I am sent to look after them, and to take care of them-they love me, and such is my power over them, that so long as their eyes turn to me, they are perfectly quiet and happy. This is a' charming morning, madam-I am sorry your walk has been so disturbed-lean on me, you seem weary."' Reassured by these words, Beatrice took the arm of the kind old lady, who continued to converse with her pleasantly until they reached the lawn whence her foot- steps had first strayed. Here her guide stopped, and dis- engaging her arm, bade her good morning, saying: "I must leave you now, and return to those unfortunate beings who are under my charge and my protection. If you are ever in any trouble, call on me and I will aid you. I am the Virgin Mary 1" When, in the evening, Dr. Woodville visited Beatrice, he found her busily engaged in writing.

But he saw she had now penetrated the secret, and what to say the good man did -not know. Beatrice saw his embarrassment. "Won't you tell me?" she asked again. "Some other time, my child--not to-night--wlen you are better, and. really, my dear, there is not much to tell." "Yes, to-night, dear doctor-tell me now--I am well- strong!" Concluding it best to relieve her anxiety at once, rather than suffer her mind to dwell upon the subject, Dr. Wo6d- ville now, with great tenderness, and in as few words as possible, related the circumstance of her being -brought there, and of the singular manner in which her friends left, without either name or adcdLess. She listened attentively, and as the doctor concluded, she kissed his hand, saying: "And you knew not even the name of one -so forlorn, so wretched, and yet how patiently you bore with my 1  0    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6462-00000017"/> 54   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER. infirmity I ah', doctor, how can I ever repay such disin terested kindness 1"  "I am paid already, and more than paid, my dear girl  by having been the instrument under heaven of your re- storation," answered Dr. Woodville. "One thing more I wish to ask you," said Beatrice;   "will you tell me, what were the wanderings of my shat- tered brain-of whom did I speak? and did I reveal     aught which, in my right mind, I might wish to keep r secret?"                        e "'No, my dear child, you did not-and during all the  0 time of your illness, you spoke only of your mother, and  of your baby."  Beatrice struggled to subdue her emotion, and in a few moments, looking up at the doctor, she said:      i "I am very young, as you see4-a very child, and yet I  am a widow. I was a mother too, a happy mother--but my sweet flower, too frail for earth, soon drooped and died I some day, my best friend, if you will listen to me, I will tell you the events of my short but wretched life." More than ever touched by her lonely, and, as it seemed to him, friendless situation, and warmly assuring her of his sympathy and friendship, the good physician soon after bade Beatrice good night. Dr. Woodville went home to consult his good wife upon the practicability of removing Beatrice to his own residence. He feared to have her remain longer under the roof with his other patients, lest the association, in her present weak state, might be productive of the most disastrous events. Mrs. Woodville was a nervous little body, but her heart was the seat of all kindness. She had always been ex-   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     i 6 zessively timid with regard to the unfortunate persons under her husband's charge, and it was but seldom he could -induce her to accompany him to the seat of his benevolent labors. When she did so, she would cling nervously to his arm, and speak toi the patients if they chanced to approach her, as if humoring the fancies of' a sick child, or coaxing a pet lap-dog, and no argument which her husband could make use of, would ever in- duce her to be left alone with them for a moment. When, therefore, the doctor spoke of bringing Beatrice home, she felt a little nervous about it, and inquire:,anx- iously if he considered her quite sane. Relieved upon that point, she now eagerly seconded all his wishes, and a pleasant little char her was soon prepared for their guest. It was with a grateful heart that Beatrice, the next morning, accepted the invitation of the doctor to accom- pany him home, and Bidding an affectionate adieu to the worthy Mrs. Boyd, she soon found herself rolling rapidly away from those walls which, now that she knew their purpose, were fearful to her 3    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6462-00000018"/> CHAPTER IV.

MANY are the lovely valleys of New England, and often has the artistiA skill of the painter, and of the poet, traced in lines of beauty the praises of their birth-right- New England, a name so dear to her children. In one of the pleasantest of these pleasant valleys, yet unsung, but worthy to be sung, was situated the residence of Dr. Woodville, half a mile distant from  the Asylum under his charge. It was a fine old mansion, standing upon a gentle ac- clivity, overlooking a landscape of almost 'unsurpassed loveliness-not a point but told to the eye trained to ap- preciate the charms of Nature. To the right werel moun- taina crowned to their summit with fragrant pines, their dar verdure in beautiful contrast to the silvery birch and maple, which here and there swept aside with their more graceful branches this stately evergreen. Huge rocks too might be seen crowned with leaves like some grim old Satyr, peering out from the mountain-top upon the world beneath, or sliding down in fantastic groups, view their   stony faces in the, mocking river, which threw back strange pictures of their sullen dignity. On the-left, far as the eye could reach, were scattered villages and towns, their spires pointing solemnly to the God "who sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the hills," and "crowneth the year with goodness." Isolated cottages gleamed pure and white from out embowering orchards, while sun-beam and shadow chased each other over fields of undulating beauty; and giving light to the landscape, the Connecticut sped on its way rejoicing, darting in and out like a frolicsome child at play in the meadows those glorious meadows, spread forth like rich mosaics tesselated by the hand of the husbandman. Such was the view which met the eye of Beatrice as she stepped from the carriage. Mrs. Woodville stood at the door to welcome her guest. A pleasant face she had set in bands of silver-the nicely crimped border of her cap resting lightly upon that soft gray hair, and confined under her chin by wide strings of muslin,-indeed she had two chins, but they were excel- lent neighbors, laughing and growing fat together. -Her dress was the perfection of matronly propriety,-the glossy black silk fitting so neatly the plump proportions of her form-the handkerchief of spotless lawn plaited in grace- ful folds over her bosom-the long sleeves nearly tight to the arm, and terminating in a narrow frill, just becomingly shading the hand, where, unchanged as the affection which gave and the trust which received it, shone the wedding. ring, with which, thirty .years before, the lover of her youth, the dompanion of her age, had encircled her Standing tere framed, as it were, in the flower in- woven sprays of the sweet honey-suckle which garlanded    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6462-00000019"/> E FORSAKEN    D;UGHTER. the porch, she formed a pleasing picture of serene old age. And yet it must be confessed, the bosom of Mrs Woodville was not quite as serene as one might suppose. A little nervousness mingled with her welcome of Bea- trice. To the apprehensions of the good woman the at. mosphere of the asylum still clung about her, and she in- voluntarily shrank aside, as if fearing the pale languid young person whom her husband was now leading-toward her, would suddenly break forth into some wild ungovern- able fit of lunacy. She advanced a step to meet them- then ,ervously retreated, looking the while anxiously at her husband, until finding herself really compelled to speak, the first words which suggested themselves were those which she ever employed in addressing the doctor's patients.               I  Reaching forth her hand timidly, she began stroking and patting Beatrice on the shoulder, saying in a soothing tone: "There-there-it's me, I've come to see you dearl pretty-pretty." "Yes cmy dear wife, I know you are happy that my young friend has come to see you-but you must not flat- ter her by telling her she is 'pretty' to her face," inter- rupted the doctor, hardly able to repress a hearty laugh at the perplexity of his worthy lady, and prudeitly giving a different version to her words. Beatrice, however, had not noticed this singular address of Mrs. VWoodville. She felt the hand so gently placed upon her shoulder, but to her it was only a pleasing mani- festation of kindness. The merry twinkle of the doctor's eye aroused Mrs Woodville to her absurdity, and now, banishing her fears,   THE FORSAKEN DAUGHTER.   59   she led her young guest into the house, kissed her affec- tionately, and removing her bonnet and shawl hastened to bring her some refreshment. After partaking of a tempting lunch, the doctor issued his commands that his patient should  etire to her own room, and there seek the. repose which. the excitement of the morning rendered necessary. Mrs. Woodville herself conducted Beatrice to the cheer- ful little room appointed her, but no sooner did she find herself alone with her visitor, than all her fears again came crowding upon her, and when in thefullness of her gra- titude, Beatrice threw her arms around her neck, and in words broken by emotion, spoke her thanks, she almost screamed with terror, and hastily disengaging herself re- treated backward step by step, and with a most ludicrous attempt at a smile, again had recourse to some of her usual phrases, as: "Soh, soh-poor fel-low-sohl" until she reached the door, which she hastily opened, and as hastily closed af. ter her, and then sank down upon a chair quite over- come. Beatrice was a little puzzled to account for her strange manner, and for a moment was inclined to think the doc- tor's good wife quite as mad as any of his patients. ,Not five minutes had elapsed, however, ere there was a gentle rap at the door, and Mrs. Woodville re-appeared quite abashed and mortified at her conduct, which a mo- ments reflection betrayed as so inconsistent. She now ten- derly embraced Beatrice, assured her that the interest she felt in her was quite equal to that of her husband, which she thought was saying a great deal. Indeed, it appeared   <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6462-00000020"/> 60'  THAE' FORSAKEN     DAUG   TER.  as if in the kindness of her heart, she could neither say P or do enough for the comfort of her guest. When, at length, left to the quiet of her chamber, Bea- trice sank upon her knees, and her heart went up in grate- ful praise to Him who had so blessed her with friends in this her hour of desolation. She feared she must soon be torn from this peaceful haven, and she prayed for strength and courage to meet the trials which she knew would then await her, and she prayed too for forgiveness upon those who had made her young life so wretched, well nigh de- stroying the light of reason forever.*  The health of Beatrice now rapidly Improved. There was ever some little plan forming for her enjoyment,'-in plea- sant weather there was charming drives with Mrs. Woodville in her little pony chaise, or quiet strolls through the cool shrubberies--should the day prove unfavorable for such  i excursions, there was the excellent library of the doctor open to her. A piano too lent its cheerful influence, and under the graceful touch of Beatrice " discoursed most ex- cellent music." But on such dayswhen the soft rain-drops in beads of silver came leaping from flower to flower and from leaf to leaf of the twining honey-suckle, filling the air with sweetness--when thelglad meadows, and the hill-sides, and the mountain-tops waved their arms to welcome the soft summer rain, and the birds piped their sweet notes from out their leafy shelter-upon such days, while Mrs. Woodville, ever busy for the necessities of others, industriously plied her needle, Beatrice seated upon a little footstool by her side would i1    ,  !            i        *' THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.     61 "Read from some humble poet, Whose songs gushed from his heart; As showers from the clouds of summer Or tears from the eye-lids start," for "Such songs have -power to quiet The restless pulse of acare, And come like the benediction That follows -after prayer," How much Beatric wished she could remain under that peaceful roof forever--yet as her health returned, she keenly felt the delicacy of her situation.

The doctor was one to whom the " human face divine"  J was as a lettered page, and he read at a glance the evil  passions of that man's soul: cunning, hypocrisy and  malice were thereon plainly typified-illumined, one might say, by the small snake-like eyes whose light   i seemed kindled at unholy fires.              / Intuitively the doctor knew the errand on which his  i visitor came, even before his lips. were opened.  "Dr. Woodville, I presume," said thestranger, advancing ! to meet him. "I am most happy, sir, to make personally   the acquaintance of one whom, by distinguished reputa-   tion, I have so long known."  -The doctor slightly bowed to a speech evidently in. tended to flatter.                    , "Some months since," continued the stranger, carelessly  itapping his boot with the riding whip which he held in   his hand, "perhaps eight, perhaps ten, I left an unfor   tunate young woman in your charge.

"Ah, true, I recollect-I had tot the pleasure of meet- ing you at that time. I left the unfortunate girl with one of your officials." "Her name?" asked the doctor. "'Really, sir, you must excusm me.

Vaulting into the saddle, he plunged his spurs rowel deep into the sides of the noble animal he bestrode, and gallopled rapidly away. ' This interview the doctor confined to his own breast, mentally resolving that, without her free consent, he would never give up the charge of his protege to such friends as he deemed his visitor but a fair type. $ A few evenings after this occurrence, ias. Beatrice was about retiring, she placed in the hands of Dr. Woodville a small manuscript, saying: ' "Here, my dear friend, is the story of my life.

CHAPTER V.              : ' Memory be still! why throng upon the thought  ! These scenes deep-stained with sorrows sable dye i" I BEATTIE. I I AM an only child. Of my father, I have no distinct  recollection, for I was but six years of age when he'  I died. Sometimes it is true, from out the indistinct pic- tures of childhood, there comes to me a pale, sad face, which smiles upon me lovingly, or I feel a gentle kiss upon my brow, and then I hear a hollo w racking cough, and some- thing tells met-it is my father. In my dreams this vision often returns. Until my sixteenth year, I was strictly secluded from society. My summers were passed in the country with a faithful old servant of the family, and my winters at my mother's -town residence, which was situated in one of the most agreeable streets in New York.  I was but sel- dom allowed to leave my own  apartment, unless my mo- ther was without company, when I  was: sometimes per- rmitted to dine or pass the evening in her society, These occasions were rare, but eagerly anticipated--for my mo.  ther was usually surrounded by a  throng of gay visi-   THE]  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER   .   6  tors, and I therefore saw but very little of her, indeed, weeks would pass without our meeting. She was then, as now, most beautiful, and I remember when a verylittle child with what awe and wonder I looked upon her, as, -radiant fin her loveliness, and resplendent with jewels, she would sometimes glide into the nursery,-and when I grew older, and felt so much the want of a mo- ther's sympathy and kindness, how my heart yearned for her affection, and sometimes I could scarce refrain from falling on her bosom and beseeching her to love me. Yet she ever repelled my caresses, and my efforts to obtain her approbation by close attention to my studies, elicited but femt praise. I have since learned to interpret more clearly the, mo- tives which prompted my careful seclusion. ' o She was beautiful, and it' was her pride to-appear as young as she was lovely in the eyes of the world, whose adulation she coveted. To be the mother of a tall, grown up girl was a time-telling fact rather annoying, and pro- bably there were many of her fashionable friends who did' not even know of my existence. It was on my sixteenth birth-day that my mother came into my little study, and embracing me affectionately, told me, after some hesitation, that she was about being married, and. that she wished me to dine with her ori that day for the purpose of introducing me to Mr. Staunton, her in- tended husband. Never had she appeared so kind, and never before had I felt so happy.           / Believing that my mother's marriage, was not only to bring me into a more intimate union with her, but also introduce me to that world which my fancy painted as so charming, I iridulged in the most pleasing anticipations.

Even now she stands before me. She had selected from her costly ward-  robe, a robe of pale yellow satin, which she wore looped over her bosom by a spray of beautiful pearls, disclosing a bust of surpassing loveliness, shaded, not concealed, by i a fall of the finest lace. Her sleeves lined with white satin  and edged with lace, were open from the shoulder; dis. playing in their graceful sweep, the matchless contour of her arms, fairer than the pearls which encircled them. Her hair, that lustrous black hair, which had ever been my I admiration, was wound around her temples in a style pe-  euliar to herself, and interwoven with pearls, formed a graceful and fitting coronet for her almost regal brow. Thus radiant did my mother stand before me. Yet with my appearance, she was evidently displeased, for a frown contracted her brow, as she glanced over my dress. At this I felt excessively mortified, as I had be- stowed unusual pains upon my toilet, aided too by the taste of my good governess; and going- up to her I said: "You do not approve of my dress my dear motherl" Without replying to me, she turned to the governess: "I am astonished, Mrs. Eaton, that you will allow Bea- trice to assume the young lady quite so soon--her style of dress and the manner in which you have suffered her maid to arrange her hair, is really too absurd for a mere ,child." )  i"A child, Mrs. Lorrainel Beatrice can certainl* no' longer be considered as such-she is' sixteen to-dayl" re- plied Mrs. Eaton.  / "But I choose to consider her a child," interrupted my mother sharply, and you fail extremel in your duty  : '   1   1    *   \    '* ,l    THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER,     69: Madam, if you encourage her to copy the airs and address of an habitftee.

"And more like an over-grown babyl" said my gover- ness. My mother made no reply, except by a withering look, and slipping her arm through mine, now led me down stairs. As 'we entered the drawing-room, a gentleman advanced quickly to meet us, and judge of my surprise, when, in-; stead of the staid middle-aged person whom my imagina. tion had naturally suggested as about to become my step- father, my mother, with evident embarrassment, presented me to a young man, with a gay dashing air. as Mr Staun- ton; His surprise seemed even greater than mine. He had probably anticipated an introduction to some playful little child, who would spring into his arms, and toy with his rmoustache-one with whom he could romp, and kiss and coax, or feed with bon-bons, as he did my mother's pretty little king Charles' spaniel. It was no wonder then that he could not dissemble his surprise, as his eye fell on me-a great tall girl, indeed, I am no taller now, who came blushing into the root, partly from timidity, part- ly from mortified vanity, at the waxen doll-like dress in which the dignity of my sixteenth -birth-day was brought low-resolving itself into the ' over-grown baby' which my governess had pronounced me, 6          I  ' I'       X         <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6462-00000025"/> 70  'THN  F O RSAKEN   DAUGHTER  I shall never forget the expression of my mother's countenance, as her eye closely watched his, reading his thoughts as printed words. From that hour my nhisfortunes began--for unhappily, although so soon to lead my mother to the altar, Mr. Staunton immnediately regarded me with an interest, which excited her anger and jealousy, and I was suddenly sent from home to a boarding school, a few miles distant from  the city.                       i Nor was I sorry to leave, for since my introduction to I Mr. Staunton, I had been exceedingly annoyed by his at- tentions.

I asked for my mother--and then he told me that he could never marry her-that it was I alone whom he loved--that he had loved me from the first mo- ment he met me, and that I must be his wife! I was no lopger a timid girl. I felt the wrong done to my mother, for I knew she loved him, and I felt the insult to myself. In words bitter and defiant I bade him begone, rior did I at. tempt to conceal ipy perfect detestation both of him and his odious proposals. He attempted to seize me in his arms-and--Istruck himI Then with an oath for ven- geance he left me. A week passed and I saw him nolmore. At the end of that time, I was surprised one morning by a visit from my mother. There was nothing in her manner which in- dicated any unusual excitement, she. was perhaps more kind, andIventured to inquire after Mr. Staunton. At the 'mention of his name her countenance changed, but she answered indifferently, that he was well, adding that i in a few weeks their marriage was to take place. She then told me she had come for the purpose of taking me with her to visit some relatives residing a few miles dis- tant from the seminary. I gladly ran up stairs for my bonnet and shawl.

Upon the front seat, sat a gen tleman-a stranger, whom my mother introduced as Mr. Effingham; and with whom she at once began to chat in a free and confidential manner.  Not feeling any interest in their conversation, I threw up my veil, and leaned from the carriage window, to enjoy the fine breeze sweeping the forest boughs, under which we were gently bowling along-listening to the joyous  song of the bob-o-link, or watching the flashing oriole  darting like a ray of sunshine through the green foliage. ! How can I proceed I how pen the dreadful scenes which  followed I Ere I was aware, my hand which rested upon the car- riage-door was suddenly seized by Mr. Effingham, and carried to his lips--the action accompanied by words which, in my indignant surprise, I did not understand. A Snatching my hand away, I instantly turned to my mother, expecting her to resent the insult, as I felt it to be; but so far from doing so, she only smiled, and patting me on the cheek with her fan, called me "silly girl." Thus encouraged Mr. Effingham again attempted to take my hand, uttering at the same time, the most ful- some compliments. I would not answer him,0 but drew my veil closely over my face, and leaned back in the car- riage. Instead of rebuking his rudeness, my mother laughed at my annoyance. Nothing daunted by my re- pulse, he now spoke of an elegant ccuntry-seat which he owned, upon the banks of the Delaware--praised the great beauty of the grounds-the charming landscape-- the valuable conservatory, and- then, leaning forward *,   THE  FOR SAKE N   DAU   HTE R.   7 until I felt his hot breath even through my veil, he whispered: "And of this residence, my lovely girl, I hope soon to make you the mistress." "A charming little wife she will make, Mr. Effingham, all artlessness and, simplicity." There was a bitter taunt in these words which I well understood. "Yes, Beatrice," continued my mother, now turning to me and throwing aside my veil, "Mr. Effingham   loves you, and has asked your hand in marriage--an offer which I have not hesitated to accept." "Mother!"I gasped. "Why, you silly girl, you look frightened to death! Really, Effingham, I believe the child ,has read so mqn y fairy tales, she thinks you are a wicked enchanter about bearing her off to some horrid cave, instead of your charming country-seat upon the banks of the Delaware." "Say, beautiful girl, why that pallor?" cried Mr. Effing- ham, now seizing my hand and pressing it to his lips. "Smile on me, my bride-my Beatrice--nor longer avert those beautiful eyesl" "Mother!"I exlaimed, "What does this mean? why am I thus insulted?

Mr. Effingham now placed his arm around me--he for- cibly drew me to his bosom, and breathed anew-the most ardent professions--assured me that his whole life should be consecrated to my happiness.  Then I appealed to him. I threw myself upon his generosity.-I appealed to his sense of honor and justice. I entreated him to release me, to take me back to the Seminary. I even promised, at some future day, to be- come his wife I but iny appeals were all in vain. - He only replied by his odious caresses, saying: "Lovely Beatrice, I cannot yield up such happiness- you plead too charmingly "    - Again I turned to my mother.

'Yet, why dwell upon my misery-why distress you by the recital of my tears, my prayers, my vain supplica- tions for mercy? Nearly insensible, I was lifted from the carriage and dragged to the altar, and there forced by my cruel parent to become the wife of one I did not know, but whose appearance filled me with disgust. We entered the church, and had taken our places at the altar ere the clergyman came out of his vestry. My mother carelessly drew down my veil, that my tearful countenance might not cause suspicion. - I looked at him as he entered. He was a stern-featured man, yet I felt an appeal to him would not be in vain, and I attempted to break from Mr. Effingham, that I might throw myself at his feet and claim his protection.

I expected to die-but death had no terrors for me--it was life I had to dread I But for one thing only did I de- sire to live--and now on the borders of the grave, as I felt myself to be, I yearned to see my mother. Dying, she would pity me, and take to her bosom with tenderness, that precious gift for which alone I wished to live. She would receive my baby from my arms, and when the grave should have closed over its unfortunate mother, she would then love it, may be--for my sake. At my request, the physician in charge of the hospital wrote to her, and at the expiration of a week she came. I was then a little better, and had that morning for the first time been lifted from my little cot, and placed in a large chair, propped up by pillows. They told me she was there, and forgetting all my wrongs, I felt as if I could fall upon her bosom, and pour out my thanks that she had come to me. The door opened, and my mother entered. There was music to me in that familiar foot-step, so light and grace- ful; and as she approached, I extended my pale, sickly hand, and smiled, weeping as I smiled. She threw back her vail-my tears congealed around my poor heart-my smiles faded ghastly-for that look wasmarble 1 She did not speak at first, but turned away, and walked to the window.

"Once there was a little voice, Merry as the month of May." BARRY CORNWAILL. I TRUST the reader has not forgotten the little stranger who came so unceremoniously to take her place as one of the family at the pleasant farmn house. She is, to be sure, a very small affair, but babies are little despots, and will be noticed: they have a certain winning way of command. ing our attention, which we must obey, and our little Amy was as worthy to wield her tiny sceptre as any babe in baby-dom.  And most effectually did she exercise her sway over the hearts of Farmer Leslie and his good wife. Through the cold winter, which so soon came with its sweeping mantle to enfold the broad harvest-fields, and the crusted snow lay white around the farm house, and that hardy little fellow, the snow bird, would come hopping along in his little brown boots, pecking away at the icy crystals-when the old oaks, cased in glittering armor, rattled their spears, and shook their arms, as if in defiance of the rushing blast-when the hail and sleet beat against   TH:E  FO*RS AKEEN  :DA UG HTER.     85 the windows, and winter, bearded with icicles, whistled fiercely at the door, or, when the merry snow-flakes came dancing down, hand in hand, wreathing every tree and shrub with fairy garlands; through all that long winter what a sunbeam was that babe under their roofl She was only a baby, a wee little baby, but she diffused warmth, and life, and pleasure around her. Lying there so cosily in her little wicker cradle by the fireside, laughing and cooing at her own plump fingers, or making desperate attempts to feed on her! chubby little toes, did she not make the music :and the sun-shine in which Mrs. Leslie moved cheerfully through her daily labors. And at evening, when the frymer would come in from the forest, which :had all day resounded with the ring of his axe, and the cattle were foddered, and all things made snug -for the night, then would he take the crowing babe in his arms, and stroking her little face with his great brown hand, would kiss the round rosy mouth, and say:  ';Well, well, what does it signify-what' a little more milk, or a bit of bread I so Betsy, if you are content, I am sure I am." And Mrs. Leshe was not only content, but - nervously apprehensive that some day, the little fairy would flit as suddenly as she came. Perhaps the name, which they had given the deserted little one, linked their hearts more closely to her. For who, that has ever lost a dear child by death, but has felt the thrill which a namne -so sacred, so dear, sends to the inmost depths of our feelings-the name of a lost one I It is forever hallowed in our hearts.  It is a name, not    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6462-00000033"/> 86   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER. like other names, to be spoken carelessly. Sometimes we hear it ringing on the gay voices of childhood, as a troop of merry chidren bound past us-anc. we turn to see- not ours, but some happier mother's childl again the name drops from the lips of a parent,-some bright- eyed youth, or lovely maiden answers to the call--we look at them through dimned eyes-we think of our dead, and our hearts grow sad-and yet it is good to know that, "6 He whose love exceedeth ours, Hath taken home his cifld I' Amyl Amy was the watch-word then, by which ten-. derness and love so soon gained their hearts. The young farmer, Harry Gorden, whose whole-hearted zeal in the cause of the little one, shamed the rather selfish feelings of Mr. Leslie, at her, firs't advent among i them, lost none, of his interest in the child. Every morning, as he went to his labor, he must call at the farm house, to watch her welfare through the night, and at evening again, to watch her welfare through the day. Little Amy too soon began to know him, and would stretch out her little arms as he drew Lear, -and then withl coo, soft as the murmur of a dove, she would cuddle own lovingly to his bosom; but when the summer came, and she could just run alone, and would toddle to Xmeet him, her tiny feet peeping up like snow-berries through the green grass, then was Harry's delight beyondl bounds. Amy's reign was established. It is needless to say that the attempts made to pene- trate the mystery which hung around their- protegee were   THE   FOR SAKENI  DAUGHTER,     87 unavailing--indeed, they had not the means to pursue their investigations far. The nearest post town from Leslie Farm was Auburn, which-at the period my story dates, stood in all its primi- tive simplicity, of a few white cottages, with sloping red roofs, at the extremity of the Owasco Lake. It might then perhaps, have realized Goldsmith's apostrophe, i "Sweet Auburn! loveliest village'of the plain!" \,    '                * for it was before rail-roads had so strung villages and towns together, as some writer remarks, like " white beads upon a black thread." How changed, "Sweet Auburn" has be- come since then, every reader knows. To Auburn, therefore, did Mr. Leslie repair, and made inquiries at the one tavern, the blacksmith's shop, and the village store. But mine host declared, by his empty till, that no carriage had stopped at his door. Vulcan gave, a blow upon his anvil, and swore he had shod no strange horses, and the m night, not only of the yard stick but of Quintals and hogs-heads, had seen no strange carriage- no strange lady I And so Mr. Leshe was obliged to return home, unsatisfied. Let us give one picture of our little, Amy, ere we leave her again for older, and just now more important per- sonages. It is her birth-day, as her adopted mother chooses to call it, for that day twelvemonth did she come in her helpless- ness, appealing so touchingly to her heart. It is again evening, and again the jolly reapers have returned from the field. The haryest-moon vailed like a queenly bride, lingers on the ejastern sky, waiting until the sun shall have    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6462-00000034"/> 88   THE   FORSAKEN' DAUGHTER. buried his burning gaze. beneath the horizon, ere she comes forth in all her majesty, to walk the heavens with her starry train. The robin pipes his notes as he hops sociably up and down the garden walks-the night-hawkl has come abroad, cleaving the air with his dusky wing, and swoops to the earth with a wailing cry, like the moan of a lost spirit.' The toils of the day are over, altho' not idle is Mrs. Leslie, for as she sits in the littleporch, with skilful hands she swiftly plies her distaff, and as the little spinning wheel buzzes round and round, obedient to her will, the silky flax assumes new strength and usefulness. And see young Harry Gorden,* as he stands with his head thrown back, the dairk hair sweeping from his open brow, and the little Amy held aloft, poised in his sinewy hand, about to spring, as it would seem to the bosom of her father, who with a pleasant smile holds up his arms to catch her--yet mark, how like a little Icoquette, she coyly extends her tiny hands, and then with half averted face, looks down with a joyous laugh into that 'of Harry!  There is golden haired Bessie, t6o, in the fore-ground of " our sketch, seated upon the grass, dressing her patient kit- ten in little Amy's apron, while honest old Cato by her side, looks down with grave dignity upon her proceed- ings.  And thwart this picture of rustic happiness, the mellow autumn sunset pours its golden rays.

His fortune had not only resolved itself into the " air " he gave it, but, " like the baseless fabric of a vision, left not a rack behind 1" Mrs. Lorraine, blinded by her exceeding vanity, had not a doubt that her charms alone brought the dashing Staun- ton to her feet, and such was the eloquence of her lover, such the power of his insinuating manners, that she truly felt the passion he only feigned. The offer of his hand was accepted with -a thrill of happiness, a gush of real feeling such as a heart like her's, so wedded to the world, and so much the slave of fashion, experiences perhaps, but once in a life-time. It was like one simple natural flower, giving perfume to a vase of beautiful, but artifibiial roses. Mrs. Lorraine loved her daughter-that is, she gave her just as large a share of her affections as she could possibly spare her, in a heart naturally good, perhaps, but which personal vanity, flattery, and extreme selfishness had per- verted from all the true tenderness of a mother's love. She would probably have been astonished at an imputa- tion of neglect or want of maternal affection! As a babe, she pronounced the little Beatrice a "' love," a " cherub"- would sometimes glide into the nursery, before she went to the Opera, or to some brilliant party-dressed her beau- tifully, and sent her out every day with nurse for an air- ing-what ,more could any reasonable baby demand!

It was not however until obliged to produce this " wit-  ness' before Huibert Staunton, that her jealousy took a tangible form. Jealous of her ehild's artless grace and loveliness Il What power must selfish vanity exercise over any heart that can thus turn to bitterness what should be a mother's tender pride and care I Now-keen as the. serpent's tooth was the pang with which she noted her lover's ad. miration of her daughter. And Staunton called that admiration-lovel it was such love as the rattle-snake feels for the poor little bird, that will soon flutter to his fate, When then "4severe in youthful beauty," Beatrice spurned his addresses, revenge took possession of his soul.

After the enacting of that tragedy, in which Beatrice was the heroine, and Staunton the satanic mover of the plot,- the marriage with Mrs. Lorraine, was postponed. She was now in his power through her pride and her love, and with consummate skill did he exercise it to his own advantage. The chain of Hymen, tho' forged of gold, was not to his taste, so under various pretences, he borrowed her money. One day he would be the ardent lover-the next, insolent and overbearing. Nor did he take much trouble to conceal his elegant vices, and if Mrs. Lorraine remonstrated, or with stern dignity, resented his conduct, then he would taunt her with her love--and  threaten to betray to the world the wretched fatel to which she had consigned her only daughter, through jealousy of her and love for him. Keenly did that proud woman, feel the galling yoke. She loved Staunton too, with all the inm tensity of her being, and what was more humbling-he knew it I  When J she received that frst touching letter from Beatrice, when the noble girl, struggling to bear her: sad lot, wrote to forgive her mother the wrong which she had suffered at her hands, her only feeling iwas anger. So blinded was she by the artifice of her lover, that she deemed this letter a mere subterfuge.. Effingham had solemnly sworn to take Beatrice to Europe, and funds had been supplied for that purpose-why had he not done so then? It lwas, that not to be torn from Staunton, Bea- trice had'prevailed upon him to break his oath. And again, when apparently dying, Beatrice besought her to   THE ,FORSAKEN     DAUGHTERB.     93 come to her, it was not as a fond mother anxiously seeking the bed-side of a suffering child, that she com- plied, It was that she might banish the innocent offspring of her daughter from sight and memory. The physician, who attended Beatrice, knew her name, for he had written her at her daughter's request-he knew she was -the mother of his patient, and should the babe survive its unhappy parent, might some day be sent to claim her protection. i This must not be. She formed her plans -accordingly. If there is anything which can palliate the step she took, it is that when she tore the babe from its mother's arms, Beatrice was so low, at the time, that her recovery was [ pronounced impossible-else she would not have robbed her of her treasure, and then when reason gave way under so much suffering,' and Beatrice, unhappy girl, became a maniac, Mrs. Lorraine thought she had acted wisely. She jealously guarded the secret of Beatrice being still in the country from Staunton, but even her art could not ) circumvent his. He followed her to St. Louis, and sud- denly stood before her at the bed-side of their victim. The hand of Providence now surely interposed in be. half of that poor, suffering child, leading her persecutors to place her where she was to be rescued -from their power, and made happy.      - The worldly prospects of Hubert Staunton suddenly brightened. A fond old aunt, who could discover no fault in her steady, moral nephew, who came twice a year into the country to visit her, who went with her to church, and uttered the responses with so much fervor and - piety, left him thirty thousand dollars in her will, because- poor old lady; she knew he would make such good use of it: ltI    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6462-00000037"/> "   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.

Such was the fury of his passion, such his frenzied gesticulations, that he might readily have been taken for an escaped lunatic. iLittle did he dream how near he was to the object of his Search-that even as he galloped so furiously down the road, her white garments were in sight, and that had the clattering of his horse's hoofs been less violent, he might, perhaps, have heard her voice.

And here stood  the dwelling of Mrs. Lorraine, fronting the beautiful Park, whose rich, deep verdure and luxuriant foliage seemed to whisper t   the lover of Nature, of meadows and moun- tain-tops, even above the citys' hum. It was early evening, and Mrs. Lorraine alone' in her ' boudoir.  The rich curtains of pale, rose colored    satin were partially drawn aside, and moonlight swept in with                           /   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.      97 ber silver robes, flooding the room with beauty. A gen- tie breeze brought music too, and blended with the mellow strains, came the gay, happy voices of childhood, as, tempted by the moonlight, troops of little children still kept at their sport beneath the trees of the Park. The scene was one of repose-inducing that delicious longuor which insensibly steals over one on a calm' summer's night like this, and apparently Mrs. Lorraine felt its influence. She sat with her queenly head resting against the crimson covering of a Voltaire-one fair hand fell listless by her side, the other held an open book, as if  day had faded so silently into the mellow moonlight, she had but now turned from its pages. Her robe was of delicate muslin, gathered in graceful folds ovr her bosom, on which reposed a simple moss-rose-her only ornament. Not unbecoming her severe beauty was that air of pen- siveness resting upon her faultless features, giving a soft- ness to her brilliant eye, infinitely more charming than whensparkling with all that wit and gayety which she took wi th her when she went forth to the world, or which made her own drawing-rooms so enticing. Old Time in his flight must have felt the witchery of her beauty-kept back the silver hairs with which he would have strewed her temples, and so passed silently on--for now at the age of forty, Mrs. IJorraine was still most lovely. But of what is she thinking as she sits there? Are her thoughts loccupied with the book which her hand still clasps? is she thinking of her daughter-of Beatrice! not so--else her features could not wear that placid smile.

See how eagerly she listens. A footstep comes nearer-nearer--see, she half rises to meet the visitor, and then quickly reseats herself, as the door is thrown wide, and "Mr. Staunton!" announced. The next moment Hubert Staunton is before her-fiot in a dress suited for the boudoir of a fair lady, but with garments travel-stained and disordered. He had but now left the steamboat, and without stop- ping at his lodgings, hastened to St. John's Square, that his travelling. dress might speak to Mrs Lorraine of a lover's impatience, He had formed his plans with his usual adroitness. His first move was to gain her confidence, by those tender i professions, that witching eloquence of lip and eye which none could better assume:  "' For when he listed he could weep and pray, And when he listed he could fawn and flatter." And if this failed to win from  her the secret of Bea- trice' s abode, then to demand it. "And lether, beware how she dare refuse me!" he ex. claimed.  With such thoughts he now presented himself before her.  Taking her hand,he pressed it fervently to his lips.  "Years have passed since I saw you last, dearest friend, could I compute time by my feelingsl". he exclaimed. "So great was my impatience to see you, that I have flown'to your presence in a garb which ill befits the bower of beautyr'   THE  FORB    N R A D A H TF I.  99 "You flatter me. And yet, when I assure- you your absence has seemed an age, I do not mean to flatter you," said Mrs. Lorraine, as her lover threw himself at her feet, and looked up into her eyes with such an expression of tenderness, as made her heart thrill with happiness. ' Flatter I why should we make use of flattery I where heart speaks to heart, as the eye answers to the eye I you look charmingly--how well that simple robe becomes you I and yet you are paler than when we last met-would I might think my absence the cause 1" Mrs. Lorraine passed her hand caressingly over the brow of the speaker, as she replied:  "And you left so suddenly, too, my dear friend, without even an adieu 1" "Ahl do I not know it!" was the passionate reply. "Have I not felt it every hour of my absence I an affair, of immediate importance,' hurried me away, and I was forced to leave you--but my heart was here. How often, Anna, did I wish you were by my side-for never have I seen the country wear a more-delightful aspect.

"In what direction have you been traveling, Hubert? "East. My business led me to a-beautiful little village in the Connecticut valley, a charming spot, where, satiated as I am with the fivolities of the city, I could be content to pass the remainder of my days.

The reply was given in a mute pressure of the hand, ,and a look of affection which Staunton knew well how to interpret he continued: "New England out-rivals all her sister States, not so much, perhaps, in the grandeur of her scenery, as in her rural loveliness. A more beautiful spot than D A , I am sure can no where be found." "D   -I have, you been to D    ?

Here she sat and listened to his insulting address. Not once did she interrupt him, and only by the firm compression of her lips, the ashy paleness of her brow, dould one detect how keenly that serpent was striking his venomed fangs into her heart. But now, as he concluded with those last taunting words, she slowly arose, her stately form drawn to its full height -her head thrown back, and her eyes flashing defiance-- she stood there like some beautiful Pythoness, illumined tin the rays of the calm moonlight streaming around her: Raising her arm she pointed to the door.

Woodville laid down the manuscript which Bea. trice had given him-took off his spectacles and wiped them carefully with his silk handkerchief, for they had be- come very dim-he had probably wiped them just as care- fully a dozen times since he had began the narrative--and then putting them  on again, he looked over at his good wife, who in her large rocker sat at the other side of the table listening to the story. Large tears were slowly trick- ling down her cheeks, rolling off in'silvery beads upon her black silk dress, and her fingers were nervously jerking her knitting needles, which gave forth a sharp click-click. click, as if they were chuckling at the good lady's distur- bance. The sight of her tears seemed to act as a cork-screw upon the' eyes of the doctor, for his spectacles suddenly became so very dim, that dashing them off, he exclaimed:   THE  FORSAKEN   DAUGHT    .  1Q "Why my dear--I really-I am ashamed, but I must do it "And with this apology, he threw his handker. chief over his face, and gave full vent to his emotion.

"Poor fel-lowl" said Mrs. Woodville, leaning over and stroking her husband's hand. That "poor fel-low," spoken in that wheedling tone she used to his patients, changed the doctor's tears into a se- rio-comical smile: "Well, wife, I believe I am a little beside myself-but this poor girl's story has really made a child of me'" "It don't seem natural to me," said Mrs. Woodville,' "it is just like those stories we read in novels-it does not seem possible, that. anything so dreadful should have really happened,!and that the heroine, if I may say so, is under our own roof."  "'Truth is sometimes, you know, stranger than fiction,' my dear wife.

"Stay with you, my dearest friends!" exclaimed Bea- trice, overcome by her emotion. "Stay with you--O would to heaven I could! but even now, I fear each moment I may be torn from you.

Affectionately taking her hand, he said:  "My dear girl, I have read your sad story, and-what my feelings were as the unhappy details developed them- selves, I will not attempt to describe. It is needless to dwell upon it, for it will only distress you, and fill me with renewed indignation.

Dr. Woodville now informed her of his intention to go abroad for a year o? two on her account-that he should immediately resign his situation at the Asylum, and in as short a time as was possible to adjust his affairs, leave America.

But that could not be, her safety was at stake-to that mother, her very existence, must if possible, remain a secret. Sometimes a strange presentiment came over Beatrice, that her little babe was not dead! she could not account for the feeling, but something seemed to whisper her "your babe lives /' At her request, Dr. Woodville wrote to St. Louis to gain, if possible; some information upon the sub- ject.

She was impatient to begone. She longed to place the wide ocean between herself and those whom she feared every day would find her out and drag her from her kind protectors. And now the three were seated in the piazza looking for the last time upon the lovely landscape spread out before them, and with a graceful touch Beatrice sketched the scene, that, when 'in a distant landfshe might some- times gladden the hearts of her dear friends with a view of their "Home sweet Home." The rich glow of sunset had not yet faded from the   west, but in long rays of golden ligoht still shot upward, gilding thne mountain tops, and resting upon the village spires, like the blessing of God upon the sacred Temples which they proclaimed, and so stretching far away the wide spread landscape of hill and dale Was lost in th6 i dim distance.

The next day found our travellers in Boston,.and the wind being fair, at ten o'clock the following morning they went on board the Champion, soon to bear them from their native land. Mrs. Woodville submitted to her fate with a martyr- like resignation worthy to be chronicled. She had no doubt they would all be drowned-she was sure of it I the moment she came in sight of the vessel, she imagined she saw it sinking. It was!not until she was on board, how- ever, that her firmness: gave way. It happened unfor- tunately for her stoicism, that just as she placed her foot upon the deck, it became entangled in a rope, and had not a sailor caught her in his arms, she would have fallen. As she raised her head and saw the good-na- tured tar supporting her-his shock of Otiff black hair, surmounted by a red woollen cap, jauntily stuck on one side, his whiskers, long and shaggy, nearly- covering his face, and the sleeves of his red flannel shirt rolled to the elbow, the poor woman was frightened. Forgetting where she was, with a ghastly smile, stroking his brawny arm, she said: "I've come--to see you dear--pretty, pretty!" Fortunately at that moment the doctor appeared and led her to the cabin, where a violent fit of crying was fol- lowed by ditto of sea-sickness: "I say Jack," said the sailor to one of his ship-mates, "did you see that old frigate on her beam ends? there she goes under convoy-she has'nt got ballast here--d'y    <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6462-00000050"/> 120  !THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.  understand!" touching his head significantly. Then rol- ling his quid of tobacco in his cheek, joined his ship-mates around the capstain, and with their cheerful "yo heave yo," the anchor was soon weighed, and the Champion stood gallantly out to sea. i Si   THE   FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER     121 CHAPTER XI- ' Fair blows the wind-the vessel drives along, Her streamers iuttering at their length, her sails , \ All full,-she drives along, and round her prow Scatters the pcean spray."

When our little party, therefore, took possession of their state-rooms, it was with the belief that for the next thirty days the good ship Champion was tobe their home. Beatrice, happily escaping X!that zal-de-mer which renders every one so miserable whom it attacks, soon unpacked all the little coaaforts and necessaries which had been pro-,  vided for the voyage, and arranged all things as pleasant as she couldfor poor Mrs. Woodville, who gathered into her berth with a feeling that she was in her coffin, lay "rocked i in the cradle of the deep," sick, disheartened, fear-stricken. The unceasing bustle upon the deck, the tramping of feet, and creaking of the cordage-the cries of the sailors, the trumpet voice of the captain issuing his orders, and the waves dashing against the sides of the vessel, over- whelmed the pocr woman with terror, and, for the first week of their vo age, Beatrice confined herself almost exclusively to thel cabin and the bed-side of her suffering friend, and it was not until the good lady begin to think that, on the whole, she would prefer not being thrown overboard, an office that she had repeatedly begged her husband to perform for her, and concluded rather to take chicken-water than sea-water, that Beatrice went on deck to look abroad upod the boundless ocean, through which the no le ship was now cleaving her way. Oh, the grandeur of the scene as she cast her eyes around--one mighty mass of waters! and her heart thrilled with an awful sense of the majesty of God.: For   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     123 a moment she closed her eyes, she could not look, she Could not have spoken. x "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firma  ment showeth his handy-work." "Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, who maketh the clouds his chariot, who walketh upon the wings of the wind!" said Dr. Woodville, solemnly, as he passed his arm around her. "Raise your eyes, Beatrice, and look upon this glorious expanse, and tell me how it is possible for any one to doubt the existence of a God I Let the skeptic stand here with me--would he seek a more grand display of His power, would he look for a higher. manifestation of the Almighty!

White fleecy clouds specked the heavens, as mirroring the foam-crested billows on the blue deep below--sea-birds too, were soaring gracefully mid sea and sky, now swoop- ing to the surface for their prey, then again rising from the boson of the wave to pursue their trackless flight. ' HoW much I   wish. Mrs. Woodville was well enough to come on deck-I think she would lose her fears 1i this glorious scene, and feel that God is here, and that He will  protect us " said Beatrice, as she turmed with reluctance to go below. i'Well, my dear, you must use your eloquence, but I very much fear she will be a prisoner to her berth the re. mainder of the voyage," replied the doctor.  - nd when Beatrice proposed to Mrs. Woodville to go on deck, she. lifted up both hands, in amazement, and asked her if she thought she could. walk, when everything teetered up and down. That day, for the first time, Beatrice accompanied the doctor to the dinig-table, where, to those with whom he had already formed an acquaintance, he introduced her as his daughter, and of course she was designated as "Miss Woodville," There were not many passengers. There was a clergy- man seeking the-bland air of Nice for the winter, a family of six persons going to Paris, an artist bound for Italy, an English tourist "taking notes," a literary lady on her travels, several merchants seeking foreign looms, and a few others of no pat'ioular moment.

Champion were soon quite on the footing of old acquaintances. The unaffected grace and artlessness of Beatrice made 1 a most pleasing impression iupon all. There was some- thing exceedingly winning in her smile-it seemed to crave your pity and your love; for it was impossible that her guileless countenance should not have caught sadness from a heart so swretched as hers had been, and although Dr. Woodville could every day see the shadow passing off, and an expression more congenial to her years taking its place, yet there was a touching look about her which. no one could see without feeling an interest in her. Dr. Woodville soon became a general favorite. Nothing could be done without "Dr. Woodville," and even the -little children on board must all refer their disputes to him, ! whether it was of the becomingness of a dollrs dress, or the arrangement of a troop of wooden soldiers. His tall figure, the mild expression of his dark, gray eve, his long, white hair falling back from a brow on which benevolence had' set its stamp, these commanded     : the respect of the passengers, one and all, at first sight, and when they came to know him, his cheerfulness, his desire to promote their happiness, and his ready acquiescence in all their projects, soon gained itheir love. Indeed, the doctor and his daughter were great favorites. a There was one person to whom the charms of Beatrice     i were a study--a study in which all things else were soon absorbed. He was an admirer of beauty in all its forms,   . whether of Nature or of Art-it had been his study, his     <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6462-00000053"/> 126   T'IE  FORSAKEN   )A UGHtTER. dream for years. The mountain-top bathed in sun-lit clouds, the little wild flower peeping from the crevice of some jagged rock, the wild river rushing on its course, the tiny brook- prattling by the road-side-to. him all these were beautiful! they spoke to his inmost soul of the power and love of the Creator, and his heart arose in gratitude from "Nature, up to Nature's God." So too, a landscape, glowing from the canvass, as if Na.-  ture had portrayed herself with her own magic tints, a beautiful statue, a skillful piece of mechanism, complex, yet obedient to the master-will-these too were all beauti- ful to him, for they spoke to his longing heart of ithe triumph of genius, heaven-inspired genius I He had first seen Beatrice, tho', unseen- by her, that morning when, speechless, motionless with awe, she had first looked abroad upon the majestic sweep of ocean.

And, from that moment, she became his beau-ideal of all that was lovely, pure, and graceful. .- This person was Paul Saville, the young artist, who was now with a strong will, and with little money, voy- aging to Italy, that eager-sought goal of genius-there'to bask amid the beauties of the old masters, whose hands seemed to beckon him on to fame and immortality.

The trio soon became excellent friends.      i Friendsl ahl Paul soon found that roguish love had donned the garb of sober friendship, and was playing strange antics in his heart, pushing aside, with matchless impudence, the grave old masters who had so long held their sway, and /giving up the key of every chamber to- the living presence of Beatrice! Many were the pleasant devices of the Champion's pas- sengers, by which life on ship-board was divested of its tedium. A daily paper was started, under the editorship of the clergyman, to which all. contributed, and much mirth and good humor did its pages promote.

These accessories, however, were not required by Bea- trice to speed the flight of time. There was to her a never-failing source of pleasure in the beauty of the sea; she found something new, something to abslch  -. 2: to suggest a topic for pleasant converse every time she : looked upon it.

She would then watch the stars peeping forth, one by one, timidly at first, as if afraid to show their lovely faces, while the westernlsky still bore the pomp of the sun's decline. And, as she yet looked upon them, the waves that aeaved and  swelled to the eastern horizon, became as molten silver and mingled with the radiant sky, then up from their bosom slowly arose the full orb'd moon in lovely majesty, and as she cleared the wave and rode triumphant on the heavens, Beatrice would gaze into that brilliant pathway tracked by her beams upon the heaving mass of waters,  and almost fancy that it led to heaven! The last week of their voyage Mrs. Woodville was prevailed upon to go on deck, and, much to the pleasure of the doctor and Beatrice, her fears soon vanished. True, the first time she stepped her foot above the companion-way, and cast her eyes upon the wide expanse, "water, water, every where," she clung to the doctor's arm, and begged him to take her back-" if she had got to be drowned,  she did not want to see the water," she said, but very soon she became more calm, and seeing so many people around her alive and merry, she concluded she might as well take her chance with the rest, so pulling out her knitting-work, she sat quietly under the awning, looking and :listening to all that was going on, and working herself up to a high state of sympathy for poor Jack, swinging so fearless aloft. And now the voyage was over. Bravely had the good ship borne them on their way across the trackless ocean, and with thankful hearts to Him who had'preserved them   TV'E FORSAKEN DAUGHTER. 129- from all the perils of the deep, they now drew near their destined port. Friendships had been formed now to be broken or       z weakened by separation. Hand had met hand in kindly pressure, which might never clasp again, and never more might that little band of voyagers meet, and when the Champion swung to her moorings, there was sadness in     i  the hearts of all.

OUR party from  D--, not having   any especial busi- ness to hurry them  on, passed a  day or two in Havre, very pleasantly rambling through its long, narrow streets, and visiting whatever places of interest their guide pointed out, feeling as every other traveler must feel, who, for the  i first time, touches a  foreign shore, where the language, dress and customs  of the inhabitants are so at variance with his own. To Mrs. Woodville this contrast was most striking in the clattering, wooden shoes of the women, and their short, full petticoats, the slippery, polished floors, whereon she placed her foot as cautiously as if she was about to trust her- self upon some icy pond-the strange men with woolen caps I   THE   FORASIAE N 'DA UGTEER  .  :13t  that could not speak English, and the funny little children who could speak French. Paul Saville still kept them company, his eagerness for Italia's "sunny skies" yielding to the influence of Bea- trice's sunny smile. Indeed, he had so insensibly attached himself to their party, that they began to look upon him as one of them, and the final result of this intimacy was an invitation from Dr. Woodville to join them en route for Florence, where they intended passing the winter. \ An invitation which, it is needless to say, was gratefully accepted.

Suffice it, their pleasure was not like those who go through such scenes, merely that they may have it to say, "I have been to the Louvre, vast affair that!" or, "I galloped through the Bois de Boulogne, fine shady trees there, 'pon honor, and I strolled along the Boulevardsrl"or, "I went to Pere le Chaise and touched with my own hand, the tomb of Abe. lard and Heloise--read-about themi the other day in Pope!" or, "I saw at Little Trianon the Swiss cottage of Marie Antoinette-shocking bore to cut off her head!" Not so did our travellers visit those scenes, but with hearts and minds alive to their beauty, and to the interest with which centuries had invested them. The intimate and close companionship which now united them, only deep.-  ened the interest which each felt in the other, and more than once did the doctor and Mrs. Wbodville congratulate themselves in having formed so agreeable an addition to their party as Paul; and as Beatrice, hanging ipon his arm, strolled with him through the shady walks of the Tuilleries, or in the broad gallery of the Louvre, her mind taking in more vividly the glorious impressions of art, as he pointed out with skillful appreciative eye their beau. ties, she would involuntarily ask herself if it was possible that- she could be so happy ifs she could be that Bea- trice, the once wretched wife, the stricken mother, the ma- niac!

He learned it too in the gentle whispers of the wind, amid the forest boughs, as if an angel there concealed its harp- strings swept, or in the terrors of the tempest, which rent the prpud oaks asunder.

I Ere the bright stars paled in the dawning, the farmer boy was called to his daily labors, which ceased not until the heavens were again studded with the gems of night. During the winter months, he, in common with other farmer lads, had the advantage of a district school, and these advantages he richly improved. , His eagerness for study attracted the attention of the village Pastor, who kindly devoted to him a few evening hours, and thus Paul, at sixteen, might have challenged competition with mlany a son of wealth. He was looked upon by his'less ambi- tious school-mates, as quite a miracle:  &amp; "And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, That one poor head corld carry all he knew!"

Together our friends have visited all those classic scenes, have viewed those glorious works of art, which but to name, makes one's heart thrill. Together they have stood by the tomb of Michael Angelo, and have gazed en. raptured upon the Fornarina, and the St. John of Raphael. Yet why recapitulate those sights and scenes, upon which, when the eye of the traveller rests, he finds ,his] most glowing anticipations more than realizedl We will not, therefore, dwell upon them. Paul Saville had now commenced his studies with all the enthusiasm which pervaded his early dreams, and, as his pencil traced lines of beauty upon the speaking can- vass, an atmosphere of love permeated his whole being, and he dared lift his eyes to the bright picture which hope placed before him of Beatrice and fame. To his excellent friend, Dr. Woodville, he had made known his early history-to him he had confided all his hopes and aspirations--no, not all-there was one secret which he jealously guarded from every eye-which he hardly dare whisper to himself, and which he could not profane by speaking aloud, viz: his love for Bea- trice! For how dare he, a poor artist, aspire to the hand of Miss Woodville I no, he must leave his love, un- spoken, until happily the time might come, when he would have it in his power to offer her a home not un- worthy, and yet not worthy her loveliness. Yet not so deeply hidden was this cherished secret, as to escape the penetrating eye of Dr. Woodville, who soon,   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.    139 casting a shrewd glance upon the other side, found that Beatrice tooh ad the like, secret, hidden snugly away in that little heart of hers. "Ah, ha!" said the doctor, shaking his head, "I must look to this!" So he sat down and began revolving the matter over in his mind pretty much in this way: "Why should'nt they be made happy, poor things! why should they be wearing out the best of their lives in a hopeless passion---it's all folly!" "Simply because poverty forbids the bannsl" quoth Prudence, sagely. 1  "Pooh, pooh, Miss Prudence, you reason pretty well, I acknowledge, but it won't holdl I have an argument which I think will do the business, answers the doctor, rubbing his hands. "Suppose I hand poverty a well filled purse, won't he take his. grim old pinched face out of the way-eh?'" "You I Dr. Ihabod Woodville youl why what is Paul Saville to you, or Beatrice,-that you should speak of money as if it was silk paper or brass buttons! put up your purse, doctor," said Prudence, tossing her head. At which the doctor coolly got up, and telling her to take herself off uickly, went totalk the matter over with his good lady.  "He is a fine fellow," said Mrs. Woodville.

That evening, Dr. Woodville, putting his arm through that of Saville, strolled with him beneath the lofty trees of the Casine. It was the sun-set hour: sun-set in Florence-how lovely I when the heavens and even the very air we breathe is glowing, bright, luxurious, and the sun, like a monarch, sinks to his rest curtained in brilliant , clouds of purple and goldl Nothing could be more charming than that spacious pleasure-ground, the Cascine, at such an hour!as this, with its deep, rich green sward on which those superb trees rest, the shady, retired groves, the little temples and grottos scattered here and there through the lovely openings, looking into shades so inviting, and the Arno mirroring in its placid flow the trees and shrubbery which wave over it. It was indeed most lovely, and yet if one may judge from the conversation which held thein long within its pleasant walks, both the doctor and Paul were exceeding. ly blind to all its claims upon their attention. ,. .

The young lover was taken by surprise-how could his secret have been betrayedl For a few moments he dared not trust himself to speak: "Pardon my presumption Dr. Woodville-yes, I ac- knowledge I do love your daughter. How could I so long have been permitted to enjoy her society, to be in such near and happy communion with her, and not feel my heart captive to her surpassing loveliness!

And then, hurrying to the steam- boat, ithe spire of old Trinity soon disappeared, as With swift paddle, the Lexington turned her bows toward N w Htaven.              I Again defeated I When Staunton reached D     , he found, to his chagrin, tha; Dr. Woodville had resigned the charge of  the Institution, and left the village. Dr. Morton could give him no information. He went through all the different wards, expressed the greatest interest in those unhappy beings, begged to see them all, and made the most particular inquiries of the keepers and nurses. He could obtain no satisfaction- they knew nothing of the person of whom he was in ; search, except Mrs. Boyd, and she, good old soul, kept her own secrets. By a most singular coincidence, as he passed through the gateway where his horse stood, impatiently pawing the earth, Old Sybil was, at that moment, coming up the road, walking slowly along close to the wall under the shade of the trees. She had reached the village only the night previous, whither she had been sent by Mrs. Lor- raine, to ascertain, if possible, some trace of Beatrice, r    ' '   THE  FORS'AKEN   DAUGHTER.     147, whose sudden disappearance from the Asylum seemed so strange and inexplicable. Seeing a gentleman coming through the gate and about to mount his horse, Sybil hastened her steps that she might ask him in which way she could best gain admit- tance within the walls. The recognition was mutual. One glance, and under that neat black methodist bonnet, Staunton detected Mrs. Lorraine's old nurse. "Ah, ha!" thought he, "now I have tracked the foxl yoicksl yes, Beatrice is here thenl this old woman has been sent on some message to her-ah-h ' infidel now I have yo u on the hip " "Hi', quoth old!

We will not dwell upon the rage of Staunton-2we could not, for it passed all bounds of speech of description. Convinced now, by the appearance of Sybil upon the spot, that Beatrice was still within those walls, he made use of every art to gPin access to her. He assumed as many shapes as Proteus, now as an old man--now as some foreigner anxious to visit the Institution. He hired persons to go there and pursue the search for him-but all would not do I Finally he gave it up, convinced she could not be there--where then? dead perhaps. It was the first time in his life that Staunton had ever relinquished a scheme of villainy-but this was from necessity, so he must be excused from any inconsistency.  His threats against Mrs. Lorraine he had never dared to carry out, because his own reputation was at stake, They often met in the gay saloons of fashion, yet met as perfect strangers, which the world seeing, shrugged its shoulders, looked knowing, and whispered, "Mrs. Lor- ! raineo and her lover have quarreled!"  New York suddenly became very distasteful to Staun- ton-like Sir Charles Coldstream, he found "nothing ill it." He had long rioted in every dissipation-he was } satiated.       .  Boston was too Puritan. Philadelphia too friendly. Well, thank heaven, London and Paris would be new!  he would try those untrod paths, and see if there was "any thing in them."

IT is not necessary to follow the career of Hubert Staunton through those cities of the old world-neither would it be agreeable-it would be quite as much so to trace the slimy trail of a viper. A lovely morning in October, found him in Florence, in company with friends who had traveled with him fromi Paris. They had passed several days in strolling around the city and its environs-had visited the Cathedral, the Church of Santa Croce and San Mare, and'had stood ad- miringly in those spacious galleries of art, when one morn. ing a gentleman whose acquaintance Staunton had lately formed, asked: "Have you been to Saville's Studio? if you have not, I assure you, there is pleasure in reserve for you. He is one of your countrymen too--a man of genius, and by the way, has the loveliest wife in all Florence." 9    <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6462-00000066"/> 152  THE  FORSAKEN     DAUUGHTER. "That last argument is irresistible," was the reply,- give me breathing beauty, and I turn even from your Venus de Medici! allons." So saying they left the hotel ;together and were soon introduced to the studio of Saville:  During the two years of his residence in Florence, Paul ; has been rapidly rising in his profession. Yes, genius has triumphedl he is already well known, admired, and pro- nounced by coninoisseurs, as the most promising artist of theday.

Suddenly Staunton paused:      J "Good heavens-what an astonishing likeness!" he ex- . 1 claimed.               i         1 It was a copy of Titians Bella before which he stood.  An exquisite thing, and as he intended it for himself alone, Saville, while he retained all the grace of attitude and ex- pression which that great artist had iimned, had stolen the lovely head and bust of Beatrice, to make the picture perfedt in his eyes. "Quite a gem--a beautiful thing!" said his compan- ion.  Staunton was nearly as white as marble-that sweet    face, what reminiscences did it not recall I      X 1             '           X   THE  FORSAKEN'   DAUGHTER.      153 "The resemblance is most wonderful 1" he at length found words to say.  Excuse me Mr. Saville, but will you tell me whether that fair face is a mere copy, or is it a portrait?" "The painting, in its details, is, as you see, from Titian; the face, however, I painted to suit myself. It is the por- trait of a lady to whom I shall be happy to introduce you, if you will dine with me to day. It is the portrait of my wife, Mr. Staunton." Little did Saville imagine, that the person before him, to whom he was thus tendering the rites of hospitality, was identical with him who had been the relentless persecutor of his beloved Beatrice! "I shall be most happy to accept your invitation,"- answered Staunton. This face reminds me paipfully of S a beautiful girl I once knew, but as all else that is bright and lovely fades the soonest, she too now sleeps in the grave I Should Mrs. Saville bear as striking a resemblance to that dear girl as this sweet picture, I shall feel that I have found a long 1dst friend!"

Entering the drawing-room, with all that graceful ease and suavity of manner which he could soi well affect, he advanced to meet Saville, who came courteously forward to welcome his guest, and then taking him by the arm led him across the room, and presented him to,  "Dr. Woodvillej Mr. Staunton."  Had a thunder-bolt riven the very spot where he stood, he could not have been more astounded I Dr. Woodville,  i too, recognized his quondam visitor, and the bow with  - which he met the introduction, was exceedingly formal.  " There was no retreat, so, putting a bold face upon the matter, Staunton exclaimed:               isi "Ah, Dr. Woodville I I have had the pleasure of meet i  ing you before, I am happy to renew my acquaintance, my  dear sirl it is delightful to meet a friend in a foreign I land  . " "And very disagreeable to meet a person we despise,  I Mr. Staunton," returned the doctor, with emphasis.    e "Exactlr so-all sorts of people will travel, and we are just as likely to meet a foe as a friend, doctor. Florence i is a charming spot-have you visited the Hospital St. Bonefacio?" replied Staunton with consummate effrontery. "Have you friends there too?" inquired the doctor sar-  castically.  Staunton understood the taunt, but had the prudence to hold his peace. He crossed the room, and placing him- self at the window looked down upon the placid waters of the Arno.

He now returned with her leaning upon his arm-their entrance being unperceived by Staunton,*who, occupied with-his own bitter fancies, still stood looking from the window. "Beatrice," said the doctor in a low voice,--' have courage-Paul be calm I That man is Hubert Staunton. Don't be alarmed my child, you have nothing to fear, re- member you have now a protector-a husband, Beatrice, -courage!" For a moment the color faded from her cheek, her step faltered, and she leaned heavily upon the arm of her hus- band,-yet the doctor's words reassured her, and the ten- derness with which Paul drew her to him, as he passed his arm around her waist to support her, restored her to her- welf. $ As Staunton turned from the window, it was with per- feet self-possession that she awaited his approach.

You would not know her, Beatrice I mean, so radiant in her matured charms--so gloriously beautifull You well remember what power her young, budding loveliness exerted over my heart, binding me a willing captive, satiated as I was, perhaps, with other and older beauties I she was so fresh, where others were so faded--so naive, where others were so artificial--so innocent, where others were so artful-so perfectly unconscious of her beauty, where *t": others were so vain! Have you ever seen that ex. quisite picture of Modesty and Vanity? you have, per- haps, a recollection of my charming Beatrice's coun- tenance, which will answer admirably to that of Modesty --while for Vanity, commend me, madam, to your mirror - -you have a fine one!

From those we love, it is a bitter drop in our cup of happiness, however full, and to part with them when the cup we have to drink is dregged with sorrow, is more bitter still I We cannot say a careless adieu to afriend at any moment, we are always sorry to watch their retreating forms, or ourselves going,-to turn back to some pleasant window, and see there kind faces watching our de- departing footsteps I But when we are about to separate from our dearest and best friends for a long time, perhaps for years, and in the uncertainty of all human life, it may be never to meet again-then " the heart knoweth its own bitterness."       !

The skies of Italy were fair, but the skies of America were fairer I They had postponed their departure from time to time, only from their reluctance to part with their dear children, for such they seemed, until at length letters from home rendered it i peratively necessary that their return should be delayed no longer.  Their last day in Florence was a sad one. Never had the sun shone down upon a more lovely landscape, rich   with the relics of ages, than that viewed from their win. " dows. Never had the atmosphere been more voluptuous or rife with the odors of that delicious clime, yet to those so soon to leave them, all things were draped in funeral gloom. And yet it was pleasant to see how each one strove to hide their sorrow from the other-how they busied themselves about little trifling matters, how they dwelt with such pertinacity tipon every subject not connected with the- morrow. , Cheerfulness knocked very hard to be admitted-her shadow only passed in.

There have been such partings, however, both before and since, when' a bunch of flowers has been. a fragrant gift to memory. We have all may-be taken a leaf, a bud, a twig from some cherished spot-perhaps from the sod that lies cold upon the faces of those we have loved--we put it away among our little treasures, and by and by, in goma unexpected moment we come upon it--tell me, are there written' words, or dotted lines can speak to us in more thrilling tones than those dry withered leaves I d;   Paul and Beatrice accompaniied -thi, dear friends to Havre, that they might be with them to the last, and went i . with them also on board the packet-ship the morning she was to sail. iNo sooner did Mrs. Woodville attempt to go below than she was seized with one of her old fits of nervous- I ness: "Dear, dear, how can I ever go down into that little ' cabin, and climb into one of those horrid berthsl I de- cdare I had rather not go .home at alll and then I shan't have you Beatrice to nurse me," she cried, disconsolately, as she sat down upon a cqoil of ropes,-"I shan't have you dear girjl to comfort me, and fix up my pillows, and hold my head!"

The doctor laughed a real genuine hearty laugh: "I am sure, my dear wife, I must have looked very sor- rowful and sympathizing." "You tried to do so, I dare say-but I could see a smile lurking round the corners of your mouth, and a twinkle of the eye, that I understood well enough,--and then, there was Beatrice,"---- "Well, what did Beatrice do?" "I saw her more than once turn awayjher head and smile, indeed I did l" "Only when you would sometimes beg us to throw you overboard "-said Beatrice laughing,-" for then I could not help thinking how comical you would look bobbing up and down upon the waves, with your head all bound in a red handkerchief, and that gay flowered dressing- gown floating about you, like some great sea-bird with its v ings all spread!"

The roof has turned gray, and the green moss and lichen peep from the warped shingles-the house has donned a more sober garb, as becomes one who notes gravely the changes which are going on. The timbers which support the little porch are dingy and weather-riven, land the floor complains at the slightest ! touch. The barn begins to stoop and grumble 'under its burthens, and the corn-crib maliciously scatters the golden l!   TEE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     167 ears committed to its charge. Yet, while decay has thus been stealing silently on, beauty and strength have ifol. lowed close, for the tender saplings have shot up into graceful trees, the kernals which the farmerplanted, now yield their luscious fruit, and the sweet-briar has climbed and climbed, until now it is creeping along the eaves as if determined to view what is passing upon the other side of that great barrier which has always been such an obstacle to her seeing the world. Upon the old oaks alone the hand of time has neither laid decay, nor added beauty, :I.

Other children, too, are playing around the porch and tumbling upon the green sward-children not brought in coaches either, with bank notes in their hands, as the farmer would say, but with stout, wooden spoons to dive into the porridge-pot, and with these rapidly increasing mouths opening like young robins and craving food, there has come harder toil, more privations. The farmer looks worn, there are wrinkles on his brow, and his shoulders show the yoke of labor, while Mrs. Leslie, al- thoe' she steps briskly and sings cheerily, yet the silver threads mingle with her dark brown hair, and her brow wears ;an anxious, troubled look--there are lines upon it left by midnight toil, and watches,\with her sick little ones. With Bessie, now a stout, handsome child of twelve years, Amy shares the charge of the younger children, and also the other labors which naturally devolve upon the eldest of a family-a farmer's family especially.  . . .  0    <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6462-00000074"/> 368  THE  rORSAKEN    DAUG  TER. That human nature is prone to selfishness, the most un- selfish cannot with truth deny-the purest metal has its alloy, and the purest heart may still have some grain of baser matter. And, although Mrs. Leslie would have shrank froml committing any act of unkindness toward her, yet there were tasks and duties given Amy to perform, which she would have hesitated to impose upon her own children. And yet she loved her little protege nearly as well as l she did Bessie, and never regretted making any personal sacrifice for her sake. Not so her husband. So, long as Amy was the only baby, he loved her and petted her, she was a winning, little creature, and, one must possess a less tractable heart than the farmer, not to be won by the sweet smile of an infant! But when I others came, one by one, to fill her place, he began to shut his heart against the little girl. For several years the promised funds for her support had not been remitted, and the farmer, at length, began to grumble audibly. He did not consider that, ere long, even his selfishness would be satisfied with the labor of her hands, that she would soon become a help, and not a burthen! no, he could not look to any future contingency-he could only see her as she was now, a mere helpless, little child, eating the bread and wearing the clothes which, by right, belonged to his own children. Farmer Leshe was not a bad man either. He had kindly feelings, and would have resented any injustice to Amy elseuwhere, as if she had been really his child. Strange inconsistency! when the children were at their sports, romping about the fields, or hunting hen's nests in   ,THE    FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER  .  169 the old-barn, tumbling ovei the fragrant hav, he could not tell Why--but the laugh of Amy, thoe sweet as the carol of a bird, was discordant to his ear: and again, when he would find her idling round, as all little girls will sometimes do, but busy with her own little thoughts, he would say:          '   c "Here, Amy, why don't you go into the garden and weed the onions?" or,  - "Run to the barn and shell some corn for the fowls- quick, I tell you, I won't have any drones about my hive!"I : The cheerful, happy tempered child did not notice any unkindneAs, but thought her father the very best any little girl ever had, and, if sometimes a harsh word, may-be a blow, would bring a tear to her eye, or a pout to her lip, for Amy could pout and shrug her little brown shoulders as well as any other little girl of her age, yet it was quick- ly forgotten, and from tears sprang a smile as bright as the sun upon the dew-lipped clover. Her old friend, Harry Gorden, left Auburn when Amy was but five years old. A farmer's life had become irk- somq to him. Without any prospect of being able to own a farm for many years, it seemed to him that he was a "mere hewer of wood and drawer of water" for other people. He made up his mind it would not do. He was willing to work; but he wanted to realize something more from: it than the pleasures of sight-viz: to see the bil- lowy grain which he had scattered ripening for others, or the grass he had swathed, feed other men's cattle I no, no, that would not answer. So he made his way to the great metropolis, where he was now a clerk, with--golden tem- ples in cloud'land, and vast "Castl(?s in Spa'n."    <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6462-00000075"/> 170  THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER. Every sumrmar Harry came back to the old spot, and never without some little gift for Amy--a doll, a book, or a paper of sugar-plums, which Amy always shared with her little sisters, She believed herself, of course, the child of farmer Leslie-no one had ever hinted otherwise, and Mrs. Leslie I would have highly resented any interference with their secret-Amy was her child, she said, just as much as any. body's child! Bessie could but just remember how as- tonished she was one day, when she came in from play, to see her mother sitting there with a dear, little, cunning baby in her lap-but then, babies always made their ap. pearance so mysteriously-she was just as much surprised, she said, when, one morning, her mother called her to the bed-side, and she saw Lucy's funny, little head snug gled down close to her, and another time, too, when her father led her to the cradle, and there, of all things in thb world, was a little tiny, boy baby-little Johnny,--so Amy's , ad-vent was no greater mystery than that of the other children. There was very little resemblance between Amy and her sisters and her little brother. They were stout, ruddy Children, with very white hair, and large, blue eyes, fine looking, active, and gave promise of strong help to their parents when they should be going down the vale of years. I Amy's hair was black as the raven's wing, and formed a perfect little nest of ringlets, tight and crisp, setting upon her finelyshaped head. Her eyes were a soft, dewy ' black, of a peculiar oval shape, deep set, and shaded by long, curling lashes,-her nose was a little retroussee, or, to expose it; without this delicate French covering, I must   [  I! THE  FORSAKEN   DAUGHTER.     171 say it was, in truth, a turn-up nose, but which gave an arch expression to her face, increased by two little dim- ples lurking at the corners of her full, ruddy lips. Her complexion was rich, not dark, nor yet light, there was a warm tint about it which painters love to catch-'only she would get terribly sun-burned  She was even now taller at nine years of age than Bes- sie. She was no fragile tender plant either, but as strong and healthy a young twig as one [would like to see. She had a nice little temper of her own too. She was no lamb- p like, meek child, that would have her hair pulled by a play-mate, without a slap back with her little hand, br have her play-things snatched away, without a struggle- it was snatch and snatch. Amy was generous too and forgiving, she would almost run her little feet off to serve' t any one, and with a happy smile, would give up any little luxury, if she saw Lucy or Johnny looking with wistful eyes-but they must not attempt to take it from herl no indeed-then my lady stood up for her rights. She was always going around hunting up motherless chickens, and lame goslings, picking up stray little duck- lings, wrapping them up in soft wool, and tucking them away in all sorts of odd places-took little kittens that had been sent to try the water cure, and hid them under the barn, or would sometime astonish the old cat, by bringing back her whole brood, after she had been aily seeking the "tuneful nine,"-refusing to be comforted even by a sauoer of mik. She was a friend to little pigs, and devoted to lambs, and would plead as eloquently for the life of a doomed calf, as an able lawyer for-that of a fellow-being. Mrs. Leshe had taught Bessie and Amy their letters at her leisure moments, which knowledge, they, ia turn, im-    <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6462-00000076"/> 172  THE  FORSAKEN   DAUGHTER. parted to the younger children. But Amy soon out-strip, Fed Bessie. She mastered ,old Webster's spelling-book word for word, and was extremely proud when, gathering  the children about her, she could read to them that very -UR interesting tale of the milk-maid and her chickens, or the / story of the naughty boy up in the apple-tree, upon whom X "the virtue of stones," was about to be exemplified: she could repeat too with great pathos, suiting the action to the word, "yes little nest I hold you fast!" he had picked up a little geographical. knowledge from an old torn coverless school-book, which Mrs. Leshe had thumbed in her younger days, and she had the multiplication table perfect. So far her education went and no further. The Bible and the Hymn Book she especially reve- renced. These two sacred volumes had always rested upon the same little candle-stand, in the same little corner, ever since she could remember, and the child always walked more softly when she drew near it, and looked upon it with a stilly awe she could not understand. When she was a very little girl her mother would sometimes show ler the pictures of Mary and the blessed Babe, of Joseph flying with the young childclinto Egypt, or of Daniel in the Lions Den, and so on through the sacred volume, and when she had learned to read, Mrs. Leslie would allow her and Bessie to hold the book in their lads, and read it aloud. And this beqame her greatest pleasure--no task so difficult but was cheerfully accomplished, if she might be allowed to read afewpages in the sacred Book. Chap- ter after chapter, and verse after verse she committed to memory, and would go about repeating them softly to herself, and she had a habit too of applying them with sin- gullar aptness, as if they sprang involuntarily to her lips   HE  FORSA KEN   DAUGATER.     173 She learned many little hymns too, and catching the airs from her mother would sing them very sweetly, as she sat upon the old worn door-step some 'calm summer night.

It was one of those lovely days which follow in the path of the autumn king, when a soft transparency floats over the face of the landscape, subduing the gorgeous drapery of the woods to more mellow tints, and filling the air with that ' dreamy and magical light" which our poet Longfel- low has so beautifully depicted.

A happy party of little children left the old farm-house that morning for the woods. The chestnuts were ripe. The frost had opened the prickly burrs, and the brown glossy kernels strewed the ground. This was always a joyous event, and when, the night before, the farmer told his children, that on the mor- row they could go to the chestnut-wqods half a mile dis- tant from the farm, they could scarcely sleep, so anxious were they for the dawn of day. Breakfast over, they set forth, each provided with a little basket or pail. Their nimble feet soon put distance behind, and by nine o'clock they had reached the grove, when one universal shout of gladness awoke the " dreamy air," and rang through the old trees, as the children saw the bountiful harvest spread around them. And now, where to commence the forage, was matter of grave de- bate. Here the nuts were in heaps, and still pelting down from the topmost boughs, and there; "O come here "Bessie would cry, -"I have found such a nice spotl" and -away they would all scamper for it, yet erve half-way there, Amy would call: "Come back-come back-0, Bessie do see the nutsl" At length concluding to divide their forces, where there was so much to be gleaned, Amy and Lucy began filling their baskets at "the very best spot," while Bessie with little Johnny were picking up the nuts at another "very best spotl" and many a shout of child-like glee rang through the woods that dayl    <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6462-00000078"/> 176  THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER. Filled soon and heaped high were the baskets and pails, and then the children sat down upon the sunny banks, or upon the trunks of fallen trees, and divided their dinners, which they had brought with them, scooping up the water in their hands from the little brook which gurgled over the stones, half hidden in the russet leaves of autumn, or stooping down lave their rosy lips in the sparkling stream. Then they sang their little songs over and over again, they laughed until echo laughed with them, they played hide and seek behind the logs, or in and out among the trees- hand in hand they danced around the moss-grown trunks until Amy suddenly starting up, declared it was time to bo - going, for mother said they must be hon e before sun-set, and she could already see his great red face going downthe west. So, hastily gathering together their baskets, the merry children shouted "good bye " to the old woods, and started for home.

With childish curiosity the children turned their eyes upon her, while the old woman herself seemed to be eyeing them as curiously.  Yet to their surprise the face upon which they looked was that of a colored person, perhaps some fifty years of age. This was a very unusual sight, for at the time, but few of the colored race had found their way to the west, and those few were old family servants, who preferred emi i    THE  FORSAKEN    D A U GH T ER.  17  1 grating with their masters and mistresses from the Eastern States. Bessie and Amy had once or twice met with them when they rode over to Auburn with their father and mother, but to the others, the sight was not only novel, but terTi- fying. Little Johnny clung tightly to Amy's dress, and began to cry lustily, while Lucy hid herself away behind Bessie, and only dared to peep out one eye in wonder at the strange black woman. "Why massy sake," said the old woman, with a long silent laugh," why what de child so scare for! nebber seen old nig' afore? hi-look here little massa, I got someting for de little boys when dey don't ICry," and putting her hand into her pocket, she drew forth an orange, and then with another dive, up came a handful of raisins,-"' hi', dems de nice tings for little boys, and little gal too-here Missy," as she handed some to Amy, "and now dat pretty little-Missy must hab some, and little scared gal too!" and so saying she distributed her gifts freely among the astonished children, pulling forth raisins and figs from the "vasty deep" of her pockets, until they almost believed they had found the Good Fairy their mother sometimes told them about in her stories.! Even frightenedJohnny, soon forgot to cry, and took the orange in his little hand, quite reconciled to his fate: "Bery nice little childrenl where be you gwine, eh?' asked the sold woman, always with her eyes fixed upon Amy.

"What did you say?" asked Amy, for the old woman had spoken very low, as if to herself. "Noting at all, child, only jus ask what you'se name- dat's aUll " "Amy Leslie." The old woman nodded her head and smiled to herself "Well, little children, I guess I'd better be gwine-it's getting kinder late, won't you walk 'long de road jus a little bit, it's lonesome, you better believe!" Amy glanced at the sun, it was almost down, yet thinking they should oblige the old woman by going a little way with her, the children turned and retraoed their steps in the direction of the grove.  They had not-gone far, when she turned off the main rbad into a narrow lane, thickly shaded by trees, where, to the surprise of the children, a carriage was drawn up on one side of the path, for it could scarcely be called a road. At the sound of their childish voices, a lady put her head out of the window, and gazed long and earnestly upon the children, then- hastily drawing down her veil, sank back in the carriage.  "I 'spect dat lady, mebbe, like some of dese nuts -jus you come 'long me, little missy, and you stay here nice little boy; cause p'raps de lady wouldn't like so many little children t'woncel" and Amy, following the old woman, bashfully advanced to the carriage, holding up her little basket. Her sun-bonnet had fallen off upon her shoulders, thus revealing her bright, handsome face, with her eyes lifted to the vailed features of the lady, with a beautiful, half-timid expression which gave them a peculiar softness. ,'    ;     !   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     179 The woman went up close to the window and spoke a few words to the lady in a very low voice,then turning to the child, she said: "Jus git into the carriage, little missy, just a minit, child, case de lady wants to kiss you, you is sich a pretty, little gall"  Amy hesitated a moment. It seemed singular, even to her artless mind, that the lady should want her to get into the carriage-yet rather pleased, too, at-4e compli- ment, she went round the other side, and blushing, sprang lightly in. Sybil followed, (she has been already recog nized by the reader,) and ere Amy had time to think, the driver applied hi, lash to the horses, they bounded for- ward, the carriage rolled rapidly out of the lane into the main-road, and then swiftly bowled along over the turnpike. Surprise for a moment kept the child silent, then rising, and pouring the half nearly of her chestnuts into the lady's lap, she said: "Please let me get out now, I want to get out." "Only jus sit still, little minit, don't you lub to ride in such a nice coach, eh, little missy?" "Yes, I suppose it's very nice, only I had rather go back now I Bessie and the children will be waiting there A11 this time, won't you please, ma'am, tell the man to stop his horses and let me get out?" This last appeal she addressed to the lady. "Not Jet, soon,' was the answer, but the voice trembled and sounded hollow. After waiting patiently for a few moments, Amy again said: zz ^ r,- -              - ' , . . .  *    <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6462-00000080"/> 180  THE  FORSAKE N   DAUGHTEtR.

"No, child-I am going to take you home with me," answered the lady, "so sit still."  7 "Do you live far? will it take long? for I want to go home," Amy said, almost sobbing.  "Yes, I live many nmiles from here, and it will take a great while to get there. I am going to take you home to live with me, so don't tease any more, my head aches."  Amy began to be frightened, her breath came thick as she said: "But I don't want to go home with you, if you please, ma'am, I want to get out now, I want to go to my own home l" No answer was made, and still the carriage rolled rapidly on. Amy saw the sun was setting, and she knew from the rapidity with which they had come, that she must be two or three miles from home, she began to get desperate as she thought of Bessie and the children, and what her mother would say: "Oh, do let me go this minute-won't you take me back? pray, pray open the door, won:t you please?" and, seizing the knob, she began to jerk and twist it vio- lently. Mrs. Lorraine now threw up her veil, and probably to intimidate the child, fixed her large, piercing eyes upon her face, and said, sternly: ' "Let go the door, do you hear, litt girl-and sit still. It will do no good to cry, you are going with me!" That tone of command roused Miss Amy's temper in a moment--I have said she was no lamb. That cold, stern   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.    1Sf eye had no intimidating effect upon her, but throwing back her little head like ayoung princess, her eyes flashing, and the color mantling her temples, she said: "I tell you, I will get out, and I won't go home with you! I don't like you, and now, if you don't let me get out, I'll scream, yes I'll scream just as hard as ever I can -so therei" Old Sybil laughed another silent laugh: "De lor, Misses Anne, 'if I shant jump right off de han- dle jus hear dat child-hi! it somehow makes dis ole heart glad!" Amy behaved very fairly. She gave her enemies time to consider her terms, but finding they were not to be complied with, she prepared for action accordingly- planting both her little hands upon her hips as if to sus- tain her efforts, she opened hr mouth to lits full extent, and deliberately sent forth three long, shrill screamsl Old Sybil clapped her hands to her ears: "Y-ah, y-ah, bless de Lord, what's all dis! hi--I be- lieve my ole head split!" Mrs. Lorraine seizing Amy by her shoulder shook her' violently, "Now stop, you bad girl-do you hear me-- stop!" "Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thingl" cried Amy, with flashing eyes, the verse ap- parently shaken into her mind by this rough treatment- "for I wont stop-there-now I'll scream again like any thing-there!" and another, even more shrill, issued from her lips. "Tie a handkerchief quickly over that child's mouth, Sybil--here is my scarf, I will see, Miss, if you will not stop!" and, after a great struggle, in which Amy bore her  <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6462-00000081"/> 182  THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER. part bravely, making her little hands and feet fly in every direction, she was finally obliged to surrender--her hands were boundl and a handkerchief tied Itightly over her mouth, yet even then by all sorts of defiant gestures with her head, and stamping with her feet, the child endeavored to atone for the robbery of her voice. Still the carriage rolled swiftly on. They had long since left the turnpike, and were now upon a narrow; cross road. Amy's belligerent powers finally exhausted themselves. She now thought of home, of her dear mother, of her sisters and little Johnny, and of what they would say when she did not come back all night I and then she began to weep and moan piteously. At length her little frame was exhausted, and sobbing, and grieving, poor little Amy finally fell asleep. Then Sybil removed the handkerchief from her mouth, untied her hands, and putting back the moist curls from her brow, rested her head quietly upon her bosom. "Poor little child, how she do sob and take on I 'clare to goodness, Misses Anne, I feel mighty bad about herl" said Sybil, the tears standing in her honest eyes. Mrs. Lorraine made no answer, but continued looking upon the sleeping child, as if studying every lineament of that little, troubled face. Sometimes her brow would contract, as if a sudden spasm racked her frame, then an expression of tenderness would steal over her features, and more than once, the tears sprang to, her eyes, altho' she hastily averted them, lest Sybil should detect her emotion. At length, turning to the old nurse, she said vith affected carelessness: "Sybil, do you--do you see any likeness?"   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     183 Shae had apparently been expecting some question of he kind, and now replied with great emphasis. "Likeness i why you had better believe, Misses Anne, t nebber see sich a likeness, nebber I why I 'clare to de Lord, de berry minit I see her coming 'long de road wid her little basket,--dere it be down in de corner, and all de nuts skeltering 'round de carriage, poor little gall dat bery minit I say to myself, 'dere Sybil, What you ole heart say? don't it say dat's you'se little li sses Beatrice's baby!' likeness I why she do look 'zactly like you, Misses Anne, and more too "  "Like me, Sybil, did you say?"

"Hush, Sybil " interrupted Mrs. Lorraine, sharply. ' Beg pardon, Misses Anne, but her nose han't got noting to do wid de Lorraine toses, dat's the fact'" an- swered Sybil. "She must have a very bad temper, tho'; I suppose, she has always had her way with those people!" said Mrs. Lorraine. "Well, it was kindob natrel dat she wanted to go back. Hi! I 'spect dey will feel drefful bad over dere!" "Nonsense, Sybil! they will, probably be glad to get rid of her. By the way, what did you do with the money?"

"Children's hearts are not so easily broken, Sybil; this child is like all others-fine dresses, and a nursery full of toys will soon console her. In a week she will cease to -think- of these people." "Mebbe she will, and mebbe she won't!" was Sybil's answer. 1,   1    -        '         i   -THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.    185 CHAPTER XX. !"But to think is to be full of sorrow And leaden-eyed despair 1"   EKBATa   SOON after dark they reached a small log tavern which seemed to invite the weary traveller to repose, ere enter- ing the long stretch of woods, upon the borders of which this humble tenement hung out its sign of welcome. Apparently their arrival was expected, for, as the car- riage drew up to the door, mine host was there to let down the steps, remarking, at the same time, that "supper was e'en a most ready to put on the tablle.' Amy, poor child, still slept, and Mrs. Lorraine now wrapping a large shawl closely around her, as if to con- "eal her humble garb from the eyes of .the inn-keeper, e-  quested him to carry her into the house. Lifted carefully in his arms, the little girl was then borne into a small room adjoining the kitchen, and placed upon the bed, Mrs. Lorraine and Sybil following. As soon as they were alone, the latter took from her pocket a key, and unlocking a travelling trunk which  <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6462-00000083"/> 186  TH E  FORS A K E N  D A U G HTER. stood' at the foot of the bed, proceeded to take from it and arrange the various articles of a little girl's wardrobe -a X  pretty dress of dark silk, a little mering shawl, snowy stockings, and pretty little boots, and then drew forth from a small box, a neat straw bonnet li#6ed and trimmed with green. "Dere, Misses Anne, won't she I look like a picter in dese pretty clothes?" she said, laying each piece upon ai chair by the bed-side.  "Let the child sleep, Sybil," answered her mistress, "I have concluded to remain here until morning, if I can be made comfortable. Don't leave her for a moment, for if sie should awake she will try in some way to escape. I will go and ascertain if we can all be lodged here." Sybil stood over the sleeping child, and as heavy sighs would now and then burst from her little grieved heart, the tears rolled down the cheeks of the faithful old nurse: "Poor little lamb!" she said, stroking her curls. "Well I dun no,'pears as if I wished she as back 'long of dem little children, dere she was jus like a bird singing in de woods all de day long, and now she' gwine to be shut up in a cage, poor gall well, I knows ode ting, Sybil will lub her and be good to her, dat she will " Mrs. Lorraine soon returned, and telling Sybil that she would now remain with the child, bade her go out and get some supper, and nothing loth tie old nurse obeyed. The door closed and Mrs. Lorraine was alone with her grand-child, that innocent child, of whom she had robbed her only daughter, froT whose unc nscious arms she had torn her, unpitying, and left a helpldss infant to the tender mercies of strangers, and who now lay before her the vic- tim of another great wrong for had she not rudely   jl    ITHE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     187  snatched her from the only hearts that loved her, from those wnom she considered as her parents, from her little playmates, and from the only home she had ever- known-- and for what?

The moon broke through! the branches'of the large trees which waved across the window and streamed full upon the bed, and upon the white sanded floor in fantastic shadows, and as the wind swayed the nearly leafless. boughs to and fro, they tapped startlingly against the narrow panes.

X The children had waited long ind patiently by the  roads'ide, expecting every momen. to see her return, They supposed the lady was only giving Amy a little ride to please her, and Bessie felt half envious of her sis-' ter's superior luck, for she thought it must be so much  more delightful to ride in a handsome carriage, than in fa-  ther's jolting one-horse wagon!  "I think I ought to have gone I'm sure, for I am the oldest!" she said pettishly, "and me ought to go too, for me's the youngest 1" added little Johnny, taking his mouth from the vent which he had made in his orange.

Mrs. Leslie stood at the gate anxiously looking for them. Some how or other she said, she had felt uneasy about them all day, and now as the sun had set, and the twilight deepening, she was sure something must have happened. Still they came not, and the poor woman was almost as frantic as the mother of Hood's -"Lost Heir:" " This way and that she wildly ran. O Lord! O dear, my heart will break, I shall go stick, stark, staring- wild! * Has ever a one seen any thing about the streets like a lost looking child!"

The children, too now seeing their mother - weep, all began to scream and cry, Johnny declaring withb sobs, and shaking his little fist, that the old black woman had taken poor sister Amy off into the woods to eat  her up!                 .

"It won't do any good, no, no, we shall never see her again, Gabriel l" continued Mrs. Leslie, rocking herself back and forth, Oh, Amy, I did'nt think when you went off this morning,'I should never see your dear little face again! Oh, Amy, Amyl Well, I must say," she cried, suddenly starting up and bustling about to get the children their supper, "I must say, she is no lady-a proud good for nothing creature, I'll warrant! why did'nt she come for her, like a decent respectable woman, and tell me she was much obliged to me for what I had done-not that I want any thanks, no, indeedl for it was always!a pleasure to do for Amy, ever since I had her --but to come sneaking about the place and steal her away just as they do the poor niggers, she ought to be ashamed l and then I'll bet any thing she'll whip her, and scold her, and,--Oh, I should like to catch her at at, I should-if she does, I'll--oh, dear, what will Harry Gordon say, I should like to, know!

Her love for'HEibert Staunton, gave place to scorn as bitter as love had been-trusting and sincere. It must be remembered, that Mrs. Lorraine at the time when Hubert Staunton first pleaded for, and won her af- fections, had seen her fortieth year-a time of life when a woman of sense does not expect to receive the adulteory professions of a lover. She may be still admired for well preserved charms-(that very expression " well preserved" has in it a smack of candied fruit, the freshness and fragrance gone,)-she may be admired for her grace of manner; for a cultivated mind, or a pleasant gift of speech, which Shak- speare declares to be an excellent thing in woman I These are charms which become all: yet she does not expect to bring to her feet the young, the gay, or elegant man of, fashion, or that he will pass by fair and lovely forms 'M youthful beauty, to lay upon her altar of forty summers the homage of true and passionate lovel ' Even Mrs. Lorraine, vain as she was of her Charms, did not expect this.

How much the more terrible then her Awakening from this sorcerous dream! Therefore, when false to his professions, insolently tri-  umphing in her love, Staunton stood forth the villain he  was, boasting of his perjured vows, and proclaiming her  the proud loving woman--as but the dupe and slave of his  artifice, then from her heart love died out as a flower is said to wither under the deadly exhalations of the Upas.

What had Mrs. Lorraine to love? Nothing. Even her sdlf-love had grown less as she saw her personal    X charms fading.                        I At length her thoughts reverted&amp; to the little infant, which, nine years before, she had left to the tender mer- T cies of strangers, or to their cruelty, she then cared not ! which. Did she still live? These thoughts for weeks passed through her mind without arranging themselves    i into any definite form or object. 'Then suddenly came the resolution to ascertain this fact, and, if living, to bring ! her home,-and what then? In another week the "what     I: then?" was defined.  She would adopt this deserted grand-child. She would   i make her will at once, and bequeath to .her all her pro- perty, lest in the event of her own sudden death, Beatrice might claim it! Yes, this child should be her heir-she   : was her own flesh and blood too-had never known her     ( mother. She could mould her as she pleased.; Only one condition would she assign to this will, viz-that should the child ever discover the secret of her birth, and there- by wish to hold any intercourse with her mother, or give to her even a dollar of her fortune to save her, perhaps, from starvation, then she was to fo:feit the wholel and without any reserve, the estate was to be shared equally by the charitable institutions of the city. This resolution formed, she hastened to put it into execution. Indeed, she could scarcely wait to ascertain whether the child still lived, ere she sent for her lawyer to draw up her will.  Again the faithful old nurse was taken into the confi- dence of her mistress. The plan was to proceed to Auburn, from thence Sybil was to visit the farm as a weary foot traveller, and seek a fl        I      .   THE  FORSAKEN DAUGHTER.         205 shelter for the night. She could then easily discover if the child was there, she would recognize her at a glance, Mrs. Lorraine assured her, declaring with a toss of her head, that her grand-child could, of course, have nothing in common with the coarse featured children of a laborer. If the little girl was there, then Sybil was to entice her from the house--hermistress to be waiting in the vicinity, and thus bear off her heiress. She was more fortunate than she expected. She had brought Sybil, in her carriage, within a quarter of a mile of Leslie Farm, and was about to return to the inn, when the gay, happy laughter of the children issuing fom the woods, attracted her notice: Somethingseemed to whisper her errand done. So, directing the coachman to draw up the carriage within the little lane, Sybil went forward to reconnoitre. No sooner did her eyes rest upon poor little Amy, so unconscious of her fate, than she recognized at once the family traits, for ' 'cept de nose," as she said, the child was a true Lorraine., The result is known.

I;ITTLE  Amy sat perfectly quiet In one corner of the  carnriage, as it made its tedious way over the road, scarcely raising her eyes or appearing to not'ce any thing around  her. Indeed Sybil thought she must be asleep, until,  peering under the little straw bonnet to ascertain, she found those soft eyes downcast and swimming in tears, altho' not one drop fell from their drooping lids.    ; Poor little Amy's heart was full, so were her thoughts.  She felt very sad. Why had she been taken away from her dear home I and would she ever see them again,-her dear father and mother, and Bessie, and Lucy, and little Johnnyl she wondered if they felt as bad as she did, if  they cried when she did not come back, and what father  X and mother said, and if mother did not think the children  had a great heap of chestnuts, and if she gave them the slice of ginger-bread she, promised them I And then, when she looked down  upon her silk dress, and saw a little I . . !

"I am nine years old l" replied Amy, throwing back her head as if pride had been a little touched. "I did not ask your age," said Mrs. Lorraine, "I asked you if you could read." "I can -read the Bible and the Hymn Book, and mother says I can never read any better books " was Amy's reply.  "De Lord bless de child " cried Sybil, patting her knee. "Don't say any thing more about your mother, Amy you must look upon me now as your mother!" said Mrs. Lorraine, in a tone which she meant for a kind one. And Amy did look upon her. She opened 1her eyes very wide, and took a deliberate survey of Mrs. Lorraine's countenance, then turned her head to 'the window. "Well; what are you staring at me 'so for?" was the impatient demand. "Nothing, ma'm, only, if you please, I don't like the change. I love my own dear, good mother better than I  e ever can you, I know,' was the little girl's reply. , "I have a great mind to pub you out of the carriage at once, you ungrateful, naughty child, when I have given -  -     <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6462-00000094"/> 208  THE  FORSAKEN    AUGH TER.       ! you such beautiful clothes, and aln going to make you so  happy!"

"Ant dese nice, pretty woods?" she said, "hi, look  dere quick, little Missy-dere's little squirrel scampering  up de tree-dere he goes-see--se! pretty soon we'll get out ob dese ole woods, and den youll see some pretty  little houses, and den, bime by, we'll come to a great big townl hi! and den, little Missy shall go in de steam-boat. -ebber seen steam-boat, eh?"             XI But the only answer of Amy, I am sorry to say, was a rapid jerking of her little elbows, and an emphatic  - "Do hold your tongue!"       - Old Sybil laughed to herself, and nodded her head ap- provingly at the little straw bonet, while her mistre ss - held up her hands in despair, as if she had undertaken the training of a  Wild Indian. : [  When at length the carriage cleared the forest and was i  once more in the open country, it was piteous to see the longing look the child would cast upon every farm-house j which they passed, and how she would strain her eyes to i watch the little children' playing in the fields or road. 'I Sometimes she would exclaim:      . "Oh that looks just like little Johnny I there-that lit- tle girl is almost as big as Lucy I fether has got just such ' a  horse, only his tail aint as pretty as old Dick's: I de- all  ,  /    ,            A.,i   THE   FO'RSAKEN   DAUGHTER.    209 clare if I should'nt think that was Bessie's cow, I am goiing to have one next spring, father said so l" and sometimes the child would sob outright, but seldom,-she seemed to have made up her mind that it would be of no use. Sybil ingratiated herself wonderfuilly in the favor of Amy before night, by listening to all her little talk, ask- ing questions about the children, and appearing much in. terested in the superior merits of farmer Leslie's geese and turkies, over those gobbling in the farm-yardsthey passed, or of the pigs 'grunting about the domiciles. The journey to Albany was a tedious one, and it was not until the evening of the third day, that they reached the capital. Here every thing was entirely new to Amy. She had never before seen a block of houses, or paved streets, and the sight of so many people passing and repassing, to- gether with the unusual bustle, confused and frightened , her-the poor child was glad to go to bed.           j Early the next morning they went on board the steam- boat, Mrs. Lorraine immediately retired to the cabin, but allowed Amy to remain on the deck with Sybil. Having been so successful in gaining the confidence of Amy, the old nurse thought now io speak a good word for her Mis- tress, so taking advantage of MrS. Lorraine's absence she now began praising her in- high terms. The faithful old soul longed to have her Mistress love the little girl, but she was afraid Amy was not taking the right wayg owin it. So she told her she was going to be such j/happy little girl, just as soon as they got home, that her listress loved her very much indeed, and was going to get her every thing beautiful, and that her Misses Anne was the l I          .

At length New York with her many steeples and long line of shipping hove in sight. It was evening, and the streets and houses were all lighted up. As they neared the wharf, Amy said it reminded her of the picture of Solomon's Temple, in mother's Bible, all stretched out with a candle in each window.      I "Now you are at home, Amy. Are you tired?" said Mrs. Lorraine, as the boat touched the wharf. Amy could not answer, she was so bewildered with the scene around her. The hlurry and bustle upon the deck, the pulling of the ropes, the passengers running this way and that, to gather their baggage, some rushing one way to greet a friend, others impatiently springing to the shore, the loud voices of the hackman, the crashing and confusion of carts and carriages, and t!hen so many people pushing her about that she had never seen before! She scarcely knew when Sybil lifted her into the carriage and told her to look out and see the pretty sights. - They drove up Broadway to Franklin street, then almost the suburbs of the city. - As the carriage rolled on, Amy , tho-ught herself in fairy land, passing in succession so I many beautiful houses, and brilliantly lighted stores, the ; windows all filled with pretty things,--she could not re- frain from clapping her hands and proclaiming her plea- sure volubly: "I told you so Sybil," said Mrs. Lorraine significantly, "I told you the child would soon forget."

There's an'ottoman, young Miss, won't you sit down, let me loosen the strings of your bonnet." Amy looked up in her face as she said this, and laughed outright, she could not help it. Jane smiled too, and said she'was charmed that her young lady did not appear more fatigued. Amy afterwards confided to Sybilfthat Jane's head reminded her of her father's old gobbler, so sharp and narrow with such long gills--meaning poor Jane's ringlets. After this inadvertent burst of laughter, Amy sat very still, looking about her with wonder and curiosity, think- ing whether Queen Esther, or the Queen of Sheba had such a beautiful place to live in. It was indeed a beautiful apartment, and might chal.-  lenge the admiration of a less unsophisticated person than our little Amy. The walls were of a delicate rose tint, ,bordered with a deep wreath of silver leaves. Over the mantle, which was of white marble finely chiseled, hung a portrait of Mrs. Lorraine herself, in all the matured loveliness of five and twenty. Other pictures adorned the walls, all appropriate to the apartment--Diana and her Nymphs, Venus rising from the Sea, Ariadne, and several other small ,but well executed paintings. A full length mirror swung in a frame of richly carved'rosewood, and opposite, another more spacious was set in the wall, sur rounded by a wreath of gold and ivory, the pendant flowers so' exquisitely carved that they seemed as if about to drop upon the toilet beneath them, which Was of pale -   , y   '  -  ' . ,     <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6462-00000097"/> 214  THE  FORSAKEN   DAUGHTER, sea-green velvet, hung around by a curtain of deep lace, and the windows were shaded by silken hangings of the same hue. The carpet was luxurious to taie foot, and Amy first thoughtsthat the bright roses falling from the oval basket in its centre, must be real roses, and she longed to pick one up. But what was nearly as strange to the child as all these novel surroundings, was the sudden change in the i manners of Mrs. Lorraine. That stately step and %rect bearing were superceded by a languid, indolent move .. ment, a sort of fine lady affectedness, and she spoke in low, die-away tones to Jane, which to little Amy was quite unaccountable and mysterious. "I am really too much fatigued, Jane, to endure the exertion of going down to supper," she said, " order it : sent up, and for your young lady too-hand me. my vinaigrette, Jane--now place that foot-stool nearer,-don't I look horribly?" "Oh, no, really, madam, considering your dreadful journey, you look charmingly, I am sure you must be exhausted I I will order some refreshment," saying which, Jane swept from the room. Mrs. Lorraine now sat erect, and resuming her natural tone and manner, said: "Amy I want you to listen attentively to what I am - going to say.

Amy looked up, the expression of Mrs. Lorraine's eyes were sorrowful, so the child put up her mouth and kissed her.  "' I will" try to love you, may-be I shall, by and by. Mother used to tell us that we must always remember that Jesus said, "Love your enemies," and a tear rolled down the cheek of the little girl. Mrs. Lorraine bit her lips: "So you think I am your enemy, childl if I had been, I should have left you to grow up in ignorance and poverty. I told you the other day, you must never tell me any thing more your mother said, as you call her!" "It was not mother, it was Jesus," answered Amny, quietly.          ' The entrance of the waiter, bearing supper, was oppor- tune, for Mrs Lorraine found more to embarrass her in - this simple little child from the back-woods, than an as- iemblage of gifted men or women had the power to doi, "Jane, is your young lady's room prepared?" she asked, languidly setting down her tea cup. "Yes, madam, all is arranged," replied Jane with a graceful wave of her hand. "I have, I believe, followed your orders, and I hope my young lady will find her apartment agreeable." "Come, Amy, I will show you where you are to sleep,' said Mrs. Lorraine, opening a door which led into a pretty little room adjoining her own sleeping apartment. It was a tempting place for any little girl.

Mrs. Lorraine rang the bell: "Send Sybil to your young lady; good night Amy."

' "Her smiles and tears-thel pass as light winds pass O'er lakes-to ruffle, not destroy their glass." L  \   BYRON. THE sleep of the little girl was brolren by the song of the sweep, and the shrill cries of the milk-man, mingling with those other discordancies with which a great city arouses from the arms of night. Half frightened, Amy sprang lightly from her bed, ran across to Mrs. LGorraine's cham-  ber, and opening the door passed softly through. It was  e all quiet, there was no sound except the ticking of the or- Molu clock which stood upon the mantle, and the window shades were still closely drawn down. Amy patted to the bed-side, but Mrs. Lorraine was not there. i She saw oily an old lady sleeping beneath those rose1colored curtains, her white hair escaping from the richly worked border of her cap, and her face looking yellow and cadaverous. The child tip-toed softly back, wondering who that old lady could be. She now ran to her window, and drawing aside the cur- tains looked out upon the morning.  UP MrWM9*i   THE  FO R SAKE    DAUG aTE R.   219 It was a strange sight to the little girl,--little plots of ground divided off by high white fences, some of them covered with creeping vines, others supporting fruit trees trained up against their sides. Some of the yards had handsome borders of gay autumnal flow- ers, and arbors covered with grape vines, the large pur- ple clusters hanging timptingly from the trellis, and others had only a brick pavement surrounding- a narrow patch of grass. Her further prospect was obstructed by high' walls of dingy brick, or unsightly weather-stained tenements of wood. Amy raised herself up on tip-toe, as if to look over them, but she only gained a small spot of blue sky over-head, and that was all which looked natural to her. Casting her eyes below, she now saw Sybil at work among the flowers in the little yard beneath. Softly open- ing her window, she cried: "Sybil! Sybil "!  , 5 The old woman looked up with a cheerful laugh:. "Hi 1 dat you Missy,-good morning, lady-bird." "Oh, Sybill what is all that noise?" continued Amy. "I have heard it ever so long."  "What noise?" said Sybil listening. "There-that-hark now, don't you hear?" for at this moment the cry, "    sweep ohs-ee    sound ed very near. " dat's only de little chimney-sweep, 'spect you see him pretty soon-yes, dere Missy-see dat little feller coming up dere out ob dat chimney!"' Amy laughed merrily as she saw the head of the little sweep emerge from a neighboring, chimney, wondering. how he ever got up there, and how he would ever get down and then as he poured forth his not' unmelo- dious music, she listened perfectly delighted.

The old nurse assented; so hastily dressing herself as well as she could, Amy tho' not without some difficulty,' found her way down into the yard.  The smell of the fresh earth, as she helped Sybil weed among the flowers, was sweeter to her than the fragrance of roses, for it reminded her of home, and while she busied her little fingers in pulling off the decayed leaves, or in tying up the stalks, hertongue fleiw very fast. She told Sybil about the nice little garden father gave her and Bes- sie, and how they used to get up before Sun-rise to weed it, and what pretty flowers they had, and that their rad- ishes were fit to pull before father's were--to all of which information, Sybil attended with the grave importance the subject demanded.        !  Amy thought the little yard very pretty, and she had never seen so many beautiful flowers before, but when Sybil took her into the conservatoryi where the gardener was clipping the delicious tea-roses, and sweet Heliotrope, to make into boquets for his mistress' drawing-rooms, Amy was enchanted, flying from flower to flower like a little humming-bird, and manifesting so' much pleasure, that the gardener gave her a little pot of pink daisies for her own-and Amy was happier than she had been yet. Sybil then led her up stairs into her own little room, and taking a neat pink gingham, and a little muslin apron from the bureau, proceeded to dress hler ore neatly than her own hasty fingers had done. Amy's toilette was soon completed, and she looked as fresh and sweet as a rose,- she needed no lair:dresser but a bowl of clear water, into which plunging her little head, she would just give it a   T HE FORSAKE N   DAU  HTER.    221 toss, and then the little curls would wreathe and twist themselves lovingly together, all spangled with water- drops over her head.            , . Sybil then informed her that she was to breakfast in the nursery with Jane, for that her Mistress always took I  that meal in her dressing-room: "And does that old lady eat there too?" inquired Amy. "What ole lady, little Missy?" "The old lady I saw in the bed this morning," and the child then told the old nurse of her early visit to Mrs. Lorraine's chamber. Sybil laughed to herself, and shook her head: "Well de Lord knows it's no wonder de child did'nt know Misses Anne's self wid out all dem flustifications and fixens up! 'spect I would'nt know her nudder " then turning to Amy: " now child, you must'nt nebber speak 'bout dat ole lady, 'cause Misses Anne won't like it, she be very 'tickler frien' of hers 1" After breakfast Amy went back to her own little room, where sheg tried to make herself haippy with her beautiful doll, and in looking over the pictures in her pretty books. It answered very well for a time, but her grief was too fresh to be long diverted even by such tempting bribes. She sat there alone, feeling very sad and very home-sick poor child, and when Jane ambled in to conduct her to the pre- sence of Mrs. Lorraine, she found her eyes were red and swollen from weeping. She strove to comfort her in the- choicest and most elegant language which she could com- mand, and looking in the glass as she took Amy's hand to lead her out, declared with a sweep of her ringlets, that  she really felt "sympathetically nervous " on her account, for which Amy said "thank you Jane!"She knew ftJaw,    <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6462-00000101"/> t22   THai   FORSAKE E N  DAU G H T E R. must have made an effort of some kind for her, 'tho she did not know what, and was therefore bound to receive her thanks. Mrs. Lorraine took no notice of her sad little face, but ringing the bell for Sybil, told her she had better take her young Mistress into the Park. She could not have sug gested a pleasanter diversion for Amy's thoughts, and when the child found herself in the square, her feet upon -the unfettered earth, and saw the trees and the grass about her, she sat down upon one of the little benches with a feeling of quiet enjoyment. To be 'sure the trees were nearly stripped of their verdure, and the grass looked  yellow and sere, yet it had charms for Amy beyond any- ttiing contained in the splendid adornings of the mansion she had just quitted. The trees seemedlikeoldfriends, and when she shut her eyes, and listened to the wind sweep- ing through their branches, they sounded to her ears like the old chestnut-woods. She did not care to run about, but sat perfectly still with the old nurse, watching the merry groups of little, children playing about under the trees, or trundling their hoops up and down the walks. Amy wondered if she should ever be as happy as they seemed to be, and if any of those pretty little girls and boys had been taken away, as she had from their father and mother.  Poor little Amy I The next day and the next were s ent in shopping, and it certainly would- have turned almost any little girls head to have had such a quantity of beautiful clothes as Mrs. Lorraine now purchased for he:. Dress-makers ,oo were kept in constant employ, until thei child was fitted out with such a ward-robe as Mrs. Lorraine thought be- came her future heiress. I    THE ? RSAKEEN    DAUGHTER.    223 When the pretty frocks, some of silk, some of white cambric, others of mering and gingham, were all com- pleted, Jane hung them up in Amy's closet, giving each one as she did so a dexterous shake, so as to display its particular beauties to the eyes of the little girl, who stood looking on with childish pleasure. She could not believe that all these pretty dresses were really hers, for she had never been the possessor of more than three at one time, in her life--there was her gown of dark woolen stuff which mother spun and wove herself, then she had a home-spun gingham for afternoons, and for Sundays she and Bessie had each a pretty blue and white calico, which father bought for them in Auburn. She looked at them over and over again, felt of them, examined the trimmings, and then running down into the green- house, she asked the gardener if he would'nt please to give her one of those handsome African lilies just burst- ingifrom its stalk. It was a presumptuous request, altho! little Amy did not know it to be such, for she had always plucked flowers at home as freely as God scattered them in her path. How- ever, the gardener had taken a great fancy to the child, so after a moments hesitancy, he cut the, flower and put it in her hands. Amy thanked him with sparkling eyes, and then running back to her room, she began examin- ing first the gorgeous lily, and then her gay dresses with great interest. "What are you doing Miss Amy?" said Jane,-who came in with a pretty little bonnet in her hand, which had just been sent home from the milliners.

"I told you,"-said Amy, suddenly drying her tears with her apron, and lookingly quite fiercely--"I told you I wanted my Amy clothes l" Sybil knew that her mistress had sent them up to the garret to get them out of the child's sight, and would be very angry if she gave them to her: "Well, I dun'no, I disremembers 'zactly where dey is," was her 'answer.

Then, pushing her on one side, she passed through into the dressing-room, where Mdrs. Lorraine sat sipping her chocolate, and daintily picking a chicken wing. The, child walked directly up to her and in a tone as if demanding a right, said: "Aunt I want my Amy clothes, if you please?" "Your Amy clothes I what is the child talking about l don't you know it is very rude to disturb me when I am X eating my breakfast?"

"What those horrid old things!" exClaimed Mrs. Lor- raine, setting down her tea-cup, " no child you cannot have them, why what possesses you, never ask for them again 1" "But they are mine, aunt, and I want them." "You will not have them: now go back to your room, what have you been doing to yourself, why you're a per- fect little fright!" Amy turned to obey her, and then asked in a milder tone:,  "Won't you please Aunt, let me have them, O I do Want to see them so muchl?" Mrs. Lorraine was angry at the pertinacity of the child, and said in her sternest manner: "You shall not have them, Amy I I will give them to the first beggar girl that comes along a nd that will end the matter l"  This was more than Amy could bear.

After a little while the anger of Mrs. Lorraine subsided. She could not help acknowledging that she was in the wrong. It was perfectly natural that the child should wish to Isee her clothes, and she had promised her too that she might have them, and when she remembered how carefully the little girl had rolled them up, and entreated they might be saved, she felt sorry that she had denied her simple request. Amy had always behaved well, and "  had exerted herself to be happy in her new home, and for this burst of temper she felt she was herself to be blamed.                   I - While in this mood, Sybil came in, and struggling with her pride, she finally told her she might give Amy the things, but on no account was she to let the child' know that it was with her permission: "You must make her think Sybil, that you got them without my knowledge, and that I would be very angry if I knew what you had done--now mind, Sybil-it will not answer for me to yield my authority so easily." ' I 'spect I'll manage- it," was the answer. Amy was still sobbing, but more in " grief than in an- ger," when Sybil came in with something concealed un- der her apron.

Then she ran to the glass, nodded with a j6y- ful laugh to the little Amy whom she had not seen so long, and then turning to Sybil gravely asked if she might wear them to the Park: "De luddy, no, child! you must jus gib dem tings right away to me, or else hide dei somewhere nudder- hi! hi! won't Misses Anne be most drefful put out, if she know I gib dem to little Missy!"

"Dear, dear little Missy, pray donft, 'spose ole Sybil- don't!" said the old woman, laughing aside. "Well, I don't want to hurt you, I am sure, Sybil, but I must tell aunt what you have done-I hope she won't be very angry with youl" so saying, Amy opened the door and stood once more before Mrs. Lorraine: - ': Aunt, I hope you won't be angy with Sybil, please don't, but here are my Amy clothes., She brought them :  *         '  -.

Mrs. Lorraine raised her eyes to the face of the little girl, and worldly as she was, she was touched by the honest purpose of Amy, the innate rectitude which for- bade her doing what she knew to be wrong. "You may keep your clothes, Amy," she answered, "although you were a very naughty girl this morning; but as you have shown so much self-denial in bringing them to me when you knew that Sybil had no right to give them to you, I will forgive you, and you may keep the things, as you seem to value them so much." "Thank you, aunt. I am very, very sorry I was such a haughty grl this morning I I know I was very wicked, but I could'nt help it somehow! I will try to be good always now -won't you kiss me, please, aunt?" Amy looked so much as her mother did when she was a little child as she said this, that for the moment, forget- ting all the bitter years between, Mrs. Lorraine drew her to her bosom and kissed her. "Don't be afraid," whispered Amy to Sybil, as she passed her at the door, "I don't believe aunt is very angry with you." "Now jus hear dat blessed little critter well, I'se wicked ole sinner I 'spect, to, cheat de little gal sol" said the old woman, slowly, shaking her head. *              \  t   "   ..    <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6462-00000105"/> 230   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGH TER. I CHAPTER XXVLI "Those dark eyes, lit by curiosity, flash beneath the lashes, And still her velvet cheek is dimpled with a smile." PROVERBIAL PHLOSOPHY. FOR two or three weeks Amy was left to do pretty much as she pleased. She could read her nice books, or she could go up in the nursery and play with dolly and her beautiful toys, or she could ruin in the Park with a hoop of her own. If she preferred, she could sit in the drawing-room with her aunt, dressed in one of her fine frocks, and see' all the ladies and gentlemen who called, each pronouncing her a " little love,' and the very picture of her aunt, which Amy thought very strange, tho' Mrs. Lorraine smiled complacently at finding herself thus again complimented through her little grand-child. a At the end of that time Amy was one morning intro- duced to a lady of middle age, of la grave yet pleasant countenance, whom she was told was to be her governess, that she was going to teach her a great many things, and that she must be a very nice girl and obey whatever Mrs. I Bowem said.                ' She was then led up stairs to a room in the third story. In the centre stood a large round table covered with green   I o THE  FORSAEKEN   DAUGHTER.     281 baize, upon which were placed piles of school books, writing books, slates, etcetera. A pair of handsome globes sat one in each corner, and several large maps were spread out upon the; walls. I Ah 1 little did the child know that her small, hesitating feet were treading in the very footsteps of her own dear mother-that those walls had once resounded with the tones of her mother's voice, that she had sat at that same table, and with head bent down pored over those books of learning, that with her hands those globes had been so often turned, and that; now, far off on a foreign shore, that mother knew not even of her child's existence I What strange events are brought about in the evolu- tions of time How much there is of romance in every heart and home were it only made known? In Kavanagh, Longfellow, speaking of the irresolute school-master forced "to teach grammar when -he fain would have written poetry," says "Mr. Churchhill never knew that while he was exploring the past for records of obscure and unknown martyrs, in his own village the ro- mance he was longing to find and record, had really oc- curred in his neighborhood, among his own friends." And so it is. Beneath every roof a Gobelin sits, making strange pictures of our lives, weaving in light and shade the mingled threads of hope and despair, joy and grief; may-be of shame, which form the tapestry of our lives, and through which we are daily walking on, on to the gravel Amy looked around the room with childish wonder. "I hope we shall pass many pleasant hours here, my little girl," said Mrs. Bowem, "and very profitable ones too. i Do you love to study, Amy?" "I think I shall like it very much," she replied.

"I hope you will, for if you learn your lessons well, I will make a very nice girl of you one of these days. Now before we commence our studies, I wish to know something of your proficiency--how far are you advanced in geography, Amy? can you tell me?" Amy hesitated, at length she made answer: "The surface of the globe is divided into land and water."  "True, child, of course you know that-but how many States have we?" "A state of grace and a state of sin, mother says," an- swered Amy, innocently.  Mrs. Bowem opened her eyes in surprise at this strange reply. "I see you don't understand, well, what do you know of arithmetic?" Here Amy felt more confident, and she began: "Twice one are two, twice two ar/ four, twice three are six, twice four --" "Very well, very well, can you do sums in long division?" "I don't know what you mean, ma'am," said Amy, shaking herad. "Well, grammar then-can you parse?" "I don't wish to if you please, I had rather stay here."              Again Mrs. Bowem opened her eyes wondering what kind of a twig she had now undertaken to bend. I "Can you write nicely, Amy?" "I can make pot-hooks nice as aLy thing," replied the -child. And you read well of course?"         t '    1      .1   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     238 "Yes, ma'am. I can read any where in the Bible without spelling, only some of the hard words, and the tenth chapter of Ne-Nehemiah, about Seraiah and Azariah, you know." Mrs. Bowem smiled: "Well, Amy, suppose we begin to-day. I dare say you will be al nice little pupil-come, draw up your chair." The little girl did as she was ordered, and sat down by the side of her governess. And thus Amy's education began. It was a great change for the child, from the free, joyous life she had been leading at the farm, to be cooped up all day-in that little school-room with the constant labor of study set before her. Not that she disliked it, on the contrary, she was very fond I of her books, and made rapid proficiency.  Mrs. Bowema found her extremely unin- formed, yet she soon discovered she had a fine mind, and possessed an eager desire for information, therefore she took great pains and pleasure in teaching her. But the child greatly puzzled her at times by her strangs remarks, and her scriptural quotations, always appropriate, yet sometimes excessively annoying; and she was finally obliged to forbid her from repeating the scrip- tures on pain of punishment, except on Suandays, when she told her she would hear her say as many verses as she liked. One day in particular she made Mrs. Bowem quite angry. The good lady had the bump of self-esteem pretty well developed, and, perhaps, had a good claim to it-she was fond of displaying her acquirements, and one day was expatiating very largely to her little pupil, who sat look- ing upon her as if she was really Solomon himself in all    <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6462-00000107"/> 234  THE  FORSAKEN    D A GHTE R his wisdom, when the child, slowly shaking her head, re peated:  ' Then I said inmy heart, that this also is vanity. For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever."  The mental education of Amy did not commence alone. Like Mr. Turveydrop, Mrs. Lorraine ;thought a great deal of "deportment." The manners of Amy were not from the school of fashion, but from nature. There was a quiet grace in her little figure, and in the pliant movement of her limbs, infinitely more pleasing than all the set forms which she was now daily forced to practice. She neither sat or moved quite genteelly enough for her fastidious aunt, and many lessons did she receive upon that' important subject, not only from Mrs. Lorraine, but from her governess, and the all-mannered Jane, upon her " down- sittings and her up-risings." The polishing process commenced therefore at once. Nature was very unceremoniously waved back to her native wilds, and Madame La Mode with her refining brushes, set to work upon the child. Fortunately Amy was not an apt subject-with all the rubbing she would be natural, would show the grain! Sybil was the only one upon Amy's Side. She grew wrathy:             "Nebber see such fuss 'bout noting! why de?le Harry could'nt de child come into de parlor widout spreading out her petticoats jus asif she wer gwine to fly 1" Under all this restraint the lttle girl sometimes tired of herself. She found herself and Amy very poor com- pany, there seemed to be nothing in common with them. If Amy wanted to play, her other-self was afraid she "I    r   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.    2385 would rumple her dress or soil her ribbons,-if Amy wanted to rush down into the yard and plunge her little hands in the rich loam, her other-self was shocked at the idea of making her fingers so black,--if Amy wanted to' pull off her shoes and stockings, and wade with her little blare feet through the rain puddles in the yard, her other- self put her hands before her eyes and cried "O fie l"-7if Amy wanted to put her little elbows on her knees and read her books, the other told her to sit up or she ypuld get crboked, and if she wanted to scamper like a kitten, her other-self said -it was not genteel I  She was very much flattered and petted by her aunt's visitors. Mrs. Lorraine did not always treat her kindly, for she was an overbearing woman, yet she afterwards atoned for it, as she thought, by the most foolish indulgence. Nor iwas Amy always obedient, although she never again gave way to such a violent exhibition of temper as we saw her lately indulge. In fact our little Amy was in a fair way of being spoiled. But she had acquired, or rather it was innate, a habit of reasoning awithin herself, if the thoughts of a child can be dignified with that name, and some little passage from scripture or a line from some hymn would always rise to her mind to check her vanity or curb her pride. The light from the little candle-stand in that humble kitchen of the old farm house, which she had looked upon with such childish reverence in her infant years, still played about her path, tho' in an atmosphere not friendly to its beams I The Bible was still her favorite volume, and she would often turn from the attractive tales of Fairy-Land to read    <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6462-00000108"/> 236   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER. about Joseph and his brethren, the history of Ruth, and the prodigal son.

She loved them just at dearly as ever--her father and mother, and! sisters, but she had ceased to cry when speaking of them .All her most pleasing anticipations, as did all her scenes of past happi- ness centre around the old farm house. Mrs. Lorraine would never allow her to speak of them in her presence, but old Sybil would bless the child, and hear patiently, over and over again, all her childish anecdotes. One day Amy inadvertently spoke of her mother, as she, of course, called Mrs. Leslie, inl the presence of Mrs. Lorraine. She was not in a good humor, and rashly told the child that Mrs. Leshe was not her mother-that she had only been sent to the farm house to nurse, and if she ever heard her call those low people her parents again, she should be severely punished. Amy listened incredulously: "Then where is my mother, aunt?" she asked. "'She is dead."' "Where is my father?" He is dead."  -  "Then I have'nt got any fathei or mother, nor no, Bessie, nor Lucy; nor little Johnny, fter all!" cried Amy bursting into tears, and sobbing titterly, ,.

Do you hear me, Amy? I shall be exceed ingly angry if you do-indeed I don't know what I should do to you!" "I promise you I will not," answered- Amy, "but .I wish you had'nt told me, for then I could have had my old father and mother, and now I have'nt got any I may I just ask you one cluestion, aunt-just one?" "Welll"        " "If Iwas only put there to' nurse, what made you come and steal me away? they hadint any right to me, had they?" said Amy.              ; "What a ridiculous question-steal go upto the nur- sery, Amy, but remember, not one word of this to Sybil, do you understand?"  "I won't speak of it, aunt; because I promised you I would not.' and little Amy kept herword. But her thoughts were often very sad and very busy.     <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6462-00000109"/> 238   THE: FORSAKEN     DA UGHTER I               I CHAPTER XXVII. 1 My tongue is rough, I have neither the voice Nor the heart of flattery about me--I have no Cunningin protestation!

Bowing politely to his customer, he proceeded to make inquiry as to the style and quality of the article she demanded. The eye of little Amy was on him. She started-- looked- again more earnestly, a glow of delighted surprise suffused her bright face, till her cheeks were as red as her ribbons, her eyes sparkled through a dew of pleasure, and with a joyous cry she bounded upon the counter, and  threw her arms about the neck of the'astonished sales- man:  "Oh, Harry! dear, dear Harry--how glad I am! dbnt you know me? don't you know your little Amy?" she said kissing him with almost every word.

Mrs. Lorraine tossed the goods from her hands back upon the counter, and rising up with her most stately man ner, she caught Amy by her elbow: "Amy, release your arms,-come away with me this moment," she exclaimed. "This little girl and myself are old friends, aEre'nt we Amy?" said Harry, still clasping her tightly to his bosom: "in fact Madam,"-he added in a lower tone,-" she has been my pet, 'since the day she was left in Betsy Leslie's arms--I was there, so you see I know  all about her!" Mrs. Lorraine was too much a  woman of the world to betray the emotion which these words occasioned; but drawing up her head still higher, she said: "Then sir, as my niece, you will please to consider her as unknown Il come away this moment, Amy!" The child burst into tears:  l "Oh, aunt, may'nt I stay a little while longer, please?

I Drive home 1" exclaimed Mrs. Lorraine, imperiously, and the spirited horses bounded forward, leaving Harry Gorden standing upon the curb-stone kissing his hand to the sad looking face looking from the carriage window as it rolled down the street. "Amy, who is that man?" said her aunt, drawing up the sash;  "Why aunt, he is my own, own Harry Gorden, and I do love him Iso I love him most as well as I do father, I must'nt quite you know I he always brings me something pretty, and takes me to ride in his uncle's chaise, his un. cle is a doctor, and don't you think he broughtme a beau- tiful doll once all the way from New York!

Nothing could have been more unfortunate, Mrs. Lor- raine thought than this unexpected rencontre. She had never dreamed of the possibility of Amy's being recog. nized, or meeting with any of her old associates at a dis- tance so remote from the scenes of her infancyl and now to chance upon a person who not only knew the child but knew so much, was an event as perplexing as it was un- foreseen.      - What had she not to fear this man, this Harry would betray her I her desertion of the child would be made pub- licl  The Leslies would come down upon her.

"Mrs. L-- of No. 2, St. John's Square, requests Mr Harry Gorden to call upon her at 7 o'clock this evening, upon business of importance." Super-scribing this to Mr. Harry Gorden, Salesman at Messrs.

THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.    243 Punctual to the hour, Harry Gorden was ushered into Mrs. Lorraine's boudoir, and as that lady has not yet del scended from her dressing-room, we will in the mean- while take the liberty to observe more closely our old friend. As Harry has now reached his twenty-seventh year, we must not be too familiar, we will therefore call him Mr. Gorden. Mr. Gorden then possessed a fine manly figure, broad shouldered, erect, and denoting the strength of Her- cules, such, as we see among our independent class of na- ture's noblemen--our farmers. He had a full, clear dark eye, piercing as the eagles, when excited by injustice to others, or personal wrong, yet soft as the doves when moved by kindness and affection I waving, almost curling. hair of the deepest brown, shaded a square open forehead, on which one might read the truth and greatness of his soul. In fine there was that in the appearance of Mr. Gorden, altho' blunt' both in speech and manners, which never failed to inspire respect and confidence. With a graceful sweep, Mrs. Lorraine made her appear- ance, introducing herself to her visitor, who in turn an- nounced,  "Mr. Gordon, from Auburn," laying! particular stress upon the word "Auburn.  "Sir, be seated," motioning to a chair. But Mr. Gordern, with a slight bow, remained standing, his arms folded, and one hand holding his hat. "I sent for you, Mr. Gorden, that I might have an op- portunity of conversing with you confidentially concerning I i the little girl whom you saw this morning, and who ap- pears to be a great favorite of yours-is it not so?" A bow was the only answer.    <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6462-00000112"/> 244  THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER. "No doubt it appears very singular to a person not ac- quainted with the facts, that a child of such tender age should have been entrusted to the care of strangers, ex- cellent people no doubt, but still'strangers. Yet there are circumstances, Mr. Gorden, which I cannot at present ex  plain, which induced such a procedure, in this case of the most urgent necessity," again like Antony -she "paused for a reply--none came, and she continued: "These circumstances, Mr. Gorden, exist still. Yet such is my anxiety for the future happiness of the child, that I have been induced to remove her from those worthy people. I wish her to'receive a better education, and have the advantages of such society as she could not pos- sibly have enjoyed in that remote district. You appear to be much attached to her, and I presume you would not willingly injure the child, or by any act of word or deed, militate against. her future advancement,-am I not right?"

I have said he was blunt in speech, and he now spoke from his honest heart the honest truth, and used no hypocritical gloss. Perhaps he was never more blunt, he certainly had never felt more excited. Waiting for a moment to ascertain if Mrs. Lorraine hlad finished what she had to say, he began: "I am a man o:f[ew words, madam. If I understand the whole upshot of what you have been saying amounts to this-you're in a scrape, and you are afraid of me.

"Now look here, Madam, it will be a confounded tight business-my tongue don't like the bit any more than a young colt, and to hear poor Betsy wishing with the tears in her eyes, that she knew where her child was, and moan- ing for her like a poor dumb animal that has lost her young, I tell you Madam, it will be' a thundering tight job for me to rein inl"  "But on Amy's account y6u will be secret " urged Mrs. Lorraine.            i "I have said it.

Even little Pauline appeared to comprehend the importance of that repose to her Ma'ma, for as she once looked up- and caught her father's eye fixed lovingly upon her, she pginted with her little finger to the pale sleep- er, and then with a sweet smile placed it upon her rosy lips : "Paul!"

Saville was too much affected to speak. Going to the window, he drew aside the curtains to admit more freely the evening wind, and then returning to the bed-side, he lifted Pauline from her mother's ams, and imprint. ing a fervent kiss upon her little mout placed her upon the floor:  "tWere there no letters to-day, Paul?: "None from home, dearest."

For a few moments neither spoke again.   Then beqkoning her'shusband with her thin, pale hand, she said: "I feel very faint, dear Paul-raise me, it may be death!"  Paul hastened to administer a restorative cordial, and ' bathed her face and hands with vinegar. She looked up with a sweet smile: "Thank you, dear Paul, I feel better now.

Her fond eyes no longer watching him, no longer obliged to feign calmness, when the storm of desolation was sweeping over his soul, Saville now gave way un- restrainedly to his grief. With all his efforts to delude himself into the belief that she was not yet to leave him, the bitter truth was, alas, but too self-evident.

The vesper bells chimed harmoniously with this glow- ing atmosphere, and both spoke of heaven I Slowly opening her eyes, Beatrice, with a sweet smile, extended her hand to Paul. ' May God have mercy on me 1!" he mentally exclaimed, for he saw the fatal hour had come. In that seraphic beauty there was already more of heaven than earth. He saw that the hand of death was even then loosing the soul of Beatrice from its frail tenement! Woe for the stricken hearted! Yet gently, tenderly was death performing his mission while around the couch blessed angels hovered, ready to bear their sister spirit to her home above. "Paul, raise me up a little, let me lie upon your breast I ah, my precious i child--don't waken her, Paul, raise us together int your arms." The wretched husband could not speak-he could only fold mother and child to his bosom in silent agony.

The canker worm will in time corrode and destroy the fairest plant which can gladden the eye with its beauty, even so had the early sorrows of Beatrice preyed upon her' tender frame. Her sufferings, like the canker, had un. dermined the stamina of her young life, while yet in its  freshest vigor, and, altho' the flower was still beautiful and its bloom  unsullied by decay, yet at the root the insi- dious work was going on. After the birth of her little girl, the disease assumed new strength.

Under their glowing foliage the grave lies hidden! With such flowers does consumption adorn her victims-their roots are in death! Never was there a more happy wife and mother, than Beatrice-never a happier husband and father, than Paul!- Pleasantly then did their days glide on-one bright dream of gladness. The sunny skies which bent over them, ,but typified the sun-light of happiness, in which their hearts rejoiced.  Aside from her failing health, there -was only one thought to disturb the peace of Beatrice, and that was the alienation from her mother. Herearly sorrows she had buried--he was too happy now to give them room in her heart. It was after the birth of her little Pauline, that she re- solved to make one more appeal to her mother's affec- tions. As she pressed her own dear child to her bosom, it appeared impossible that she should be again repulsed. With her maternal love so ecstatic and glowing, she could not believe a mother would refuse to listen to the plead- ings of her child I In this belief therefore, the first use Beatrice made of her returning strength, was to write her. It was a long and touching letter. It went back to the days of her, childhood. It explained away all the ignominy under which she had rested, through the baseness of Hubert    <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6462-00000120"/> 260   THE   FORSAKEN, DA UGHTER.

This was the letter which in the rashness (of unbridled passion, Mrs. Lorraine had consumed I by that act effacing all hope from the heart of her child, and destroying-her own happinessl Longr, long, and with patience did Beatrice await an an- swer, but when months passed on, and a year rolled by, thenwiththesic'kness of "hope deferred," she awoke from her cherished dream. The mail-bags in. 18--, altho' less pursy, were more slow in traversing the Atlantic, than in 1855, when puffed out with their own importance, in shape like one of Don Quixott's wine-skins, they bound from shore6 to shore, im- pelled by the breath of steam, and in the same ratio in- land communication was fettered to the slow lengths of clumsy stage coaches, and lean.

Yet such happy seasons did come to both. Seals were broken, and fond wordssof affection read with moist eyes and gladdened hearts, and tho' the broad Atlantic rolled between the writer and the reader, yet thought leaped all distance, and for the time they sat face to face, hand pressed with hand in pleasant communion.

"Sweet are the uses of adversity " Had the days of Beatrice always been as free from cloud, as since her mar- riage with Paul, she might never have been raised above earthly hopes and aspirations! But when through grievous wrong her early life had been overwhelmed -n the dark- ness of despair, a ray from heaven had penetrated the gloom, and guided her, a humble, trusting childto the feet of Jesus. She was now, therefore, resigned to go home when she should be called! It was for the sake of the dear ones she was to leave behind, it was for their desolateness alone that she grieved!

True he still pursued his glorious art-out it was to him a mere exchange of genius for bank-notes,-he had lost that heavenly fire which gave life to his creations. His conceptions were still beautiful, yet when brought to light they lacked the soul which should have given them per- petuity. For the soul of the artist is as important to his picture as the colors upon his pallet, or as the unhewn stone is to the sculptor-he cannot work without them, and yet what are they in themselves? mere spots of blue, red, green and yellow paint, or a block of senseless mar- ble! Let the painter spread those colors upon his canvass, a mechanical grouping of trees and water, of men and women, unless his soul pervade the work, giving life and harmony to the whole, what is it after all? colors only- merely an extended pallet! Or let the sculptor place himself before that solid mass, and hew and chisel the human form divine, yet unless his soul speak through that sculptured image-it is but senseless marble still  we see that it has limbs, and eyes, and mouth, yet for all that, there is no vitality-we look only upon a block of stone! Did Cole thus paint? Did Greenough thus create? The clime of Italy is not congenial to the gloomy walls of the misanthrope. One by one 'his acquaintances dropped away from him, preferring the more genial in. fluence of her glowing skies, and the rich research of her storied halls. Evea those friends who best loved him tired in time of those ascetic visits, and, therefore, Saville was left unmolested to the indulgence of his melancholy moods, which sometimes led him to rush forth like one   THE  FORSAKEN   DAUGHTER.     265 demented, from the face of man, and wander for hours amid the ruins of the Val d'Arno-ruins which the past has spared, as if to point the present to the vanity of earthly ambition. They have looked upon, the rise and fall of nations, have seen generations spring into life, flourish for awhile like motes in the sun-beam, and then pass silently away from sight and memory! And they still stand majestic-watching afar the countless multitude coming to join the solemn caravan of the dead wIich have passed on before. The only link which bound Saville to the world was 'his child, and even her presence, lovely as it was, some. times failed to cheer. She was inexpressibly dear to his widowed heart, and often, as, with saddening eye, he fol- lowed her slight, graceful figure flitting through his desolated home, the fear smote him that she was not long to gladden his sight,-she seemed too fair and frail a flower for earth. Pauline was the very counterpart of what her mother had been at her age, only more delicate. She had the same pure skin, fair as the lily with the tracery of azure veins transparent, the same almond shaped eyes of the deepest blue, with long, silken lashes, as if to shield them from all impurity, and she had the same rich pro- fusion of golden hair playing around her fairy-like form in streams of light. The forming of her young mind was his greatest solace, for in that he still seemed in communion with his lamented Beatrice. It was pleasant to carry out the views he had so often heard her express, to converse with her about- her mother, and implant in her mind the germ of those lovely attributes which so adorned her character. But combined with his other moods, this proved a very    <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6462-00000123"/> 266   THE: FORSAKEN      DAUGHTER. desultory sort of training, tho'-the seeds fell in good ground. As for her education, frail as he believed her constitu. tion to be he dared not confine her too closely to any set rules, it was a lesson to-day, perhaps another to-morr w, or quite as likely the following week, and Pauline was left meanwhile to amuse herself with hier nurse, Antonia, a good, faithful girl, who liked well this immethodical way of life in which she and her young charge were permitted to indulge. Sometimes strolling about in the pleasant public gardens, row mingling in with the gay multitude which, on foot or in dashing equipages, 6thronged the more frequented walks and drives, now indolently reclining themselves upon the grass beneath the shade of olive trees- in some sequestered glade, or hand in hand gliding in solemn awe through the dim ailes of some venerated church, and dropping devoutly upon their knees before the image of every saint, for Pauline was a firm little friend to the good saints, of whom Antonia related such surprising miracles-or at other times they would stop at the corners of the street, hemmed in by the idle crowd,-and listen to the wild chant of the Improvisatore. Thus was she allowed to come and go just 'where she pleased, or wherever Antonia chose ,to take her-so long as he saw his little girl well and happy, Saville gave hitm self very little anxiety about the improvement of her Italy has been called the clhie of song, and Pau- line was a glad little creature, all sunshine and music.

She had caught too the art of the Improvisa- tore, and if ever she succeeded in winning a true uncloud- ed smile from her father, it was when she would place her- self before him, and, taking her little guitar, recite in child- ish phraseology some wonderful adventure of herself and Antonia.                     , Thus passed the first eight years of Pauline's life. A sort of Humming-Bird existence among flowers and sun. shine and song; never stopping to imbibe deep draughts, but ever on the wing sipping delight from all. And now Saville began to experience the evils attend- ant upon those years of morbid gloom. His health rapid- ly declined, for with the "mind diseased" his vital ener- gies had also suffered. With the loss of health, came also the bitter thought that by his death his child would be thrown defenceless upon the worldl To breathe his last sigh in Italy, and be buried by the side of Beatrice, had ever been his wish, but how could he leave his lovely child alone and unprotected in that luxurious clime I He shuddered at the thought He therefore decided upon re- turning to his native land-there, he felt he might leave her without any protection, save her innocence. Yet that dire calamity he might avoid-he had pro- mised Beatrice, that he would, some day take her child to her mother, he would-do so now. Time must have soft- ened the heart of Mrs. Lorraine, to look with kindness upon her daughter's memory even had she been guilty    <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6462-00000124"/> 268'  THE  F'ORSAKEN    DAUGHT-ER. of the charges imputed to her, but when he should make known her perfect innocence, then with what affection she would receive Pauline to her bosom, hap- py that, by kindness and love to the orphan, she might, atone for the injustice which she had heaped upon her mother 1 He knew not, however, whether Mrs. Lorraine was living, whether Dr. Woodville still lived I And now bit- terly did he condemn himself for the neglect with which he had treated the letters of that excellent man, until they came no more to importune him. It might bel the hand of death which had checked those kindly messengers of love, and that the great good heart from which they sprang, was even now cold in his grasp I There was another motive which impelled him to take his child to his native land, a duty, which the anxiety upon her account, made more vivid by his sure decline, now urged itself upon himj Lovely and good as little Pauline was, he saw she needed the rein of disciplinet was time she should be made subject to the laws of order, and her vol- atile fancies be brought under restraint.  His arrangements were soon completed, and his little household scattered. He could not take the faithful An- tonia with him, for such had been his improvidence, that he had but sufficient means to defray the expenses of the voyage, and provide temporary shelter upon arrival. Taking little Pauline by the hand, he led her for the last time to the grave of her mother, feeling that even his child's happiness could hardly compensate for the sacri- fice he was making in tearing himself away from those beloved remains.

CHAPTER XXXI. 'One whose mind, Appears like a ceremonious chapel Full of sweet music." WEBSTER. It was fortunate for Amy, who in our shifting pro. gramme is again before the reader, that Mrs. Bbwem was a woman of correct principles, who looked notlmerely to the superficial graces of her young pupil, or deemed that with her mental accomplishments, she need have no charge of her moral improvement. To Amy, this was all im- portant for with her aunt's petulence, her pride, and her " exaction, with Sybil's well-meant but weak indulgence, joined to the foolish flatteries of the maid, she required the counteracting influence of such a person as Mrs. Bow. em. One who was always consistent, ever kind, but never indulgent when the good of her pupil required a strict enforcement of her rules, never urging her counsel when Amy   was not in the mood, but judiciously seizing the right moment, gently reason and overcome the error. Amy loved and respected her. There were manytimes it is true, when self-will was opposed to the stern decrees   THE  FORSAREN    DAUGHTER..     271' of her governess, and the old temper would rise up ready for rebellion, yet ere the tear of passion had dried upon her cheek, or the frown passed from her brow, she would throw her arms about her neck and entreat to be forgiven. Thus she learned to curb her temper, while she retained all that natural independence of character, which now as in her earliest years made her shrink from oppression, or injustice. Mrs. Lorraine, justly proud of the capacities of her grand- child, spared no expense upon her education. With quick application, and a retentive memory, Amy's little head at fourteen, was well stored with the useful and ornamental,- the latter was all which Mrs. Lorraine would have required in the furnishing, but with Mrs. Bowem's assistance, she had contrived to slip in many a solid tho' less pretending ar- ticle. She could read and translate French with ease and even elegance, had some little knowledge of Italian, and with a correct ear and graceful touch gave promise of great excellence in music. Amy found nothing dull which was placed before her, and never felt so happy, as when,after pouring patiently for hours over some mathe- matical problem, she mastered the key, and with spark- ling eyes proclaimed her success. But the perfecting of her education remained with her- self, as it must with every youthful mind. The ground- work was laid, and the seeds planted by other hands,- now she must till the soil ;herself, and it rested with her whether the seeds thus sown, were to be lost amid weeds and rubbish, or bring forth perfect fruit,--for weeds or flowers will spring up in every mind,--it cannot remain inert. Mrs. Lorraine did not find our little heroine, by any means the pliant willow which she expected to bend to ,            I     <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6462-00000126"/> 272  .HE   FORSAICKEN  DA U G ITE R her wishe, not when those wishes were Sith as the con- science of Amy told her were wrong  She was always respectful to her aunt, always kind. No one had more patience than Amy with all her whim, or was so attentive to her many self-loving requirements for ease, at the expense of others comfort, and if she was ill would never tire of waiting upon her,-she would stand for hours by ]ier bed-side rubbing her temples and doing every thing in her power to relieve her sufferings. But she would never yield up her self-respect, her self- rectitude, nor would she refrain if necessary to speak, from giving utterance- to her true thoughts, even if by so doing, she should incur the severe displeasure of her aunt. Often die her artless yet bold declarations of right and wrong, put to shame the studied sophistry of Mrs. Lorraine, who c uld but respect her even for those very traits which most displeased and annoyed her. Amy wfshed she could love her, and often wondered why she could not. Sheifelt grateful to her for her many kind- nesses, but that was all,--she could not respect her, and therefore, could not love her. There are cases in which love may exist without respect, we may love and cherish those tenderly, whose foibles wring, our hearts with sor- row-but we cannot respect them. I doubt whether a child can really respect a dissolute father or mother, al- though they may love and pity them. Amy, however, felt no such claim to love Mrs. Lorraine. Her earliest asso- ciations with her were those of violence, and a sundering of her dearest ties, and since then she had discovered no particular trait in her character as it developed itself which could command her respect-on the contrary. Poor Amy had discovered who that "old lady" was whose identity had so greatly puzzled her the first few   TH R FOTS R AK ' DAU GHT ER.    273R weeks after her arrival in St. John's Square.

Mrs. Lorraine had a set code of the necessaries and be- longings to "good society" of which religion was one- that is, the "cream-cheese" religion of Mrs. Potiphar re- duced down to skim-milk. She owned a pew in St Johns, with cushions of crimson velvet, kneeling be ches en suite and like Milton's Deliah she came sailing in, "Ornate and gay, Like a stately shi;, With all, her bravery on, and tackle trim, Sails filled, and streamers waving." And sinking her knees into the yielding velvet, beiried her face gracefully within her perfumed handkerchief, and then listened or seemed to listen with becoming sanctity to the words which fell from the lips of the excellent Bishop H--, under whose spiritual teachings she weekly sat. Yes, religion was a very good thing in its, way, very respectable, very prosy to be sure t but this sitting down to read the Scriptures for pleasure, as Amy did, was per- fectly incomprehensible I so strange when there were so many other more useful and entertaining books on which she might spend her time. These sentiments were usually addressed confidentially to Jane, who, with upturned eyes, would exclaim : "Upon my word, madam, it is as you say the most un. accountable thing in nature.

Forbidden, however, to speak of those past days, it was only to Sybil she ever dwelt upon them. Not even to Mrs. Bowem did she betray aught of her earlier associa- nions, because her aunt had commanded her silence. She had never forgotten her staunch friend, Harry Gorden. Her accidental meeting with him had the effect to impress his features upon her mind too forcibly to be soon obliterated. She was sure she should know him any where, and months after that happy Iday, she never went out without taking hope with her that she might meet him again. More than once she was half-tempted to run away down into some of those busy streets and inquire at every door, if that was Harry Gorden's I and in those more childish days, whenever she felt herself aggrieved by an act of injustice or of real discipline, then the form of Harry would arise in the distance as her champion, he was to come to her rescue, and slay her aunt and her gov- erness as David slew Goliah /I True to his word, Gorden had never betrayed his' know- ledge of Amy.  j  .                 ^    <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6462-00000129"/> 278  THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER. Once in a season he left the busy turmoil of the city behind him, shook the hot dust from his feet and fled to the green haunts of his childhood, there to refresh him- self amid rural sports and scenes for the dull routine of Pine Street. He was no sentimental lover of dame na- ture, however, always praising her beautiful face, and the silver tones of her voice in the laughing brooks,-he was much more prone to disturb her repose by the sharp crack of his rifle, and shiver her mirrors with the tip of a fishing-rod. Leslie Farm was always the first place he visited upon these annual revolutions of town and country, and when he heard his old friend, Mrs. Leslie, always expressing the same affectionate sclicitude for her little Amy, it was, as he told Mrs. Lorraine, a " thundering tight job to rein in" -upon these occasions, when driven to the last extremity of impatience to break out with his secret, he would sud- denly start up to the great surprise of all and protest that he must go that very instant or may-be with a loud "shoo I shoo!" he would rush to the barn-yard, creating a great stir in the feathered family, declaring to Mrs. Leslie that he saw a large hawk pouncing down among the chickens, generally adding, "like that old she hawk who stole away Amyl" Gorden not only preserved the secret safe, but he also avoided coming in contact with his dear little pet, because, poor thing, if seeing him would make her home-sick and discontented, he would keep himself away from her sight. That is, she should not see him-there the restriction ended, for so long as he remained in the city, he kept a jealous vigil over the little girl, and the maiden of four- teen I Often of an evening would he stroll in the vicinity of the Park, and there, concealed by the foliage of the   THE  FO RSAKEN   DAUG HT  R.   27' trees, he would watch for the light form of Amy at the opposite window. Sometimes she would come bounding along with Sybil almost touching his garments as she passed! O, how he longed then to catch her to his breast --his own' little Amy, and kiss her rosy lips I And again as she sat by the open window, or at the piano, and he could hear her flute-like song, it thrilled him with plea- sure. He saw how lovely she was as she advanced to womanhood, and he almost ceased to regret her abduction from the farm, for now her talents were so finely develop- ing themselves, whereas had she remained there, they would have been confined within the then narrow limits of cottage life, which in those primitive days at the West, could boast none of the modern advantages. It was a great pleasure to him that Amy never seemed unhappy, and he began to think that Mrs. Lorraine was not quite as bad as she seemed. When Amy was fourteen, Gorden renounced his sur- veillence over her from necessity. Having accumulated a snug fortune, he exchanged those "Castles in Spain," for a pleasant little farm on the banks of the Owasco, left New York, and established himself in all the independence of a Bachelor Farmer, with a maiden aunt in the capacity of house-keeper, and once more resumed the occupation of his boyhood and youth. 17 i  : 1 '      I   .    <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6462-00000130"/> 280   THE   FORSAKEN    DAUGHTE R. CHAPTER    XXXIII. "' Who come so gracefully Gliding along?"  -I B   ,         l AT seventeen a splendid ball introduced our heroine to the fashionable world, as the heiress of Mrs. Lorraine. Long and impatiently had the latter waited for this aus- picious hour, forgetting that every year which was per- fecting the loveliness of Amy, was adding fresh wrinkles to her own brow. Her own "particular star " to be sure had long since paled from the zenith, the finest telescope could not now detect " the Lorraine " which once eclipsed all other stars, by its magnitude and brilliancy. But through her, ano- ther orb was now to astonish the world-again " the Lor- raine" should be in the . ascendant, so like in brilliancy, that the old star-gazers should declare that "I the Lorraine" so long invisible in fashion's galaxy, had again appeared more glorious than ever. , All that wealth could purchase, that taste could plan, or art perfect, combined their attractions to render this ball the most elegant of the season, while in personal "getting up," Mrs. Lorraine that night eclipsed herself in \the per- *  I   I   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.    281 feet finish of her toilet. Her dress, her ornaments, were all superb, and she looked and moved as a queen. Amy had petitioned for a more simple adorning, than her aunt was willing to grant-she had no conception of " beauty unadorned," and was ambitious, that neither in dress, nor in loveliness, should her heiress be excelled. So, robed in white satin, embroidered with silver, with clustering pearls upon her fair neck and arms, and gleaming pure and white from out her raven tresses, Amy made her debut as Miss Lorraine,-and " all the world were there to see," for the brilliantly lighted rooms were crowded with the "dear five hundred" whom Mrs. Lorraine had called together. The sensation produced by Amy's advent fully satisfied the pride and vanity of her aunt,-her pride, because this new attraction belonged exclusively to her, and could not be approached except through her; her vanity, because, she knew that many eyes were following her; as with queen- ly gait she swept through the rooms with Amy leaning upon her arm, and because her ears again drank in the adulation of the crowd, who by flattering her, hoped to win her favor with the fair girl by her side. And now following this initiatory ball, party succeeded to party, in rapid rotation, all given in honor of the new debutante, each one striving,'like children blowing soap-bubbles, to make their's the largest and most gor- geous ere it "sank in the deep and silent lake" of ob- livion. The life of Amy that winter was one continued round of gayety, it cannot be termed enjoyment, for she did not participate in its pleasures with that zest which makes a first season, so particularly fascinating to many happy young hearts, who go forth oaly prepared for the roses of life, and think not of its thorns.

Ah, a blessed thing is that happy un- consciousness of youth, that joyous sunshine of th6 breast" which glows upon their countenances! Would that it might rest thereon forever-that light of happiness,--and that there were fewer who awake from this dream, only to take up a sad and wearisome burthen through the vale which lately seemed so fair and glowing I For the first few weeks, giddy with the excitement and novelty of her position, Amy was swept along in the gay vortex--it was all so new and so delightful I Yet ere orie little month had passed, it became irksome to her, and she would have been glad of the privilege of spending her evenings at home. X But private readings, and private hours, did not suit Mrs. Lorraine'a calibre, and if there chanced to be one unappropriated to which Amy would be looking forward with pleasure, her aunt was always sure to issue her "at homes." It was generally understood that siss Lorraine was an heiress, which fact brought around her a swarm of for- tune-hunters, who began to think that even the yoke of matrimony could be endured, if it was a golden yoke, but when so fair and lovely a creature should place it upon their shoulders, why it would positively be quite tolerable. Our heroine, however, was too pleasing to be sought alone for wealth-there were many who ad- mired her for herself. Her manners were perfectly lady- like and self-possessed, removed from that hauteur which ever characterized Mrs. Lorraine, and yet betraying none of that careless levity in which many young ladies iridulge.

And thus ended Amy's first winter.

Mrs. Lorraine usually passed the summer months at her country-seat upon the banks of the Hudson, not re- mote from the spot where our beloved Irving is now en- joying the delightful repose of a life well spent amid those scenes of nature which his pen has rendered so charming Ahl there is not a heart in the land but has a blessing for him as he now sits there, "in the veritable elbow-chair of Manhattoe's historian," with "his old cocked hat still hanging on a peg against the walll" ,Long may he live to enjoy that elbow-chair, and from that "antique writing-desk" send forth the effusions of his genius to gladden all hearts! Such is the prayer of one among the thousands who have dwelt with smiles and tears upon the pages of Nature's true Laureatl But the summer following this gay winter, Mrs. Lor- raine announced her intention of spending the fashionable   T E  FO  S A K EN DAUGHTER.    235 season at Balston and Saratoga, which were then in the full tide of novelty for the pleasure-seeker. To Amy this announcement gave more disappointment than pleasure. She had been anticipating so much that quiet summer at Lorraine Park, and never more so than now. Those brief episodes in her life, when for three months her aunt do- mesticated herself in the country, were delightful to her. There were so many pleasant associations connected with those noble trees and spacious lawns,-never would the visions of her childhood arise at her bidding so vividly, as when here, altho' nothing could be more unlike than the stately grandeur of Lorraine Park, dnd the humble \ unpretending Old Farm-House! the only similarity was that possessed in common with every other country place --viz:-shady trees, green grass, the birds and the blue' sky. * She entraated her aunt to leave the city earlier this sea- son, that they might spend a week or two at the Park, ere fashion's bell should ring them on to her gay halls. But to this request, Mrs. Lorraine would by no means consent -why the idea was perfectly horrid "The country in April  Do Jane give me my Cashmere, really Miss Amy has chilled me at the thought!" But to the chills of April, was added the fever of ap- prehension, lest by complying with Amy's request, those important allies of fashion, the dress-makers, could not be attended to in time there was so much to be done, ere she could possibly be prepared to commence the summer campaign at Saratoga in full uniform. However, as a salvo, she promised her that on the first of May, she would just take a drive out to ithe Park, and, perhaps, spend a week there, so as to give her in opportunity to look after her favorite little pony, her several families of rabbits !     <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6462-00000133"/> 286  THE  FORSAKEN"DA iUtGTER. and guina-pigs, and the other various pets, both four legged and feathery, which Amy had taken under her espe- cial protection.     '  '  The promised morning at length arrived to which Amy had been looking forward for several weeks with such pleasure, equalled only by that of Sybil, who, through the intercession of her "little Missy," was permitted to accom. pany the party to Lorraine Park, for she declared it would do her old heart good to see the green trees, and smell the fresh grass. The carriage was already at the door, when the waiter informed Mrs. Lorraine, that a woman was below in the hall who wished to speak with her: "Stupid why didn't you send her away, John, at oncel you know very well I have no time to attend to her now." "So I told her Ma'am, but she says her business is ur- gent, and that she must see the Madam." "Really must indeed Htell her to be gone this moment, and remember not to repeat this annoyance " exclaimed Mrs. Lorraine, arranging her veil more gracefully-" these creatures are so persevering--their obstinacy isreally provoking!" she continued. "Oh, most excessively provoking, Madam " chimed in Jane, as if her Mistress had intended the remark for her. In a few moments John returned, and with a most com- ical air of perplexity stood at the door: "I beg pardon, Ma'am, but, but----" "But what, John? speak out ". said his Mistress sternly.  That woman, Ma'am, I declare she does hang on so,- she says she won't go until she has spoken with the Ma. s   S en  w .

"This is really intolerable!" exclaimed Mrs. Lorraine, "tell her that your Mistress will not see her, and that if her business is so very urgent, she may call next week. Some beggar I suppose, bringing some-body's else child here, with a long and pitiful story!" True enough; Mrs. Lorraine. "Shall I go down and speak with her, Aunt?" said Amy,-" perhaps she may really be in great want." "Then there is the Alms House I but go, get rid of her at any rate." "Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal," repeated Amy softly, as she tripped down stairs.  In the hall stood a plainly dressed, but very respectale looking woman, holding by the hand a little girl, a pa rently about nine years of age: "What is your business with the lady of the house?" she asked kindly, "she cannot see you now-can I be of any service to you?" "I don't like this way of treatment, I must say,"-said the woman,-" when I only came to oblige other people, -however, I have undertaken to do a kindness for a poor sick man, and I aint going to be driven from peo-  ple's doors either" " "I am sorry if you have been treated rudely," replied Amy- " tell me your business, and I will inform my aunt. Come in here," she continued, leading the way into the breakfast room. The woman seemed calmed down by Amy's gentleness, and taking the chair offered her, she said:    <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6462-00000134"/> 288  THE  F OR  A K   A U G TTT E R. "Well, if your Aunt won't see me, then 1 suppose I i must do my errand to you, for I really think something has got to be done, pretty soon,-go out there by the win- dow dear, and look at the pretty birds in the cage,"- she said to the, child, "for I don't care about the poor  little thing hearing what I have got to say," she added in a low tone to Amy. The child walked to the window, and sat down. ' Well Miss" continued the woman, ".about two weeks ago, or more, there came to my house,-I keep a board- ing-house in Coienties Slip,--a sort of foreign gentleman, and that little girl his. daughter. The po6r man was so dreadful ailing, Miss, when they brought him from the ship, that he could scarcely stand on his feet, and just as soon as I could fix a room for him, he went right to bed, and there he has lain ever since-the poorest skeleton of a man you ever saw  I declare it is enough to make one's heart ache to look at him. Well, he said he guessed he should soon get better, and then he was going to take his little girl to see some of his friends, but the poor man you see, don't get any better, and I don't believe he ever will-he is a real nice gentleman, and so pleasant spoken I and dear, dear how he does worship that child--and the poor little thing won't leave him one minute, but is all ways kissing him and hanging around the bed, talking to him in some kind of a foreign tongue,-well, Miss, last night he was dreadful bad, and I really thought he was going to die right off, and'he asked me if I would'nt bring his daughter here this morning, for he said he was afraid H he should have to leave her soon," here the good woman wiped her eyes, while Amy's countenance expressed all the sympathy her artless recital awakened: "I promised him I would, for I would do any thing to serve such a s      s   2 8 ' TH E FORSAKEN D AU Gt    TER.   2 nice man, but I must say, I did not expect to be treated like a beggar! here is a bit of a note the gentleman wrote, but he could'nt finish it, he was so weak and kind of agi- tated like,-but he said the laWy would understand it,- there it is, and now Miss if you will give it to her, I will wait for an answer." Amy had listened to this recital with surprise and pity for it was evident that it had some near connection with her aunt: "I will give Mrs. Lorraine the note,-perhaps I had 'better take the little girrlup stairs with me: will you go with me, my dear?" she said, holding out her hand to the At the sound of her gentle voice, tife little girl raised to hers a pair of large blue eyes of great beauty, and then turned them inquiringly upon her companion. "Yes, my dear, go with the young lady, I won't leave you," said the woman; "here, let me take off this old bonnet. I was really ashamed, Miss, to bring the ch5ld here in such a looking thing, biut you see she had'nt any kind of a covering for her head, only one of them big, round straw hats such as we see in pictures of foreign parts, so I just put on one of my old sun bonnets," say- ing this she united the strings, and took it off the little girl's head. As she did so, Amy thought she had never before seen any thing half so lovely as- that act revealed,-a little creature so fair, so delicate, her. slight form but half-re- vealed through the profusion of golden curls which leaped around her. / "Aint she a pretty little thing?" said the woman, who noticed the admiration the child inspired.

"I will," answered the little girl in sweet tones, placing  her little hand in hers. Amy's whole frame thrilled at the touch. An indefina- ble sensation came over her, and she could scarcely refrain from clasping the little girl to her bosom, and shedding those tears with which her heart seemed welling up. The child too seemed drawn by some strange affinity to Amy, for looking up with a sweet smile into her face, she whispered: "I love you "  Such was the first meeting of the two sisters!

"Aunt, this little girl seems in some way to belong to yo ," said Amy, nob drawing the child forward-" and has bee sent here by a gentleman whom the person says who brought her, is too ill to come himself."

Amy stooped down, and picking up the pieces, said:, "I beg your pardon, aunt, but this note :may be ot more importance than you think. If you will not read it, I will." Mrs. Lorraine was too much astonished at the audacity of Amy to offer any opposition, who, joining the two pieces, read: "Mrs. Lorraine. I am   dying.

"Amy, you don't know what you ask!" answered Mrs. Lorraine in a troubled voice-" if you knew all, all I have suffered, you would not ask me to look upon that child!

I am not ungrateful, but I dare speak to you, aunt, when I think you may be convinced that you are about to do a great wrong, a most unchristian deed, which may rest heavy upon your soul hereafter!"

The insulted girl made no reply. Although every fibre quivered at the indignity, she bravely restrained her temper. She turned from her, and leading the now weeping little girl, walked slowly away.

"My name is King, Miss, and I live at No. 12 Coien- ties Slip -the name is on the door, and if you know of any person who would like a nice clean boarding-place, I hope you will remember me." "I ihall be glad to serve you, Mrs. King," replied Amy. "You can tell the gentleman that he will hear from Mrs. Lorraine very soon. Will you give me a kiss, my little Pauline before you go?"

She rose to cross the room, but ere she had taken three steps, she fell upon the floor in a swoon.    <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6462-00000139"/> -298  THE  FORS A KEN   DAUGHTER. Very much frightened, Amy summoned assistance, Mrs. Lorraine was placed upon the bed, bnd a messenger im- mediately despatched for a physician. It was more than an hour ere the unhappy woman was restored to consciousness, and not until after the physi- cian had freely bled her'  "Your aunt's nerves seem in a very excited state, my dear-has any thing unusual happened?" he asked. ! "My aunt received a note this morning which appeared to agitate her," answered Amy--"do you consider her very ill, doctor?" "Tut, tut no child-she must be kept perfectly quiet, that's all, and free from any kind of excitement, and shb will be well in a few days.: I must give her an opiate now, for it is all important that for the next six or eight hours she should rest, and I see by her excited state, that she will not sleep without it. Be under no uneasiness child, your aunt will soon be better." Under the effects of the opiate, Mrs. Lorraine soon. be- came more calm, and at length fell into a quiet slum- ber. Leaving her with Jane, in whom she knew she could place perfect confidence, Amy then stole out softly, and- sought the nursery, whither old Sybil had fled from the anger of her Mistress, and knew nothing of her subse- quent illness:  "Now bless de Lord for the sight of you, Missy I dis ole heart most broke for sure!" she cried, bursting into tears, as Amy opened the door.

IN a small back room, offensive from the smell of  f bilge-water and the effluvia from the dock which the wind wafted in through the open window, was Paul Saville. He was half-reclining, propped up by pillows upon a low bedstead which was uncurtained, and thoe' cleanly, the bed-clothes were all of the coarsest fabric. The apartment was neatly arranged, and the uncarpeted floor as white as hands could scour it. A candle-stand covered with a white cloth stood at the head of the bed on which were two or three vials of medicine, and in a small wine-glass a bunch of spring violets which Mrs. King had brought from market, to. cheer, with their balmy beauty, the dreoping invalid. A small cherry table and three wooden bottomed chairs were all the furniture the room contained. Could there have been a greater contrast presented to the eye or sense than between this humble roof, this    <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6462-00000141"/> 302   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGaHTER. close, fetid atmosphere, and that charming dwelling upon the Arno, under the glowing skies of Italy, and redolent with the odors of that fair clime I Yes--the contrast was greater in the man I in the artist, when in the full ardor of hope and love he took possession of his paradise, and in the poor shattered mind-racked man resting upon that lowly bed--the one was a mere change of the external, the other the wreck of manhood I As the stream which comes down the mountain-side, struggles to force for itself a channel through the bowlder rocks and decaying underbrush which lie scattered at its base, was the early life of the farmer-boy, striving to work a path on to fame and fortune--as that same rivulet leaping free from all obstructions, and gliding gloriously on its course, swollen by other streams, and growing broader and broader, and more beautiful, even such was the pro- gress of the artist, when, by perseverance and toil, he conquered all obstacles and passed God-like to the goal of genius I but alas, that mountain rill, that glorious river, has now become a turbid stream, rushing on to the broad ocean to be lost to the eye forever in her fathomless depths-and so, the ardent hopes of the farmer-lad, and the triumphs of his genius-where are they? you look for them vainly in that poor worn out frame--life is ebb 1 ing fast4 eternity is near, and in that untold, solemn mys- tery all will soon be resolved. The voyage from Europe had been long and tempestue ous. Saville daily grew more feeble, and it was the opinion of all on board the vessel that he would never live to reach his native land. He feared so himself. His anxiety for his child amounted almost to agony as he thought of her helpless situation should he die ere the termination of the voyage, and the mind thus tortured   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER,     303 necessarily rendered his bodily sufferings more acute. His prayer was granted, and he once more breathed his native air. He deluded himself with the belief that a few days repose from that dreary, sickening Iife on ship-board would recruit his exhausted frame-that he should soon be sufficiently recovered to accomplish his only earthly wish, which was to place Pauline under the protection of her grand-mother. Poor Savillel with but little pmens, he had accepted the plain roof of Mrs. King, recommended by the cap- tain, until he should be able to commerice his labors anew. Two weeks passed, and still he was prostrate upon the bed of sickness, only able once a day, perhaps, to totter feebly across the little room, and for the last few days even that strength had failed. There came to him now the dreadful certainty that death was near, that his days on earth were few, and that he must immediately seek some other way to present his orphaned child to Mrs. Lorraine than by personal inter view. A day of extreme debility decided him to defer no longer. He, therefore, claimed the kind services of his landlady, who had always manifested much kindness and sympathy. He attempted to write a letter of explana- tion-of all which he would himself have told her, had he been able-but he was too feeble to trace only a few lines, and those unfinished, entreating her kindness and protection for the motherless child of Beatrice, coupled With a request that she would visit him. After Mrs. King departed with her little charge, a load seemed lifted from the mind and from the heart of Sa- ville. He had now, as he thought, secured a home for his child when he should be no more-for Mrs. Lorraine had only to see Pauline to love her I I     .

Solemn thoughts moved him-' they were calm and peaceful, and his heart poured itself forth in prayer-then there came balm I from heaven. His eyes gently closed and he sank into a grateful sleep. "O, my dear papa!" cried Pauline, running in almost breathless with the speed with which she had flown up the stairs, "I am so glad to get back! how is papa tow?" stroking his damp brow with her little hand and klissing him,.  "Better, darling. And has my little girlhad a nicevisit? was the lady glad to see you, Pauline?"  "No indeed, papa I she would'nt- look at me, and she told them to take me out of her sight-It am sure I did not want to stay but there was such a dear young lady there-O papa, she looked like those beautiful pictures you used to paint, I mean those that had dear ma'ma'S face, only her hair was just as black, as black as, O ' I -don't know what--and ma'ma's was like mine, was it not, papa?"

"Who was that cross woman, papa?"    ' "Pauline, she is your grand-mother-your dear mother's mother." The child looked much astonished: "And who was that young lady?" "That I don't know, my child " ",Well, I wish she was my grand-mother " said the child, with a deep sigh. Mrs. King at this moment entered the room with a little bowl of oyster broth for the invalid. "Well, I have got back at last I how do you feel now? I have been gone longer than I thought, and after all said and done, I believe I have made a pretty bad busi- ness of it. I am afraid you have wanted your oysters before, for you did'nt eat a mite of breakfast." "I have io appetite, Mrs. King-you are very kind indeed. Will you tell me, if you please, about your visit?"  "Do tell papa about that nice young lady, won't you?" said Pauline. "I don't wonder you liked her, child," said Mrs. King; "she was the only decent person I saw there. I tell you, sir, I more than once wished myself and your little girl home again I first there was a great strapping man rigged out in a blue coat with yellow binding-well, he was for turning us right out of the house--but I was'nt going to be frightened away by such a scare-crow, I would have staid there iuntil a constable put me out, before I would have budged an inch without doing your errand, because    <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6462-00000143"/> 306  THE ' FORS AKE N   DAUGHTER.

She    seemed to feel sorry-like, and kissed Pauline two or three times, and said she guessed she would take her up stairs to her aunt. And then such a noise as there was in one of the rooms over-head-the door was open where I sat, and I reckon the one in the room above must have been ajar, for I could hear pretty plain, not, exactly what was said, but loud talking, and all at once there was a great uproar, and slam went the door, and such a skiting-I just peeped out to see what it was, and there was two or three women, an old negro among them, and my gentle- inman in yellow too, all running in every direction as if they had been shot-I declare I had to laugh! After a while the young lady came down with your little girl, sir,-she looked very pale and sorry-like, and the tears were in her eyes as she -told me, I could take the child away."

"Is there any thing else I can do for you, sir?" said Mrs. King, as she wiped her eyes with her apron,--"  must say, I have'nt been much pleased with this errand, but I am sure I shall not mind doing ten times worse jobs, if I can serve you and your little girl." "I thank you Mrs. King, there is nothing else you can do, only," here he hesitated, and then speaking a few words in Italian to the child, she kissed her father, and, left the room: "Mrs. King, you appear to take an interest in me and my poor child, and may God reward you for it. I fear I have not many days to live. I expected, or hoped rather, a different result from the service you have done me to- day,-it is past-and I must now arrange some other plan. And now my good kind friend, in case I am called hence, ere those arrangements are completed, can you, will you let my poor little girl stay with you until something is done for her?"

I have another dear friend to whom I shall write on the morrow. Let me not detain you longer. Will you send Pauline to me, and I will try and sleep.'  In a few moments the little girl came softly in, and sat down by- the bed-side. Her father took her little hand in his, and closing his eyes appeared to sleep.

"Do, if you please," said Amy, "tell him it is Miss  Lorraine." s In a moment a light step was heard on the stairs, and little Pauline came bounding in, and sprang upon Amy's lap:  "O I'm so, so glad you have come to see poor Papa "I she said, returning again and again the kisses of Amy. Old Sybil held out her hand:    , "Please jus come to me, little Missy, jus one little minit, and let old Sybil look at you child!"

"Did I nurse her I hear to de blessed child I ah dese ole arms hab toted her 'bout many's de time, and many's de time she hab slept on dis ole bosom!"

Commanding herself, however, Amy advanced to the bed-side, and placing her hand gently upon his, as it rest- ed on the quilt, said; "I hope you-are better, sir, this evening: my aunt is too unwell to come out-I have called to see if I can serve you?" Saville looked earnestly, almost eagerly upon her, as she was speaking. There was something about her, which reminded him so forcibly of his lost Beatrice, and yet how unlike the touch of her soft hand thrilled him-it seemed as if the presence of Beatrice pervaded his whole being: 19    <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6462-00000146"/> 812-  raIIE FRQSAKEN    DAUGHTER.

"Are your parents living?" "I believe not-no-that is--I believe my own father and mother are dead," replied Amy, much confused. Saville's doubts were dispelled. He no longer wondered at the strange influence which she had exerted ove. him -she was a part of Beatrice's selfl for he was now con- vinced that in this gentle girl, he saw her child-that child - which she had so mourned, and who now, by the inex- plicable workings of Providence, had come to soothe his last moments by her kindness and sympathy. An inex- pressible feeling of happiness followed this conviction- his child would not be alone It was evident, however, that Amy knew nothing of her parentage, and there might be reasons why she should not, and, although he longed to tell her of the near and dear tie which connected  her with his motherless child, he would not do it, lest he might cause her Some misfortune. He left the disclosure therefore unmade, trusting that in God's own time thhe se- cret would be revealed: "God bless you, Amy!" he said at length. "I conifide to you my poor little girl-you may have a nearer interest in her than you think for." Amy did not appear to notice this last remark, but re- turning the pressure of his hand, she said: "Indeed, I will do all I can, for I already love her very much-she is so lovely, so winning. I must go now, I believe," she continued, " for I have only my old nurse with me as a protector, and it is getting late. Can I tell my aunt any thing for you, when she gets better--I would not dare to speak to her upon the subject now."

Amy now extended her hand, which Saville pressed to his lips: "Farewell, Amy," he softly murmured. "Good night dear sir, I will try and see you to-mor- row!" To-morrow!  That morrow no more dawned on earth to Paul Saville. The sun which was then sinking beneath the horizon, to him ne'er rose again 1 Soon after Amy left, and after imprinting a last fond good night upon the lips of his unconscious child, Paul fell asleep--to awake in a brighter world.

But when -about nine in the morning Mrs. Lorraine awoke from the long sleep produced byy the opiate, which the physician had thought proper to recommend, her first in- quiry was for Amy. Whether from shame for the violent passion which she had manifested the day before, or from her own selfish caprice, she would scarcely allow her from her sight during the day. She carried this preference even to the prepara- tion of her gruel and medicines, a fact which, on the whole, gave some offence to Jane, who, never having had a rivral in those important items with her mistress before, now elongated her chin and drew her head back in the  .   .   ..    .

Before the hour when Dr. Page might be expected, Mrs. Lorraine signified her desire to be left alone with the mystic nymph. Amy was glad of an opportunity to see Sybil, who she knew must feel almost as anxious as herself.

Amy had left a poor, sallow looking woman beneath those silken curtains, with haggard features, and the pad- dle-track of time's crows about the edges.

She was in a half-recumbent position, sup- ported by pillows, whose trimmings were of the finest lace and cambric, and her hand sparkling with jewels, clasping a delicate handkerchief redolent with ottar of roses, rested upon the satin covering of the bed. 'How was it possible, think you, that Mrs. Lorraine could thus study appearances! could thus deck herself out in silks and gew-gaws! Did she not think of that fair and lovely little girl whom yesterday she had spurned from her feet and driven from her door! that innocent child bequeathed to her kindness with a mother's last tears and blessing, and a father's dying prayersl As she reclined under that silken banopy, did not the form of her little grand-child come before her-so friendless and so helpless I  Yes, she did think of her-that wretched woman I and the thought paled her cheek under the flush of the rouge. Concealed beneath those smiles, and the idle, nonsensical whims which exacted such close observance from those around her, was accusing conscience, which would not let her rest, although she seemed to rest from all care-save personal.   T HE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     819 All day Amy patiently waited upon her, now bathing, her temples, now running down into the kitchen herself to prepare her chocolate or gruel, to the great scandal of the cook--now reading, now talking, singing, doing every thing she could to please her, except by flattery. Yet all the while the patient girl thus read, or talked, or sang, her thoughts were in the sick room which she had visited yesterday-the image of the poor invalid and of sweet, little Pauline were constantly arising before her. The day wore tediously on and still it rained. The Park began to look delightfully fresh and green as it re- ceived the, grateful showers, and the foliage seemed to thicken and grow more beautiful under its influence. Amy's face, however, was as cloudy and sometimes as tearful as the weather. At any other Itime she would have rejoiced in watching the invigorating showers, and probably have enjoyed a few turns around the garden at full speed under the pelting drops,-a trick of her child- hood not yet overcome.  Daylight darkened. The street lamps were lighted, and as she sat by the bed-side of her aunt, Amy could hear thelsteady pattering of the rain against thewindows. Late in the evening she was permitted to retire, and with the hope that to-morrow would prove more propitious, she sought her pillow.                 U -The following morning Mrs. Lorraine was able, to set up, but she looked wretchedly even under that tasteful cap and the skillful hand of her maid. She was exceed. ingly irritable and nervous too, for she had passed 4 sleepless night. The sun rose bright and cloudless. The rain-drops yet lingered upon the shrubberies and sparkled as they caught its rays, while the birds, as if cheated into the be-    <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6462-00000150"/> 320  THE  FiO RSA,KEN   DAtGHT ER-. lief that they were still in their native groves, sang merrily as they darted in and out the foliage of the trees. But Amy was a prisoner in her aunt's room--there rwag nothing to have prevented her from leaving the house, but this constarit demand upon her time. She seized the first opportunity tol run up to the nur- sery resolving to send Sybil to inquire after those in whose welfare she was so much interested. But Sybil was not there. Supposing she had only gone down for a few moments, Amy waited patiently her return. She did not come, and upon looking in the closet she discovered that the old woman's bonnet and shawl were missing. "Dear old soul! she has anticipated my wishes," said Amy, "she has already gone-soon my anxiety will be relieved. I wish I had known when she went that I might have sent some flowers to Pauline--dear little soulr ,  She waited some time, but as Sybil did not come, went back to her aunt's room to find her in an exceeding bad humor at her absence, even for the little time she had been away.            .     .

In this way did Mrs. Lorraine miake herself and every one about her uncomfortable for the next four hours, un- til finally exhausted by her own petulence, she dropped to sleep in her chair.

"A little sorrowful deserted thing." HOOD. THE remains of Paul Saville had that afternoon been consigned to the grave. Far from the-chosen spot where, by the side of Beatrice, he would have lain him down, "life's fitful fever ended, he sleeps welll" Mrs. King appeared delighted to see Amy again, and told her that the little girl had asked for her many times. Pauline heard her voice, and running into the room, with a loud sob she threw herself upon her bosom, and began to' weep bitterly. Amy could only w74ep with her, and " fold her closely to her breast, as if she would hold her there forever.            f As soon as she had recovered a little from her agita- tion, she strove to comfort the bereaved child.

I know that," said the child sorrowfully, :" and that makes me cry more, for I am afraid they miss me--I wish they had taken me tool don't you think they miss me?" "They love you darling, and are watching over you, and some day Pauline, you will go and be with them," I said Amyi kissing her. "Yes, Ma'ma told me -so. O, I was such a little girl, but I can remember how she said she was going away from Pa'pa and me, and that if I was good, Pa'pa and Pauline should come to her-and I have always tried to be good." Much more such conversation did Amy and the little girl hold together, until Pauline seemed almost happy, as she sat upon her lap, looking up into the tender eyes bent so lovingly upon her, and listening to the gentle tones of her voice. But when Amy said that it was time for her -to go, then the grief of the child broke out afresh. She wept, she implored, she screamed with something of' Amy's old impassioned temper. Poor Amy knew not what to do-her heart ached for the sorrow of the little girl! she ^ strove to reason with .her, told her she would come and see her in the molhing, and that, perhaps Sybil would stasy all day, and tell her about her Ma'ma. But all would not do. /Amy still held her in her arms, and when she felt that little heart throbbing so violently, and saw her flushed cheek, and pitiful countenance, a spirit of the olden time was aroused: "Sybil, I shall do it!" she exclaimed resolutely.

The eyes brightened, a smile came to that little con- , vulsed mouth.     - "O yes! may I, may I go home and live with you l" Si ; she then seemed to remember the cruel treatment of Mrs. Lorraine, for her face grew very sorrowful: "Pa'pa said she-that cross lady was my grandmother-won't she hurt me?" "No, darling, she is sick, and you will not see .her to- night, and perhaps when she gets better, she will love you, and be very kind to you.

"You know best, I suppose, Miss Lorraine,"-she an- swered, " if the child will be happier there than here, I shall be very glad for her sake, tho' ,I am sure I would do any thing to please her.

"I can't help crying, Miss Lorraine-that child some- how makes me I she has gone to get a little bunch of poor faded violets, that stood on the stand by her Pa'pa's bed, when he died. I bought them in the market on purpose for him, because I think flowers always do a body good 1!" " + And has she gone up ito that lonesome room all alone?" said Amy. "I will follow her-shall I?" "If you please, Miss, but the room don't seem lonesome to her, for she has been in there most all the time, since her poor father died." Amy ran up stairs, and softly opened the door. There I she found little Pauline upon the desolate-bed-stead, hug- ging and kissing the pillow, which still bore the impress of her father's head, and talking to it softly in Italian; "I am ready," she said, springing down, as she saw Amy. "I was only saying -adieu to dear Pa'pa again!" She then went to the little stand which had been removed to:a corner of the room, and taking the violets which were now dry and withered, she placed them carefully in her bosom, and holding out her little hand to Amy, toge- ther they left the room of death. It: was almost dark when they reached St. John's Square. For a moment Amy's stout heart almost failed her, as she thought of her aunt's terrible anger, when she should find out what a bold step she had taken, and that -without her knowledge, she had dared to bring her grand- child home! However, if she could only manage to get Itu3'ne into the house, and up into the sanctum of Sybil, she felt secure for several days at least, forit was rarely any o  invade-d Sybil's retreat but herself, so that there could be but little danger of discovery, and in the mean time   THE  FO RSA KEN   A UG H TER.   329 she trusted she might prevail on her aunt to receive the orphan. The difficulty at present was how to get her into the house:  "Sybil, you and Pauline go under those trees," she said, "I will ring the bell and go in--then you come back to the steps, and I will watch my opportunity and let you into the house." This plan was acted on. Amy,went in and in a few moments admitted Sybil and the little girl. She then passed swiftly up the stairs, the old woman and Pauline closely following her. Just as they reached the last land- ing they encountered Jane, who had been sent with some errand to Sybil. Amy ran on, and Jane, casting a scruti- nizing look upon the child, with the bundle which Sybil slyly slipped into her hand, said: "Your Mistress has especial need of your attendance, Sybil-where have you been? and What little girl is that?"  I  "Here's a fuss! jus 'cause. I go out once in a dog's age! can't nebber go no whar widout being chritichized, and hab to tell who ebery little milliner gal is! don't let de tings fall child, come 'long-spose some folks tink " in a loud tone, as Jane retreated, "dat ole nig better bring home dere own tings--hil de imperance ob sorme folks be 'ston- ishing!" There was a large closet adjoining the nursery--a re- ceptacle for all manner of cast-a-way articles-old bon- nets, trunks, old dresses-coverless picture books, and headless dolls, the relics of Amy's childhood, together with vials of medicines which Sybil considered her par- tictlar province-salves which-would cure the eye-sight at a glance, and wonderful sticking plasters which- would    <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6462-00000155"/> 330  THE  FORSAKE   N DAUGHTER. call together scattered remains of broken crockery, and at the same time knit broken bones, and kill the head,- ache I In this closet then Amy immediately set to work-with her quick hands, and Sybil's willing heart, all the hetero- . geneous mass was called to order, the trunks were piled up on one side, a piece of carpet spread down, and a nice little bed made up for Pauline upon the floor. While these arrangements were in operation, the little girl sat down upon a small bench and watched the proceedings. It amused -her very much, and served to divert her thoughts from dwelling upon her great loss. Amy, dear girl, was in an unusual state of excitement. She knew she had done a daring act and must suffer the consequences--right or wrong, she could not decide, ex-. cept by her own impetuous feelings which cried aloud for iustice to the orphan I Thus incited she was exubberantly gay. Her eyes parkled, a rich bloom mantled her cheeks, her mouth was all smiles, her full, red lips parting only to display her beautiful, pearly teeth, and no artiste could have arranged her glossy, raven hair more becomingly than had the abandon of the moment. Her every step was as light as a zephyr-one moment flying to help Sy- bil, the next, catching Pauline by her little waist, she would whirl her lightly round, and then with a hearty kiss reseat her upon the little bench. Pauline once or twice laughed aloud, she could not help it, and then old Sybil would put up her finger and "She-e-e!" fearing her sweet, child-like voice might b9 heard in the halls. When all things were in order, Sybil went down stairs to see if she could not secure a little supper for the child   TH E   FORS AEN ' DA U GHTER.    331 Amy turned the key after her, and then sat down and took little Pauline in her arms. The head of the little girl nestled lovingly to her bosom, and her beautiful eyes looked up into Amy's with a sweet, confiding expression which made her heart grow strong. And thus strangely united, the orphaned sisters sat alone in their mother's play-room I The concerted cough of old Sybil gave warning of her approach, and Amy softly unlocked the door. The faith- ful soul had contrived to slip a nice, buttered roll, and some cake into her pocket, and in her hand she brought a small bowl of milk. "Jus as if I can't bring up ile bit of milk, widout dat ole cook crying ' Yah--yah-what's you gwine do wid dat, Syb?' 'spect I can take de milk out ob Misses Anne's kichen, widout asking you, when I'se got to tak de med- cinel"' Amy now left Pauline for a 'little while with the old nurse and went down stairs. She had not intended to se3 her aunt again until the next day, but she felt so much relieved by knowing that the- dear little girl was safe under the same roof with herself, that the resent-  ment which she had indulged toward her in the morning had passed away, and her more kind feelings now prompted her to visit her before she retired for the night. Mrs. Lorraine, exhausted by her irritability and her" stinging thoughts, was in bed with the curtains drawn closely around her. "How do you feel this evening, aunt?" said Amy. "You must be very anxious to know, no doubt I you are so sick, it seems, that you cannot stay with me, but you can go out and walk the streets 1"  <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6462-00000156"/> 332  TIE  FORSAKEN   DAUGHTER.

Mrs. Lorraine could not meet the justly indignant glance with which, "severe in. youthful beauty," Amy re- garded her, and with a peevish "Psha," turned away her head. "I ask you, aunt 1" repeated Amy. "I shall not reply to such iinsolence, Miss---but one thing I insist upon knowing-where have you been?" "Yes, I will tell you-you shall know!

AMY went to her aunt's room as usual in the morning,- she regretted that she had allowed herself to speak as she had done--she should have refrained from noticing even an insult from a sick, querulous woman. Thus felt our heroine as she approached the bed-side. There was no unusual excitement manifested upon Mrs. Lorraiie's coun- tenance, except that her eyes were more sunken and blood-shot. She received her as usual; -and by neither was any allusion made to the scene of the previous even- ing. Again were all her hours monopolized by her aunt's whims, and for several days she was scarc ely able to look i4 upon her dear little charge, who, however, seemed very happyin her seclusion with Sybil, listening to her stories, of which the old woman was a walking chronicler.

'R at night, Amy stole from. her own soft' bed to share little Pauline's hard couch tho' Sybii had managed to purloin '  from the attic several large pillows and blankets, with which she had greatly improved the little gitPs resting place. They both foraged successfully, and as it is said that "stolen fruits are sweetest," Pauline highly enjoyed her bill of fare both dainty and salutary. Mrs. Lorraine was soon able to ride out and resume her usual course of life. The time had come for Amy to speak. She -knew that her secret, which had several times narrowly escaped betrayal, could not much longer be concealed. She was fearful also that Pauline's health would suffer from such close confinement-the poor little child who had lived almost out of doors in her own na- tive Italy! Nor were these her only reasons-iG was her aunt's jus. tice she must demand.  - It was a severe ordeal-but strong in her sense of right and duty Amy shrank not.

"What is it? do you want to know about the trim, mings to your muslin?"         ^  "No, aunt, I have something else to say." "Well, you must be quick, for I have ordered the car- riage. I must go and see about our bonnets." "Will you dismiss Jane, aunt?

The next mo - ment. she fell forward fainting! upon the floor. Mrs. Lorraine summoned no assistance, but carefully loosening Amy's dress, bathed her hands and temples, and as she did so her tears dropped also upon the face of her grand-child. When Amy revived, it was to find her head resting upon her grand-mother's bosom. "Is it, indeed, so, am I really the child of Beatrice? was she my own dear mother? O, I am so happy I and Pauline, dear. little Pauline is my sister I my sister-no wonder I felt myself so strangely drawn toward her--my; sister-my dear little sister! and you, aunt, are my grand mother!" she added with a smile.           "Yes, Amy, I am your grand-mother," Mrs. Lorraine, replied affectionately kissing her. "Will you now tell me all that I have so long wished to know--O, I have waited and waited so pa- tiently!" "It will be a painful recital, Amy, for you' to hear, and for me to relate, for you will have to listen to your moe- ther's sins." "Spare her as much as you can," said Amy, softly. As the facts are already known to the reader, a recapi- tulation would be tedious. The facts, however, as Mrs.! Lorraine believed them to be, might be called falsehoods, I for, of course, her narrative received its coloring from Staunton's portraiture, placing Beatrice in the same light she had before represented her to Amy, and giving to Staunton the semblance of a fiend in human shape-and therein she was right. She dwelt slightly on the first marriage of her daughter, but glossed it over as smoothly   T I E F O R S A K F ?Nr ) A U G H T E R. 41 X and quickly as: possible, and in Amy's excited mind she then asked for no further particulars. She told her of her journey to the far-west when she believed Beatrice to be dying, and of her birth, and that, on account of her mother's feeble health, she had herself taken her andput ier to nurse in a most excellent family where she knew she would have tender care! She then told Amy of the subsequent insanity of her mother, andS elopement from the Asylum with her base lover to Italy!l which, of course, Mrs. Lorraine religiously believed to be a fact. She then went to her writing desk and unlocking it, drew forth from a secret aperture that base forgery of Staunton-that letter from Florence-and placed it in Amy's hand. "There Amy read that, as but one specimen of the in- suits which that man has heaped upon me!" Amy had listened to the narrative with breathless in- terest, now weeping, now beseeching her grand-mother not to speak so cruelly of the dead who could never in- jure her more. When the painful recital was ended, she buried her face in her hands, and strove to collect her agitated thoughts, land to review the past, while Mrs. Lorraine, exhausted and overcome by the scenes which the recital brought so vividly before her, lay upon the sofa with her face concealed in the folds of her shawl. At length Amy spoke: "Why did you take me to your protection? I am the child of your daughter, Pauline is also her child--why did you receive me under .your roof, and thrust her from it?"

Mrs. Lorraine laughed a bitter, scornful laugh: "Don't think to alarm me by these threats--they sound very formidable to be sure!

AMY selected a few of her plainest dresses, her choicest  books, her drawing materials, and one or two little arti-  cles upon which she placed great value, among them her "Amy clothes," which she had always carefully preserved, and packed them in a small trunk, to be left in charge of Sybil, until she could send for them. She shed no tear as she thus prepared to yield up to her sense of duty and sisterly affection, all the elegancies with which she was surrounded. Her closets and wardrobe contained the  ; most beautiful dresses, her jewel-case sparkled with its lrich treasures, diamonds, opals, and emeralds-and all these she was to cast frofn her, for, except one small ring which j her grandmother had presented her on'ly a few days pre- vious and which she now chose to retain as a last me- mento of her kindness, Amy would not take one of them away with her.

Her arrangements completed she went up to the nur- sery. As she opened the door Pauline sprang lo her arms with a joyful kiss. Oh how lovingly and tenderly did Amy press her to her bosom--her new-found darling sis- ter how easy seemed the path she had chosen, when she looked into that innocent smiling face I "Pauline you are not my cousin after all i" she sid, as she took the little girl upon her lap. "Am I not I O, I am so sorry, dear, dear Amy! but I can love you just as much as if you were my cousin, can't I?" "You may love me better, 'if you wish," said Amy, smiling, "' for you are my own dear little sister-your dear Ma'ma was my mother too." Pauline clapped her hands for joy. "And Pa'pa too?" "' No, darling, he was not my Pa'pa." "What a pity said the child, thoughtfully-" well never mind-I will let you love him halfl"  At this moment Sybil came in frbom the closet, and lift- ing Pauline from her lap, Amy told her she wished to speak with the oldl nurse alone, so the child ran into her little bed-room where she had already commenoed house- keeping with a family of broken down dolls. Amy then informed Sybil of all that had passed be- tween her and her grandmother, to which recital the old woman listened, sometimes with tears, with pious ejacula- tions, and sometimes it must be owned with rather strong language, when the conduct of her "Misses Anne" aroused    <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6462-00000164"/> 34S  THE  FORSAiEN    DAUGHTER'. her indignation. But when Amy announced her inteno tion of leaving the house, then she wept and scolded by turns.

"P'raps I will, and p'raps I won't I cry 1 I is'nt gwine cry-'spect I'll be in my grave 'fore long I does 1" and throwing her apron over her face the poor grieved old soul wept and sobbed unrestrainedly: "wDont weep so, dear Sybil-I want your comfort.

She tried to say more, but her voicefailec; and for some moments despite the comforting words, of her  young mistress she continued to weep. Then suddenly drying her eyes, she started up. - "Dere-now, Missy Amy, now  I'se ready to put dese, ole hands to de plow."       l In the few days that Pauline had been with her, AOmy had prepared a little simple mourning for the child. She had cut over for her a black silk dress of her own, which Sybil had made, and the latter had also gone out one evening, and bought her a little cottage straw, trimmed I  with a plain black ribbon. In these she now dressed her, and nothing could be more strikingly lovely than the contrast offered by the jetty hue of the little frock, and the white neck and arms of tl1 child, with her golden ecrls dancing to every step for which her joyful little heart made music, she was so hap- py that she was going away with her dear Amy. "Could she resist her now!' thought Amy, 1ooking with love upon her  little sister. "She has never seen her only that morning-perhaps she did not notice her pure and innocent face-but if she saw her now!" and then came the desire to lead Pauline to her grandmother's presence, and make one more appeal to her tenderness. Taking her by the hand she went down  stairs. Mrs. Lorraine knew the gentle knock: "  Ah, I thought so-she has come back, to teH m e sh* is sorry, and that she has changed her mind  yes, I   I           * '    <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6462-00000165"/> 350  THE  FORSAKEN   DAUGHTER. knew she would'nt go!" said Mrs. Lorraine, arousing from her gloomy meditations with a smile. But when Amy opened the door, and came forward leading little Pauline with so much calmness, yet with such an air of respect, she had no power to speak-she was dumb with astonishment. Amy advanced, and kneeling before her-with her little sister said: "Your grand-children have come to bid you farewell, if you say we must go." She pushed back Pauline's hair from her beautiful forehead and temples, as she spoke- look at this little girl, dear grandmother-won't you kiss her, and bid us stay and make you happy?" "Audacious girl!" exclaimed Mrs. Lorraine, springing from her seat, and with rapid steps crossing the room to the bell-rope. But Amy was at her side in an instant, and checked the movement. "Don't ring, grand-mother--don't suffer the servants to witness this scene. We will go--farewell, if we meet no more on earth, may we be6 united in heavenl come, Pauline." "Good bye, grand-mother," said the child, timidly. And hand in hand the orphans left her presence. Amy now put on her bonnet and shawl, and went up- stairs to say good bye to Sybil. She found her apparent- ly very busy in the closet, tying up a large bundle, and singing, at the same time, a methodist hymn at the very top of her voice.  "Well, Sybil, we have come to say good-bye-but what are you doing, I put all Pauline's things in the basket?" said Amy.

"Yes, I 'spect mebbe I'll come one ob dese odd days ob de year!" answered old Sybil, chuckling to herself and  breaking out with fresh power in her singing- For I hab sweet hopes of glory in my soul!"

The old nurse had been told by her Mistress that Beatrice fled with Staunton to Italy, and she believed it-her meeting with him at the Asylum, was confirmation enough I when then she looked upon the cold face of Paul Saville, she attributed the change she saw thereon to the effects of climate, of time, and protracted suffering. Both had black hair, and strongly marked fea- tures, and both were tall, and although, as she said, she should never have recognised him, if she had not known it to be Hubert Staunton, still she had not the least sus- picion that the insensible form before her was other than the man whom she so detested.

As her needle now busily threaded the seam, her-thoughts as busily flew to the little girl in whose welfare she took so much interest.

The door bell interrupted her cogitations, and as Biddy, her maid of all work, had asked leave of absence for an hour or two, Mrs. King herself answered the summons. To her surprise, no greater than her pleasure, (she opened the door to the very persons who had so much engaged her thoughts the last half hour, and as she clasped Pau- line in her arms, she exclaimed: "Well, if this is'nt the drollest thing-why I have done nothing but think about you all day! you don't know how I have missed you, you little Pussl It 'is real kind in you, Miss, to bring her here," she ontinued, as she preceded them up stars -" real kind-some people are so grand, they would never , have thought of letting her come here again."

She would have asked Mrs. King to take her into some other room, as she did not wish Pauline to hear all she had to say, but she saw by the little girl's sad face and tearful eye, that the scene had brought back her recent affliction pain- fully to her mind-so she would not leave her alone. Mrs. King had taken the child on her lap, and diving down into her capacious pocket, brought forth a fine sweet orange, and put in Pauline's hand,-she received it with a smile, but it remained untasted, and she rested her head sorrowfully upon the good woman's shoulder.

The gracious me! a room for Miss Lorraine--why what is it all!" she exclaimed. Amy made known to Mrs. King as much as she thought proper of the circumstances which led to her present ap- plication. She was a prudent girl, and therefore did not dwell upon any point which it did not concern her to be made acquainted with-but the penetration of her listener was as keen as a brier-she could read, where Amy thought all would be a blank, and then she folded the page,  that no eye but her's might rest upon it. "I am no great hand at making speeches," she said, as Amy concluded, "I know I can't say half I wan't to, but you must not think I don't appreciate all you have done --it is'nt always those that has the most to say, that feels the most I I do know you are a good young lady, and I am sure that God will never forsake the fatherless.

But, iustead of taking her into the small entry room, of which she had spoken, she led the way into a pleasant front charmber, where every thing wore an air of neatness and comfort. A carpet of home-spun manufacture co- Wered the cemtre of the floor, the bed looked tempting fram its ldeanliness, and the ,windows were shaded by half curtains of dimity, as white as snow.

"Why you told me you had only a small entry room, and I am sure this is a very airy pleasant chamber!" said Amy. "Why it don't make much difference you know, with old bachelors," replied Mrs. King, laughing-( "so I just made a change with Mr. Badger that's all, and put his* traps into the small room." "But what will he say!" said Amy, looking quite dis- tressed, "I ama sorry you have done this Mrs. King." ' Oh, you need'nt be-I dare say he will have gallantry enough to give up his room to a lady, for what does an L old bachelor want of a double room I if he don't like it  why he can leave." - Amy now removed Pauline's bonnet, and took off her own things, but while doing this, her land-lady was -all the time running in and out, now bringing in a sewing chair, then a little footstool, and by and by a small table made its ap- pearance, and one or two large conch-shells highly polished were placed on the mantle. Whether Mrs. King had robbed some other unfortunate bachelor boarder, of his superfluous luxuries, as she had the iother of superfluous room, remains to be told-yet their effect was to give a real cosy-like appearance to the apartment. "Now I must go and see about tea," said Mrs. King, bestowing an approving glance around the room, "Per- haps you don't care to go down to-night, I will ^send you and the little girl up something, for I guess you must be pretty tired." ,       q    <pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6462-00000171"/> 362  THE  FOR  AKEN    DAUGHTER. Amy thanked her for her kindness, and then going to the window, looked out upbn the scene. No pleasant Park, no beautiful trees waving in the sunlight, -and fresh green grass met her view-but black, smoky looking rehouses, with rusty iron shutters loomed opposite, their side walks heaped with bales and boxes--no elegant carriages, with their richly caparisoned steeds, passed be- neath her window-carts and market wagons thronged the dirty pavements instead: market boats and other small craft, crowded the dock, shutting out all view of the water, and the tall masts of vessels alike concealed the Jer- sey shore opposite-while to all these visual objects were attached their own significance of sound. The contrast offered was very striking, yet Amy did not falter. "I dare say we shall like this very much don't you, darling, when we get used -to it?" she said to little Pau- rlne, who stood by her side. "I like it now better than that house of grand- mother's, if Sybil was only herel" the little girl an- swered. "Poor, dear Sybil, how she will miss us, Pauline l" and the tears were in the eyes of Amy as she spoke. "She is so faithful, and so good-don't yoiL love her dearly?" "Yes, indeed, I do, sister Amyl and she was dear ma'ma's own nurse tool howI wish she could always'live with us-don't you?" "De Lord willen she allers will!" cried old Sybil, who had entered unperceived, and now throwing her arms about her "childen," she wept and laughed by turns.

MANY years have passed over the heads of Dr., Wood- ville and his estimable lady, since we watchede their de- parture from the Quay at Havre, homeward-bound, leaving behind them those they so dearly loved, to return orrow- ing to their own fair Florence. And yet upon the benevolent countenance of the, doc- tor, one could hardly detect their passage. Ilis hair,* perhaps, is more silvered, and there may be more furiowl upon his high, intellectual forehead, yet undimmed is that: eagle eye, his step has all the firmness and elastiocif d i youth, and his form is as erect as when first we met hihm by the sick couch of Beatrice.    <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6462-00000173"/> 366  THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.. More perceptible are the inroads of time upon Mrs Woodville. Her eye has faded and become dim, and white as the frosts of winter is the hair which is parted under her plain mob-cap, yelt really she has grown more lovely. There is such a sweet serenity, so much of Christian grace resting upon her features, her words are so gentle, her smile so cordial, and her good deeds so many that one cannot look upon her without veneration and love.  Hand-in hand are this dear old couple passing on to the grave as in bound upon some pleasant journey, which when ended, was to find them in " green pastures, beside the still waters." Earth is beautiful to them-they see no dark-clouds about this lovely world to make them im- patient for a brighter land. They are content to await God's own time, and so long as their pilgrimage shall last, strive to make this world the brighter and the better for their presence. There is work to do yet, altho' three score years have circled over them, nor will this work be finished until death gently stays their hands and checks the pulse of life! and whenever that moment comes, with holy, trustful faith and love, will they resign their souls to "Him who-gave, and who taketh away." It is now a long time since they have heard from Italy. The letter which would have broken to them' the death of Beatrice never reached them-the vessel which bore it foundered at sea, and from that time Saville never wrote again. Grown selfish and morbid, as we have seen, by his own affliction, he omitted a duty, and committed a most grievous fault. For day after day they looked for tidings, and when none came, they often felt aggrieved, and feared that t ie sin of ingratitude rested upon ithe fair soul of Beatrice. Yet each strove to drive the thought   I ^   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     367 from the breast of the other, for they would rather weep Paul and Beatrice as dead, than to believe them grown cold and ungrateful.  i   Dr. Woodville still has charge of the Asylum at D--, which retains its popularity, with him at the head, as being the first in the country. A very skillful and  scientific physician has the more immediate care of the patients', aXl except upon urgent cases is the venerable doctor called upon save for advice, altho' he never fails to go the rounds of the wards daily, for his presence always seems to be soothing even to the most miserable creature there. The scene I am   about to describe took place one evening in the early part of summer. It was one of those pleasant nights in June, when a delicious beauty and fragrance permeates the atmosphere, ere the sultry sun has scorched the breath of the flowers, or brought with it that sense of languor and oppressiveness which steals over one later in the season. Dr. Woodville was seated in the piazza, enjoying the pleasant breeze, and listening to the gentle rippling of the leaves which sounded like the waves of some tiny stream, washing its pebbly bed. 'He was leaning careless- ly back in his large arm chair, his white locks stirred by thesame wind which made: its pleasant music felt within his breast, and looking abroad with a smile of content up6n the mountains and the meadows stretched out before him. Mrs. Woodville sat by his side, still knitting, and for aught we know, upon the same endless round which occupied her under-the ship's awning. There was something in the scene which reminded them both of an evening many years before, when with Bea- trice they stood upon that same spot, and viewed the same    <pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6462-00000174"/> 368  THE  FORSAKEIN   DAUGHTER. glorious landscape which her i hand then sketched-and the very pirit of that hour seemed to have come back with the influence of the summer wind, the clear blue Heavens and the redolence of the atmosphere! And Beatrice never returned from that journey, which on the morrow she was to take I Her hand sketched scenes which her eyes were no more to see, except in the faithful lines of her pencil. That was indeed the eve of a long journey, from that pleasant home, where through the sympathy aad love of those who then, with saddened eyes, looked withheruponscenesthey were so soon to leave, life had once more assumed freshness and beauty. The doctor and Mrs. Woodville conversed together of that last evening, which was at the moment brought so vividly before them, and as they talked, they almost fancied the form of their beloved Beatrice hovered about them, and smiled upon them. Then they spoke of their pleasant life in Florence, and of the happiness which seemed so bright around the path of Paul, and his lovely wife-they spoke of Staunton and his crimes, of Mrs. Lor- raine and her bitterness. Thus the moments sped on, and the village clock pealed eight. The doctor was about to retire into the house, when casting his eye down the road, he saw the gig of Dr. Myers the acting physician coming rapidly toward the house. "Something is the matter my dear, there comes old Joseph in the doctor's gig, he makes the horse show his speed-I shall have to go down to the asylum I expect," said the doctor. As he spoke the gig stopped at the gate, and one of the most faithful of the keepers ran up the walk: ( Well, Joe, what is the matter 1?" called the doctor.   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.    869: "Doctor, you're wanted," sang out Joe-"they have just; brought in a real specimen of a wild catI it takes Bill and John, and all the rest of them to hold him, and Dr. Myers says, perhaps you're eye will fix him-if that don't, we shall have Bedlam in earnestl" "Poor fel-low!" exclaimed Mrs. Woodville, in her usual tone of sympathy for the insane,- "is he so very bad, Joseph?" "Bad-he could not be badder I why he knocked poor Mrs. Boyd over as she came in to ask the doctor about something, and I'll behanged if he did'nt go at the doctor himself, who had to catch up a chair and hold before him to fend him off why he has broken three ropes already--why he is a most awful critter, Mrs. Woodville!" The doctor had by this time changed his dressing gown for his coat, and shaking hands with his good wife, as was his invariable custom  whenever he was about to leaye her, if only for an hour, he mounted the gig, and was soon rolling rapidly in the direction of the Asylum. Arrived there, he proceeded immediately to the room in which the patients were usually received. As be opened the door, he saw a tall, gaunt man standing in the centre of the room, held by the strength oa three keepers, whose fl'shed faces and swollen mus- cles, denoted the power which they were folrced to use. "Well, Dr. Woodville," said Dr. Myers, " here is about the worst case we have had for two years. I thought you had better see him, for his cries are so outrageous that I feared their effect upon some of the other patients." /'Right, right," answered the doctor. /    <pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6462-00000175"/> 870  THE  FORSAKEN   DAUGHTER. He then walked up to the unhappy man, who was again writhing in the grip of his keepers, and fixing his eye steadily upon him, said: "Well, friend, how are you this evening? Peter, why don't you offer the gentleman a chair?" At the sound of his voice, the mad-man uttered a horri ble yell: "Ha! ha! ha! old man, so you have come to this too, have you?-good-ha! ha! ha! good! you are mad- she is mad-Beatrice is mad,' and I am mad too-all mad together-hurra! ha! ha ha!" Dr. Woodville started with horror, and gazed long and searchingly upon the poor wretch before him! could it be? yes it was! in that emaciated frame, in that haggard countenance, that blood-shot, frenzied eye, he recognized the form and features of-Hubert Staunton 1 "My God!" exclaimed Dr. Woodville, "the ways of! Providence are, indeed, mysterious and inscrutable! the wretch who left his helpless victim within these walls to die, is now himself a maniac! in the self-same room where, unpitying, he saw her gentle form given up to the rough hands of the keeper; he himself now writhes in torture! poor, poor wretch! Beatrice you are avenged-. his punishment is as great as his sins!" "Don't, you hear her calling me?" cried the maniac, striving to free himself-" don't look at me, Anna, with those eyes of fire! ha! ha-they have been: burning, and burning into me, until my heart is consumed! let me go, I say!" And here the poor wretch became so furious, that to prevent his cries from reaching the ears of the patients, he was gagged and carried to a grated cell in a remote quarter of the establishment. Here his head was shaved   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.    371 and a strait-waistcoat lashed upon him. Dr. Woodville administered such remedies as met the case, and left him to the surveillance of his keepers. Inexpressibly shocked, he returned to the room where he had left the persons under whose charge Staunton had been conveyed there. . They were four in number, apparently laboring men. To Dr. Woodville's inquiries they stated that they knew nothing about the man whom they had brought there-that for several days strange noises had been heard to issue from a piece of woods about three miles distant, to the great terror of women and children,--that these noises were different, sometimes loud yells and horrible screechings-again heavy groans, and shouts of wild laughter, and that finally the neighbors had turned out in a body to scour the woods, and ascer- tainl who and what it was whence these dreadful sounds' proceeded-some of the good women, they said, verily believed them to be the cries of the Devil himself I that after searching the whole day, they had finally found this man with matted hair and torn, dirty garments, curled up like some wild beast, and asleep among the underbrush. Three or four of the stoutest men cf the party pounced down upon him, and succeeded at length, tho' with great difficulty in confining him, and not knowing what else to do with him they had brought him there. Such was the recital to which Dr. Woodville listened with solemn awe. As that mysterious hand which wrote Belshazzer's doom upon the walls of his impious banquet hall, did he trace the justice of the Almighty thus meet ing out the punishment of that guilty, perjured soul! The doctor passed a sleepless night. He could not banish that miserable man from his thoughts-he was ever before him, and if for a moment slumber closed his    <pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6462-00000176"/> 372  THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER. eye-lids, the cries of Staunton seemed ringing in his ears, and he awoke with a shudder. Earlier the next morning than was his custom, he pro. ceeded to the Asylum, and visited the cell of the maniac.       . He found him apparently more quiet, although he was muttering to himself low and incoherent words, which to any one else but Dr. Woodville, would have had no meaning, yet to him they were terribly significant of the sins of that man's whole life. As soon as he saw the doc- tor he became calm, except for the wild, unsettled ex- pression of his sharp, black eye, flickering like some unholy flame under his searching gaze. "Do you know me, Mr. Staunton?" asked the doctor, taking his hand. A dreadful smile distorted his mouth as he replied: "/Certainly, doctor, we met once in Florence--Beatrice and- Hyou remember, ha-ha! Sorry tho' to find you here in a mad house! Sometimes they tell me I am mad I mad! ha--ha-ha-a good joke, doctor, for you and I-mad 1" And here he again burst forth with the most horrible cries and imprecations upon Dr. Woodville, upon Mrs. Lorraine and Beatrice-nor were theirs the only names which foamed from his lips, others mingled with them, denoting but too plainly that his crimes rested not :alone with them.  Finding that his presence always more or less excited the wretched man, Dr. Woodville kept aloof from him, carefully studying his case however through the reports of Dr. Myers, and employing all the means which his long experience could suggest for his restoration. But weeks and months passed on and there seemed no radical im-   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHRTTER.   373 prorement.

CHAPTER XLV. "The noblest mind the best contentment has." SPEVNOER. A WEEK sliped away, and during that time so much was accomplished by our heroine, that the days appeared to have quadrupled, not from their tediousness by any means, but because so much had been done, and because she already began to feel at home. In the first place she had met and been introduced to the five pairs of dreaded eyes which looked upon her from the several heads of Mrs. King's five boarders--that was a stake, which when "done, 'twere best done quickly"Amy thought, and therefore she had met 1 them all formally at breakfast the morning following her arrival.  I First there was Mr. Badger, whose cold, grey eyes were disposed to look with all the severity of an outraged bachelor, upon that'piece of woman-kind, who had in- vaded his territories, and compelled him .by force either to the Hall-bed-room, or the Hall-door--which--he had not yet decided. He sat at the head of the board, like a bear at the steak, growling and jerking his elbows. At his   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.    875 right sat Miss Minkins, a young lady with a freckled face and faint blue eyes, of the most affluent connections, and belonging to the highest classes of society, as she after- wards informed Amy, but from some unlucky shaping of Destiny, it had become her destiny to shape for others, and so went out every morning with a small roll of news- paper in her hand. Next to her was the burly, good natured captain of the fine sloop Dorothy, which plied semi-weekly between Coienties Slip and Stonington, and who always entered the, house with "ship-ahoy!" as a salutation to hiA landlady. His face was sea-burned, and his iron-grey hair stood up as stiff as if brushed by a , I north-easter, and bandolined with frost-his large, clear blue eye twinkled with fun, and Miss Minkins was his especial joke, Whose " la Captain!" was the unvarying re- frain to all his remarks. Oppote t the captain sat a fair widow-a sentimental lady, thin, shadowy-who al- ways protested that her heart was too full to eat, that her sighs and tears were the only food for widowed love which she could relish, and yet always contrived like a Christian, to support her frail frame, with two eggs, a generous piece of-steak, three slices of toast, and two cups of coffee. She came to the table with a sigh, and left it with a sigh,--the captain affirmed he always knew the moment when Mrs. Rueful left her chamber, because the breeze freshened! She was young, for she said so-and, although many grey hairs would intrude upon the sight, despite black crape bows and pomatum, she took pains to enlighten the ignorance of the company by assuring them that grey hairs were no iindication of age-that grey hairs run in families. And lastly, opposite to Amy sat a wild-eyed, cadaverous, hook-nosed youth, Miss Minkins thought from his Byron collar, that he must be a poet-he might 23^         I    <pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6462-00000178"/> 376  THE  FORSAKEN   DAUGHTER. have been: forhis eyes, like "poor Jack's," were always "Iooking aloft," and he had a habit of running his long fingers through his hair, as if scratching up ideas from their yet undiscovered depths-his occupation was a mystery-he was always met on the stairs making a rush either up or down, as if about to do some desperate deed, but when the street door closed after him, no one knew what became of him-he suddenly disappeared as if the earth had taken him in. So much for those whom Amy was called upon to meet three times each day at meals. When she had unpacked her trunk, and she could not do it without tears, as she thought of her grand-mother- and had arranged her books, her drawings, and other little things about the room, they imparted at once an "at home" air which was inexpressibly pleasant to her. Mrs. King had succeeded in engaging some plain-sewing from a lady up town, upon which Amy set to work with an alacrity and cheerfulness proportionate to her good intentions-so does the consciousness of doing right make even a hard task easy I Ere the sun rose, she sat at her work, her busy needle swiftly accomplishing its task, and at night, until the city clocks chimed " twelve"-and the lugubrious cry of the watchman proclaimed "all's well," did Amy still continue her task, and then- "Her gentle limbs did she undress, And lay down in her loveliness." \ - Little Pauline in the meani time flew around the room, and up and down the stairs like a bright-winged singing- bird. Amy could not have felt lonely with her near. The little girl seemed very happy. This sweet union 16 little girl seeme   TIE  FORSAKEN   DA UGHTER.     " with a new-found sister, had very much softened her grief for her dear father, she never spoke of him, it, is true, without a tear welling up to her beautiful eyes, yet with the elasticity of childhood, "the tear forgot as soon as shed," she would the next moment be singing to Amy some sweet little verse which she had sang to papa in the flight of a bird in the wild wood-that she had no idea of any order or system, and that for her future good she must at once commence a task which she trusted the affection of Pauline would render a pleasant one, so after the first few days, she drew up her plan something after the fashion of her dear old governess, Mrs. Bowe, and gave little Pauline her daily tasks and lessons. She soon saw that sister Amy was in earnest, and after one or two attempts to free herself fromthe silken, tho' strong fetters which stayed her flight, she meekly folded her wings and sat down, still singing. Perhaps old Sybil was the happiest of the party-she certainly felt the most important. She had managed to impress Mrs. King with a sense of her superior tact in the concocting of soups and other condiments, and could prepare, the most palatable and at the same time the most economical cakes and puddings, and in a short time, partly by sounding her own trumpet, she maintained a pretty fair sway in the kitchen. Then she would tell Mrs. King that there was no work she loved so well as to iron shirts and dickeys, and would, therefore, take her stand at the ironing board-in short, Sybli was deter-' ined to work her way clear-she had agreed upon it- and Mrs. King never saw any reason to repent of her bar- gain.

When she had finished whatever house-work she felt it her duty to perform, then she would go up stairs, put on a clean apron and stiff bright turban, and sit down with her children. She was a beautiful seamstress too, and of- ten insisted on helping Amy, and many) a time she would watch her opportunity, and slyly steal a piece of work from her basket, and take it up to her own little attic room, where may be she would sit up half the night to finish it, and then in the morning when Amy went to her work-basket, she would find that the Brownies had been busy-but she knew who her Brownie wasl Finally, Sybil told her, she thought it was the " dreffulest nonsensical," for herto be sewing away on such common work-she had better be doing something prettier, such as embroidery or draw- ing, for which she would be paid as much again, as for such plain common stuff-she could do that sort of work herself, she said, for she had plenty of time Amy took her advice-only she told Sybil she never would consent to her doing the sewing-she must not confine herself so closely after being in the kitchen all the morning. Sybil yielded to her arguments very lamb-like, and then went down stairs, and bargained with Mrs. King to engage for her the work which Amy was to reject, and thus, without the knowledge of her young Mistress, she was accumulating a snug little sum to add to their hoard. The drawings of Amy, and her little fancy articles, proved much more lucrative than her former employment, and found quite a ready sale. Sybil, however, sagely sug- gested that these proofs of Amy's industry and taste   THE  FORSAIKEN    DAU G TER.   879 would be much more likely to find purchasers with many who would not buy them at a store for the extravagance of the thing, but would fancy if they purchased them -at their own door, that they were getting them much cheap- er-making a real bargain I So she coaxed her young  Mistress to let her undertake the sale. The things were all arranged very tastefully in an open basket, and proud of her enterprise, Sybil, leading little Pauline, who had entreated to go, with one hand, and taking the basket in the other, set forth upon her expedi- tion. Many eyes were turned with curiosity upon the old woman's vendibles as she pursued her way up Beekman street, but they rested longer upon the beautiful child she led by the hand. Many of the richest cltizens at that time resided in that quarter of the city, Where she chose" "  to offer her goods-they passed on, however from house to house, finding much praise, but few customers, until old Sybil got quite angry, and with a toss of herheadl de- clared : f' Dere was no 'spectable ladies ob taste in de hull city ob New York!" She then crossed with her youhg charge to Vesey street. As they were passing the studio of a celebrated Artist, Pauline entreated Sybil to take her in. She was extremely fond of paintings, and after some hesitation, the old wo- man finally complied with the request of the little girl The artist sat at his easel: "What do you wish my good woman?" he said, care lessly looking around. Sybil made her very lowest courtesy, and in her choicest language, informed him that the little girl was very fond i       gr       I ,          I I    <pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6462-00000180"/> 380  THE   FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER. of pictures, and asked his permission to look at the very 'bootiful specimens 1" Engaged with his subject, which was a large figure- piece, he scarcely heeded what she said, but gave her li- berty to walk around the room, only stipulating that she must be very careful not to touch the paintings. The eyes of little Pauline sparkled with pleasure, as she passed from picture to picture--when, suddenly she paused, and full of the associations which the scene called up, she asked Sybil if she did not think it would be nice, if she could earn some money like sister Amy. The old woman laughed to herself: "Hear to de little critter bless her heart I yes, it would be berry nice Missy P'line-'cause you knows de little ant's alters is busy I high I you tink you can arn a penny to buy de stick ob nice candy eh?" "I don't know"--said Pauline, thoughtfully, "but I re- member how Madeline used to come to Abpa, and I don't see why I can't l" so saying she rapidly threw off her bon net, shook back her glossy curls,I and ere Sybil could stop her she stood before the artist. "Do you want a model, Signor?" she asked in soft Italian. Then immediately placed herself in an attitude which she had often seen Madeline assume. Her beauti- ful eyes were lifted to Heaven, her fair arms raised as it to welcome some glorious visitant, upon whom those eyes were resting, her sweet face was glowing with excitement, and her small symmetrical figure poised with bewitching grace upon one little foot, as if about to spring upward-- the whole attitude, the face, the air, the meaning, were all inexpressibly captivating. The artist was taken completely by -surprise. He dropped his pencil and gazed upon the beautiful vision   THE FORSAKEN      DAUGHTER.    881 unable to speak-but even while he gazed, the little girl resumed her natural look and manner, and with artless naivete repeated the question: "Do you want a model, Signor?" "Were you sent here by Heaven, you charming child?"' he asked still taking in her loveliness. "No, Signor, I came with Sybil," Pauline answered. "I do want a model, my dear little girl, such a lovely one as you are I I will sketch you this moment." Pauline was perfectly delighted-her face all radiant with! smiles, she laughed, she clapped her hands, and danced around like a fairy, as she saw him preparing his canvass. But here wise old Sybil interfered, and despite all the child's entreaties and her tears, she would not suffer her as she said, " to hab her picter tooked." The artist too added his persuasions, even to the dis- ' play of a gold'piece. He assured her he had long wished for such a sweet face and form-that he wanted to intro- duce her as an angel, into a large grouping he had de- signed from Scripture, but Sybil shook her head solemnly, and said, "my little Missy mustn't be in de company of deam good 'postles and peoples, until one ob dese days when mebbe de Lord will put her derel" He asked her where she lived, but Sybil did'nt "lib just nowhere 'ticklar 'long shore, and round!"Would she bring the littte girl to see him again. Sybil made another most respectful courtesy, and holding Pauline tightly by the hand as she withdrew, said, "You'se berry obligatory--p'raps I will, and p'raps I won't." m Thus ended little Pauline' first and last attempt at modelizing, as also, poor old Sybil's peddling expeditions --their golden hopes dashed to the earth. f     <pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6462-00000181"/> 382   THE  FOR"BS A  N   DAUGHTER.

The faint wind which swept vp the street, had lost the purity and fragrance with which it had first laden its wings afar, and now, tainted with garbage and the noxious vapor from the reeking sewer, sickened the senses and stole to the seat of life. How like many a fair and promising youth who leaves. his peiceful home in some secluded vale, and buoyed with hope seeks the city's din-how like that breeze he too soon becomes corrupted and impure-loses all the bright promises of glorious youth, and buries his hopes of manhood in the seething caldron of vice fed by a thousand streams I This was to have been Amy's first summer at Sara- toga I how different was her young life passing now yet among all that fair and lovely group that clustered around   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     383 health's bubbling fountain, or circled in the mazy dance I to strains of delicious music, there beat not a heart more i   pure, more free from all selfishness, than that which pulsated in the bosom of our Amy, as in the close limits of her sultry chamber she cheerfully and dili- gently busied her fingers for the little charge who sat by her side. She had already won for herself a place in the hearts around her. Even Mr. Badger not only smiled gracious- ly, but with an admiration which seriously threatened his Behnedict-ine vows! he was even gallant, and daily offered her the " first fruits of the season," springing to the market boats almost before they touched the dock, to choose for Amy the freshest and fairest of their freight. True, he never meant to marry-marry, not he I but if ever he should be for-sworn, if ever. he should commit such an absurdity, Amy was the sorceress who would compel him to the deed--this he did not intend you or I, reader, to know-he merely confessed it. to himself one night after he had kicked poor pussy from the room, for he was almost distracted, and could not bear such felines. The good natured captain, too, would sometimes tap at her door with " ship-ahoy!" and put into her hands for herself and Pauline a little basket of ripe, ruby currants resting so temptingly in their 'bright, green leaves, and which he had brought on purpose for her from Stoning- ton, and, one day, astonished her by an offering of green peas and two summer squashes I The wild-eyed youth looked more wild, and scratched more intently, and one night rushed past Amy in the- hall, and, as if aiming a deadly blow at her heart, thrust at her a rol' of white paper, which proyed to be' erses-frenzied words set to  - I.,                   <pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6462-00000182"/> 384  THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER. rhyme-so darkly sublime and mystical, as if inspired by the mews of night. Our fortunate heroine also passed unscathed the ordeal of Mrs. Rueful's penetrating glances, and having been called in one day to the toilette of the fair widow, who in the very deepest of black, with sighs and groans was to be victimized to a pleasurable pic-nic, and having, by sorhe cunning trick of her little fingers, contrived a shelter for the hairs that would not mourn with her, from that moment she was as a "jewel in an Ethiop's ear" to the widow-only she was so robust, and would eat with so much appetite! how could she but then she had never lost her bosom companion,-as she told Mrs. King one night, while forcing down her nine o'clock supper of two dozen oysters and a bottle of ale I Poor little Miss Minkins, now almost a shadowy shape, worshipped Amy, for when she would come-in from her day's work, looking so pale and worn, and with, perhaps, some unfinished garment in her hand, which necessity compelled her to complete, Amy would take the poor, jaded young girl into her own more airy chamber, and help her on with the tedious work.  The sultry summer advanced, grdwing more and more oppressive as the dog-days drew n6ar, and sickness and death were all around. Little Pauline bega4 to droop like some fair flower transplanted to ungenial climes. She was never a robust, hearty child- she was always delicate, and her color never deepened beyond the faintest tinge of the rose-but now even that faded out, leaving only the lily. Her light step grew languid, and more seldom was her merry little voice heard abol t the house. Poor Amy's heart sank within her as she Watched the change, and she wept aloud when she remembered the beautiful   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     885 groves at Lorraine Park, its birds and flowers, and more than all, the fresh, grateful wind,; so balmly and sweet which wafted up from the Hudson.

What could she do for Pauline I she had no where. to go I she thought of Dr. Woodville, whose address she had taken down from the lips of Saville-should she write to him I Then there came a longing desire for the home of her childhood-could she but find her way to Leslie Farm I then, then would they be happy and safe But she did hot know even in what direction to look for that haven of refuge. "Sybil, dear Sybil!" she asked, ': an't you recollect? did you never hear grand-mother say where it was?"

Perhaps he was still at the same store, and yet when she remembered the years which had flown, since that accidental meeting, her heart sank within her she was then only ten, and now, in two months more, she would be eighteen I Then the street and the store, were involved in a laby- rinth of other streets and stores! she could give no clue either to identify the place-she only remembered turn- ing out of Broadway into a long narrow street, and that there she found her dear Harry! She made her perplexity known to Mrs. King, who un- dertook to look up her friend, if he was to be found with- in the limits of New York city. The narrow street which Amy had described, she plac ed her finger upon as Pine street, and accordingly sallied forth from Coienties slip, one of the hottest mornings in July, upon her rather Quixotic errand, it was, she said, like looking for a needle in a bot- tle of hay! Up one side, and down the other of Pine street, did the good lady prosecut her search, inquiring at every store, if Mr. Gorden was in, and if that was his place of busi- ifess. Some answered her gruffly, that they knew no such person, and not a few of the gay, frolicsome clerks were disposed to have a joke at her expense. By a most for- tunate chance, she at length did enter the very store which for several years after Amy had there met her friend, flourished under the firm of Yates, .Gorden &amp; Co., and was now managed by one of the junior partners of the old house. This gentleman happened to be at his desk, and hearing the name of Gorden, and noticing the anx- ious looks of the questioner, he came forward.

As her pen traced the page, the visions of her childhood brightened and freshened to her mind. Once more she was a little girl, and forgetting the changes which time must have wrought in both, she wrote to Harry with the same child-like trusting confidence, that she would have done six years before. It was not until after her letter had gone, that she be gan to look upon the dark side of the picture, which her hopes had sketched of the old Farm House, and those who dwelt there! did they still dwell there! or had the farm passed into the hands of strangers, and those she loved- where? perhaps dead. But Amy was not one to dwell upon the dark side of life--she was always for the sun- shine. Her heart basked gratefully in its rays, while they played about her path, and when the storm-clouds shut them in,--then she looked upward for light, and found that "every cloud had its silver lining." A week passed, and one morning early, there came. a quick ring at the door. A manly step sounded through the hall, and up the stairs into Mrs. King's little parlor, and then Biddy brought her a card: "He has comeI Harry has comel" exclaimed Amy, casting aside her work, and springing lightly down stairs.        - Her face radiant with joy, she flew into the parlor with outstretched hands, and then -- suddenly stopped, blushing, confused, and,ashamedl for in the centre of the room stood a stranger-a fine looking man, tall, robust in frame, and his dark brown locks already slightly sil- vered.

"Amy!" said the stranger opening his arms and ad-   vancing. She gave a joyful sob, half laugh, and half cry, and meeting them, they closed about her as lovingly as of  old. Then Amy withdrew herself, blushing, from them. "And you did not know Harry, after all!" said Gor- den, holding her off from him, and looking upon her with the same tender expression as in her childhood. "No, I did not at first,-but your voice, your eyes, O now I know you! Should you have known me?" con- tinued Amy, as hand in hand they still stood in the cen-  tre of the room, as if there were no such things as i chairs. "Do you think I could ever forget you, my little pet? why Amy, I really believe I should have known you, if I had passed you in the most crowded part of Broadway I should'nt have wanted but one good look at your bright face I that would have been enough. But you did not expect to see almost an old man-a gray-headed bachelor did you?" "Well, not exactly," answered Amy, smiling-"I did- expect to see a younger man--I did not think you could Lave gray hairs! but I think," she said, as she took a long look at his pleasant face, and met the pressure of his lips, as he drew her to him, "yes, I think I shall love you bet- ter.

But before returning to the parlor, she flew  i down into the kitchen, and clasping old Sybil's arm, as she held aloft a shirt of Mr. Badger's which she was about to place in glossy folds upon the clothes-horse, almost  i breathless with excitement, she said: "Dear Sybil, only think, Harry has come--Harry is up stairs "  "De ole Harry he be!" exclaimed Sybil, "I 'clare if I ant gwine right off de handle dis minit! hi!" giving the shirt a toss which sent it over the horse upon the floor-- hi-'pears as if I wer in de glorifications for sure! now jus look dere--see what I'se done! poor ole bach-'spect he'd roll up dem great white eyes ob his-en, if he see ole nig tossing 'bout his shirts after dis fashun!" and in the exuberance of her joy she caught it up and gave it another toss,--then taking her iron she smoothed out the folds anew. In the mean time Amy had returned to the parlor, and seated by the side of her true friend,' with'her hand clasped in his, she artlessly related her touching story. She was not allowed to pro'ceed, however, without many interruptions. The impetuous Gorden could not listen   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.    393 quietly to such a tale of wrong! now he would start up, and with his large hand tightly closed, fight the air as he walked the room, heaping mentally all kinds of anathemas upon the head of Mrs. Lorraine--the next moment he iwould clasp both Amy's hands, and while the big tear i stole down his cheeks, call her the bravest, the best girl in the world! When she told him of old Sybil's faith- ful affection, how she had left all the comforts of home to follow her fortunes, and was even now working beyond her strength for her and her little sister, then Gorden said her portrait should be taken and framed in gold, and that he would have it hung in the best room in his house.            - "And now bring your little sister to me, Amy," he said, as she concluded her narrative, i" bring her to me, and let me see if she is worthy to possess such a sister as -you!" Little Pauline never looked more lovely than when Amy led,her into the presence of Gorden. The happi- ness she saw on her sister's countenance mirrored itself on her own bright face, and as his eye fell upon her, his first thought was of some beautiful angel come down from heaven-his next, that she was a poor little child of earth, without father or mother, and forsaken by all but the dear girl whose hand she held, and he received her with open arms. to his heart, and kissing her innocent brow, he vowed never to forsake her.

At this moment old Sybil began to cough, and make  other very significant noises for Amy's interpretation, as she passed through the hall on her way up stairs. Amy knew the good creature wished to rejoice with her. "Here is Sybil-shall I ask her in?" she said. Pauline sprang off Gorden's lap, and running to the door, signified to Sybil that she mUit come in. As her bright plaid turban loomed in the dark passage way, Gorden arose from the sofa, and with as much respect, as if about to salute some royal queen, advanced i with a low bow to meet her. Sybil was not to be outdone in politeness. Seeing the respect with which Gorden made his salutation, she spread out her dress, and made a most profound courtesy, saying, as she slowly straightened herself back: "I'se most happy, Massa Harry, to hab de honor ob seeing you--I hopes you is in de full edification of heal', and I bless de Lord dat he hab sent you to be de salwa- tion ob Missy Amy and little Missy P'line!" and this speech was ended with another low obeisance.

Sybil followed, in the most dignified manner receiving the adieus and good wishes of Mrs. King and the boarders, making several low bows and courtesies as she descended the steps, and waving her hand graciously to Biddy whose head protruded from the cellar door. i! farewell good-by Hgood-by I good-by!" echoed back from the carriage as it disappeared around the corner: 4'A very interesting young man-that Mr. Gorden I he reminds me so much of my poor dear Rueful," said the widow. :: Young man! why, zounds Madam, his iigure-head is nearly as gray as mine!"

The bright blue Heaven unclouded and serene bends over them, on either side green swelling banks fringed with shrubberies greet their sight, and the soft wind laden with fragrance fans their grateful cheeks. Leaning on Gorden's arm, Amy walked the deck, so buoyant in her happiness, with a step so free and a heart   THE  FORSAKEN    DA UGHTER.    399 so glad, as if she could have soared away upon the invig- orating breeze which swept around them. Sybil and 1 Pauline were seated under an awning on the forward deck, enjoying the pleasure of the hour, especially the little girl. There was much in the scene to remind her of her own native Italy, and as the boat continued on its beautiful track, Pauline looked upon the lovely shores of the Hud- son, and thought of the many fair villas which sprinkled i the bjanks of the Arno. Suddenly Amy paused in her walk, and fastened her eyes with a saddened expression upon the opposite shore. A spacious lawn swept down to the river bank, dotted with clumps of foliage-cool and shady were the long avenues which darkened and deepened as the eye traced their wind- ings up to the noble mansion, whose turrets rose above the sea of verdure: "See Harry-there is Lorraine Park!" She looked at Sythil-the old woman pointed signifi- cantly to the charming spot, and then Amy saw her wipe her eyes and turn her head sorrowfully away. l They passed the night at Albany, and ere the sun rose thnext morning the happy party were 'on their route. A tight mist hung over the landscape, the grass and the wild flowers which skirted the road-side, shimmered with dew-drops, and here and there lay gossamer vails which the fairies had carelessly dropped by moon-light. The birds made vocal the air with their matinr hymns, and the wind laughed and played with them in the branches of the trees where their nests were hidden-cattle were low- ing in the barn-yards, sheep were frolicking upon the hill- side's, and bare-footed boys with merry glee were driving the cows to pasture, each with her tinkling bell browsing as she went. Then up rose the jolly sun, looking flushed I    ,                   .    ,    <pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC6462-00000190"/> 400   THE   FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER. as from a Bacchante feast, and shaking off the rosy arms of morning, hied him to his glorious course-away float. ed the misty vail, fold after fold disappearing, the moun- tain tops made bare their summits, and the river gleamed darkly blue and beautiful, as the eye traced its windings, specked by the white wings of gliding vessels. Nature wore a face of gladness, but not more so than those which were now dwelling upon her loveliness: "Look, dear Harry," said Amy, as her heart rose in gratitude to her lips, and pointing to the wide-spread landscape:.  "Thou visitest the earth and blessest it, thou makes- it very plenteous. The folds shall be full of sheep, the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn, that they shall laugh and sing."                     i It seemed to Amy, that little Pauline already began to improve. As the carriage 'rolled along the shady forest road her little voice echoed merrily through its depths, and now and then she would be lifted in the arms of Gor- den to some little nook all glowing with wild flowers, and there while the horses breathed, Gorden and Amy would pluck from the vines which trailed over the old stamps and lichened rocks, the luscious black-berry, to allay her thirst, and old Sybil wandering off to a safe distance among the trees would sing softly to herself her fayorite hymns. These scenes reminded Amy so much of her childhood, when with their little baskets in their hands, she and Bes- sie would search the wild wood and the meadow, for the first ripe berries--ften too, Harry himself led them the ! way to some distant field, where they grew in greater pro i fusion, and helped to fill their baskets with the juicy fruit, and now with him again at her side, Amy felt once l   THE  F  R S A K E N D A G H T E R. 401 more like a child. Gorden watched her animated coun- tenance with delight, and forgetting that he was no lon- ger to look upon her as his " little Amyl" but as a "brave young woman," he several times caught himself as of old crying out, " you dear little pet you!"-" you lamb- kin!"' at which both Amy and Pauline would laugh mer- rily. On the evening of the third, day from leaving New York, our travellers drew near to- Auburn, and Amy's heart fluttered as it had never done before-so near, so very near to the dear old farm. "You will not go to the old farm-house to night, Amy." "Dear Harry, why not?" "Because I have taken it into my head that you shall all go home with me, and in the morning, Amy, you must go over by yourself, and see, if they will recollect you. The sun is almost down you see--before we could reach the farm, it would be quite late, and as Bessie and her lit- tle ones are there, why Mrs. Leslie might not be able to fold all her lambs to her mind." "'Specially if one ob dem be black, Massa Harry!" ad- ded Sybil, with one of her silent laughs.       I For a minute Amy looked a little disappointed-she then said cheerfully: J "Well, Harry, you know best-yes, I really like your plan it might as you say, put mother to some'inconve- nience, and it will be so delightful too to take them all by surprise.

"That's just the way you'll do pet!" 'i' But, perhaps, it will not be convenient for you to re- ceive such an addition to your family." "I keep bachelor's hall you know, Amy-plenty of room." "Not for woman-kind," she replied archly. "When I receive you dear girl beneath my roof, I shall think I entertain 'an angel,' but not ' unawares,' "-was Gorden's answer. "There is Auburn," he continued as,  the carriage now reached the summit of a long hill, point- ing to the gilded spires and clustering roofs of a beauti- ful town. Amy looked with astonishment. Could that be Au- burn! One of the pictures, tho' very dim, which her memory still retained, was of Auburn-but it was of a small vil- lage, with a few white houses and flaming red roofs-of a store, which to her childish view, was a perfect Eldorado, in its heterogeneous assortment-of the tavern which stood at the corner of the four roads, with its creaking sign- board, bearing George Washington in a cocked hat upon the one side, and a rampant quadruped supposed to be -a horse upon the other, significant of entertainment for man and beast, and which always reminded her as she gazed upon it of Haman on the high gallows, as he appeared in mother's bible! such was the -Auburn she remembered, and now when Gorden pointed to yon populous and lovely town, she could scarcely realize the change. Swiftly the carriage rolled over the pavements of the principal street, Amy looking in vain from the window for those objects of her childish admiration, and then out again once more into the open fields, and along the mar ** ?

"What a beautiful situation!" exclaimed our heroine, as her eye followed the windings of a carriagelroad, which, under the inter-lacing branches of graceful elms and sycamores, led up to a cheerful looking dwelling, rest-, ing on a gentle slope, as green and as fresh as the first tints of spring.  "You think so?" said Gorden, with a bright smile, as at the moment the carriage passed through a large gate-way and bowled rapidly beneath those shady trees. "Why, where are we going?" asked Amy, surprised. "Home, Amy-this is the bachelor's roost, and it shall be your home pet, and yours little cowslip, and yours too, O Sybil." At the sound of wheels, a little negro, who was bal- ancing himself upon the fence, was seen to turn 'a somer- set, and make a rush for the barn-yard, crying out: "Master-Master has come!" A movement which was followed instanter by the ap- pearance of two stout Irishmen at the bars, with a run- ning accompaniment of "mongrel, puppy, whelp, I and houdd," who with joyful clamor, leaped around their mas. ter, as he sprang from the carriage. A pleasant looking old lady now came to the door, and welcoming her'nephew and his guests' with great cordial- ity, led the way to a cosy little sitting-room, while Gor- den lingered a moment upon the piazza to give some di- rections to his men. A most tempting supper for the travellers-fish fresh from the bosom of the lake, chickens who had yielded    <pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6462-00000192"/> 404   THE , ORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.[ their heads to tie block in honor of the occasion, with other grateful viands, were soon placed upon the table, which was waited upon by the grinning little black-boy, who in a clean white apron stood behind his master's chair,  his great white eyes forever rolling round upon the sun- ny head of Pauline. After tea, Gorden and Amy strolled out into the grove, and along the lake-shore, while little Pauline, weary but full of joy, sank to sleep in the pleasantest of moon-lit chambers, and old Sybil sat by her side, and glorified in Psalms and thanksgivings. Returning to the house, Gorden led the way into a pret- tily furnished parlor, where his aunt sat reading by the shaded argand. A piano caught Amy's eye,-she had not touched one, since she left her grandmother. "A piano--how delightful!"7 she exclaimed, running her fingers joyfully over the keys, to test its tone, and then gliding gracefully into a brilliant overture. Gorden listened delighted. "But who plays? do you, Mrs. Gray? do you? to Gor- den. IThe old lady smiled, and shook her head. "Harry is the only musician here, my dear," she said. Amy sprang up and seizing Gorden by both hands: "And you play? that is so pleasant-come Harry do let me hear you!" "Not until you have sung for me-you can sing, I know, for I have heard you.'" "Heard me.? when?" "No matter now, pet." He had never told her how of- ten he had listened to her voice under the shelter of those told trees by the Park.                 @ Amy began a plaintive little air which she considered one of her gems, but ere she had finished the first stanza,             l.

(' What a splendid touch you have, Harry-how finely you playl" said Amy, leaning over his shoulder. Again Gorden placed the happy girl at the instrument, and their blended voices made pleasant music in the Bachelor's roost. Eleven! chimed the tall old clock in the corner. "Good-night, Harry."

MOOREi THE sun arose the next morning with a very smiling face, as if he expected to look upon pleasant scenes ere he went to bed again, and as Amy was to keep him com- pany, he peeped in at her window to call her.  ie found her already dressed, looking as fresh and sweet as a rose, and he stole behind a big tree, a little dashed that she was up before him. As soon as breakfast was over, Gordon's gigwas brought round to the door.  Pauline and Sybil, nothing loth, were to remain with Mrs. Grey, until after the return from the farm. Every object was new and replete with pleasure to the little girl-the pigs, the ducklings, the lit- tle chickens, were all she thought, such very funny little   THE  FORSAKEN DAUGHTER.       407 things, and as she stood under the shade of the old elm, with a bowl of yellow meal, and the feathery brood came fluttering and cackling around at her call, she laughed and danced witlh glee. Amy saw her from the window, and raising her eyes beaming with gratitude to Gorden who stood by her side: "Look-she will get well now, Harry," she said. Sybil too walked about the grounds with grave dignity, to the great scandal of the old turkey gobbler. Consider- ing her red turban as an infringement upon his rights, he lowered his head, spread wide his tail, and made after her. "Hil now you silly ole critterl shoo-o--spose you tink you can scare ole Sybil! shoo-oo--shoo-o-dere- now I 'spect de nex time you know better 1" as 'she met his ruffled greatness with a smart switch. "Now Amy, I am going to take you within sight of the old farm house,"--said Gorden as he placed himself by her side in the gig,-"for the rest you must form your own plans, and I will join you as soon as I think the de- nouement complete. Soh, Beauty-allons l" The spirited young animal pricked up her ears, tossed her head proudly, as she felt the light rein sweep her glossy neck, then at a gallant pace, set forward, the wheels rolling swiftly over the smooth turnpike. Amy could scarcely speak, as every moment brought her nearer and nearer to the home of her childhood-her emotion was too great for words, and her voice died away, in the music oft her soul. How eagerly her eyes wan- dered over the landscape, resting upon green fields, and spreading forests, which she could not in truth remember, yet fancying she knew them all, and the delusion Wad so9 25 26             J ' "    <pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC6462-00000194"/> 68   ii2  FORiKSA K N   DA UGHtR.       !  pleasant, that she did not attempt to reason with herself as to its fallacy. The gig turned at length into a little cross-road, delight- :fully shady, and spun along over the ruts and pebble stones, when suddenly Amy placed her hand upon the arm of her companion. "Stop here one moment will you, Harry?" and Gorden whew up in the shade of a large tree, which swept over the road. ' This is the spot, I know it is!" she exclaimed. '"Yes, dear Harry, there are the old chestnut-woods, as I have often seen them in my dreams-and there, just there in that little lane; see by that broken tree, there is where the carriage stood, when"--    - 'She could not finish the sentence--it was strange to be so joyful and yet weep 1 She was right.

"Shall I alight here, Harry?" she said in a few mo- ments.  "I think you had better, pet," and throwing the reins over Beauty's neck, Gorden sprang from the gig--but be- fore he could assist her, Amy, light as a Sylph, stood upon the green sward by his side: i "Why, how you tremble, you dear little thing! nowdo you think you can find the way without me?" he said, archly. "See if I don't!" she replied laughing, as she ran swift- ly along the road-side path. "'Stop, stop, Amy I I thought you were to personate a dignified young lady!"Gorden called after her. She kissed her hand back for an answer, and waving an adieu, somewhat abated her speed. As every step brought her nearer, so did everything her eye rested upon seem restored to her memory with strange fidelity-her heart throbbed so joyfully, she could Inot gc on, and she paused for a few moments to gain a little self- control, under the screen of the ragged old Butter-nut tree, in whose hollow trunk Bessie and herself had often set up housekeeping with their rag-dolls, and as she now stooped down and peeped within the rifted seam, bits of broken glass and gay crockery attested to the faithfulness of her memory. Thus concealed from observation, Amy looked upon her old home. And it has not much changed dear read- er, since we saw it last: arrived at a good old age, it scorns modern innovations, and has settled quietly down, un- mindful of the winds and the rain, or the touch of time, which can neither make its roof more gray, nor take from I j    ..    <pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC6462-00000195"/> i410  TEE  F ORS A YE N  D A U G  H TE R., it the pleasant associations of. a long life. How . i ahe remembered it: the porch, still enwreathed with tae clus- tering hop-vine, the old barn, the corn-crib, and, those old sheltering trees, with the arms of Briareus enfolding the dwelling, and--could that be Mother? that nice little old lady feeding the fowls by the little back stoop I yes, she knew it was-it must be I and Mrs. Leslie little knew as she stood there, surrounded by her feathery brood, what a sincere prayer fori her that moment ascended up from the depths of e pure and loving heart 1 The door opened-a young woman with a little babe in her arms stepped out upon the porch, and in a pleasant voice, called to some child, whom Amy could not see:            - ' Take care, Amy, you will hurt your little fingers- go see Grand-mna feed the chickens." Then dandling her infant to the measure of a gay song, she went in and re- closed the door: "That was dear Bessie!" said Amy--as now, summon- ing all her calmness, she drew down her vail and ap- pro ached the house. A. pretty little girl of two or three summers, was swinging upon the old gate --'a fat chubby little'thing, whose frock seemed all too small to meet her plump shoul- ders, and so untied hung loose: "What is your name?" she asked, patting the little curly head.  "Amy," answered the child, lifting her large black eyes. There was a happy smile on Amy's countenance, as she walked up the well-worn path. Her step faltered a little as she ascended the piazza, she looked upon the old 'benches, and up at the swallow's nests, and then she gave i l    THE FORSAKEN    DAUGHTER.     4" a gentle rap at the door. She could almost hear the pul- sation of her heart, as the latch turned. It was opened by Bessie: "Is-is Mrs. Leslie at home?" she asked. "She is-- won't you walk in?" And once more, Amy's foot crossed the threshold of the old Farm House I Bessie led the way into the sitti g-room, and then went out to call her mother, wonderirg very much who the stranger could be that wished to see her. When she was left alone, Amy's eyes wandered around the apartment, the scene of so many pleasant memories. A new homespun carpet of bright colors covered the floor, and various other additions had been made to its old worn furniture, but in the same corner stood the little cherry candle stand, and still resting upon it those sacred volumes, the Bible and the Hymn Book, objects-of her childish veneration: "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path." "Thou art my hiding place, and my shield: I hoper in thy word." Said Amy reverently, as she looked upon them, for she felt that through the holy influences which they had ex- erted over-her, even .in her most tender years, by the bles- sing of God, her feet had been saved from error, and her young heart led to trust humbly in his grace. The door re-opened, and Mrs. Leslie herself entered with the same old pleasant smile upon her features-more wrinkles--but they were all lines of goodness. "How do you do, Ma'am? this is quite a warm day- won't you have a fan?" she said, offering-on to her visi- ,          <pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC6462-00000196"/> "2  THE  FORSAKEN   DrUGHTEiR.  tor, then sitting down, she began fanning herself with a newspaper which she took from the table. Amy tried to say something-all the formal speeches she had framed arose to her lips, but refused utterance. It was of no use-she could not assume indifference, when - her joy was so thrilling: with an hysterical sob she start- ed from her chair, threw back her vail: "Mother, mother don't you know me? don't you know i your own little Amy!" she cried, throwing her arms about her neck. , "Amy!" screamed Mrs. Leslie--"Amy I it can't be-it; can't be I let me look at you--yes, it is, I have found my darling child I Oh, Amy, Amy!" she continued to exclaim, pressing her to her bosom, and weeping for joy.

"I declare, it don't seem possible-it can't be, why, Amy I is it really you-where did you come from--how did you get back? why how you have grown--dear me- is it you, Amy?"

With a hearty laugh at her expense, Gorden now in- formed her that he had himself gone after the party, and brought them home. Amy now proposed returning for Pauline, fearing the child might feel lonely among strangers, but this Mrs. Leslie stoutly resisted--she said she could not trust her again from her sight so soon for fear she would never come back. It was finally arranged that Gorden should return alone and chaperone Pauline and old Sybil to the farm, "You may look for us in about two hours-good bye 1" said Harry, mounting his gig, and kissing his hand to Amy, was soon lost in the shadow of the trees. And now light were the footstep and joyous the smile of our happy heroine, as she merrily flew from place to place. Every nook and corner of the old house, the dairy, the kitchen, cup-boards and closets were all peeped into by a pair of bright eyes, and then up the old creak- ing stairs she lightly sprang, and into the long, low garret, with its great, brown beams cob-webbed and dusty with time, and its one small window with the bright sun- shine streaming through, and the large blue-bottle flies and slender wasps knocking their heads harmlessly against the narrow panes, and buzzing louder and louder at every rebound. And then in the corners and- under the low eaves, were thrifty piles of soft, snowy wool 8nd silky flax ready for spinning, and wheels, and looms, and reels, and the old vinegar barrel working away industriously and singing with the heat-but Amy only gave a hasty glance to this well remembered spot, and then was off to the barn with Lucy, smelling the fresh mown hay} and *             I   THE  FORSAKEN    DAUGHTEIR.   417 half-tempted to venture up into the hay-mow as of old-- the next moment standing in the door of the corn-crib she was shelling off the yellow kernels surrounded by the whole family of the old white rooster calling them on to the feast--then she flew through the meadow " over bush, over briar," and down to the little spring where she used to play "Moses in the bulrushes" with little Johnny. "Come, Lu', on to the corn-fieldl l' she cried, and away the happy girls ran laughing over the freshly mown field, scaring up swarms of long-legged, brown grass- hoppers. Farmer Leshe was busily hoeing the fine, thrifty yield, turning up the rich, dark loam in neat hills around each green stalk, while Johnny followed him doing the same service for the broad pumpkin vines which spread around their net-work of leaves and young fruit. "Why, there'come the girls, father, running like all possessed-what's the matter now, I wonder-guess the cattle have got into the wheat!" said Johnny, wiping the perspiration from his brow. The farmer looked up just as Amy gave one light spring from the top of the five rail fence down into the tall grass and nmullen stalks which bordered the field, and then jumping from furrow to furrow, flitting along through the green corn, she was at his side the next instant. "Here I am father-here is Amy i" she cied, as she seized with both her hands- the only one which the farmer had at liberty. "Why, bless my soul, Amy I you don't say go-Amy -why it can't be lP "Oh, but it is, father " said Lucy, half-crying for joy-" it is Amy, and she has come back to live with us tool"     <pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC6462-00000199"/> "8  THp FORSAKEN      DAUG HTER. The farmer dropped his hoe, took Amy's hands and looked into her face. "Ah, I see--I know those big eyes now!" he said, as he folded her in his arms with a ringing kiss. "Well, I declare, I never expected to see you again, Amyl why s'nt your mother half-crazy, ha-ha-ha I colne give me another smack-that's a good girl, you always were a good girll Put away your hoe, Johnny--here, take mine too- there is no more work to-day for Gabriel Leslie-come, I am going home: to have a jollification with the old woman --ha-ha-ha--come Amy, come Lucy!" Johnny, a big, bashful boy of thirteen, looked side- ways at his new-found sister, and shyly held aloof from the kiss which her red lips proffered, hung down his head and gathering up the hoes and the baskets, started off, yet lingering every few steps and looking back, as if loth, after all, to be but of hearing of that joyous laugh.  One would hardly have supposed Amy, to have been a new comer under the farmer's roof. Throwing off her bonnet as soon as she reached the house, she set to work gleefully in assisting Mrs. Leslie to prepare for this un- expected addition to her family--the good woman follow- ing her about with her eyes, and still almost tempted to' believe herself in a dream, it seemed so sudden and so strange. In the midst-of these active labors the sound of wheels was heard, and a little, light wagon seen spinning along the road. "They are coming-yes, there they 'are 1" cried Amy, running out to the gate just as Beauty checked her speed.

"Now may de Lord bless you, child--you look so berry happy!" she said, smiling and placing her hand on the head of Amy. "Yes, Sybil, we shall all be happy now!" was her an- swer. "Come, Pauline," and taking the little girl's hand she led her up to Mrs. Leslie. "This is my little sister, mother--you will love her for my sake now, and very soon I am quite sure that you will love her for her own." "Why, you're a real nice little girl!" said 'Mrs. Leslie, kissing the child--" but she looks dreadful peaked, don't she, Bessie-never mind, mammy Leslie will soon put some color into them little pale cheeksl why she don't look'the least mite like you, Amy, does she Gabriel? kiss me again I ' Pauline, seeing only love and kindness in that pleasant smile, put her arms about her neck and kissed her, and then placed her little white hand confidingly within that of the farmer, which closed over it like an oyster shell upon its pearl.

Come then without delay.    / Your obedient servant, J. WOODVILLE." One more miserable year had been added to other years of misery, since Amy left the roof of her grand-mo- ther, and still Mrs. Lorraine bore about a face of hol- low smiles. From the day when Amy had turned sorrowing away from her presence, with the little orphan, she had forbid- den her name to be spoken in her hearing, she h d care- fully banished from her sight all that should remind her that Amy had once been there, locked the door of her little chamber, and put away theykey. This was all very easy, a mere matter of outward form, yet she could not as easily quiet her accusing conscience, or check the yearnings of her heart for the sweet girl who had ever been so dutiful and affectionate. She could not drive her image from her mind, las she could her name from her lips and hear- ing. How desolate the house seemed without her, how dreary those splendid rooms! no longer her light step trod the chamber floor, her pleasant voice and gentle hand no lon- ger soothed her troubled nerves, or bathed her throbbing templbs, and the bright face of Amy, no more bent down to hers, each morning with a loying kiss. Ah! many unhappy hours did Mrs. Lorraine experience in the solitude of her chamber, as she remembered her patien; gentleness, and felt what a treasure she had cast from I er. i 26      ii-  upr     <pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC6462-00000202"/> 424   TE  FORSAKEN     DAUaG iTBB A lonely wretched woman, she moved through her de. solate rooms as one condemned to the punishment of their own thoughts, and with no one about her, to whom she could turn for consolation, or for sympathy. She dared not look to Heaven I who was there on earth? even the comfort of old Sybil's presence was no longer hers. To her she had often flown in times past, and to her faithful breast confided her sorrows, and we have seen how ten. derly the old woman listened, and alleviated, as far as her humble sympathy could do, the griefs of her Mistress. But Sybil too had fled from her, and what added torment to -this reflection, was, that she had -fled to protect those whom she had discarded-humiliating thought! Jane was a faithful girl-she pitied her mistress--but Mrs. Lorraine only required her services, not her sympa. thy. Jane's vocation became daily more arduous. Skill- ful ascshe was in her art, she could not achieve miracles. Remorse and ill-nature outrivalled her powers-.she could neither "create a soul under the ribs of death," nor I upon the front of age, place youth and beauty I the poor girl did her best, yet the best was bad in the eyes of Mrs. Lorraine, who daily grew more peevish and exacting. Poor Jane certainly deserves to be chronicled for her mar- tyt-like patience. The sudden disappearance of the new star, " the Lor. raine," was a matter of consternation and bewilderment, for twice nine days--a long life, yet as Mrs. Lorraine, was one whose chilling hauteur always forbade inquiry, the wonder lovers were forced to satisfy themselves with their own conjectures. It may rightly be inferred, that she did not go to Sara- toga, for which so many plans had been laid, for well she   THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.    425 knew that if she visited those crowded halls, where youth and beauty ruled the hour, without the prestige of Amy by her side, she would meet only with mortification and neglect-an ordeal from which she shrank now with as much sensitiveness as she would have done twenty years before. i In July she went out to Lorraine Park--how desolate i every summer Amy had been there with her, and every scene reminded her of her presence. She could not stay there. Its quiet awed her, and the whispers of the old trees were like the tongues of accusing angels. She could better endure the heat of the city, even under the burn- ing sun of August, than those peaceful scenes, and Iso she returned to her lonely mansion in St. John's Square, and with closed doors and windows, wore out the tedious days of summer. And where was Amy all this time I she knew not, and she tried to force herself into the belief that she did not care,-buqt, when she reflected upon her youth, her loveli- ness, and her unprotected situation, she was almost mad- dened I One hour's endurance of that bitter remorse which so often stung the heart of Mrs. Lorraine, was punishment almost adequate to her error. One morning Jane with a very mysterious air, placed in her hands a little note, which to use her own words "a woman of humble garb had deposited in the hands of John, and departed toote sweeter. Mrs. Lorraine glanced carelessly over the superscrip- tion; as she did so, an exclamation of surprise escaped her lips, for she recognised the graceful chirography of Amy She twisted it angrily, as if about to tear it in pieces- then she paused, and looked around, for she did not wish even Jane to detect any feeling, other than resentment,    <pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC6462-00000203"/> 426  THE  FORSAKEN   DAUGHTER. that her grand-child should dare address her. But that 'paragon of all waiting-maids ,had prudently retired, for she too recognised the hand, and understood the weakness of her Mistress too well to remain in the room. For a mo- ment the little note was held irresolute--then a gush of feeling she could not master, ended the strife, and the seal was quickly broken. Tears filled her eyes, as she read the few simple lines which Amy penned ere she left the  city. Amy to her Grandmother. "MY DEAR GRANDMOTHER, It is now three months since we parted, and all this time I have not been far from you-thoe' alas-so distant I Close by a crowded wharf in this hot sultry weather, and l inhaling its pernicious odors, my poor little sister is daily pining away-O how I have longed for the cool shadows of Lorraine Park for her sake I But to-morrow we are going away-going to my early home-to Leslie-Farm, for I have fortunately discovered where my foster-parents reside, and Harry Gorden, do you remember him? he is going to take us there-so don't feel uneasy about me, because I shall be in safe hands. You don't know what a comfort Sybil is to mel Dear Grandmother, I love you, although you- have cast me far from you-I have blessed you every day for your ,kindness to me, when I was with you-and I shall ever pray Heaven for your health and happi- ness. I could not leave the city without telling you where to find me, for something whispers me that we shall yet be re-united and happy. God grant that it may be sol I Good-bye, my dear Grandmother, AMY."   THE  FORSAKEN     D:UGG HT ER.  427 As Mrs. Lorraine read these lines, her tears fell fast, and she could have kissed each word, but at the thought of that child-of Staunton's-child -her tears turned to gall, and every warm impulse of her heart was checked. Yet ever after that little message of love, she felt the hap. pier that her deserted grand-children were safe at the old farm house. The winter wore tediously away, Mrs. Lorraine saw but little company, and then spring and summer ad- vanced. It was early in June, that she found upon her table the letter from Dr. Woodville. She took it up carelessly, the writing was unknown to her-yet her countenance grew deathly pale. ".What can this mean? wo10 shouldc write to me from D----l" sho said, all the bitter past coming up before her, as she read the post mark. With a trembling hand she broke the seal--her eye took in the first few lines, and then with a shriek she sank upon the sofa, burying her face in her hands. "Good heavens what is this! am I awake! Hubert Staunton living-a maniac I what can it mean--what horrid mystery is this! who then was the man that sent that child to me if 'not Staunton " she took up the letter again--" dying," "something of impor- tance to communicate,"-" forgiveness for a great wrong," --" can I have been deceived I O my God-I believe I am going mad?"

SWAIN, WE will not trace that terrible journey of Mrs. Lor- raine, the agony that each moment brought with it, the anguish of her soul, as the hours winged their tedious---- and yet too rapid flight-with the curtains of -her berth closely drawn, she wrung her hands, and writhed in the bitterness of self-condemnation. She reached Hartford early the next morning, and with- out stopping, continued her journey, arriving at D--M - late in the afternoon.    I As the carriage drs w up at the principal inn, a man stepped forward fromt the crowd of idlers about the door, and asked theadriver if the lady was Mrs. Lorraine.

The car- riage passed through the heavy gate-way, rolled along under the leafy shade of June, and drew up at the broad flight of steps, where the doctor himself received her. Dr. Woodville had no sentiment but contempt and ab- horrence for the character of hMrs. Lorraine, for a woman who could believe her young daughter, a mere child, guilty of the errors which Stainton alleged, and who could without one shade of pity force that child, young and beautiful as she was, into a marriage so perfect- ly opposed to every sense of justice, and which, had she been guilty, was a punishment too dreadful even for thought. He saw it in its true light-a sacrifice of all maternal love and duty to, most unmotherly selfishness, personal vanity and jealous fears I As he stood upon the steps, therefore, watching the ap proach of the carriage, his fine features expressed all the stern rebuke which he felt--but when his eye rested upon that haggard countenance, and saw thereon the lines of such deep suffering, his good heart melted with pity, and'there was gentleness and kinidness in the tone with which he addressed her as he handed her from the carriage. ' Your friend still lives, madam," he said, as leaning upon his arm, he conducted her into the, house. "Where is he?" she asked, in a voice scarcely audible l from her emotion. "He is here, madam--I have had him removed from the-Asylum.  I rejoice tlhat you have arrived in time, for  :. . . '!y   THE  F RSAKEN   D A U GHTER.   431 he is a dying man, and it is important that you should re- ceive his confessions." H e threw open the parlor door as he spoke, and 'led Mrs. Lorraine to the sofa. Directly opposite hung the full length portraits of Paul and Beatrice, painted by the former in Florence, and as she raised her eyes they rested full upon them. She grasped the doctor's arm convulsively: "My daughter I Beatrice!" she exclaimed. "Yes, madam, your daughter-my child also as I love to call her!" "And who-who is that other-tell me?" "It is her husband--Paul Saville.'i Mrs. Lorraine groaned aloud-her fears were contirmed --she knew now that she had been deceived. The doctor left the room and she was alone. Throwing back her vail, she gazed up into the sweet face of Bea- trice so expressive of all the purity of her soul, and whose mild, gentle eyes now seemed to reproach her for her cruel desertion of her children. She could not-she dared not look upon her, but turning away her head, buried her face in her hands.  In a few moments the doctor returned, introducing Mrs. Woodville. She too had been prepared to receive their guest with coldness, yet it was only with kindness that she now saluted her: "You must be very tired, madam, with your long ride to-day-will you go up to your roomr--your maid is there?" she said.    ;  "I thank you, I wi accept of your offer," said Mrs. Lorraine, rising. "Madam--" interposed Dr. Woodville, solemnly, "I have just returned from the bed-side of Mr. Staunton-he    <pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC6462-00000206"/> 432  T HE  FORSAKEN   DAUG HTER. is sinking fast, I think. I would advise you to lose no time in speaking with him. If you feel able I will now conduct you to his chamber." Irs. Lorraine shuddered and sank back again upQn the sola.  'Oh--how can I survive this dreadful meeting!" she cried. "Be calm-I will not leave you unless you request it!" "Calm Oh, Dr. Woodville; if you knew all!" "I know much, madam-and I know that you have need of calmness for this interview. Lean on me." She took his offered arm and with slow, unsteady steps ascended the stairs. The doctor gently opened the door of a darkened room. Mrs. Lorraine drew back shuddering, and sank upon a chair which stood near the entrance. In a few moments, summoning all her strength and courage, she advanced into the room, and drew near the bed with hesitating steps. Before her lay a wretched old man, whose ashy pale brow seemed already touched by the cold hand of death, . She gazed fearfully upon him. "Dr. Woodville--who, who, is that man! it cannot be Hubert Staunton-there is some mistake t" "Hubert Staunton it is, Anna," said a hollow voice from the bed. "Oh, my God!" shrieked Mrs. Lorraine, and had not i the doctor sustained her with his strong arm, she would have fallen to the floor. "Compose yourself, madam, I beg of you," he said in a low voice--"you have much to learn-do not by your agitation hastec the moment of dissolution, and thereby defeat the object of your visit." !   THE  FORsiAKEN   DAUGHTER.     438 Again Mrs. Lorrainie approached the bed and stood by the side of the dying man. JHe fixed his glassy eyes upon her, and a horrible smile distorted his haggard features. "Time makes great changes--but guilt greater I don't you find it so, Anna?" There was in the words and in the tone a touch of the old cutting sarcasm which even the approach of death could not check. It was, perhaps, fortunate for Mrs. Lor- raine that it was so--for it had the effect to rouse her pride and nerve her to the task. "You sent for me, Mr. Staunton-what have you to say?" she asked in a cold, severe tone and manner. "Enough, Anna, to make you wish that you were in my place, even to meet damnation tin the other world Dr. Woodville, will you leave the room?" "I request you will stay," said Mrs. Lorraine, placing her hand on his arm.  "I beg your pardon, Madam-what Mr. Staunton has to say is for your ear alone., I will retire into the next room." The doctor then withdrew. "Anna, I am a dying man 1" said Staunton. His voice was strong, yet he was forced to pause for breath between every few words. "But near as death is, and has been to me," he continued-"I have wrestled with him night and day that I might once more see you," here he stopped and fastened his eyes upon her face. "'I am here now--if you have aught to say--speak l" "So cold I well it matters not-this is not the tone in which you once spoke to your -' dear Hubert/' your daughter, Anna Lorraine, was as pure and as innocent in heart as her face was lovely.

"The Almighty is just, and can never forgive such sin! woe, woe to your soul, for the woe you have wrought to others-go on--let me hear all your villany!" "While you curse me, remember'that you have a soul too, to be doomed! if I schemed--you lent yourself to my schemes most successfully.

Mrs. Lorraine was borne fainting from the chamber of death to her own apartment. When she recovered, she requested to be left alone with Jane, and for hours her mental sufferings were such as to threaten her reason. Not once during that long night did sleep visit her eye-lids. In the morning, being too unwell to leave her bed, she sent for Dr. Woodville. But no art was called in to conceal the ravages upon that once most suberb face -she lay there a suffering, repentant woman. As the doctor approached the bed-side, and kindly took her hand, she said: "Will you tell me of Beatrice of all you know con. erning her?l I am a miserable woman, Dr. Woodvile   l       w l   THE  FORSAKEN   DA'UGiHATEiR.   487" I have been sinned against, I know, but I am not the less sinning I And I can never, never tell her how much I have wronged her I I can never plead for her forgive- ness, my beautiful,' suffering child my voice cannot penetrate the tomb!" At these words Dr. Woodville exclaimed, much agi- iated : "What am I to understand, madam I you speak as if Beatrice was no more--God grant I may be mistaken " "She is dead, Dr. Woodville, and died with my curse upon her head!" The doctor walked to the window, and when he again stood by the bed-side his countenance betrayed great sor- row-for we know how dear Beatrice was to himl  "When did your daughter die? and where?"

"Where then is Paul?" "If you mean the husband of my daughter-he is no more; and when I heard of his' death--I thought it was : then Staunton died!"

Long and deeply interesting was the conversation then held within that little chamber. Mrs. Lorraine, without disguise or artifice, unbosomed her heavy load of errors to the doctor, who, christian as he was, could with diffi- culty refrain from reproaching the wretched woman as she proceeded. After giving a full history of the early wrongs of Bea- trice, of her forced and dreadful marriage, of the birth and abduction of her child, she proceeded to speak of Amy, and the tears rolled down her cheeks as she dwelt upon her patience, her loveliness, of her n ble sacrifice for her sister, and her gentle pleadings and stern rebukes for that little sister's sake and then as she bowed her head with shame, she told him how she had cast both those unoffending orphans upon the cold charity of the world l "But thank God!" she exclaimed, as she concluded her painful narrative-" thank God it is not too late to repair in some measure the wrong I have done them I so long as He spares my life, it shall be devoted to their happiness!" The recital of Dr. Woodville was brief, for he wished to spare the feelings of the unhappy -woman as much as possible. When he had ended, he placed in her hands the manuscript which he received from Beatrice relating her early sorrows. "There, madam," he said; " read that-read that artless narrative penned in this very chamber by your daughter's hand-God knows I pity you I now tell me where those children are to be found, for, God willing, not another day shall pass over my head ere I seek them out and bring them home."            'l Mrs. Lorraine directed him to Leslie Farm, blessing the affection of Amy which had led her to communicate the place of her retreat.   THE  FO RSAKEN   DAUGHTER.     439  Their arrangements were soon made, for love lent them speed-altho' tot without some dispute, for Dr. Wood- ville insisted upon bringingothe children to his house and home, while Mrs. Lorraine, on the other hand, claimed her right of affinity to have them with her-a claim to which he was finally obliged to yield. Mrs. Lorraine, therefore, accompanied by Mrs. Wood. ville, who, dear old lady, insisted with tears upon her right to the children of Beatrice, was to leave in the morning for Lorraine Park, and in as short a time as was possible to accomplish the journey, Dr. Woodville was to join them with the objects of so much Ibve and solicitude. 27  ,         4    <pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC6462-00000210"/> "O   THE  FORSAKEN     DAU1GHTR R CHAPTER LII It often falls, in course of common life, That right long time is overborne of wrong, 1 Through avarice or power, or guile, or strife, That weakens her, and makes her party strong, But justice, though her dome she doe prolong Yet at the last, she will her own cause right."

And Amy, dear Amy, her cup is full and overflowing with happiness--the thoughts of her Grand-mother alone disturb her peace, of her she often thinks with sadness, and in her prayers remembers. She did not come back to the "Hive," as farmer Leslie- used to style the old house, to be a drone-not she--her hands were never idle, and Mrs. Leslie often said, that if they were so very small, they were worth half a dozen others. and always were. And now that she could leave Pauline, she went daily to Auburn, where she had ob- tained a few scholars in music and drawing--for these ac. complishments were fast creeping in with the more hum- ble acquirements of western life, giving both pleasure and refinement wherever they were indulged. Every morning, rain or shine, saw Harry Gorden's gig at the gate of the old farm house, and his handsome bright face looking out from its dark covering, like the sun fromg a cloud, as with a tap of his whip upon the silver mount ing, he would sing out: "Come pet, are you ready?" And then Amy would spring laughing down the steps with her little roll of music in her hand, and! take her place by his side--at the word, Beauty would prick up her ears, give her head a toss, and take her graceful speed, her hoofs seeming scarce to touch the ground, while Amy, looking back would kiss her hand gayly to Lucy and Pauline, who always stood watching her fom the gate. 1,            1        *    <pb n="442-443" xml:id="VAC6462-00000211"/> "2   T H  FORSA KEN    DA UGHTER.  Sybil soon became a general favorite, and under the ge. nial influences around her, and the pleasure side felt at seeing her young mistress so happy, she seemed to re- new both her strength and her youth. It was a pleasant sight to see the good old soul moving about the house to the music of her song, or out in the barn-yard jealously counting every addition to the feathery brood, or seated upon the milking stool, coaxing the "'cushee-cow-bonnie," to " let down her milk "-but no matter where the good old creature was, she was ever assisting in the labors of the farm with a light and cheerful heart, and willing hand. Sometimes, and this was an event of great importance, when her gayest turban was wound about her dusky brows, and her whitest apron put in requisition, Gordeon would himself take her to spend the day at his house- poor Sybil--her old back always ached a day or two after these "glorifications," from the strain put upon it in the multiplicity and humbleness of her courtesysl A lovely day was drawing to its close, so too the labors which it had brought with its dawning, and in the little porch sat Mrs. Cesle in her comfortable rocking chair, with little Harry Lee on her lap, for Bessie had come over from her new home to spend the day, and now, with all the pride of a young house-keeper, was relating to her no less- proud mother, her wonderful success in, her new vocation.

He has come over to help the farmer with his haying, and now with his hat off, and his broad bold forehead bared to the soft evening wind, he stands upon the summit of the highest load, and with skill- ful aim pitches the fragrant new-mown hay, upon the hay- mow while the farmer boasts of his success in draining the old swampy meadow, which never before had yielded such a crop. Poised upon the hub of the old cart-wheel, is Pauline, merry little Pauline, her sweet face turned upward, her curls sweeping behind her like a golden vail thrown back, and between laugh and song, pours forth a little vintage hymn which she learned in her own bright Italy--but the measure changes to one long bird-liLe laugh, as Gorden sends down upon her little head a tingling shower from the tines of the fork, which he wields so dexterously. "De lands sake,i hear to dat child's blessed little voice!" said Sybil, as the merry sound reached the kitchen,- "'clare 'pears as if I nebber did hear noting half so sweet, 'cept mebbe Missy Amy-hark I now dat be her voice for $ure, 'pears as if dey wer all gwine off de handle, Massa Harry and all!"

Tossing back her disordered curls, Amy ran after her, and soon caught thee merry laughing little thing-swinging her around gayly, she softly placed her in a little bed of clover, and setting down by her side, began kissing and tickling her fat little shoulders. "Look--see aunt' Amyl" said the child, pointing Iwith i her little finger.                    0 Amy raised her eyes--blushing deeply, as they met those of a stranger, who stood leaning over the fence, in- tently regarding her.  Opening the gate, the stranger advanced: "This is Leslie Farm, I believe?" Amy bowed-he held'out his hand with a kind smile: - "Dr. Woodville. And you are Amy--I know I am  not mistaken--Amy the child of my dear Beatrice-the     child whom she so deeply mourned as dead, and let me add,'" as he carried her hand to his lips--" the noble self- p i sacrificing girl, who rejected all the allurements of wealth, to endure hardships and poverty, because she would not see her little sister wronged!" II "Don't say that, my dear sil," said Amy, blushing, 1 I have endured no hardships--no sorrow, except the thought  of my grand-mother's anger and injustice."  "That is all past now, dear girl-I have a message to you from her."  Amy started with surprise and pleasure, at these words:  her face beamed with joy:    I . "fIave you-have you I and will she receive my dear little sister homei?" "She will, Amy.

Leaving him Aeated in the porch, Amy now flew to her room to repr the work of those mischievous little fngers. Pauline in the mean time came dancing 'round the cor- ner of the house, with a garland of hay twisted amid her golden curls.

The doctor was unable to speak, but folded the child to his bosom, and large tears, which he could not re. strain, fell upon her sunny brow like a blessing. Amy soon returned, and with an apology to Mrs. Les-  lie, she conducted Dr. Woodville into the little sitting room. ' "I cannot express to-you, Amy, my feelings at seeing you, for my first acquaintance with your dear mother is painfully connected with you--the first words I heard pass her lips were for her babe! O, my child, how often did my heart ache to hear her piteous lamentations--still  persisting with irresistible pathos that her babe was not dead! indeed, Amy, I do not think she was ever fully convinced. Poor-poor Beatrice-how   she would have * loved you, Army! how proud she would have been to have clasped you to her heart!"  "And tell me, tell me, Dr. Woodville--was she so un- dutiful to my  grandmother?" asked Amy, fixing her earnest eyes upon his.:  "No, my child. Your mother was as pure a creature, as free from sin, as it is possible for human nature to be!"  "Thank God, my   dear sir, for those words, for you know not what a  load you have lifted from my heart! f6r years there dwelt an image in my heart which I wor- shipped as my mother-I thought of her with so much love, and prayed God that I might be like her!"

Compassion for her grand- mother's mental sufferings and self-reproaches-pleasure that she was once more to meet her and dwell with her in love, and deep thankfulness that her little sister was to share in that love.

"So soon!" and the tears, which she had been trying so  long to suppress, now gushed forth.          X The doctor left her and joined the family. i They were all seated around the hospitable board, test- ing the flavor of Sybil's fine biscuits and-broiled chicken, when Amy came in perfectly calm and apparently cheer- ful and took her place by the side of her old friend, Harry Gorden, but the jealous eyes of those who loved her soon  detected the shadow upon her fair face. After tea, Gorden invited Dr. Woodville to return home with him, as the accommodations of Mrs. Leslie were rather limited. As Amy shook hands with the doctor when parting, she whispered that she would be ready at an early hour in the morning to accompany him. "Dear Harry, I am going away from here " she said, in a low voice, as she bade Gorden good night-" don't ask any more-Dr. Woodville will tell you all."

"Whew-wl what that old-hiem--hem-good night, petl" Soon after Dr. Woodville and Gorden left, Amy broke the sad intelligence to the circle of loving hearts around her.

The farmer made two or three strides across the room; and then coming up to Amy he took her hands. "Now, Amy, you know best-but I don't want you to leave us! n nono, stay with us-and so long as we have a roof to shelter us, it shall shelter you and little Pauline, if you will only say so." Bessie, and Lucy could not speak, but they hung around Atmy, and looked entreatingly into her eyes, and Pauline sobbed and begged sister Amy not to take her away from the farm-she did not want to go to grand- mother, she said. Old Sybil looked from one to the other sorrowfully and shook her head.

How peaceful and serene the face of Nature! no sound but the sweet music of the birds broke that calm, summer dawning-they chirped and twittered through the glossy leaves, shaking down with their bright wings showers of pearly' drops upon the sweet clover blossoms, already damp and fragrant with the night dew. From the little farm houses which were scattered through the- valley no smoke as yet ascended, and in the distance her eyes caught the spires of Auburn penciled against the eastern sky, which was every moment growing more bright, more roseate and golden at the approach of the day-god. Amy's heart was full of sorrow as she gazed. There was One only who could comfort her-and to Him sloe- now turned; and in that Ialm and holy hour of the summer morning, "She knelt for Heaven's grace and boon." !

Dwarf shrubberies hid the trunks of these tall trees- the swamp apple, the glossy laurel with its superb clusters of pink, the ha -thorn, and the flowering almond, these formed sweet hiding places for the birds, until the winds of autumn, sent them "their feathers all-a-cold," to the sunny south. Sweet music was ever heard in those shady avenues.

If she had been the cause of sor- row to the mother-the lives of her dear children should,   THE, FORSAKEN'     DAUGHT'E R.    457 be one long day of happiness I All that wealth could pur- chase for their pleasure or for their comfort should be theirs, as free" as were the winds of Heaven-their wishes should find answers before they were expressed. Travel should wing the hours with varied scenes-books, no matter how costly, should be cast upon their tables-music and paint- ing, with all the fascinations of the drama, were to be theirs at their will-their rooms should be perfumed with the sweetest and rarest flowers, and birds of the most beautie ful plumage should warble for their delightl I Mrs. Lorraine was about to commit another great er- ror, yet it sprang from a motive so pure, that we must not blame her. She mistook the happiness of our Amy -one look of love--one word of true sympathy, was dearer to her heart than all the luxuries which her grand- mother would have heaped upon her. With such feelings then did the Mistress of Lorraine Park, enter those massive gates, which swung wide to re! ceive her the second day after leaving D---- . How d- ferent her feelings now, from those which rankled in her breast when she fled thence, as the carriage rolled on be. neath the shade of those noble old trees, up to the broad terrace! Sustained by her new resolves to make others happy, Mrs. Lorraine cast from her all her bitter reflec- tions for private hours, and now bent her efforts for the entertainment of her guest, Mrs. Woodville, and to pre-  pare for the reception of her grand-children, who might be expected aimost any day. It is impossible to give a just conception of the change of character, and person, between the Mrs. Lorraine whom we have met in St. John' square, Under such varied scenes, and her who now moved through the chambers of the old mansion, designing and officiating in the a'angements for    <pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC6462-00000219"/> "8   THE  FORSAKE3N   DAU GHTE R.  the expected travellers. Before, she was a made-up form, whereon fashions were displayed, and jewels and cosme- tics ticketed--now, she dressed richly but appropriately- X her rouge blushed in her dressing case, to find itself neg. lected, and the bandeau of glossy black, gave place to her own silver tresses. Jane felt "her occupation gone," with all its "pride, pomp, and circumstance.' She walked around bewil- dered-either her Mistress or herself were certainly be- side themselves-she was Ireaming-or her Mistress crazed I                         X Preparations were in active progress. Every pleasure  X in which Amy took delight on former visits to the Park were now all jealously remembered and provided for, no matter how difficult of attainment. Tho gardener received orders to trim the shrubberies, and arrange the conserva- tory as "Miss Amy " had once planned-all her feathery pets or their descendants were called out and pronmoted from the large family of chanticleer-the rabbits and the guina-pigs were washed and rubbed until their sleek skins shone again, and poor Jane was forced to mount the pony and amble round X the grounds, that he might not prove fractious to his young Mistress, after so long freedom from bit and rein; a little Shetland was purchased for Pauline,  and duly caparisoned, while with her own hands, Mrs. Lor- raine arranged the suite of rooms which she gave up to her grand-children. Mrs. Woodville, excellent old lady, walked around serene and smiling, yet wishing for the arrival of her husband, from whom, for forty years, she had not been so long separated.

THE  FORSAKEN     DAUGHTER.    459 news spread through the house with gladness, for every soul loved the gentle; girl. Mrs. Lorraine was up with the sun from a sleepless couch. Longing, as she was, to fold Amy once more to her bosom, she almost shrank from the meeting-she felt herself condemned and humbled in the sight of her grand- child Amy now had been informed of all--she knew of her folly-her madness-how could she then meet the rebuke of those gentle eyesl But the remembrance of her kind heart and gentle disposition subdued these fears. She knew that Amy could speak, and speak home to the heart and the conscience, for her mild rebukrigs had often shamed her, but now she felt that she had nothing to fear, and if earthly lips could whisper comfort to her troubled mind, it rested, she knew, with that patient loving girl. "Away then with a sad and sorrowful face l" thought Mrs. Lorraine--"I must be all smiles and gladness to, welcome her." Nature too seemed to have taken pleasure in decorating herself for the approach of her child. During the night she had sprinkled the dusty walks and washed each tree and way-side shrub until their thick foliage sparkled in the sun light, and then she had thrown a richer mantle of green over the broad lawn. So balmy and redolent was the air with fresh blown roses and new-mown hay, that one would almost think Nature had trafficked with art, and showered her domains with the choicest of per- fumes. The birds too wre in fall feather, and were tuning their pipes for the concert which they intended to give, gratis to the fair gil who had protected their nests, and so often sprinkled crumbs for their lunch.

The Oriole flashed out in his most brilliant suits and took the most conspicu- ous stand upon t e tip end of the elm's highest branch, and there carelessly swung himself to' and fro, for the ad- miration of his cousin, the little brown thrush, who sang away very sweetly, nor envied his gaudy plumage. The  littlewrenl and the chipping-bird held a confab under the  hawthornf as they scratched up a worm for their brood--  they agreed they could not do much, but the wren sug. gesting that "every little helps," they chipped and chir- ruped to their nests quite contented. The yellow-bird  flew about uneasy, calling "Pheobe!" "Pheobe!" as if some one of her little family was missing, which the cat- bird hearing, he brushed his wing almost in her face, and  maliciolsly mocked her cries. The bob-o-link flew up  from his bath of sweet clover dew, and pluming himself very greatly upon his powers, he threw back his head  and, after a low, sweet trill, burst forth into a brilliant roulade, at- which he was unanimously chosen by the feathered choir to open the concert, while the wood-pecker, fat and plump, in his snowy vest like a Jullien of the woods, agreed to: sound the signal by three taps of his baton. The day wore on, and anticipation grew painful from its eagerness. ,-  Mrs. Lorraine and Mrs. Woodville, in the large, oaken drawing-room, awaited the arrival of those so dear to them, and in the hall the servants were all gathered to welcome "Miss Amy;"Jane standing preeminent in height and redundant in "wreathed smiles," for no fea- " .'

Hark  every ear is strained to catch the sound-not a word is spoken-Mrs. Lorraine can even hear the beating of her heart in the silence-again-hark I yes-they are coming! wheels are heard rolling swiftly along under that glorious arch of green, and the birds begin their song. It comes nearer-nearer-a well known voice is wafted through the open window, and a child's lau'gh joins with it-nearer-nearer- -now the carriage stops- hark-a moment more--light footsteps cross the broad terrace-their music is in the hall-Mrs. Lorraine with open arms advances.
