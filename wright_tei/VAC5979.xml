            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>FAR away from the scenes of those fierce conflicts between passion and principle—stranded on the leeshore of life, with calmer pulses and a steadier heart, and above all, with the consciousness that I am fast nearing that dim shadow-land at whose misty boundaries life's wildest sorrows lose their sting, and seem no longer what they were when we stood to face them in the full flush of youth and strength—I propose to write out for you, oh, ever true and tender! the history of my life, and by this mark of unsought confidence, vindicate my worthiness of the trust you have so generously reposed in me, since the hour in which you took me, in such brave unquestioning silence, to your heart and home.</p>
            <p>Even then I realized all of your noble-heartedness, and felt far more gratitude than words can express,<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC5979-00000004"/> for the delicate generosity which forbore to question, by word or sign, a sorrow mysterious and unflattering to you, whose wedded wife I was. For a long time the wound, though healed, was too tender to be touched; but now, with a heart honestly your own—although, alas! its freshness has all departed—I can bear that you should know all, since the knowledge will prove to you how completely the past has been blotted from my heart and life.</p>
            <p>Much of this record was written years ago, when the events and the emotions excited by them were vivid realities, and page after page will wound you deeply. But comfort yourself, as you read, with the thought that the love and agony so sharply outlined in them are all dead, believe me, beyond the power of recall. What is left of affection is wholly yours. And oh, that I had more to give, so that I might in some measure repay the generous devotion lavished so freely upon me.</p>
            <p>I have long wished to show you these sealed pages of my life, but I lacked the courage requisite to inflict the pain that would needs ensue from such a disclosure, and, like a coward, deferred it from day to day. But now the ebbing of life's tide warns me that ere long I will be stranded upon the shores of the great Hereafter, and so I gather up the fragments of a life all marred and blighted, and lay them at your feet.</p>
            <p>I do not say forgive me, when you see me stripped of all concealments, an erring, suffering woman. I know I have no need to ask it of you, for where there is so much love, there will also be much forgiveness. I only say, believe that at the last—poor and insufficient as the acknowledgment is—I was as faithfully and devotedly in heart as in name,</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>THE Tressylians, a Norman-French family, came in with the Conqueror, and had ever borne an honorable part in the history of their times. They suffered the usual vicissitudes entailed by the great civil wars, which from time to time convulsed the kingdom. Spending life and treasure lavishly for the royal cause during the Cromwellian usurpation, and finally being engulfed in the downfall of the Stuarts—for they were a loyal race and spared neither blood nor substance to support the measures they espoused—with the failure of their royal master's hopes, the "Trusty Tressylians" forsook public life, and never again took an active part in the scenes where they were wont to be well represented, but buried themselves in their ancestral halls, clinging fondly to the memory of the sovereigns for whom they had done and suffered so much. With the proud fidelity which<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5979-00000006"/> characterizes some races, they never, even by accidental forgetfulness, acknowledged any sovereignty but that of the hapless Stuarts; always scornfully designating the ruling faction as the "Hanoverian usurpers."</p>
               <p>Of course this stanch loyalty cost them dear, for friends and neighbors who had yielded to the pressure of circumstances, and bowed the knee to Baal, fell away from those whose faithfulness, through good report and evil report, was a reproach to their own weakness and defection. And thus, too haughty to adapt themselves, for expediency, to the tone and temper of their times, they withdrew still more from intercourse with the outside world, and found their associates and interests only amid the limits of the few Jacobite families, who, like themselves, had refused to forsake Right for Might. Living for years in luxurious indolence, and cultivating assiduously their exclusiveness, the family at length, as such families will who count no <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mésalliances</foreign> in their line, began to diminish perceptibly in numbers and vitality. Fewer children were born to them, and of those few the larger proportion failed to reach maturity. And although, as a haughty ancestress of the house once loftily said, "What were born were still Tressylians," the family was rapidly dying out. Even Tressylian blood could not maintain its vitality unimpaired when there was never a fresh healthy current infused into it, and at the period from whence my history dates, my father was the sole lineal representative of his race.</p>
               <p>Reared in the strictest conformity to the hereditary traditions, he married early in life the only daughter of his father's younger brother. I was the third and last child of this union. My two brothers died in their infancy, and their loss was a sorrow from which my mother never recovered. Inheriting, as she did, a peculiarly intense nature, coupled with a frail physical organization, such as too often marks the less of an old family, she could offer no resistance to mental trouble, but drifted into a state of nervous depression which completely unfitted her for the cares and duties of social life. And thus it happened that I attained the age of seventeen, with no companionship except that of my parents. In them centred all my happiness, and upon them I lavished the utmost devotion, receiving from them the tenderest care and most indulgent fondness. My life glided away like a holiday-dream, from which, alas! my waking was to be rude and terrible.</p>
               <p>A shock so sudden and dreadful, and entailing hardships which had been unknown for generations to my<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5979-00000007"/> Sybarite race, it touched directly at the fountain of life. And although the wound remained concealed by the splendid but short-lived vigor of my <foreign xml:lang="FRA">physique,</foreign> it had undermined not the less surely because so silently; and when sorrow laid steady siege, the foundation suddenly gave way, and lapsed into irremediable ruin.</p>
               <p>The democracy have but little after all to envy in their bluer-blooded brethren, did they but realize the supreme balance of the universal system, which takes away in proportion as it gives, and thus preserves the equipoise intact. They envy the porcelain its fineness without considering that in the nature of things it is exposed to dangers, such as its hardier wedgewood and ironstone neighbors never know.</p>
               <p>The long flight of years which has filled the halls of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">noblesse</foreign> with honors and riches, and written their names broadly on the history of their times, has just as surely sapped their vitality and diminished their numbers, and left them with trains of diseases as well as honors, channels of suffering as well as wealth, and if they have written their name upon many a roll of fame, it has been as often inscribed for them on the sexton's register and the mad-house lists.</p>
               <p>And yet it is much, very much, to come of a race whose mere name stirs the blood to deeds of honor and chivalric emprize; to point down the vista of vanished years and claim, in the shapes that stand forth most bright and distinct, the shade of a grandsire, and a grandsire's sire; and to know that, although their dust has mingled with Mother Earth for centuries perhaps, still the world is the better for their lives.</p>
               <p>The American Jefferson's declaration that all men are born equal (if he spoke it in the spirit which demagogue orators declare, but which I do not insult the memory of so profound a thinker by believing), is easier of refutation than the fundamental principle of a great state-paper should be.</p>
               <p>Equal, in the sight of God, beyond a doubt they are; but in the eyes of their fellow-men, in the work they do in the world, in the footprints they leave in life's pathway, equal they are not. Blood makes a difference, and blood will tell. A man who is born a gentleman, and realizes it, will fill every station in life, from the highest to the lowest, better than if he had been born a hind. 'Tis the blooded horse who dies upon the race-path or under the saddle ere he will flinch from what is expected of him, while neither spur nor lash can urge the roadster from his usual pace.</p>
               <p>In these principles I was reared, until they penetrated every fibre of my being. I was an aristocrat by<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5979-00000008"/> birth, theory, and principle, and I could have easier parted with my life than stain it with one action unworthy of the race from which I sprang. And yet it was from none of the self-sufficient arrogance of the Spanish hidalgo; I did not think that I was in anywise better than my fellow-men, I only felt that because I was a Tressylian everything high-toned and honorable was expected of me. This have I written in no spirit of proud boasting, for ere many moons wax and wane the last of the Tressylians—the sole scion of that knightly house—will be lying as low as the most unlettered knave who ever wrote his name with a × mark; but because this slight <foreign xml:lang="FRA">résumé</foreign> of family history will explain some portions of my narrative which might otherwise appear overstrained or obscure.</p>
               <p>This unlocking of prison-doors, and setting free the ghosts who were chained therein, has unnerved me more than I dreamed it would. There were so many skeletons of the past lying in the way, which stirred my soul to its utmost depths, that I can but outline them; I dare not trust myself to reclothe them in all the freshness and beauty that erstwhile they wore. And this is from no latent infidelity to present ties; only from that instinctive shrinking from flames in which we once were scorched.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>THE end came at length, after three days of agonizing suspense; and although it was what I had dreaded from the first, when the blow actually fell it seemed to have all the awful suddenness of an unthought-of calamity.</p>
               <p>My dear father—how hard it was to give him up! to see the clear blue eyes closed, and the firm lips so rigidly set, and know that they would never smile upon me again; that henceforth I must learn to live without his love—we who had been such companions, so very, very intimate. Ah, me! the agony of that parting will never be overpast. But three days before I had parted so gaily from him, as he rode off in all the pride and vigor of full manhood, and in less than an hour he was brought home, crushed, bleeding, and speechless. His horse, in attempting to leap a fence, had fallen upon him, and some internal injury was inflicted which baffled human skill.<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5979-00000009"/> He never spoke or evinced the least consciousness, and, after three days of agonized watching and waiting, and passionate hoping against hope, we stood beside him in the gray hush of dawn, as he lay so rigid and motionless, and knew, with that strange, dumb agony of a realized dread, that what we greatly feared had come upon us.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Mamma, always feeble, completely broke down; and I had all the care and responsibility to assume, at a time when my sole wish was to be at his side all the while he was left to us, and afterwards to be let alone. I was compelled, however, to rouse myself; and, trying as it then was, doubtless in the end it was better that it had been so.</p>
               <p>When the affairs of the estate came to be investigated, it was evident that the death of my beloved father was not the only loss which we were called upon to sustain. The whole property was hopelessly involved; and when the debts were all liquidated, as mamma and I instantly decided they should be, there would be nothing left for our support. There had been woful carelessness of all business affairs on my dear father's part, and gross fraud and mismanagement on the part of his agents; and everything was wrecked. It matters but little how it was all brought about—ruin to us was the irremediable result, and at seventeen I found myself the sole dependence of a widowed and invalid mother. Completely ignorant of the ways of the world,—proud, sensitive, and impulsive,—the position was one whose duties I was ill fitted to fulfill; but I assumed them with a brave heart and steadfast will. To my inexperienced mind the future did not look more overcast because I would have to earn all that we spent. Reared in the lap of luxury, how could I dream what woful significance lies in the words poverty and want? Warm friends came to us with words of sympathy and love, and the hearty kindness shown to us in those dark days did much to neutralize their pain.</p>
               <p>'Twas many weeks before our pecuniary affairs were finally adjusted. The property had passed by private sale into other hands, and at the expiration of the month we were to give possession. The purchaser took the Hall as it stood; furniture, paintings, china, and plate were all included in the bill of sale; and a retired ship-chandler was owner of the halls where a Stuart had slept, and heroes had been born and died. Despite his kindness and liberality, for he showed us much of both, it galled me sorely that such a man should rule as master in my father's home. And I thought if our successor had<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5979-00000010"/> only been a gentleman I could have given up my beautiful home with less reluctance.</p>
               <p>The establishment had been reduced to the smallest possible scale; and of our late magnificence nothing remained to us but such articles of furniture as were indispensable to the plainest housekeeping. Our plans for the future were very simple. We were to remove to Exham, a beautiful and retired village on the coast, and I would take pupils in music and the languages, which, in addition to the few hundreds that might be left us, would furnish us a moderate support.</p>
               <p>Mr. Percival, the rector of our parish, and our best friend, had taken the management of our business into his own hands, and we were indebted to him for much active kindness. He went in person to Exham, secured the promise of a number of pupils for me, and obtained for us the use of a beautiful cottage belonging to the De Vere estate, at an almost nominal rent. Indeed, had it not been for him we would have fared badly. Mamma had neither the ability nor will to transact any business, and I, though willing enough, was hopelessly ignorant on all points. And, involved as our affairs had become, it took both skill and courage to unravel the tangles.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>AT length the dreaded close of our residence at Tressylian Hall arrived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Percival was to accompany us to our new home, and Nurse Becky—dear, faithful soul—had folded her sturdy arms across her broad breast and avowed her unalterable determination to follow us to the Land's End, if need be. No representations of our poverty, or remonstrances against her sacrificing herself for us, would avail to turn her from her purpose. She had but one reply to make to all my expostulations: "It's no use, Miss Helen," she would say, "telling me such things; my mind is made up, and the Lord Mayor of London could not change it. If you have lost all your fortune through the wickedness of other people, you are no more able to wait on yourselves now than you were when you had a servant for each hour in the day. And it stands to reason that I, who have served your family all the<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5979-00000011"/> days of my life, as my people all did before me, will do more and better for you than some new-fangled girl, who might know naught of gentlefolks' ways, or how to make up a bed fit for my honored mistress to lay her blessed head upon, to say nothing of a decent slice of toast, and clear-starching." And to this unassailable position she betook herself, and no argument was strong enough to dislodge her.</p>
               <p>Dear nurse! faithful and true! I raise my eyes as I write these words, and they rest upon your kindly, furrowed face, smiling fondly upon me as in the days of my happy childhood; and I cling to you with such infinite tender yearning, as the last living link which binds me to the memories of the past. And I pity you so deeply, because, much as you have borne with me, there looms up in the horizon a sorrow that I must cause your faithful heart to bear, when I shall be able to soften its sharpness by neither word nor sign.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The last day at home! how can I paint its wretchedness? Mamma lay all day in her darkened chamber, while I wandered from room to room and kissed each dear dumb thing from which it was so hard to part. I walked all over the grounds and gazed through blinding tears at the familiar haunts of my childhood, turning from each with the bitter thought that I would never gaze upon it more. If the house had only been dismantled it would not have been so hard; but to see everything in its accustomed place, the books and albums lying on the tables, the pictures hanging on the walls, the rich vases filled with flowers, all so natural and home-like, and yet all so changed to us who were doomed to go forth in hopeless exile from it, our ancient home. It seemed to me as if I could not bear it. I clenched my hands and grew rigid in the intensity of my pain, until the musical chiming of the hall clock seemed to break the tension binding heart and brain, and I sank upon the floor in a passion of tears and wept until the tears refused to flow. We Tressylians had become lichens from long growing in one place, and when we were wrenched apart many a fibre broke and bled.</p>
               <p>Early the next morning, in a chill, gray fog, the carriage drew up before the door, and we rose from our untasted breakfast to depart. The servants were standing weeping in the hall, and as we passed out, they bade us good-bye with mingled tears and blessings. I drew my heavy veil close over my face, to hide the beloved scenes through which we were passing, and pressed my fingers desperately in my ears, to shut out the sound of the lodge gate as it closed forever upon<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5979-00000012"/> us. Mamma sat calm and motionless, a slight rigidity in her face and attitude the only sign of the pang it cost her to leave the home of her happy wedded life.</p>
               <p>I breathed more freely when we were out of the demesne; and when we at last reached the station, and were locked into the coach that was to convey us to our new home, I felt, with a sense of positive relief, that the worst was over. Mr. Percival intrenched himself behind the ample folds of the morning <title>Times,</title> and read unremittingly for several hours, long, I was sure, after he had exhausted all articles of interest. At last, seeing him glance wearily down an already well-read column, I said, "Suppose you lay it aside, and tell me something of our new home." He laid the paper away with evident relief, but refused to tell me aught of Exham. "No, my dear, you will soon be there, and, expecting nothing definite, there will be less risk of disappointment." And to such sound reasoning I opposed no farther request.</p>
               <p>A carriage was waiting for us at Exham station, and just as the sun was dipping his golden disc into the glowing sea of rosy western clouds, we drove through the pretty, picturesque village to Rose Cottage. Everything in the village looked so trim and thrifty, that my spirits began to rise above a dead level, and when we stopped before the small but very pretty cottage, which was to be our future home, I looked about me with positive interest. A neat, gravelled, box-edged walk, led through a small yard beautifully set with turf, and glowing with plots and borders of bright-colored flowers, to a low-eaved porch, over which a wilderness of vines and creeping roses grew in tangled luxuriance. Nurse Becky, who had gone down the day before with the boxes, opened the door for us, and the tears sprang into my eyes at the sight of her kind familiar face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Percival, entering first, turned as we crossed the threshold, and said heartily,</p>
               <p>"Welcome to your new home, my dear friends, and may the blessing of the widow's and the orphan's God rest upon it for your sakes."</p>
               <p>A prettily-sized hall opened upon a wide passage which traversed the house, with two rooms on either side. The first one we entered was to be our sitting-room, and, as I raised my eyes, the first object upon which they rested was my dear father's portrait; and a farther survey revealed all the furniture of what had been our favorite morning-room at Tressylian Hall.</p>
               <p>"How can I thank you, sir?" I said, turning to Mr. Percival with brimming eyes.</p>
               <p>"Why, my dear, by saying no more about it, I believe," was his smiling response.</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5979-00000013"/>
               <p>He showed us through the house, which everywhere bore the same touching evidences of his thoughtfulness, and when our tour of inspection was ended, nurse brought in the tray of tea. Despite mamma's and Mr. Percival's efforts, the meal was a sad one. To see the familiar service in such a strange, new place, was a trial that I could bear only by keeping silent. To speak would have been likewise to weep, and, shamed by mamma's brave composure, I did not wish to christen our coming home with tears. I was not to occupy mamma's chamber, so when I retired I had full license to cry at will, and like a child, as in truth I was, I wept myself to sleep.</p>
               <p>The next morning, after an early breakfast, Mr. Percival left us. I restrained my grief until I saw him turn from the door, and then I felt that we were parting with our only friend, and I fell upon his neck weeping and heart-broken. He gently hushed and comforted me, and when my clinging fingers relaxed their hold, and my passionate sobs sank into quivering sighs, he softly unclasped my hands, and kissing me on either cheek, strode rapidly away, turning ever and anon, as long as the cottage was in sight, to wave me a cheery good-bye.</p>
               <p>True servant of the most high God! were all the dressers of thy Master's vineyard more like thee, there would be fewer vines barren, fewer that bring forth wild grapes. Faithful shepherd that thou wert, going forth to seek that which was astray or lost, binding up the broken, and gently, aye, <emph>gently,</emph> leading thy flock towards the heights of Heaven. Humbly didst thou labor, bearing alone the burden and heat of the day, and now thou restest in the shadow of thine appointed place, far from the white cliffs of Albion, beside the dreaming waters of the Mediterranean, beneath the sunny blue of Italy's bright skies. Stranger hands laid thee to thy dreamless rest, strange skies arch over thee, but He who giveth His beloved sleep knows where He lays them down, and in the fullness of the appointed time the Master's voice will rouse thee from thy slumbers, and bid thee, oh, faithful servant, to "enter into the jov of thy Lord."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>THE village of Exham was small and sparsely settled, for though its nearness to the sea made it a popular summer resort, the same proximity rendered it bleak and unpleasant during the rest of the year. Our reasons for selecting it as a residence were manifold. First, the climate agreed wonderfully well with mamma, who had spent several summers there in her early married life. Secondly, it was retired and obscure, and in it we could be of the world forgetful and by the world forgot. Thirdly, it was a very cheap market, a consideration of no small weight with people like ourselves, whose castles were all in Spain, and whose rent-rolls were airy nothings. And lastly, several of Mr. Percival's friends were spending the summer in the village, and being the happy mothers of numerous small responsibilities, they had promised me their patronage during their sojourn.</p>
               <p>Of society permanent, Exham could boast of but little, and that little was very uncongenial to us. The sole noble family that it laid claim to had been absentees for many years, and there was no prospect of their returning in as many more. All of the cream of the society called upon us soon after our arrival, but our deep mourning, and mamma's continued indisposition, prevented anything like sociability, even if I had felt inclined to participate in their enjoyments. And thus, with very little trouble, we gained the unenviable reputation of being "proud and scornful;" and ere long we came to be dropped from the visiting lists of the Exham exclusives. This at the time inflicted no pain upon me. I could not like the people: they were thoroughly uncongenial: a new revelation of humanity: and I found the cessation of their well-meant civilities a positive relief. I had not then discovered that the employment of a laborer depends more upon his popularity than his intrinsic worth.</p>
               <p>I <emph>was</emph> proud. I could not stoop, without a visible effort, to the low level of their minds and ambitions. I could not listen, breathless with curiosity, to the scandal and gossip of the village, nor interest myself in the private life, the daily sayings and doings, of my neighbors. I could not lend the young females any new patterns, or teach them "any new stitches."<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5979-00000015"/> I could on no occasion or invitation tease them about their positive or supposititious lovers; nor could I submit, without manifest reluctance, to have my raiment not only closely inspected and openly commented upon, but actually priced! And I could not receive, with smiling complacency or bridling coquetry, the coarsely-expressed admiration and vulgar attentions of the over-dressed and under-bred young men.</p>
               <p>When we came to Exham, the news of our being reduced gentlewomen had preceded us, and the community, by common consent, had resolved to patronize us. But patronage was not exactly to our taste, and when we persistently declined all overtures tending thitherward (which, I must own, was oftener done by me with flushed cheeks and lifted crest than with mamma's cool, high-bred composure), we came, in the estimation of the villagers, to merit the bestowal of that epithet which, in the vocabulary of the middle classes, bears a sort of plague-smitten significance—we were "proud." Consequently, we were to be "snubbed" and slighted, in season and out of season, through the charitable (Heaven save the mark) design of "taking us down," as some of the fraternity elegantly phrased it. The absurdity! A Tressylian humbled by the petty slights and rudeness of village <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parvenus!</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>I laughed with genuine merriment over the first of these exhibitions; but, after some bitter lessons, I found that, if it was impossible for a Tressylian to be humbled by such people, they nevertheless had it in their power to make the descendants of that haughty house suffer many an unimagined privation. You see, as I said before, I did not know then that our daily bread depended on the favor of these people, whose ill-will I had excited, certainly with no malice prepense, but also as certainly with very little compunction. Had I been acquainted with that important fact, doubtless, for mamma's sake, my haughty head would have bent more humbly to receive the crown of thorns which it was destined to wear.</p>
               <p>At first my success in obtaining pupils was all that I could wish. While the summer visitors remained I had as many as I could teach, and my intercourse with their lady mothers was pleasant and congenial. The close of the season speedily taught me how much I had been indebted to them for the possession of current funds.</p>
               <p>I had been offered the situation of governess by several of the ladies for whom I had been teaching, but I could accept no situation that would separate me from mamma. And when my summer friends<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5979-00000016"/> departed, summer friends they proved to be, for I never saw or heard from them again.</p>
               <p>The months slowly wore away. I had but little local patronage, and for that little I was indebted to my moderate terms. My pupils were all unlovable, and oh, what weary work it was,—day after day, the same monotonous routine. Inducting thick cockney tongues into the liquid mysteries of the soft Italian and musical Spanish languages: enduring a vulgar English accent and detestable grammar through page after page of interminable French exercises. But these afflictions were light compared to the auricular agony of the music lessons. I was passionately fond of music, and possessed a nervously sensitive ear, and I had to contend, not only with native ill-taste and inharmoniousness, but with the most vicious faults of style, imparted by some thousandth-rate instructor.</p>
               <p>I had to go to my pupils, and they all lived at inconvenient distances from me and from each other. I was away from home nearly all day, and as our means did not warrant the hiring of any style of conveyance, I was often exposed to the extreme of fatigue and bad weather. At first it was all very trying, but, in a certain sense, it was good for me. The necessity for such active and distracting exertion drew my thoughts away from myself, and prevented my falling into a state of morbid depression to which, by temperament and circumstances, I was prone. And the unfailing delight of mamma and Nurse Becky each evening at my return, kept me humanized and gentle, and saved me from brooding morbidly over the rudeness and dislike so constantly exhibited towards me by my scholars, few, if any, of whom really liked me. Parrot-like, they caught up the words of their elders, and repeated them with sundry juvenile and malicious additions, rarely or never addressed directly to me, for the most of them held me in no little awe, but said to one another in places where I must needs overhear them. And although never a voluntary listener, I none the less verified the old adage; and had my ears been made of inflammable material they would have subjected me to a conflagration very soon after my assumption of the duties of that much-put-upon and enduring individual, a daily governess; or, as my lady patroness, Mrs. Green, styled me, "the young woman who <emph>did</emph> the children's French and music." Had she said the victim who, by stress of fortune, endured the children's French and music, she would have phrased it more accurately. But accuracy was a foible which Mrs. Green disdained. Weakminded folk, who had the fear of God and man before their eyes, might limit themselves to strict veracity,<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5979-00000017"/> and forswear exaggeration in all its hydra-headed forms; but what advantage was it to have a ready, inventive faculty and an unscrupulous tongue, if one never said anything more than their neighbors? Thus the matter presented itself to this strong-minded female, and that she acted upon her convictions one day I proved to my cost.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>AUTUMN deepened into winter's dreariness; and one morning, a cold, raw, drizzling day in December, just as I was preparing to start out on my daily rounds, the postman brought us an express letter, announcing the extreme illness of our beloved Mr. Percival. This news was a bad invigorator for a day of trying work, and when I reached my first pupil I found that I was half an hour late.</p>
               <p>An ill wind blew for me that day, and everything went wrong. The lessons were all badly prepared; the children more than usually trying; and, before I started to my last place, a blinding, nervous headache came on to fill up the measure of my woe. The pupil to whom I was then going was my particular aversion. She was the very impersonation of all that is most displeasing in upstartism, utterly unchildlike, and unbearably common and uninteresting. Her mother was the queen of Exham society, the rich<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5979-00000018"/> widow of a retired pork-dealer; coarse, vulgar, and overbearing, the very sight of her was odious. From the first there had been an armed neutrality maintained between us, destined this day to break out into open hostility. Instead of being shown into the school-room, as usual on my arrival, the maid asked me into the back parlor, where Mrs. Green stood in awful majesty, surrounded by an admiring crowd of satellites, composed of the one footman, the two maids, the cook, poor relation, and six interesting olive-branches, all gathered, as I soon discovered, to enjoy the thoroughly English pastime of baiting a governess. My salutation was received with silent disdain, and Mrs. Green sounded the attack by saying, crushingly,</p>
               <p>"Do you know, ma'am, that you are one hour behind your regular time?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," I replied, with audacious serenity; "I was detained at home rather later than usual this morning."</p>
               <p>My composure acted like water on Greek fire, and she blazed out:</p>
               <p>"Well, miss, I don't approve of this here plan; I don't think it's respectable—(doubtless the good woman meant respectful)—in a public servant—such, I take it, a paid governess is—to keep them as hires her a-waiting a whole hour to take a lesson as they pays lawful money for."</p>
               <p>She paused here to take a satisfactory survey of my annihilated condition, thus charged upon by horse, foot, and dragoon, and perhaps to rally her forces for another attack.</p>
               <p>The Tressylian temper was rising hotly; the woman's manner was so insulting, and the audible tittering of children and servants did not serve very materially in restoring my equanimity. I opened my portemonnaie and took out five guineas, saying, with uncontrollable haughtiness,</p>
               <p>"After to-day I was to have given Miss Green four lessons. Permit me to pay you five guineas for the privilege of discontinuing the lessons altogether, and at the same time terminating our acquaintance very decidedly."</p>
               <p>I laid the money before her as I spoke, and, bowing profoundly, turned and left the room. She rushed after me, pouring out a torrent of invective as long as I was in sight.</p>
               <p>Blinded by indignant tears, I did not notice what direction I took until I had gone more than a square out of my way. And when I turned to retrace my steps, I found that the rain, which had been falling all day, had changed into a storm; the wind was blowing heavily, and the rain freezing as it fell. The comfort of my long walk was not<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5979-00000019"/> heightened by this elemental outbreak, for the wind drove the rain in blinding sheets full in my face, making it almost impossible for me to keep my feet or see my way. More than once I had to anchor by a lamp-post to catch my breath and regain my wavering balance; and at last, reeling under the shock of an unusually fierce blast, just as I turned a corner I struck against some object, and would have fallen but for the outstretched arms of the obstacle, which proved to be a gentleman, who said, courteously,</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, madam, and sincerely hope you are not hurt."</p>
               <p>"Not in the least, sir," I said, as I withdrew from his arm. But if I was not hurt, I was thoroughly exhausted, and as soon as his supporting arm was removed I reeled to and fro.</p>
               <p>"Pray accept my arm again; this storm is too severe for a lady to brave alone, and I shall be very happy if you will allow me to see you safely sheltered from its violence before I leave you."</p>
               <p>His tone was so courteous, and I so conscious of my inability to reach home unaided, that I said,</p>
               <p>"If you will be so kind as to see me to Rose Cottage, sir, I shall accept your offer very gratefully."</p>
               <p>"With the greatest pleasure, madam. I presume I have the honor of addressing Miss Tressylian?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," was all the response for which I had breath.</p>
               <p>"And I am Dr. Charles Stuart, very much at your service, now or at any future time," he answered, pleasantly.</p>
               <p>The storm was now raging furiously, and our walk was terrible. Sustained by his strong arm and sheltered by his tall form, I could scarcely preserve my equilibrium, and sometimes, when we crossed a street, he more than half carried me in his arms. We reached home at last, I completely exhausted, and both of us nearly frozen. I was drenched with rain, but Dr. Stuart, wrapped in India-rubber leggings and a thick waterproof, had escaped that evil. His waterproof cloak had been "a bone of contention" between us the whole way. Whenever we reached a sheltered corner, where I could hold on to a wall while he divested himself of it, he would insist upon wrapping me in it, and I as pertinaciously refused to permit any such gallant self-sacrifice. He accepted my invitation to come in and shelter himself for the night from the raging storm which was momentarily increasing; and while he paused in the hall to lay aside his wrappings I went at once into the sitting-room to relieve mamma's anxiety. Dr. Stuart came in soon after, and I had just presented him to mamma<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5979-00000020"/> when the heat of the room, combined with my previous agitation and fatigue, overcame me, and I lapsed into insensibility. The swoon was a brief one, and immediately upon my recovery I was summarily put to bed, given a composing draught, and ordered to keep quiet—a command that I was ready to obey, for I was one throbbing pulse of pain, and the one wish that I was conscious of entertaining was a longing for profound darkness and silence.</p>
               <p>The next morning I was too ill to rise, and found myself regularly booked as a patient for my chance-made acquaintance, Dr. Stuart.</p>
               <p>My illness held me a prisoner for two weeks—no inconsiderable loss of time to a daily governess, and in the end destined to prove irreparable; for I lost my pupils as well. My magnanimous enemy, Mrs. Green, lost no time in publishing the story of my enormities, garnished with all the coloring and embellishments that her very exuberant and by no means fastidious fancy could supply. The story grew and throve; the black spot spread and widened until my moral aspect wore a hue of Satanic darkness. The whole community got ready in righteous haste to wash their hands of such a wretch as I had proved to be; and when I was well enough to resume my duties I had no duties to resume. Some of my patrons were "not at home" when I called, and "begged that I would not trouble myself to come again;" others "would send me word when they were ready for me;" and a few told me rudely that they had no use for "such as I." Like the wedding guests in the parable, each one had some excuse at hand, and one went to his farm, and another to his merchandise, and <emph>all</emph> left the hapless strangers whom God had placed in their midst, to starve or not, as they could compromise with fate and that sternest of necessities, an empty purse. I made light of the loss to mamma, and prophesied that ere long they would return to their senses and their governess alike, though privately I entertained very faint hopes of any such felicitous event. I say felicitous, because, although I had found teaching very disagreeable, I found it far more unpleasant to do nothing, when that also meant to make nothing.</p>
               <p>But while Mahomet was waiting for the mountain to change its nature and come to him, he could not afford to be idle; and I, personating the Prophet for the nonce, was fain to turn my hand to something else. I therefore took out my long-disused easel and portfolio, and began to paint a series of local pictures, which nurse took to the bookseller's and exposed for sale. But my pictures, though pretty and well-painted (for my artistic talents had been carefully<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5979-00000021"/> cultivated), pleased the community as little as my manners, and remained unsold for many a long day. And, when finally purchased, it was not to Exham liberality or taste that I was indebted, but to the friendship of my good friend, Dr. Stuart, who merits a far more elaborate notice at my hands than he has yet received, or than my poor powers can bestow upon his many virtues.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>DR. CHARLES EDWARD STUART was, as his name indicates, of Scottish birth, and collaterally descended from the kingly, but hapless house, whose name he bore so worthily and well; for no Stuart who ever filled the throne, knightly as many of them were, ever covered a more kingly heart beneath his royal robes than beat in the breast of that stainless gentleman whose name I write.</p>
               <p>He had been educated as a physician, but the early death of his older brother rendered him independent of all need of personal exertion for his support. A marked talent for the profession, however, led him to practise it <foreign xml:lang="ITA">con amore,</foreign> and he was a not undistinguished practitioner, both at home and abroad. His residence had been in London, where he gave up much of his time to hospital practice, and over devotion to his duties had produced in him such physical and nervous depression, that he did that rare thing<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5979-00000022"/> for a medical man to do—put himself in the hands of a brother Galen for treatment, and actually used the remedies prescribed; which demanded, among other things, a total abandonment of professional life for at least two years, and an unlimited quantity of sea-bathing and mental rest.</p>
               <p>Acting in conformity to this advice, Dr. Stuart purchased a lovely residence near Exham, and devoted himself to sea-bathing, and not a little to the care of sick bodies, and in many cases sick souls, amid the poor of the neighborhood.</p>
               <p>His wealth made him the target for all the matrimonial shafts that scheming mammas and ambitious daughters could level at him, but he had attained his thirtieth year with his peace of mind undisturbed by any of the fair ones arrayed against him.</p>
               <p>With the poor and unfortunate he was universally a favorite, for no appeal to his charity was ever made in vain. Indeed, his was one of those rare, fine natures, that high and low, rich and poor, alike turn to and trust in; his charity was so broad and deep, his soul so pure and guileless. He was not handsome, in the ordinary sense of the term, but his face was one which women and children trusted intuitively. His large, clear eyes, set under a broad, fair brow, and with such a frank, true expression in their violet depths, were the only beautiful feature in his face, except indeed his mouth, whose firm, delicate outlines gave you at once an idea of mingled strength and sweetness. His well-shaped head was covered with thick, curling, brown hair, and his tall, sinewy form was well built and symmetrical. But it was in his expression that his chief beauty lay. Never had a woman blushed beneath his gaze, or felt that she could not trust implicitly to the purity of his noble manhood; a purity that shone in his dark violet eyes, and rested in the delicate curves of his lips and cheek, whose fine oval was clearly cut and sharply outlined from his neck; with none of the full, sensual melting of one into the other, that marks the grosser type of men; and yet he was essentially masculine, brave, tender, and true-hearted. He was not brilliant intellectually, though he was a deep thinker and a close student; not fascinating, but better than either, true. You would never be deceived by him, never disappointed in him; what he seemed to be he was; and in this world of trickery and time-serving, I take it there is no higher praise to be bestowed.</p>
               <p>His religion was as simple as a child's, and as profound as the source from which it sprang. To fear God, to visit the sick and afflicted, and to keep himself unspotted from the world, was the rule of his<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5979-00000023"/> faith and practice. Like Benhadad of old, he proved that he loved God by loving his fellow-men. A noble, Christian gentleman! would that the world held more like him!</p>
               <p>With such a man, our informal acquaintance was not long in ripening into actual friendship. He visited us constantly, and his presence made the sunshine of our cloudy lives. His royal blood insured him staunch adherents in Tressylians. And if Stuart blood was cold and ungrateful in by-gone times, years had worn off those blemishes, and left only the fine, high traits that instinctively we attribute to a noble and kingly race.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>THE news from our friend Mr. Percival continued to be very distressing. His illness had been so severe, that as soon as he could travel, his physicians ordered him abroad, and so all hope of aid and counsel from him was at an end, and our affairs were fast becoming hopelessly involved. The purse, unreplenished since my illness, was getting alarmingly low; and although how to refill it was a problem that I nightly gave myself to solve, each morning would find it still involved in hopeless obscurity. One evening, Dr. Stuart called to say good-bye, as he was going to London for a short visit. A sudden inspiration seized me, and when he rose to go, I said, as the evening was temptingly fine, I would accompany him a short distance. It took but a moment for me to add a hat and gloves to my costume, and soon we were out of sight of the cottage.</p>
               <p>I never had the cowardice or patience—whichever<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5979-00000024"/> it is—to defer a necessary evil. Whatever I had to endure, I wanted to take at once; and so, with a hot flush of mingled pride and shame upon my cheek, I said abruptly,</p>
               <p>"I did not come out for a walk, Dr. Stuart: I have a favor to ask of you."</p>
               <p>I stopped as abruptly as I had begun. It was so hard, after all, to tell him what I wanted. If he saw my pain and embarrassment, he was too kind to notice it, and answered with his usual gentle courtesy,</p>
               <p>"Anything, Miss Helen, that lies in my power, I will take the greatest pleasure in doing for you. What is it that I am to have the honor of serving you in?"</p>
               <p>"You will not find it much of an honor," I said, with a faint smile. "I wish you to place this in the hands of some jeweller, to be disposed of for me."</p>
               <p>I placed in his hands, as I spoke, a small mother-of pearl box containing a beautiful diamond ring, my dear father's last birthday-gift to me, and which had seemed too precious to part with when I gave up the rest of my jewels. He looked at me in some surprise, and said: "Shall it be disposed of at once?" "As soon as possible," I said quickly, and then added, after a moment's pause—</p>
               <p>"We are, unfortunately, under the necessity of living, Dr. Stuart. I can get nothing to do, and therefore have no means of supplying wants which will arise despite their inconvenience. I shall never wear jewels again, so the ring had better be converted into something that will prove a cement for the souls and bodies, which otherwise are in some jeopardy of being forced to dissolve copartnership."</p>
               <p>The smile with which I spoke was contradicted by a tear I could not repress; and as I turned away to hide another and another, Dr. Stuart took my hand with kindly sympathy as he said:</p>
               <p>"I will not prove unworthy of the confidence you honor me by placing in me, and you may depend upon my doing all I can to forward your wishes."</p>
               <p>He said good-bye, and though I watched him walk away through tears, I turned home with a lighter heart than had beat in my bosom for many a weary day.</p>
               <p>Alas! what humiliation it is to feel how completely the material overbalances the spiritual in our daily life; how the lack of means to supply mere bodily wants can depress the whole being. No intellectuality, no philosophy, will sustain the sinking heart with which we count over our slender store, and find it all insufficient to supply the pressing needs, when some helpless and beloved object is to share with us<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5979-00000025"/> the privation thus entailed. To bear our own suffering takes only a little fortitude—the flesh is easily subdued when the will decrees it; but to teach the loving heart to submit is a far harder task. The dry morsel that you could eat with indifference were you alone to consume it, is washed down with bitter tears when you note the effort with which some dear one swallows it. And oh! the choking agony of those meals which no self-denial will render palatable or sufficient for our nursling. I have often thought how many channels of human woe would be staunched did we but possess the pelican's fabled privilege of feeding our beloved ones with our blood. Ah! how often would thrilling pulses joyfully be drained. But fate, with the refinement of cruelty, strikes us through them, well knowing that the keenest pain to us will be the sight of their sufferings which we are powerless to avert. A single effort of the will enables us to bear unflinchingly the quivering of the javelin in our own flesh; but what philosophy can teach us that stoicism when the dart finds our heart through the bosom of those we love?</p>

               <p>A WEEK of absence elapsed and Dr. Stuart returned and resumed his friendly intercourse with us. At the close of his first visit he placed a sealed envelope in my hand, which contained a sum in crisp bank-notes that far exceeded my estimate of the value of the ring. Forthwith I flew to nurse to consult with her regarding its expenditure. We had grown to be great economists, nurse and I. She was primeminister of the finance, and, I often thought, keeper of the privy-purse as well, for I was convinced that the small sums she received from me could never, unassisted, have accomplished all that she wrought with them. Poor nurse! she was so proud of me and for me, grieving constantly over my secluded life, chafing over my privations, and never for one moment allowing me to do anything beneath the dignity of "the family." Any petty shopping that was to be done she always undertook, finding on such<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5979-00000026"/> occasions an indispensable necessity for fresh air. But if the bill was a large one, or the purchase some dainty trifle for mamma, then I must go. There was no appeal from the decision: nurse, by no system of arrangement, could make time to go herself. Whenever I could appear in the character of a lady of ample means and elegant leisure, nurse was not only willing but anxious that I should go forth and exhibit myself. But let there be the remotest danger of a lowering of the Tressylian crest, and then I was rigidly incarcerated. Dear, faithful soul! in that Better Land a crown of rejoicing surely waits for thee!</p>
               <p>A few days after Dr. Stuart's return, the rector of the parish, a strange, forbidding, solitary man, whose face had a sad history written in its cold, stern lines and fiery, hazel eyes, came to offer me the situation of organist in his church. He was a man of few words, and the arrangement was speedily made between us. But I did not know until long afterwards that the salary attached to the position was paid by my best of friends, Dr. Stuart, and then the discovery was the result of my accidentally finding one of the receipts among his papers.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>SPRING crept slowly away, and summer had deepened into autumn, and I was still without employment. Mr. Percival remained abroad, too shattered in health to attend to any business, and our affairs were rapidly approximating a state of such attenuation as forbade us to expect support from them. Mamma, from whom we rigidly kept all knowledge of our pecuniary difficulties, would often gently chide me for my grave face and urge me to walk out oftener, and I would force a smile and jest, when the ways and means of obtaining the next week's supplies were involved in Cimmerian darkness. Piece by piece, the handsome articles of my wardrobe found their way into other hands, and thus we eked out a slender subsistence.</p>
               <p>Late in the autumn, Mr. Percival wrote to tell me of a ray of light that would dawn for me in the spring. A Mrs. Aubrey, the wife of the English<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5979-00000027"/> minister at the Neapolitan court, had been ordered by her physicians to return to England to recruit her health, impaired by the excitement and strain of diplomatic life. She would arrive in the spring to take up her residence at Seaforth Court, the ancestral seat of her family, the De Veres. My interest in these details proceeded from the fact that Mrs. Aubrey had a little daughter for whom she was desirous of obtaining the services of a first-rate governess, and Mr. Percival had recommended me in unmeasured terms to her. He did so the more readily because Mrs. Aubrey was a perfect lady, and the little girl very amiable and intelligent. This prospect relieved me of some of my anxiety for the future, though the present grew even darker than before.</p>
               <p>A change in the weather, combined with some slight imprudence, had given mamma a severe cold, which, instead of yielding to treatment, rapidly increased in violence, and culminated in inflammation of the lungs. She was desperately ill, and for weary weeks I hung despairingly over her, and prayed with wild entreaties for her life. After many days my prayers were granted, and she crept slowly back from the valley of the shadow of death; and one day Dr. Stuart said to me,</p>
               <p>"I have done all for your mother, Miss Helen, that medicine can do. I must now leave her in the hands of the cook."</p>
               <p>I thought bitterly of our empty store-room and exhausted purse, and memory swiftly reverted to the pantry at Tressylian Hall, where every luxury that fancy could demand or wealth procure was stored with such lavish abundance. And now the simplest delicacy, no matter how longingly craved, was unattainable. Truly, "the life of the poor is the curse of the heart," as the wise king of Israel wrote long ago; and its bitter fidelity to nature I daily proved when the sternest self-denial, the most rigid economy that nurse and I could practise, did not avail to supply the many wants that illness and a fickle appetite entailed. Mamma gained no strength, and Dr. Stuart prescribed port wine. Tincture of rubies would have been nearly as attainable. I gave nurse some rare old lace which had lain on the snowy bosoms of the daughters of our house for countless generations, and was now my sole relic of better days, and bade her sell it, and buy the wine. Of course, our necessities were taken advantage of; a mere pittance was allowed for lace whose richness and antiquity made it worth more than its weight in gold, and, as a necessary sequence, a most indifferent article of wine had to be procured. On his next visit, I saw Dr. Stuart examine the bottle,<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5979-00000028"/> and then set it down with an expression of dissatisfaction on his face. Shortly after he left his servant came, bringing two dozen bottles of superb wine, accompanied by a very graceful note to mamma, begging her acceptance of what had been a present to himself, but, as he never used wine, he could only make it serviceable through the medium of his friends. A few days later he told me mamma needed the richest and most nourishing food to enable her to regain her strength.</p>
               <p>"Your suggestion is impracticable, sir," I said, bitterly; "I have no means to procure such things."</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon," he answered kindly; and that evening he rode over to bring a brace of pheasants. And every day, for many weeks, he would either bring or send presents of game or fish. I was deeply grateful for his kindness, but oh! it galled me so! If it had not been for mamma, I could not have accepted such favors, even from his kind hand.</p>
               <p>The Exhamites were right, after all. <emph>I was proud.</emph> And instead of that uncanny quality being rubbed out by the grinding at the wheel of stern necessity to which fate subjected it, by way of moral suasion, it throve apace and grew stronger under its servitude. Like the rebel flower, it flourished most when most trampled down.</p>

               <p>WINTER had vanished, and spring was just decking the earth with golden buttercups and blushing daisies, when the <title>Daily Gazette</title> announced, with a flourish of trumpets, the arrival of the Hon. Mrs. Aubrey, etc., etc., at Seaforth Court; and two days later, a groom, in plain livery, brought me a note from the lady, requesting me to call at my earliest leisure, as her state of health forbade her the pleasure of coming to me. The next morning was my "earliest leisure," and I arrayed myself in all the magnificence of shabby mourning, and prepared to set forth on my quest.</p>
               <p>I had been so long unused to society that I felt a nervous dread at the thought of facing strangers; and mamma's scrutinizing survey of my costume, and smothered sigh as she turned away, were not very reassuring. I knew I looked unfashionable, nay, even shabby; for my mourning had never been renewed,<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5979-00000029"/> and now showed evident tokens of long service. I was not Cinderella, with a fairy godmother to come to the rescue and supply all deficiencies; so I had to wear the rubbed bombazine and rusty crape, and trust to my being a lady to give it the needful style. And so I kissed mamma with a gay, jaunty air, and set out on my walk with as cheerful a deportment as if I were the best dressed woman in England.</p>
               <p>The distance between Seaforth Court and Rose Cottage was not inconsiderable, but the road lay through a very pleasant country, and as I was a very rapid pedestrian, my fleet steps soon brought me to my destination. The grounds were ample and beautifully kept, and the house, large, ancient, and rising abruptly from the water's edge, in sight and sound of the restless, moaning sea, was full of charm and interest. It had been a castellated fortress in the olden time, and, perched on its craggy cliffs, had laughed to scorn many an attack by sea and land, and its stout defences had once sheltered the hapless Henrietta, as she fled with her children from the blood-stained murderers of the royal martyr. Full of pictures, tapestries, and memorials of by-gone ages and countless generations, it was a treasure-house I was never weary of exploring, when I heard from lips, whose rich music lent them half their charm, the recital of daring deeds, devoted loves, and dark traditions, of this old stronghold of the "virtuous De Veres."</p>
               <p>A servant met me as I approached the house, and showed me into a beautifully-furnished morning-room; and, with the information that his mistress would join me directly, he withdrew.</p>
               <p>In a few moments Mrs. Aubrey made her appearance. She was a small and remarkably pretty woman, having about her the unmistakable air of good birth and good society. She was one of those warm-hearted, guileless little creatures who win you at sight; with graceful, simple manners, touched with a dash of child-like dependence, that appealed at once to the heart of a stronger nature. We have all met that appealing helplessness, that clinging dependence, which seems to ask for strength and shelter in the love of a deeper soul. Such natures are very sweet and attractive. They are not capable, perhaps, of the silent endurance, the resolute self-sacrifice, which glorifies the lives of some women: they may not tread so unflinchingly the roughest pathways, or resign as unmurmuringly the glories of youth and love, to stretch themselves upon the thorny cross of a life of toil and duty; but they make sunshine in many homes, and often win the crown of love which would have smoothed the most rugged path, brightened the darkest trial, for<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5979-00000030"/> some toiling Martha, whose very strength of endurance, whose resolute assumption of hard duties, often shuts her out from the love of men. For men look for something soft and clinging upon which to lavish their tender care, and are oftener repelled than attracted by a woman who seems able to stand alone; not looking back—shallow, superficial reasoners that we all are—to the fact that it was some masculine shirking of duty which forced a woman into his place, who shrinks, they dream not how shudderingly, from the post she needs must hold; and battles, none know how wildly, with loathing disgust and soul-sick weariness of the life she leads.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Aubrey's manner to me was charming, and I had been with her some time before I remembered that I had come on a matter of business, and not to make a morning call. We were chatting gaily about everything except my errand, when the mantel clock struck, and the entrance of a servant with the luncheontray recalled me to myself. My flush of embarrassment and hasty apology were smilingly disregarded. Mrs. Aubrey would receive no excuse, and declined to listen to anything serious until after lunch.</p>
               <p>When the tray was removed, I said, Mr. Percival had led me to hope that I might be employed as Miss Aubrey's governess.</p>
               <p>"Yes; Mr. Percival arranged the articles of treaty with me before I left Naples, and they only wait your approval to be complete. I am afraid you will find my little girl sadly spoilt and willful—the one ewe lamb is rarely managed, you know—but if you will only make her like yourself, I shall be more than satisfied," she answered, heartily. And then, noticing that I looked grave at what sounded like such open flattery, she added, ingenuously,</p>
               <p>"Don't look so shocked. I did not mean to flatter, or even to judge of you by what I have seen this morning. I am too much of a diplomat for either. I was thinking of what Mr. Percival had said of you, when I spoke."</p>
               <p>I smiled, and answered lightly, "You must not take me at Mr. Percival's estimate, or you will find me terribly overrated."</p>
               <p>"I am willing to risk it," she replied, smilingly.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes all the preliminaries were decided. I was to come over to Seaforth Court every day, and devote five hours to the instruction of Miss Aubrey in the English branches, French, music, and embroidery. She already spoke Italian like a native. And for these manifold duties I was to receive a salary that far exceeded my most sanguine hopes. I was to begin my new duties the ensuing week, which left me a few<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5979-00000031"/> days of leisure to rejuvenate my dilapidated raiment. Mrs. Aubrey had insisted on paying my first quarter's salary in advance—to make sure of me, she playfully said; but I attributed the arrangement to what she could not fail to see were my necessities.</p>
               <p>I did not see Miss Aubrey, who was out in the grounds with her nurse; and in truth she was a sight that I not a little dreaded. I had felt too keenly how much power to be entirely hateful and unbearable can be lodged in the small compass of a child's body, to have any wish to encounter a small damsel whom a partial mamma was forced to describe as "very spoilt and willful." She, however, was to be my trouble, and the result would be increased comfort for mamma and nurse. So I plucked up heart of grace, and, bidding Mrs. Aubrey <foreign xml:lang="FRA">adieu,</foreign> started home with rapid steps. But ere I cast anchor in that dear haven, I touched at the grocer's and the butcher's, and expended some of my newly-acquired treasure for such substantial joys as a fine steak, some potatoes, and butter. And at last home again, to relate all my adventures, and dilate on the manifold charms of my new acquaintance.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <p>THE next day was Wednesday, my regular evening for practising in the church, and quite early I went over. I was passionately fond of sacred music, and when my regular practising was finished I glided into some grand old anthems, and their sonorous cadences rose and fell like waves of melody until the dim arches rang with the jubilant strain, and the very air quivered with harmony. With my peculiar temperament, I ought never to have been allowed to touch a musical instrument, for my taste amounted to a passion, and the indulgence of it was a joy so akin to agony, that I have often left the instrument in a state of complete nervous prostration, every fibre of my being strung to its utmost tension, and tears much nearer the surface than smiles. This evening the spirit of melody was strong within me. I was perfectly attuned; and it was not until sunset stained the western windows with<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5979-00000032"/> its dying glories that I closed the organ and rose to depart. As I reached the vestibule, Dr. Stuart joined me.</p>
               <p>"How exquisitely you played this evening, Miss Helen. I never heard you do yourself full justice before," he said, as we left the church.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you were rewarded for your trouble in coming to hear me," I answered.</p>
               <p>"This is by no means the first time that I have drank stolen waters," he said, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Indeed! pray, when were you here before?"</p>
               <p>"Almost as often as you have been," he said, quietly.</p>
               <p>"Why, Dr. Stuart, is it possible?" I exclaimed in surprise.</p>
               <p>"Don't be vexed, Miss Helen. I did not think you would care. You play for me whenever I ask you, so it can make no difference," he said, deprecatingly.</p>
               <p>I smiled at his contrite tone, as I replied:</p>
               <p>"I don't think you could do anything that would vex me; but you must have found it dull work after the first evening. I should think one essay would have satisfied your curiosity."</p>
               <p>"I had no curiosity to satisfy," he said, in a tone of annoyance.</p>
               <p>Not a little surprised at his tone, I asked, quietly:</p>
               <p>"What motive induced you to come, then?"</p>
               <p>"Love," he answered, passionately, as he turned and caught my hand. "Yes, Helen," he continued, in reply to my look of blank dismay, "I love you as dearly as a woman was ever loved; and I cannot be happy unless you consent to be my own dear little wife. I have long wanted to tell you this, but I lacked the courage until now. I know I am a plain, unattractive man, but I love you with a depth and tenderness that no man can surpass. You are the only woman who has ever heard such words upon my lips. To you I have given my whole heart, with an entire devotion that can know neither change nor decay. Such love as mine must kindle a responsive feeling sooner or later. Helen, dearest Helen, will you not be my own?"</p>
               <p>"Dr. Stuart," I answered impulsively, "you do me too much honor. Believe me, this declaration was wholly unexpected. I have never once thought of you save as the dear, kind friend to whom my obligations are countless. I do love you dearly, but only as a friend. I never thought of your caring particularly for me. It all seems so new and strange; and perhaps, after all, you are mistaken as to the real nature of your regard."</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5979-00000033"/>
               <p>He smiled a little at my simplicity, as he replied, earnestly:</p>
               <p>"I am quite certain that I have made no mistake as regards myself. I have long known that you are the only woman in the world who can make life complete for me. I love you with all the strength of a heart that has but few ties, and that never loved before. And Helen, although the thought of me as a lover is a new one to you now, in time you will be accustomed to it. Cannot you promise to think of what I have told you, and learn to love me, if you can? I will wait months or years, if you will only try to love me. Tell me, dearest, is the promise more than you can give?"</p>
               <p>His voice, tremulous with deep feeling, touched me strangely. I stood doubting and deciding, while his grasp upon my hand grew absolutely painful in the intensity of his suspense, and then I said frankly,</p>
               <p>"I certainly do not love you now, Dr. Stuart, and perhaps I will never be able to give you the love you ask for; but I love you dearly as a friend, and may-be the deeper feeling may come. I therefore neither accept nor reject your suit. Let it be as though you had never spoken; and if you are willing to wait an indefinite time, and risk a rejection after all, I will promise to think of what you have said, and learn to love you, if I can. Will this arrangement suit you?"</p>
               <p>He did not reply directly to me, but the earnest kiss he pressed upon my hand, and a low-breathed "Oh Father, I thank Thee," spoke more eloquently of his earnestness than many words could have done.</p>
               <p>But little was said by either of us as we walked home through the clear twilight. Dr. Stuart was too much in earnest to be master of many words, and I, not a little embarrassed by the turn affairs had taken, was speculating whether or not I could learn to love him. I certainly meant to try.</p>
               <p>Fool that I was, and blind, to think that love could be learned as a lesson, or come as the growth of will. Affection may be cultivated, fondness may be the habit of years, but love! ah, that guest comes unbidden to every human heart, and tarries there at will. No persuasion can entice him to enter, no force can dislodge him. Had I better known the mysteries of that wondrous thing, the human heart, my very quietude and uncertainty might have taught me that he had no power to stir the deep places of my soul. No chord thrilled beneath his touch; no pulse quickened at his approach. I met his glance unshrinkingly; I parted from him with no pain. I loved him, but I could never be in love with him, and<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5979-00000034"/> between the two there is bridgeless, immeasurable space.</p>
               <p>When I told mamma that night what had occurred, she evinced so little surprise, that I asked her wonderingly if she had suspected it before?</p>
               <p>"The only wonder, daughter, is that you, with a woman's intuitive perceptions in such cases, did not see it as plainly as I did. I am sure he came often enough to make you fancy that the cottage held some special charm for him."</p>
               <p>"But I thought he came to talk to you, mamma; I did not dream that he liked me especially."</p>
               <p>"Mamma is not so attractive to every one as her foolish little girl thinks she is," she answered fondly.</p>
               <p>"Mamma, would you like me to marry him?" I asked shyly, after a brief silence.</p>
               <p>"Very much, if you loved him, dearest; for he is a truly good man, and would make a wife who loved him very happy, as I told him when he asked permission to address you."</p>
               <p>"Why, mamma, you knew all the time what an Alexander I had become, and did not tell me," I said playfully.</p>
               <p>"Because, if I had, my shy little bird would have taken fright and never allowed her captive to plead his cause," she answered with a smile.</p>
               <p>'Twas quite late when I kissed her and withdrew; and soon I was sleeping as quietly as if Fate had not unclewed one of the cross-threads of my destiny, and placed it in my unconscious hand—a thread that was to prove the chain-anchor by which I held in the wild storms that broke over me; and though often obscured by mists of tears, still to be the guiding-line that led me into the still waters of peace.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>THE day at length arrived upon which I was to begin my new duties, and punctually at ten o'clock I presented myself at Seaforth Court, and was shown into the schoolroom, where Miss Aubrey awaited me.</p>
               <p>Miss Aubrey seemed an absurdly formal title, when I beheld the witching little sprite who bore it. She was as full of pranks and mischief as a kitten, and as wild and wayward as the most tricksome elf that ever danced fairy rings upon the moonlit sward. She had just attained the discreet age of ten, and was, in her own opinion, the most mature and dignified of females. She was singularly precocious—as children become who live much in society—and a very pretty creature, with a skin as fine and colorless as a lily-leaf, save the vivid carmine in her lips, and large wistful eyes that had stolen the purplish splendor of the Tuscan violets; while her soft, brown hair, touched with the gold of Italian sunsets, clustered in silken masses around her fair neck and brow. A most attractive child, although, as her mother frankly owned, very wilful and spoilt. I had a battle-royal with her on the third day of my reign, in which I taught her the hitherto unmastered lesson of submission to "the powers that be." She was a queer little mixture of stubborn pride and tameless courage, but as I was the concentration of patience and resolute will, the little maid soon found it lost labor to dash herself against a rock. My victory was not complete until I had gained her love, and that done, the contest between us was at an end. Born under a southern sky, she yielded herself up to love with all the passionate self-abnegation that characterizes the children of the sun-kissed climes. In a short while my influence over her was unbounded; my lightest wish was a law as inviolate as the code of the Medes and Persians. A grave tone and averted glance was the heaviest punishment that I need inflict: a smile and kiss a reward sufficiently ample to repay any exertion. She was such a quick, ready scholar, that my duties were never irksome, and my position soon became one of unmixed pleasure.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Aubrey lost none of her charms through the oft disenchanting medium of daily intercourse, and<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5979-00000036"/> we soon became warm friends. An intimate I could not have: my nature was too reticent and deep-flowing to find verbal outlets. I could not bear to talk about myself; but I could listen with sympathy and interest to others, and be confided in even while I made no confidences in return. Sincere and trustworthy, I had the faculty of lifting the veil that shut the world from the heart of my friends, and penetrating to their deepest recesses: and yet no hand was strong enough to turn the key which locked up my inner life.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Aubrey was a woman of warm affections and quick, vivacious intellect, but, unfortunately, her temperament was so nervous and excitable that the least continued strain upon her mental powers reacted alarmingly upon her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">physique,</foreign> producing a state of nervous prostration pitiable to behold. Her husband's high diplomatic position necessitated their entertaining hosts of guests; and the constant whirl and excitement of political life had so completely shattered her, that, at the imperative decree of her medical attendants, she had been sent to England to rest. All society had been rigidly interdicted until such time as her authoritative physicians saw fit to declare her out of danger; and consequently she led the life of a recluse, seeing no company and holding no intercourse with the Exham world. She did not even employ a local practitioner, but telegraphed to London whenever she desired professional advice. And thus Seaforth Court was a little world in itself, for the very servants—who were mostly foreigners, by the way—held themselves aloof from the villagers, and could never be inveigled into a friendly dish of gossip.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Aubrey was a frequent visitor at the cottage, and whenever her health would permit, she spent the morning with mamma, and thus beguiled many hours that otherwise would have hung heavy on the dear hands which had now become so helpless—for mamma was a confirmed invalid. She had never recovered from the effects of her illness, and seldom left her couch, except when Mrs. Aubrey would take her for a quiet drive along the sands, or Dr. Stuart would carry us all over to spend some Saturday at his beautiful home. His attentions to me were quietly devoted, never obtrusive, but never lacking in a nameless influence which made me conscious all the time of his unabated love. He was always so genial and pleasant, and so devoted to mamma, that I was beginning to think with quiet content of one day becoming his wife. And thus in dreamy sweetness the days glided away until the earth was blushing with June roses,<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5979-00000037"/> and the long, low swell of the blue waves upon the silvery beach told of summer's calm advent.</p>
               <p>But not a cloud arose in the clear azure sky to warn me that the stormy season of my life had come.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>ONE evening, near the close of June, I went alone to the church to practise. Dr. Stuart usually accompanied me, but this afternoon something prevented his doing so, and I went alone—a circumstance too trivial in itself to merit comment had it not influenced my whole future life. I had just received some new music, and some of it was so beautiful and difficult that I was tempted by the pride of power to remain much later than usual, and when I descended from the organ-loft the sun was setting. As I reached the door the ruby splendor of the sky shone full upon me, and I paused in breathless delight to watch its changing glories. The rose and purple tints had blended into dun, the gold was fading, and the last crimson flush was paling out as I turned away with a sigh. It was re-echoed near me so profoundly that I turned hastily, and met the dark, earnest gaze of a pair of singularly brilliant eyes. A tall, stately figure, a long, flowing<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5979-00000038"/> beard, and a generally foreign air, were all that I could distinguish; for the person was standing in the shadow of one of the massive columns that supported the organ-loft. I flushed in spite of myself, at the steady scrutiny to which I was subjected, and, as a hint to the inquisitive stranger that he might leave, I closed one leaf of the heavy folding-doors. He accepted the suggestion, and, walking past me, lifted his hat, bowed deeply, and disappeared.</p>
               <p>I hastily locked the door and hurried home, wondering not a little who the distinguished-looking stranger could be. Mamma was so apprehensive about my being out alone that I did not mention this incident to her, fearing to increase her uneasiness, but I privately determined the next time I went alone to lock the church doors, and prevent the possibility of another such adventure.</p>
               <p>When I reached Seaforth Court the next morning, a servant requested me to walk into the library, where his mistress was waiting for me. Mrs. Aubrey rose as I entered, and, after greeting me warmly, said:</p>
               <p>"Allow me the pleasure of presenting my brother, Colonel De Vere, to my friend, Miss Helen Tressylian."</p>
               <p>A gentleman advanced as she spoke, and I looked up to meet the same brilliant gaze that I had encountered tered the evening before in the church. He smiled at my flush and start of surprise, and said pleasantly,</p>
               <p>"We are not absolute strangers, Miss Tressylian. I had the pleasure of seeing you once before."</p>
               <p>"Why, Colonel, where?" asked his sister in surprise.</p>
               <p>"In the church, last evening," he replied.</p>
               <p>"And why did you not tell me of it?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Because the occurrence was not sufficiently marvellous to warrant a history," he answered lightly.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Aubrey turned to me and said:</p>
               <p>"My brother arrived very unexpectedly yesterday, Helen, and to-day Lillian petitions for a holiday; will you give it?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, if you wish it," I said.</p>
               <p>"But she will only have it on condition that you will stay all day, otherwise I doubt if even 'Uncle Edward' would reconcile her to your absence." And turning to her brother, she continued, "You don't know what a witch this young lady is, Colonel; she has enchanted the whole establishment, from myself to the gardener's boy."</p>
               <p>"I have no doubt of it; I thought her a stray seraph yesterday, and watched to see her melt away with the sunset," he said playfully.</p>
               <p>Just then Lillian rushed into the room like a small<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5979-00000039"/> whirlwind, and her mingled caresses and entreaties effectually precluded conversation until I had promised to remain as long as usual.</p>
               <p>As soon as that point was settled, the little maid curled up on a cushion at my feet, and listened contentedly and comprehendingly to the gay and varied conversation which soon sprang up between us "grave and reverend seigniors."</p>
               <p>Colonel Edward De Vere was a man not unknown to fame. As an officer in the Indian campaigns, he had covered himself with glory, and had been honorably mentioned by the Home Department, "for extreme gallantry and meritorious service." He was covered with medals and orders, both foreign and English, for his military services had not been confined to his native land. France and Austria had both presented him with swords and regiments, and his life had been one of restless activity and daring.</p>
               <p>In him I met the soldier, the scholar, and the gentleman. He was in the full prime of his life, and singularly attractive, not only from his extreme physical beauty, but from a strength and intensity of nature, a freshness and vigor of heart and mind. Although the suns of thirty-eight years had bronzed his cheek, he moved with all the elasticity and spring of extreme youth, and bore his honors as lightly as his years. His manners were elegant, so exquisitely refined and courteous, fragrant with the aroma of high birth and breeding, and gilded with the winning grace which springs only from a noble and chivalric heart. He was tall and well-formed, with a profusion or rich, dark hair covering his shapely head. His brilliant hazel eyes looked out from beneath straight black brows, whose raven hue contrasted strongly with the broad, fair forehead above them. A rich brunette complexion, bronzed by sun and wind, and yet retaining enough of its pristine delicacy to show the dusky blood that surged into it, whenever he was swayed by passion or excitement; splendid white teeth, that gleamed through his thick, curling, black moustache, and a long, silken black beard, gave him a markedly foreign and distinguished appearance. He was a strikingly elegant-looking man, and showed the genuine thoroughbred, from the imperial carriage of his stately head, down to his small, shapely feet. His voice, slightly tinged with a foreign accent, was wonderfully soft and rich, with a sort of harp-like depth and swell, that made his lower tones indescribably melodious. There was a depth of passion and tenderness in the man that, if stirred, made his lightest word a caress. Surely you have heard such voices, whose tones linger with vibrant melody upon the ear,<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5979-00000040"/> and reach into the heart, until its sweetest chords quiver with ecstasy, long after the words that set them thrilling have died into the blank, voiceless silence which is the grave of sound.</p>
               <p>There are some men whom, once known, it is impossible to forget: whose intense individuality impresses itself indelibly upon all who come in contact with them; and who will be idolatrously loved or bitterly hated, according to the sympathy or repulsion existing between themselves and the natures they encounter, but who never inspire a mere negative sentiment, and seem to defy you to forget them; having about them some strong subtile emanation of power, the intensity of will, and perhaps some dormant mesmeric influence, which weaker souls intuitively recognize as their master, and yield to with love or loathing, as the case may be, but never with indifference. Such a man was Colonel De Vere. As if by instinct I fathomed his nature, and when we parted that evening, I felt as if I had known him for years. And yet our conversation had been as surface-like as possible, touching once or twice upon the outskirts of some grave topic, and then glancing, swallow-like, from shade into sunshine, from flower to flower.</p>
               <p>After a late luncheon I rose to depart. Colonel De Vere accompanied me to the edge of the grounds, and when I paused to say good-bye, he said,</p>
               <p>"I have a favor to ask of you, Miss Tressylian, which is, that you will be so kind as not to mention my arrival to any one. I have not revisited this place since I left it as a boy, many years ago; and as my stay will be very uncertain, I particularly wish to remain undisturbed by the good people of the village, whose interest in me is doubtless extinguished by my long exile. Can I depend upon your kindness to keep my secret?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, sir, to the strictest letter of the law. I hold no intercourse with the Exhamites, and so will not be tempted to betray you," I responded.</p>
               <p>"Thank you. I shall depend upon your silence," he said, as he took leave of me.</p>
               <p>It was a promise simply asked and thoughtlessly given, and of the bitter fruit it was to bear, how could we dream? Had it been a crime deliberately planned and wilfully committed, its punishment could not have been more terrible.</p>
               <p>I found Dr. Stuart playing chess with mamma, and, being absorbed in that most unsociable game, neither asked me any questions respecting my day's adventures, and I finally retired, without telling her of Colonel De Vere's arrival.</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5979-00000041"/>
               <p>There lay my great error. I had taken the first step in the hidden path that was destined to lead me to such a heritage of woe. And yet, my silence was but the result of an over-strained sense of honor. I had promised to tell no one, and my morbid truthfulness did not allow me even to except mamma. There could be no tampering with a plighted word by a daughter of the "Trusty Tressylians."</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>IT is impossible for me to describe how much my life brightened with the coming of Colonel De Vere. I saw him daily; for, under the pretext of his being lonely, and herself but an indifferent companion, Mrs. Aubrey threw us constantly together, and I found him a very agreeable break in the monotony of my life, while his ever-recurring allusions to the speedy departure that he must take, took away all doubt about the propriety of keeping mamma in ignorance of his arrival. Why interest her in a guest who would tarry but a day?</p>
               <p>He was a man of fine natural abilities and extensive cultivation, and, having been a great traveller, his fund of incident and adventure was unlimited. To me, whose whole life had been spent in two retired places, his conversation was strangely fascinating. He could tell me so much that books could not, and in a<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5979-00000042"/> few graphic sentences make a place a vivid reality, which before had been merely a geographical abstract. And he was fresh from and familiar with the great living world of men, whose life meant action, incident, and conflict with shifting scenes and countless actors; not a pulseless vegetation, a dull drifting on stagnant waters. And I pined for an active, eventful life; I chafed silently, but ceaselessly, at my dull, narrow circuit, whose only change was from one stage of pain or privation to another. And then Colonel De Vere's views were all so broad and large-minded; there were no narrow places, no bias cuts in his soul; all was liberal, frank, and generous—almost too liberal on some points, but that was attributable, not so much to a tendency in himself towards free-thinking, as to the cosmopolite life he had led; and the constant attrition with his fellow-men had necessarily rubbed down all points and squared all circles of national prejudice. And yet, beneath his gay <foreign xml:lang="FRA">débonnaire</foreign> manner there was an undercurrent of sadness, almost cynicism, which seemed to show itself against his will, and impressed me with the belief that there had been hard lines and sharp angles in his life. This always latent trait developed into open sneers whenever human nature was the topic of discourse. Once I had nearly asked him what experience of his fellow-men men had given him the right to hold them in such bitter contempt; but I thought, if a wound was festering beneath his brilliant armor, the most merciful course was to leave it untouched. I could not heal it, and my unskillful pressure might only make it bleed afresh.</p>
               <p>His religious views were very peculiar, more closely resembling the old Egyptian theory of metempsychosis than any system of modern theology that I have encountered, either among men or books. The doctrine of eternal punishment, or what he called the monstrous doubt that a God of justice and mercy would lay an infinite punishment upon finite beings, he indignantly rejected on what, I must admit, were plausible and fair-seeming grounds, though, of course, if measured exactly by Biblical rule and square, they would prove untenable. Once, when we were discussing some point of religious belief upon which we differed widely, but which was one of the anchors of my faith (it was the doctrine of the foreknowledge of God in connection with human free agency), his line of argument was so powerful and sophistical that I exclaimed, impetuously, "Oh, hush! the belief comforts me; I will not give it up."</p>
               <p>"Pretty enthusiast!" he said, smiling rather sadly, "if it is ignorance, why cling to it?"</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5979-00000043"/>
               <p>"If ignorance is bliss, or even a greater measure of comfort, is it wisdom to be wise?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Child," he answered, and as he spoke a profound gravity shadowed both face and voice, "dream on while still you may, and believe anything, no matter how bigoted or inconsistent, if it only requires the exercise of faith, rather than become what I am, a waif on the sea of speculation, drifting aimlessly about with neither rudder nor compass, ever seeking, ever doubting, and unable to say truthfully that I believe one single tenet of the Christian faith."</p>
               <p>He left the room as soon as he finished speaking, and the subject was never renewed between us. But that revelation had let the light into many of the dark places of his mind which before had baffled me. And oh! what a weary waste it made all life to him; for no matter how careless and irreligious a human soul may be, there comes to it at some time the consciousness of its own immortality and the need of a Divine arm to rest upon. And when this necessity is pressing upon heart and soul, when everything has given way beneath us, and the whole earth is reeling and unsteady, if the soul is struggling blindly in the dark waters of unbelief, what refuge can it find secure enough to shelter it from the storm of its own despair?</p>
               <p>From that day Colonel De Vere's name mingled in my every prayer. I pitied him so deeply; for each day, as my intimacy with him increased, I saw that, strive to hide it as he might, he was a most unhappy man. Unlike the melodramatic type of men, he did not pin a label upon his breast and stalk through life with a gloomy brow and tragic mien, saying in word and manner, "Behold a smitten man!" But he drew over his wound the mantle of proud reserve, and strove by a gay, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">insouciant</foreign> manner to conceal the fox that gnawed upon his vitals.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5979-00000044"/>
               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <p>COLONEL DE VERE'S manner towards me had always been particularly pleasant. Now a change indescribable, but unutterably satisfying, came over it. He seemed to fill a blank in my life of whose existence I had been unaware until the exquisite contentment which became mine proved that it had ceased to exist. I never thought why I was so happy, or how his coming had made me so. I simply accepted the fact, content to revel in the sunshine without seeking to penetrate to the source of its light.</p>
               <p>Mamma watched me fondly, delighting in the buoyant step and gay laugh that brightened our home. At first, I found the restraint of being unable to speak to her of Colonel De Vere both wearing and painful; I was constantly on the eve of mentioning him; but, after a while, it would have been a far greater effort to speak of him than it was to keep silent. I did not realize why it should be so; for he was ever in my thoughts, mingling with every dream, coloring every fancy.</p>
               <p>Often, in the silent watches of the night, have I shivered with a strange delight at some remembered glance or tone; and, for the first time in my life, I gloried in my personal loveliness, because I was fair in his eyes. Of course, like a man of the world, he had paid me countless compliments; but I had attached no value to them, merely ascribing them to his continental gallantry. But one day, to justify her own extravagant admiration of me, Lillian quoted her uncle's declaration that I was the most exquisitely beautiful woman he had ever seen. I rebuked my little worshipper for repeating a speech not meant to reach my ear, but all the while a king's ransom could not have purchased a single charm that won his admiring glance.</p>
               <p>And yet, it was not mere personal vanity. I had often been told by mamma and Dr. Stuart that I was beautiful, but, beyond the momentary pleasure of hearing it, I had never given the matter another thought. But now each clustering ringlet, each roseate tint, each snowy curve and winsome dimple, held a value not of themselves, but of the eyes that held them fair. Ah, youth and love! how strange, how sweet they are! And the rose-crowned, nectar-filled chalice was<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5979-00000045"/> so soon to be dashed from my eager lips, 'twas well that I should quaff its full intoxicating sweetness.</p>
               <p>One day I had been late in leaving home, and therefore did not leave Seaforth Court until the sun was setting. It was one of those rare, delicious days in September, when mere existence is a joy. The deep sapphire sky was flecked with fleeces of snowy clouds, whose lower edges the setting sun had deeply tinged with gold. In the west, shining through bars of rose and purple splendor, lay a sea of molten gold; and, lower down, staining the distant hills with its blush, was a belt of crimson clouds, melting on the horizonline into a clear greenish light, which served but to intensify its ruby tints. The heaving sea was flushed with the reflected glory, and far away, sounding softly over the incarnadined waters, came ever and anon the faint music of a bugle boat-horn.</p>
               <p>I paused upon the colonnade, and gazed in voiceless ecstasy upon the glowing sky.</p>
               <p>Colonel De Vere was standing beside me, and soon his melodious voice broke the impassioned stillness as he repeated, with exquisite taste and expression, those beautiful lines from Tennyson's Princess: <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"The splendor falls on castle walls,</l>

                        <l>The long lights shake across the lake,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And the wild cataracts leap in glory,</l>
                        <l>Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying;</l>
                        <l>And echo answers echo, dying, dying, dying.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Oh hark, oh hear, how thin and clear,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And thinner, clearer, farther going,</l>
                        <l>O'er cliff and scaur are heard afar</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">The horns of Elfland faintly blowing:</l>
                        <l>Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying;</l>
                        <l>And echo answers echo, dying, dying, dying.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Ah, love, they die in yon rich sky,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Or faint o'er field and flood and river;</l>
                        <l>Our echoes roll from pole to pole,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And live forever and forever."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The deep liquid flow of his voice ceased suddenly, and I looked up. His brilliant eyes were bent upon me with the most passionate tenderness in their glowing depths, and his face, flushed and eager, wore an expression that no woman could fail to understand. I felt the crimson surge into my cheeks, and turned my face away, as he caught my ungloved hand in both of his, and held it for one moment in an ardent clasp. The next instant he suddenly released it, and stepped back with a sigh so bitter, that, despite my embarrassment, I glanced towards him, and was startled at the change that these few seconds had wrought in his appearance. Every tinge of color had faded out of his face, leaving it rigid and ashen; and his eyes, late so<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5979-00000046"/> glowing, were full of the deepest gloom. This change was inexplicable to me, and became more so when he turned abruptly and left me without even saying good-night.</p>
               <p>For the next three days I scarcely saw him, and when we did meet his manner was cold and constrained. This alteration in him made me bitterly unhappy, though I was far too proud to show it, maintaining all the while an air of cheerful serenity and light-heartedness which was quite the reverse of what I felt. But so intense was my pride, that I would have died sooner than betray an atom of the depression that held me in its relentless clutch.</p>
               <p>On the fourth day, as I sat in the library preparing a model for Lillian's drawing lesson, Colonel De Vere came in and began to pace the floor. He was saying nothing, and his presence made me so nervous that I made several false lines in my drawing. Just as I perpetrated the crowning enormity he paused beside me, and, looking over my shoulder, said drily,</p>
               <p>"That drawing will not be suitable for a model, Miss Helen; the perspective is wrong."</p>
               <p>I tried to rectify the defect, but as he stood watching me, I succeeded so ill that I laid my pencil down, and said, lightly,</p>
               <p>"I can accomplish nothing better, Colonel De Vere, as long as you stand beside me watching for failure. That air of critical severity would discompose Michael Angelo himself. What have I done that your sachemship should dig up the hatchet and set out on the warpath with an appetite whetted for scalps?"</p>
               <p>"You have done nothing: the fault lies with me," he answered, <emph>brusquely.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Then let us bury the hatchet and forget all about it," I said, simply, as I held out my hand to him.</p>
               <p>A deep flush mounted to his very brow, as he pushed my hand almost rudely away, and said passionately—"Child, child, you tempt me."</p>
               <p>A pause, awkward and painful, ensued, and then he seated himself beside me, saying quietly,</p>
               <p>"Give me your pencil, Miss Helen, and as I am to blame for the faults in your work, let me see if I cannot correct them."</p>
               <p>I held the crayon towards him in silence, and he took both it and my hand, saying gently,</p>
               <p>"Forgive, and, if you can, forget all that has lately passed; and believe, despite my wayward temper, that my regard for you will know no change."</p>
               <p>There was a grave tenderness and sincerity in his voice and manner that carried conviction with it, and completely banished my late pain and doubts. So supreme was my faith in him, that his lightest<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5979-00000047"/> world would have stilled the wildest tempest of doubt that could have arisen in my heart; his simple assertion or denial would have outweighed any one else's oath. My trust in him was supreme, boundless, entire. "Perfect love casteth out fear, for fear hath torments."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <p>THE days swept by unmarked by any incident, with no ripple on the surface to show how much the current was deepening in this calm.</p>
               <p>During this time, from the first of July, Dr. Stuart was in Scotland, where he always spent four months of the year, visiting his estate and his relatives, for he had the true Scottish love of kith and kin. Leal and True was the motto that should have been inscribed on the shield of that knightliest of gentlemen. He wrote frequently to mamma, for whom his affection appeared to be tender and sincere. But who could fail to love my beautiful, gentle mother? or to admire the dignity and fortitude with which she bore her changed estate?</p>
               <p>Our domestic affairs were on a far more comfortable scale than they had been. My salary was very liberal, and every day a basket of fruit, vegetables, and flowers, was sent over from Seaforth Court. The flowers were<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5979-00000048"/> always arranged by Colonel De Vere, whose taste as a florist was perfect, and mamma often praised the gardener's skill so highly as to make me feel downright disingenuous. It is a strange thing to me, how, loving mamma as dearly as I did, I could possibly keep her in ignorance of a person who interested me as deeply as Colonel De Vere; for I was naturally of a frank, open disposition, and never had a secret from her in my life, until this one. But if a person has ever withheld a confidence that another had a right to expect, the longer it is delayed the harder is the task of making it at all, and such was the case with me. I had delayed the communication from day to day, out of a false sense of honor; and finally it became so involved with my private feelings, that I found it impossible to be made.</p>
               <p>The style of life at Seaforth Court underwent no alteration, and I often wondered if Colonel De Vere did not find its monotony insufferable, accustomed as he was to so much change and variety. One day I asked him if, wearied with its sameness, he was not pining to take flight. He smiled rather sadly as he replied,</p>
               <p>"If you had knocked about the world as much as I have done, Miss Helen, you would not find this sweet home-life monotonous. It is such a rest, so delicious an interlude in my nomadic career, that I dread to think that, like all human joys, I must ere long resign it, and renew my Ishmael wanderings in places whose charm familiarity long ago extinguished, or fight battles in which I have no interest, and in which I have nothing to win or lose. Should these days be in store for me—and my dread of them is deep enough to be prophetic—I will look back upon this time as a traveller in the African desert recalls the oasis he has left, when nothing spreads out before him but a dreary, blinding waste of sand."</p>
               <p>In the deep melancholy of his tone I recognized anew the undercurrent of sadness that I had detected before, and I felt that I had unwittingly touched upon his unknown grief.</p>
               <p>It had become a habit with us, during Lillian's hour of recess, that one of us should read aloud for the benefit of the others, and the task usually devolved upon Colonel De Vere, and at this time we were reading Jane Eyre. It was a half-holiday, decided upon after my arrival. Lillian was out walking with her nurse, and we had just settled comfortably to our embroidery and reading, when some dispatches arrived by express for Mrs. Aubrey, which required an immediate reply. She went at once to her chamber, and left Colonel De Vere and myself alone. He had been reading some<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5979-00000049"/> time, and had reached that part of the story where Mr. Rochester is explaining his conduct in attempting to marry Jane while his wife was still living. Then he closed the book, and said, in a strangely eager tone,</p>
               <p>"Miss Helen, was Rochester very much in the wrong?"</p>
               <p>"Of course he was—selfish, dishonorable, and criminal," I said, decidedly.</p>
               <p>His face flushed as he said quickly, "You are a severe judge. There were palliating circumstances that you do not take into consideration."</p>
               <p>"Palliating to some extent, I grant, but not justifying. He was not to blame for the mere loving her, but he was selfish and dishonorable in trying to betray her into a marriage which he knew was a mockery, and for that part of his conduct I see no excuse," I answered quietly.</p>
               <p>Colonel De Vere sprang to his feet and began to pace the floor with rapid steps, speaking impetuously, even passionately.</p>
               <p>"You are hard and unmerciful in your judgment. In all the strength of untempted virtue, you make no allowance for his love and human weakness; you forget how miserably he was fettered; he was not inexcusable; any man, every man, would have acted just as he did."</p>
               <p>"Then Heaven grant, if all men are like Rochester, all women may be as brave as Jane Eyre," I said, very gravely, answering as much his manner as his words.</p>
               <p>He came and stood before me, saying hurriedly, "Helen, would you condemn as unsparingly in real life as you do the fictitious sin? Would love and wretchedness find no pity in your eyes, if they yielded to the pressure of fierce temptation?"</p>
               <p>There was something in the agitation of his voice and manner that touched me with a thrill of strange agony, and I said, rising as I spoke,</p>
               <p>"I do not care to make such a discussion personal, Colonel De Vere. We will change the subject, if you please."</p>
               <p>I seated myself at the piano and dashed into an intricate German waltz, and when I finished it and turned from the instrument, Colonel De Vere had left the room, and I did not see him again that day.</p>
               <p>This incident, although I could attach no reasonable or probable meaning to it, haunted me for days, always coupled as at first with that strange thrill of nameless agony. Is it true that the weird sisterhood shadow forth upon our hearts the spectrum of some approaching woe? The theory is supported by many strange evidences, too numerous to be mere coincidences. But why, oh, why, darken our present<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5979-00000050"/> joy with the shadow of a future grief which we are powerless to avert? Why not let us dream out our brief hour of sunshine, with no consciousness of the cloud that is gathering to drench us in tears and gloom?</p>
               <p>Poor, blinded humanity! We are but Jonahs after all. Our gourd, though often only a gourd that came up on a night and perished in a night, was ours, and we loved it—ah! sometimes so tenderly loved it. And when God prepares a worm and smites it, we think "we do well to be angry," though the anger oft costs us another withered vine. But in the time of which I write, my heart was too gay and joyous to be long depressed by intangible griefs, and I soon recovered my light-heartedness, and the days passed by in unsullied brightness, in cloudless happiness, which I might have known had too little of earth's taint of sorrow and unsatisfyingness to last; for my heart felt, if my lips never framed the words, that "this world was good enough for me."</p>
               <p>Over this period of my life I well might linger. It was so bright, so beautiful, and, alas! so soon to be buried out of sight beyond even memory's right to "go to the grave and weep there." If it were worth while, I could repaint each scene as it occurred, recall the gay words and jests, the ringing songs and laughter ter, those little nothings that yet were all, and made the days so full of sweetness and sunshine. And the gracious woman and fair child, whose love was much to me then, and who were so soon to be lost forever in the maelstrom of agony which was even then gathered to engulf me, both come back at memory's weird command with words of love and tenderness, and bridge the chasm that yawns between these days and those; and I am again a glad, happy girl, wearing in my heart of hearts the kingly image that for years has stood in memory's halls with its face veiled and turned towards the wall, while my dying love wailed in its desolate agony and struggled wildly in the darkened chambers of my soul. <q>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <p>OCTOBER, queen of changing tints and royal colors, had arrived, and wood and wold were gorgeous with her rich livery. Bronze and gold, crimson and russet, reigned in the foliage, while golden gorse and purple heather gleamed on the distant hills and shadowy valleys. The brilliant court had just opened; not a single splendid tint had paled, when all glory died suddenly out of life for me.</p>
               <p>Late one evening a groom from Seaforth Court brought me a note from Mrs. Aubrey, in which she said, telegraphic dispatches from Naples necessitated her leaving the next night, and I must come over as soon as possible in the morning, and stay with her all day.</p>
               <p>Immediately after breakfast I walked over. Lillian met me at the hall-door in a passion of tears, weeping so bitterly that even I could scarce console her. Poor little maid! hers was not the only heart aching that day. It was trying to us all, and would have been unbearably so had we not been too much occupied to think much of our approaching separation.</p>
               <p>Colonel De Vere, who was to accompany his sister, was constantly with us, but he was gloomy and abstracted, and made no effort to conceal it.</p>
               <p>At last everything was packed, and it was nearly sunset. I had just parted with Lillian, whose grief was so extreme that I had to leave her mother to console her; my presence only increased her woe; so I went down-stairs to wait until Mrs. Aubrey could rejoin me.</p>
               <p>The library was empty when I entered it, and, overcome by the fatigue and excitement of the day, I sat down beside a table and gave way to tears. The next moment Colonel De Vere was kneeling beside me, and, drawing my head upon his breast, he said, in the softest tones of his exquisite voice, "Hush, hush, my darling; you must not weep, my own little blossom; I love you."</p>
               <p>Where, oh, where will I find colors rich enough to paint the rapture of that hour! It was joy sufficient for one life, enough to blot out all the past, to glorify all the future, have what it might in store. And as I rested upon his bosom, and felt his strong heart beating fast beneath my cheek, the almost uttered prayer,<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5979-00000052"/> "Now let Thy servant depart in peace," rose to my lips. The fullness, the perfection, of joy was in my heart; such joy as comes but once in a lifetime, and makes earth a heaven while it lasts.</p>
               <p>After the first kiss he pressed upon my lips but little was said. No words were needed to tell us how completely we belonged to each other; heart answered heart in one deep, raptured swell.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Aubrey's voice in the hall soon recalled us from the Elysian fields where we were straying, and Colonel De Vere rose from beside me. As his sister entered I also rose, and prepared to say good-bye. My adieux were finally over, and as I started to go, somewhat appalled at the lateness of the hour, Colonel De Vere said, easily,</p>
               <p>"It is so late, Miss Helen, that I cannot consent for you to go alone. I must really see you home."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Aubrey smiled mischievously as she whispered, "Oh, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">cara mia,</foreign> I shall be so glad!" and then, with a last kiss, she let me go.</p>
               <p>It was quite dark when we reached the green before the cottage gate. Colonel De Vere declined my shy invitation to come in, and we parted under the shadow of a giant oak. When at last I turned to leave him, he caught both of my hands, and said, pleadingly,</p>
               <p>"Helen, darling, you have never told me that you love me. Will you not say just once, before we part, 'Edward, I love you dearly?'"</p>
               <p>The task was a hard one, but after much pleading, eager and passionate, he had his wish. And then, clasped in his strong arms, so close that I felt each wild throb of his heart, he showered kisses upon my upturned face, and whispered words of sweetest love and tenderness.</p>
               <p>At length I broke from him, with glowing cheeks and thrilling pulses, and walked rapidly across the green to our gate. As I looked back I saw him standing like a dark shadow under the tree, watching to see me disappear. Mamma was sitting in the twilight, and I knelt beside her and told her of Mrs. Aubrey's plans, and regrets that she could not find time to come over and say good-bye. When I finished speaking, a familiar voice said, playfully, "Has the departure of new friends stolen the welcome of older ones, Miss Helen?" and Dr. Stuart stepped forward and held out his hand. I returned his greeting warmly, and jestingly parried his question. I was too happy to be other than joyous, and my mirth seemed contagious. Mamma and Dr. Stuart grew positively merry. Once mamma said, "Why, daughter, you are in such a gale. I thought parting with Mrs. Aubrey would depress you."</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5979-00000053"/>
               <p>I flushed consciously as I said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, mamma, you know I was born on May-day, when all the elves and fairy-folk have power; how can you expect me to behave like rational people, when such a moon is shining in the sky, and setting all my elfin blood to dancing?"</p>
               <p>I had half determined to tell Dr. Stuart that his suit was hopeless, but he was so gay and blithe that I had no heart to dash his hopes. My own love taught me to be pitiful for his.</p>
               <p>Two days after Mrs. Aubrey's departure, I received a letter from her, enclosing a little tear-stained note from Lillian, and telling me all about her journey and future plans. In a postscript she asked archly,</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <p>A WEEK later, early one afternoon, I walked over in the golden October sunshine to Seaforth Court. The hall-door was open, and I passed through into the library, and stood dreaming over the last moments I had spent in it, until they seemed to exist once more. So vivid was this impression, that I heard a familiar step, and looked up with scarce a shade of surprise to see Colonel De Vere, but so changed and haggard, that it seemed as if years, instead of days, had rolled over his head. Before I could utter a word he said impetuously,</p>
               <p>"Helen, I could bear it no longer; every mile I put between us only increased my wretchedness and guilt. I am a wretch, beyond the reach of pardon. You will hate and despise me, and I deserve that you should, but I must tell you all. And oh! Helen, pity while you hate me, for I am a married man!"</p>
               <p>I listened in blank uncomprehending dismay to his broken words; but when he uttered the last sentence, the room seemed to whirl round and round before me, and with one bitter cry, "Oh, the sin and shame!" I sunk lifeless at his feet.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>When I returned to consciousness, Colonel De Vere was kneeling by me, chafing my hands, and calling me by every tender word and name. With my returning strength came a rush of memory that made me withdraw from his encircling arms, and put his hand aside. He rose to his feet, and with bent head and downcast eyes, said entreatingly,</p>
               <p>"I know you hate and despise me; but, oh, Helen! in mercy listen to my justification."</p>
               <p>"Justification! there can be none," I exclaimed, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"To the palliation of my guilt, then," he said so humbly that I melted into tears. It was so hard to see my idol humbled before me.</p>
               <p>At the sight of my rain of tears he clenched his hands, saying brokenly,</p>
               <p>"Oh! my darling, do not weep. I am not worthy of these tears. Hate me, if you will; despise me, I know you must; but, oh! my darling, do not grieve over me."</p>
               <p>His voice, full of the most exquisite tenderness,<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5979-00000055"/> thrilled every chord of my soul, and, mastering my emotion, I said, as steadily as I could speak,</p>
               <p>"I have no wish to reproach you. I will listen to anything you wish to tell me. But you must remember henceforth that there must be no professions of regard made to me. Honor forbids it now."</p>
               <p>My involuntary sigh was echoed deeply as he seated himself on an ottoman at my feet, and thus began:</p>
               <p>"To make my explanation lucid, I must revert to the earliest years of my life, and show you all the influences that led me to the commission of an act whose consequences have blighted all my life.</p>
               <p>"My father was the sternest man I ever knew, and my childhood was very unhappy. My mother, God bless her! died at Lillian's birth, when I was just ten years of age, and the three succeeding years I spent at home were dreary beyond expression.</p>
               <p>"My father had conceived a strong dislike for me; why, I know not, unless, as is sometimes the case, he was jealous of me as the future successor to the honors and riches that gave his life its whole flavor and relish. He was a vain, arrogant man, ruling his subordinates with autocratic sway, and exacting the most servile compliance with his every whim. My temper was too like his own in haughty pride to yield him the complete submission he demanded, and this added additional strength to his dislike. He treated me with unrelaxing severity, until, worn out at length with his unkindness, I asked to be sent to a public school. My request was granted, though as ungraciously as possible; for instead of sending me to Eton or Rugby, as I had desired, I was dispatched to a German university, where I was to remain until I graduated; and, with a degree of petty malice worthy of a lower source, he made me an allowance so small as barely to cover my actual expenses, without leaving the smallest surplus for boyish indulgences.</p>
               <p>"I was haughtily proud and keenly sensitive; and as I could never return such civilities, I would never accept the least hospitality from my fellow-students, or accompany them to any place of public resort, confining myself to my own quarters, and prosecuting my studies vigorously. I was a ready student, and at eighteen I graduated with the first honors.</p>
               <p>"My father, on being notified of the fact, wrote briefly to inform me that I was at liberty to choose my residence for the next three years in any of the continental cities that I preferred, and, when informed of my selection, he would place a deposit with some banker for my support.</p>
               <p>"I cannot say that I was either surprised or hurt at his course. I rather enjoyed the thought of liberty,<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5979-00000056"/> and decided upon Paris as my future residence. I notified my father of the fact, and received in reply the address of the banker with whom my funds were lodged, but not a single word of parental advice, not one caution against the countless dangers and temptations which awaited my untried youth in that gay and licentious city. Young, ardent, and impulsive, utterly ignorant of the world's ways and wickedness, I was left to sink or swim, as fate dictated.</p>
               <p>"A few months after my settlement in very humble lodgings I was informed, through a London banking-house, that my maternal uncle, a wealthy East India nabob, learning that I was keeping an establishment in Paris, desired to add something to my income, and had deposited certain moneys with them for my yearly use and benefit. The amount sounded like unbounded riches to me, for heretofore I had been obliged to practise the strictest economy in the expenditure of every <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sou.</foreign> I immediately removed into handsome apartments in a fashionable quarter of the city, and, for the first time in my life, enjoyed the advantages that good birth and good fortune confer. I speedily had an extensive acquaintance, and, living in elegant style, I did not scruple to accept the invitations that were showered upon '<foreign xml:lang="FRA">le bel Anglais;</foreign>' and soon I had plunged, with eager relish, into the vortex of fashionable life, though not of fashionable follies. I was not vicious naturally, and my life had been so secluded and simple that I shrank with almost womanish loathing from vice and dissipation.</p>
               <p>"One night at the theatre, I saw, sitting alone in a private box, a lady whose marvellous beauty rivetted my gaze for the rest of the evening. When she rose to go I followed her, but the crowd was so dense that I did not reach the street until her escort had placed her in the carriage. He was an acquaintance of mine, and when I eagerly asked to be presented to his beautiful charge, he smiled at my enthusiasm, and said,</p>
               <p>"'If you can survive until to-morrow night, I will introduce you with pleasure. She will be at the English ambassador's ball, and, if you have cards, the occasion will be particularly felicitous, for, like yourself, she is a most beautiful dancer.'</p>
               <p>"'I have cards, of course; but why not call with me to-morrow morning?' I urged.</p>
               <p>"'Simply because it would be useless trouble. Madame, for some mysterious reason of her own, never receives in the morning,' he replied.</p>
               <p>"I had, therefore, to curb my impatience until the following night.</p>
               <p>"I went to the ball, was presented to the siren, and received by her with marked favor. She danced<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5979-00000057"/> repeatedly with me, and finally dismissed her escort most cavalierly to allow me the honor of seeing her home. When I reached my own rooms I was in a state of complete infatuation. I was only eighteen, remember, and this beautiful creature was the first woman I had ever fancied. My heart awoke with a bound, and I fell—yes, literally fell—blindly, madly, hopelessly, in love with her, or rather what I fancied her to be.</p>
               <p>"She was the childless widow of an Indian officer, and, except yourself, the most wonderfully beautiful creature that I have ever beheld. She was above medium height, with a figure full almost to voluptuousness, but so exquisitely proportioned that you scarcely saw the tendency. Her eyes were liquidly soft, her features regular and delicate. The vivid crimson of her velvety lips trenched upon the lily-like pallor of her silken skin, whose fairness was heightened by the superb coronal of raven hair that crowned her graceful head. Her voice was soft and low, her movements slow and dreamy. Indeed, there was a sort of delicious languor over the whole woman that was strangely attractive to a nature as restless and impetuous as mine.</p>
               <p>"She was not intellectual or cultivated—quite the reverse; but the most common-place remark made by such beautiful lips, and in that soft, rich voice, sounded like an inspiration.</p>
               <p>"I cannot paint in mere words the perfection of physical beauty, the nameless fascination she possessed. She was, in brief, one of those fatal Circean women who seem born to lure men to ruin. I never gave a thought to her age, in fact, I never thought of anything but herself when I was with her, and that was nearly all the time.</p>
               <p>"From the first she had distinguished me with peculiar favor; and when, after a month's acquaintance, I addressed her, she accepted me at once, and offered no opposition to my eager wish for an immediate union. After a brief engagement of two weeks we were accordingly married.</p>
               <p>"Completely carried away by mad passion, I thought of nothing but winning my wife, and omitted to notify my father of my matrimonial designs until several weeks after they had become an accomplished fact. In his reply to the letter containing the tidings, he said,—I remember every word,—</p>
               <p>"'If I did not know that your inconceivable folly will entail a far heavier punishment than my displeasure could inflict, I would never forgive you. As it is, I wish you joy of the treasure you were in such hot haste to secure. I knew the woman whom you<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5979-00000058"/> so dutifully ask me to accept as a daughter twenty years ago. I was a dangler in her train before you were born; and if your infatuation outlasts your honeymoon, you are a more absolute fool than I conceive it possible for a child of mine to be.'</p>
               <p>"Such was my father's congratulation upon my wedding; and, except that he was my father, it was pretty much what I deserved. That letter was the last he ever wrote to me. I wrote an indignant, and likewise ignorant, defence of my wife, and had it returned without a word of comment.</p>
               <p>"I need not tell you how my eyes were first opened to the extent of my folly. I had verified the old adage of 'Marrying in haste to repent a leisure.' And long and bitter as my repentance has been, I never tasted all its agony until now.</p>
               <p>"My wife was an opium-eater, which was her 'mysterious reason' for never receiving visits in the morning. It is a very common habit with persons who have lived in India and other relaxing climates; and a more debasing practice cannot be found; for while its deleterious effects develop but slowly in the physical system, it far outstrips all other intoxicating substances in the rapidity with which it vitiates and depraves the moral nature of its votaries.</p>
               <p>"I had not been married one year when I found my wife to be utterly unworthy of affection or esteem. She was ignorant, narrow-minded, and selfish; inordinately fond of society, and seemed to live only for mere sensuous pleasure. In a short while, even her splendid beauty palled upon me. She became to me a terrible impersonation of Coleridge's conception of the Lady Geraldine, in that strange fragment, 'Christabel.' I could fancy I saw the reptile soul beneath its beautiful flesh mask.</p>
               <p>"She was recklessly extravagant, as vain and selfish people usually are; and although she was heavily in debt when I married her, she did not scruple to increase her liabilities. But debt was a condition of affairs that my English sense of honor could not brook. And although she often found means to eyade my orders, I sternly set my face against her incurring obligations to tradesmen that I could not discharge. She might make me miserable, but she should not make me dishonest.</p>
               <p>"After a few years she began to fade—she was at least twenty years my senior—and, disappointed in many ways in her marriage with me, she began to resort recklessly to the use of opium. I endeavored to restrain her excesses, but my efforts were fruitless. She had learnt to hate me with all the venom of a narrow soul, and my interference resulted in nothing<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5979-00000059"/> but stimulating her to still greater indulgence in her terrible vice.</p>
               <p>"Bitter contempt had replaced the love I once felt for her, and my life was inexpressibly dreary. At last, convinced of her worse than worthlessness, I determined to separate from her. Had I been like other men I could have found distraction from my domestic sorrows in the world around me; I could have forgotten my unhappiness in the excitement of the gaming tables, or drowned the memory of it in wine. But my taste inclined to neither. I had, what seems to me to be rare even among gentlemen in these days, a strong sense of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">noblesse oblige,</foreign> a feeling of personal honor in preserving my moral integrity. Since I was a gentleman with sword and shield, I chose, for simple honor's sake, to keep the one stainless and the other bright; and this from no religious scruple, but mere personal pride. I would not condescend to degrading pursuits; and doubtless that intense pride had more to do than the world wots of, in winning for my race the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sobriquet</foreign> of the 'Virtuous De Veres.'</p>
               <p>"My father's death occurring at this time, put me in possession of ample means, and settling a sufficient income upon the woman whom I had married, I left Paris, and since that day I have never seen her face.</p>
               <p>"I was then only twenty-three; now I am thirty-eight: and in the fifteen years that intervened I have been a restless wanderer on the face of the earth. My foot has pressed every shore ever touched by a white man's tread. I have fought for Christian and Infidel, for crescent and cross, caring nothing which was right or wrong, only seeking to find in the mad rush of battle oblivion of my thrall. In India, Turkey, and Algeria, I have charged with the foremost ranks, hoping that some infidel cimeter would put a period to the life of which I was so weary.</p>
               <p>"I sedulously avoided the company of women, not because I had lost my faith in them; for while the memory of my gentle mother lingered in my heart, that I could never do; but for the reason that love was a necessity of my nature, and I dared not risk the formation of another attachment, fettered as hopelessly as I was. But as years crept slowly away, an apathy, which I took to be the advance-guard of old age, fell upon me. My heart seemed to be a closed volume, whose seal no fingers save those of Azriel might unloose. And after my long exile of twenty-five years, a longing to revisit my childhood's home possessed me. My sister intended revisiting England, and I begged her to make my house her home and I would join her there.</p>
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5979-00000060"/>
               <p>"She had grown up and married since we parted, I a lad of thirteen and she a dimpled babe of three. She was so young at the time of my marriage that she knew nothing save the bare fact that I had married neither wisely nor well; and when she heard that I had lost my wife, believed most naturally that she was dead. I did not undeceive her: not from any sinister design of taking advantage in any way of her misconception, but simply because it was very painful to revert to that portion of my life, connected as it was with scenes of such degradation and misery.</p>
               <p>"At length I came home, and walked through streets that had been unpressed by foot of mine for more than a score of years. Men looked me in the face and passed me by, unknowing and unknown. In the streets of my native village, in the domain of generations of my ancestors, no one knew me or cared for me. I was a stranger to them all.</p>
               <p>"It was nothing more than I should have expected. It was only natural that it should be so. As a boy I had always been kept at home, and but few of the villagers knew me. I had been absent a quarter of a century, and had grown from a child into a middle-aged man. And no one knew that I was coming home. So, altogether, it was most natural. But I own I was disappointed. I had no right to expect anything else, but I had expected it; and, at the time, the disappointment was most keen.</p>
               <p>"Lonely and desolate, I turned my steps to the church, meaning to visit my mother's grave. I had obtained the key of the private entrance from Lillian, and soon I was bending sorrowfully over the only familiar object that greeted my coming home. As I knelt beside her marble image, sadly recalling her lost love and tenderness, a voice of surpassing sweetness broke in upon the twilight gloom, chanting that grand old anthem, 'Comfort ye, my people.' I listened to the clear, liquid tones with a keen delight, which ere long melted into sadness; and soon bitter tears were raining down from fountains that had long been sealed. I had meant to leave the church before you came down, but when I heard your light step upon the stair, a sudden desire to see your face came over me, and I waited in the shadow of a column for your approach. If you remember, you stood in the doorway watching the sunset, and when you turned, its glory was shining in your eyes, and I saw your face 'as it had been the face of an angel.' From that moment, Helen, I loved you.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you read as much in my earnest gaze, for I saw the rose-flush in your cheeks deepen into crimson beneath my glance. Recalled to myself by your<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5979-00000061"/> lovely embarrassment, I left the church, and concealing myself behind the wall, I waited until you came out, and followed you home. When you entered Rose Cottage I knew that you were the peerless Miss Tressylian, whose praises the two Lillians had chanted in no measured terms.</p>
               <p>"It is needless to trace out in detail the growth of my love. From the first you filled the void in my heart and life. And, as I watched you, day by day, and saw your exquisite nature unfold like leaves from the heart of a rose, each hour developing some new grace and charm, I learned to love you with a passion as deep and ardent as it was hopeless. Over and over again, when I have parted from you, have I resolved to return immediately to the continent, and strive by action and absence to obliterate your image; and the next morning would find me still listening to your musical voice, still gazing upon your exquisite face, blindly trusting to my powers of self-control to conceal the passion I had no power to flee from or subdue.</p>
               <p>"But, Helen, believe me, I never for one instant dreamed of telling you of my love; and had I for one moment imagined that I was risking your happiness, I think, I believe, I would have had honor enough to leave you. But I never dreamed of such a possibility. With all the self-distrust of love, I thought I was too old and world-worn a man to win the regard of so young and innocent a heart. The sweet simplicity of your manners deceived me, and I looked upon you as some glad, happy child-woman, the current of whose guileless life was as yet unstirred by the unsealing of the deeper wells of passion and love.</p>
               <p>"My reasoning may have been shallow and sophistical; I may have believed there was no danger simply because I wished to believe it—for all men are selfish and self-indulgent, and I am but a man. But I was honest in one thing: I never intended to breathe one word of it to you. I could not govern my heart and eyes, but I could, or at least I thought I could, hold my tongue. Twice, however, the confession had nearly escaped me. You may remember one evening on the colonnade, and again when I was reading Jane Eyre, the very words were trembling on my tongue. Your exquisite dignity saved me then, and that night I determined to leave Seaforth Court forever; but, with the dawning of the next day's sun, my resolution vanished. I was like a moth fluttering around a flame, unable to resist its attractions, and yet conscious that it must be destruction in the end. I could not leave you. Man that I had<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5979-00000062"/> thought myself, from many a stern test unshrinkingly endured, I was weaker than a child where you were concerned. I had no self-mastery when it came to a question of parting from you.</p>
               <p>"The day of my sister's departure arrived, and I thought with mingled sorrow and relief that I had endured the ordeal honorably. Alas! I left the library when I heard you approaching, not daring to risk the private interview that I knew Lillian had planned; but with characteristic weakness I hid myself in the conservatory, where I could command a full view of you.</p>
               <p>"You cannot have forgotten the rest. The sight of your tears overcame every sentiment but love. I flew to your side, fully determined to express nothing but affectionate regret at the interruption of our friendship, and in the first sentence I found myself declaring the most ardent love. You did not repulse me. I realized for the first time that my affection was returned; and oh! Helen, I would have been more or less than man had I been able to deny myself the rapture of that hour. It was the first real joy that had been mine in more than twenty years, and it was not until we had parted that I realized what I had done. When the full tide of memory did rush back upon me, then, my own Helen, the tortures of Hell could not exceed the agony that I suffered in my wild remorse, my bitter grief for you.</p>
               <p>"That night I wrestled with my better nature hour after hour; sometimes resolving to marry you at all hazards, and then determining to keep you in ignorance of my marriage, and let our relations remain unbroken until death released me from my chain. The good finally prevailed enough to make me decide to tell you all, though, when I left, unsettled. But as mile after mile widened our separation, the memory of your trusting eyes and unquestioning faith reproached me so sharply that I determined to tell you all at once, cost what it might. I would not write. I knew if you loved me that my presence would soften the tidings, my lips tell the story more tenderly than a letter. And though to me a blind, voiceless medium would have been far easier, though I shrank with unutterable dread from witnessing the grief I had inflicted, I chose not to spare myself one pang.</p>
               <p>"As soon as I saw Lillian safe in her husband's care I hurried back, giving myself no rest by night or day, fearing my courage might flag. I was just going out to seek you when you came in.</p>
               <p>"And now, Helen, dearest, only beloved, you have heard all. Condemn me I know you must; but pity while you blame. My only regret, my sole remorse,<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5979-00000063"/> is but for you. The woman who was my wife long ago forfeited all moral, if not legal, claims upon me. I love you wholly, solely, entirely; and I will love you so long as life holds its own in the citadel of my heart. Nor would I have it otherwise save for your dear sake. I can never forgive myself the sorrow I have brought on you. But, oh! Helen, in mercy tell me you forgive it, and that, guilty as I am, you do not quite despise me."</p>
               <p>His low, musical voice, full of pathos and self-reproach, stirred the profoundest depths of my soul. For one moment right and wrong, moral and religious barriers, went down before the wild tide of human love and agony. I started up, exclaiming brokenly,</p>
               <p>"Forgive! despise you! how could I do either when I love you? I do not blame you in the least," and turning, I held out both my hands.</p>
               <p>He sprang to my side and took me in a close embrace, and unresisting I hid my face within his bosom, and sobbed with ever-deepening woe.</p>
               <p>Oh! how I loved him! My whole soul fainted within me at the thought that we must part. He had no power to comfort me, for his breast was heaving convulsively with his effort to subdue his emotion, and as he bent down to kiss me his burning tears fell fast upon my cheek. Oh! the fierce agony that sprang into life at their touch.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>At length conscience, that stern monitor, awoke, and as my passion of tears subsided I withdrew from his encircling arms. He made no effort to detain me. Indeed, there was a touching humbleness in his manner that was harder to be resisted than any words could possibly have been. As I turned to go, I said,</p>
               <p>"You will leave here immediately, will you not? for we must never meet again."</p>
               <p>"Never! oh, Helen—" he began.</p>
               <p>"Never," I repeated firmly. "It is wisest and best that we should part forever."</p>
               <p>He held out his arms with the most imploring gesture, and I, doubting my own strength to resist, turned from him and flew rather than walked out of the house, down the long avenue, and home, through the gathering gloom; never pausing to take breath, never daring to look back: uncertain whether the sounds that filled my ears were my own heart-beats or pursuing footsteps, I hurried on, and just at our gate fell almost exhausted in Dr. Stuart's arms.</p>
               <p>"Why, Miss Helen, what is the matter?" he asked anxiously.</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5979-00000064"/>
               <p>"Nothing," I gasped, as soon as I could speak. "Only it is so dark that I was frightened."</p>
               <p>As we entered the hall he said again,</p>
               <p>"You are so very pale; are you quite sure that nothing frightened you?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing but myself," I said, as carelessly as might be.</p>
               <p>Tea was waiting, and soon after they took their seats Dr. Stuart said to mamma,</p>
               <p>"I noticed the arrival of Colonel De Vere mentioned in a late London paper. I suppose he came over to meet his sister, for he seems to have expatriated himself completely."</p>
               <p>"I suppose he did," said mamma; and then after a pause she added,</p>
               <p>"I wonder if his wife is still living?"</p>
               <p>"His wife! why, I never heard that he had one."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; he was married when a mere lad to a very worthless and designing woman. She was a widow and many years the oldest; so it could only have been a speculation on her part. I have heard that they separated shortly before his father's death; but the affair was kept so much a family secret that nothing positive was ever heard about it."</p>
               <p>I listened in the dumb apathy that falls upon us with a crushing sorrow, and thought if I had told mamma of my acquaintance with him the sorrow might still have been mine, but the horrible, sudden shock would have been spared me. We are strange reasoners sometimes, even in the midst of despair.</p>
               <p>About twelve o'clock that night nurse roused me with the tidings that mamma had another hemorrhage. Dr. Stuart was sent for immediately, and devoted himself to her with the most unwearied care for the three dreadful days and nights in which her very life seemed hanging on a thread.</p>
               <p>When she began to amend, and the fear of losing her was lightened, my own sorrow began to press more heavily upon me. Dr. Stuart and nurse watched me anxiously, and, declaring that anxiety and close confinement had been too much for me, they excluded me as much as possible from mamma's apartments; and when thus excluded, I would wander about like a ghost, aimless and hopeless; or sit motionless in one place, seeing nothing and heeding nothing, enduring that dreariest of sorrow's many phases, dumb apathy and dull despair: or, again, melted to a sudden passion of tears, by the blithe trilling of some happy bird, or the faint breath of a flower as it came wafted in through the open casement, or the merry laugh of some happy child at play.</p>
               <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5979-00000065"/>
               <p>I never dared allow myself to think of Colonel De Vere. I put his memory steadily behind me, and strove to forget him. Alas! as if love ever can forget.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <p>ONE evening, about two weeks after mamma's attack, she called me to her side, and said,</p>
               <p>"Helen, has Dr. Stuart told you how I am?"</p>
               <p>"No, mamma; why? You are not worse, are you?" I asked, in quick alarm.</p>
               <p>"No worse, my child, but likewise no better; and Dr. Stuart says, I will never get any better here. My only chance for prolonged life is a speedy removal to Italy or the south of France."</p>
               <p>"Oh, mamma, is there nothing we can do? Did Dr. Stuart suggest no way?" I asked, vaguely.</p>
               <p>Mamma smiled a little, and said,</p>
               <p>"He certainly suggested a way, my darling; and I have less hesitation in mentioning it to you now than I would have had a month ago. Your face convinced me, the night of his return from Scotland, that you are not indifferent to Dr. Stuart; for if ever love's light and love's roses glowed in eyes and cheeks,<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5979-00000066"/> they did in yours that night. But as I may have been mistaken in regard to your feelings, I want you to understand from the first that your own feelings and wishes are alone to be consulted in the decision you make respecting the proposition that I am requested to lay before you. The few days or even years of life that may be left me, shall not be purchased at the expense of your happiness, my precious, unselfish child.</p>
               <p>"Dr. Stuart begged me to assure you of his unaltered love, and ask if you can consent to marry him. If you will, the marriage can take place at once, and he will carry us to Naples, or where you will, before the cold weather sets in. Should you marry him, my sole earthly care will be removed, and whenever I die my mind will be at rest about the future comfort of my precious child. If you love him, as I think you do, your happiness is beyond a fear; for he is worthy even of my peerless Helen. But if I am mistaken, and you had rather not become his wife, tell me so frankly, and if it be the will of the Lord, who doeth all things well, to spare me longer to you, then He will provide some other and better way; and in all things, His blessed will be done."</p>
               <p>I listened in dumb despair. Mamma's life was resting upon my words; and to save her I must consent to become the wife of one man when my whole heart and soul was filled with the image of another. At first I could not, would not, entertain the thought, it was too horrible and revolting; but as I rested my head against her knee, and felt the soft touch of her caressing fingers as she tenderly smoothed back the ringlets from my brow, a better spirit came over me. I remembered all the long years of her tender love and care, and that the dear life was so fast drawing to a close, and I might save her if I would; and I felt that my highest duty was to her, cost me what it might. I struggled long and bitterly with myself ere my mind was made up—one of those wild, inward conflicts that give no outward sign, but plough deep furrows in the soul. At length I raised my head and said steadily,</p>
               <p>"Mamma, tell Dr. Stuart I consent."</p>
               <p>And, stooping to kiss her pale cheek, I hastened to my own room, and locking myself in, I gave way to an agony of grief. Ah! those hours of fierce conflict, when "my bruise was incurable and my wound grievous!"</p>
               <p>In the twilight nurse came to my door and said,</p>
               <p>"Miss Helen, dear, Dr. Stuart wishes to see you, if you please."</p>
               <p>I felt like some hunted creature.</p>
               <p>As I entered the sitting-room Dr. Stuart came forward<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5979-00000067"/> ward to meet me. He was very much agitated, and strove in vain to steady his voice as he said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Tressylian has told me of her conversation with you, and I have come in person to plead my suit. I need not repeat the assurances of my love. You must know that my whole heart is unalterably yours. And if you will give me the dear right of caring for you, you shall never know another sorrow from which human love and forethought can shield you.</p>
               <p>"I had not meant to hurry your decision, but your mother's health requires such constant care; and, knowing your inflexible pride, I venture to plead for her sake, as well as my own happiness, that you will give me a son's right to share your devotion to her. Can you, will you give it to me?"</p>
               <p>He ceased speaking and waited my reply.</p>
               <p>I stood in voiceless agony, striving for strength to speak the words that would sacrifice my life to mamma. Life, did I say? Had it been only existence the decision would not have cost me one pang. After a pause, that seemed like an eternity to my wrung heart, Dr. Stuart said very gently,</p>
               <p>"Be merciful, Helen, and end my suspense, if it be only to deny me this dear little hand."</p>
               <p>The conflict was ended, I held out my hand, saying brokenly,</p>
               <p>"Take it, if you will, but 'tis all I have to give."</p>
               <p>His exceeding happiness touched me in spite of my selfish sorrow. He drew me down beside him on a sofa, and for once laid aside the modest reserve which was one of the characteristics of his manner. The flood-gates of his soul seemed uplifted, and as he revealed in such frank, manly words, the depth and intensity of his love for me, the thought that I was deceiving him and giving him only dry husks when he thought he was receiving fresh, rich fruit, overcame me. I would marry him, if needs be; but I would not deceive him by allowing him to believe that he had won my heart when I was giving him but unwillingly my hand; and slipping from beside him until I was kneeling at his feet, I exclaimed passionately,</p>
               <p>"I am unworthy of this love! I have none to give you in return! I feel nothing for you but affection and gratitude, not one spark of the love that a wife should have! I will disappoint and chill you; I can never make you happy; I will marry you if you wish it, but I will never deceive you by letting you think that I am giving you my heart as well as this wretched, worthless hand."</p>
               <p>And choked with convulsive sobs I hid my face in his bosom. I felt his strong heart beating thick and<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5979-00000068"/> fast beneath my cheek, and at last he said, very quietly, but with evident effort,</p>
               <p>"Helen, my dearest love! I do not understand this extreme emotion. Is it merely maidenly reluctance to assume new ties? or is there some deeper objection beneath it? You shall not marry me unless you really are willing to be my wife. If you have any objection to it, it is not too late to withdraw your consent: only tell me frankly, and everything shall be at an end between us; for though I love you with all my manhood's strength and ardor, my affection is not selfish. I do not wish you to marry me if it will cost you a single pang. Dearly as I love you—and I think no woman was ever more beloved—I would relinquish all claims upon you if there were any one whom you preferred to me."</p>
               <p>He paused a moment as if a new thought had occurred to him, and then added,</p>
               <p>"Tell me frankly, my darling; is there any one to whom, if my suit was withdrawn, you would more willingly give the hand I ask? I know you must have seen men who are far more qualified to win regard than I am."</p>
               <p>His nobility, his unexampled generosity, roused in me an answering spirit. I lifted my tear-stained face from his breast, and said earnestly,</p>
               <p>"You are the best, the noblest of men; there is no one but you whom I would marry. But bear with me a little while: it is all so strange and sudden."</p>
               <p>My voice failed in spite of me, and my tears flowed anew; but he comforted me with such loving sympathy, such unquestioning faith; he took me with such brave confidence, such generous trust, and I was so unworthy of it all!—even with his tender words sounding in my ears, my heart, heavy and grief-laden, was sickening with a vain longing to weep out its sorrows upon another breast. When at last he rose to seek mamma, he placed a ring upon the hand he was holding, saying, with smiling embarrassment,</p>
               <p>"I have worn this ring so long, hoping one day to be allowed to place it upon this precious little hand, and now, 'after so many days,' the dear wish is realized at last."</p>
               <p>"Are you happy?" I asked, wistfully.</p>
               <p>A deep flush came into his cheek, a lustrous flash kindled in his violet eyes, as he took me in his arms and said earnestly, passionately,</p>
               <p>"My darling, my happiness is perfect and satisfying."</p>
               <p>These words comforted me a little. If I could make mamma and Dr. Stuart happy, those two to whom I owed so much, it mattered little what I suffered<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5979-00000069"/> fered; and, married or single, I was equally lost to the only man with whom marriage could have been happiness to me. So, perhaps, it was better thus; but, oh! it was hard to think it then, when heart and soul alike shrank from the sacrifice.</p>
               <p>The ring Dr. Stuart put upon my hand was the diamond I had given to have sold for me long before, and which he had purchased himself and thus restored to me. His thoughtfulness touched me deeply, while the transaction in itself wounded my morbid pride.</p>
               <p>It was settled between mamma and Dr. Stuart that we should be married in three weeks, which would make our wedding fall upon his birthday, and, as he said, make the one date the anniversary of both the beginning and perfection of his life. I did not oppose it. Terribly soon as it seemed, I felt that whatever had to be done had best be done quickly, for I knew not how long my strained nerves could bear the stress.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I felt so sorry for Dr. Stuart. I knew how much he was deceived; for, despite my assurances to the contrary, he believed that I loved him, and when he discovered his mistake, as sooner or later he would certainly have to do, the disappointment would be so bitter. He would sit beside me in the twilight, and paint with such lingering, loving touches our future life: how happy we would be together: how we would go abroad and travel, and see the world that I had so wished to see: how the whole world should be taxed to minister to my pleasure: and how much happier and brighter life would be to him when he had a dear little wife to come home to when his day's work was done: all the things that fond lovers talk about and find happiness in anticipating; and I would listen silently, answering as pleasantly as I could when he appealed directly to me, but always with the refrain in my heart while he planned things that I had wished to do,</p>
               <p>"Dust and ashes! wishes realized only when their fulfillment will bring an added pain! Apples of Sodom, fair and beautiful to behold, but dust and ashes in your grasp!"</p>
               <p>He was very anxious about me. I could see that in his tender watchfulness and loving patience with all my variations of temper and feeling. I believe, although he never even remotely hinted such a thing to me, that he thought my mind affected. He knew that there was hereditary insanity in my family, and to what else could he attribute my nervous prostration and wasting depression? The disease always took the form of melancholy with us; and how could<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5979-00000070"/> he dream that it was a real sorrow which had laid its heavy hand upon me?</p>
               <p>Sometimes his unvarying tenderness soothed and comforted me, for I loved him as if he had been my only brother, with a deep, quiet affection which was more hopelessly removed from love than even active dislike would have been; and then at other times his mere presence chafed me almost beyond endurance, and it was only by the exercise of the most rigid self-control that I could manage to endure it. Sometimes he would see this and instantly to my wish; and then I would be so sorry for him, for I knew how much I must be disappointed him, though he never even hinted it to me.</p>
               <p>For myself, I let things drift, striving to think neither of the past nor the future, but to absorb myself wholly in the present. My success, however, was but indifferent. I was wasting away to a shadow. I could neither eat nor sleep; or, if I did fall into a troubled slumber, it was only to be tortured with dreams that were worse than consciousness. Nurse watched me sorrowfully, and tried with all her skill to tempt my fickle appetite; and when I would turn with loathing from the food she brought me, which I always tasted to please her, she would shake her head and turn dejectedly away. At last, entering my room very suddenly one day, and finding me in tears, her anxious affection could bear silence no longer, and she asked me that was the matter? I neither could nor would inform her, and she exclaimed, sorrowfully,</p>
               <p>"Child! child! you are killing yourself. You can't hide your misery from the eyes that love you. I see you wasting day by day, with all your pretty color fading, and your sweet, playful ways laid aside. You don't eat enough to keep a midge alive, and, come to your door when I will at night, I see your lamp burning and hear your light step across the floor, back and forth, back and forth, as long as I stand there. You have some trouble on your mind, my bonny bairn. Oh! tell your old nurse what it is."</p>
               <p>I leaned against her and cried as if my heart would break; but to all her entreaties I had but one reply to make,</p>
               <p>"Oh! nurse, I have nothing to tell."</p>
               <p>She left me at last, sorrowfully incredulous; and then, by her very tenderness and compassion she made my self-control harder to maintain. Sympathy unnerved me. I only wanted to be let alone.</p>
               <p>I look back upon those days, now, with a feeling of absolute wonder that I survived them. The sky seemed brass, the a earth iron, everything was a<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5979-00000071"/> mockery, everything an utter weariness. Life, death, love, religion, everything bored me. I never penned a line or read a page. I could not form a prayer with either heart or lips; I knelt down from habit, and as my lips moved to form the familiar words, a mocking, inward voice would whisper,</p>
               <p>"What is the use? you don't mean what you say: and if you did, there is no power that can or will save you. God does not pity you, or He would have saved you from this woe. Will He perform a miracle, and move heaven and earth to undo His own work? why pray?"</p>
               <p>And then I would rise; and in those days such were my devotions.</p>
               <p>But God did pity, and when I had endured the furnace-fires, "At eventide there was light."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <p>I HAD never ventured to leave the cottage, fearing to meet Colonel De Vere, but as days merged into weeks without my hearing anything of him, I presumed he had gone abroad again; and one evening, just a week before my wedding-day, sick of the house wherein I had suffered so much, and wearying to be entirely alone and freed from the loving scrutiny of the eyes that kept continual watch upon me, I walked down upon the sands. The spot I had determined to revisit had been a favorite resort of mine from its loneliness, and a sick fancy to see it again had haunted me for several days.</p>
               <p>The evening was gloomy and threatening, and a searching wind blew fitfully from the coast. A dull, leaden sky stretched across from sea to hill, unvaried by a single cloud, save at the water's edge, where a lurid, purple line broke up its gray monotony. A barren waste of sand lay white and desolate around,<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5979-00000072"/> strewed with shells and seaweed; and high overhead rang out, ever and anon, the sea-fowl's melancholy cry. Close by the moaning surf, and washed at morn and eve by the restless tide, rose up, stern and gray, a mass of craggy rocks. Here I had often sat and dreamed such dreams as would never again tint my ashen life with their roseate and golden splendor. And here, lonely and desolate as the scene I had chosen, I sat down and gazed with hopeless agony in the face of my despair. While I thus mused a quick, impatient footstep crushed the sands at my feet, and, as I looked up, dizzy with heart-beats, two eager hands grasped my own, two glowing eyes gazed upon me with unutterable love, and Colonel De Vere's rich, harp-like voice called me by name. I sprang to my feet, exclaiming wildly,</p>
               <p>"Why, oh why, have you come back?"</p>
               <p>"Because I was dying away from you. I could bear it no longer," he answered passionately.</p>
               <p>"Then I must leave you. Release my hands instantly, and let me go."</p>
               <p>"Helen, my darling," he said softly, without heeding my request,—"Why do you treat me so hardly? Do you know how long I have been watching and waiting to see you? longing with unutterable desire just to be near you, to touch your hand, or even the hem of your dress, just to be conscious of your dear presence; and now that we are together why poison the joy with such cruel coldness? I cannot harm you: I would not if I could. Then why shrink from me as if I was some deadly thing? Can you not trust me for the few moments that we will be together?"</p>
               <p>I felt my wild love surging over heart and soul at the music of his voice, and, bracing myself with a strong effort of will, I said resolutely,</p>
               <p>"It is not a question of trust, Colonel De Vere, it is one of simple honor; I must not stay with you, because you have a living wife, and I am betrothed to another man. Respect his rights, if you do not regard my wishes, and at once release my hands."</p>
               <p>He gazed upon me with a look of blank surprise and horror as he exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Betrothed! Oh, Helen! you surely cannot mean it! Tell me that it was a jest, a dream, anything but the truth! Unsay those cruel words, for oh! Helen, I cannot bear it."</p>
               <p>His eyes, filled with appealing anguish, sought my face as he spoke. I turned away, unable to witness his sorrow, as I answered steadily,</p>
               <p>"I cannot unsay the truth; I am engaged; but my marriage can raise no greater barrier between us than already exists in your own."</p>
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5979-00000073"/>
               <p>He bent his face down upon my hands that he still held, and exclaimed, in a voice wrung with agony,</p>
               <p>"Oh God! oh God!"</p>
               <p>How instinctively that cry rises to our lips when a sudden storm of sorrow beats us down, and, blindly conscious of our weakness, we appeal to an Almighty Power for strength. The first unreasoning impulse makes us reach out through "the darkness that may be felt" for a guiding Hand, crying out for succor to the One only who can give us strength to bear the blow.</p>
               <p>But Colonel De Vere was not a man to yield without a bitter struggle, even to the inevitable; and soon recovering his self-possession, he began eagerly to beat down my resolution, heaping argument upon argument against my marrying, and finally capping the whole with the statement that I did not love Dr. Stuart.</p>
               <p>"No," I said firmly, "I do not love him as such a noble man deserves to be loved, but I shall none the less marry him."</p>
               <p>"Helen," he cried desperately, "you know not what you are doing. There are no fetters on earth so galling as those that bind you in a loveless marriage. I know it in all its bitterness, and, although I am a man, and consequently had far less to bear in married life than you will, I can tell you from my own experience there is no worse fate to be encountered. Believe me, you will regret such a step more and more each day of your life. Let me teach you through my dearly-bought knowledge, and do not condemn yourself wilfully to such hopeless misery."</p>
               <p>"Is it kind, is it generous," I said, interrupting him passionately, "for you to paint the picture in darker colors than it must needs wear to my own imagination? If I must needs suffer martyrdom, should yours be the breath to blow the flames up brighter? Strengthen me for the sacrifice, instead of striving to weaken my resolve."</p>
               <p>"But, my darling," he answered softly, "I do not see any necessity for your sacrificing yourself. As you say, an impassable barrier already interposes between us. Why should you add anything to it? You will not quench your love for me by marrying another. You will not forget that I love you one day the sooner because you are Dr. Stuart's wife. Why then subject yourself to the added pain of marrying?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot afford to remain single," I cried bitterly. "My marriage is simply a question of shillings and pence. I marry because thus only can I command the means of prolonging the life of my beloved and helpless mother."</p>
               <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5979-00000074"/>
               <p>"And so you mean to speculate upon your personal charms, to sell yourself for so many pounds <foreign xml:lang="LAT">per annum!</foreign> Truly, the ambition is a lofty one, though not quite what one would have expected in a daughter of the Tressylians," he said, with bitter sarcasm.</p>
               <p>I saw through the bitterness down to the despairing love which prompted it, and answered calmly,</p>
               <p>"One day perhaps you will regret the insult you have offered me, and the injustice you have done me by that cruel speech. For myself, I see my own duty too clearly to be turned from it either by your persuasions or taunts, though the latter might well have been spared me."</p>
               <p>He flushed crimson with shame as he answered impulsively,</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, oh forgive that cowardly, unmanly speech! I do not believe it, I did not mean it when I spoke, but I am mad, wild, reckless, at the thought of your belonging to any other man. I shall not suffer it: this wrong to us both shall not be done: I have ample wealth; let me supply the funds for which you are willing to sacrifice so much."</p>
               <p>My cheek flushed proudly as I coldly replied,</p>
               <p>"You forget yourself, and everything else, when you venture to make any such proposition. Of all men you are the last from whom I either could or would receive pecuniary aid. Let us end the discussion: it only inflicts useless pain upon us both."</p>
               <p>A moment of silence elapsed, and then he said, bending both head and knee before me, and speaking hurriedly and as if half afraid,</p>
               <p>"Then, Helen, hear me yet again. Let me marry you. Give me of all men the sole right to care for you. You know how wildly I adore, I worship you."</p>
               <p>"This is worst of all. You seem to forget that you are a married man when you dare to insult me with such a proposition," I said passionately, my face flaming with hot anger as I spoke.</p>
               <p>"Nay, Helen, flush not so deeply. I did not mean to insult you: how could I? Nor did I forget. But hear me out. I did not tell you quite all of my miserable history. Any ecclesiastical court would release me from that union. Let me sue for a divorce."</p>
               <p>"It would only be useless pain and exposure for you. I could never marry a divorced man. The Bible and every instinct of my own nature forbid it. Death is the only divorce that I hold valid. There is nothing that can be done in this case but what I have resolved upon. Let us part now. I cannot bear this conflict any longer. I have suffered so much of late."</p>
               <p>The fierce light faded out of his eyes as he gazed upon me and said softly,</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5979-00000075"/>
               <p>"It is because I would save you from future pain and grief, my darling, that I urge you to remain unwedded. You will add a thousandfold to every pang you now endure if you marry without love. In pity to me, if not to yourself, dissolve this engagement. I cannot endure to think of you as any man's wife. You are mine, and mine only. Oh! Helen, I love you, I cannot give you up."</p>
               <p>I made no answer. Worn out with the struggle, I could only hide my face and weep until it seemed as if my very life was flowing out in the tears. He sat beside me striving to comfort me as he only could, but ever and anon the tide of his rebellious love broke over his lips in a wild spray of words, and he strove with passionate eagerness to make me yield.</p>
               <p>At length, stung by my silent resistance, he said bitterly,</p>
               <p>"Helen, I do not believe that you ever loved me. If you had you could not sacrifice me to a mere scruple of your own unreasonable pride."</p>
               <p>This injustice wrung from me an avowal that all his tender pleading had failed to elicit, and I exclaimed passionately,</p>
               <p>"I have lavished all the worship of my soul upon you: I have made you my idol, and bowed down before you and worshipped you, and a jealous God has smitten me for it. I dare not resist Him: I am but a broken reed, a writhing worm in His grasp. Let me be guided by my own conscience in this woful crisis. Pity the weakness which makes it worse than death to resist your wishes, and because I love you, be generous and give me up."</p>
               <p>"Give you up! My darling! do you think I could, after what I have just heard? Never! You are mine, and mine only, and neither man nor angel, Heaven nor Hell, shall come between us. Little child, I love you."</p>
               <p>He lifted my drooping head and gazed full into my eyes as he uttered the last words in a tone of such intense feeling as defies description.</p>
               <p>The splendor of his appearance at that moment I can never forget. A rich flush glowed on his bronzed cheek, and his dark eyes were full of the superb light of love and triumph. His whole face was radiant; he looked as the conqueror of a hard-fought field might look when his adversary laid down his sword. His superb eyes dazzled me, and as my cheek crimsoned beneath his gaze, he laughed a low, sweet laugh of conscious power, and bending suddenly down kissed me full upon the month. The pressure of his lips recalled me with a pang of shame to myself. No man save Dr. Stuart had a right to caress me thus,<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5979-00000076"/> and struggling to escape his arms I exclaimed remorsefully,</p>
               <p>"Oh! how wrong, how sinful, how dishonorable this all is. I am betraying a noble man's trust. I am false to my own plighted word. I have promised to marry him, a I will, cost what it may. Oh! Edward, strengthen me, pity me; but as you are a man, do not tempt me to wilful dishonor."</p>
               <p>The day was dying, and as I spoke the incoming tide washed up to the sands at my feet, and I said, rising as I spoke,</p>
               <p>"Come, let us go; the tide is coming in."</p>
               <p>He rose and stood beside me, looking at the foam-capped waves as they retreated, and then throwing both arms around me he drew me to his breast, saying passionately,</p>
               <p>"Helen, let us die here, clasped thus in each other's arms. If we live, 'tis only to be cruelly parted. If we die, we will be together for all time."</p>
               <p>I rested my face upon his bosom, and the temptation seemed irresistible. The thought of my nearly approaching marriage; the wild strife in my own heart; the loathing and repulsion which must deepen with each day of my new life; contrasted with the rest and oblivion of death, dying for his sake, in his arms, with no old or new ties to come between us. I was weak and shattered by suffering, and I stood unresisting in his strong clasp, with his warm kisses showered upon lips and cheeks, and felt with such perfect rest and comfort that the struggle was ended.</p>
               <p>The tide flowed in once more, higher than before, and as its cold waters broke over us my involuntary shudder made him hold me but the closer, as he whispered fondly,</p>
               <p>"A few minutes longer, and the worst will be over, my brave, true-hearted darling."</p>
               <p>And I listened as one in a dream, peaceful, fearless, and happy. And just then, clear over the sands rang out the evening chimes, and their first peal brought back to me with an agony of self-reproach the memory of my mother.</p>
               <p>"Mamma! oh mamma!" I cried. "Edward, my life is hers, not mine: I must live for her sake, for I am all she has."</p>
               <p>But he only smiled dreamily upon me, and kissed me again and again.</p>
               <p>Every moment we delayed, the thought of her helplessness and dependence upon me for everything, even life itself, her devoted love for me, and the wild sorrow that would wring her heart should I be taken so suddenly and cruelly from her, became more intolerable. My selfishness assumed a monstrous, hideous<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5979-00000077"/> form, and I said, counterfeiting a fear I did not feel, but well knowing that a thought of me was all that would influence him,</p>
               <p>"Oh! Edward, save me! if you love me, save me from the horror of this death."</p>
               <p>He started as if from a dream, and gathering me in his arms sprang with wonderful strength and agility up the cliffs and far above the reach of the rising tide.</p>
               <p>Thoroughly humbled, and repentant for my suicidal sin, as soon as I could speak I said earnestly,</p>
               <p>"Let us part now: no good will result from a longer interview. But ere you go, with the horror of our late sin strong upon me, promise me that you will never again attempt to shorten the term of life-servitude that God has appointed you. We have sins enough to answer for without adding blood-guiltiness to them."</p>
               <p>He would not answer this, and urged by love and fear I pleaded with him until the pledge was given, and then I said sorrowfully,</p>
               <p>"Now let us say farewell, and part."</p>
               <p>He took my outstretched hand, but not to say farewell: only to kneel before me and passionately implore me not to marry, using every weapon in his argument that jealous love and frantic despair could forge. Had my hair been any color but chestnut-brown, that day's wild warfare would have bleached it like the sands on which I stood. Why should I re-paint that despairing scene, whose agonizing details are branded as by fire on my brain? 'Tis enough that I can say that, though tempted within and without, wrung by grief, and loving him as man is but rarely loved, I yet had strength to keep my faith unbroken.</p>
               <p>But, oh! Almighty Lord! that conquest cost me dear.</p>
               <p>At last even he saw the uselessness of strife, and yielded in despair; and, as he bent over my hand, I felt his hot tears fall fast upon it.</p>
               <p>Into that hour I concentrated all the agony of years. I suffered until I lost the power to feel, and heard without comprehension his wild despair and passionate farewell. I dimly remember, nerved by a strength not my own, breaking from him at length and reeling, "drunken, but not with wine," over what seemed like endless space, until I reached home, and then, amidst a confusion of lights and voices, a sudden blank fell upon me, and I lost everything in a merciful insensibility.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>When I recovered consciousness Dr. Stuart was kneeling<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5979-00000078"/> ing beside, me with the fingers on my wrist. I heard him tell mamma that he was at a loss to account for the extreme duration of the attack. It was clearly the result of strong nervous excitement: had I been unusually excited during the day? Neither mamma nor nurse could reply satisfactorily to the question, and I was too much exhausted to talk. Every movement brought on a return of the faintness.</p>
               <p>Dr. Stuart sat by me several hours, and finding that I was rallying under treatment, he administered a powerful nervous sedative, and advised that I should be left alone; and they all retired and left me to live over again and again the crowded agonies of the day, hearing Colonel De Vere's voice in all its thrilling music of pleading and reproach, and feeling his tears still raining on my hands, until memory became one long vibration of agony.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <p>FOR two days I was ill, but on the third I insisted upon leaving my room. Dr Stuart gently remonstrated against it, but I felt if I gave up then that it would be impossible for me ever to fulfil my engagement with him; and I meant to save mamma's life, come to me afterwards what might.</p>
               <p>She watched me anxiously all the while, but she had no reason to suspect me of anything but an overtaxed <foreign xml:lang="FRA">physique,</foreign> and often said that Italy and rest would soon restore me to myself. I never left the house. I dared not risk another meeting with Colonel De Vere, who, I knew, was haunting my vicinity.</p>
               <p>One night, very late, I was standing by my window looking out; for, late in the season as it was, I was compelled to keep my casement open, as I was consumed with inward fever. Sleeplessness had become one of the minor shades in the sombreness of my condition, and I not unfrequently spent whole nights<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5979-00000079"/> at my window, watching wearily for the slow-coming dawn. And while I thus stood a dark shadow fell upon the sward! My heart leaped suddenly up, and then stood perfectly still, as the faint moonlight revealed the pale, worn face of Colonel De Vere. That moment was the crisis of my life. I felt that if I listened to a single word I would yield all he could ask; one vibration of his tender voice would break down all my strongholds; and wringing my hands with a wild, despairing gesture, I closed the window before his eyes; and then, extinguishing my lamp, I fell upon my knees beside my couch and was kneeling there when the gray dawn crept in. Not that I had been praying; for in all those weary hours but one sentence passed my lips: "And he took Simeon and bound him before their eyes."</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>And thus, with loitering agony, the days dragged slowly past.</p>
               <p>The eve before my bridal, nurse came into my room and said, "I do not mean to pry into your affairs, Miss Helen, since you will not trust me; but this morning, just after dawn, a gentleman called me into the shrubbery, and begged me to give you this letter the first moment I could see you alone. I said no at first; for, Miss Helen, you know it doesn't look just right to have secrets with strangers. But when he asked me again, with such sorrow in his face and voice, I could not find it in my heart to refuse. I ask you no questions about him, but if he is a lover I misdoubt if you knew your own mind when you said him nay. Whatever you do, my dear young lady, don't marry without love. 'Tis not too late to change your mind. If you are in trouble let me help you: you know there is naught I would not do for my own bonny bairn, who laid in my breast and comforted my sore heart when God took my own little lamb to His arms."</p>
               <p>"If you had strangled me when I lay within your arms you could have helped me. Now it is too late," I said, bitterly, as I took the letter from her hand.</p>
               <p>It was from Colonel De Vere, and I could see how much he had suffered in the unsteadiness of his usually bold, graceful chirography. I did not break the seal. I dared not trust my fainting heart to read the words penned by his dear hand. And so I wrote upon the cover,</p>
               <p>"I will be married to-morrow morning. It is useless for you to write or me to read. God help us both, if He can."</p>
               <p>And, re-sealing it in another envelope, I handed it to<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5979-00000080"/> nurse and asked her to return it. She looked searchingly at me and said,</p>
               <p>"Is this all you will let me do for you, Miss Helen?"</p>
               <p>"It is all you can do, nurse," I answered, as I turned my face away. She stood irresolute a moment, and then said,</p>
               <p>"Miss Helen, may I tell you a story about your own people?"</p>
               <p>"Not now, dear nurse; some other time, please," I said, wearily.</p>
               <p>"Some other time will be too late, my precious lamb. Let me tell it now."</p>
               <p>"As you please then, nurse," I said; and she thus began:</p>
               <p>"'Twas in the reign of the blessed Martyr, Miss Helen, when the kingdom was rent with division, family arrayed against family, and house against house. Your people, of course, took sides, as they always did, with the king; but their near neighbors, the Lords of Mortmaine, went with the Parliament. Lord Maurice de Mortmaine had long been a suitor of the Lady Adelicia Tressylian, but she did not favor him; and, in the political troubles that followed, the families, being supporters of rival factions, held no farther intercourse with each other.</p>
               <p>"It happened in one of the battles that the old Lord Hugo Tressylian, Lady Adelicia's father, and his nephew, Sir Rupert, her own true love, both fell into the hands of the rebels, and, as they had been very zealous in the king's behalf, they were condemned to die.</p>
               <p>"Lord Maurice de Mortmaine was a general in the rebel army, and high in power then, and in his hands these captive lords were held. 'Twas late at night when the news of their capture reached Tressylian Hall, and the rain was pouring down like a flood. There was not a gentleman of the family at home; from the gray-haired grandsire to the beardless stripling, all were bearing arms for the king. When the tidings reached the Hall, Lady Adelicia ordered her palfrey and an attendant, and, mounting, she rode in hot haste to Mortmaine Close, where the rebel general held his headquarters. The gates were locked, and when, in answer to their summons, the sentinel asked who they were, the lady said,</p>
               <p>"'Tell Lord Maurice de Mortmaine that the Lady Adelicia Tressylian stands at his gates and prays speech with him.'</p>
               <p>"In a few moments the general came out, and himself led the palfrey into the court-yard, and, lifting the lady down, carried her into the hall, for the storm was raging wildly all the time. As soon as she stood upon the pavement, she fell at<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5979-00000081"/> his feet, and besought the lives of those so dear to her.</p>
               <p>"Twas a strange sight to see—a Tressylian a suppliant. Lord Maurice heard her out, and then coldly said,</p>
               <p>"'I can save those lives, but if I do, it must be on my own terms. I love you, as you know. If you will marry me I will save them; if not, they die at sunrise.'</p>
               <p>"Lady Adelicia knew the man—his inflexible selfishness, and cruel heart. She would plead no more, but, rising to her feet, proud and resolute as a Tressylian should be, she said,</p>
               <p>"'You know that I do not love you, and that I have always loved another—that I would not give my cousin Rupert's glove for your whole body; but if you will spare the lives I came through wind and storm to save, on no terms but those you offer me, I will marry you. Set them at liberty, give them safe conduct to the coast of France; and when a trusty messenger, who shall be my own priest, brings me a sure token of their safety, the hour he returns, seek me at Tressylian Hall, and I will then marry you.'</p>
               <p>"'And what surety have I that Lady Adelicia will keep faith with the lover she abhors?' he asked.</p>
               <p>"'If the word of a Tressylian, never yet pledged in vain, does not suffice, my Lord de Mortmaine, there lies my glove. I will redeem my word whenever you lay it before me,' and she drew off her tiny gauntlet and threw it at his feet.</p>
               <p>"The general sat down and wrote what she demanded; and gave it to an officer to be executed; and then he begged her to remain and rest until morning. But she refused to sleep beneath his roof, and, declining the escort he urged upon her, mounted her palfrey and returned as she had come.</p>
               <p>"In due time the clergyman returned, and brought her letters from her friends, who had reached the coast of France in safety.</p>
               <p>"Lord de Mortmaine came with the priest to Tressylian Hall, and when she had read her letters, he knelt before her and held up her little glove.</p>
               <p>"'I am ready, my lord,' she said haughtily.</p>
               <p>"They were standing in the great hall, Miss Helen, in the western court. The two officers of the rebel army who had accompanied the general, were called in as witnesses, and in a few minutes she had been made his wife.</p>
               <p>"When the ceremony was over, Lady Adelicia said,</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5979-00000082"/>
               <p>"'My Lord de Mortmaine, have I kept faith with you?'</p>
               <p>"'Right nobly, lovely lady,' he said, advancing to her.</p>
               <p>"But she waved him back, saying,</p>
               <p>"'Give me one moment's liberty:' and as she spoke, she plunged a dagger swiftly in her breast, and exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"'And thus I keep faith with Rupert,' she fell dead in their midst.</p>
               <p>"Lord de Mortmaine rushed out of the hall, and was slaughtered in the next battle; and 'tis said, when his body was examined, that the little glove of Lady Adelicia was found lying on his breast."</p>
               <p>I listened quietly to the story, which I had heard before, and when it was ended I said, calmly,</p>
               <p>"You need not fear my killing myself, nurse, with either dagger or bowl; you will return the letter to its owner, and mamma and I will go to Italy. So you see there is to be no dying in the question."</p>
               <p>Nurse looked at me in sorrowful surprise, and said wistfully,</p>
               <p>"Are you quite sure you are doing right, dear Miss Helen? To-morrow will be too late."</p>
               <p>"I am quite sure, nurse; please go," I answered steadily.</p>
               <p>She turned and slowly left the room, and I felt as if, in each step she took, she was treading on my heart.</p>
               <p>I do not understand how I lived through those days. Perhaps Dr. Stuart's fear was partially true, and I was not mentally quite myself, but I was unconscious of the warp, if one existed. Indeed, I had no distinct consciousness of anything but dull, hopeless pain.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <p>MY wedding-day dawned cold and cheerless; a dull, gray fog clouded the landscape, and a sharp, searching wind blew fitfully from the sea.</p>
               <p>We were to be married very early in the morning, at the church, with no witnesses except Dr. Stuart's lawyer and the nurse.</p>
               <p>Mamma had hoped to go with me, but the day was too inclement for her to venture out; and so I went forth uncheered by her dear presence, to take upon myself new ties and duties, and lay aside forever the dreams of my girlhood's life.</p>
               <p>Dr. Stuart met me at the church-gate, and, leaning on his arm, I entered the door.</p>
               <p>The Rector, in his snowy robes, was standing in the chancel, and immediately commenced the ceremony. I listened vaguely to his words, mechanically making the responses, and only fully realizing what it all meant, when his deep voice said,</p>
               <p>"I pronounce you man and wife."</p>
               <p>Then a wild terror rushed over me, a frantic desire to flee away to the very ends of the earth. And then Dr. Stuart's kiss was pressed upon my cheek, and his tender voice claimed me as his wife.</p>
               <p>As we turned from the chancel, and irresistible impulse to look up came over me. I raised my eyes to the organ-loft, and saw, sharply outlined against its crimson drapery, a white, stern face, locked and rigid with agony, and a pair of blazing eyes, filled with unutterable reproach, fixed full upon me.</p>
               <p>That look of agony! Oh God! it haunted me for years.</p>
               <p>I gazed upon him like a serpent-charmed bird, and then the face, stern and reproachful to the last, seemed to recede an immeasurable distance from me. A horror of great darkness, sudden, intense, and awful, fell upon me; and without word or sound, I sank down unconscious at Dr. Stuart's feet.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
               <p>TEN years have rolled into the gulf of vanished time since that terrible day, and the woman who pens these lines has but little in common with the one who was then treading alone the winepress of such fiery affliction.</p>
               <p>A long illness followed my inauspicious wedding—a brain-fever so severe that for weeks my life was scarcely hoped for, as it was feared that my reason would certainly be lost. Everything to me was a chaotic ruin. Days, nights, and weeks, mingled into one, in the horrible phantasmagoria that represented existence for those many days, when the waters of affliction prevailed over the face of my earth, and the frail ark in which I was lodged tossed to and fro with the violence of the waves; and when the fever abated there followed long, weary months of slow convalescene, when I seemed to stand still, getting neither better nor worse, a weak, helpless invalid. I was not fighting with disease alone, but with a crushing sorrow which defied all my efforts to subdue, and at times even to control its bitterness.</p>
               <p>My beloved mother died three years after my marriage, and her death opened anew the flood-gates of sorrow; for, in all the tide of human woe, tears for a lost mother leave the deepest channels on the sands of life.</p>
               <p>What my husband was to me in those dark days no words of mine can tell. Always so kind and tender; never impatient of my ceaseless tears and wasting grief; but ever loving, and striving to comfort the wife who was drenching his life with the salt spray of her woes. And when some word or tone, or some rush of memory, recalled another and a lost love to my mind, the tears that sprang unbidden from their fount were wept out upon his faithful bosom, or wiped away by his most tender hand. The rarest forbearance, the most self-sacrificing generosity, found their incarnation in that peerless man. And as years wore on, and the sands of time drifted thicker over the deep grave in my heart, won at length by his untiring devotion, I began to lay aside my selfish sorrow, and to receive with something more than passive endurance, the ceaseless tokens of his love.</p>
               <p>At last I came to love him truly and tenderly; not<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5979-00000085"/> as I could love, not as I had loved, but with a depth and sincerity that I strove not to conceal. The days were brighter when he spent them all at my side, and I missed him with the keenest sense of loneliness when he was away. And for his dear sake I put all the past away from me, and strove to recall some of my olden brightness, to make sunshine in his home. But, like nearly all repentance, mine came too late to be of much avail. When I awoke to a sense of my error and would amend it, the hour had passed; my span of time had reached its outer limit.</p>
               <p>My <foreign xml:lang="FRA">physique,</foreign> naturally frail, and with a hereditary taint of consumption in it, had been so severely taxed by unaccustomed privation and sorrows that it suddenly gave way. A mainspring had broken somewhere, and the whole physical mechanism began swiftly to run down.</p>
               <p>My husband exhausted skill and science in the vain hope of arresting that disease which, if once fairly developed, completely baffles cure. His eye, usually so quick to detect the infliction of a vital blow, closed resolutely against the sight of the sign-manual of death upon my cheek. He would not see the rose from the garden of Azrael that bloomed so brightly there, or believe that my weakness and lassitude resulted from aught but a necessity for a change of air. And so we became perfect birds of passage, forever on the wing; for, as soon as we had spent a few weeks at any place, Dr. Stuart, failing to perceive the expected improvement in my condition, would not believe that the fault lay in me, but would straightway charge it upon the climate, and then become impatient to take me somewhere else.</p>
               <p>I never opposed these constant hegiras. If it was any comfort to him to employ every possible remedial agent, I was only too anxious that he should enjoy it while he could; well knowing that the hopelessness of my case will become evident all too soon for him.</p>
               <p>I feel so sorry for him, when I see how devotedly he clings to the faded remnant of my life, and I know how fast it is slipping from his grasp; for I fell that my days, perhaps even my hours, are all numbered. I stretched out my hand to-day, and my wedding-ring slipped from the finger that has grown all too small to keep it on; and as dear, faithful nurse handed it back to me, I saw her turn her head aside to wipe away her tears.</p>
               <p>Were it not for the sake of my dear husband and herself, I would not grieve at laying down the life whose fetters have proved so heavy. For the one great object of my life has been realized at last—<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5979-00000086"/> the safety of the soul once so inexpressibly dear to me, seems to have been granted to my ceaseless prayers.</p>
               <p>A few months ago, while we were in the south of France, a begging friar made his way into my room, where by some rare chance I had been left alone, and asked of me a small donation to his order. There was something familiar about the man that appealed to me strongly, and I gave him what he asked. After he had received it he knelt beside me and silently presented me with a small and exquisitely carved ivory crucifix. I refused, at first, to accept it, but he seemed so eager that I should that I said,</p>
               <p>"I will take the cross, if you wish it so much, but you must accept from me in return an offering for your Lady's shrine. What shall I give you?"</p>
               <p>"If <foreign xml:lang="FRA">madame</foreign> will give me the plainest ring upon her hand, it will be a most acceptable gift to my patron," he said, with evident eagerness.</p>
               <p>I drew off a ring holding a large, exquisite pearl, and gave it to him. As he rose he hid it in the folds of his robe, and said earnestly,</p>
               <p>"Press the crucifix to your lips, madame, if only once, for the sake of one poor soul."</p>
               <p>I smiled at the superstition, but promised what he asked. He turned to go, and as he reached the door he paused and said rapidly, in an entirely different tone from the one he had used before,</p>
               <p>"Senhora, I have followed you six months to find this moment. God preserve you for the sake of the lonely life that is wasting all its strength in vain regrets! I will tell him all that has passed."</p>
               <p>'Twas Piedro, Colonel De Vere's Spanish servant; and ere I could recover from the agitation of the memories his presence recalled he had gone. I held the cross still clasped in my hands unnoticed for some time. When I remembered it, the pressure of my clasp has unfastened a spring at the back, and a little door opened, and revealed inscribed, in tiny but familiar characters, these words and initials:</p>
               <p>"I have found the Lord. E. De V."</p>
               <p>That moment appeared to be all for which my strength had been reserved, for I have failed steadily ever since.</p>
               <p>I do not fear to die. 'Tis only for the sake of those to whom my life seems to be so dear that I would live. For myself, I am ready to lay down the burthen of this mortality whenever the Master wills, and await, in the hope of a joyful resurrection and reunion, the appointed time of Him, who, through the fiery furnace of affliction, snatched me, "as a brand plucked<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5979-00000087"/> from the burning," from the sin of idolatry, and led me, chastened, humble, and repentant, to His feet. Even so, O Lord! in Thine own way, Thy righteous will be done.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <p>THE manuscript of Mrs. Stuart terminates very abruptly. Whether she had written all that she intended can never now be known. He husband, entering her room one day, found her fainting at her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">escritoire,</foreign> and after that attack her malady increased with fearful rapidity, and in a few weeks terminated her existence.</p>
               <p>The closing scenes were peaceful and serene. She retained her consciousness to the last, and gently fell asleep in Jesus, with her head resting upon her husband's breast.</p>
               <p>At her express wish she was buried at Exham, near the church; and in an incredibly short time, long before the order sent to Italy by Dr. Stuart could be filled, a superb shaft of the finest Carrara marble was placed over her grave. The inscription upon it was touching in its extreme simplicity—only her name and age, followed by the words,</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5979-00000088"/>
               <p>"My soul followeth hard after thee."</p>
               <p>Whose hand had erected this monument of love was never known, for the workmen were all foreigners, and sworn to secrecy. But the conjecture that it was Colonel De Vere is probable enough to wear the air of certainty.</p>
               <p>Dr. Stuart returned to Exham, and, after some time, resumed his charitable ministrations among the poor and wretched. Nurse Becky, of course, lived with him until the close of her faithful life.</p>
               <p>The only allusion he ever made to the revelations contained in Mrs. Stuart's memoirs, was to an intimate brother practitioner, who had been complimenting him on his unerring skill in diagnosis, to which he replied, sadly,</p>
               <p>"You very much over-estimate my abilities in what you term my specialty. I am often almost a criminal blunderer. I once treated a case for mental aberration when the true malady was a breaking heart, and, ere I discovered my error, I had gone too far to save the patient."</p>

               <p>AT the close of a dull November day, in the marble halls of a Venetian palace, a man, worn by the storms of forty-nine years, lay dying.</p>
               <p>Through the pale lips the faint breath came slow and labored; across the broad brow were the footprints of sorrow; and mingling with the rich mass of dark hair was many a silver thread, that told its own story of hours of silent agony.</p>
               <p>Wasted by grief, and rudely shaken by tempestuous sorrow, the sands of life had nearly run out, and the vital flame burnt low and dim. For hours he had lain thus, silent and motionless, doing battle alone with the last adversary with whom he should ever cross swords.</p>
               <p>Across the dreary waters of the Adriatic sea the vesper-bells pealed clear and soft. At their first chime, a change came over the worn face of the sufferer, a color crept into his pale cheeks, a light<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5979-00000089"/> of sudden joy blazed in his dark eyes, and, stretching out his arms with a strength which seemed to come from an unknown source, he exclaimed, in a voice whose failing music thrilled with the rapture of a realized hope,</p>
               <p>"Oh, Father! I thank thee! Helen, my darling, mine own at last."</p>
               <p>And then the silence and shadow of death fell over him; and the tide of life and love was suddenly merged in the waters of that wide sea whose waves lap the dim shores of the great Hereafter.</p>
               <p>And who will deny that there met him on that farther side, her whom in life he had loved so tenderly, and in death had lamented so faithfully? Surely the All-Father, in His tender compassion for His children, will gather up these fragmentary, insufficient lives, and for the cross He has laid upon them here, He will give them a crown of rejoicing in His everlasting Kingdom, where their long sorrow will be turned into joy, eternal in the Heavens, and that fadeth not away.</p>
               <p>In the quiet little church at Exham, in sound of the restless, moaning sea, there soon was made another solitary tomb; and in it the self exiled lord of Seaforth Court lay sleeping quietly at last.<q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"His palms were folded on his breast—</l>
                        <l>There was no other thing expressed,</l>
                        <l>But long disquiet merged in rest."</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And over this tomb, when the clear twilight is lying like a soft veil over the face of day, there often bends a lonely, smitten man, who, as he reads the name, with its sounding titles and long descent, can find in his noble heart no root of bitterness against the memory of the rival whose faults he covers and whose blessings he sums up in the generous words and thought,</p>
