               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>PARSON Wibird Hawkins was in trouble. The trouble was not of a
                  pecuniary nature, for the good man had not only laid up treasures in heaven, but
                  had kept a temporal eye on the fluctuations of real estate in Rivermouth, and was
                  the owner of three or four of the nicest houses in Hollyhock Row. Nor was his
                  trouble of a domestic nature, whatever it once might have been, for Mrs. Wibird
                  Hawkins was dead this quarter of a century. Nor was it of the kind that sometimes
                  befalls too susceptible shepherds, for the parson had reached an age when the
                  prettiest of his flock might have frisked about him without stirring a pulse.</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5557-00000007"/>
               <p>His trouble was the trouble of all men who, having played their parts nearly if
                  not quite to the end, persist in remaining on the stage to the exclusion of more
                  fiery young actors who have their pieces to speak and their graces to show off.
                  These hapless old men do not perceive that the scene has been changed meanwhile,
                  that twenty or thirty or forty years are supposed to have elapsed; it never occurs
                  to them that they are not the most presentable poets, lunatics, and lovers, until
                  the audience rises up and hoots them, gray hairs and all, from the
                  foot-lights.</p>
               <p>Parson Wibird Hawkins had been prattling innocently to half-averted ears for many
                  a summer and winter. The parish, as a parish, had become tired of old man Hawkins.
                  After fifty years he had begun to pall on them. For fifty years he had christened
                  them and married them and buried them, and held out to them the slightest possible
                  hopes of salvation, in accordance with their own grim theology; and now they
                  wanted to get rid of him, and he never once suspected it,—never suspected it,
                  until that day when the deacons waited upon him in his study in the cobwebbed old
                  parsonage, and suggested the expediency of his retirement from active parochial
                  duties. Even then he did not take in the full import of the deacons'
                  communication. Retire from the Lord's vineyard just when his experience was ripest
                  and his heart fullest of his Master's work,—surely they did not mean that! Here he
                  was in his prime, as it were; only seventy-nine last Thanksgiving. He had come
                  among them a young man fresh from the University on the Charles, he had given them
                  the enthusiasm of his youth and the wisdom of his mature manhood, and he would,
                  God willing, continue to labor with them to the end. He would die in the harness.
                  It was his prayer that when the Spirit of the Lord came to take him away, it might
                  find him preaching His word from the pulpit of the Old Brick Church.</p>
               <p>"It was very good of you, Deacon Wendell, and you, Deacon Twombly," said the poor
                  old parson, wiping the perspiration from his brow with a large red silk
                  handkerchief dotted with yellow moons; "it was, I must say, very considerate<pb
                     n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5557-00000008"/> siderate in you to think that I might
                  wish to rest awhile after all these years of labor; but I cannot entertain the
                  idea for a moment."</p>
               <p>He had got it into his head that the deacons were proposing a vacation to him,
                  were possibly intending to send him to Europe on a tour through Palestine, as the
                  Saint Ann's parish had sent the Rev. Josiah Jones the year before.</p>
               <p>"Not," he went on, "but I should like to visit the Holy Land and behold with my
                  own eyes the places made sacred by the footsteps of our Saviour,—Jerusalem, and
                  Jordan, and the Mount of Olives,—ah! I used to dream of that; but my duties held
                  me here then, and now I cannot bring myself to desert, even temporarily, the flock
                  I have tended so long. Why, I know them all by face and name, and love them all,
                  down to the latest ewe-lamb."</p>
               <p>The latest ewe-lamb, by the way, was Deacon Twombly's, and the allusion made him
                  feel very uncomfortable indeed. He glanced uneasily at Deacon Wendell, and Deacon
                  Wendell glanced covertly at him, and they both wished that the duty of dismissing
                  Parson Hawkins had fallen upon somebody else. But the duty was to be performed.
                  The matter had been settled, and the new minister all but decided on, before the
                  deacons went up to the parsonage that afternoon. Even before the king was cold,
                  his subjects had in a manner thrown up their caps for the next in succession. All
                  this had not been brought about, however, without a struggle.</p>
               <p>Some of the less progressive members of the parish clung to the ancient order of
                  things. Parson Wibird had been their main-stay in life, sickness, and death for
                  full half a century; they had spring to manhood and grown gray under his
                  ministrations, and they held it a shame to throw him over now that his voice was a
                  little tremulous and his manner not quite so vigorous as it was. They acknowledged
                  he was not the man he used to be. He wrote no new sermons now; he was turning the
                  barrel upside-down, and his latest essay dated back as far as 1850. They admitted
                  it was something of a slip he made, in resurrecting one of those by-gone sermons,
                  to allude to General Jackson as "our lately deceased President<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000009"/> dent"; but then the sermon was a good sermon,
                  enough sight better than those sugary discourses without a word of sound doctrine
                  in 'em, which they had listened to from flibberty-jibberty young ministers from
                  the city. There was one, of them the other day,—the Sabbath Parson Hawkins was
                  ill,—who preached all about somebody named Darwin. Who was Darwin? Darwin was n't
                  one of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>"Fur my part," said Mr. Wiggins, the butcher, "I'll be shot ef I don't stan' by
                  the parson. He buried my Merriah Jane fur me, an' I don't forgit it nuther."</p>
               <p>As it was notorious that the late Maria Jane had led Mr. Wiggins something of a
                  dance in this life, the unconscious sarcasm of his gratitude caused ill-natured
                  people to smile.</p>
               <p>Uncle Jedd, the sexton of the Old Brick Church threatened never to dig another
                  grave if they turned off Parson Wibird. Uncle Jedd had a loose idea that such a
                  course on his part would make it rather embarrassing for Rivermouth folks. "Ther'
                  is graves an' ther' is holes," Uncle Jedd would say; "I makes graves, myself, an'
                  I'm th' only man in th' county thet can."</p>
               <p>Unfortunately the parson's supporters constituted the minority, and not an
                  influential minority. The voice of the parish was for the dismissal of the Rev.
                  Wibird Hawkins, and dismissed he should be.</p>
               <p>Deacons Wendell and Twombly found their mission perplexing. "We tried to let him
                  down easy, of course," remarked Deacon Zeb Twombly, relating the circumstance
                  afterwards to a group of eager listeners in Odiorne's grocery-store; "but, Lord
                  bless you, you never see an old gentleman so unwillin' and so hard to be let
                  down." The, parson persisted in not understanding the drift of the deacons'
                  proposition until, at last, they were forced to use the most explicit language,
                  and in no way soften the blow which they suspected rather than knew would be a
                  heavy one, however adroitly delivered. But when, finally, he was made to
                  comprehend the astounding fact that the Old Brick Church of Rivermouth actually
                  wished him to relinquish his pastorate, then the aged clergyman bowed his head,
                  and, waving<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5557-00000010"/> ing his hands in a sort of
                  benediction over the two deacons, retreated slowly, with his chin on his breast,
                  into a little room adjoining the study, leaving the pillars of the church standing
                  rather awkwardly in the middle of the apartment.</p>

               <head type="sub">A PARSON OF THE OLD SCHOOL.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>EVER since the death of his wife, some twenty-five years previous to
                  the events I am relating, Parson Hawkins had lived in the small house at the foot
                  of Horseshoe Lane. The house stood in the middle of a garden under the shadow of
                  two towering elms, and was so covered by a network of vines, honeysuckle and
                  Virginia creeper, that the oddities of its architecture were not distinctly
                  visible from the street. Though the cottage was not built by the parson, its
                  interior arrangements were as eccentric and inconvenient as if he had designed it.
                  It consisted of three or four one-story Ls which had apparently been added to the
                  main building at various periods, according to the whim or exigency of the
                  occupant. At the right of the hall, which paused abruptly and went up stairs, so
                  to speak, was the parson's<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5557-00000011"/> son's study;
                  opening from this was a smaller chamber, the sanctum sanctorum, lined to the
                  ceiling with theological works; and beyond this again, though not communicating
                  with it, was the room where the parson slept. At the left of the hall was the
                  parlor, redolent of mahogany furniture and the branches of pungent spruce which
                  choked the wide chimney-place summer and winter, for the parlor was seldom used.
                  Then came the dining-room, and next to that the kitchen. Leading from the former
                  were two sleeping-chambers, one occupied by Salome Pinder, the parson's
                  housekeeper. The second story of the main building had been left unfinished on the
                  inside. Viewed from the garden gate, the zigzag roofs, touched here and there with
                  patches of purple and gold moss, presented the appearance of a collection of
                  military cocked-hats.</p>
               <p>It was altogether a grotesque, ruinous, tumbledown place, and people wondered why
                  Parson Hawkins should have given up his stately house on Pleasant Street and moved
                  to Horseshoe Lane, and why he remained there. But Salome Pinder understood it.</p>
               <p>"The parson, you see," said Salome, "is gittin' a leetle near in his old age. He
                  'pears to git nearer an' nearer ev'ry year. When Miss Hawkins was alive, why,
                  bless you! there was n't nothin' too handsum nor expensive for her, an' I won't
                  say she was over an' above grateful, for she was n't; but she's dead, the poor
                  creeter, an' the best of us lack more 'n wings to be angils. The day after the
                  funeral the parson says, 'S'lome,' says he, 'we'll move into the cottage, it's
                  quite good enough for me.' 'Nothin''s too good for you, Parson Wibird,' says I.
                  But he didn't feel content in the great house, an' it was sort o' lonely; so move
                  we did, to the disapp'intment of some,—I don't mention no names,—who thought that
                  mebbe the parson would invite 'em up to Pleasant Street permanent. P'rhaps the
                  Widder Mugridge was the most disapp'inted. But, Lord love you, the parson ain't
                  one of them that is always runnin' after wimmin folks. He 's ben married
                  onst."</p>
               <p>That was very true, and that Parson Hawkins's matrimonial venture was not
                  altogether of an encouraging complexion seems likely;<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000012"/> for he declined to repeat the experiment. For
                  several years after the translation of Mrs. Hawkins, the parish supposed he would
                  take another helpmeet, and, in fact, more than one seductive cap had been sedately
                  set for him; but the parson had shown himself strangely obtuse. He was not an old
                  man at that time, but he loved quiet, and perhaps his life had not been too
                  tranquil under Mrs. Hawkins's reign. Besides, as Salome said, the parson was
                  becoming a little near, not in a general way, but in his personal expenses. The
                  poor knew how broad and practical his charity was. His closeness manifested itself
                  only in matters pertaining to his own comfort. He seemed to regard himself as an
                  unworthy and designing person, who was obtaining food and clothes under false
                  pretences from Parson Hawkins.</p>
               <p>These economical tendencies had flowered out occasionally in his wife's time, but
                  had been promptly taken up by the roots. Whenever his coat showed signs of wear or
                  his hat became a trifle dilapidated, Mrs. Hawkins had made him buy a new one. It
                  was whispered in and out of the parish that once, when the parson protested
                  against replenishing his wardrobe, Mrs. Hawkins, who appears to have been a person
                  of considerable executive ability, settled the question by putting the parson's
                  best waistcoat on the kitchen fire. I do not vouch for the truth of the story,
                  for, though nothing occurs in Rivermouth without being known, a great many things
                  are known there that never occur at all.</p>
               <p>This may have been one of them; but it is certain that after Parson Hawkins took
                  up his abode in the small house he neglected himself frightfully. His linen was
                  always scrupulously neat and fresh, for Salome saw to that; but he wore his coats
                  until the seams stood out pathetically, like the bones of the late Mr. Jamison,
                  the Living Skeleton, who used to travel with Van Amburgh's circus, and must have
                  given Death very little trouble to make a ghost of him. Of course Salome could not
                  put the old gentleman's coats into the kitchen stove when they became shabby. The
                  parson's thriftiness increased with his years, and no doubt sorely cramped Salome,
                  who had a New England housewife's appreciation of bountiful<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000013"/> living, and to whom a riotous number of mince-pies
                  was a necessity at Thanksgiving. She uttered no complaint, however, and was quick
                  to resent any reflection on her master's domestic parsimony.</p>
               <p>"We could live on the fat of the land if we wanted to," said Salome to Mrs.
                  Waldron, who had dropped in of an afternoon to gossip. "The parson he's a rich man
                  as time goes, an' the pore oughter be thankful for it. He feeds the widder an' the
                  fatherless, instead of a-stuffin' hisself."</p>
               <p>"I wanter know now!"</p>
               <p>Salome's homely statement was strictly accurate. However severe the internal
                  economy at the small house in Horseshoe Lane, the poor were not scrimped. The
                  Widow Pepperell had her winter fuel regularly; and the two Clemmer boys, whose
                  father had leaned against a circular saw in the Miantonomoh Mills, knew precisely
                  where their winter jackets were coming from. Even wayside tramps—there were no
                  professional mendicants in Rivermouth—halted instinctively at the modest white
                  gate, Doubtless the parson helped many a transparent ent impostor on his winding
                  way. There was a certain yellow dog that used to walk lame up to the scullery door
                  for a bone, and then run away with it very nimbly on four legs. Sandy Marden's
                  Skye-terrier was likely enough, only a fair type of many that shared the parson's
                  bounty.</p>
               <p>He had been a prosperous man. When he first came to Rivermouth he purchased a lot
                  of land at the west end of the town, as a pasture for a horse which he neglected
                  or forgot to buy. The "minister's pasture" became a standing joke. It turned out a
                  very excellent joke in the end. Several times he was tempted to sell the land for
                  less than he gave for it; but it had cost him little, and he thought that perhaps
                  it might be worth something more by and by; so he held on to it. As the town grew,
                  fashion drifted in that direction. Then Captain Pendexter put up his haughty
                  Gothic mansion at the head of Anchor Street. That settled the business. A colony
                  of French-roof houses sprang up as if by magic along Josselyn Avenue, and the
                  "minister's pasture" was about as valuable a piece of property as<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000014"/> there was in Rivermouth. So it came to pass that
                  Parson Hawkins was a moderately rich man. The people thought the parson was pretty
                  shrewd, when perhaps he was only pretty lucky: if he had been shrewd he would have
                  sold the land long before it was worth anything. Another speculation he entered
                  into at this time was not so successful. If the local tradition is correct,
                  Colonel Trueworthy Dennett's daughter Dorcas got the best of that bargain.</p>
               <p>But for many years now the parson's lines had fallen in pleasant places. The
                  tumult and jar of life never reached him among his books in the seven-by-nine
                  library in Horseshoe Lane. The fateful waves of time and chance that beat about
                  the world surged and broke far away from the little garden with its bright row of
                  sentinel hollyhocks and its annual encampments of marigolds and nasturtiums. To be
                  sure he had had, four or five years before this chronicle opens, what he regarded
                  as a grievous affliction. The parish, contrary to his wishes, had removed the old
                  pine-wood pulpit and replaced it with an ornate new-fangled black-walnut affair
                  thick wit grotesque carvings like a heathen idol. The old pulpit was allowed by a
                  hundred associations; it had been built in King George's time; eminent had divines
                  whose names are fresh in our colonial history had stood under that antiquated
                  sounding-board; but, after all, what did it matter to him whether he expounded the
                  Scriptures permitted to teach his children the way and the life? His annoyance was
                  but transient and he came to look upon it as a vanity and vexation of spirit on
                  his part. But now a real trouble had come to him.</p>
               <p>While the two deacons were engaged with the parson in the study that May
                  afternoon, Salome Pinder moved about the hall and the dining-room with strange
                  restlessness. Few things went on in the cottage without her cognizance. Not that
                  Salome was given to eavesdropping; but the rooms were contracted, the partitions
                  thin, and words spoken in even the usual conversational tone had a trick of
                  repeating themselves in the adjacent apartments. The study door was ajar, and
                  Salome could<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5557-00000015"/> scarcely help catching
                  scraps of the dialogue from time to time.</p>
               <p>Long before the deacons took their departure she knew very well what had happened.
                  In fact, when she saw Deacon Twombly and Deacon Wendell coming up the garden walk,
                  she felt their visit to be ominous. Salome knew of the dissatisfaction that had
                  been brewing in the parish for months past. That Parson Hawkins never dreamed of
                  it shows how unfitted he was to serve longer. The appearance of the executioners,
                  with warrant and bow-string, was the first intimation he had of his downfall.</p>
               <p>Salome was appalled by what had taken place, though in a degree prepared for it.
                  She was so flustered that she neglected to open the front door for the retreating
                  deacons, but left them, as the parson had done, to find their way out as best they
                  might.</p>
               <p>It was some time before she could gather strength to cross the hall and look into
                  the study. The parson was not there; he was in the little inner room, and the door
                  was locked. Salome tried the latch and spoke to him several eral times without
                  getting a reply. Then the parson told her gently to go away, he was engaged, he
                  would talk with her presently. But Salome did not go away; she sunk into a chair
                  and sat there with her hands folded listlessly in her lap,—a more abject figure,
                  perhaps, than the old parson on the other side of the door.</p>
               <p>The scent of the lilacs blew in at the open window, and the leaves of the vines
                  trailing over the casement outside made wavering silhouettes on the uncarpeted
                  floor of the study. The robins sang full-throated in the garden, as if there were
                  no such thing in the world as care. Salome listened, and wondered vaguely at their
                  merriment.</p>
               <p>The afternoon sunlight slipped from the eaves and the shadows deepened under the
                  great elms. The phantom leaves at Salome's feet had vanished; the songs of the
                  robins had died away to faint and intermittent twitterings, and the early twilight
                  crept into the study. Now and then she fancied she heard the parson moving in the
                  little room; he seemed to be walking to and fro at intervals,<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000016"/> like some poor caged animal. She could not
                  tell.</p>
               <p>It was nearly dark when the garden gate swung to with a sharp click, and a quick,
                  light footstep sounded on the gravel-walk. Salome rose hastily from the chair, and
                  reached the street-door just as some one stepped upon the porch.</p>
               <p>It was a girl of nineteen or twenty, but looking younger with her hair blown about
                  her brows by the fresh May wind. She held in one hand a chip-straw hat which had
                  slipped from its place, and with the other was pushing back an enviable mass of
                  brown hair, showing a serious, pale face, a little flushed at the cheeks with
                  walking. It was a face which, passing it heedlessly in the street, you would be
                  likely to retain in your memory unconsciously. The wide gray eyes, capable of
                  great tenderness and great haughtiness, would come back to you vividly, maybe,
                  years afterwards. The girl was not a beauty in the ordinary sense, but she had
                  what some one has described as a haunting face. Who has not caught a chance
                  expression on some face in a crowd,— a lifting ing of the eye, a turn of the lip,
                  an instantaneous revelation of strength or weakness,—and never forgotten it? I
                  have a fancy, which I do not thrust upon the reader, that the person who casts
                  this spell on us would exert a marked influence over our destiny if circumstance
                  brought us in contact wit him or her. He or she would be our good angel or our
                  evil star.</p>
               <p>As the girl stood there now on the porch she looked little enough like playing the
                  part of a Fate. With her heavy hair blown in clouds over her eyes, she looked
                  rather like a Shetland pony.</p>
               <p>"O Miss Prue! is that you, honey?" cried Salome. "Do jest step in an' speak to the
                  parson; he's in a peck of trouble."</p>
               <p>"I was afraid so, Salome. Where is he?" asked the girl, pushing open the door of
                  the study and seeing it unoccupied.</p>
               <p>"He's locked hisself in the sanctrum," whispered Salome.</p>
               <p>"Locked himself in?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, an' there he's ben ever sence them plaguey deacons went away, more 'n two
                  hours."</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5557-00000017"/>
               <p>"Maybe he will not care to see me just now, Salome?"</p>
               <p>"Mebbe,—dunno; but do jest speak a word to him."</p>
               <p>"If you think I had better?"</p>
               <p>"I do, honey."</p>
               <p>"How strange,—to lock himself in!"</p>
               <p>Then Prudence Palfrey crossed the study, and tapped softly on the panel of the
                  inner door.</p>

               <p>Among those who had been instrumental in removing Parson Hawkins from the
                  pastorate of the Brick Church was Mr. Ralph Dent, a retired brewer of considerable
                  wealth and much local influence. He was not, as a general thing, deeply concerned
                  in parish affairs; he contributed liberally to every worthy charitable project,
                  and was always to be seen in his pew at the morning service; but it was of
                  comparatively small moment to him whether the parson's discourse was long or
                  short, brilliant or dull, for he invariably went to sleep. Mr.<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000018"/> Dent, for reasons which will appear, did not admire
                  Parson Hawkins warmly; but if Mr. Dent had loved him he would have gone to sleep
                  all the same. There are men who cannot, to save themselves from perdition, keep
                  awake in sermon-time.</p>
               <p>So Mr. Dent had no objection to Parson Hawkins as a parson; but he was aware that
                  many in the parish had rather strong objections. The congregation embraced a large
                  number of young people, chiefly women, who always like their minister sleek and
                  interesting, and they were not content with what had satisfied their grandparents.
                  The old pastor was visibly breaking up, and a new man was wanted. Now it chanced
                  that Mr. Dent, in one of his periodical visits to New York, had made the
                  acquaintance of a Mr. James Dillingham, a young gentleman of fortune and
                  aristocratic Southern connections, who was travelling in the North for his health.
                  Mr. Dillingham had been educated for the ministry, but, owing to ill-health, and
                  perhaps to his passion for travel, had never been settled permanently over a
                  society. A quick friendship sprung up between the two men, despite the disparity
                  of their years, for Mr. Dillingham was not more than twenty-eight, and Mr. Dent
                  was well on in the second half of that ridiculously brief term allotted to
                  moderns. In the course of various conversations, Mr. Dillingham became interested
                  in Rivermouth, and thought that perhaps he would visit the lovely New England
                  seaport before returning South. He would certainly do so, if he undertook his
                  proposed pilgrimage to Quebec. But the Canadian tour, and even his return South,
                  were involved in considerable uncertainty. The bombardment of Fort Sumter by the
                  South-Carolinians had brought matters to a crisis; war was inevitable. Mr.
                  Dillingham's property was largely invested in Western and Northern securities,
                  fortunately for him; for, though he was Southern born and bred, he had no sympathy
                  with the disunionists of his native State. In the mean time it might be necessary
                  for him to make the North his home.</p>
               <p>It flashed on Mr. Dent that here was the very man for the Old Brick Church. Young,
                  wealthy, in good social position, and of unusually<pb n="32-33"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000019"/> ally winning address, he would be a notable
                  acquisition to Rivermouth society. He broached the subject indirectly to his
                  friend, who was not at first disposed to discuss it as a possibility; then Mr.
                  Dent urged the matter warmly, and had nearly carried his point, when he was
                  obliged to go back to Rivermouth.</p>
               <p>At Rivermouth he laid the case before the deacons; they opened a correspondence
                  with Mr. Dillingham, which resulted in his agreement to preach for them on the
                  last Sunday in May following. "Then," he wrote, "we shall be in a position to
                  decide on the best course, should the vacancy occur to which you allude in your
                  letter." This was satisfactory. Mr. Dillingham was not to be drawn into an
                  inconsiderate engagement. But then Mr. Dillingham was rich, and not like those
                  poor, drowning clergymen, dragged down by large families, ready to clutch at such
                  frail straws of salary as Rivermouth could hold out. Upon this it was decided to
                  relieve Parson Hawkins of his charge, and take the chances of securing Mr.
                  Dillingham.</p>
               <p>Throughout the matter Mr. Dent had acted on impulse, as the most practical man
                  sometimes will, and had been in no way swayed by personal animosity towards Parson
                  Hawkins, for he felt none. But when all was said and done, a misgiving shot across
                  him. What would Prue say? She all but worshipped the old parson. Mr. Dent himself,
                  as I have more than intimated, did not worship the parson. There had been an
                  occasion, a painful passage in Prue's life, when it seemed to Mr. Dent that Parson
                  Hawkins had stood between him and the girl. All that was past and nearly forgotten
                  now; but the time had been when he thought the minister was alienating Prue's
                  affections from him.</p>
               <p>Prudence Palfrey was Mr. Dent's ward. His guardianship had a certain tinge of
                  romance to it, though perhaps no man was less romantic than Mr. Dent. He was a
                  straightforward, practical man, naturally amiable and accidentally peppery, who
                  had had his living to make, and had made it by making beer. A romantic brewer
                  would be an anomaly. There is something essentially prosaic in vats and barrels;
                  but this did not restrain Mr. Dent in early life<pb n="34-35"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000020"/> from falling in love with Mercy Gardner,—for
                  brewers are human, though they may not be poetical,—nor is it likely that the
                  brewery, which was then a flourishing establishment, had anything to do with her
                  refusal to marry him. She married his book-keeper, Edward Palfrey, and went to the
                  Bermudas, where Palfrey had obtained a clerkship in an English house. There, after
                  five years, he fell a victim to an epidemic, and the widow, with her
                  three-year-old girl, drifted back to Rivermouth. Dent bore a constant mind, and
                  would probably have married his old love; but Mrs. Palfrey died suddenly, leaving
                  Prudence and what small property there was to his charge.</p>
               <p>He had been faithful to the trust, and had had his reward. The pretty ways and
                  laughter of the child had been pleasant in his lonely home, for he never married.
                  Then the straight, slim girl, looking at him with Mercy Gardner's eyes and
                  speaking to him with Mercy Gardner's voice, had nearly consoled him for all; and
                  now the bloom of her womanhood filled his house with subtile light and beauty. In
                  all his plans Prue's interest was the end. Whatever tenderness there was in his
                  nature turned itself towards her. For her sake he acquired a knowledge of books,
                  and became an insatiable reader, as men always do who take to books late in life.
                  He sold out the brewery, not so much because he was tired of it as that he did not
                  want the townspeople to be able to say that Prudence Palfrey was only the brewer's
                  girl. When she was of age to go into society, the best houses in town were open to
                  Mr. Dent and his ward,—the Goldstones', the Blydenburghs', and the Grimses',—which
                  might not have been the case if the old brewery had not faded into the dim and
                  blessed past.</p>
               <p>It must be understood that there are circles in Rivermouth into which a brewer in
                  the present tense could no more penetrate than a particularly fat camel could go
                  through the eye of a remarkably fine cambric-needle,—charmed circles, where the
                  atmosphere is so rarefied that after you have got into it the best thing you can
                  do, perhaps, is to get out of it again. It is not well to analyze the thing
                  closely. It is all a mystery. One is pained to find that<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000021"/> the most exclusive people have frequently passed
                  their early manhood in selling tape or West India groceries in homœopathic
                  quantities. This is not an immoral thing in itself, but it is certainly illogical
                  in these people to be so intolerant of those less fortunate folks who have not yet
                  disposed of their stock. However, this is much too vast and gloomy a subject for
                  my narrow canvas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent was proud of social position for Prue's sake. There was no girl like her
                  in Rockingham County. When he bought Willowbrook, a spacious house with grounds
                  and outbuildings, a mile from the town, she sat at the head of his table like a
                  lady as she was, for she had honest New England blood in her veins. That Prudence
                  was as dear to him as if she had been his own daughter, he fully believed; but how
                  completely she had curled about his heart, like a vine, he did not discover until
                  his nephew, John Dent, fell in love with her and all but married her out of hand.
                  This must also be told while, Prue's kept waiting at the parson's study door.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>WHEN Prudence was turning seventeen,—that is to say, nearly three
                  years before that afternoon in May when she is introduced to the reader,—John Dent
                  had come to Rivermouth. He had recently graduated, with not too many honors, and
                  was taking a breathing-spell previous to setting out on his adventures in the
                  world; for he had his dragons to overcome and his spurs to win, like any young
                  knight in a legend. Poverty and Inexperience, among the rest, are very formidable
                  dragons. They slay more young men every year than are ever heard of. The stripling
                  knight, with his valise neatly packed, by the tearful baroness, his mother,
                  sallies forth in a spick-and-span new armor from the paternal castle,—and, snap!
                  that is the last of him. Now and then one comes back with gold-pieces and
                     decorations<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5557-00000022"/> orations, but, ah! for the
                  numbers that go down before the walls of great towns like New York and Boston and
                  Chicago!</p>
               <p>John Dent's family had formerly lived in Rivermouth, where he had lost his mother
                  in infancy. At this time his father was associated in the proprietorship of the
                  brewery, from which he subsequently withdrew to engage in some Western railroad
                  enterprise. When Mr. Benjamin Dent moved to Illinois, John was a mere child; he
                  had not been in Rivermouth since; his vacations had been passed with his father,
                  and he had only the vaguest memory of his childhood's home. It was a cherished
                  memory, nevertheless; for an unwavering affection for the place of one's nativity
                  seems to be one of the conditions of birth in New England. It was during John
                  Dent's last term in college that his father had died, leaving his railroad affairs
                  hopelessly complicated. Though communication between the two brothers had been
                  infrequent of late years, the warmest feeling had existed on both sides, and Mr.
                  Ralph Dent was eager with purse and advice to assist his nephew in any business or
                  profession he might select.</p>
               <p>John Dent was quite undecided what to do with himself. When some outlying personal
                  debts were paid off there would be enough left to keep him afloat a year. Within
                  that year of course he must have his plans definitely settled. He had come to
                  Rivermouth to talk over those plans with his uncle, and a room had been provided
                  for him at Willowbrook.</p>
               <p>"Look here, Prue," Mr. Dent had said, laughingly, the day his nephew was expected,
                  "I won't have you making eyes at him."</p>
               <p>"But I will, though!" Prudence had cried, glancing back over her shoulder, "if he
                  is anything like his uncle."</p>
               <p>But John Dent did not resemble his uncle, and Prue did not make eyes at him. She
                  found him very agreeable, nevertheless, a tall, frank-hearted young fellow with
                  dark hair and alert black eyes,—in every way different from the abstracted young
                  student her fancy had taken the liberty to paint for her. He smoked his uncle's
                  cabañas as if he had been born to them, and amused Prue vastly with descriptions
                  of his college life and with the funny little profiles of his college chums which
                     he<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5557-00000023"/> drew on blotting-paper in the
                  library. If he could have been examined in caricature, or allowed to graduate from
                  the gymnasium, he would not have come off so poorly for honors.</p>
               <p>Prudence had rather dreaded the advent of the gloomy scholastic, and had been
                  rather curious about him also. They had played together at a period when Prue was
                  learning to walk and John Dent wore pinafores. They had not met since then. It was
                  odd for her old playfellow to be an utter stranger to her now. What sort of man
                  was that little boy whom she had lost so long ago in the misty fairyland of
                  babyhood? A solemn young man in black, she had fancied. She had pictured him
                  prowling about the house and lawn, brooding like the young Prince of Denmark, not
                  on psychological subtleties indeed, but on sordid questions as to how on earth he
                  was going to get his living. How he was going to get his living did not seem to
                  trouble John Dent in the least.</p>
               <p>Reading one of Thackeray's novels in a hammock on the piazza, or strolling in the
                  garden after supper, with his cigar glowing here and there among the shrubbery
                  like a panther's eye, he did not appear much appalled by prospective struggles for
                  existence. The Dents were always that way, Mr. Ralph Dent remarked; free and easy,
                  with lots of latent energy. Put a Dent in a desert, and he would directly build
                  some kind of a manufactory. A brewery likely enough.</p>
               <p>And indeed there was something under John Dent's careless manner which seemed to
                  give the assurance that when the time arrived he would overthrow the wicked giants
                  and slay the enchanted dragons with neatness and despatch, like a brave modern
                  knight in an English walking-coat and a mauve silk neckerchief drawn through an
                  amethyst ring. Uncle Ralph thought here was a good deal to the boy,—and so did
                  Prue.</p>
               <p>He was superior to any young man she had ever seen. She had seen few, to be sure,
                  for Rivermouth is a sterile spot in which to pick up a sustenance, and her young
                  male eagles generally fly from the nest as soon as they are fledged, some seaward
                  and others to the neighboring inland cities. They are mostly sickly<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000024"/> eagles that are left. So Prudence had encountered
                  few young men in her time, and those she had not liked; but she did like John
                  Dent.</p>
               <p>John Dent had come to Rivermouth bearing about his person some concealed wounds
                  inflicted by the eldest daughter of his Greek professor; he had, in fact, been
                  "stabbed with a white wench's black eye, shot through the ear with a love-song,"
                  as Mercutio phrases it; but before ten days were gone at Willowbrook these wounds
                  had somehow healed over, leaving scarcely a cicatrice on his memory.</p>
               <p>Given a country-house, with a lawn and a pine grove, and two young people with
                  nothing in the world to do,—let the season be springtime or winter,—and it
                  requires no wizard to tell the result. Prue, with her genuine fresh nature and
                  trim figure and rich hair and gray eyes, was easy to like, and very much easier to
                  love. I am not trying to find reasons for these young people. If people who pair
                  were obliged to have good reasons for pairing, there would be a falling off in the
                  census.</p>
               <p>It came to pass, then, at the end of four weeks, that John Dent found himself
                  thinking night and day of his uncle's ward. He knew it was a hopeless thing from
                  the start. He was twenty-three, penniless, and without a profession. Nothing was
                  less tenable than the idea that his uncle would permit Prudence to engage herself
                  to a man who might not be in a position these five years to give her a home. Then
                  as to Prudence herself, he had no grounds for assuming that she cared for him. She
                  had been very frank and pleasant, as was permissible to the nephew of her
                  guardian; her conduct had been from the beginning without a shadow of coquetry.
                  She had made no eyes at him.</p>
               <p>Prudence would not have been a woman and eighteen if she had not seen somewhat how
                  matters were going with the young gentleman. She did not love him, as yet; but she
                  liked him more than any one she had ever known. She knew as well as he that
                  anything beyond friendship between them would be unfortunate. She determined to
                  afford him no opportunity to speak to her of love, if he were so unwise. She would
                  keep him at such a distance as would render it difficult for him to indulge in<pb
                     n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5557-00000025"/> the slightest sentiment with her. Prue
                  had passed to her eighteenth birthday without so much as a flirtation; but she at
                  once set to work managing John Dent with the cool skill of a seaside belle in her
                  second season. It is so a young duck takes to water.</p>
               <p>There were no moonlight walks on the lawn any more; but it fell out so naturally
                  that John Dent saw no diplomacy in it. Household duties, which she could have no
                  hand in conjuring, rose up between them and the pine grove. People from the town,
                  very stupid people, dropped into the drawing-room of an evening, or his uncle
                  failed to drop out. When they were alone together, and frequently when Mr. Dent
                  was present, Prudence would rally the young man about the professor's daughter
                  whom he had mentioned incidentally early in his visit. She suspected a tenderness
                  in that direction, and in handling the subject developed powers of sarcasm quite
                  surprising to herself. She was full of liveliness those days.</p>
               <p>John Dent was not lively now; he was gradually merging into that saturnine and
                  melancholy-eyed student whom Prue had so dreaded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ralph Dent was struck by this phenomenon. It seemed to him latterly that his
                  ward laughed too much and his nephew not enough. It had been the other way. Mr.
                  Dent was, as I have said, a practical man, except in this, that he expected other
                  people to be practical. He did not dream that his nephew would have the audacity
                  to fall in love with Prue. But the change that had come over the two gave Mr. Dent
                  a twinge of uneasiness. Perhaps he had not been wholly wise in having John Dent at
                  Willowbrook.</p>
               <p>The more he reflected on Prue's high spirits and his nephew's sudden low ones, the
                  less he admired it. If there had been any nonsense between them, he would put a
                  stop to it before it went any further.</p>
               <p>Running through the Willowbrook grounds was a winding rivulet spanned by a rustic
                  bridge, at the farther end of which, under a clump of willows, stood a
                  summer-house,—an octagon-shaped piece of lattice-work with four gilt balls
                  suspended from a little blue spire on the roof: a Yankee's idea of a pagoda. Here
                  John Dent was thoughtfully smoking a cigar<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5557-00000026"
                  /> one morning when he saw his uncle cross the birch-bark bridge and come towards
                  him. Mr. Dent stepped into the summer-house, seated himself opposite the young
                  man, took out his cigar-case, and went directly to the business in hand.</p>
               <p>"Jack," said Mr. Dent, "I hope you have n't been talking any nonsense to
                  Prue."</p>
               <p>"I don't think I understand you," said Jack, with a little start. "I have n't, to
                  my knowledge, been talking any nonsense to her."</p>
               <p>"For the last week or so you have not seemed like yourself, and I fancied that
                  perhaps something had happened between you and Prue,—a little tiff maybe."</p>
               <p>"Nothing in the world, sir."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent, like Hamlet, wanted something "more relative than this."</p>
               <p>"You are sure you have not been making love to her, Jack?"</p>
               <p>"I have certainly not been making love to Miss Palfrey, if that is what you
                  mean."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent drew a breath of relief. If his nephew had one trait stronger than
                  another, it was truthfulness. Mr. Dent was satisfied that no mischief had been
                  done so far, and he intended to preclude the possibility of mischief. "How stupid
                  of me," he reflected, "to put the notion into the fellow's head!" He would cover
                  his maladroit move by getting his nephew into a New York banking-house or an
                  insurance office at once. The sooner Jack made a start in life the better. Mr.
                  Dent bit off the end of his cigar, and, taking a light from the young man, said,
                  "Of course, Jack, I did n't seriously think you had."</p>
               <p>With this he rose and was about to leave the summer-house.</p>
               <p>"Are you going to town, uncle?" inquired John Dent, looking up.</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"I'll walk a bit of the way with you, if you like."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Jack."</p>
               <p>As the garden gate closed on uncle and nephew, Prudence looked out of the
                  bay-window over the hall door, and her busy, intelligent needle came to a dead
                  halt half-way through a piece of cambric muslin. She was aware that<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000027"/> her guardian was going to town; but it was not one
                  of John Dent's habits to take long walks with his uncle. Prue pondered the
                  circumstance for a minute or so, and then the needle went on again as busily as
                  before.</p>
               <p>"Uncle Ralph," said John Dent, as they reached a rise of ground overlooking the
                  spires and gables of Rivermouth and the picturesque harbor, where a man-of-war lay
                  at anchor with its masts and spars black against the sparkling atmosphere, "I had
                  half resolved to say something to you this morning, but after your question in the
                  summer-house I feel it my duty to say it."</p>
               <p>"What is that, Jack?"</p>
               <p>"I told you I had not been making love to Miss Palfrey, but I am bound to tell you
                  that I love her all the same."</p>
               <p>"What! why, I never heard of such madness!" And Mr. Dent stopped short in the
                  middle of the road.</p>
               <p>"I did n't suppose it would meet with your approval, sir."</p>
               <p>"My approval? I tell you I never heard of such insanity!"</p>
               <p>"I know it is unfortunate," said John Dent, humbly; "but there are things which no
                  man can help."</p>
               <p>"But a man should help falling in love with a girl when he is not able to provide
                  birdseed for a canary."</p>
               <p>"The birdseed will come in good time; it always does."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent's glance, by the merest accident, rested on the red-brick Almshouse which
                  loomed up on the left. John Dent followed his glance, and colored.</p>
               <p>"Do you expect a young woman to waste the bloom of her life waiting for you, and
                  finally go with you over there?"</p>
               <p>"The girl who will not wait a year or two, or ten years, for the man she loves, is
                  not worth working for," said John Dent, nettled.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Dent cursed himself for his blindness in bringing these two together.</p>
               <p>"And Prue loves you?" he gasped.</p>
               <p>"I did n't say that, sir."</p>
               <p>"What in the devil did you say, then?"</p>
               <p>"I said I loved her. I think she does n't care a straw for me."</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5557-00000028"/>
               <p>"But you spoke of her waiting for you a year or two."</p>
               <p>"That was merely a supposititious case."</p>
               <p>"Have you hinted anything of this to Prue?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir."</p>
               <p>"Then I depend on your honor not to. I won't have it! I won't have it!" And Mr.
                  Dent stood there quite white with anger.</p>
               <p>"You will bear in mind, Uncle Ralph, that I need not have told you this."</p>
               <p>"That would have been dishonorable."</p>
               <p>"It would have been dishonorable, sir; and so I came to you directly, without
                  breathing a word to Miss Palfrey. I did not forget I was under your roof."</p>
               <p>Certainly John Dent had not been dishonorable, however mad. Mr. Dent knew that his
                  nephew was wrong in falling in love with his ward, and that he himself was right
                  in being indignant; yet he was conscious that his young kinsman had in a fashion
                  disarmed him.</p>
               <p>"This is exceedingly awkward," he said, after a silence. "I was very glad to have
                  you at Willowbrook, but with this extraordinary avowal—"</p>
               <p>John Dent interrupted him: "Of course my visit is at an end. I knew that. I shall
                  leave to-day."</p>
               <p>"What are your plans?"</p>
               <p>"I have none, that is, nothing definite."</p>
               <p>"I mean, where are you going?"</p>
               <p>"O, I shall take a room somewhere in the town for the present."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent did not like that. The nice sense of honor which had sealed the young
                  man's lips while beneath the avuncular roof might take wing under different
                  circumstances. Rivermouth was a strong strategical position from which to lay
                  siege to Willowbrook. Mr. Dent did not like that at all.</p>
               <p>"Why waste your time in Rivermouth? There is no opening for you there. Why not go
                  to Boston, or, better still, to New York" (or to Jericho, Mr. Dent interpolated
                  mentally), "where there are countless chances for a young man like you?"</p>
               <p>"I can live more economically in the town. Besides, I do not intend to settle in
                  any of our Eastern cities. I shall go to some new country where there are wider
                  and less crowded<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5557-00000029"/> ed fields for
                  enterprise, where fortunes are made rapidly. I wish to make my pile at once."</p>
               <p>"Quite a unique, case," Mr. Dent could not refrain from remarking.</p>
               <p>"Then," continued John Dent, shedding the sarcasm placidly, "I shall come back and
                  ask Miss Palfrey to be my wife, if her heart and hand are free."</p>
               <p>"You will do me the favor to delay the question until you come back," cried Mr.
                  Dent, whose wrath was fanned into flame again. "If you insist, on idling about
                  Rivermouth, I insist on your promise that you will not explain your views to Miss
                  Palfrey."</p>
               <p>"I will not make any promises," returned John Dent, "because I, have a unfortunate
                  habit of keeping them."</p>
               <p>Was it possible that Prue was tangled, even ever so slightly, in the meshes of the
                  same net that had caught this luckless devil-fish? After his nephew's confession,
                  Mr. Dent was prepared for almost anything.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent said: "But unless you do give me some such assurance, I shall be
                  constrained to forbid your visits to the house, and that would cause people to
                  talk."</p>
               <p>"Even with that alternative I cannot make you any promise. To be candid, I have
                  n't at this moment the faintest intention of telling Miss Palfrey what my
                  sentiments are. It is not likely I shall see her again, since you have walled up
                  the doors of Willowbrook," he added, with a smile. "Uncle Ralph, let us talk
                  sense."</p>
               <p>"Thanks for the compliment implied."</p>
               <p>"Don't mention it," said Jack, politely.</p>
               <p>"Look here," said Mr. Dent, resting his hand on his young kinsman's shoulder, "I
                  do not want to shut my doors on you. It annoys me beyond measure to have my
                  brother Ben's boy flying in the face of reason in this way, and setting himself up
                  in antagonism to me, his best friend. Come, now, Jack, don't be a simpleton. Go to
                  New York, look up some business or profession to your taste, and you shall have
                  any capital you require, if you will give over this foolishness about Prue."</p>
               <p>"I could not do it, Uncle Ralph. I love her."</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5557-00000030"/>
               <p>He had said that before quietly enough. The words were spoken passionately this
                  time, and they went through Mr. Dent's heart with inexplicable sharpness.</p>
               <p>"I love her, and I should despise myself if I could be bought. All the chances are
                  against me, I know; but if I cannot have her, I can at least try to be worthy of
                  her."</p>
               <p>"Stuff and nonsense! How many girls have you fallen in love with before now?"</p>
               <p>"Seven or eight, first and last, as nearly as I can remember," replied young Dent,
                  candidly; "but there was no Prudence Palfrey among them. I think that when a man
                  loves a girl like her, he loves but once."</p>
               <p>"All this comes of your verse-writing and moonshine. I don't know where you got
                  them from. Your father was a plain, practical man, and kept his head cool. When I
                  was a young fellow—"</p>
               <p>"You fell in love with Mercy Gardner," cried John Dent, "and never loved any but
                  her."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent winced a little as he parried tile thrust.</p>
               <p>"But I could not have her, and I made the best of it, like a sensible man. You
                  cannot have her daughter, and you are making the worst of it, like an obstinate
                  fellow."</p>
               <p>"But I am not sure I cannot have the daughter—some time."</p>
               <p>"I tell you so."</p>
               <p>John Dent decapitated a thistle with one impatient stroke of his cane. Off came
                  his uncle's head—by proxy!</p>
               <p>"When Miss Palfrey tells me with her own lips to go about my business, then it
                  will be time enough for me to draw on those stores of philosophy and hard
                  common-sense which are supposed to be handed down in the Dent family."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent's anger flashed out at that, and it must be owned his nephew was
                  exasperating.</p>
               <p>"I command you never to speak to her of this!"</p>
               <p>"But I must, one of these days."</p>
               <p>"You refuse positively to quit Rivermouth?"</p>
               <p>"At present I do."</p>
               <p>And you will make no promise relative to Miss Palfrey?"</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5557-00000031"/>
               <p>"I cannot do that, either, sir."</p>
               <p>"Then you cannot call at the house, you know," cries Mr. Dent. "I forbid you to
                  speak to her when you meet her, on the street or elsewhere, and I'll have nothing
                  to do with you from this out!"</p>
               <p>And Mr. Dent turned on his heel and walked rapidly down the road in the direction
                  of Willowbrook, forgetful of those two ounces and a half of scarlet Saxony wool
                  which he had been commissioned by Prue to purchase at Rivermouth.</p>
               <p>"'How poor are they that have not patience'!" said the young man to himself; then
                  he added, a second after, "How poor are they that have not prudence!" probably
                  meaning Prudence Palfrey.</p>
               <p>John Dent looked at his cigar. It had gone out. He threw the stump among some
                  barberry-bushes by the stone-wall, and set his face towards the town.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>JOHN DENT did not return to Willowbrook to dinner. The meal was
                  passed in unwonted silence. Mr. Dent was preoccupied, and Prudence was conscious
                  of something in the atmosphere inimical to conversation. Once or twice her
                  guardian looked up from his plate as if to address her, and then seemed to change
                  his mind.</p>
               <p>"Where is Cousin John?" at length asked Prudence, setting the almonds and raisins
                  nearer to Mr. Dent.</p>
               <p>"O, by the way, I forgot to say he was not coming to dinner! He—he dines in
                  town."</p>
               <p>"At the Blydenburghs'?"</p>
               <p>There was a certain Miss Veronica Blydenburgh, and a very pretty girl, let me tell
                  you.</p>
               <p>"I don't know. How should I know?" replied Mr. Dent, crisply.</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5557-00000032"/>
               <p>"Will he return to tea?" ventured Prudence, after a pause.</p>
               <p>"I don't think he will," Mr. Dent said, pushing back his chair. "In fact, I do not
                  think he will return here at all; he has some matters in town requiring his
                  attention for a few days, and then he is off. He sent good-by to you," added Mr.
                  Dent, committing a little amiable perjury in the attempt to rob his nephew's
                  sudden departure of its brusqueness.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Dent walked out of the dining-room.</p>
               <p>"Not coming back at all, and sent good-by to me?" said Prudence to herself.
                  "Assuredly, Cousin John has not strained many points to be polite, after being our
                  guest for six weeks."</p>
               <p>Then she recalled the walk which Cousin John had taken with his uncle in the
                  morning; she put this and that together, and became contemplative.</p>
               <p>As Prudence and her guardian were sitting on the piazza an hour or two later, Clem
                  Hoyt, the local Mercury and expressman, drove up to the gate with an order for Mr.
                  J. Dent's trunk, and an unsealed note for Miss Palfrey which Mr. Dent handed to
                  her with an indescribable grimace.</p>
               <p>The writer expressed his regret on not being able to say his adieux to her in
                  person; he had been called away unexpectedly; he would never forget her kindness
                  to him during the past six weeks, but would always be her very faithful cousin
                  John Dent. That was all.</p>
               <p>Prudence turned the paper over and over, and upside down, to see if a postscript
                  had not escaped her; but that was the whole of it. It was almost as telegrammatic
                  as the royal epistle to the queen in "Ruy Blas,"—<hi rend="i"/>Madam, the wind is
                  high, and I have killed six wolves.</p>
               <p>"Uncle Ralph," said Prue, folding up the note and slipping it back into the
                  envelope, "I know that something unpleasant has happened."</p>
               <p>"What does he say?"</p>
               <p>"He?—nothing. But something has happened."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent tilted back his chair and made no rejoinder.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5557-00000033"/>
               <p>"What is it? Have you quarrelled with him?"</p>
               <p>"We did have a misunderstanding."</p>
               <p>"What about, uncle?"</p>
               <p>"About money matters chiefly."</p>
               <p>"If it was all about money," said Prudence, "I have no business to ask
                  questions."</p>
               <p>"The boy made a fool of himself generally," returned Mr. Dent incautiously.</p>
               <p>"Then it was not money chiefly?" said Prudence, walking up to him and looking into
                  his eyes. "Uncle Ralph, was it anything connected with me?"</p>
               <p>"Prue, my dear, I would rather not discuss the subject."</p>
               <p>"But, uncle, if it was about me, I ought to know it. It would make me very unhappy
                  to be the cause of dissension between you and your nephew, and not know what I
                  have done. I might keep on doing it all the time, you know."</p>
               <p>"You have n't done anything, child; it is Jack's doing."</p>
               <p>"<emph>What</emph> is Jack's doing?"</p>
               <p>"Since you will have it, I suppose I must tell you."</p>
               <p>But Mr. Dent was at a loss how to tell her, and hesitated. Should he treat the
                  affair lightly or seriously? The idea of Prue having a lover was both comical and
                  alarming to him.</p>
               <p>"Well, what did Cousin John do?"</p>
               <p>"He did me the honor, this morning, to say that he was in love with you,—did you
                  ever hear anything so absurd?"</p>
               <p>Prudence opened her eyes wide.</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"Well? Well, I thought it rather absurd myself."</p>
               <p>"That anybody should love me?" said Prue, slyly.</p>
               <p>"Not at all; but that Jack, should allow himself to be interested in any one under
                  the circumstances. I pointed out to him the mistake of his even dreaming of
                  marriage in his present position. What folly! Setting you entirely aside, what
                  could Jack do with a wife? She would be a millstone tied to his neck. Of course I
                  refused to sanction his insanity, and offered to establish him in business if he
                  would behave himself sensibly."</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5557-00000034"/>
               <p>"That is, if he would n't love anybody?"</p>
               <p>"Precisely."</p>
               <p>"And then what did he say?" asked Prudence, leaning on her guardian's arm
                  persuasively, and smiling up in his face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent was pleased to see that his ward took the matter with so much composure,
                  and felt that the subject was one which could be treated best from a facetious
                  point of view.</p>
               <p>"He said he'd see me—no, he did not say that exactly; but he meant it. He declared
                  he would go off somewhere and make his fortune in a few weeks, or hours, I forget
                  which, and then come back and marry you—pretty much without consulting anybody's
                  taste but his own. Upon my word, Prue, I think there is something wrong with his
                  brain. He refused my advice and assistance point-blank."</p>
               <p>"Then you quarrelled?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I suppose we quarrelled. He was as unreasonable as a lunatic. He cut off my
                  head," said Mr. Dent, grimly.</p>
               <p>"Cut off—your head?"</p>
               <p>"Substantially. He snipped off the top of a thistle with his walking-stick, and
                  looked me straight in the eye, as much as to say, 'Consider your head off!'"</p>
               <p>"Oh!" cried Prue, faintly. "But how did it end?"</p>
               <p>"It ended by my forbidding him to come to the house."</p>
               <p>Prue's hand slipped from her guardian's shoulder with a movement like
                  lightning.</p>
               <p>"You turned him out of doors!"</p>
               <p>"Well, perhaps that is stating it rather strongly."</p>
               <p>"It was generous in him not to speak of his love to me, and brave of him to go to
                  you,—and you have turned him out of doors!" and Prue's eyes flashed curiously.</p>
               <p>Now it was not, perhaps, a frightful thing in itself, Prue's eyes flashing; but
                  since she was a baby, when her eyes could not flash, she had never given Mr. Dent
                  such a look, and it all but withered him. It was so sudden and unlike her!</p>
               <p>"Why, Prue!" he managed to cry, "you don't mean to say you love the fellow!"</p>
               <p>"I do love him!" cried Prudence, with red cheeks. "I did n't love him, but you
                     have<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5557-00000035"/> made me love him! I have beggared
                  him, and made him wretched besides, and I'd marry him to-morrow if he'd ask
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"Gracious heaven, Prue! what else could I do?"</p>
               <p>"You ought to have sent him to <emph>me!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Struck by this reply into "amazement and admiration," Mr. Dent found no words at
                  his command as the girl glided by him and into the house.</p>
               <p>"And Prue loves him," he said, in a subdued voice, leaning against the balustrade
                  heavily, like a wounded man, "my Prue!"</p>
               <p>Between his nephew and his ward Mr. Ralph Dent had had a hard day of it.</p>
               <p>If John Dent could have caught only an echo of Prudence Palfrey's words as she
                  swept by her guardian that afternoon, he would not have been the forlorn creature
                  he was, over there in Rivermouth, trying to read musty books on knotty doctrinal
                  points, borrowed from Parson Hawkins's library, but forever leaving them to wander
                  down to points on the river, where was afforded what the poet Gray would have
                  called "a distant prospect" of Willowbrook chimneys.</p>
               <p>A week lad passed since the rupture with his uncle, and Dent's plans were matured.
                  He had fallen in with a brother knight-errant, a Rivermouth boy and quondam
                  schoolmate of his, and the two had agreed to set forth together in search of
                  fortune. Their plan was to go to San Francisco overland, and, failing of
                  adventures there, to push on to the mining districts. It was a mad idea, and John
                  Dent's own. The day had long gone by when great nuggets were unearthed by private
                  enterprise in California; but he had drawn the notion into his brain that his
                  fortune was to be made at the mines. How or when the fancy first took possession
                  of him I cannot say. Perhaps the accounts of the Australian gold-fields, then a
                  comparatively recent discovery, had something to do with it; perhaps it was born
                  solely of his necessity. He wanted money, he wanted a large quantity, and he
                  wanted it immediately. A gold-mine seemed to simplify the matter. To bring it down
                  to a fine point, it was a gold-mine he wanted. He brooded over<pb n="66-67"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000036"/> the subject until it became a fixed fact in his
                  mind that there was a huge yellow nugget waiting for him somewhere, hidden in the
                  emerald side of a mountain or lying in the bed of some pebbly stream among the
                  gulches. Æons and æons ago Nature had secreted it in her bounteous bosom to lavish
                  it lovingly on some man adventurous and faithful above the rest. The Golden Fleece
                  at Colchis was not more real to Jason and his crew than this nugget finally became
                  to John Dent. He was a poet in those days. Every man is a poet at some period of
                  his life, if only for half an hour.</p>
               <p>In Parson Hawkins's library was a work on metallography, together with a certain
                  history of the gold-fever in the early days of California: young Dent had pored
                  over these volumes as Cervantes's hero pored over the books on chivalry, until his
                  brain was a little touched; and also like the simple gentleman of La Mancha, John
                  Dent had not been long in finding a simpler soul to inoculate with his madness,—to
                  wit, Deacon Twombly's son Joe.</p>
               <p>Their preparations for the journey were completed pleted, and Joseph Twombly, set
                  on fire by his comrade's enthusiasm, was burning to be gone; but John Dent
                  lingered irresolutely day after day in the old town by the river. An unconquerable
                  longing had grown up in his heart to say good by to Prudence Palfrey.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the days were passing tranquilly but not happily at
                  Willowbrook.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent was silent and gloomy, and Prudence had lost her high spirits. She had
                  also lost a rose or two from her cheek, but they came back impetuously whenever
                  she thought of the confession she had made to her guardian. It had been almost as
                  much a surprise to herself as to him. John Dent's name had not been breathed by
                  either since that afternoon. Whether he was still at Rivermouth or not, neither
                  knew. Both had cast a hasty glance over the congregation, on entering the church
                  the succeeding Sunday, one half dreading and the other half hoping he might be
                  there; but John Dent, seated in the gallery behind the choir, had eluded them. He
                  sat with his eyes riveted on the back of Prue's best bonnet, and it had not done
                  the young man any appreciable good.</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5557-00000037"/>
               <p>As matters stood Prudence could not, and Mr. Dent did not, go to Rivermouth.
                  Having declared to him that she loved a man who had not asked her for her love,
                  she had cut herself off from the town while young Dent remained there. This
                  involved a serious deprivation to Prue, for she longed to carry her trouble to the
                  good old parson in Horseshoe Lane, who had been her counsellor and comforter in
                  all her tribulations as far back as she could remember.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of the second week Prudence became restless. No doubt John Dent
                  had quitted the place long ago. And suppose he had not? suppose he had decided to
                  live there? Was she to shut herself up forever like a nun? There were calls owing
                  in town, at the Blydenburghs' and elsewhere. The whole routine and pleasure of
                  life was not to be interrupted because her uncle had quarrelled with his
                  nephew.</p>
               <p>At the breakfast-table she said; "I am going to town this morning, uncle."</p>
               <p>"Will you have the phaeton?" asked Mr. Dent, but not with effusion, as the French
                  say.</p>
               <p>"I think I shall walk, for the sake of the exercise."</p>
               <p>"But, Prue—"</p>
               <p>"If you infer that I am going to town to hunt up a young man who ran away from
                  me," Prudence broke out with a singular dash of impatience, "I will stay at
                  home."</p>
               <p>"I do not infer anything of the kind," Mr. Dent answered. "I was simply going to
                  say you had better ride; it is dusty walking."</p>
               <p>Prudence bit her lip.</p>
               <p>"I want you to be your own sensible self, Prue. You are very strange recently.
                  Many a time you must have felt the lack of a gentler hand than mine to guide you.
                  You never needed guidance more than now. I wish I knew what wise words Mercy would
                  speak to her child, if she were alive."</p>
               <p>Prudence rose from her chair and went over to his side.</p>
               <p>"If my mother were here, I think she would tell me to ask your forgiveness for all
                  the annoyance I have been to you from the time I was a baby until now. I am very
                  sorry for the way I spoke the other day. I could not<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000038"/> help l-liking John Dent, but I need n't have been a
                  fierce wolf about it, need I?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent smiled at the fierce wolf, but he could not help recognizing the
                  appositeness of simile. It was the first time he had smiled in two weeks, and it
                  was to Prudence like a gleam of pure sunshine after dog-days. So the cloud between
                  them broke, floated off a little way, and halted; for life to these two was never
                  to be just what it had been.</p>
               <p>"If you don't wish me to go—" said Prue, meekly.</p>
               <p>"But I do," Mr. Dent answered. Then he made a forlorn effort to be merry, and bade
                  her hurry off to town and get married, and come back again as soon as
                  possible.</p>
               <p>And Prue said she would. She resolved, however, that if by any chance John Dent
                  was still in Rivermouth, and if by any greater chance she encountered him,—and
                  nothing was more remote from her design,—she would behave with faultless
                  discretion. She would not marry him to-morrow, now, if he asked her; she loved
                  him, but her love should never be a millstone about his neck. That phrase of her
                  guardian's had sunk into her mind.</p>
               <p>As she drew near the town, and saw the roof-tops and spires taking sharper
                  outlines against the delicate lilac sky, her pulse quickened. What if she were to
                  meet him on the bridge, or run against him suddenly at a street corner? Would his
                  conceit lead him to suppose she was searching for him, or even wished to meet
                  him?</p>
               <p>The thought sent the blood blooming up to her temples, and she was half inclined
                  to turn back. Then, with a little imperious toss of the head, like a spirited pony
                  taking the bit between its teeth, she went on.</p>
               <p>Prudence avoided the main thoroughfares, and, by a circuitous route through
                  Pickering's Court, reached the gate of the parsonage without accident. She closed
                  the gate behind her carefully, with a dim apprehension that if she let it swing to
                  with a bang, John Dent, walking somewhere a mile or two away, might hear the click
                  of the latch and be down on her. An urchin passing the house at that instant gave
                  a shrill whistle through his fingers, in facile imitation of a steam-engine, and
                  the strength went quite out of Prue's knees. Smiling<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000039"/> ing at her own nervousness she ran up the gravelled
                  walk.</p>
               <p>At the farther end of the piazza, completely screened by vines from the street,
                  sat John Dent, with corrugated brow, reading Adam Smith on "The Wealth of
                  Nations."</p>
               <p>As Prudence stretched out her hand towards the knocker, the young man looked up
                  wearily from the book and saw her, and then her eyes fell upon him.</p>
               <p>"I—I thought you had gone!" stammered Prudence, grasping at the flat-nosed brass
                  cherub for support.</p>
               <p>"No, I have n't gone yet," replied John Dent, with beaming countenance.</p>
               <p>"So I see," said Prue, recovering herself.</p>
               <p>"I hated to go without saying good by to you, and of course I could not come to
                  the house."</p>
               <p>"Of course not," said Prue.</p>
               <p>"And so I waited."</p>
               <p>"Waited for me to come to you!" cried Prue, flushing. "You might have waited a
                  long time if I had suspected it."</p>
               <p>"And you would n't have come?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>A No kept on ice for a twelvemonth could not have been colder than that.</p>
               <p>"Are you angry with me, too?"</p>
               <p>"I am very angry with you. You were entirely in the wrong to quarrel with your
                  uncle, John Dent; he was your only friend."</p>
               <p>"He left me no choice, you see. I went to him in great trouble and uncertainty,
                  wanting kindly advice, and he treated me harshly, as I think. Unless he has told
                  you why we fell out I shall say nothing about it. Did he tell you, Prue?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he told me," said Prudence, slowly.</p>
               <p>"What could I do but go to him?"</p>
               <p>"I was very sorry it happened."</p>
               <p>"What if I had come to you instead?"</p>
               <p>"I should have been still more sorry."</p>
               <p>"Then after all," said John Dent, "it seems that I chose the lesser evil. There is
                  some small merit in that. But the mischief is done,—the cat has eaten the
                  canary,—and the only atonement I call make is to take myself off as soon as may
                  be. I cannot tell you what a comfort it is to see you once more. I have<pb
                     n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5557-00000040"/> spent two or three hours here every day,
                  hoping some lucky chance would bring you. Parson Wibird, you know, was my father's
                  most intimate friend when our family lived in the town, and I did n't seem to have
                  any one nearer to me; so I've given him a good deal of my unpleasant society. I
                  have been reading the parson's theological works," he went on with a dreary air,
                  "and some books on mining, and I'm pretty well up on the future state and
                  geology."</p>
               <p>It was all Prudence could do not to laugh.</p>
               <p>"But the minutes hung on my hands, I can tell you. About the wretchedest hours of
                  my life I have passed on that little pine seat yonder."</p>
               <p>Many a time afterwards Prudence recalled these words, sitting disconsolately
                  herself on that same green bench under the vines.</p>
               <p>"All that is past, now you are here; but I don't believe I could have stood it
                  another week, even with the hope of seeing you at the end of it. Cousin Prue,
                  there are several things I want to say to you; I hardly know how to say them. May
                  I try?"</p>
               <p>"That depends on what they are," returned Prudence. "There are some things which
                  you should not say to me."</p>
               <p>"I may tell you I love you?"</p>
               <p>"No, you must not tell me that."</p>
               <p>"I need not, you mean. Uncle Ralph has saved me the confusion of confession. If he
                  had trusted me fully I believe I should have gone away with the word unspoken. I
                  don't see the harm of speaking it now. I am very proud of loving you. I know I
                  have laid up a store of unhappiness, may be one that will last me my days; but I
                  shall never regret it. I stand higher in my own estimation that I could n't live
                  in the same house with you week after week and not love you."</p>
               <p>"But I—I never gave you—"</p>
               <p>"Now you are on dangerous ground," said John Dent. "If you hate me, don't tell me;
                  if you love me, don't tell me, for I could not bear that either. I pledge you my
                  honor I don't know, I only hope, and would not know for the world."</p>
               <p>Here was a lover—one man out of ten thousand—who was ready to bind himself hand<pb
                     n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5557-00000041"/> and foot for his sweetheart, and would
                  have no vows from her, even if she were willing to make them. He said nothing less
                  than the truth when he declared his ignorance of the nature of Prue's feelings.
                  She liked him, of course,—that went without saying; but further than that he did
                  not know. He was content to go away with so much hope as lies in uncertainty, and
                  perhaps he was wise.</p>
               <p>"You speak of love and hate," said Prudence, tracing a hieroglyphic on the piazza
                  with the toe of her boot, "as if there was nothing between. What prevents me from
                  being your friend? Your plans and welfare interest me very deeply, and I am glad
                  of the chance to talk with you about them. Where are you going when you leave
                  Rivermouth?"</p>
               <p>"To California."</p>
               <p>"So far!"</p>
               <p>"I am going to the mines,—the only short cut to fortune open to me. I'm sadly in
                  lack of that kind of nerve which enables a man to plod on year in and year out for
                  a mere subsistence. I am not afraid of hard work; I am ready to crowd the labor of
                  half a lifetime into a few months for the sake of having the result in a lump. But
                  I must have it in a lump. I won't accept fortune in driblets. I don't think I
                  would stoop to pick up less than an ounce of gold at a time. I've a conviction,
                  Prue, I shall light on some fat nuggets; they can't all have been found."</p>
               <p>"I hope not," responded Prudence, smiling.</p>
               <p>John Dent did not smile. As he spoke, his face flushed, and a lambent glow came
                  into his eyes, as if he saw rich masses of the yellow ore cropping out among
                  Parson Hawkins's marigold-beds.</p>
               <p>"I have a theory," he said, "that a man never wants a thing as I want this, and is
                  willing to pay the price for it, without getting it. I mean to come back
                  independent, or not at all. I have discovered that a man without money in his
                  pocket, or the knack to get it, had better be in his family tomb,—if he has a
                  family tomb. That is about the only place where he will not be in the way.
                  Moralists, surrounded by every luxury, frown down on what they call the lust of
                  riches. It is one of the noblest of human instincts. The very pen<pb n="78-79"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000042"/> and paper, and the small amount of culture which
                  enables these ungrateful fellows to write their lopsided essays, would have been
                  impossible without it. Some one has said this before,—but not so well," added John
                  Dent, complacently, suddenly conscious that he was hammering away at one of Mr.
                  Arthur Helps's ideas. "There was more sound sense in Iago's advice than he gets
                  credit for. I mean to put money in my purse, Prue, and then come back to
                  Rivermouth, and ask you to be my wife. There, I have said it. Are you angry?"</p>
               <p>"N-o, not very," said Prudence, a little flurried. "But suppose I have married
                  'auld Robin Gray' in the mean time?" she added slyly.</p>
               <p>"You are free to do it."</p>
               <p>"And you'll not scowl at him, and make a scene of it when you come back?"</p>
               <p>"I shall hate him," cried John Dent, as a venerable figure of a possible "auld
                  Robin Gray" limped for an instant before his mind's eye. "No, Prue; I shall have
                  no right to hate him. I shall only envy him. Perhaps I'll be magnanimous if he's a
                  poor man,— though he was n't poor in the ballad,—and turn over my wealth to him;
                  it would be of no use to me without you. Then I'd go back to the wilds again."</p>
               <p>He said this with a bleak laugh, and Prudence smiled, and her heart was as heavy
                  as lead. It required an effort not to tell him that she would not marry though he
                  stayed away a thousand years. If John Dent had asked Prudence that moment if she
                  loved him, she would have thrown her cautious resolves to the winds; if he had
                  asked her to go to the gold-fields with him, she would have tightened her
                  bonnet-strings under her chin, and placed her hand in his. But the moment went
                  by.</p>
               <p>Prudence had moved away from the front door, and seated herself on the small bench
                  at the end of the piazza, much to the chagrin of the Widow Mugridge, who had been
                  feverishly watching the interview, and speculating on its probable nature, from a
                  rear attic window across the street.</p>
               <p>"I must go now," said Prudence, rising hastily. "I promised Uncle Ralph not to be
                  long. I'm afraid I have been long. He will<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5557-00000043"
                  /> wonder what has kept me, and I have not seen the parson yet."</p>
               <p>"I suppose I may write to you?" said John Dent. "I shall want to write only two
                  letters," he added, quickly; "one on my arrival at the mines, and one some months
                  afterwards, to tell you the result of the expedition. As I shall send these
                  letters under cover to Uncle Dent, there will be no offence. I do not ask you to
                  answer them."</p>
               <p>"He cannot object to that," said Prudence. "In spite of what has passed, I am sure
                  he will be glad to hear of your movements, and anxious for your success."</p>
               <p>"I am not so positive on that head."</p>
               <p>"You do him injustice, then," returned Prudence, warmly. "You don't know how good
                  he is."</p>
               <p>"I know how good he is n't."</p>
               <p>"You mistake him entirely. He was willing to look upon you as his own son."</p>
               <p>"But not as his son-in-law," suggested John Dent.</p>
               <p>"He has not told me the particulars of the conversation," said Prudence, "but I am
                  convinced vinced he said nothing to you that was not wise and kind and
                  candid."</p>
               <p>"It was certainly candid."</p>
               <p>"I see we shall not agree on this subject; let us speak of something pleasanter.
                  When are you going away?"</p>
               <p>"My going away is a pleasanter subject, then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, because it is something we cannot easily quarrel over."</p>
               <p>"I shall leave Rivermouth to-morrow. Now that I have seen you, there is nothing to
                  detain us."</p>
               <p>"Us? you don't go alone, then?"</p>
               <p>"No; Joe Twombly is going with me; you know him, the deacon's son. A very good
                  fellow, Joe. His family made a great row at first. He had to talk over the two old
                  folks, six grown sisters, the twins, and the baby. He's been bidding them good by
                  ever since the week before last. I quite envy him the widespread misery he is
                  causing. I have only you and Parson Hawkins in the whole world to say good by to,
                  and you can't begin to be as sorry as six sisters."</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5557-00000044"/>
               <p>"But I can be as sorry as one," said Prue, giving him her ungloved hand, and not
                  withdrawing it. It was as white and cold as a snow-flake.</p>
               <p>"I'd like to know what that Palfrey gal's a-doin' with Squire Dent's nevy on the
                  parson's front piazza," muttered the Widow Mugridge, as she stretched her
                  pelican-like neck out of the attic window.</p>
               <p>"What, Prue!—you 're not crying?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am," said Prudence, looking up through two tears which had been troubling
                  her some time. "Cannot a sister cry if she wants to?"</p>
               <p>"If you are my sister—" And John Dent hesitated.</p>
               <p>Prudence gave a little sob.</p>
               <p>"If you are my sister, you will let me kiss you good-by."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Prudence.</p>
               <p>Then John Dent stooped down and kissed her.</p>
               <p>"Hoity-toity! what's this?" cried Parson Hawkins, appearing suddenly in the
                  doorway with one finger shut in a vast folio, and his spectacles pushed up on his
                  forehead, giving him the aspect of some benevolent four-eyed monster.</p>
               <p>"There's the parson now," soliloquized the Widow Mugridge. "Mebbe he did n't come
                  'fore he's wanted. Sech goin's on!"</p>
               <p>As Prue drew back, she pressed into John Dent's hand a little bunch of fuchsias
                  which she had worn at her throat; he thanked her with a look, and was gone.</p>
               <p>So the two, parted,—Prudence Palfrey to resume the quiet, colorless life of
                  Willowbrook, and John Dent to go in search of his dragons.</p>

               <head type="sub">CONCERNING A SKELETON IN A CLOSET.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>PRUE, on returning home, said nothing to her guardian touching the
                  interview with John Dent at the parsonage.</p>
               <p>She did not intend to hide the matter, but it was all too new and distracting for
                  her to speak about just then. She was flurried, and wanted time to think it over.
                  She lay awake half the night thinking of it, and began reproaching herself for her
                  coldness and coquetry. How generous John Dent had been with her, and how
                  calculating and worldly wise she had been on her part. He was going away to face
                  hardship and danger, perhaps death itself, for her sake,—she understood clearly it
                  was for her sake,—and she had let him go without speaking the word that would have
                  made this comparatively easy for him. It was true, he had begged her not to speak
                  the word; but she might have spoken it like an honest girl. She had given him a
                  marble cheek to salute, when she ought to have thrown her arms around his neck.
                  What was there to prevent her loving him and telling him so?</p>
               <p>The generosity had been wholly on the side of her lover, and no woman is content
                  with that; so Prue's heart warmed to him all the more because she had not been
                  allowed to sacrifice herself in the least, and she fell asleep with the vow upon
                  her lips that if she did not marry John Dent she would never marry.</p>
               <p>At the breakfast-room door the next morning, Prudence met her guardian returning
                  from a walk. He had been marketing at Rivermouth bright and early, and had had the
                  unlooked-for satisfaction of beholding at a distance his nephew and Joseph Twombly
                  standing in the midst of their luggage on the platform of the railway station. But
                  it chanced that on the way home Mr. Dent had picked up a piece of intelligence
                  which turned the edge of his satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"Laws 'a mercy, if that ain't Mr. Ralph Dent!" cried a shrill, querulous voice at
                     his<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5557-00000046"/> elbow, as that gentleman turned
                  into Penhalow Place. It was the Widow Mugridge sweeping the flag-stones in front
                  of her domicile. "Who'd 'a' thought you'd ketch me tidyin' up at bit this airly in
                  the mornin'! It's the airly bird that gits the worm, Mr. Dent. Ben see your nevy
                  off to Califerny, I s'pose! I see him an' Miss Prudence a-chirpin' thicker'n
                  blackbirds over there on the parson's piazzer yisterday forenoon, an' thought
                  likely's not he was goin' away at last. An' Joe, too—dear me! They do say Deacon
                  Twombly's folks is dreffully cut up—</p>
               <p>Buz, buz, buz! Mr. Dent did not wait to hear more, but lifting his hat to the old
                  lady, hurried down the street.</p>
               <p>"I'd wager a cookey, now," said the good soul, leaning on the broom-handle
                  meditatively, and following Mr. Dent's vanishing figure with a lack-lustre blue
                  eye,—"I'd wager a cookey, now, young Dent has ben settin' up to that Palfrey gal,
                  an' there's ben trouble. Thought so all 'long. Clem Hoyt fetched away young Dent's
                  trunk more'n two weeks ago, and he has n't set in the family pew sence. Guess
                  things muster ben purty lively up to Willowbrook house. Well, now, it's cur'ous,
                  how folks will fall to sixes and sevins, 'specially relations, right in the face
                  of their Creater!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent gave Prudence a frigid good morning. He had no heart to arraign her for
                  her seeming duplicity; he had no heart for anything. Prue loved his nephew, and
                  the two had met,—met in secret. One had defied him and the other had deceived
                  him.</p>
               <p>I scarcely know how to describe the emotions and perplexities that beset Mr. Dent
                  at this period, without shearing him of some of those practical attributes which I
                  have claimed for him.</p>
               <p>When his nephew, that day on the road to Rivermouth, declared his intentions
                  regarding Prue, Mr. Dent was startled and alarmed. That Prudence would marry some
                  time or other, had occurred to him faintly as a possibility,—a possibility so far
                  in the future as not to be considered; but John Dent had taught him that the time
                  was come when his hold on Prue would be slight, were the right man to demand her.
                  John Dent was clearly<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5557-00000047"/> not the right man,
                  and Mr. Dent had opposed the arrangement, chiefly, as he imagined, because his
                  nephew was not in a position to marry; but under it all was a strangely born and
                  indefinable jealousy. Prue's declaration on the piazza that afternoon fell upon
                  Mr. Dent like lightning from a cloudless sky; by the flash of her love he saw the
                  depth of his own affection. It sometimes happens, outside the covers of romances,
                  that a man rears an adopted girl from the cradle, and falls in love with her when
                  she gets into long dresses,—that the love creeps into existence unsuspected, and
                  asserts itself suddenly, full-grown. It was something very like this that had
                  happened to Mr. Dent.</p>
               <p>There is said to be a skeleton in every house. Until then there had never been a
                  skeleton at Willowbrook, at least since Mr. Dent owned the property; but there was
                  one now, and Mr. Dent's task henceforth was to see that the ghastly thing did not
                  peep out of its closet. Prudence should never dream of its existence; he would
                  stand a grim sentinel over the secret until the earth covered him and it. He
                  thought it hard, after the disappointment of his youth, that such a burden should
                  be laid upon his later years; but he would bear it as he had borne the other.</p>
               <p>He saw his duty plainly enough, but there were almost insuperable difficulties in
                  the performance of it. It was next to impossible for him to meet Prudence on the
                  same familiar footing as formerly; the unrestrained intimacy that had held between
                  them was full of peril for his secret. He must be always on his guard lest she
                  should catch a glimpse into the Bluebeard chamber where he had hidden his stifled
                  love. An unconsidered word or look might be a key to it. Now it so fell out, in
                  his perplexity as to which was the least dangerous method to pursue, that this
                  amiable and honest gentleman began treating the girl with a coldness and
                  constraint which gradually merged into a degree of harshness he was far from
                  suspecting.</p>
               <p>Acknowledging to herself that she had given her guardian some grounds for
                  displeasure, Prudence was ready to make any advances towards a reconciliation; but
                  Mr. Dent gave<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5557-00000048"/> her no encouragement; he
                  was ice to her. At this stage business called him to Boston, where he remained a
                  fortnight.</p>
               <p>"He will forgive me before he comes home," Prudence said to herself; but he came
                  home as he went away, gelid.</p>
               <p>As she leaned over his chair at bedtime that night to offer him her forehead to
                  kiss, a pretty fashion which had outlived her childhood, he all but repulsed her.
                  Prue shrank back, and never attempted to repeat the caress.</p>
               <p>"He is still angry," she thought, "because he fancies there is some engagement
                  between me and John Dent."</p>
               <p>But she was too proud now, as she had been too timid before, to tell him what had
                  passed at Parson Hawkins's. He evidently knew they had met there; she had
                  forfeited his confidence and respect, and that was hard to bear, harder than John
                  Dent's absence, a great deal. She would have borne that cheerfully if her guardian
                  had let her; but he made even that heavier.</p>
               <p>The old parson was Prue's only resource at this time. Whenever household duties
                  gave her leave, she went straight to the parsonage, and sat for hours on the
                  little green bench under the vines, nearly leafless now, where John Dent had
                  waited for her. She called it her stool of penitence. Here she actually read
                  through Adam Smith on "The Wealth of Nations," a feat which I venture to assert
                  has been accomplished by few young women in New England or elsewhere. It was like
                  a novel to her.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the parson would bring his armchair out on the piazza into the sunshine,
                  and the two would hold long discourses on California and John Dent; for the parson
                  had a fondness for the young fellow; he had taught Jack Latin when he was a kid;
                  besides, the boy's father had been dear to him. How far the young man had taken
                  Parson Hawkins into his confidence, I do not know; but it is presumable that
                  Prudence told her old friend all there was to tell. Often the parson was absent
                  from home, visiting parishioners, and Prudence sat there alone, thinking of John
                  Dent. She had fallen into so pitiable a state that this became<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000049"/> came her sole pleasure,—to walk a mile and a
                  quarter to a place where she could be thoroughly miserable.</p>
               <p>These frequent pilgrimages to Horseshoe Lane filled Mr. Dent with lively jealousy.
                  He grew to hate the simple old gentleman, whose society was openly preferred to
                  his own, though he did not make his own too agreeable.</p>
               <p>He blamed the parson for coming between him and Prudence; most of all he blamed
                  him for allowing John Dent to meet her clandestinely under his roof. He made no
                  doubt but the intriguing old woman-for what was he but an old woman?—had connived
                  at the meeting, very likely brought it about. Perhaps he saw a pitiful
                  marriage-fee at the end of his plots and his traps, the wretched old miser!</p>
               <p>If Prudence was rendered unhappy by her guardian's harsh humor, he was touched to
                  the heart by her apparent indifference. They saw each other rarely now, only at
                  meals and sometimes in the sitting-room after dinner. Mr. Dent spent his time
                  mostly in the library, and Prudence kept out of the way. She no longer played
                  chess with him or read to him of an evening. The autumn evenings were dull and
                  interminable at Willowbrook. If it had been Mr. Dent's purpose to make Prudence
                  miss his nephew every hour of the day, Machiavelli himself could not have improved
                  on the course he was pursuing.</p>
               <p>One afternoon, after nearly three months of this, Mr. Dent received an envelope
                  from his nephew enclosing a letter for Prudence. Mr. Dent's first impulse was to
                  throw the missive into the grate; but he followed his second impulse, and carried
                  it to her, though it burnt his fingers like a hot coal.</p>
               <p>Prudence started and colored when her eyes fell upon the superscription, but she
                  made no motion to take the letter; she let it lie on the table where he had placed
                  it.</p>
               <p>"She wishes to read it alone," said Mr. Dent to himself, bitterly. He was marching
                  off to the door as stiff as a grenadier when Prudence intercepted him.</p>
               <p>"Are we never going to be friends again?" she said, laying her hand lightly on his
                  arm. "Are you never going to like me any more? I begin to feel that I am a
                  stranger in the<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5557-00000050"/> house; it is no longer my
                  home as it was. Do you know what I shall do when I am convinced you have entirely
                  ceased to care for me? I shall go away from you."</p>
               <p>He gave a quick glance at Prudence's face, and saw that she meant it.</p>
               <p>"Go away from me?" he exclaimed. "What in God's world could I do without you!"</p>
               <p>"I cannot go on living here if you don't love me. I have done nothing to deserve
                  your unkindness. I saw John Dent only by chance, I did not go to meet him, there
                  is no engagement between us; but I love him, and shall love him always. I regret
                  every day of my life that I did not tell him so, like an honest girl. That is
                  really my only fault. For all this I ask your forgiveness so far as you consider
                  yourself disobeyed. You have been unjustly severe with me. In a little while your
                  severity will lose the power of wounding, and I shall think only of your
                  injustice."</p>
               <p>Then Prudence walked away and sat down by the work-table.</p>
               <p>Every word of this was a dagger to Mr. Dent. Had he been cruel to her? It was
                  plain he had. He was struck now by the change that had taken place in Prudence
                  within three months. He had not noticed until then how pale she was; there were
                  dark circles under her eyes that seemed to darken her whole face, and the eyes
                  themselves were grown large and lustrous, like a consumptive's. As her hands lay
                  in her lap, he observed how white and thin they were; and his conscience smote
                  him. It was not enough he should keep the skeleton securely locked in its closet;
                  his duty went further; the girl's health and happiness were to be looked after a
                  little, and he had neglected that.</p>
               <p>"Prue," he said, with sudden remorse, "I have been very blind and unreasonable.
                  Only be a happy girl again, and I will ask you to do nothing else except to
                  forgive me for not finding it easy to yield you up to the first young fellow that
                  came along and asked for you. You have been my own girl for so many years, that
                  the thought of losing you distracted me. But we won't speak about that. Write to
                  Jack, and tell him to come home; he shall be welcome to Willowbrook. I'll bury a
                     bushel<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5557-00000051"/> of gold eagles in the lawn for
                  him to dig up, if he is still mad on the subject. All I have is yours and his.
                  What do I care for beyond your happiness?" And Mr. Dent put his arm around
                  Prudence and kissed her much the same as he might have done before John Dent ever
                  came to Rivermouth.</p>
               <p>The wisest way to treat a skeleton is to ignore it. There is nothing a skeleton
                  likes more than coddling: nothing it likes less than neglect. Neglect causes it to
                  pine away—if a skeleton, even in a metaphor, can be said to pine away—and crumble
                  into dust.</p>
               <p>"And now," cried Mr. Dent, "let us see what the young man has to say for
                  himself."</p>
               <p>He never did things by halves, this honest gentleman. When he made beer he made
                  the best beer Rivermouth ever tasted; though he was no longer proud of it.</p>
               <p>He picked up the letter and handed it to Prudence, who could not speak for
                  surprise and joy over this sudden transformation. She sat motionless for a minute,
                  with her eyes bright with tears, and then broke the seal.</p>
               <p>"I'll read it aloud," said Prue primly, as one with authority.</p>
               <p>The letter was not from California, as they had expected, but was dated at an
                  obscure little post-village with a savage name somewhere on the frontiers of
                  Montana.</p>
               <p>Bewildering rumors of gold discoveries in the Indian Territory had caused a change
                  in the plans of the adventurers at the last moment.<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref> 
                 Instead of proceeding to San Francisco, they had struck for the other side of the
                  Rocky Mountains. They were now on their way to the new gold regions. At Salt Lake
                  City, where they had halted to purchase mining implements, tents, provisions,
                  etc., John Dent had been too busy to write; he did not know when he would be able
                  to write again; probably not for several months. They were going into the wilds
                  where postal arrangements were of the most primitive order. The country was said
                  to be infested by bushwhackers, on the lookout for unprotected baggage-trains
                  bound for the diggings, and for lucky miners returning with their spoils. Besides,
                  scouting parties of the Bannock tribe had an
                  <note place="foot" xml:id="note_001">
                     <ref target="#return_001">*</ref>In point of fact, the discovery of gold in
                     Montana took place at a period somewhat later than that indicated here.</note>
                  <pb n="98-99"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000052"/> ugly fashion of waylaying the mail and decorating
                  their persons with cancelled postage-stamps. Under these circumstances
                  communication with the States would be difficult and might be impossible. Dent and
                  Twombly were travelling with a body of forty or fifty men, among whom certain
                  claims already secured were to be divided on their arrival at the point of
                  destination in Red Rock Cañon. Their special mess consisted of Twombly, Dent, and
                  a young man named Nevins, whom they had picked up at Salt Lake City. This Nevins,
                  it appeared, had made a fortune in California in '56, and lost it in some crazy
                  silver-mining speculation two years before. He had come over with a crowd from
                  Nevada, and found himself in Salt Lake City with one suit of clothes and a large
                  surplus of unemployed pluck. He was thoroughly up in gold-digging, a very superior
                  fellow in every way, and would be of immense service to the tyros. The three were
                  to work on shares, Nevins putting his knowledge and experience against their
                  capital and ignorance. John Dent was in high spirits.</p>
               <p>If there was any gold in Montana, he and Twombly and Nevins had sworn to have it.
                  There was no doubt of the gold; and three bold hearts and three pairs of strong
                  hands were going to seek it all they knew. "I thank my stars," he wrote, "that
                  Uncle Dent opposed me as he did in a certain matter; if he had not, I should
                  probably at this moment be lying around New York on a beggarly salary, instead of
                  marching along with a score or so of brave fellows to pick up a princely fortune
                  in Red Rock Cañon."</p>
               <p>"Well, I hope he will pick up the princely fortune, with all my heart," remarked
                  Mr. Dent, when they came to the end of the disjointed and incoherent four
                  pages.</p>
               <p>There was not a word of love in them, and no allusion to the past, except the
                  passage quoted, and the reading had been without awkwardness.</p>
               <p>Prue was relieved, for she had broken the seal with some doubt as to the effect of
                  a love-letter on her guardian even in his present blissful mood; and Mr. Dent
                  himself was well satisfied with the absence of sentiment, though the spirit
                  underlying the letter was evident enough.</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5557-00000053"/>
               <p>"If I were a man," Prudence said, "I would not be a clerk in a shop, or sit all
                  day like a manikin on a stool with a pen stuck behind my ear, while new worlds
                  full of riches and adventures lay wide open for gallant souls. Cousin John was
                  right to go, and I would not have him return, until he has done his best like a
                  man. It will be a great thing for him, uncle, it will teach him self-assurance and
                  —"</p>
               <p>"But, Prue, dear, I don't think that was a quality he lacked," put in Mr. Dent,
                  with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
               <p>"Well, it will do him good, anyhow," said Prue, didactically; then, sinking her
                  voice to a minor key and sweeping her guardian from head to foot with her silken
                  lashes, she added, "and I do not mind so much his being away, now you are kind to
                  me. What trouble could be unbearable while I can turn to you who have been father,
                  mother, lover, and all the world to me!"</p>
               <p>She was rewarding him for his concessions. The words dropped like honey from the
                  girl's lips. An hour before they would have been full of bitterness to him; but he
                  was a new man within these sixty minutes; he had trampled his folly under foot,
                  and was ready to accept as very precious the only kind of affection she had to
                  give him. The color must be lured back into those cheeks and the troubled face
                  taught to wear its happy look again. What a cruel egotist he had been, nursing his
                  own preposterous fancies and breaking down the health of the girl!</p>
               <p>"A perfect dog in the manger," he said to himself, as he marched up and down the
                  garden walks, in the afternoon sunshine, with a lighter heart than he had carried
                  for many a week. "And what a sentimental old dog! I shall be writing verses next,
                  and printing them in the poet's corner in the Rivermouth Barnacle. I declare I am
                  alarmed about myself. A man ought n't to be in his dotage at fifty-six. If Jack
                  knew of this he would be justified in placing me in the State Lunatic Asylum."</p>
               <p>So Mr. Dent derided himself pleasantly that afternoon, and said severer things of
                  his conduct than I am disposed to set down here, though it is certainly a great
                  piece of folly for<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5557-00000054"/> a young lad of
                  fifty-six to fall in love with an old lady of eighteen,—particularly when she is
                  his ward, and especially when she loves his nephew.</p>
               <p>The four or five months that succeeded the receipt of John Dent's letter sped
                  swiftly and happily over the Willowbrook people. Mr. Dent was, if anything, kinder
                  to Prudence than he had ever been. His self-conquest was so complete that on
                  several occasions he led himself in chains, so to speak, to the parsonage, and
                  took a morbid pleasure in playing backgammon with the old clergyman.</p>
               <p>No further tidings had come to them from John Dent; but Prudence had been prepared
                  for a long silence, and did not permit this to disturb her. She was her own self
                  again, filling the house with sunshine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent said to her one day: "Prue, I really believe that you love Jack."</p>
               <p>Prudence beamed upon him.</p>
               <p>"What made you?" asked her guardian, thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"He did."</p>
               <p>"I suppose so; but I don't see how he did it."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, you, did."</p>
               <p>"I?"</p>
               <p>"Yes,—by opposing us!"</p>
               <p>"O, if I had shut my eyes and allowed Jack to make love to you, then you would n't
                  have loved him?"</p>
               <p>"Possibly not."</p>
               <p>"I wish I had let him!"</p>
               <p>"I wish you had," said Prue, demurely.</p>
               <p>"It was obstinacy, then?"</p>
               <p>"Just sheer obstinacy," said Prue, turning a hem and smoothing it on her knee with
                  the rosy nail of her forefinger. Then she leaned one elbow on the work, and,
                  resting her chin on her palm, looked up into her guardian's face after the manner
                  of that little left-hand cherub in the foreground of Raphael's Madonna di San
                  Sisto.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent went on with his newspaper, leaving Prue in a brown study.</p>
               <p>the period preceding John Dent's visit seemed to Prudence like some far-off
                  historical epoch with which she could not imagine herself contemporary. Her
                  existence had been so colorless before, made up of unimportant happy<pb
                     n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5557-00000055"/> nothings. It was so full now of
                  complicated possibilities. A new future had opened upon her, all unlike that
                  eventless one she had been in the habit of contemplating, in which she was, to
                  glide from merry girlhood with its round hats, into full-blown spinstership with
                  its sedate bonnets, and thence into serene old age with its prim caps and
                  silver-bowed spectacles,—mistress of Willowbrook in these various stages, placidly
                  pouring out tea for her guardian and executing <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >chefs-d'œuvre</foreign> in worsted to be sold for the benefit of the
                  heathen.</p>
               <p>This tranquil picture—with that vague background of cemetery which
                     <emph>will</emph> come into pictures of the future—had not been without its
                  charm for Prudence. To grow old leisurely in that pleasant old mansion among the
                  willows, and to fall asleep in the summer or winter twilight after an untroubled,
                  secluded-violet sort of life, had not appeared so hard a fate to her. But now it
                  seemed to Prudence that that would be a very hard fate indeed.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the days wore on, not unhappily, as I have said. Nearly a year
                  went by, and then Prudence began to share the anxiety iety of the Twombly family,
                  who had heard nothing from Joseph since the enclosure sent in John Dent's
                  letter.</p>
               <p>"You remember what he wrote about the uncertainty of the mails," said Mr. Dent,
                  cheeringly. "More than likely the Bannock braves are at this moment seated around
                  the council-fire, with all their war-paint on, perusing Jack's last epistle, and
                  wondering what the deuce he is driving at."</p>
               <p>Prue laughed, but her anxiety was not dispelled by the suggestion. She had a
                  presentiment which she could not throw off that all was not well with the
                  adventurers. What might not happen to them, among the desperate white men and
                  lawless savages, out there in the Territory? Mr. Dent called her his little pocket
                  Cassandra, and tried to laugh down her fancies; but in the midst of his
                  pleasantries and her forebodings a letter came,—a letter which Prudence read with
                  blanched lip and cheek, and then laid away, to grow yellow with time, in a disused
                  drawer of the old brass-mounted writing-desk that stood in her bedroom. It was a
                  letter with treachery and shipwreck<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5557-00000056"/>
                  wreck and despair in it. A great calamity had befallen John Dent. He had made his
                  pile—and lost it. But how he made it and how he lost it must be told by
                  itself.</p>

               <head type="sub">HOW JOHN DENT MADE HIS PILE AND LOST IT.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>IT is an epic that ought to be sung at length, if one had the skill
                  and the time; but I have neither the time nor the skill, and must make a ballad of
                  it. The material of this chapter is drawn chiefly from Joseph Twombly's verbal
                  narrative, and the fragments of a journal which John Dent kept at intervals in
                  those days.</p>
               <p>It was an afternoon in the latter part of September that the party with which Dent
                  and Twombly and Nevins had associated themselves drew rein, on a narrow
                  bridle-path far up the side of a mountain in Eastern Montana. Rising in their
                  stirrups, and holding on by the pommels of their saddles, they leaned over the
                  sheer edge of the precipice and saw the Promised Land lying at their feet. On one
                  side of an impetuous stream, that ran golden in the<pb n="108-109"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000057"/> reflected glow of the remoter peaks, lay a city of
                  tents, pine-huts, and rude brush wakiups, from which spiral columns of smoke
                  slowly ascended here and there, and melted as they touched the upper currents of
                  the wind. Along the cañon, following the course of the stream, were hundreds of
                  blue and red and gray figures moving about restlessly like ants. These were miners
                  at work. Now and then the waning sunlight caught the point of an uplifted pick,
                  and it sparkled like a flake of mica.</p>
               <p>It was a lonely spot. All this busy human life did not frighten away the spirit of
                  isolation that had brooded over it since the world was made. Shut in by savage
                  hills, stretching themselves cloudward like impregnable battlements, it seemed as
                  if nothing but a miracle had led the foot of man to its interior solitude. What a
                  lovely, happy nook it seemed, flooded with the ruddy stream of sunset! No wonder
                  the tired riders halted on the mountain-side, gazing down half doubtingly upon its
                  beauty.</p>
               <p>"Dent," whispered George Nevins, impressively, "there is gold here." Then he sat
                  motionless tionless for a few minutes, taking in every aspect of the cañon. "What
                  gold there is over yonder," he presently added, in the same low voice, "is
                  pulverized, lying in secret crevices, or packed away in the sands of the
                  river-bed; troublesome hard work to get it, too. How neatly Nature stows it away,
                  confound her!"</p>
               <p>"But there is gold?"</p>
               <p>"Tons—for the man that can find the rich spots."</p>
               <p>"And nuggets?"</p>
               <p>"And nuggets."</p>
               <p>"Let us go!" cried John Dent, plunging the spurs into his horse. The rest of the
                  party, refreshed by the halt, followed suit, and the train swept down the
                  mountain-path, the rowels and bells of their Spanish spurs jingling like mad.</p>
               <p>So they entered the Montana diggings.</p>
               <p>More than once on their journey to Red Rock, which had not been without its
                  perils, Dent and Twombly had found Nevins's experience and readiness of great
                  advantage to them,<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5557-00000058"/> and that afternoon,
                  on arriving at the cañon, they had fresh cause to congratulate themselves on
                  having him for a comrade. Two diggers, who were working a pit below them on the
                  ravine, had encroached on their claim, and seemed indisposed to relinquish a
                  certain strip of soil next the stream very convenient for washing purposes. Nevins
                  measured the ground carefully, coolly pulled up the stakes which had been removed,
                  and set them back in their original holes. He smiled while he was doing this, but
                  it was a wicked sort of smile, as dangerous as a sunstroke.</p>
               <p>The men eyed him sullenly, for a dozen or twenty seconds; then one of them walked
                  up to his mate and whispered in his ear, and then the pair strolled off, glancing
                  warily from time to time over their shoulders.</p>
               <p>Dent and Twombly looked on curiously. Dent would have argued the case, and proved
                  to them, by algebra, that they were wrong; Twombly would have compromised by a
                  division of the disputed tract; but Nevins was an old hand, and knew how to hold
                  his own.</p>
               <p>"The man who hesitates in this community is lost," said Nevins, turning to his
                  companions. "If I had not meant fight, they would have shot me. As it was I should
                  have shot them."</p>
               <p>"Why, Nevins!" cried Twombly, "what a bloodthirsty fellow you are, to be
                  sure!"</p>
               <p>"You wait," Nevins said. "You don't know what kind of crowd you have got into.
                  Here and there, maybe, there's an honest fellow, but as for the rest,—jail-birds
                  from the States, gamblers from San Francisco, roughs from Colorado and Nevada, and
                  blackguards from everywhere. Our fellow-citizens in the flourishing town of Red
                  Rock are the choice scum and sediment of society, and I shall be out of my
                  reckoning if the crack of the revolver does n't become as familiar to our ears as
                  the croak of the bullfrogs over there in the alders."</p>
               <p>Nevins had not drawn a flattering picture of the inhabitants of Red Rock; but it
                  was as literal as a photograph.</p>
               <p>The rumors of a discovery, of rich placer diggings in Montana had flown like
                  wildfire through the Territories and the border States,<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000059"/> and caused a stampede among the classes first
                  affected by that kind of intelligence. Two months before, the valley was a
                  solitude. Only the songs of birds, the plunge of a red-deer among the thickets, or
                  the cry of some savage animal, broke its stillness. One day a trapper wandered by
                  chance into the cañon, and got benighted there. In the morning, eating his
                  breakfast, he had stuck his sheath-knife for convenience into the earth beside
                  him; on withdrawing it he saw a yellow speck shining in the bit of dirt adhering
                  to the blade. The trapper quietly got up and marked out his claim. He knew it
                  could not be kept secret. A man may commit murder and escape suspicion, though
                  "murder speaks with most miraculous organ"; but he may never hope to discover gold
                  and not be found out.</p>
               <p>Two months later there was a humming town in Red Rock Cañon, with a population of
                  two thousand and upwards.</p>
               <p>There was probably never a mining town of the same size that contained more
                  desperadoes than Red Rock in the first year of its existence. Hither flocked all
                  the ruffians that had made other localities too hot to hold them,—gentlemen with
                  too much reputation, and ladies with too little; and here was formed the nucleus
                  of that gang of marauders, known as Henry Plummer's Road Agent Band, which haunted
                  the mountain-passes, pillaging and murdering, until the Vigilantes took them in
                  hand and hanged them with as short shrift and as scant mercy as they had given
                  their fellow-men. That is a black page in the history of American gold-seeking
                  which closes with the execution of Joe Pizanthia, Buck Stinson, Haze Lyons, Boone
                  Helme, Erastus Yager, Dutch John, Club-foot George, and Bill Graves,—their very
                  names are a kind of murder.<ref rend="super" target="#note_002"
                     xml:id="return_002">*</ref>
                   And these were prominent citizens of Red Rock
                  when our little party of adventurers set up their tent and went to work on their
                  claim in the golden valley.</p>
               <p>"Nevins has not mistaken the geological any more than he has the moral character

                  journal under date of October 12. "Gold-dust has been found scattered all along
                  the bed of the river, and in some instances lucky prospectors have struck rich
                  pockets; but of those massive nuggets which used to drive men wild in the <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">annus mirabilis</foreign> '49 we have seen none yet, though
                  there is a story afloat about a half-breed finding one as big as a cocoanut! I am
                  modest myself, and am willing to put up with a dozen or twenty nuggets of half
                  that size. It does n't become a Christian to be grasping. <abbr>Mem.</abbr>
                  Digging for gold, however it may dilate the imagination in theory, is practically
                  devilish hard work."</p>
               <p>This is a discovery which it appears was made by our friends long before they
                  discovered the gold itself. For a fortnight they toiled like Trojans; they gave
                  themselves hardly time to eat; at night they dropped asleep like beasts of burden;
                  and at the end of fourteen days they had found no gold. At the end of the third
                  week they had made nearly a dollar a day each,—half the wages of a day-laborer at
                  the East. John Dent, with a heavy sigh, suggested gested that they had better look
                  up a claim for a cemetery.</p>
               <p>"I never like to win the first hand," said Nevins, genially; "it brings bad
                  luck."</p>
               <p>"The fellows from Sacramento, down the stream, are taking out seven hundred a
                  week," remarked Twombly.</p>
               <p>"Our turn will come," Nevins replied, cheerly still, like Abou Ben Adhem to the
                  Angel.</p>
               <p>This was on Sunday. The trio had knocked off work, and so had the camp generally.
                  Sunday was a gala day. The bar-rooms and the gambling-saloons were thronged; at
                  sundown the dance-house would open,—the Hurdy-Gurdy House, as it was called.
                  Lounging about camp, but as a usual thing in close propinquity to some bar, were
                  knots of unsuccessful diggers, anathematizing their luck and on the alert for an
                  invitation to drink. All day Sunday an odor of mixed drinks floated up from Red
                  Rock and hung over it in impalpable clouds.</p>
               <p>The three friends strolled through the town on a tour of observation, and brought
                  up at the door of a saloon where a crowd was gathered. A man had been shot at one
                  of the<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5557-00000061"/> tables, and his comrades were
                  fetching him out, dead, with his derringer, still smoking, clutched in his hand.
                  Following the corpse was a lame individual, apparently the chief mourner, carrying
                  the dead man's hat on a stick. The crowd opened right and left to let the
                  procession pass, and our friends came full upon it.</p>
               <p>Dent and Twombly turned away, sickened by the spectacle. Nevins looked on with an
                  expression of half-stimulated curiosity, and stroked his long, yellow beard.</p>
               <p>"And this is Sunday," thought John Dent. "In Rivermouth, the old sexton is tolling
                  the bell for the afternoon service; Uncle Dent and my little girl are sitting in
                  the high-backed wall-pew,—I can see them now! Uncle Dent preparing to go to sleep,
                  Prue looking like a rose, and Parson Wibird, God bless his old white head! going
                  up the pulpit stairs in his best coat shiny at the seams. Outside are the great
                  silver poplars, and the quiet street, and the sunshine like a blessing falling
                  over all!"</p>
               <p>The close atmosphere of the camp stifled him as he conjured up this picture. He
                  longed to be alone, and, dropping silently behind his companions, wandered off
                  beyond the last row of wakiups and out into the deserted ravine.</p>
               <p>There he sat down under a ledge, and with his elbows resting on his knees, dreamed
                  of the pleasant town by the sea, of Prudence and his uncle, and the old minister
                  in Horseshoe Lane. Presently he took from his pocketbook a knot of withered
                  flowers and leaves; these he spread in the palm of his hand with great care, and
                  held for half an hour or more, looking at them from time to time in a way that
                  seemed idiotic to a solitary gentleman in a slouched hat and blanket-overcoat who
                  was digging in a pit across the gully. What slight things will sometimes entertain
                  a man when he is alone! This handful of faded fuchsia blossoms made John Dent
                  forget the thousands of weary miles that stretched between him and New England;
                  holding it so, in his palm, it bore him through the air back to the little Yankee
                  seaport as if it had been Fortunatus's magic cap.</p>
               <p>It was sunset when Dent sauntered pensively<pb n="118-119"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000062"/> into camp, meeting Twombly and Nevins on the
                  outskirts, looking for him.</p>
               <p>"Jack!" cried Twombly, "you have given me such a turn! It really is n't safe in
                  this place for a fellow to go off mooning by himself. What on earth have you been
                  doing?"</p>
               <p>"Something quite unusual, Joseph,-I've been thinking."</p>
               <p>"Homesick, eh?" said Nevins.</p>
               <p>"Just a little."</p>
               <p>Then they walked on in silence. Nevins stopped abruptly.</p>
               <p>"What is that?"</p>
               <p>"A bit of rock I picked up out yonder; say what it is yourself." And Dent tossed
                  the fragment to Nevins, who caught it deftly.</p>
               <p>"Pyrites," said Nevins, flinging it away contemptuously. "Come and have some
                  supper."</p>
               <p>The instant they were inside the tent Nevins laid his band on Dent's shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Do you happen to remember the spot where you picked up that bit of rock?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, why?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing,—only it was as fine a specimen of silver as we shall be likely to
                  see."</p>
               <p>"Silver!" shouted John Dent, "and you threw it away!"</p>
               <p>"I'll go get it directly, if you'll be quiet. Did you see those two follows
                  watching us? It behooves a man here to keep his eye open on the Sabbath-day."</p>
               <p>He was a character, this Nevins, in his way, through it would be difficult perhaps
                  to state what his special way was. In the gulches, with pick and spade, he was
                  simply a miner who knew his business thoroughly; on horseback he became a part of
                  the horse like a Comanche; when a question in science or literature came up, as
                  sometimes happened between him and Dent, he talked like a man who had read and
                  thought. "Nevins has apparently received a collegiate education," John Dent writes
                  in the diary, "and is certainly a gentleman, though what it is that constitutes a
                  gentleman is an open question. It is not culture, for I have known ignorant men
                  who were gentlemen and learned scholars who were not; it is not money, nor grace,
                  nor goodness, nor station. It is, something indefinable, like poetry, and Nevins
                  has it."</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5557-00000063"/>
               <p>From the hour they met him at Salt Lake City, he had been a puzzle to the two
                  New-Englanders; his talents and bearing were so out of keeping with his
                  circumstances. But, as for that matter, so were John Dent's. Nevins was candor
                  itself, and if he said little of his past life, he did n't hesitate to speak of
                  it, and seemed to have nothing to conceal. One fact was clear to both our
                  Rivermouth friends,—Nevins was worth his weight in gold to them.</p>
               <p>The piece of rock that John Dent had picked up on the mountain-side was, in fact,
                  a fragment of silver-bearing quartz,—the zig-zag thread of blue which ran like a
                  vein across the broken edge betrayed its quality to Nevins at a glance.</p>
               <p>A week after this it was noised through Red Rock that a party from New England had
                  struck a silver lode of surprising richness farther up the valley. That night John
                  Dent wrote a long letter to Prudence. Three nights afterwards the Road Agents
                  overhauled the Walla Walla Express, and the gutted mail-bag was thrown into a
                  swamp.</p>
               <p>Perhaps there was more truth than jest in Mr. Dent's picture of the Bannock
                  chieftains puzzling over the rhetoric of Jack's epistle.</p>
               <p>John Dent's visions of wealth would have been realized in a few months, but
                  unfortunately the silver lode, as if repenting its burst of generosity, abruptly
                  turned coy, and refused to lavish any more favors. Just when their shaft was
                  piercing deeper and deeper into the earth, and their rock growing richer and
                  richer,—just as they had fallen into a haughty habit of looking upon each other as
                  millionnaires,—the lode began to narrow. It was six feet wide when it began to
                  narrow; from that point it narrowed relentlessly day by day for a fortnight, and
                  then was a thin seam like a knife-blade,—then "pinched out" and utterly
                  disappeared. After four weeks of drifting, and shafting, and all manner of
                  prospecting, they failed to find it again, and gave up. Some said it was only a
                  rich "chamber"; some said it was one of those treacherous "pockets"; and some said
                  it was a good "chimney," and was down there yet, somewhere: but whatever its name
                  or its nature might be, Dent, Nevins and<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5557-00000064"
                  /> Twombly recognized the fact that it had got away from them, and that was the
                  main grievance.</p>
               <p>"Anyhow, we have made a fair haul," remarked Nevins, "thanks to you, Jack, for it
                  was you who lighted on the thing."</p>
               <p>"My luck is your luck and Twombly's," Dent replied.</p>
               <p>They had, as Nevins stated, made a fair haul. They had managed to get out close
                  upon a thousand tons of forty-dollar rock before the calamity came, and after all
                  expenses of mining and crushing were paid, they found themselves nearly thirty
                  thousand dollars in pocket.</p>
               <p>Their pile was so large now,—they had reduced it to greenbacks which they
                  concealed on the premises,—and its reputation so much exaggerated, that they took
                  turns in guarding the tent, only two going to work at a time. The presence of
                  thieves in the camp had been successfully demonstrated within the month, and the
                  fear of being robbed settled upon them like a nightmare. Dent had another
                  apprehension, the coming of the cold season. Nevins reassured him on that point.
                  Though the winter was severe in Montana, they were in a sheltered valley; at the
                  worst there would be only a few weeks when they could not work.</p>
               <p>The silver exhausted, they fell to prospecting. After varying fortunes for a
                  fortnight, they had another find, Twombly being the involuntary Columbus. It was
                  gold on this occasion, and though it did not yield so bounteously as the silver
                  lode, it panned out handsomely.</p>
               <p>So the weeks wore away, and the young men saw their store steadily increasing day
                  by day. It was heart-breaking work sometimes, and back-breaking work always; but
                  it was the kind of work that makes a man willing to have his back, if not his
                  heart, broken.</p>
               <p>The winter which Dent had looked forward to so apprehensively was over, and had
                  been propitious to the gold-hunters. Spring-time again filled the valley to the
                  very brim with color and perfume, as a goblet is filled with wine. Then the long
                  summer set in.</p>
               <p>All this while John Dent had refrained from<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000065"/> writing home; it was his design to take Prudence
                  and his uncle by surprise, by walking unheralded into Willowbrook some happy day,
                  with his treasures.</p>
               <p>Those treasures had become a heavy care to the young men. "We keep the dust"—I am
                  quoting from the journal—"in a stout candlebox set into the earth at the foot of
                  the tentpole, and one of us lies across it at night. There have been two attempts
                  to rob us. The other night Joe turned over in his sleep, and found himself
                  clutching a man by the leg. An empty boot was left in his hand, and a black figure
                  darted out of the tent. There was a search the next morning for that other boot.
                  There were plenty of men with two boots, and not a few with none at all; but the
                  man with one boot was wanting, and well for him! If he had been caught it would
                  have been death on the spot; the blackest scoundrels in camp would have assisted
                  at his execution, for there 's nothing so disgusts knaves as a crime of this
                  sort,—when they have n't a finger in it themselves."</p>
               <p>The morning after this attempt at burglary, —it was the second,—the following
                  conversation took place:—</p>
               <p>"It will never do for us to keep all this dust here," said Nevins; "we can't hide
                  it as cunningly as we do the greenbacks."</p>
               <p>"What can we do with it?" asked John Dent.</p>
               <p>"There's an agent here of Tileston &amp; Co.'s who will give us drafts on Salt
                  Lake City, or turn it into bank-notes at a Jewish discount."</p>
               <p>Dent and Twombly preferred the bank-notes.</p>
               <p>"Drafts would be safer," suggested Nevins.</p>
               <p>"Suppose Tileston &amp; Co. should fail?"</p>
               <p>"That is true, again," observed Nevins.</p>
               <p>The bank-notes were decided on, and forty-five slips of crisp paper in all, each
                  with an adorable M on it, were shut up in a leather pocket-book, which they buried
                  in the middle of the tent, piling their saddles over the hiding-place.</p>
               <p>They had now been nearly twelve months at the diggings, and John Dent's share in
                  the property reached five figures. It was not the wealth of his dreams; every day
                  in Wall Street men make three times as much by a scratch<pb n="126-127"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000066"/> of the pen; but it was enough to set him on his
                  feet. With fifteen thousand dollars in his pocket he could ask Prudence Palfrey to
                  marry him. Red Rock was overrun, and the supply of metal giving out. If he
                  remained without lighting on fresh finds, what he had would melt away like snow in
                  the March sunshine. Was it worth while to tempt fortune further? was it likely
                  that two such golden windfalls would happen to the same mortal? He put these
                  questions to Nevins and Twombly, who were aware of the stress that drew him to New
                  England. They knew his love-affair by heart, and had even seen a certain small
                  photograph which John Dent had brought with him from Rivermouth.</p>
               <p>Nevins declared his own intention to hold on by Red Rock. Twombly was for
                  instantly returning home. With fifteen thousand dollars in the Nautilus Bank at
                  Rivermouth, he would snap his fingers at Count Monte Cristo himself, who, by the
                  way, was as real a personage to Twombly as John Jacob Astor. The two New England
                  men decided to join the next large party that started for the East.</p>
               <p>The incalculable sums which our friends were imagined to have accumulated rendered
                  their position critical. They took turns regularly on the night-watch now, and
                  waited with increasing apprehension and impatience for the making up of a train to
                  cross the mountains.</p>
               <p>Red Rock had not improved with time. It seethed and bubbled, like a witch's
                  caldron, with all evil passions. Men who might have been decently honest if they
                  had been decently fortunate, turned knaves. Crowds of successful diggers had
                  already shaken the gold-dust from their feet and departed; only the dissolute and
                  the vicious remained, with here and there a luckless devil who could not get away.
                  The new-comers, and there were throngs of them, were of the worst description.
                  Every man carried his life in his hand, and did not seem to value it highly. It
                  was suicide to stray beyond the limits of the town after dusk. Tents were
                  plundered every night. Now, though murder did not shock the nerves of this
                  community, the thieving did. An attempt was made by indignant citizens of Red Rock
                  to put a stop to that. They went so far as to suspend<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000067"/> from the bough of a butternut-tree one of their
                  most influential townsmen, a gentleman known as the Great American Pie-Eater (on
                  account of certain gastronomic feats performed at Salt Lake City), but the
                  proceeding met with so little popular favor, that the culprit was taken down and
                  resuscitated and invited by his executioners to stand drinks all round at
                  Gallagher's bar,—which he did.</p>
               <p>When the Vigilantes sprung into existence, they managed these things differently
                  in Montana: they did n't take their man down so soon, for one thing.</p>
               <p>"If we had been there by ourselves," said Joseph Twombly, describing Red Rock at
                  this period, "we'd have been murdered in less than a week." But there was, it
                  seemed, something about Nevins that had a depressing effect upon the spirits of
                  sundry volatile gentlemen in camp.</p>
               <p>One morning just before daybreak, John Dent awoke suddenly and sat up in his
                  blankets, trembling from head to foot. At what he did not know. He had not been
                  dreaming, and it was not a noise that had broken his sleep. He looked about him;
                  every object stood out clearly in the twilight; Twombly lay snoring in his
                  shake-down, but Nevins, whose watch it was, was not in the tent. Dent was somehow
                  struck cold by that. He rolled out of the blankets, and crawling over to the spot
                  where the money was hidden, felt for it under the saddles. The earth around the
                  place had been newly turned up, and THEIR POCKET-BOOK WAS GONE!</p>
               <p>The pocket-book was gone, and one of the three saddles—Nevins's—was missing. The
                  story told itself. The outcries of the two men brought a crowd of diggers to the
                  tent.</p>
               <p>"We have been robbed by our partner," cried Twombly, picking up a saddle by the
                  stirrup-strap and hurrying out to the corral for his horse.</p>
               <p>John Dent lay on the ground with his fingernails buried in the loose earth near
                  the empty hole. A couple of worthies, half roughly and half compassionately, set
                  him upon his feet.</p>
               <p>"Do you care to know who that mate of yours was?"</p>
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5557-00000068"/>
               <p>The speaker was a gaunt, sunburnt man, with deer-skin leggins, fringed at the
                  seams and gathered at the waist by a U.S. belt, from which hung the inevitable
                  bowie-knife and revolver. Dent looked at him stupidly, and dimly recognized one of
                  the two miners who had disputed the claim with Nevins that first afternoon in
                  camp.</p>
               <p>"I knew he'd levant with the pile, some day. But I didn't like to let on, for,
                  fear of mistakes. I thought, maybe, you other two was the same kind. I knew that
                  man in Tuolumne County. He's a devil. He's the only man breathing I'm afraid of.
                  No, I don't mind allowing I'm afraid of him. There's something about him, when I
                  think of it,—a sort of cold cheek,—so that I'd, rather meet a Bannock war-party in
                  a narrer gully than have any unpleasantness with that man. His true name was n't
                  Dick King, I reckon, because he said it was. Cool Dick was what they called him in
                  Tuolumne County in '56."</p>
               <p>Several ears in the crowd pricked up at the words Cool Dick. It was a pseudonyme
                  rather well known on the Pacific slope. John Dent had recovered his senses by
                  this.</p>
               <p>"Are there any true lads here," he cried, "that will go with me to bring back that
                  thief?"</p>
               <p>A dozen volunteered at once, and half an hour later twenty armed men galloped out
                  of Red Rock Cañon.</p>
               <p>They returned with jaded horses, at sunset, without having struck the trail of
                  either Twombly or Nevins. The next day, at noon, Twombly himself rode into camp
                  and dropped heavily out of the saddle at the door of the tent. He had a charge of
                  buck-shot in his leg. Some one had fired on him from the chaparral near Big Hole
                  Ranch. It was not Nevins, for he had no gun, so far as known; probably some
                  confederate of his.</p>
               <p>And this was the end of it. This was the result of their twelve months' hardship
                  and industry and pluck and endurance.</p>
               <p>Then John Dent wrote that letter to Prudence, which she laid away in the drawer,
                  telling her the story, not as I have told it, tamely and at second-hand, but with
                  fire and tears. Then, in a few weeks, came Joseph Twombly, limping back into
                  Rivermouth, alone. There<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5557-00000069"/> were no more
                  El Dorados for him, poor knight; he was lamed for life, or he would never have
                  deserted his comrade. John Dent himself had gone off, Twombly did not know where;
                  but to California, he fancied, in search of George Nevins.</p>
               <p>And this was the end of it for Prudence, too. She shut up the letter and her dream
                  in the writing-desk with the brass clamps. It was a year before she could read the
                  letter without a recurrence of the old poignant pain. At the end of another
                  twelvemonth, when she unfolded the pages, the words wore a strange, faded look, as
                  if they had been written by one long since dead, and dealt only with dimly
                  remembered events and persons,—so far off seemed that summer morning when she
                  first read them. She shed no tears now, but held the letter in her hand
                  thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>It was nearly three years since John Dent went away from Rivermouth, and nothing
                  more had been heard of him. A silence like and unlike that of the grave had
                  gathered about his name. Life at Willowbrook flowed back into its accustomed
                  channels. Mr. Dent had disposed of the skeleton effectively and forever, and
                  Prudence had passed into the early summer of her womanhood. It was at this point
                  my chronicle began.</p>
               <p>This was the situation—to borrow a technical term from dramatic art—when the
                  congregation of the Old Brick Church, after much ruffling of parochial plumage,
                  resolved to relieve Parson Wibird Hawkins of his pastorate.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>THIS brings my story again to that afternoon in May, when Prudence
                  Palfrey made her appearance at the cottage in Horseshoe Lane, and was solicited by
                  Salome to speak to the parson, who had locked himself in the little room after the
                  departure of the two deacons.</p>
               <p>It was with an inexplicable sense of uneasiness that Prudence crossed the library,
                  and knocked softly on the panel of the inner door. The parson did not seem to hear
                  the summons; at all events, he paid no attention to it, and Prudence knocked
                  again.</p>
               <p>"He's gittin' the least bit hard of hearin', pore soul," said Salome. "Mebbe he
                  heard that, though," she added, more cautiously, "for he always hears when you
                  don't s'pose he will. Do jest speak to him, honey; he'll know your vice in a
                  minit."</p>
               <p>Prudence put her lips down to the key-hole and called, "Parson Wibird!—it's
                  Prue,—won't you speak to me?"</p>
               <p>He made no response to this, and in the silence that ensued, broken only by the
                  quick respiration of the two women, there was no sound as if he were preparing to
                  undo the fastenings. Prudence rose up with a half-frightened expression on her
                  countenance and looked at Salome.</p>
               <p>"What can have happened?" she said hurriedly.</p>
               <p>"Lord o' mercy knows," replied Salome, catching Prue's alarm. "Don't stare at me
                  in sech a way, dear; I'm as nervous as nuthin'."</p>
               <p>"Are you sure he is there?"</p>
               <p>"Sartin. I all but see him goin' in, an' I have n't ben out of the room sence. He
                  must be there."</p>
               <p>"Is he subject to vertigo, ever?"</p>
               <p>"Dunno," said Salome, doubtfully.</p>
               <p>"I mean, does he ever faint?"</p>
               <p>"He did have a cur'ous sort of spell two or three weeks ago, an' Dr. Theophilus
                  give him some me'dicine for it."</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5557-00000071"/>
               <p>"He has fainted, then! Get a candle—quick. Stop, Salome, I'll go with you."</p>
               <p>Prudence was afraid to remain in the library alone. She was impressed by some
                  impalpable presence in the half darkness. The shadows huddled together in the
                  corners. The long rows of books in their time-stained leather bindings looked down
                  sombrely from the shelves. On the table was an open volume, with an ivory
                  paper-cutter upon it, which he had been reading. His frayed dressing-gown lay
                  across a chair in front of the table. It seemed like some weird, collapsed figure,
                  lying there. All the familiar objects in the room had turned strange and
                  woe-begone in the twilight. Prudence would not have been left alone for the
                  world.</p>
               <p>The two went out together for the candle, which Salome with a trembling hand
                  lighted at the kitchen stove. Then they flitted back to the library silently, with
                  white sharp faces, like ghosts.</p>
               <p>"What shall we do?"</p>
               <p>"We must break in the door," said Prudence under her breath. "You hold the
                  candle."</p>
               <p>She placed her knee against the lower panel and pressed with all her strength. The
                  lock was old and rusty, and the screws worked loosely in the worm-eaten wood-work.
                  The door yielded at the second pressure and flew open, with a shower of fine dust
                  sifting down from the lintel.</p>
               <p>The girl retreated a step or two, and shading her eyes with the palm of her hand,
                  peered into the darkened space.</p>
               <p>Nothing was distinct at first, but as Salome raised the light above Prue's head,
                  the figure of the parson suddenly took shape against the gloom.</p>
               <p>He was sitting in an old-fashioned arm-chair, with his serene face bent over a
                  great Bible covered with green baize, which he held on his knees. His left arm
                  hung idly at his side, and the forefinger of his right hand rested lightly on the
                  middle of the page, as if slumber had overtaken him so, reading.</p>
               <p>"Laws o' mercy, if the parson has n't gone to sleep!" exclaimed Salome, stepping
                  into the small compartment.</p>
               <p>"Asleep!" repeated Prudence, the reassured color returning to her cheek.</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5557-00000072"/>
               <p>Salome laid her hand on the parson's arm, and then passed it quickly over his
                  forehead.</p>
               <p>"He's dead!" cried Salome, dropping the candlestick.</p>
               <p>The hour-hand of the cuckoo-clock in the hall at Willowbrook pointed at seven; the
                  toy bird popped out on the narrow ledge in front of the carved Swiss cottage,
                  shook seven flute-like notes into the air, popped in again hastily, and the little
                  door went to with a spiteful snap.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent glanced at the timepiece over the fireplace in the sitting-room, and
                  wondered what was detaining Prue. She had gone to town on a shopping expedition
                  shortly after dinner, and here it was an hour and a half past tea-time. Fanny had
                  brought in the tea-urn and carried it off again. It was as if the sun-dial had
                  forgotten to mark the movements of the sun; the household set its clocks by
                  Prudence.</p>
               <p>For the last hour or two Mr. Dent had been lounging restlessly in the
                  sitting-room, now snatching up a book and trying to read, now looking out on the
                  lawn, and now vigorously poking the coals in the grate, for it was one of those
                  brisk days which make a fire comfortable in our delusive New England May.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent was revolving in his mind how he should break to Prudence the
                  intelligence of Parson Hawkins's dismissal, and more especially in what terms he
                  should confess his own part in the transaction. "What will Prue say?" was a
                  question he put to himself a dozen times without eliciting a satisfactory reply.
                  He was a little afraid of Prudence,—he had that tender awe of her with which a
                  pure woman inspires most men. He could imagine what she would have said three
                  years ago; but she had altered in many respects since then; she had grown quieter
                  and less impulsive. That one flurry of passion in which she had confessed her love
                  for John Dent did not seem credible to her guardian as he looked back to it. As a
                  matter of course, she would be indignant at the action of the deacons, and would
                  probably not approve of the steps he had taken to bring Mr. Dillingham to
                  Rivermouth; but she would not storm at him. He almost wished<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000073"/> she would storm at him, for her anger was not so
                  unmanageable as the look of mute reproach which she knew how to bring into her
                  gray eyes.</p>
               <p>The cuckoo in the Swiss châlet had hopped out again on the ledge, and was just
                  sounding the half-hour in his clear, business-like way, when Prudence opened the
                  drawing-room door.</p>
               <p>"I thought you had run off for good," said Mr. Dent, rising from his chair; then
                  he stopped and looked at her attentively. "Why, Prue, what is the matter?"</p>
               <p>"The parson—" Prudence could not finish the sentence. The nervous strength that
                  had sustained her through the recent ordeal gave way; she sank upon the sofa and
                  buried her face in the cushions.</p>
               <p>"She has heard of it already," thought Mr. Dent. He crossed to the sofa and rested
                  his hand softly on her shoulder. "My dear girl, you must be reasonable. It had to
                  come sooner or later; he could not go on preaching forever, you know. He is a very
                  old man now, and ought to take his ease. He will be all the happier with the cares
                  of the parish off his hands."</p>
               <p>"All the happier, yes!"</p>
               <p>"And we'll have him up to Willowbrook often; he shall have a room here—"</p>
               <p>Prudence lifted her face beseechingly.</p>
               <p>"O, you don't know! you don't know!" she cried. "He is dead! he died this
                  afternoon, sitting in his chair. Ah!—it was so dreadfully sudden!" And Prudence
                  covered her eyes with her hands as if to shut out the scene in the library.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent was greatly shocked. He leaned against the mantel-piece, and stared
                  vacantly at Prudence, while she related what had happened at Horseshoe Lane. She
                  had completed her purchases in town, and was on the way home when she met Miss
                  Blydenburgh, who told her of the deacons' visit to Parson Hawkins to request his
                  resignation. Knowing that the poor old man was unprepared for any such
                  proposition, she had turned back and hastened down to the parsonage, to say and do
                  what she could to comfort him in his probable distress. Then she and Salome, alone
                  there in the dark, had found him dead in the chair.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent left his tea untasted. He had the<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000074"/> horse saddled, and rode over to town. He was
                  greatly shocked. And Deacon Zeb Twombly, that night, as he stood for a moment
                  beside the cradle in which the little ewe-lamb lay nestled in its blankets, was a
                  miserable man. He crept off to the spare room in the attic—where he was undergoing
                  a temporary but not unprecedented exile—with the conviction that he was little
                  better than a murderer.</p>
               <p>"I hope Parson Wibird will forgive me my share in the business," murmured the
                  deacon, blowing out the candle; then he lingered by the window dejectedly. It was
                  a dreamy May night; the air, though chilly, was full of the odors of spring, and
                  the mysterious blue spaces above were sown thick with stars. "P'rhaps he knows all
                  up there," he said, lifting his eyes reverently, "an' how it went agin me to give
                  him any pain. I wonder how brother Wendell feels about it."</p>
               <p>Deacon Wendell, fortunately or unfortunately, as the case may be, was of that
                  tougher fibre out of which the strong sons of the world are made. He had performed
                  the duty that devolved upon him, as he had performed other unpleasant duties,
                  having been sheriff once, and there was nothing to be said. He was sorry the
                  parson died just as he did. "Looks as though he done it on purpose to spite us,"
                  reflected Deacon Wendell. Perhaps his chief emotion when he first heard the
                  news—it was all over Rivermouth now—was an ill-defined feeling of resentment
                  against Parson Wibird for having cut up rough.</p>
               <p>The effect produced on Mr. Dent was more complex. Though neither so callous as
                  Deacon Wendell nor so soft-hearted as Deacon Twombly, he shared to some extent the
                  feelings of both. He keenly regretted the death of the old parson, and
                  particularly the manner of it. It was an unlucky coincidence,—he could not look
                  upon it as anything more than a coincidence,—and would give rise to much
                  disagreeable gossip. If it had happened a month or two before, or a month or two
                  later, he would have been sorry, as anybody is sorry when anybody dies; but he
                  would not have been shocked. He wished he had not been quite so warm in advocating
                  the desirableness of Mr. Dillingham. If he could have foreseen<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000075"/> the present catastrophe, he would have thrust his
                  hand into the flames rather than move in the matter.</p>
               <p>But what was done was done; and as he urged the mare across the long wooden bridge
                  which ended among the crumbling wharves and shabby warehouses of Market Street, he
                  trusted something would transpire showing that the parson's death was the result
                  of natural causes and in no degree to be attributed to—to what had probably caused
                  it.</p>
               <p>There was an unusual glimmer and moving of lights in the windows of the parsonage,
                  and a mysterious coming and going of shadows on the brown Holland shades, as Mr.
                  Dent turned into Horseshoe Lane. He was within a dozen rods of the cottage, when
                  the gate creaked on its hinges and Dr. Theophilus Tredick passed out, walking off
                  rapidly in an opposite direction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent pushed on after the doctor, and overtook him at the doorstep of a
                  neighboring house.</p>
               <p>"A moment, doctor," said Mr. Dent, leaning over the horse's neck. "Has there been
                  an inquest?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; we have just finished the examination."</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"Paralysis."</p>
               <p>"Attributable to any sudden mental excitement or anything of that nature? You know
                  he had a conversation on church affairs with the deacons this afternoon; could
                  that have affected him in any way?" Mr. Dent put the query anxiously.</p>
               <p>"It would be difficult to say," replied the doctor. "It is open to conjecture of
                  course; but at the worst it could only have hastened what was inevitable. I am not
                  prepared to affirm that it hastened it; in fact, I do not think it did."</p>
               <p>"I do not entirely catch your meaning, doctor," Mr. Dent said.</p>
               <p>"I mean that Parson Hawkins had had two slight strokes of paralysis previously;
                  one last winter and the second three weeks ago. I was apprehensive that the third
                  would terminate fatally."</p>
               <p>"I never heard of that."</p>
               <p>"No one knew of it, I think; not even Mrs.<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000076"/> Pinder, the housekeeper. It was at his own urgent
                  request I kept the matter secret. At the time of the occurrence of the second
                  attack I had a long talk with our friend, and advised him strongly to give up work
                  altogether; finding him obstinate on that point, I urged him to have an assistant.
                  I warned him plainly that he might be taken ill at any moment in the pulpit. He
                  declared that that was the place of all others where he could wish to die; but he
                  promised to consider my suggestion of an associate minister."</p>
               <p>"Which he never did."</p>
               <p>"For the last three Sundays," continued the doctor, "I have gone to church
                  expecting to see him drop down in the pulpit in the midst of the service. He was
                  aware of his condition, and not at all alarmed by it. Though he overrated his
                  strength, and had some odd notions of duty,—he did have some odd notions, our
                  estimable old friend,—he was a man of great clear sense, and I do not believe the
                  recent action of the parish affected him in the manner or to the extent idle
                  people will suppose. What has happened would probably have happened in any
                  case."</p>
               <p>Dr. Tredick's statement lifted a weight from Mr. Dent's bosom, and from Deacon
                  Twombly's when he heard of it; though there were numerous persons in the town who
                  did not hesitate to assert that the parson's dismissal killed him. To look on the
                  darkest side of a picture is in strict keeping with the local spirit; for
                  Rivermouth, in its shortcomings and in its uncompromising virtues, is nothing if
                  not Puritan.</p>
               <p>"Might as well have took a muskit and shot the ole man," observed Mr. Wiggins.</p>
               <p>"Capital punishment ought to be abolished in New Hampshire," said ex-postmaster
                  Snelling, "if they don't hang Deacon Wendell and the rest of 'em."</p>
               <p>Mr. Snelling was not naturally a sanguinary person, but he had been superseded in
                  the post-office the year before by Deacon Wendell, and flesh is flesh.</p>
               <p>The event was the only topic discussed for the next ten days. Parson Wibird had so
                  long been one of the features of the place, that he seemed a permanence, like the
                  brick church itself, or the post-office with its granite façade. If either of
                  these had been spirited off overnight<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5557-00000077"/>
                  night, the surprise and the shock could not have been more wide-spread. That tall,
                  stooping figure, clad always in a rusty suit of black, was as familiar an object
                  on the main street as the swinging sign of the Old Bell Tavern. There were
                  grandfathers and grandmothers who, as boys and girls, remembered Parson Wibird
                  when he looked neither older nor younger than he did that day lying in the
                  coffin,—nay, not so young, for the deep wrinkles and scars of time had faded out
                  of the kindly old face, and the radiance of heavenly youth rested upon it.</p>
               <p>There was one circumstance connected with the old minister's death that naturally
                  made a deeper impression than any other. When Salome summoned the neighbors, that
                  night, they found the parson with the Bible lying open before him, and one finger
                  resting upon the page as if directing attention to a particular passage. There was
                  something startlingly life-like and imperative in the unconscious pointing of that
                  withered forefinger, and those who peered hastily over the slanted shoulder and
                  read the verse indicated never forgot it.</p>
               <p>"Thet was th' parson's las' tex'," said Uncle Jedd, leaning on his spade worn
                  bright with oh! so many graves: "Well done, thou good an' faithful servant, enter
                  thou inter th' joy of thy Lord!"</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>IT was early in the forenoon, six or seven days after the funeral of
                  the parson, that Mr. Dent, who had left the house an hour before to take the
                  morning train for Boston, returned hurriedly to Willowbrook, and, capturing Fanny
                  the housemaid, with broom and dust-pan in the front hall, despatched her to her

               <p>This change in her guardian's purpose, and his message, which was in itself
                  something out of the ordinary way, filled Prudence with wonder. She had packed Mr.
                  Dent's valise for an absence of several days, and she knew it was no trivial
                  circumstance that had made him relinquish or postpone the journey in question.
                  What could it be?</p>
               <p>She was arranging the house-plants in the bay-window room, as it was called, when
                  Fanny delivered Mr. Dent's message.</p>
               <p>"He must have missed the train," said Prudence to herself. But Mr. Dent had gone
                  to town an hour earlier than was necessary to catch the express. "Or perhaps Mr.
                  Dillingham has written that he is not coming, after all." Suddenly an idea flashed
                  upon Prudence and nearly caused her to drop the pot of jonquils which she was in
                  the act of lifting from the flower-stand.</p>
               <p>"he has heard from John Dent!"</p>
               <p>When a friend dies and is buried, there's an end of him. We miss him for a space
                  out of our daily existence; we mourn for him by degrees that become mercifully
                  less; we cling to the blessed hope that we shall be reunited in some more perfect
                  sphere; but so far as this earth is concerned, there's an end of him. However near
                  and dear he was, the time arrives when he does not form a part of our daily
                  thought; he ceases to be even an abstraction. We go no more with flowers and tears
                  into the quiet cemetery; only the rain and the snowflakes<pb n="152-153"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000079"/> flakes fall there; we leave it for the fingers of
                  spring to deck the neglected mound.</p>
               <p>But when our friend vanishes unaccountably in the midst of a crowded city, or goes
                  off on a sea-voyage and is never heard of again, his memory has a singular
                  tenacity. He may be to all intents and purposes dead to us, but we have not lost
                  him. The ring of the door-bell at midnight may be his ring; the approaching
                  footstep may be his footstep; the unexpected letter with foreign postmarks may be
                  from his hand. He haunts us as the dead never can.</p>
               <p>The woman whose husband died last night may marry again within a lustre of months.
                  Do you suppose a week passes by when the woman whose husband disappeared
                  mysteriously ten years ago does not think of him? There are moments when the
                  opening of a door must startle her.</p>
               <p>There is no real absence but death.</p>
               <p>For nearly three years, for two years and a half, to be precise, the shadow of
                  John Dent had haunted Prudence more or less,—the chance of tidings from him, the
                  possibility of his emerging suddenly from the darkness that shrouded him and his
                  movements, had been in her thought almost constantly. Until she saw him once more
                  or knew that he was dead, she was not to be relieved of this sense of expectancy.
                  It was disassociated with any idea or desire that he would claim her love; he had
                  surrendered that; he had written her that he should never set foot in Rivermouth
                  again; he was a wrecked man. It was not for Prudence to cling to a hope which he
                  had thrown over, however unwisely or weakly. She would have waited for him loyally
                  all her life; his misfortune would have linked her closer to him; but he had not
                  asked her to wait, or to share the misfortune; he had given her up, and the
                  obvious thing for Prudence had been to forget him. In a circumscribed life like
                  hers, how was it possible for her to forget that she had loved and been loved? She
                  taught herself to look upon his visit to Willowbrook, and what had subsequently
                  occurred, as a midsummer's day-dream; but beyond that she had not been
                  successful.</p>
               <p>John Dent's name was seldom spoken now either by Prudence or her guardian; to all
                     appearance<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5557-00000080"/> pearance he was
                  obliterated from their memories; but the truth is, there was scarcely a month when
                  both Prudence and Mr. Dent did not wonder what had become of him. "I don't believe
                  she ever thinks of him nowadays," reflected Mr. Dent. "He has quite forgotten
                  him," Prudence would say to herself. But Mr. Dent never took his letters from the
                  languid clerk at the post-office without half expecting to find one from Jack; and
                  Prudence never caught an expression more than usually thoughtful on her guardian's
                  face without fancying he had received news of his nephew.</p>
               <p>The image of John Dent rose up before Prudence with strange distinctness that
                  morning as she stood by the bay-window, and flitted with singular persistence
                  across her path on the way down stairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent was seated at the library table, upon which were spread several
                  legal-looking documents with imposing red-wax seals. His eyebrows were drawn
                  together, and there was a perplexed look on his countenance which at once
                  reassured Prudence; whatever had occurred, it was nothing tragic.</p>
               <p>"We have got hold of the parson's will at last," he said, looking up as she
                  entered the room.</p>
               <p>A will had been found the day following Parson Hawkins's death, in an old hair
                  trunk in which he kept private papers; but Mr. Jarvis, the attorney, declared that
                  a later testament had been executed, different in tenor from this, which was dated
                  fifteen years back. No such document was forthcoming, however, after a most
                  rigorous search among the old clergyman's manuscripts. Mr. Jarvis had drawn up the
                  paper himself ten months before, and was bent on finding it.</p>
               <p>"My client was queer in such matters," he said. "He would keep scraps of verse and
                  paragraphs cut from newspapers in his strongbox at the bank, and have bonds and
                  leases kicking around the library as if they were worthless. You may depend upon
                  it, he stuck this will away in some corner, and forgot it."</p>
               <p>On the sixth or seventh day, when the belief was become general that the parson
                  had destroyed it, the later will was discovered shut up in a copy of the London
                  folio edition of Cotton<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5557-00000081"/> ton Mathers
                  "Magnalia," on a shelf in the little room where the parson had died.</p>
               <p>"He has left Salome a life-interest in the cottage and an annual sum for her
                  support, to revert at her death to the main estate."</p>
               <p>"I am glad of that," said Prudence. "Poor Salome!"</p>
               <p>"And the residue of the property," continued Mr. Dent, "after deducting a few
                  minor bequests,—how do you think be has disposed of that?"</p>
               <p>"I am sure I cannot imagine. He had no near relatives. To the Sunday school,
                  perhaps."</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"To the Brick Church, then."</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"To the Mariner's Home."</p>
               <p>"No; the Mariner s Home gets two thousand dollars, though."</p>
               <p>"Then I cannot guess."</p>
               <p>"He leaves it to John Dent," said her guardian, with a curious smile, watching
                  Prudence narrowly as he spoke the words.</p>
               <p>"Is n't that rather singular?" said Prudence, without ruffling a feather.</p>
               <p>"She does n't care the snap of her finger for him, that is certain," was Mr.
                  Dent's internal comment.—"No, not singular. My brother Benjamin and Parson Hawkins
                  were close friends for many years. I believe Benjamin helped him in some money
                  affair when they were at college together, and his gratitude is not
                  unnatural,—assuming that gratitude is a great deal more common than it is. But the
                  injunction laid upon the executors—and I am one—<emph>is</emph> singular. The
                  executors are not to make public the contents of the will, and Jack is not to be
                  informed of his inheritance—provided we could find him—until a year after the
                  death of the testator."</p>
               <p>"What a strange provision!"</p>
               <p>"The parson explains it by saying that every man ought to earn his own living;
                  that sudden wealth is frequently the worst misfortune that can befall a young man,
                  and he wishes his friend's son to rely on his own exertions for a while 'in
                  order'—and these are the parson's very words—'that be may learn to estimate riches
                  at their proper value, and support prosperity without arrogance.' All of which
                     is<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5557-00000082"/> sensible enough, quite in the
                  style of your friend Dr. Johnson, but rather odd on the whole. Indeed, the will is
                  as angular as one of the parson's sermons. Jarvis drew it up, but he could not
                  have composed a sentence of it to save him. Any way, Jack falls heir to a round
                  sum,—about eighty thousand dollars, not including the house and lot in Horseshoe
                  Lane."</p>
               <p>"And perhaps at this moment he is without bread to eat, or a roof to shelter
                  him!"</p>
               <p>"Most likely. He has not condescended to let his friends know what he has done
                  with himself. But as you said long ago, it will be a great thing for him; it will
                  teach him self-reliance. I did n't think then he needed any lessons in that branch
                  of science; but I have altered my opinion. It was cowardly in Jack to strike his
                  colors at the first fire. I was mistaken and disappointed in him. I suppose it is
                  the fellow's pride that has kept him from writing to me."</p>
               <p>"I am sure something ought to be done about him now, uncle."</p>
               <p>"If I knew what to do. I could not tell him of Parson Hawkins's will, if he were
                  here. I don't imagine an advertisement in the papers would be a very tempting bait
                  to Jack. Letters have no effect on him, apparently. When I saw you so unhap— I
                  mean when we got the story of that rascally Nevins, I wrote Jack to come home and
                  take a fresh start; offered to organize a mining company, make him superintendent,
                  and go into the business in a rational manner; but he never answered my letter, if
                  he got it."</p>
               <p>"That was very generous of you," said Prudence, to whom this was news.</p>
               <p>"I don't like his silence. Why, it is two years and a half, going on three years.
                  Sometimes, you know, I fancy he has fallen in with that man, and come to harm. The
                  idea may have passed through the parson's mind also, which would account for the
                  surprising codicil he added to the will."</p>
               <p>The subject of the will and all connected with it was painful to Prudence, but she
                  was instantly curious to know what this surprising codicil was, and said so in
                  that involuntary language which belongs to expressive eyes.</p>
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5557-00000083"/>
               <p>Mr. Dent took up one of the solemn-looking documents and glanced at the last page,
                  then laid it down, then turned to it again, and reread a certain passage
                  deliberately, as if to assure himself before he spoke.</p>
               <p>"In case of John Dent's death," he said, "in case he dies within the twelve months
                  specified, the property comes to <emph>you</emph>."</p>
               <p>"No, no! it must never come to me!" cried Prudence, starting from the great
                  arm-chair in which she had curled herself. "He must be found; whether he is told
                  of it or not, he must be found!"</p>
               <p>"I think myself he ought to be looked up. It is ridiculous for him to be roughing
                  it out there,—wherever he is,—with all this money coming to him in a few months.
                  But it is not clear to me what can be done about it."</p>
               <p>"Cannot some one be sent to find him? Joseph Twombly, for instance?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Twombly might be sent; and get some buckshot in that other leg,—his luck. He
                  would go in a second if it was suggested; but Twombly has just secured a good
                  situation in Chicago,—did n't I mention it to you?— and I am not sure I should be
                  justified in asking him."</p>
               <p>Joseph Twombly, ex-knight and capitalist, had bowed gracefully and good-humoredly
                  to fate, instead of throwing up his hands and rending his garments, like other
                  people we know of. For many months after his return from El Dorado, the good
                  knight could get nothing to do, and in truth he was not capable of doing much, on
                  account of his wound. He lay idle around Rivermouth, to the no slight
                  embarrassment of Deacon Twombly, who was not prospering in a as worldly point of
                  view. Ewe-lambs had become chronic in the deacon's family, and he found himself
                  again banished, as the reader has been informed, to the spare room in the attic,
                  and a new lamb had come to be fed even before the little one of a previous season
                  was fairly upon its mottled legs. It was at this time,—two weeks before Parson
                  Hawkins's fatal stroke of paralysis, and while Mr. Dent was urging his friend
                  Dillingham to consider the Rivermouth proposal,—that a piece of sunny fortune fell
                  to the portion of Joseph Twombly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent was not a man who unbosomed<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5557-00000084"/>
                  himself to every chance acquaintance, but he had been particularly communicative
                  with Mr. Dillingham touching Rivermouth affairs, and had not left untold the
                  history, of his nephew's misfortunes. I am inclined to suspect, however, that Mr.
                  Dent restricted himself to the financial parts of the narrative, and said nothing
                  whatever of the trifling love-passage that had taken place between his ward and
                  John Dent. It would have been hardly fair to Prudence to speak of that; but he
                  talked frequently of his nephew, all the more frequently, perhaps, because the
                  subject was tabooed at home. It chanced one evening, as the two gentlemen were
                  chatting together in a private parlor at the Astor House, that the conversation
                  turned on Twombly.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid Joseph is a heavy burden to the deacon, just now," Mr. Dent said. "I
                  wish I could help the fellow; but every one is retrenching on account of the
                  troubles down South, and there seems to be no opening for Joseph."</p>
               <p>"He appears to be an estimable and faithful young person," Mr. Dillingham replied,
                  "and I should take it as a favor if I might be allowed to join you in any plan to
                  assist him. I have no business influence here, but I am confident that a word from
                  me to my Chicago bankers would secure interest for Mr. Twombly there. Suppose I
                  write to them?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham did write, and Messrs. Rawlings &amp; Sons were pleased to find a
                  place in their office for a young man so highly spoken of by their esteemed
                  correspondent. A few days afterwards Mr. Joseph Twombly, with a comfortable check
                  in his pocket, was on his way to Chicago.</p>
               <p>To recall him now, and send him on a wild-goose chase after John Dent, was a step
                  not to be taken without consideration, if at all.</p>
               <p>"He is out of the question at present. Perhaps by and by, if I fail to obtain any
                  clew to Jack's whereabouts, I may be forced to make use of Joseph. What was the
                  name of that banking firm at Salt Lake City which Jack mentioned in his letter?
                  Look it up, and I will write to those people."</p>
               <p>"It was Tileston &amp; Co.," replied Prudence, who had an excellent memory.</p>
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5557-00000085"/>
               <p>"And I'll write to Jack also at Red Rock,—the rock on which he split,"
                  supplemented Mr. Dent; but his little pleasantry fell cold. Prudence was not in a
                  mood to encourage jests, and Mr. Dent withdrew crestfallen into his serious shell.
                  "Perhaps it would be advisable to drop him a line at San Francisco," he said.
                  "What do you think?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent went to work on his letters, and Prudence stole off thoughtfully to the
                  small bay-window room over the hall door, where she always did her meditating.
                  This business of the will weighed heavily upon her. There was something chilling
                  in the reflection that perhaps the dead man had left his money to a dead man, and
                  it would thus fall to her,—an avalanche of clammy gold-pieces slipping through
                  dead men's fingers! She would touch none of it! The idea made her shiver.</p>
               <p>She was still sitting by the open casement, dismayed at the prospect, when Mr.
                  Dent stepped out of the door below, a valise in his hand, and his spring overcoat
                  thrown across one arm.</p>
               <p>Prudence drew back hastily, and when Mr. Dent looked up at the window, she was not
                  visible. The movement had been mechanical on her part, and she was instantly
                  ashamed of it. Of course it was perfectly proper that her guardian should meet the
                  Rev. Mr. Dillingham in Boston, and conduct him to Rivermouth; Mr. Dent was in a
                  manner bound to so much courtesy; but the thought of a stranger standing in the
                  dear old parson's pulpit brought the tears to Prudence's eyes.</p>
               <p>"It is very uncharitable and unchristian, I know," said Prudence, watching her
                  guardian's receding figure, "but I think I shall hate the new minister."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>RIVERMOUTH is a town where almost literally nothing happens.
                  Sometimes somebody is married, and sometimes somebody dies,—with surprising
                  abruptness, as the old parson did, for example,—and sometimes a vessel is blown on
                  the rocks at the mouth of the harbor. But of those salient tragedies and comedies
                  which make up the sum of life in cities, Rivermouth knows next to nothing. Since
                  the hanging of a witch or two in the pre-revolutionary days, the office of sheriff
                  there has been virtually a sinecure. The police-court—where now and then a
                  thoughtless, light-fingered person is admonished of the error of his ways, and the
                  one habitual drunkard is periodically despatched to the Town-Farm—seems almost
                  like a branch of the Sunday school. The community may be said to have lived for
                  thirty years on a single divorce case, growing out of the elopement of Major Tom
                  Deering with Mrs. Honoria Maddox,—to this day a perilous story <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"That matrons tell, with sharpened tongue,</l>
                        <l>To maids with downcast eyes."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In default of great events, small matters rise to the first magnitude in
                  Rivermouth. There are people there who can give you, if you chance to be to the
                  manner born, the most minute particulars of the career of your great-grandfather,
                  and to whom what you have for dinner is far from being an uninteresting item.</p>
               <p>"I see Capen Chris Bell at Seth Wiggins's this mornin'," says Mr. Uriah Stebbens
                  to Mr. Caleb Stokels; "he bought that great turkey of Seth's, and six poun's of
                  steak—right off the tenderline. Guess he expects his brother-in-law's family down
                  from Bostin. Capen Chris Bell always was a good provider."</p>
               <p>This piece of information lies like a live coal upon the brain of Mr. Stokels
                  until, with becoming gravity, he turns it over to some other inquiring neighbor.
                  At a moderate estimate, not less than two thirds of the entire population of
                  Rivermouth sit down in imagination at<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5557-00000087"/>
                  Captain Christopher Bell's dinner-table the next day.</p>
               <p>Unless the reader is familiar with the interior life of secluded New England towns
                  like Rivermouth, he will find it difficult to understand the excitement that
                  prevailed on the Sunday when the Rev. Mr. James Dillingham preached his first
                  sermon in the Old Brick Church. Yet even a stranger, passing through the streets,
                  crowded at; the earliest stroke of the bells,—I think there is no music this side
                  of heaven sweeter than the clangor of those same Rivermouth bells,—could not have
                  failed to notice an unwonted, eager looks on the faces of the neatly dressed
                  throng. There was something in the very atmosphere different from that of ordinary
                  days. A sort of pious Fourth-of-July halo diffused itself through the fleecy,
                  low-hanging clouds, which, with May-time capriciousness broke into fine rain
                  before the service was concluded. A circumstance in which uncle Jedd detected,
                  with microscopic eye, the marked disapproval of Providence.</p>
               <p>If such was the significance of the unheralded shower that drenched Rivermouth's
                  sprint-bonnets nets, and bedraggled alike the just and the unjust, it was, not so
                  accepted by the congregation of the Old Bricks Church.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Dillingham had achieved a signal triumph, and had triumphed in the
                  teeth of very serious obstacles. A small number of the parishioners had been
                  against him from the first, and the death of Parson Hawkins had not only
                  strengthened their opposition, but created a reaction among those who had insisted
                  most strenuously on the removal of the old minister. It so chanced, then, that,
                  Mr. Dillingham came to face as critical and unsympathetic a congregation as could
                  well be. Perhaps the only really impartial listeners among his audience were those
                  belonging to other parishes; for it was a noticeable fact that all the other
                  churches in town were nearly empty on this occasion. The Rev. Josiah Jones, who
                  had not spared himself in preparing his sermon for that forenoon, saw with
                  ill-concealed distaste that the larger portion of his flock had strayed into the
                  neighboring pasture.</p>
               <p>If Mr. Dillingham had had an intimation of the actual state of things, he would
                  perhaps not<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5557-00000088"/> have been so little
                  self-conscious and so entirely composed as be appeared; but happily he had no
                  suspicion of the unfriendly spirit that animated the majority of his hearers.</p>
               <p>With a slight flush on his cheeks, which faded out almost immediately, Mr.
                  Dillingham passed from the small room at the rear of the church, and ascended the
                  pulpit stairs,—a slim young man, nearly six feet in height, with gentle blue eyes,
                  and long hair of a dull gold color, which he wore brushed behind his ears. It was
                  not a remarkably strong face, Mr. Dillingham's, but it was not without character.
                  The firmly cut mouth and chin saved it, perhaps, from being effeminate. He was
                  twenty-nine or thirty, but did not look it; his closely shaved face and light
                  complexion gave him quite a youthful air, to one looking at him across the
                  church.</p>
               <p>"Why, he ain't nothin' but a boy," said Uncle Jedd to himself, regarding the new
                  minister critically for a moment from the vestibule. "<emph>He</emph> won't do."
                  And the ancient sexton gave a final tug at the bell-rope which be had retained in
                  his hand. While the reverberation of the silvery crash that followed was floating
                  above the house-tops and stealing away to die among the outlying hills, Uncle Jedd
                  softly closed the green-baize doors which opened upon the three aisles.</p>
               <p>A contagious ripple and flutter had passed over the congregation when Mr.
                  Dillingham ascended the pulpit steps and seated himself in the antique high-backed
                  chair at the left of the desk. This same flutter and ripple was duplicated as he
                  rose to open the service, which he did by repeating the Lord's Prayer in a clear,
                  melodious voice, making it seem a new thing to some who had only heard it droned
                  before. Quick, subtile glances, indicative of surprise and approval, were shot
                  from pew to pew. The old familiar hymn, too, as he read it, gathered fresh beauty
                  from his lips. A chapter from the Scriptures followed, in which Mr. Dillingham
                  touched the key-note of his sermon. There was a strange light come into the gentle
                  blue eyes now, and the serene, pale face that had seemed to promise so little was
                  alive with intelligence.</p>
               <p>By the time he had reached this portion of<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000089"/> the service, the young minister had taken more than
                  half of his listeners captive. The sermon itself completed the victory,—Mr. Seth
                  Wiggins and Uncle Jedd alone remaining unconquered, the former having dropped into
                  oblivious slumber after the first hymn, and the latter having retreated into the
                  belfry, where he had sat ruminative on a rafter, communing with the glossy pigeons
                  and ringdoves, until it was time for him to open the doors below.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wiggins awoke instinctively, with a jerk, for the benediction, and assumed
                  that half-deprecatory, half-defiant expression which marks the chronic delinquent;
                  and Uncle Jedd threw open the padded doors just at the critical instant, as if he
                  had been waiting there a century.</p>
               <p>As the people filed out of church, both these gentlemen were made aware that the
                  new minister had created a deep impression on the congregation. A drizzling warm
                  rain had begun to fall, as I have said, and groups of elderly ladies and pretty
                  girls, grasping their skirts with despairing clutches, stood about the vestibule
                  waiting for umbrellas to be brought.</p>
               <p>"A young man of uncommon talent," Mr. Lathers, the master of the Boys'
                  High-School, was heard to remark to Mr. Gargoyle, the retired plumber.</p>
               <p>"O, uncommon!" responded that gentleman.</p>
               <p>"I think he is just perfectly splendid," said Miss Imogen Browne, bringing her
                  creaseless lavender gloves together ecstatically.</p>
               <p>"So modest," said Miss Hesba Godfrey.</p>
               <p>"And such fine eyes," chimed Miss Amelia, the younger sister.</p>
               <p>"How lovely it was in him," remarked Miss Blydenburgh, composedly fastening her
                  bracelet, which had come unlinked, and giving it a little admonitory pat, "to
                  choose for his text the very verse which Parson Hawkins was reading when he
                  died,—'Thou good and faithful servant' etc., etc."</p>
               <p>"And how beautifully he spoke of Parson Hawkins," said young Mrs. Newbury, looking
                  distractingly cool and edible—something like celery—in her widows'-weeds. "I was
                  ready to cry."</p>
               <p>"I did."</p>
               <p>"What a spiritual face he has!" observed<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5557-00000090"
                  /> the elder Miss Trippew, who painted in watercolors; "it reminded me of our
                  Saviour's in the engraving of Leonardo da Vinci's 'Last Supper.'"</p>
               <p>"And what a delicious voice,—like Wendell Phillips's."</p>
               <p>"Then such a sermon! It is certainly an improvement on the poor old parson's
                  interminable ninthlies and finallies."</p>
               <p>"I wonder if he is married," said Miss Candace Woodman, a compact little person,
                  with almond-shaped brown eyes and glittering yellow ringlets which might have been
                  sent to the mint and cut up instantly into five-dollar gold-pieces.</p>
               <p>Miss Candace's remark cast a strange gloom for a moment over the group in which
                  she stood. Presently the umbrellas appeared; snowy skirts were daintily gathered
                  up; the vestibule was deserted; the voices melted away into the distance. Here and
                  there along the streets, darting to and fro in the rain like swallows, one might
                  have caught scores of such light-winged adjectives as enthusiastic young women let
                  loose when they give expression to their admiration.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," muttered Uncle Jedd, turning the key in the ponderous lock of the
                  church-door, "I dunno what th' world is a-comin' ter!"</p>
               <p>"And what do you think of Mr. Dillingham, Prue?" asked Mr. Dent, as the hoofs of
                  the horses struck on the slippery planks of the bridge leading from town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent had not even blinked that day in church. It had been noticed and
                  commented on by the local satirist, that that suspicious smooth place on the
                  wooden pillar intersecting the northwest corner of Mr. Dent's pew was not covered
                  once during the sermon. Mr. Dent himself had observed that "damnéd spot" for the
                  first time with remorse, and had secretly determined to have the interior of the
                  church repainted at his own expense.</p>
               <p>"I think," said Prudence, in reply to her guardian's question,—"I think he reads
                  well and speaks well."</p>
               <p>"Gad, I never heard anybody speak better, except one, and that was Daniel
                  Webster."</p>
               <p>"He is very handsome, and seems to be unconscious that he is conscious of it."</p>
               <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5557-00000091"/>
               <p>"I declare, Prue, you are too deep for me!"</p>
               <p>"Is n't he, and with good reason, just a little bit—you know—meekly
                  conceited?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all," said Mr. Dent. "I don't know a man with less conceit than
                  Dillingham. He is in earnest. He is going to be very much interested in his work
                  here, and will make his mark. I am only afraid we shall not be able to keep so
                  brilliant a fellow."</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"When he becomes known, some wealthy Boston or New York society will be sure to
                  make him tempting offers."</p>
               <p>"But if he is very much interested in his work here, he will not be tempted."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not. But the best of them like fat salaries," said Mr. Dent,
                  absently.</p>
               <p>Prudence pictured to herself Parson Wibird deserting the North Parish, or any
                  parish where he thought his duty lay, to accept a call from some richer
                  congregation; but she was not able to draw a distinct picture of it.</p>
               <p>"Then I suppose the fatter the salary is the deeper the interest they take in
                  their work?" Prudence remarked.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Mr. Dent, shortly.</p>
               <p>He felt that he had cast a reflection upon his friend Dillingham; he did not see
                  exactly how, and it annoyed him. The rest of the ride home was in silence.
                  Prudence, too, was not satisfied with herself. In intimating that she thought Mr.
                  Dillingham conceited, she had departed from her usual candor.</p>
               <p>Throughout the services his manner had been without a tinge of self-consciousness.
                  She had taken her seat in the pew rather sadly. To see a new minister standing in
                  the place hallowed so many years by the presence of Parson Wibird—it was only a
                  fortnight ago that he stood there, with his placid, venerable face—could but be
                  painful to her. The first few words Mr. Dillingham uttered had grated on her
                  heart; then she had yielded insensibly to the charm which had fallen upon most of
                  the congregation, and found herself listening to him with hushed breath. The
                  strains of the organ seemed to take up the prayer where he had paused; the tones
                  of his voice and the rich swell of the music blended and appeared to have one
                  meaning, like those frescos in which<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5557-00000092"/>
                  the same design repeats itself in different tints. She listened and listened, and
                  when Uncle Jedd suddenly threw open the muffled green doors, it was as if a spell
                  had been broken. O, glorious gift of speaking golden words with a golden
                  tongue!</p>
               <p>A sense of having been disloyal to the memory of the old parson was troubling
                  Prudence when Mr. Dent put his question, and she had not answered him fairly. It
                  was sins like that which Prudence would have had to confess if she had been a
                  Roman Catholic.</p>
               <p>She liked Mr. Dillingham more than she had believed it possible to like Parson
                  Wibird's successor; but the limitations of her character would not allow her to
                  acknowledge it upon compulsion. On leaving the church she felt in her heart that
                  she disliked Mr. Dillingham for having made her listen to him; and there shaped
                  itself in Prudence's mind an inexplicable wish,—often enough she thought of it
                  afterwards,—that he had never come to Rivermouth.</p>

               <head>XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">A NEW ENGLAND IDOL.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>ON the following Sunday the Rev. James Dillingham was formally
                  installed pastor of the Old Brick Church. The Rev. Josephus Starleigh delivered
                  the installation sermon (afterwards printed in pamphlet form at the request of the
                  parish), and Mr. Thomas Jefferson Greene, a young poet of local celebrity,
                  composed an original hymn for the occasion.</p>
               <p>So the mantle of Parson Wibird Hawkins fell upon the shoulders of the young
                  minister, and the solemn chant ascended, while the great guns were booming down
                  South.</p>
               <p>Those were the days—what ages ago they seem!—when the tap of the snare-drum and
                  the shrill treble of the fife startled New England from her dream, and awoke the
                  vengeful echoes which had been slumbering in the mountain fastnesses and among the
                  happy valleys for nearly half a century.</p>
               <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5557-00000093"/>
               <p>It had long ceased to be at Mr. Dillingham's option to return to South Carolina,
                  and he must have congratulated himself on having found so pleasant a haven as
                  Rivermouth to rest in until the simoon blew over. And certainly Rivermouth
                  congratulated itself on sheltering so brilliant a young divine. I happened to be
                  there at that period, recovering from a protracted illness, and I had the
                  privilege of witnessing a spectacle which is possible only in genteel decayed old
                  towns like that in which the scene of my story lies. To see one or two hundred
                  young New England vestals burning incense and strewing flowers before a slim young
                  gentleman in black is a spectacle worth witnessing once in the course of one's
                  life.</p>
               <p>The young man who, putting behind him the less spiritual rewards of other
                  professions, selects the ministry as the field of his labors—-drawn to his work by
                  the consciousness that it is there his duty points—is certain to impress us with
                  the purity of his purpose. That he should exert a stronger influence over our
                  minds than a young lawyer does, or a young merchant, or a young man in any
                  respectable spectable walk of life, is easily understood. But a young man, because
                  he buttons the top button of his coat and wears a white necktie, is not
                  necessarily a person of exalted purpose or shining ability. Yet he is apt, without
                  any very searching examination, to be so regarded in some of our provincial towns.
                  I think the straight-cut black coat must possess a subtile magnetism in itself,
                  something analogous to the glamour there is in the uniform of a young naval or
                  army officer. How else shall we explain the admiration which we have many a time
                  seen lavished on very inferior young men?</p>
               <p>I am not speaking in this vein of the Rev. James Dillingham. The secret of his
                  popularity was an open secret. It was his manly bearing and handsome face and
                  undeniable eloquence that made him a favorite at once in Rivermouth, and would
                  have commended him anywhere. If Mr. Dillingham turned the heads of all the young
                  women in the parish, he won the hearts of nearly all the elderly people also. I
                  think he would have done this by his amiability and talents, if he had not been
                  rich or<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5557-00000094"/> young or handsome. If he had
                  been married? Well, I cannot say about that. A young unmarried clergyman,
                  especially if he is rich, is likely to be well thought of in a sequestered valley
                  where there are a surplus of blooming Rachels and a paucity of available
                  Jacobs.</p>
               <p>From my point of view, it was something of an ordeal that Mr. Dillingham passed
                  through in those first three months. As much as I admired his sermons, and they
                  were above the average both in style and texture, I admired greatly more the
                  modest good sense which enabled him to keep his bark trim in those pleasant but
                  perilous waters. A vain man would have been wrecked in a week. But the Rev. Mr.
                  Dillingham, as Mr. Ralph Dent had declared, was without conceit of the small kind.
                  The attentions Mr. Dillingham received from all quarters would have gone far to
                  spoil eight men in ten placed in his position. It is so easy to add another story
                  to the high opinion which other people have of you.</p>
               <p>There were evening parties made for Mr. Dillingham at the Blydenburghs', the
                  Goldstones', and the Grimes's; there were picnics up the river, and excursions
                  down the harbor, and innumerable teaings on shore. I do not know if Mr. Dillingham
                  had a very strong sense of humor; but even if he were only mildly humorous, he
                  must have been amused as well as embarrassed by the number of embroidered slippers
                  and ingenious pen-wipers and study-caps and carved paper-cutters that fell to his
                  lot at the fair held about this time for the benefit of the foreign missions. If
                  he had been a centipede he could not have worn out the slippers under four years,
                  wearing them day and night; if he had been a hydra he could not have made head
                  against the study-caps in a lifetime. Briareus would have lacked hands to hold the
                  paper-cutters. The slippers overran Mr. Dillingham's bedroom like the swarms of
                  locusts that settled upon Egypt. The pen-wipers made his study-table look like a
                  bed of variegated dahlias.</p>
               <p>There were other expressions of regard, less material and tangible than these, to
                  be sure, but which must have been infinitely harder to dispose of. There were
                  sudden droopings of eyelashes, black or golden, when he spoke;<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000095"/> furtive glances of shyness or reverence;
                  half-parted lips, indicating that breathless interest which is the very cream of
                  compliment, and flies to the head like wine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham moved gracefully and serenely among the shoals and quicksands; he
                  listened to the songs of the sirens, and passed on. He did not, however, accept
                  the flattery as if it were only his due; he accepted it modestly, and was simply
                  natural, and candid, and good-natured, like a man who finds himself among friends.
                  "I see how it is," he once remarked to Mr. Dent, "I am standing in the sunshine
                  created by my predecessor." It was no glory of his own; he was fortunate in
                  falling among a people who took kindly to their minister.</p>
               <p>If Mr. Dillingham had been blind, he might have seen that he could have his choice
                  of Rivermouth's belles; and he was far from sightless. He read women and men very
                  well in his quiet fashion. Clearly, he was in no haste to be fettered. What a
                  crowd of keen, fair slave-merchants would have flocked down to the market-place,
                  if this slender, blond prince from Southland had been chained by the ankle to one
                  of the stalls, to be knocked down by Mr. Wiggins to the highest bidder!</p>
               <p>Miss Veronica Blydenburgh, who passed her winters in New York and Baltimore, and
                  had flirted in a high-spirited way with various professions, became suddenly
                  pensive. Hesba Godfrey candidly owned that she had fallen in love with Mr.
                  Dillingham before he got half-way up the pulpit stairs the first Sunday, but that
                  Fred Shelborne refused to release her, and she supposed she should be obliged to
                  marry Fred,—just to keep him quiet. Young Mrs. Newbury in her widows'-weeds, like
                  a diamond set in jet, seemed to grow lovelier day by day. In my own mind I put the
                  widow down as dangerous. Not that I had any reason for so doing. Mr. Dillingham
                  smiled upon her with precisely the same smile he gave to the Widow Mugridge. There
                  was not a shade of difference perceptible between his manner to the elder Miss
                  Trippew, a remarkably plain lamb, and his manner to Miss Veronica of the golden
                  fleece. I said it before, and I say again, I admired the way he carried himself
                  through all this.</p>
               <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5557-00000096"/>
               <p>When Mr. Dillingham, the morning following his initial sermon, signified to the
                  deacons his acceptance of the pastorate of the Old Brick Church, a knotty question
                  arose as to the residence of the new minister. There was no parsonage attached to
                  the church; the cottage which Parson Hawkins had occupied so many years did not
                  belong to the society; besides, if there had been a parsonage, Mr. Dillingham had
                  no family, and the absurdity of his going to housekeeping without a family was
                  obvious. The three or four private boarding-places suggested to him failed to meet
                  his views. Deacon Twombly, who saw the advantage of having a lucrative boarder,
                  hinted at his first-floor as furnishing desirable accommodation; but the ewe-lamb
                  was brought up as an objection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham, who was staying at the Bell Tavern, the only hotel in town,—having
                  declined Mr. Dent's offer of hospitality,—cut the Gordian knot by deciding to
                  remain where he was.</p>
               <p>This gave a sensible shock to some of the congregation, for it seemed scarcely
                  proper for the pastor of the Old Brick Church to live at a hotel. Deacon Wendell
                  adroitly intimated as much to Mr. Dillingham, who replied that he did not see why
                  it was proper for him to remain six days at the hotel, as he had done, if it was
                  improper for him to remain there six months, or six years. Propriety was not a
                  question of time. The house was quiet, his rooms commodious and comfortable, and
                  he did not see how he could do better. He invited Deacon Wendell to dinner, and no
                  further objections were heard of.</p>
               <p>In the first bloom of his popularity Mr. Dillingham could have done pretty much as
                  he pleased, and he did.</p>
               <p>Among other innovations, he brought sunshine into the Old Brick Church. Parson
                  Hawkins had been a good man, a saint, indeed; but his saintliness had been of the
                  sombre sort; listening to some of his doctrinal sermons, one might have applied to
                  him that epigram of Landor's,— <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Fear God!" says Percival; and when you hear</l>
                        <l>Tones so lugubrious, you perforce must fear:</l>
                        <l>If in such awful accents he should say,</l>
                        <l>"Fear lovely Innocence!" you'd run away!</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC5557-00000097"/>
               <p>That early Puritan taint which sometimes appeared in Parson Hawkins's theology,
                  but never in his daily life, was an alien thing to Mr. Dillingham in or out of the
                  pulpit. The spirit of his teaching was eminently a cheerful spirit.</p>
               <p>There was a new order of things in the North Parish. The late parson had stood a
                  great deal of browbeating first and last. A conservative man, leaning perhaps a
                  little too heavily on the pillars of the church, he had ever consulted the
                  inclination of the deacons. They had an independent minister now; a parson who
                  settled questions for himself, and did not embarrass his mind by loading it with
                  outside opinions. There was a spice of novelty in this surprisingly agreeable to
                  the palate of a community long accustomed to domineer over its pastor. How long
                  will it last? I used to wonder. I had seen so many idols set up reverently, and
                  bowled over ruthlessly, that I was slightly sceptical as to the duration of Mr.
                  Dillingham's popularity. If the towns-people were image-worshippers, they were
                  iconoclasts also, when the mood was on them. But Mr. Dillingham's lingham's
                  popularity did not wane during my three months' stay in Rivermouth; it went on
                  steadily increasing. The war-fever was at its height in those months; and the
                  loyalty of Mr. Dillingham, a Southerner, stood out in striking contrast with the
                  mild patriotism of several of our native-born statesmen. When his first quarter's
                  salary fell due, Mr. Dillingham set the seal to public favor by turning over the
                  amount to the fund for the Soldiers' Hospital. Uncle Jedd himself, one of the last
                  in the parish that held out against the new minister, was obliged to admit that
                  this was very handsome in the young man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham had not been three weeks in Rivermouth before he knew all the queer
                  old men and women in the place, and stood in their good graces. Even the one
                  habitual drunkard, when he was not hiding the light of his countenance at the
                  Town-Farm, would touch his battered hat convulsively, meeting the young parson on
                  the street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham was gifted in a high degree with the genius for knowing people, and
                  displayed consummate tact in his dealings with<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000098"/> the poor of the parish. When he made the Widow
                  Pepperell and the Clemmer boys his pensioners, he did it so delicately that the
                  obligation seemed on his side. "The parson's smile," said Sandy Marden, "jest
                  doubles what he gives a feller." Jeremiah Bowditch, the unfortunate inebriate
                  mentioned,—a shy, morbid man, and as sensitive as an exposed nerve,—was not afraid
                  to apply to the parson for a dollar, having discovered that the coin would not be
                  dropped upon him from such a moral height as to knock the breath out of his body
                  and wound all his finer feelings.</p>
               <p>"What I like in Dillingham," said the Hon. Sam Knubley, democratic member of the
                  General Court, "is that there is n't any 'first-family' nonsense about him. You
                  can see with half an eye that he belongs to the Southern aristocracy, but he is
                  n't eternally shinning up his genealogical tree. There's old Blydenburgh, who is
                  always perching himself on the upper branches and hurling down the cocoa-nuts of
                  his ancestors at common folks."</p>
               <p>It is not to be supposed that the Hon. Sam Knubley himself would have objected to
                  a few brilliant ancestors. To have the right to fall in at the end of a long queue
                  of men and women distinguished in their day and generation, is a privilege which
                  none but a simpleton would undervalue. It is a privilege, however, which often has
                  its drawbacks. Much is expected of a man whose progenitors have been central
                  figures. To inherit the great name without the great gifts is a piece of ironical
                  good fortune. When one's ancestors have been everything, and one's self is
                  nothing, it is perhaps just as well not to demand from the world the same degree
                  of consideration that was given voluntarily to one's predecessors. I have
                  encountered two or three young gentlemen in the capital of the Commonwealth of
                  Massachusetts who seemed to have the idea that <emph>they</emph> were killed at
                  the battle of Bunker Hill. It was possibly this sort of assumption that displeased
                  the Hon. Sam Knubley; if so, the Hon. Sam Knubley was quite right in the
                  matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent witnessed with pride the success of his young friend; and Prudence, who,
                  by the way, had naturally seen a great deal of<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000099"/> Mr. Dillingham meanwhile, began to take herself to
                  task for her cold demeanor towards him.</p>
               <p>If the truth must be told, she had been far from cordial to Mr. Dillingham. Now,
                  it is as mortifying to have one's lack of cordiality unnoticed as it is to have
                  one's warmth overlooked. Mr. Dillingham had apparently not observed that Miss
                  Palfrey had treated him with haughtiness. If she had been the Widow Mugridge, he
                  could not have smiled upon her more benignly, or listened to her more attentively,
                  when she was pleased to address him. The offence to her self-love was so subtile
                  that Prudence was never able to account for the restless and half-provoked mood
                  which, up to this time, had always possessed her in his presence.</p>
               <p>"The fact is," Prudence soliloquized one evening when the young clergyman had
                  taken tea at Willowbrook, "I have an unamiable disposition; Uncle Ralph has
                  spoiled me by humoring me. I must discipline myself, and I'll begin by treating
                  Mr. Dillingham with a little politeness, if his royal highness will allow it. I
                  always feel as if he stepped down from a throne to converse with me. In spite of
                  his smile and deference, when one is speaking, there's something depressing and
                  condescending in his air. If King Cophetua was the least like that, I wonder the
                  beggar-maid had anything to do with him."</p>
               <p>It was, by the way, Miss Veronica Blydenburgh who had christened him King
                  Cophetua.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>THOUGH the Rev. Mr. Dillingham had too much diplomacy to stroke one
                  lamb on the head more tenderly than another, and so throw the whole flock into
                  confusion, he made no secret of his preference for Mr. Dent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham passed most of his leisure hours at Willowbrook. Since his
                  installation, he had taken tea there every Sunday evening. When Mr. Dent went to
                  town, which was three or four times a week, he always dropped into his friend's
                  study, and frequently Mr. Dillingham rode home with him and remained to dinner.
                  There was a well-stocked fish-pond a few miles beyond Willowbrook; both gentlemen
                  were expert anglers, and they spent their mornings together in the season. Then
                  there were horseback rides, in which Prudence occasionally joined. Mr. Dillingham
                  had purchased a fine animal, which he rode admirably.</p>
               <p>"We all ride in the South," he said to Miss Palfrey. "The people in the town stare
                  at me as if I were a part of a circus caravan, but I trust they will get
                  accustomed to the sight. A saddle-horse is a necessity to me; I have had one since
                  I was six years old. To drive around in a gig with side-lanterns, like great
                  goggles, as that good soul Dr. Tredick does, would kill me. I should never get out
                  alive so far as Willowbrook, Miss Palfrey. I'd much prefer being brought here in
                  Mr. Plunket's hand-cart."</p>
               <p>Plunket was a harmless, half-witted old fellow about town who picked up a living
                  by carrying packages in a small hand-cart as aged and shattered as himself. He had
                  not escaped Mr. Dillingham, whose eye for every sort of eccentric character was,
                  as I have said, exceptionally keen.</p>
               <p>The friendship between Mr. Dillingham and Mr. Dent deepened as the weeks passed,
                  and the latter gentleman experienced something like a sinking at heart whenever
                  his thought recurred to the possibility that his young friend might be tempted
                  some time or other to desert<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5557-00000101"/> Rivermouth
                  for a more extended field of operation.</p>
               <p>"I wish to heaven, Dillingham," exclaimed Mr. Dent one evening at the tea-table,
                  "that you would give up your apartments in town, and come out here with us.
                  There's a cosey room leading from the south chamber that would make a capital
                  study for you."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid I should find it too pleasant," returned Mr. Dillingham, "and fall
                  into a habit of not working. Besides, my parish calls? I am very sensible of your
                  kindness, my friend; but, really, I think I am better off in my present quarters.
                  You see, two sermons a week keep me pretty busy. Then I am not a lark as regards
                  early rising. I should be a dreadful infliction in a private house. All Miss
                  Palfrey's methodical domestic laws would be overthrown at once."</p>
               <p>"I'd like to be an eyewitness to that," Mr. Dent said, laughing; "her law is as
                  the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. Prue is a regular martinet
                  in the commissary department."</p>
               <p>"I really am," spoke Prudence for herself. "If one is not down in time, one gets a
                  cold breakfast."</p>
               <p>"There, you see," said Mr. Dillingham. "Now there are two things I never can do; I
                  cannot endure a cold breakfast, and I never can get down early to a warm one."</p>
               <p>In spite of this obstacle, however, Mr. Dillingham often occupied that spare room
                  with the southern exposure, which Mr. Dent had mentioned, sometimes spending
                  several days in succession with his Willowbrook friends. Then they met him
                  continually in society in town, and in point of fact saw as much of him as if he
                  had accepted Mr. Dent's proposition.</p>
               <p>This intimacy could not fail to give rise to remarks. It was soon whispered, and
                  not too softly, that the young minister was paying attentions to Mr. Dent's ward.
                  Now, though Prudence's coldness had moderated somewhat, and she no longer had to
                  make exertions to be polite to Mr. Dillingham, Mr. Dillingham had not in the least
                  changed his manner to her. She was aware, and the reflection sometimes piqued her,
                  that she was no better acquainted with him after months of intercourse<pb
                     n="198-199" xml:id="VAC5557-00000102"/> than she was on the day she first saw
                  him. Perhaps it was her own fault they were not warmer friends in the beginning;
                  but it was not her fault now. She had learned to respect his character, to admire
                  his intellect, and to derive a quiet pleasure from his presence; but she had
                  evidently not taught him to like her more than he had liked her at the start. This
                  was not flattering under the circumstances. The inference was, Mr. Dillingham
                  disliked her, and tolerated her only on account of his friendship for Mr.
                  Dent.</p>
               <p>Prudence secretly resented this, and formed a misty idea that it would be an
                  agreeable thing to have him fall slightly in love with her, not seriously in love,
                  but just enough to enable her to teach him a lesson. This idea, in no respect a
                  commendable one, took a more definite shape, and became almost a wish
                  subsequently. Nice young women are not to be treated cavalierly with impunity.</p>
               <p>It was rumored at first that Mr. Dillingham was very much interested in Miss
                  Palfrey; that was sufficiently annoying; but later on, rumor changed its tactics,
                  and reported that Miss Palfrey was very much interested in Mr. Dillingham. Gossip,
                  like Providence, is inscrutable in its ways; it has its laws, we may suppose,
                  clearly defined, if one could get at them; but they are not to be reached by
                  inductive reasoning, and it must remain a mystery how it came to be believed in
                  Rivermouth that Prudence was very unhappy in consequence of her unreturned love
                  for Mr. Dillingham.</p>
               <p>To say that she did not hear of this exasperating story as soon as it was born,
                  would be to say that Prudence had no intimate female friend, and there was Miss
                  Veronica Blydenburgh.</p>
               <p>"And there is n't the least shadow of truth in it, Prue?" said Veronica.</p>
               <p>"Not the faintest. How absurd! I don't care that for him," said Prudence,
                  measuring off an infinitesimal portion of her little finger's tip, "nor he for me.
                  He and Uncle Ralph talk fish-hooks and theology and war, and I don't believe Mr.
                  Dillingham has noticed whether I am sixteen or sixty."</p>
               <p>"Dear me," said Veronica, thoughtfully.</p>
               <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC5557-00000103"/>
               <p>"Mortifying, is n't it?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure it is."</p>
               <p>"I like him, of course," continued Prudence; "he is extremely agreeable, and all
                  that. If there was, or could be, anything more, I should be the first to tell
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Dear me," repeated Veronica. "And it came so straight from the Goldstones, you
                  know." And Veronica, who had put her interrogation rather solemnly, became
                  unnecessarily merry over the absurdity of the thing.</p>
               <p>"The Goldstones?" said Prue. "I am very grateful to them!"</p>
               <p>After they had parted, Prudence thought of the abrupt change of mood in her
                  friend, and it brought her to a full stop in the middle of the bridge, for
                  Prudence was walking in from Rivermouth. Then she recalled a trivial incident that
                  had taken place a few nights before in town, at a party at the Blydenburghs'. It
                  had made no impression on her at the time, but now she recalled it. Veronica had
                  missed her bracelet late in the evening, a valuable bracelet, a large opal with
                  diamonds. She had been in the garden; she had danced in the parlors; and had gone
                  twice to the supper-room. The bracelet was not to be found in the house, and
                  Veronica with several of the guests, among others Prudence and Mr. Dillingham,
                  went into the garden to search for it in a certain arbor where ices had been
                  served. There were a score or two of Chinese lanterns hung about the trellis-work,
                  and the place was as light as day. In bending over the sward Mr. Dillingham had
                  inadvertently brushed against Veronica's shoulder,—that snowy shoulder which had
                  such an innocent arch way of shrinking from the corsage,—and Veronica had started
                  back with a pretty cry, blushing absurdly. Mr. Dillingham had been disconcerted
                  for an instant, then he had bowed in a formal way to Veronica.</p>
               <p>This little scene came up before Prudence's eyes again, and she walked on in a
                  revery.</p>
               <p>"It would be a very good match, though," said Prudence, thinking aloud.</p>
               <p>The piece of gossip which Miss Blydenburgh had unfolded to her friend vexed that
                  young lady exceedingly. The other rumor, placing Mr. Dillingham at her feet, had
                  vexed her too;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5557-00000104"/> but that could have been
                  borne. It sank into insignificance beside this new version, in which she was made
                  to play the heroine with dishevelled hair and unrequited affections,—a <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">rôle</foreign> to which she was not kindly disposed; for
                  Prudence was as proud as Mrs. Lucifer, if I may make the comparison without
                  assuming the responsibility of creating the personage.</p>
               <p>Prudence's prompt impulse was to fall back on her former frosty manner towards Mr.
                  Dillingham; but that was hardly practicable now; besides, the Rivermouth censors
                  would be sure to misconstrue her indifference and attribute it to wounded
                  vanity.</p>
               <p>Her wisest course was to treat Mr. Dillingham naturally, and let the shameless
                  scandal die of its own inanity. He would never hear the silly report; there was no
                  one who would venture to touch on so delicate a matter with him. Even the Widow
                  Mugridge, who was capable of almost anything in that line, might be pictured as
                  shrinking before such an attempt; for though Mr. Dillingham was as generally
                  affable and approachable as the sunshine, his familiarity did not breed contempt.
                  In the sea of adulation that dimpled around him, there was a gentle under-tow of
                  wholesome respect. The young clergyman's independence and sharpness, when called
                  for, were, quite well understood in the parish. He had wit, but no humor; and the
                  difference between wit and humor, it seems to me, is just the difference between
                  an open and a shut penknife. So there was no chance of anybody coming to him with
                  tittle-tattle, especially, about Miss Palfrey.</p>
               <p>Having settled this in her mind, Prudence calmed; but the gossip still rankled in
                  her bosom, and she felt it would be a most satisfying; vindication and triumph if
                  Mr. Dillingham would only fall in love with her mildly, and afford her the
                  opportunity of proving that she did not care for him, in that way.</p>
               <p>In other ways she cared for him greatly. Indeed, she had a strong desire for his
                  friendship. Every one had always liked her; she had never been courteously snubbed
                  before, or snubbed at all, and had no taste for it. The hurt went deeper than her
                  vanity. It was a shocking novelty to encounter a person—a person whom she
                  esteemed, too—whose whole demeanor said to<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000105"/> her as plainly as words, but politely, of course:
                  "Miss Palfrey, when you laugh, and, say sharp things to me, I smile upon you; when
                  you are demure and repentant and inclined to be friendly, I smile upon you all the
                  same; for, really, I do not care whether you are amiable or unamiable. It is a
                  matter that concerns you, and you alone."</p>
               <p>If Mr. Dillingham had studied Prudence from her infancy, and had wished to win her
                  regard, he could not have proceeded more judiciously. It is true, John Dent did
                  not win her by this method; but she was younger then, and maybe off her guard.
                  Perhaps if John Dent had had it to do over again, he might not have found it so
                  easy. What is efficacious at seventeen or eighteen is by no means certain of
                  success at twenty-one.</p>
               <p>Prudence did not think often of John Dent at this epoch. The phantom that had
                  haunted her so long had somehow withdrawn itself. For four of five months now she
                  had breathed with a conscious sense of freedom from the past. Mr. Dent's letters
                  to Montana and California had brought no response, and the subject ject of the
                  will was one that could well he in abeyance. Nothing could be done about it, and
                  it was not agreeable to talk or think about.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent observed with pleasure Prudence's growing appreciation of Mr. Dillingham,
                  and had some views which he cautiously kept to himself. Nothing would have
                  delighted him more than to see Prue well married now, however much the idea of
                  losing her had distracted him two or three years before; but he was not going to
                  interfere. He had once come near making her very unhappy, and had learned to
                  distrust his own sagacity in matters of the heart. He purposed in the present case
                  to let things take their own course.</p>
               <p>Things were taking their course, perhaps a little lazily, but only the whole to
                  his satisfaction. Prudence was never so lovely or sweet-tempered, and Mr. Dent
                  wondered time and again that Dillingham did not see more clearly than he seemed to
                  see that Prudence was a very charming young person. Mr. Dillingham held the
                  stirrup for her to mount Jenny, he folded her shawl neatly under the
                  carriage-seat, and was remiss in none of those attentions<pb n="206-207"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000106"/> which a well-bred man pays to a lady, young or old;
                  but in everything he did or said there was an air of having been introduced to
                  Miss Palfrey yesterday. To be sure, he had once or twice addressed her as "Miss
                  Prudence," instead of Miss Palfrey, striking her speechless with astonishment; but
                  then he had corrected himself in the same breath.</p>
               <p>"Why in the deuce does n't he call her Prue, like everybody else?" muttered Mr.
                  Dent. "He has known her five months intimately, and Jack called her Prue after
                  fifteen minutes' acquaintance. But that was Jack all over."</p>
               <p>The autumn of this year was unprecedentedly lovely,—it was one prolonged Indian
                  summer,—and horseback rides early in the morning were the chief diversion at
                  Willowbrook, where Mr. Dillingham frequently remained overnight to accompany Mr.
                  Dent and his ward. If Mr. Dillingham had a constitutional objection to
                  breakfasting with the larks, he had none whatever to rising at five o'clock to
                  take a four-mile gallop along the Rivermouth lanes, now wonderful with their
                  brilliant foliage. Prudence was an excellent horse-woman, and never lagged behind
                  her comrades. <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"As she fled fast through sun and shade</l>
                        <l>The happy winds upon her played,</l>
                        <l>Blowing the ringlet from the braid."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham must have been a stupid fellow if he did not notice how this
                  autumnal weather heightened Prue's beauty. She had caught a trick of color from
                  nature, and made the rosy maple-leaves by the roadside seem tame in tint compared
                  with her rich lips and cheeks.</p>
               <p>On one of these excursions Mr. Dent was unlucky enough to sprain his ankle, and
                  the rides came to an end, at least Mr. Dent's did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham, who came often now to read and chat with his friend, rode alone
                  several mornings, and then, rather to the surprise of Prudence, invited her to
                  bear him company.</p>
               <p>"Would it be proper for me to go, uncle?" asked Prudence, standing with drooped
                  eyelids by Mr. Dent's lounge.</p>
               <p>"Would it be proper!" he echoed. "Why, the female population of Rivermouth would
                  turn out in a body, and Dillingham would certainly<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000107"/> meet the fate of old Floyd Ireson, who, as you
                  remember, was 'tarred and feathered and carried in a cart by the women of
                  Marblehead'!"</p>
               <p>"Very well, then," cried Prue, gayly, "I'll ride Kate instead of Jenny. Jenny
                  pokes along so, and Mr. Dillingham likes a rapid pace."</p>
               <p>"'Pokes along so!' what a phrase from a young lady's lips!" said Mr. Dent,
                  critically.</p>
               <p>"I said polks," cried Prue, shamelessly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham unbent a little that morning. Being in some sense a host, he was
                  constrained to look after the entertainment of his guest and render himself
                  agreeable. The ride was without incident, save its uninterrupted pleasantness, and
                  Prudence returned with her cheeks in bloom and her gray eyes with the daybreak in
                  them.</p>
               <p>Three or four days afterwards the young minister rode up to the gate just before
                  sundown, and asked if Miss Palfrey would repeat her gallop. He had discovered a
                  road leading to some old earthworks overlooking the harbor, where the sunset was a
                  thing to see. Kate was saddled, and the two young people went off in a cloud of
                  dust, Mr. Dent leaning on a cane at the drawing-room window and smiling on them
                  like an amiable Fate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent's sprained ankle was a phenomenal case, and I am strongly tempted to
                  prepare an elaborate paper on the subject for the pages of the "Boston Medical and
                  Surgical Gazette." At the time of the accident—he turned his foot in the stirrup
                  while dismounting—it was thought serious enough to merit Dr. Tredick's attention,
                  who relieved Prudence's solicitude by treating the injury lightly. But the
                  weakened limb did not recover its strength, even after a course of arnica bandages
                  that ought to have caused a new leg to grow, or at least to have mended the old
                  one though it had been fractured in twenty places.</p>
               <p>The ankle did not get well, and science in the person of Dr. Tredick was at a loss
                  to explain why, and more especially to explain why it should be most troublesome
                  in the afternoons. Mr. Dent was able in the morning to walk on the piazza or go
                  about the house without excessive inconvenience; but towards three or four
                  o'clock, at which hour Mr. Dillingham<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5557-00000108"/>
                  generally appeared to inquire after the invalid, Mr. Dent found it necessary to
                  take to the lounge in the parlor, or to sit with his foot supported by another
                  chair.</p>
               <p>"Don't mind me, Dillingham," Mr. Dent said one day, with touching cheerfulness. "I
                  shall be all right after a while. I miss our rides confoundedly, and I know you
                  detest riding alone. However, there's Prue; she's better than nobody."</p>
               <p>"O, you flatter me!" says Prue.</p>
               <p>"I fear I have already drawn heavily on Miss Prudence's complaisance," replied Mr.
                  Dillingham. He did not correct himself this time. But Prudence was passionately
                  fond of riding, and to ride with Mr. Dillingham was like waltzing with a good
                  partner. She did not require other incitive. So it came about, owing to Mr. Dent's
                  slow recovery, that she often accompanied the young minister alone, not caring
                  greatly now what people said. She was doing nothing wrong, and the innocent
                  enjoyment was an offset to any malicious criticism.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham had thawed perceptibly, and in a stately style was very gracious to
                  her. Prudence's passing desire to have him love her a little had evaporated; she
                  was content with his friendship. The severest precision could have discovered
                  nothing to cavil at in Prudence's conduct. As in the old time she had not flirted
                  with John Dent, so in the new she did not flirt with Mr. Dillingham. She made no
                  eyes at him, as Mr. Dent would have stated it, and would have stated it
                  regretfully.</p>
               <p>There was not much conversation during these horseback excursions, which usually
                  had the fort for destination; a swift gallop through the bracing autumn air, a
                  halt in the lonely redoubt to breathe the horses and see the sunset, and a dashing
                  gait homeward, being the ends in view.</p>
               <p>It was a charming landscape which unrolled itself, like a colored map, at the foot
                  of the precipitous hill crowned by the deserted earthworks. First came a series of
                  cultivated fields, orchards, and gardens, nestled among which, were red-roofed
                  barns and comfortable white farm-houses, with striped chimneys, peering through
                  the leafless tree-tops. Then came the river spanned by a many-arched bridge,
                     linking<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5557-00000109"/> the picturesque town with
                  the open country. Here and there along the wharves the slender masts of
                  fishing-smacks shot up sharply. The clusters of round islands in the harbor were
                  like emeralds set in turquois, for the water at this point, at certain seasons, is
                  of a singularly opaque blue. Beyond the town lay the bright salt marshes softly
                  folded in an azure arm of the sea. All this, in the glow of the declining sun, was
                  fair to look upon.</p>
               <p>One November afternoon, in the middle of the month, Prudence and Mr. Dillingham
                  drew rein within the parade-ground of the old fortification just as the sun was
                  sinking. The embrasure at which they halted formed the frame of a fairy picture in
                  which sea and sky and meadow were taking a hundred opaline tints from the
                  reflection of the sunset. While the horses stood champing the bits, and panting,
                  the two riders let the reins slip idly from their fingers, and sat watching the
                  scene in silence.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes the vivid colors faded out of the sky, save at the horizon, where
                  a strip of angry scarlet still lingered, leaving the landscape of a soft pearly
                  gray. By and by the strip of scarlet melted into cinnabar, then into faint gold,
                  then into silver, then into indistinguishable ashes-of-roses like the rest, and
                  the early twilight stretched across land and sea.</p>
               <p>"It is like a dream, is n't it?" murmured Prue to herself, for at the instant she
                  had forgotten the presence of her companion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham leaned forward without speaking, and laid his hand lightly on
                  Prudence's, which rested ungloved on the black mane of the mare.</p>
               <p>The girl lifted her eyes with a swift movement to the face of the young minister,
                  and then very slowly withdrew her hand.</p>
               <p>"Prue!" said Mr. Dillingham, softly.</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>MR. JOSEPH TWOMBLY was sitting on a high stool at a desk in the
                  counting-room of Messrs. Rawlings &amp; Sons, the Chicago bankers. It was after
                  bank hours, and the office was deserted. The gray-haired head bookkeeper, and the
                  spruce young clerks who occupied the adjoining desks, had been gone an hour or
                  more. The monotonous ticking of the chronometer, pinioned against the wall above
                  the massive iron safe, was the only sound that broke the quiet of the room, except
                  when Twombly made an impatient movement with one of his feet on the attenuated
                  rungs of the stool, or drummed abstractedly with his fingers on the edge of the
                  desk.</p>
               <p>An open letter lay before him, and beside it an envelope bearing a Shasta postmark
                  and addressed to Joseph Twombly at Rivermouth. This letter had just come to him
                  inclosed in one of the deacon's, and was to this effect:—</p>

                              <salute>MY DEAR JOE:—</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>You will probably be surprised to receive a letter from me after all
                              these months of silence,—or, rather, years, for it is nearly three
                              years, is n't it, since we parted? I have been in no mood or condition
                              to write before, and I write now only because I may not have another
                              chance to relieve you of any uncertainty you may feel on my account. I
                              have thought it my duty to do this since I came to the resolve, within
                              a few days, to give up my hopeless pursuits here and go into the army.
                              If you do not hear from me or of me in the course of four or six
                              months, you will know that my bad luck, which began in Montana, has
                              culminated somewhere in the South. Then you can show this to my Uncle
                              Dent, or even before, if you wish; I leave it to your discretion.
                              Perhaps I shall do something in the war; who knows? It is time for me
                              to do something. I am a failure up to date. I'm not sure I am a brave
                              man, but I have that disregard for life which well fits me to lead
                              forlorn-hopes,—and I've led many a forlorn-hope these past three
                              years, Joe.</p>
                           <p>Ever since the day we said good by at Red Rock,<pb n="216-217"
                                 xml:id="VAC5557-00000111"/> I have been on the go. I have not
                              stayed more than a month in any one spot, except this last half-year
                              at a ranch in the neighborhood of Shasta, where I went into the
                              stock-raising business with another man (who did n't know I was the
                              spirit of Jonah revisiting the earth), and would have made my fortune
                              if the cattle-disease had not got into the herd just as we were on the
                              point of selling out at great profit. I was not aware that I had the
                              cattle-disease myself, but I fancy I must have given it to the
                              herd.</p>
                           <p>What had I been doing all the rest of the time?—for it took me only
                              six months to ruin my friend the stock-raiser. I had been searching
                              for George Nevins, Joe Twombly!</p>
                           <p>What a story I could tell you, if I had the heart and the patience to
                              go over it all again! How I first heard of him in California, where I
                              tracked him from place to place, sometimes only an hour or so behind
                              him; once I entered a mining-camp just as he went out the other side,
                              confound his cleverness!—how I followed him to Texas, and thence to
                              Montana again, and from there to Mexico, where I lost trace of him;
                              what I suffered mentally and physically in those mad hunts would not
                              be believed if I could write it out!—how I worked my way from town to
                              town, and from camp to camp, only halting here and there to earn a few
                              dollars to help me on. Hunger, thirst, cold, and heat, I have known
                              them all, Joe, as few men have known them. Shall I tell you—and that
                              is the strangest thing! what took the life out of me more than the
                              poverty and the treachery and the rest? It was the conviction that
                              that man, though I could not put my hand on <emph>him</emph>, had his
                              eye on me all the while,—the certainty that I never went to sleep
                              without his knowing where I lay down, that I never got up but he was
                              advised of my next move, that I was under his espionage day and
                              night!</p>
                           <p>I think my steps were dogged from the time I first left Montana,
                              though I had no suspicion of it until long after. The suspicion fired
                              me and gave me strength, in the beginning, and then it paralyzed me,
                              when I saw how easily he eluded my pursuit, and how defenceless I was.
                              I could trust nobody. The fellow sleeping at my side by the camp-fire
                              might be Nevins's spy. Every stranger that looked at me any way
                              curiously sent a chill to my heart. Whether there were three men or a
                              hundred employed to watch me, I cannot tell; but at every point there
                              was some one to mislead me or balk my plan. The wilds of Montana
                              seemed to be police by this terrible man. Why did n't he kill me,
                                 and<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5557-00000112"/> have done with it? I
                              don't know. My life was in his hands and is to-day. The sense of being
                              surrounded and dogged and shared grew insupportable at last. Can you
                              understand how maddening it was? I gave up the hope of meeting Nevins
                              face to face, and only longed to hide myself somewhere out of his
                              sight.</p>
                           <p>About six months ago I fell in with a man at Shasta, one Thompson, who
                              owned a ranch twenty miles back in the country; he wanted help in
                              managing his herds, and offered me a share in the stock. This business
                              has just turned out disastrously, as I have said. Everything I touch
                              turns worthless. It was a sorry day for you, poor Joe, when you joined
                              fortune with me. I could sink a cork ship. I am Jonah without Jonah's
                              whale. If ever I am thrown overboard, I shall be drowned, mark
                              that.</p>
                           <p>I had to leave the ranch, and left it two days ago. The moment I put
                              foot in Shasta I felt I was again under the eye of Nevins's invisible
                              police. I am not sure I shall escape them by going into the army. I am
                              not sure, on patriotic grounds, that I <emph>ought</emph> to go into
                              the army. My luck is enough to brings on a national defeat.</p>
                           <p>In all these thirty-six months, Joe, I had not heard a word from
                              Rivermouth,—until last night. I suppose pose you must have written to
                              me; if you have, your letters missed fire. No one else, I imagine, has
                              been much troubled about my fate. My dear old friend, Parson Wibird,
                              is dead, and Miss Palfrey is going to marry his successor. So runs the
                              world away! These two items of news gave a hard tug at my
                              heart-strings. I got the intelligence in the oddest way. Last night,
                              sitting on the porch of the hotel, I overheard a stranger talking
                              about Rivermouth. You may fancy I pricked up my ears at the word, and
                              invented occasion to speak with the man. He did not belong to the
                              town, but he appeared to have come from there lately, and I gathered
                              from him all I wanted to know—and more! O Joe! there are things in the
                              world that cut one up more cruelly than hunger and cold. But I can't
                              write of this. I did not mean to write so long a letter; I meant only
                              to let you know I was alive. Indeed, I am in frightfully good health.
                              If I had been rich and happy, I might have been dead these two years.
                              "There 's nae luck aboot the house!"</p>
                           <p>I'm not breathing a word of reproach against anybody, you understand.
                              I have n't the right. I have made my own bed, and if I don't lie in it
                              comfortably, there's no one to blame except myself.<pb n="220-221"
                                 xml:id="VAC5557-00000113"/> see my mistake. I ought to have stayed
                              at Red Rock, and gone to work again, like a man. But it's too late
                              now.</p>
                           <p>Good by, my dear Joe. I hope you are prospering, you and your tribe.
                              There must be a lot of you by this time! You continue, I suppose, to
                              have an annual brother or sister? I trust Uncle Dent is well also. He
                              is a fine old fellow, and I've regretted a thousand times that I
                              quarrelled with him. But he <emph>did</emph> brush my hair the wrong
                              way. I start from here to-morrow for the East. I have not decided yet
                              whether to join the army in the North or in the West; but wherever I
                              go, I am, my dear boy,</p>

               <p>Mr. Joseph Twombly read these eight pages through twice very carefully,
                  interrupting himself from time to time to give vent to an exclamation of surprise
                  or pity or disapproval or indignation, as the mood moved him.</p>
               <p>"Poor Jack!" said Twombly. "He is a kind of Jonah, sure enough, and I don't
                  believe the healthiest whale in the world could keep him on its stomach for five
                  minutes. What a foolish fellow to throw himself away in that fashion! Why in
                  thunder didn't he tell me where to write him? October 31st. That's more than a
                  month ago. The Lord only knows what may have happened since then."</p>
               <p>Twombly sat pondering for some time with his elbows on the desk; then he folded up
                  the letter, and placed it in a fresh envelope, which he directed in a large,

               <head type="sub">KING COPHETUA AND THE BEGGAR MAID.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>MR. DENT had watched the increasing intimacy between Prudence and
                  the young minister with much peculiar, secret satisfaction, as the reader has been
                  informed; and that afternoon, while she and Mr. Dillingham were gazing at the
                  sunset through the embrasure of the fort, Mr. Dent, in spite of the pain in his
                  ankle, of which he had complained earlier in the day, was walking briskly up and
                  down the library, building castles for the young people.</p>
               <p>When a man has reached the age of Mr. Dent, and is too rheumatic himself to occupy
                  castles in the air, he indulges in this kind of architecture for the benefit of
                  others, that is, if he has a generous nature, and Mr. Dent had a very generous
                  nature. To see Prue well settled in life, and to have two or three of Prue's
                  children playing around the arm-chair of his old age, was his only dream now. So,
                  in constructing his castles, he added to each a wing for a nursery on a scale more
                  extensive, perhaps, than would have been approved by either of the prospective
                  tenants, if the architect had submitted his plans to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent had never asked himself—and possibly the question would have posed
                  him—why he was so willing now for Prudence to marry, when the thought of her
                  marrying had appeared so terrible to him in connection with his nephew. It was
                  John Dent's misfortune, perhaps, that he was the first to stir Mr. Dent's parental
                  jealousy; maybe Mr. Dillingham would have fared no better, if he had come first.
                  At all events, he had come second, and Mr. Dent was far from raising
                  objections.</p>
               <p>He was in the sunniest of humors, this afternoon, contemplating Prue's possible
                  happiness and his own patriarchal comfort in it, when Fanny brought in the evening
                  papers, and with them the letter which Mr. Joseph Twombly had considerately mailed
                  to Mr. Dent a few days before.</p>
               <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC5557-00000115"/>
               <p>He tore open the envelope carelessly, recognizing Twombly's handwriting, but the
                  sight of John Dent's penmanship gave him a turn. He ran over the pages hurriedly,
                  and with various conflicting emotions, among which a sympathy for Jack's past and
                  present sufferings was not, it is to be feared, so pronounced as Twombly's had
                  been.</p>
               <p>It was unquestionably a relief to know that Jack was alive and in good health; but
                  it was a little unfortunate to have the letter come just then, when everything was
                  going on so smoothly. The reflection that Jack might take it into his head to
                  return to Rivermouth and insist on marrying Prue, was not agreeable to Mr. Dent.
                  He had assented to this at one time; he had overlooked his nephew's poverty, but
                  since then John Dent had not behaved handsomely to Prue.</p>
               <p>Whatever Prudence's feelings were, this letter could but disturb her. It would set
                  her to thinking of the past, and that was not desirable. But why show her the
                  letter, at present?—he would have to show it to her if he spoke of it; why not
                  wait until he heard again from Jack, whose plans were still with loose ends? He
                  could not be put into possession of the Hawkins property or even informed that he
                  was to inherit it, for the year specified in the will lacked several months of
                  expiration. Moreover, the letter was one that for several reasons could not well
                  be shown to Prudence; it spoke of her marriage as a foregone conclusion,—the very
                  way to unsettle everything; and then what business had Jack to go and say there
                  were things in the world that cut one up more cruelly than hunger and cold? What
                  an intemperate kind of phraseology that was!</p>
               <p>These reflections were struggling through Mr. Dent's mind when he heard the
                  clatter of hoofs at the gate. He crumpled the letter in his hand, and thrusting it
                  into his pocket, hastened out to the front door. In the middle of the hall he
                  recollected what a bad state his ankle was in, and limped the rest of the way.</p>
               <p>"Won't you stop to tea, Dillingham?" he cried, as he saw the young clergyman with
                  one foot in the stirrup, Mr. Dillingham having dismounted to assist Prudence from
                  the saddle.</p>
               <p>"Thanks, my friend; but to-night, you know,<pb n="226-227"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000116"/> is the night I am obliged to prepare my
                  sermon."</p>
               <p>With which words Mr. Dillingham touched his hat to Miss Palfrey, waved his hand
                  smilingly to Mr. Dent, and rode away.</p>
               <p>As Prudence came up the gravelled path, with the trail of her riding habit thrown
                  over her arm, showing two neat bronze boots, she was too much engaged with her own
                  thoughts to notice Mr. Dent closely; at another time she would have seen that
                  something had disturbed him. Mr. Dent was sharper sighted, and he saw that
                  Prudence was laboring under unusual excitement. Had Dillingham spoken at last, and
                  if so, how had Prue taken it? He did not dare to conjecture, for he felt it would
                  be a bitter disappointment to him if she had refused Dillingham.</p>
               <p>"At any rate," Mr. Dent said to himself, "Jack's letter is not the thing for
                  popular reading just now."</p>
               <p>After tea Prudence told her guardian what had passed between her and Mr.
                  Dillingham. He had asked her to be his wife, but so abruptly and unexpectedly,
                  that he had startled her more than she liked. He had, without any warning, leaned
                  forward and taken her hand while they were looking at the sunset in the bastion of
                  the ruined fort; then he had stepped down from his horse, much as King Cophetua
                  must have stepped down from the throne, and stood at her stirrup-side.</p>
               <p>Prudence felt it would be dreadfully sentimental to repeat what Mr. Dillingham had
                  said to her, so she did not repeat his words, but gave Mr. Dent the substance of
                  them. The young man perceived that the suddenness of his action had displeased
                  Prudence, and begged to be forgiven for that, and for the abruptness of his words,
                  if they seemed abrupt to her; they did not seem so to him, for he had carried her
                  presence in his thought from the hour he first saw her. If during the past months
                  he had concealed his feelings in regard to her, it was because he knew his own
                  unworthiness, and did not dare to hope for so great happiness as her love would be
                  to him. He had betrayed his secret involuntarily; the hour, the place, and her
                  nearness must plead for him.</p>
               <p>"He really turned it very neatly," said Prue,<pb n="228-229"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000117"/> trying to brush off the bloom of romance which she
                  was conscious overspread her story, though she had endeavored to tell it in as
                  prosaic a manner as possible.</p>
               <p>"He's a noble fellow," exclaimed Mr. Dent warmly, "and is worthy of any woman,—the
                  best of women, and that's you."</p>
               <p>"He is noble," said Prudence, meditatively; "and as he stood there, looking up at
                  me, I think I more than half loved him."</p>
               <p>"And you told him so!" cried Mr. Dent.</p>
               <p>"No, I did not," said Prudence, with a perplexed expression clouding her
                  countenance. "The words were on my lips, but I could not say them. I could not say
                  anything at first; he quite took away my breath. When I was able to speak I was
                  full of doubt. I do not know if I love him. I esteem him and admire him; he has
                  genius and goodness, and I can understand how a woman might be very proud of his
                  love; but when he asked me to marry him, it startled me and pained me, instead
                  of—of making me very happy, you know."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent did not know at all; Prudence's insensibility and hesitation were simply
                  incomprehensible prehensible to him; but he nodded his head appreciatively, as if
                  he took in the whole situation.</p>
               <p>"What did you say to him?"</p>
               <p>"Almost what I am saying to you."</p>
               <p>"But that was not a very definite answer to a proposal of marriage, it strikes
                  me."</p>
               <p>"I asked him not to refer to the subject again at present."</p>
               <p>"That was dodging the question, Prue."</p>
               <p>"I wanted time, uncle, to know my own mind."</p>
               <p>In effect, Prudence had neither accepted nor rejected the young minister.</p>
               <p>"Rather flattering for a man of Dillingham's character and position," thought Mr.
                  Dent, "to be kept cooling his heels in an anteroom that way."</p>
               <p>"You see, uncle, it was too important a step to be taken without reflection.
                  Thoughtless people should not be allowed to marry, ever."</p>
               <p>"How long will it take you, Prue, to know your mind?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know," she said, restlessly; "a week—a month, perhaps."</p>
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5557-00000118"/>
               <p>"And in the mean time Dillingham will continue his visits here just the same?"</p>
               <p>"Just the same. I arranged all that."</p>
               <p>"O, you arranged all that?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"But won't it be a little awkward for everybody?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose so," said Prudence, looking wretched as she thought it over.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent was too wily to say anything more, for he saw that if Prudence was urged
                  in her present wavering humor to give Dillingham a conclusive answer, it might
                  possibly be in the negative.</p>
               <p>However, the ice was broken, that was one point gained; the rest would naturally
                  follow; for Prue could not long remain blind to the merits of a man like
                  Dillingham, after knowing that he loved her. Mr. Dent laughed in his sleeve,
                  thinking how sly it was in the young parson to corner Prue up there in the old
                  fort, and attempt to carry her by storm. A vague exultation at Prue's not allowing
                  herself to be taken in this sudden assault, formed, in spite of him, an ingredient
                  in the good gentleman's merriment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham passed the following evening at Willowbrook as though nothing
                  unusual had occurred between him and Miss Palfrey. If the beggar maid, instead of
                  accepting King Cophetua on the spot,—as I suppose the minx did,—had reserved her
                  decision for a month or two to consider the matter, the king could not have
                  behaved meanwhile with more tact and delicacy than Mr. Dillingham exercised on
                  this evening and in his subsequent visits.</p>
               <p>Prudence carefully but not ostensibly avoided being left alone with him, and there
                  was none of that awkwardness or constraint attending the resumption of purely
                  friendly intercourse which Mr. Dent had anticipated.</p>
               <p>Observing that the young people no longer rode horseback, Mr. Dent hastened the
                  cure of his ankle, and the rides were resumed under his supervision; but the
                  bridle-path leading to the old earthworks was tacitly ignored by all parties.
                  Prudence and Mr. Dillingham had gone that road once too often if nothing was to
                  come of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham retraced his steps so skilfully, and had come back with so good
                     grace<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5557-00000119"/> to the point from which he had
                  diverged, that Prudence began to doubt if she had not dreamed that tender episode
                  of the old fort, and to question if the old fort itself were not a figment. The
                  whole scene and circumstance had become so unreal to her that one morning, riding
                  alone, as she sometimes did now, she let Jenny turn into the rocky path leading to
                  the crest of the hill, and secured ocular proof that the ruined earthwork at least
                  was a fact. Standing there in the embrasure, she felt for an instant as if the
                  young clergyman's hand rested on her own. That same evening Mr. Dillingham made it
                  all seem like a delusion again by talking to her and smiling upon her just as he
                  had done the month previously. But the recollection that he had asked her to be
                  his wife, and that she had a response to make to the momentous question, now and
                  then came over Prudence like a chill.</p>
               <p>Rather vexatiously for Mr. Dent, somewhat restlessly for his ward, and perhaps not
                  altogether happily for Mr. Dillingham,—however composed he seemed,—two weeks went
                  by.</p>

            <div type="chapter">

               <head type="sub">COLONEL PEYTON TODHUNTER.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>AT the end of those two weeks, Mr. Dillingham, who had not spoken to
                  Mr. Dent relative to the position of affairs between himself and Prudence, took
                  occasion to do so one December afternoon, as he was sitting with his friend before
                  the open wood-fire in the library.</p>
               <p>There is a quality in an open wood-fire that stimulates confidence; it is easy, in
                  the warm, mellow glow, to say what it would be impossible with other accessories
                  to put into unreluctant words; there is no place like an old-fashioned
                  chimney-side in which to make love or to betray the secret of your bosom.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent was in an unusually receptive state for the young minister's confidence.
                  The slow process by which Prudence was arriving at a knowledge of her own mind did
                  not rhyme well with her guardian's impatience, and was<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000120"/> beginning to depress him. He had expected, as a
                  matter of course, that his friend Dillingham would seize the first opportunity,
                  and he had given him several, to broach the subject; but two weeks had elapsed,
                  and the young man had not spoken. Mr. Dent drew a distressing inference from this
                  silence. Perhaps while Prudence was pondering what to do, Mr. Dillingham was
                  regretting what he had done. Mr. Dent ached to give the young minister an
                  encouraging word; but he could not, without a sacrifice to his dignity, be the
                  first to touch upon the topic. He desired above all things that Prudence should
                  wed Dillingham, but he was not going to throw her at his head.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Dillingham saw fit, then, this December afternoon, to break through his
                  reticence, his friend welcomed the confidence eagerly. The younger man was
                  gratified, but presumably not surprised, to find that Mr. Dent had his interests
                  very much at heart.</p>
               <p>"Nothing in the world, Dillingham, would make me happier," Mr. Dent was saying,
                  with his hand resting on the young minister's shoulder, when Fanny came into the
                  room and gave Mr. Dent a card.</p>
               <p>"Colonel Peyton Todhunter," Mr. Dent read aloud. "What an extraordinary name!
                  Wants to see me? I don't know any Colonel Todhunter. Another subscription to the
                  soldiers' fund, maybe. Show him in, Fanny."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I had better withdraw," suggested Mr. Dillingham.</p>
               <p>"Not at all; the gentleman will not detain me long, and I have a great deal to say
                  to you."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham rose from the chair and walked to the farther part of the library,
                  where he occupied himself in looking over a portfolio of Hogarth prints. Presently
                  Fanny, with a rather confused air, ushered in the visitor,—a compactly built
                  gentleman somewhat above the medium height, with closely cut hair, light whiskers
                  and mustache, inclining to red, and a semi-military bearing. He wore, in fact, the
                  undress uniform of an officer of artillery.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Dent,—Mr. Ralph Dent?" inquired this personage.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; I am Mr. Ralph Dent."</p>
               <p>"My name is Todhunter,—Colonel Todhunter, of South Carolina."</p>
               <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC5557-00000121"/>
               <p>Mr. Dent bowed somewhat formally, for he was an uncompromising Union man, and a
                  South Carolinian colonel—a prisoner on parole, he supposed—was not a savory
                  article to his nostrils.</p>
               <p>"Of South Carolina?" repeated Mr. Dent, placing a chair at the colonel's
                  disposal.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I ought to say, sir," said Colonel Todhunter, seating himself stiffly,
                  "that I am in the United States army. I am one of the few West Point officers born
                  in the South who have stuck to the old flag. Stuck to the old flag, sir."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent complimented him on his loyalty, and begged, with a slight access of
                  suavity, to know how he could be of service to him.</p>
               <p>"I come on very unhappy business; business of a domestic nature, sir," said the
                  colonel, glowering at Mr. Dillingham as much as to say, "Who in the devil is that
                  exceedingly lady-like young gentleman in the white choker?"</p>
               <p>"Whatever your business is," said Mr. Dent, disturbed by this gloomy preamble, "do
                  not hesitate to speak in the presence of my friend, the Rev. Mr. Dillingham. Mr.
                  Dillingham, Colonel Todhunter."</p>
               <p>The two gentlemen bowed distantly.</p>
               <p>"I am the bearer of bad news for you, sir," said the colonel, turning to Mr. Dent.
                  "Your nephew—"</p>
               <p>"Gad, I knew it was Jack!" muttered Mr. Dent. "My nephew, Colonel Todhunter? I
                  hope he is in no trouble."</p>
               <p>"In very serious trouble, sir. In fact, sir, you must prepare yourself for the
                  worst. In a skirmish with the enemy last month, near Rich Mountain, he was wounded
                  and taken prisoner, and has since died. He was in my regiment, sir; the 10th
                  Illinois."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent, who had partly risen from his chair, sank back into the seat. Though
                  Jack's letter, when it came a fortnight before, had annoyed him, he had been glad
                  to know the boy was alive and well, gladder than he acknowledged to himself. The
                  intelligence of Jack's death, dropping upon him like a shell from a mortar,—for
                  the colonel had acquitted himself of his duty with military brevity and
                  precision,—nearly prostrated Mr. Dent.</p>
               <p>"Dear me, Dillingham," he said huskily, "this is very sad."</p>
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5557-00000122"/>
               <p>He sat for several moments without speaking, and then, recollecting his position
                  as host, he begged the young minister to ring for Fanny and ask her to bring in
                  some sherry and biscuits for the colonel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent took a glass of the wine mechanically, which he held untasted in his
                  hand, leaving it to Mr. Dillingham to entertain the stranger.</p>
               <p>"Did I understand you to say you were from South Carolina?" asked Mr. Dillingham,
                  breaking through the thin ice of his reserve.</p>
               <p>"From South Carolina, sir," replied the colonel.</p>
               <p>"That is also my State," said the young clergyman. "I am distantly connected by
                  marriage with one branch of the Todhunters,—the Randalls."</p>
               <p>"I come from the Peyton branch, sir. I beg a hundred pardons, sir, but I did not
                  quite catch your name when our afflicted friend did me the honor."</p>
               <p>"Dillingham."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes, I recollect," said the colonel, fixing his eye abstractedly on the
                  ceiling, and fingering his glass, "a Todhunter did marry a Dillingham; but it was
                  one of the other branch. However, sir, delighted to make your acquaintance;
                  delighted"; and Colonel Todhunter, who had not spared the sherry, shook hands
                  effusively with Mr. Dillingham, who immediately froze over again.</p>
               <p>The conversation between them still went on, with a difference, and the colonel
                  explained how he came to be the bearer of the mournful news just delivered. Young
                  Dent had joined his regiment only a short time before, but he had taken a liking
                  to the young man; saw his ability with half an eye, sir. Was terribly cut up when
                  the report came in that young Dent was hurt. Dent had mentioned the fact of his
                  uncle living at Rivermouth, and the colonel, being at Boston on private affairs,
                  determined to bring the information in person. The report of Dent's death in the
                  rebel hospital—or rather in an ambulance, for he died on the way to the hospital,
                  sir—had reached the colonel as he was on the point of starting for the North.</p>
               <p>After this the conversation flagged; the colonel made several attempts to leave,
                  but the decanter<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC5557-00000123"/> canter of sherry
                  seemed to exert a baleful fascination over him. Finally he departed.</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, Dillingham," said Mr. Dent, "this grieves me more than I can tell
                  you."</p>
               <p>"I can understand your sorrow," said Mr. Dillingham softly. "I once lost a nephew,
                  and though he was only a child, and I was very young then, the impression lingered
                  with me for years. It was my first knowledge of death."</p>
               <p>"I have known death before," said Mr. Dent sadly; "it is always new and strange."
                  Then after a long pause: "I would like to have your advice on one point,
                  Dillingham. Years ago there was a slight love-passage between Prue and my
                  nephew,—a boy's and girl's love affair, which amounted to nothing; but for all
                  that, this news will affect Prue seriously—under the circumstances. I am certain
                  of it. How can I tell her?"</p>
               <p>"Is it necessary to inform her immediately?" asked Mr. Dillingham,
                  thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid it is; there is, you know, a question of property involved."</p>
               <p>"Of course," said Mr. Dillingham, "I would naturally advocate any step to shield
                  Miss Palfrey from a thing likely to afflict her. So perhaps my judgment is not
                  worth much; but suppose there should be some mistake in this? Colonel Todhunter's
                  account, according to his own showing, is at second hand. It may or may not be
                  authentic. Why take the darkest view of the case, while there is a chance to hope
                  that he has been misinformed or deceived? Either of these things is likely. If I
                  were entirely disinterested, I believe I should advise keeping this from Miss
                  Palfrey as long as possible. In the mean time, with her mind undisturbed—"</p>
               <p>"You are right; you are always right, Dillingham."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent grasped eagerly at the slight hope held out by the young minister's
                  words. There was Lieutenant Goldstone, Goldstone's youngest son, reported killed
                  at Big Bethel, reported officially; prayers were offered in church for the family,
                  and they had gone into mourning, when young Goldstone announced himself at
                  head-quarters one day, having escaped through<pb n="242-243"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000124"/> the Confederate lines. This and two or three
                  similar instances occurred to Mr. Dent, and he began to be sanguine that the worst
                  had not happened. It would be a remarkable thing, indeed, if Jack, after passing,
                  three years unscathed among the desperadoes of Montana and California, should be
                  killed within a week after setting foot on civilized ground, even in a state of
                  war. Mr. Dent was one of those men who have the faculty of deferring the
                  unpleasant, and seem, superficially considered, to be lacking in proper
                  sensibility; while in fact it is the excess of sensibility that causes them to
                  shrink, as long as may be, from facing what is disagreeable.</p>
               <p>"Dillingham," he exclaimed, looking up quickly, "I hope Colonel Todhunter will not
                  spread this rumor in town. It would be dreadful for Prue to hear it unprepared.
                  Stories fly so! I wish you would hunt up the colonel and caution him."</p>
               <p>"I will," returned Mr. Dillingham, "and I will do it without delay. I confess,
                  however, that nothing less urgent would induce me to continue his acquaintance. I
                  was not favorably impressed by him."</p>
               <p>"Nor I. He likes his sherry," observed Mr. Dent, glancing at the empty decanter,
                  and smiling.</p>
               <p>"Much too well," said Mr. Dillingham gravely.</p>
               <p>The young minister lost no time in returning to the hotel, and the first person he
                  met was Colonel Todhunter, who had been refreshing himself at the sample-room
                  attached to Odiorne's grocery. The colonel was in so boisterous a mood that it was
                  not pleasant to confer with him in a public place like the doorway of the Old Bell
                  Tavern, and Mr. Dillingham was obliged to invite the gentleman into the study.</p>
               <p>During the four days he remained in town, Colonel Todhunter left very few
                  sample-rooms unexplored. By sheer force of instinct, and seemingly without effort
                  on his part, he went directly to every place where mixed drinks weir obtainable.
                  He made the acquaintance of everybody, spent his money with a lavish hand, and was
                  continually saying, "Gentlemen, will you walk up and cool your coppers?" In less
                  than twenty-four hours Colonel Peyton<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5557-00000125"/>
                  Todhunter was a marked character in Rivermouth, and stood deservedly high in the
                  estimation of those gentlemen—mostly congregated at Odiorne's grocery—whose
                  coppers required periodical cooling.</p>
               <p>Jeremiah Bowditch was seen flitting about the streets at this period, in a state
                  of high cerebral excitement. He became almost ubiquitous under the colonel's
                  inspiration, and nearly accomplished, the difficult feat of taking two drinks at
                  the same instant in two different sections of the town. Those were halcyon days
                  for Mr. Bowditch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham was grossly scandalized by the unseemly conduct of Colonel
                  Todhunter, who, on the score of the far-off matrimonial alliance between their
                  families, claimed a near relationship with the young minister, and insisted on
                  dropping into his rooms at all hours of the day and night. "My cousin James," he
                  would remark, a little pompously, to the admiring circle in Odiorne's store, "has
                  lost something of his hearty Southern manner since he came up North; but he's a
                  good fellow at bottom." "Dill, my boy," he was overheard to say one night, when
                  the young clergyman was vainly remonstrating with him on the staircase of the
                  hotel,—"Dill, my boy, you're a trump,—you <emph>are</emph>!"</p>
               <p>All this was very shocking, and for once the gentle face of Mr. Dillingham lost
                  its serenity. The anxious, worn expression that came upon it showed how keenly he
                  was suffering from the colonel's persecutions.</p>
               <p>The day succeeding Colonel Todhunter's visit to Willowbrook Mr. Dent drove over to
                  town to pay his respects to the colonel, if he had not already gone, and to
                  interrogate him more explicitly as to the sources of his information concerning
                  the unhappy tidings he had brought. At the interview the day before Mr. Dent had
                  been too much distressed to inquire, as he afterwards wished to do, into the
                  particulars of the case. The colonel was not in.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you are fortunate in not finding him," said Mr. Dillingham wearily. "He
                  is drinking, and behaving himself in the most reckless manner. I have no doubt
                  Colonel Todhunter is a warm-hearted, loyal person,"—Mr. Dillingham would not speak
                     unleavened<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC5557-00000126"/> evil of any one,—"and in
                  the South his free, liberal ways would be thought nothing of; but here they seem
                  strange, to say the least, and I shall be heartily glad when he clears out."</p>
               <p>"I hope he has not been indiscreet about Jack," said Mr. Dent, uneasily.</p>
               <p>"I do not think he has. I cautioned him, and he appeared to understand that he was
                  not to mention the matter."</p>
               <p>"But a man in his cups will talk."</p>
               <p>"Still, I believe he has said nothing on the subject. I fancy he does not care
                  enough about it. I trust to that for his silence rather than to his promise. I
                  only wish he would go."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent went back to Willowbrook without seeing the colonel, who vanished from
                  the town at the end of the week. But the fame of Colonel Peyton Todhunter was long
                  kept green in Rivermouth, in the confused brain of Mr. Bowditch, and in the annals
                  of Odiorne's grocery store, where the colonel had neglected to pay for numerous
                  miscellaneous drinks. Fanny, the chambermaid at Willowbrook, used to allude to him
                  as "that merry gentleman," his merriment (as Fanny afterwards confessed to Wingate
                  gate, the coachman), having expressed itself to her in a most astonishing wink
                  just as she was ushering him that day into Mr. Dent's library. Against the dull
                  background of New England life, the figure of the gay artillery officer stood out
                  like a dash of scarlet in a twilight sky.</p>
               <p>The gallant colonel had dawned on the Rivermouthians like the god Quetzalcoatl on
                  the Aztecs, like Hiawatha on the Indian tribes of North America; and like them,
                  also, he had departed mysteriously. A belief in his second coming, to inaugurate
                  an era of gratuitous Jamaica rum, formed a creed all by itself among a select few.
                  Mr. Odiorne was very anxious to have him come again; but his was a desire rather
                  than a belief.</p>
               <p>The more Mr. Dent reflected on Colonel Todhunter's visit, the more sceptical he
                  grew on the subject of his nephew's death.</p>
               <p>"He's a rattle-brained, worthless fellow," said Mr. Dent, meaning Colonel
                  Todhunter, "and I don't believe a word of it. But what could possess him to come
                  to me with such a story? What possesses people to do all sorts<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000127"/> of mad things? Maybe it was a drunken freak of the
                  colonel's; perhaps he intended to borrow money of me, and forgot to do so. Very
                  likely he borrowed money of Dillingham. I'll ask him."</p>
               <p>Colonel Todhunter <emph>had</emph> borrowed fifty dollars of the young clergyman.
                  Mr. Dent enjoyed that. </p>
               <p>"You may smile, my friend," said Mr. Dillingham, acknowledging the fact, "but I
                  was not so blind a victim as you imagine. I attached a slight condition to the
                  loan,—that he should clear out on the instant. If he had suspected his strength he
                  could have wrung ten times the sum from me. The colonel was an infliction, a
                  positive agony, and I think I did very well to invest fifty dollars in his
                  departure."</p>
               <p>"You may rely upon it, Dillingham, that man was an impostor, and his purpose was
                  money."</p>
               <p>"I begin to fear so," said Mr. Dillingham. "It is disheartening to see a man of
                  good average ability, like the colonel's, fallen so low."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent laughed, not at the unworldliness of the young clergyman,—that was rather
                  touching to Mr. Dent,—but at the picture he had in his mind of the consternation
                  and panic into which his friend must have been thrown by the insolent familiarity
                  of the dashing Southern colonel during his sojourn at the Old Bell Tavern. The man
                  had necessarily stayed at the same house, there being but one hotel in the
                  town.</p>
               <p>That Colonel Peyton Todhunter was an adventurer and a rascal was so excellent a
                  key to the enigma of his raid on Rivermouth, that Mr. Dent in his heart forgave
                  him, and felt rather under obligations to him for his moral turpitude. If the
                  colonel had been a gentleman, Mr. Dent would have been forced to receive his
                  communication in good faith; as it was, Mr. Dent was not going to give it the
                  faintest credence.</p>
               <p>"Must know Jack, though," Mr. Dent reflected; "must have known that Jack was not
                  in the habit of writing to me, or the man would not have dared to come here with
                  any such yarn. If the colonel is a sample of the<pb n="250-251"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000128"/> friends Jack has picked up, I hope he has not
                  picked up many."</p>
               <p>The result of Mr. Dent's cogitations was that Colonel Todhunter's statement was a
                  fabrication, at least the tragic part of it; the man must have had a general
                  knowledge of Jack's antecedents and of his present surroundings, or he would not
                  have been able to invent so plausible a story. The colonel was a bounty-agent, a
                  camp hanger-on of some kind, and had come across Jack in the army. It was clear
                  that Jack had carried out the intention, expressed in his letter to Twombly, to
                  join the service; the rest was apocryphal.</p>
               <p>Strengthened by Mr. Dillingham's view of the case, Mr. Dent concluded for the
                  present to keep from Prudence the nature of Colonel Todhunter's visit, and also
                  decided not to mention the letter which John Dent had written to Twombly. If it
                  had not been for Parson Hawkins's will, Mr. Dent would have laid both matters
                  before her now without hesitation; but he remembered how Prudence had recoiled at
                  the mere suggestion of becoming John Dent's heir,—it was not to be wondered at
                  under the circumstances,—and he lacked the courage to inform her of Colonel
                  Todhunter's ridiculous report.</p>
               <p>If Jack had actually been killed in action, it was not a difficult thing to obtain
                  an official statement of the fact; if there was nothing in the story, it would be
                  worse than useless to annoy Prue with it. The matrimonial question still remained
                  open, and was sufficiently vexatious without other complications.</p>
               <p>Prudence's capricious delay in making up her mind about Mr. Dillingham pressed
                  more heavily each day on Mr. Dent. It was so unfair to Dillingham; but what could
                  he, Mr. Dent, do? If he urged her to marry the young man, she would probably
                  refuse. If he let matters take their own turn, they might be Heaven only knew how
                  long in coming to a satisfactory end. In the mean time there was John Dent likely
                  to be alive or likely to be dead at any moment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent's was an open nature, and to be the repository of secrets weighed him
                  down. His face was a dial on which the workings of the inner man were recorded
                  with inconvenient<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5557-00000129"/> accuracy. Prudence
                  observed her guardian's perturbed state, and attributed it to her own perversity
                  in not loving Mr. Dillingham on the spot.</p>
               <p>Though Mr. Dent discredited the colonel's assertions, they troubled him; but
                  Prudence's procrastination troubled him more. Mr. Dillingham had borne it with
                  noble patience, but he was obviously becoming restless under the suspense. A man
                  may be a saint, yet, after all, there are circumstances under which a saint may be
                  forgiven for recollecting that he is a man.</p>
               <p>"I don't think Prue understands how painful this is for Dillingham," thought Mr.
                  Dent. "She takes it very coolly herself. She was twice as much exercised the other
                  day in deciding whether she should put a green or a purple stride into an afghan.
                  I never saw such a girl!"</p>
               <p>Of the three persons concerned, Mr. Dent was perhaps the most worthy of
                  commiseration, though Prudence was far from being as unruffled and happy as she
                  had the grace to appear.</p>
               <p>The conference between Mr. Dent and the young minister, interrupted by the
                  apparition of Colonel Peyton Todhunter that winter afternoon, was resumed a few
                  days subsequently, and was most satisfactory to both parties. Prue's
                  conscientiousness, which amounted almost to a flaw in her character, explained her
                  hesitation in responding to his young friend's wishes. (That was the way Mr. Dent
                  put it.) When she did give him her heart, it would be a heart of gold, and Would
                  be given royally. Mr. Dillingham did not regard this extreme delicacy, as a flaw
                  in Miss Palfrey; on the contrary, it heightened his admiration for her, and he
                  would await the event with as much patience as he could teach himself.</p>
               <p>"By the by, Dillingham," said the amiable tactician, "I got a letter this morning
                  from the War Department. My nephew is not down on the pay-roll of the 10th
                  Illinois. I wrote to them relative to Colonel Todhunter. The colonel of the 10th
                  Illinois is—what's his name?—I declare it has slipped my mind; and there's no such
                  person in the regiment as Todhunter. Practically, I suppose there are<pb
                     n="254-255" xml:id="VAC5557-00000130"/> plenty of tod-hunters in the regiment,
                  but they are not so named."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham smiled, as one smiles at the jokes of one's meditated
                  father-in-law.</p>
               <p>"And so the man really was an impostor?"</p>
               <p>"Of course he was. I suspected it the instant I set eyes on him," said Mr. Dent
                  unblushingly.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>WHEN, months before, Mr. Dillingham's intimacy at Willowbrook had
                  given rise to those cruel stories which made Prudence half wish the young minister
                  would fall in love with her, that she might refuse him and prove how far she was
                  from dying of blighted affections,—at that time it had seemed a simple thing to
                  Prudence to tell Mr. Dillingham that she valued his esteem very highly, that she
                  wanted him always for her friend, but that she could never love him. One cannot be
                  positive that she had not, in some idle moment, framed loosely in her thought a
                  pretty little speech embodying these not entirely novel sentiments; but if this
                  were the case, there was a difficulty now which she had not anticipated in the
                  pronouncing of that little sentence.</p>
               <p>Did she want to pronounce it? If such was<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC5557-00000131"
                  /> to be the tenor of her reply to Mr. Dillingham, why had she not spoken the
                  words that evening in the fort? There had been her time and chance to sweep all
                  the Rivermouth gossips from the board with one wave of her hand, and so end the
                  game. To be sure, Mr. Dillingham had confused her by the abruptness of his
                  declaration; but she had recovered herself almost instantly, and ought to have
                  been frank with him then and there. But she had been unable to give him an answer
                  then, and now two weeks and more had slipped away, leaving her in the same abject
                  state of indecision. Thus far Mr. Dillingham had shown to Prudence no sign of
                  impatience; but her guardian was plainly harassed by her temporizing, and to
                  Prudence herself the situation had grown intolerable.</p>
               <p>She knew what her guardian's wishes were, though he had not expressed them, and
                  his delicacy in not attempting to sway her influenced Prue greatly. She knew that
                  her hesitation was adding to the disappointment and mortification Mr. Dillingham
                  would have to face if she finally said No. He could but draw a happy augury from
                  her delay; for if, in grammar, two negatives make an affirmative, in love, too
                  much hesitation is equivalent to at least half a Yes. She was not certain that her
                  vacillation had not made it imperative on her to accept his addresses. She stood
                  aghast when she reflected that, without speaking a word, she had partly promised
                  to be his wife.</p>
               <p>The time when she could think lightly of putting aside his proffered love was
                  gone; she shrunk now from the idea of giving him pain. Since Mr. Dillingham
                  settled in Rivermouth her life had been very different, and if he passed out of
                  it, as he must if she could not love him, the days would be blank again. Her
                  esteem and friendship for him had deepened month by month, and during the past two
                  weeks his bearing towards her, his deference, his patience, and his tenderness,
                  had filled her with gratitude to him. There were moments when she felt impelled to
                  go to him and place her hand in his, but some occult influence withheld her. There
                  were other moments, for which she blamed herself, when the thought of him made her
                  cold, a sense of aversion<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5557-00000132"/> sion came
                  over her,—an inexplicable thing. Mr. Dillingham was so wise and noble and
                  conscientious, there was no one with whom to compare him. He had the stable
                  character, the brilliant trained intellect, all the sterling qualities, in short,
                  that—that John Dent had not had. He was not arrogant, or impetuous, or
                  light-minded, as John Dent had been: he had a singularly gentle and affectionate
                  nature, and yet—and the absurdity of the fancy caused Prudence to laugh in the
                  midst of her distractions—she could not imagine herself daring to call Mr.
                  Dillingham "James." It was twice as easy to say "Jack!" even now. In her girlish
                  love for <emph>him</emph> there had been none of these doubts and repulsions and
                  conflicts. She had given him her whole heart, and had not known any better than to
                  be happy about it. Why could she not do that now?</p>
               <p>It was the oddest thing how, whenever she set herself to thinking of Mr.
                  Dillingham, she thought of John Dent.</p>
               <p>There was no one to whom Prudence could appeal for guidance out of the labyrinth
                  into which she had strayed. Mr. Dent could not offer her unprejudiced counsel; she
                  had an intuitive perception of the unfitness of her friend Veronica to help her,
                  and the old parson was in his grave.</p>
               <p>It was positively necessary that she should come to some determination soon; but
                  she was as far away from it as ever that afternoon when these thoughts passed
                  through her mind for the hundredth time.</p>
               <p>"Let me think! let me think!" cried Prudence, walking up and down her room with a
                  tortoise-shell dressing-comb rather unheroically in one hand. Unheroically? I
                  suppose Ophelia twined those wild-flowers in her tresses with some care before she
                  drowned herself. Medea and Clytemnestra would not make so graceful an end of it if
                  they did not look a little to the folds of their drapery. One must eat, and drink,
                  and dress, while life goes on. And if I show my poor little New England heroine in
                  the act of putting up her back hair,—it being nearly six o'clock, and Mr.
                  Dillingham coming to tea,—I feel that I am as true to nature as if I set her on a
                  pedestal.</p>
               <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5557-00000133"/>
               <p>It was her chief beauty, that brown hair, and there were floods of it, with warm
                  sparkles in it here and there, like those bits of gold-leaf that glimmer in a
                  flask of Eau-de-vie de Dantzic when you shake it. She was arranging the hair,
                  after the style of that period, in one massive braid over the brows, making a
                  coronet which a duchess might have been proud to wear. The wonder of this braid
                  was, it cost her nothing.</p>
               <p>As Prudence set the last pin in its place, she regarded herself attentively for a
                  moment in the cheval-glass, and smiled a queer little smile, noticing <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"With half-conscious eye,</l>
                        <l>She wore the colors he approved,"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> a cherry ribbon at the throat and waist.</p>
               <p>"I'm growing to be a fright," said Prudence, looking so unusually lovely that she
                  could well afford to say it, as women always can—when they say it.</p>
               <p>There was a richer tint to her cheeks than ordinarily, and a deeper glow in her
                  eyes this evening, and it did not escape the young minister, who, without seeming
                  to see, saw everything.</p>
               <p>When she came into the library where the two gentlemen sat, both were conscious of
                  the brightness that surrounded her like an atmosphere. "Dillingham's fate is to be
                  signed, sealed, and delivered to-night," was Mr. Dent's internal comment; "there
                  is business in her eye." But poor Prue's brave looks sadly belied her irresolute,
                  coward heart. She had no purpose but to look pretty, and that she accomplished
                  without trying.</p>
               <p>It was Mr. Dillingham's custom to leave Willowbrook at ten o'clock, unless there
                  was other company; then he kept later hours. There were no visitors on this
                  occasion, and the evening appeared endless to Prudence, who paused absently in the
                  midst of her sentences when the timepiece over the fireplace doled out the
                  reluctant half-hours. It seemed to her as if ten o'clock had made up its mind not
                  to come. Once or twice in the course of the evening the conversation flickered and
                  went out curiously, as it was not in the habit of doing among these friends.</p>
               <p>When the talk turns cold in this sort, it requires great tact to bury the corpse
                     decently.<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5557-00000134"/> Even with a gifted young
                  divine to conduct the services, the ceremony is not always a success.</p>
               <p>At half past nine Mr. Dent violated the tacit covenant that had existed between
                  him and Prudence, by leaving her alone with Mr. Dillingham;—for the first time
                  since it had become embarrassing to be left alone with him. They had been
                  discussing a stanza in Lowell's "Vision of Sir Launfal," and Mr. Dent had coolly
                  walked off to the library on a pretext to look up the correct reading.</p>
               <p>Prudence regarded her guardian's action as a dreadful piece of treachery, and the
                  transparency of it was perhaps plain to Mr. Dillingham, who came to her rescue,
                  for an awkward silence had immediately fallen upon Prue, by requesting her to sing
                  a certain air from <title xml:lang="FRA">Les Huguenots</title> which she had been
                  practising.</p>
               <p>Prudence was in no humor for music, but she snatched at the proposition with a
                  kind of gratitude, and sang the passage charmingly, with a malicious enjoyment,
                  meanwhile, in the reflection that her recreant guardian, hearing the piano, would
                  know that his purpose was frustrated. And in fact, at the first note that reached
                  the library, there came over Mr. Dent's face an expression of mingled amusement
                  and disgust, in strange contrast with the exquisite music that provoked it. He
                  stood with one hand lifted to a book-shelf, and listened in a waiting attitude;
                  but when the aria was finished, he made no motion to return to the
                  drawing-room.</p>
               <p>Prudence sat with her fingers playing in dumb-show on the ivory keys, wondering
                  what the next move would be. Mr. Dillingham, who had been turning over a portfolio
                  of tattered sheet-music, took up a piece which he had selected from the
                  collection, and came with it to the piano.</p>
               <p>"I wish you would sing this, Miss Prudence. It is an old favorite of mine, and it
                  is many years since I heard it. These homely Scotch ballads are not perhaps high
                  art, but they have a pathos and an honesty in them which I confess to
                  admiring."</p>
               <p>As the young minister spoke he spread out on the piano-rack some yellowed pages
                     containing<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC5557-00000135"/> ing the words and music
                  of "Auld Robin Gray."</p>
               <p>Prudence gave a little start, and a peculiar look flitted across her face; then
                  she dropped her eyes, and let her hands he listlessly in her lap.</p>
               <p>"But perhaps you don't sing it?" said Mr. Dillingham, catching her half-dreamy,
                  half-pained expression.</p>
               <p>"O yes, I do," said Prudence, rousing herself with an effort, "if I have not
                  forgotten the accompaniment."</p>
               <p>She touched the keys softly, and the old air came back to her like a phantom out
                  of the past. She played the accompaniment through twice, then her voice took up
                  the sweet burden, half inaudibly at first, but gathering strength and precision as
                  she went on. It was not a voice of great compass, but of pure quality and without
                  a cold intonation in it. One has heard famous cantatrici, all art down to their
                  fingernails, who could not sing a simple ballad as Prudence sang this, because
                  they lacked the one nameless touch of nature that makes the whole world kin.
                  "'Young Jamie loo'd me, weel,'" sang Prue,—<q>
                     <lg type="stanza">

               <p>Mr. Dillingham, who understood music thoroughly, as he seemed to understand
                  everything, listened to Prudence with a sort of wonder, though he had heard her
                  sing many a time before. The strange tenderness and passion there was in her voice
                  brought a flush to his pale cheek, as he leaned over the end of the piano, with
                  his eyes upon her.</p>

               <p>It was with unconscious art that Prudence was rendering perfectly both the
                  sentiment and the melody of the song, for her thought was far away from the
                  singing. It was a day in midsummer; the wind scarcely stirred the honeysuckles
                  that clambered over the porch of the little cottage in Horseshoe Lane; John Dent
                  was telling her of his plans and his hopes and his love; it was sunshine and
                  shadow, and something sad; again he was holding her hand; she felt the touch of
                  his lips on her cheek; then she heard the gate close, and the robins chattering in
                  the garden, and the tears welled up to Prue's eyes, as she sang, just as they had
                  done that day when all this had really happened. And still the song went on:— <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"I hadna been a wife a week but only four,</l>
                        <l>When, sitting sae mournfully at the door,</l>
                        <l>I saw my Jamie's wraith, for I couldna think it he,</l>
                        <l>Till he said, I'm come back for to marry thee.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"O, sair did we greet, and muckle did we say;</l>
                        <l>We took but ae kiss, and we tore ourselves away:</l>
                        <l>I wish I were dead—"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Suddenly something grew thick in Prudence's throat; the dual existence she was
                  leading came to an end, and the music died on her lip. She looked up, and met the
                  young clergyman's eyes glowing upon her.</p>
               <p>"I—I can't sing it, after all," she said, with a wan look. "I will sing it another
                  time."</p>
               <p>Then she pushed back the piano-stool abruptly, hesitated a moment, and glided
                  swiftly out of the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham followed her with his eyes, much mystified, as he well might have
                  been, at Prudence's inexplicable agitation and brusqueness. He leaned against the
                  side of the piano, waiting for her to return; but she did not come back again to
                  the drawing-room.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes Mr. Dent appeared, and could scarcely control his astonishment at
                  finding the young minister alone.</p>
               <p>It was as plain to Mr. Dent as one and one make two (though they sometimes refuse
                  to be added together) that events had culminated during his absence. He had
                  intended they should; but there was a depressing heaviness in the atmosphere for
                  which he was not prepared. He did not dare to ask what had happened.</p>
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5557-00000137"/>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham was ill at ease, and after one or two commonplace remarks, he said
                  good night mechanically and withdrew.</p>
               <p>"She has thrown him over, the foolish girl!" muttered Mr. Dent, as he went
                  gloomily up stairs with his bedroom candle in his hand, "and I am devilishly
                  sorry."</p>
               <p>For my part, I think the young minister's fortunate star was not in the ascendant
                  that night, when he asked Prue to sing "Auld Robin Gray."</p>

               <head type="sub">HOW MR. DILLINGHAM LOOKED OUT OF A WINDOW.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>IT was a blustery, frosty morning; the sensitive twigs of trees
                  snapped with the cold; the brass knockers on old-fashioned doors here and there
                  had a sullen, vindictive look, daring you to take hold of them; the sky was
                  slate-color. There was no snow on the ground, but the wind, sweeping up the
                  street, now and then blew the white dust into blinding clouds, which, bursting in
                  the air and sifting lazily downward, seemed to Mr. Dillingham, as he leaned
                  against the casement of a window in the Old Bell Tavern, quite like falling
                  snow.</p>
               <p>The window at which the young minister stood was directly over the front door, and
                  commanded a prospect of the entire length of the street that ran at right angles
                  with the main thoroughfare and terminated at the steps of the hotel. At the other
                  end of this street was the<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5557-00000138"/> long
                  bridge—hidden from time, to time that morning by the swirls of dust—leading to
                  Willowbrook.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham had his eyes fixed upon a distant object approaching from that
                  direction. It was a mere speck when he first descried it on the bridge, tossed and
                  blown hither and thither by the gale; but as it struggled onward he was not slow
                  to detect in this atom the person of Mr. Dent's coachman, Wingate.</p>
               <p>Not an especially interesting atom, Wingate, as a general thing, to the rest of
                  the human family; but he interested Mr. Dillingham very deeply this morning.</p>
               <p>As the coachman drew nearer, the young minister saw that he held something white
                  clutched in his hand, which the marauding winds, now and then swooping down on him
                  from around the corners, attempted to wrest from his grasp. That it was a note
                  from Miss Palfrey, that it was for him, Mr. Dillingham, and that it contained the
                  death-warrant of his hopes, were the conclusions at which he arrived before
                  Wingate gained the stone-crossing opposite the hotel.</p>
               <p>As Wingate reached this point, and was backing ing up against the wind which just
                  then swept furiously around the paint-shop on the corner, a hack stopped suddenly
                  on the crossway. A man leaned from, the window, and called to Wingate, who stared
                  at him stupidly for a moment, then rushed to the side of the carriage and grasped
                  the hand of the occupant; then the two entered into an animated dialogue, if one
                  might judge by the energetic pantomime that ensued.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham watched this encounter—evidently unexpected by both parties—with a
                  feverish restlessness not characteristic of him. His breath came and went quickly,
                  and his impatience seemed to take shape and become crystallized in eccentric
                  zigzag lines on the pane of glass nearest his lips. It was rapidly growing bitter
                  cold without, and the frost was stretching its silvery antennæ over all the
                  windows.</p>
               <p>Finally the carriage drove off, and Wingate, as if possessed to prolong the
                  tantalizing suspense of the young clergyman, stood motionless on the curbstone
                  several minutes looking after the retreating vehicle. Then it appeared to occur to
                  Wingate that he was freezing to death, and he crossed over briskly to the Old Bell
                  Tavern.</p>
               <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5557-00000139"/>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham hurried into the hall and snatched the note from the benumbed
                  fingers of the astonished coachman, who was accustomed to much suavity and
                  frequent fifty-cent pieces from the parson.</p>
               <p>"All right,—Wingate, thank you!" and the door was closed unceremoniously upon the
                  messenger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham broke the seal of the envelope, and read the note at a glance, for
                  it was very brief. Directly after reading it he tore the paper into minute
                  fragments, which he threw into the grate. The gesture with which he accompanied
                  the action, rather than his face, betrayed strong emotion; for his face was
                  composed now, and something almost like a smile played about his lips.</p>
               <p>He stood for a few seconds irresolute in the middle of the apartment; then he went
                  into the adjoining room, his sleeping-chamber, and took down his overcoat from a
                  shelf in the black-walnut wardrobe.</p>
               <p>This was the morning after Prue's musical failure. She had despatched the note to
                  Mr. Dillingham as soon as breakfast was over, but it had been written long before.
                  She had written it in the early gray of the morning,—sitting in a ghostly way at
                  her desk, wrapped in a white cashmere shawl, with her feet thrust into a pair of
                  satin slippers of the Cinderella family, while the house slept. It was one of four
                  letters. The first was six pages, this was sixteen lines—a lesson for
                  scribblers.</p>
               <p>While Wingate was on his way to town with the missive, Prudence was in her room
                  summoning up the resolution to tell Mr. Dent what she had done. It was not a
                  cheerful task to contemplate, remembering how unreasonable and angry he had been
                  when she opposed his wishes before. She had an unclouded perception of the
                  disappointment she was going to give him this time. It was pretty clear to her
                  that he had set his heart on the marriage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent was trying to read the morning paper, when the library door opened
                  gently; he did not look up at once, supposing it was Bodge, the house-boy,
                  bringing in the coals, or Prudence coming to tell him what he dreaded to know
                  positively.</p>
               <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5557-00000140"/>
               <p>When he did look up he saw John Dent standing on the threshold and smiling upon
                  him apologetically.</p>
               <p>"Good God, Jack! is that you?" cried Mr. Dent, letting the paper slip in a heap to
                  his knees.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I—I have come back."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent was not a superstitious person, but he felt for maybe ten seconds that
                  that was an apparition standing over there in the doorway. And there was much in
                  John Dent's aspect calculated to strengthen the impression.</p>
               <p>He was worn and pale, as if he had just recovered from a long illness, or died of
                  it; his cheeks were sunken, his eyes brilliant, and his unkempt black hair was
                  blacker than midnight against his pallor. A shabby overcoat was thrown across one
                  shoulder, concealing the left arm which he carried stiffly at his side. There was
                  a squalor and a misery about him, heightened by his smile, that would have touched
                  the compassion of a stranger. Mr. Dent was in a depressed mood that morning, and
                  this woful figure of his nephew, standing there and smiling upon him like a thing
                  out of the churchyard, nearly brought the tears to his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Why, Jack, boy, how ill you are!"</p>
               <p>"I am only tired," said John Dent, dropping into a chair; "that and the slight
                  hurt I've got."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I heard about that."</p>
               <p>"You heard about it?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I did."</p>
               <p>"How could you have heard of it?"</p>
               <p>"Colonel Todhunter brought the news. Gad! I've done the Colonel something of an
                  injustice."</p>
               <p>"Colonel Todhunter?"</p>
               <p>"I did n't believe a word he said; but then he declared you were dead."</p>
               <p>"Colonel Todhunter did?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"I do not want to contradict Colonel Todhunter, for that would n't be polite,"
                  said John Dent, with one of his old smiles, "but I regret to state that I am not
                  dead. Who <emph>is</emph> Colonel Todhunter, any way?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent stared at him.</p>
               <p>"What! you don't know the Colonel? the Colonel knows you very well. He told us all
                  about it; the skirmish, you know, in which you<pb n="276-277"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000141"/> were wounded, and taken prisoner, and—" Here Mr.
                  Dent paused, seeing by the vacuous expression of his nephew's face that the words
                  were meaningless to him. "Dear me," he thought, "how very much broken up he is;
                  his memory wholly gone."</p>
               <p>"Uncle Ralph," said John Dent, "I never heard of Colonel Todhunter until this
                  moment; I have not been in the army; I have not been in any skirmish; and I have
                  not been taken prisoner."</p>
               <p>This was too calm and categorical a statement not to shake Mr. Dent a little in
                  his suspicion that the speaker was laboring under some mental derangement.</p>
               <p>"I have been wounded, to be sure," continued John Dent. "I was shot in Western
                  Virginia, in the woods, on my way to join the army, shot by George Nevins," he
                  added between his teeth. "I imagine he got tired of me at last, and concluded to
                  kill me. He failed this time; but he will do it, if that is his purpose."</p>
               <p>In reading John Dent's letter to Joseph Twombly, Mr. Dent had smiled at what he
                  considered Jack's hallucination touching the watch which he supposed Nevins was
                  keeping over him night and day; but this attempt on Jack's life, if there had
                  really been one, at a spot so remote from the scene of the robbery three years
                  before, gave a hue of probability to the idea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent looked out of the corner of his eye at his nephew. Perhaps Jack
                     <emph>was</emph> insane. Mr. Dent's faith in the general correctness of the
                  Colonel's statements was coming back to him. Sitting with his arms hanging at his
                  side and his head resting on his chest broodingly, Jack seemed like a person not
                  quite right in his mind.</p>
               <p>"Where is this Colonel Todhunter?" he exclaimed, starting to his feet.</p>
               <p>"Good heavens! don't be so violent!"</p>
               <p>"Where is he, I say?"</p>
               <p>"How can I tell? The man's gone."</p>
               <p>"How long since?"</p>
               <p>"A fortnight ago."</p>
               <p>"Was he here,—in this house?"</p>
               <p>"He came here one afternoon, representing himself as your friend; he stayed in the
                  town four or five days after that, I believe."</p>
               <p>"It is three weeks since I was shot," said<pb n="278-279"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000142"/> John Dent, reflecting. "Did Twombly see him?"</p>
               <p>"I really can't say whether the deacon saw him or not."</p>
               <p>"I don't mean the deacon, I mean Joe."</p>
               <p>"Joseph was in Chicago; been there these six months."</p>
               <p>"Uncle, what kind of person was this Colonel Todhunter? Describe him to me."</p>
               <p>"He was something of a character, I should say; a cool customer; he made himself
                  very much at home—with my sherry."</p>
               <p>"Very gentlemanly, and rather pale?"</p>
               <p>"Well, the sherry was pale," returned Mr. Dent laughing, "but the Colonel was
                  rather florid and not at all gentlemanly; that is to say, he carried it with a
                  high hand in the town, though he behaved decently enough when he called on
                  me."</p>
               <p>"What was he like?"</p>
               <p>"A tall man, taller than you, for instance; strongly built, with blue eyes and
                  long sandy whiskers."</p>
               <p>"GEORGE NEVINS!"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" said Mr. Dent.</p>
               <p>"It was George Nevins, I tell you!"</p>
               <p>"Pooh! you're mad. What would bring him here, of all the places in the world?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know; there are many things I cannot fathom; but this I do know, you have
                  stood face to face with the most daring and accomplished scoundrel that lives.
                  There is n't his match in California or Nevada."</p>
               <p>"Good heavens!" ejaculated Mr. Dent, uneasily, with a sensation of having two or
                  three bullet-holes in the small of his back. "You don't really believe that that
                  man was the fellow Nevins?"</p>
               <p>"I do, assuredly. He thought he had disposed of me, and he came here prospecting.
                  It was like his impudence. He told you I was dead? Well, he had good reason to
                  suppose so."</p>
               <p>"I can't believe it. Gad, I don't believe it! If it had been he, I think I should
                  have turned desperado instinctively, and brought him down with the old shot-gun";
                  and Mr. Dent was making a motion to that nearly harmless weapon, which had hung
                  for years unloaded over the library mantel-piece, when Prudence walked into the
                  room.</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC5557-00000143"/>
               <p>"Drop Colonel Todhunter," whispered Mr. Dent hastily.</p>
               <p>In romances and on the stage, the meeting between two people who, happily or
                  unhappily, have been long separated, is made the occasion of much sensational
                  business; abut I have observed that people in real life, who have loved or hated
                  each other, are not apt, when they meet after a lapse of years, either to swoon or
                  scowl or do anything strikingly dramatic.</p>
               <p>Prudence neither started nor fainted when she found John Dent with her uncle; she
                  had seen John Dent descend from the back at the gate ten or fifteen minutes
                  previously,—perhaps it gave her a turn at the instant,—and she had now come to
                  welcome him home. Nothing could have been more simple or natural than the meeting
                  between them. If Prudence's hand was a trifle cold, her hands were habitually
                  cold; if John Dent's hand was hot, he had a gunshot-wound, and was feverish.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you, Cousin John," said Prudence, simply, as if she had parted
                  with him yesterday, and had not eaten three thousand two hundred and eighty-five
                  meals since that day when he failed to come back to dinner.</p>
               <p>This is shockingly commonplace and realistic, I know, and will cost me a great
                  many sentimental readers; but I must stand or fall by the facts.</p>
               <p>Prudence was unaffectedly glad to see John Dent; and the sincere friendliness of
                  her greeting placed him at his ease. He had much to tell of his wanderings, and
                  much to be told of Rivermouth affairs; and very soon the conversation flowed on
                  between these three with only the slightest undercurrent of constraint. Indeed, it
                  seemed to Prudence like that first day, long ago, when John Dent came to
                  Rivermouth and surprised her by being a frank, light-hearted young fellow, instead
                  of the mousing Dryasdust she expected. As in that time also, he had come to remain
                  only a brief period; there were dragons still at large and giants yet unslain. As
                  soon as his arm was well, he would bid good by again to Rivermouth. The gold he
                  was going in quest of now was that small quantity of bullion which is to be found
                  in a lieutenant's shoulder-straps.</p>
               <p>The parallel between his two visits occurred to John Dent himself, as he sat there
                     chatting;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC5557-00000144"/> and so far as his
                  impecuniosity went, the parallel was too close to be agreeable. Before, he had had
                  only a slender outfit and a few hundred dollars; and now he was the possessor of a
                  navy revolver, and a suit of clothes which his uncle eyed thoughtfully from time
                  to time, and resolved to have buried in the back-garden at no remote period.</p>
               <p>But in spite of this, a blissful serenity, born of the home-like atmosphere he was
                  breathing, took possession of John Dent. His misfortunes were visions and
                  chimeras; he was as a man who, awaking from a nightmare, finds himself in a
                  comfortable warm room with the daylight pouring through the windows, and strives
                  in vain to recollect the dream that a moment ago appalled him.</p>
               <p>He looked so shabby, and uncared-for, and happy, that Prudence was touched. In
                  speaking of Parson Wibird, she was obliged to exert all her self-control not to
                  tell John Dent of the legacy. Whatever he did, he should not go away until he was
                  informed of that. She lingered on the subject of the parson's death, and came back
                  to it at intervals, with the hope that her guardian would be tempted to break
                  through the now slightly binding condition of the will. But the old parson
                  recalled to Mr. Dent's mind the new parson, and he broke out, with that fine tact
                  which characterized him, "By the way, Jack, you must know Dillingham; he's a
                  capital fellow."</p>
               <p>John Dent had learned from Wingate, in their hurried conference at the street
                  corner, that Prudence was still unmarried; and for the moment he had forgotten
                  everything save the delicious fact that he and Prue were sitting and talking
                  together as of old. But now his countenance fell.</p>
               <p>"I shall be glad to know him," he contrived to say, with more or less
                  enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>With this, Mr. Dillingham passed out of the conversation, and did not drift into
                  it again. No other unfortunate word or allusion ruffled the tranquillity of that
                  morning, which made way with itself so quickly that Fanny caused a sensation when
                  she announced dinner.</p>
               <p>The afternoon showed a similar suicidal tendency; and shortly after tea, John
                  Dent, who began to feel the reaction of the excitement<pb n="284-285"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000145"/> he had undergone, went to bed in the same room
                  where he had slept three years before.</p>
               <p>Apparently not a piece of the ancient mahogany furniture, which resolved itself,
                  wherever it was practicable, into carven claws grasping tarnished gilt balls, had
                  been moved since he was last there. It struck him, while undressing, that it would
                  be only the proper thing for him to go around the chamber and shake hands with all
                  the friendly old-fashioned paws,—they stretched themselves out from tables and
                  chairs and wardrobes with such a faithful, brute-like air of welcome.</p>
               <p>The castellated four-post bedstead, with its snowy dimity battlements, seemed an
                  incredible thing to John Dent; as he stood and looked at it in the weird winter
                  moonlight. It was many a month since he had lain in such a sumptuous affair.</p>
               <p>A sensuous calm stole over his limbs when he stretched himself on the pliant
                  springs of the mattress; then the impossible blue canaries, pecking at the green
                  roses on the wallpaper, lulled him to sleep, and would have hopped down from the
                  twigs and covered him with leaves, as the robins covered the babes in the wood, if
                  he had not been amply protected by a great silk patch-quilt, deftly done into
                  variegated squares and triangles by Prue's own fingers.</p>
               <p>He slept the sleep of the just that night; he was a failure, but he slept the
                  sleep of success; and his uncle, in the next room, dropped off with the soothing
                  reflection that events had proved his Wisdom in not telling Prue anything about
                  Colonel Peyton Todhunter; but Prudence scarcely slept at all.</p>
               <p>John Dent's wound was of the slightest, and the stiffness had nearly gone out of
                  his shoulder when he awoke the next morning. He awoke in the same state of
                  beatitude in which he had fallen asleep.</p>
               <p>"I know I don't amount to much when I'm added up," he said, smiling at himself in
                  the glass as if he enjoyed representing a very small vulgar fraction in the sum of
                  human happiness; "but I am not going to trouble myself about it any more. I'll go
                  down to Virginia, and come back presently with one leg and a pension, and spend
                  the rest of my days<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC5557-00000146"/> telling stories to
                  Prue's little ones." And John Dent sighed cheerfully as he pictured himself a
                  gray-haired, dilapidated captain, or maybe colonel, with two or three small
                  Dillinghams clinging to his coat-skirts.</p>
               <p>It was a singular coincidence that both uncle and nephew should have reached that
                  philosophical stage when they could look calmly on the prospect of playing
                  grandfather and godfather respectively to Prue's children.</p>
               <p>John Dent descended, and found Prudence and his uncle in the library, making a
                  pretty domestic picture, with the wood-fire blazing cheerily on the hearth,
                  lighting up the red damask curtains, and the snow outside dashing itself silently
                  in great feathery flakes against the windows. It was like an interior by Boughton,
                  with that glimpse of bleak winter at the casements.</p>
               <p>"Good morning," said John Dent, enveloping the pair in one voluminous smile.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Jack," returned Mr. Dent, and "Good morning, Cousin John," said
                  Prudence, who hurried off to see to breakfast, for the Prodigal was to have a
                  plate of those sublimated limated waffles of which only Prudence knew the secret.
                  The art of their composition was guarded at Willowbrook as the monks in the
                  Old-World convents guard the distillation of their famous cordials.</p>
               <p>The young man saw that he had interrupted a conversation between his uncle and
                  Prudence, and experienced that uncomfortable glow about the ears which comes over
                  one when the dialogue stops instantly at one's appearance.</p>
               <p>However, as Prudence departed to superintend the serving up of the fatted waffle,
                  John Dent drew a chair towards the fireplace and was about to seat himself, when
                  his eyes fell upon a small cabinet photograph which rested against a vase at one
                  end of the mantel-piece.</p>
               <p>The back of the chair slipped from John Dent's fingers, and he stood, transfixed
                  for a moment, looking at the picture; then he approached the mantel-shelf and took
                  the photograph in his hand.</p>
               <p>"Who is this? he asked quickly; and he pointed a quivering finger at the face.</p>
               <p>"That? why, that's my friend Dillingham, a cap—"</p>
               <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC5557-00000147"/>
               <p>"Dillingham be —!" cried John Dent. "That is George Nevins!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent leaned back in his chair and suppressed himself.</p>
               <p>"Quiet yourself," he said, soothingly. "You have n't slept well, you—"</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose I don't know that face!"</p>
               <p>"That is just precisely what I suppose," cried Mr. Dent, giving way to his
                  irritation, "and I could n't have expressed it better."</p>
               <p>"Not know it! Have n't I thought of it every day for two years, fallen asleep
                  thinking of it every night, dreamed of it a thousand times? He has cut his
                  mustache and beard," said John Dent slowly and to himself, "and wears no collar to
                  his coat. What—what is this doing <emph>here</emph>?" he cried, with sudden
                  fury.</p>
               <p>"Why, Jack, my boy, I tell you that that is the Rev. James Dillingham, the pastor
                  of the Old Brick Church, Prue's friend and mine."</p>
               <p>"You can't mean it!"</p>
               <p>"Don't be an idiot. If you discover any resemblance to Colonel Todhunter in that
                  picture, you've a fine eye for resemblance."</p>
               <p>"Todhunter was not the man," cried John Dent. "<emph>This</emph> is the man!"</p>
               <p>It was patent now to Mr. Dent that his nephew was a monomaniac on the subject of
                  George Nevins. First it had been Colonel Todhunter, now it was Dillingham, and by
                  and by it would be somebody else, Prue or himself possibly. Mr. Dent coughed, and
                  restrained the impatient words that rose to his lips. The boy's mind was turned by
                  his misfortunes, and yet he seemed rational enough on other topics.</p>
               <p>"You think I am crazy?" said the young man, reading his uncle's open countenance
                  as if it were a book. "Well, I am not. I am as sane as you are, and as clear in
                  the head as a bell. How long has your friend Mr. Dillingham been settled over the
                  Brick Church?" And John Dent seated himself, crossing his legs comfortably, with
                  the aspect of a man who is going to take things philosophically and not fret
                  himself about trifles.</p>
               <p>"Since last June," returned Mr. Dent, relieved to see his nephew calm again.
                  "Dillingham came here in the latter part of May, and it is now December.
                  Consequently he has been here a little over six months."</p>
               <p>"While I was at Shasta," muttered the<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC5557-00000148"/>
                  young man. "But who fired on me in Virginia, if it was n't Nevins?" Then in a
                  negligent way to his uncle, "Where does your friend Dillingham live?"</p>
               <p>"In Rivermouth, of course."</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"At the Old Bell Tavern."</p>
               <p>John Dent went out of the room like a flash.</p>
               <p>After an instant of panic, Mr. Dent dashed after him. The hall door was locked and
                  bolted; there was a complicated bolt with a chain, and the young man was tugging
                  at the chain when his uncle seized him by the arm.</p>
               <p>"What are you trying to do?"</p>
               <p>"I must see this man Dillingham, Uncle Ralph."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, so you shall see Dillingham. Ten to one he will ride out here before
                  the morning is over, in spite of the storm; and then you will discover how absurd
                  you are."</p>
               <p>"Granting I am wrong," said John Dent as composedly as he could, "I cannot wait to
                  have proof of it. If he is the man I think he is, he knows where I am by this
                  time, and will not show his face here. I must go to him."</p>
               <p>"Before breakfast?"</p>
               <p>"This instant!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent reflected that perhaps the only cure for his nephew's delusion was to
                  bring him face to face with the young minister, whom, by the way, Mr. Dent himself
                  was anxious to see; he was still ignorant of what had passed in the drawing-room
                  two nights previously, for Prudence had found no fitting moment since John Dent's
                  arrival to inform her guardian of her decision and the letter she had written to
                  Mr. Dillingham.</p>
               <p>So one of the carriage horses was ordered to be harnessed to the buggy and driven
                  around to the side door. Meanwhile John Dent paced the hall chafing; and Prudence,
                  with her eyebrows raised into interrogation-points, stood behind the coffee-urn in
                  the breakfast-room, wondering what it all meant.</p>
               <p>When the buggy was ready, Mr. Dent proposed to go to town alone and bring the
                  young minister back with him; but John Dent would not listen to the suggestion,
                  and the two drove off together in the storm.</p>
               <p>The snow beat so persistently in their faces<pb n="292-293"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000149"/> all the way, that there was no chance for
                  conversation, if either had been disposed, to talk. Mr. Dent stole a glance now
                  and then at the young man, whose eyes glowed wickedly over a huge white mustache
                  which he had got riding in the teeth of the wind. "I've half a mind to tip the
                  pair of us over the next bank," muttered Mr. Dent; "he's as crazy as a loon!"</p>
               <p>On driving up to the door of the Old Bell Tavern, Mr. Dent begged his nephew to
                  control himself and do nothing rash. John Dent promised this, but with set teeth
                  and in a manner not reassuring.</p>
               <p>"You are making a dreadful mistake; and if you involve me in any absurdity I'll
                  never forgive you. Dillingham is my friend, and one of the noblest fellows in the
                  world. It is rather early for a call, I'll go up first, Jack."</p>
               <p>"And I'll go with you," said John Dent with disgusting promptness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham's suite of rooms was on the second floor, and the door of his
                  parlor or study gave upon the main staircase. Mr. Dent, inwardly consigning his
                  nephew to the shades below, knocked two or three times without awakening the
                  well-known voice which always said "come in" to his recognized knock; then he
                  turned the handle of the door which was not fastened.</p>
               <p>"He's in bed at this hour, of course," he remarked. The town clock was striking
                  eight. "We'll step into his parlor and wait for him."</p>
               <p>The room was in the greatest disorder; the drawers of a large escritoire between
                  the windows were standing wide open, the grate was full of dead ashes, and over
                  the carpet everywhere were scattered half-torn letters and papers. John Dent cast
                  one glance around the apartment, and then rushed into the small bed-chamber
                  adjoining. The bed was unrumpled.</p>
               <p>"Gone!" moaned John Dent, dropping into a chair.</p>
               <p>"Gone? nonsense. Gone to breakfast," said Mr. Dent.</p>
               <p>"It's no use," said the young man, settling himself gloomily in the chair; "he is
                  hundreds of miles away by this time. While we were sitting in the chimney-corner
                  over yonder, fire and steam and all infernal powers were whisking him off beyond
                  my reach."</p>
               <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC5557-00000150"/>
               <p>Mr. Dent pulled at the bell-cord as if he had suddenly had a bite, and jerked in
                  Larkin the waiter. Where was Mr. Dillingham? Larkin did not know where Mr.
                  Dillingham was. He would inquire at the office.</p>
               <p>He returned shortly with the information that Mr. Dillingham had gone out quite
                  early the day before, and had not been in since. The young minister was in the
                  habit of absenting himself for several days together without notifying the
                  office-clerk, who supposed in this instance, as in the others, that Mr. Dillingham
                  was visiting his friend Mr. Dent at Willowbrook.</p>
               <p>"That'll do, Larkin," said Mr. Dent. "Nothing particular. We'll look in
                  again."</p>
               <p>Exit Larkin, lined with profanity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent, with a feeble smile on his lips, stood looking at his nephew.</p>
               <p>"It is too late," said the young man, "but I would like to send a telegram to
                  Boston and one to New York."</p>
               <p>"To whom?"</p>
               <p>"To the chief of police."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent started. "Don't you do it! I know you are wrong, though I acknowledge
                  that the thing has a strange look. You would feel rather flat if, after you had
                  sent off a couple of libellous messages, Dillingham should turn up and explain it
                  all in a dozen words, as I am positive he will. I could never look him in the face
                  again."</p>
               <p>"You won't, any way," said John Dent. "However, I don't want to use the name of
                  Dillingham in the matter. I shall simply give a description of the person of
                  George Nevins. That will not inconvenience any one, I'm afraid. See how he slips
                  through my fingers! I should call the man an eel, if he was n't a devil."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent made no further objection; the two descended to the street and drove to
                  the telegraph-office.</p>
               <p>In the midst of writing a despatch, young Dent paused and nibbled the top of the
                  penholder. "I wonder I did n't think of that before," he said to himself; and then
                  in a low voice to his uncle, "Ask the operator if Dillingham has sent or received
                  anything over the wires lately."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham had sent two telegrams the day before.</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5557-00000151"/>
               <p>"Will you allow me to look at them a moment?"</p>
               <p>Knowing Mr. Dent to be the intimate friend of the young pastor, the clerk
                  obligingly took the copies of the two despatches from a clip on his desk and
                  handed them to the elderly gentleman.</p>
               <p>Dropping the date, the telegrams read as follows: <q>

               <p>"Are you convinced now?" whispered John Dent, having with breathless interest read
                  these documents over his uncle's shoulder. "It appears pears, though I don't
                  understand the last telegram at all, that your friend Colonel Peyton Todhunter is
                  the friend of your worthy friend the Rev. James Dillingham; and a precious pair
                  they are, if I may say so without hurting your feelings. 'He is here' means me of
                  course; but what is meant by 'You have failed'? '6666' evidently designates some
                  point of rendezvous."</p>
               <p>"Jack," whispered Mr. Dent thickly, "I can't believe my eyes!"</p>
               <p>"I would n't, said Jack. "I'd stand it out. In the mean time I will send off this
                  description, and then we'll go back to the hotel. He decamped in haste, and may
                  have left behind him something in the way of letters or papers that will be useful
                  to me."</p>
               <p>The young man seated himself at a desk, and, after a moment's reflection, wrote
                  the following message, which he handed to his uncle:— <q>

               <p>"That's a clever idea," said Mr. Dent, awaking from the stupor that lad fallen
                  upon him. "We will have an injunction on them, if it is not too late; but is n't
                  it a sort of forgery to use Dillingham's name this way?"</p>
               <p>"I have n't used his name," answered Jack, laughing; "I have put my own initials
                  to the document, like a man. Are you working through?" he asked, turning to the
                  clerk. "Then send this along."</p>
               <p>He resumed his seat at the desk, and fell to work on a personal description of
                  George Nevins. This was a task of some difficulty, requiring a conciseness and
                  clearness of diction which cost him considerable trouble. More than half an hour
                  elapsed before John Dent had completed the portrait to his satisfaction. He was in
                  the midst of his second despatch, when the operator received from Rawlings &amp;
                  Son a telegram that seemed to puzzle him somewhat.</p>
               <p>"This appears to be an answer to your despatch, sir, but it is addressed to Mr.
                  Dillingham."</p>
               <p>"A mistake at the other end," said Mr. Dent, quickly.</p>
               <p>"What do they say?" asked John Dent, reaching forward to take the long narrow
                  strip of paper from the clerk's hand.</p>
               <p>Colonel Todhunter had drawn out the funds in full. The Messrs. Rawlings &amp; Son
                  trusted there was nothing wrong in the matter; they had acted strictly according
                  to instructions.</p>
               <p>"Just as I expected," said Jack, tossing the paper to his uncle, "luck is dead
                  against me."</p>
               <p>Then he went on with his writing: "Five feet eight or nine inches; blue eyes;
                  light hair, probably cut close; no beard or mustache," etc., etc.</p>
               <p>"This is simply horrible," murmured Mr. Dent; and as he walked nervously up and
                  down the office, he recalled the afternoon when he introduced Dillingham to
                  Colonel Todhunter, and how they had saluted each other as strangers, and seemed to
                  dislike each other, being such different men; then he reflected that it was
                  chiefly through his own means that this scandal had been brought upon Rivermouth;
                  then he thought of Prue, and he turned cold and hot, and pale and flushed, by
                  turns; and the rapid scratching of John Dent's pen over<pb n="300-301"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000153"/> the paper, and the monotonous clicking of the
                  satanic little telegraph instrument behind the wire screen, drove him nearly
                  distracted.</p>
               <p>"And now, if you please, we will inspect the sanctum sanctorum of the late
                  incumbent," said John Dent gayly.</p>
               <p>It was only human that he should relish the consternation of his uncle. But as
                  they were passing out into the street, John Dent's face underwent a change; he
                  halted on the last of the three steps leading to the sidewalk, and, grasping the
                  iron railing, seemed unable to move further.</p>
               <p>"What is it now?" asked Mr. Dent, nervously.</p>
               <p>"Uncle Ralph, was Prue engaged to that man?—did she love him?"</p>
               <p>"No!" cried Mr. Dent; "I believe she hated him instinctively,—thank God!"</p>
               <p>"Amen!" said John Dent, drawing a long breath. "He has got my money, he has
                  blighted two years of my life, but if he has n't got at the pure gold of Prue's
                  heart, I forgive him!"</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>THE two Dents returned in silence to the Old Bell Tavern, and went
                  up directly to the deserted study.</p>
               <p>"First of all," said John Dent, closing the door and turning the key, "I want to
                  know how he came here, how he managed to step into Parson Hawkins's shoes, and all
                  the details. Tell me slowly, for I feel I shall not comprehend this thing, unless
                  it is put in the simplest way."</p>
               <p>The story of Mr. Dent's acquaintance with Dillingham in New York, and the chain of
                  commonplace events that had ended in his coming to Rivermouth as the pastor of the
                  Old Brick Church, was told in a few words. It was not a strange story, taking it
                  link by link; it was only as a whole that it appeared incredible.</p>
               <p>"He was an artist, that man," said Mr. Dent,<pb n="302-303"
                     xml:id="VAC5557-00000154"/> with an involuntary pang of admiration, as he
                  recalled the cleverness with which Dillingham had put Joseph Twombly out of the
                  way. He recollected now that Dillingham had withheld his consent to come to
                  Rivermouth until the very day Twombly started for Chicago. "Ah, Jack, if good
                  people, as a class, were one half as intelligent and energetic as rogues, what a
                  world this would be!"</p>
               <p>"Knowing Nevins as I do," said John Dent when his uncle had finished, "his
                  adroitness and cunning, I can understand what a tempting thing it was to him to
                  play at this masquerade; but he must have had a deeper motive than a mere whim to
                  keep him here seven months."</p>
               <p>"He fell in love with Prue, of course," said Mr. Dent, with a twinge; "and then— I
                  see it all, Jack! you were right. He <emph>did</emph> have a watch set on you; he
                  meant to marry Prue, and keep you out of the parson's money, even if he had to
                  kill you to do it!—it was Todhunter who made the attempt on your life when they
                  saw you were coming East; it was Todhunter who dogged your steps all the
                  time!"</p>
               <p>"The parson's money?" said John Dent.</p>
               <p>The words had escaped Mr. Dent in his excitement, as the whole of the desperate
                  game which Dillingham had probably been playing flashed upon him. It will be
                  remembered that on the morning when Parson Hawkins's later will was found, Mr.
                  Dent went to Boston to meet Mr. Dillingham and conduct him to Rivermouth. Mr. Dent
                  was full of the matter, and that night, at the Revere House, he had spoken freely
                  to his friend of the old parson's whimsical testament. Perhaps it was in that same
                  hour Dillingham formed the purpose to possess himself of the money,—admitting, for
                  the moment, that Dillingham was George Nevins.</p>
               <p>John Dent stood looking inquiringly at his uncle. It was too late to recall the
                  words; the circumstances seemed to warrant Mr. Dent now in disregarding the
                  restriction of the will, and he told his nephew of the legacy.</p>
               <p>At another moment, this undreamed-of fortune would have filled John Dent's heart
                  with both joy and sadness; but the day, scarcely begun, had been too crowded with
                  other emotions, for him to give way to either now. He walked to the window and,
                  rubbing a clear space on one<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC5557-00000155"/> of the
                  panes, looked out into the snowy street for several minutes; then he turned to Mr.
                  Dent and said quietly, "Let us look through these things."</p>
               <p>A closer examination of the study and sleeping-room afforded indubitable evidence
                  that the late occupant had abandoned them in desperate haste, but also that he had
                  left behind him no letters or written memoranda giving any clew to his intended
                  movements. A quantity of papers had been burnt in the grate; an undecipherable
                  fragment of the note Prudence had written him lay on the hearth-rug, and near it
                  the back of a delicate pink envelope with which no one would have thought of
                  associating the fair Veronica, if it had not borne her pretty monogram.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dillingham had, so to speak, spiked his guns; but a company of embroidered
                  worsted slippers,—as gay as a company of Zouaves,—and a number of highly mounted
                  dressing-gowns sufficient-properly to officer this metaphorical detachment, fell
                  into the hands of the enemy.</p>
               <p>The younger man, on his side, conducted the investigation with relentless
                  scrutiny; but Mr. Dent only cursorily, for the place in his heart which Dillingham
                  had occupied was yet warm with the late presence.</p>
               <p>Two discoveries were made, unimportant in themselves, but one of which interested
                  the nephew, and the other startled the uncle, who, in the progress of the search,
                  appeared to be receiving a series of shocks from an invisible galvanic
                  battery.</p>
               <p>"Here's a photograph which was lost some time since with a certain pocket-book
                  containing a small sum of money"; and John Dent held out at arm's length a faded
                  vignette head of Prudence, gazing at it thoughtfully. "The finder would have been
                  liberally rewarded if I had got hold of him. Hullo! what's this? Somebody's
                  bracelet," he added, fishing up a piece of jewelry from the depths of the
                  travelling-trunk over which he was stooping.</p>
               <p>"Dear, dear!" groaned Mr. Dent. It was Veronica Blydenburgh's bracelet. He knew of
                  its loss; everybody knew of it. You could no more lose a bracelet in Rivermouth
                  without everybody knowing it than you could lose your head.</p>
               <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC5557-00000156"/>
               <p>This affair seemed blacker to Mr. Dent than all the rest,—blacker than the attempt
                  on Jack's life, inasmuch as petty larceny lacks the dignity of assassination. But
                  I fancy Mr. Dent was a trifle uncharitable here. As a reminiscence of a lovely
                  white wrist, the trinket may have had a value to Mr. Dillingham which Mr. Dent did
                  not suspect.</p>
               <p>"What a finished rogue he was! It is only when a man adds hypocrisy to his
                  rascality, that he becomes a perfect knave."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said John Dent, "that little lamb's-skin does aggravate the offence."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent walked off, to the other end of the room and began turning over a lot of
                  books and pamphlets piled in one corner.</p>
               <p>"Look here, Jack!" he cried presently, "here is where he got his sermons
                  from,—'South's Sermons,' 'Robertson's Sermons,' 'Hooker's Sermons,' 'Cumming's
                  Great Tribulation,' 'Peabody's Discourses.' Gad! he mixed them up, old and young.
                  By heaven! here's the very passage Prue thought so affecting Fast Day. See where
                  he's changed 'London' into <hi rend="i"/>Rivermouth, and 'our Gracious Queen' into
                     <hi rend="i"/>our honored Chief Executive. Jack," said Mr. Dent, solemnly, "let
                  us go home!"</p>
               <p>"Uncle Ralph, that is almost the only rational suggestion you have made to-day. I
                  am famished."</p>
               <p>"And I am frozen," said Mr. Dent with a shiver, picking up his overcoat. He drew
                  on one sleeve, and paused.</p>
               <p>"Well?" said his nephew.</p>
               <p>"Jack, this thing must be hushed up, for Prue's sake. The deacons will have to
                  know the truth, and maybe one or two outsiders; but the towns-people must never be
                  allowed to suspect the real character of that man. Some plausible explanation of
                  his flight must be circulated. If he has left any bills," continued Mr. Dent, with
                  an unconscious grimace, "I shall pay them. I cannot cat a mouthful until this is
                  settled. I must see Blydenburgh and Twombly and Wendell without wasting a moment,
                  and I want you to come with me."</p>
               <p>"For Prue's sake, and for your sake," said John Dent, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Yes, for my sake too. Don't be hard on a fallen brother. You can't afford to,
                     Jack.<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC5557-00000157"/> If Dillingham deceived me,
                  George Nevins was too many for you."</p>
               <p>"That's a fact," said John Dent.</p>
               <p>In the course of an hour the deacons and trustees of the Old Brick Church
                  assembled together mysteriously in Deacon Twombly's parlor,—five or six honest,
                  elderly, bald-headed gentlemen, who now had the air of dark-browed conspirators on
                  the eve of touching off innumerable barrels of gunpowder. Deacon Zeb Twombly might
                  have been taken for Guy Fawkes himself.</p>
               <p>The next day it was known that the Rev. Mr. Dillingham had quitted Rivermouth; it
                  was understood in the parish and in the town that family matters, involving the
                  jeopardy of large estates, had called Mr. Dillingham away so suddenly that he had
                  had time to advise only his immediate friends of his departure. It was also
                  understood that his return was problematical. There were dark hints and whispers
                  and rumors and speculations, to be sure; but for once a secret was kept in
                  Rivermouth,—though one woman knew it!</p>
               <p>Prudence had to be told, of course, and she nearly died with desire one afternoon,
                  six months afterwards, to tell Veronica Blydenburgh everything,—the afternoon
                  Veronica came to her and said,</p>
               <p>"Only think, Prue, papa found my opal bracelet under the flooring of the old
                  summer-house."</p>
               <p>Veronica sat silent for a moment, dreamily weaving the bright coil in and out her
                  slender fingers; then suddenly lifting her head, she cried,</p>
               <p>"Prue, will you swear never to breathe it to a living soul if I tell you
                  something?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Prudence, with a start.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, the afternoon before he went away so strangely—"</p>
               <p>"Who went away?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Dillingham."</p>
               <p>"Oh!"</p>
               <p>"The afternoon before he went away, he—he offered himself to me."</p>
               <p>"What!" cried Prudence, turning white and red. It was beginning to appear that
                  Cupid had had two strings to his bow.</p>
               <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC5557-00000158"/>
               <p>"I say," repeated Veronica, "that Mr. Dillingham offered himself to me."</p>
               <p>"And you refused him!"</p>
               <p>"O Prue! that's the bitterness of it!—I accepted him!"</p>
               <p>I have not said—though I have let John Dent say it—that the Rev. James Dillingham
                  was George Nevins. Is it improbable? As I come to the close of my story, I have a
                  feeling that the career of James Dillingham in Rivermouth, supposing him to be
                  identical with George Nevins, will strike the reader as improbable, and it
                     <emph>is</emph> improbable—as the things that happen every day. But such as it
                  is, the chronicle ends here.</p>
               <p>And Prudence Palfrey?</p>
               <p>The reader shall become my collaborator at this point and finish the romance to
                  his own liking. It is only fair for me to inform him, however, that one morning
                  last spring as I was passing, portmanteau in hand, from the station at Rivermouth
                  to the old gambrel-roofed house in a neighboring street where I always find
                  welcome, I saw a little man swinging on a gate.</p>
               <p>I had never seen this small personage before, but there was something absurdly
                  familiar in the dark hair and alert black eyes, something absurdly familiar in the
                  lithe, wiry figure (it was as if John Dent had been cut down from five feet eight
                  to three feet four); and when he returned my salutation with that cavalier air
                  which stamps your six-year-old man of the world, there was an intonation in his
                  voice so curiously like Prue's, that I laughed all to myself!</p>
