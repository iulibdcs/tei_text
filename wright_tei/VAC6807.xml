PHLADELPHA: PUBLISHED BY E. E. BARCLAY, 283 MARKET ST. 1852.    <pb n="0" xml:id="VAC6807-00000002"/> Entered according to the Act of Congress, in the year 185!, by T. DONLON MA. WALTER, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the East- ern District of Pennsylvania.   C ONFESSION OF "ET not the evil doer or tl the ii.1l'oF thittk that his deeds willl l for ever concealed. ]or more tlhan clcc! yeats I have dealt in the lor ibie occupation of murder anfl' robbery, and at last, having gatlhered together enough to satisfy my bloody :avarice, I must leav e it all, and ang like a dog on the scaffold. Such is the way of retributive justice But had I ten lives they would not be suf- fiient to atone for those I have taken, and the cruelty-barbarous cruelty--I inlflicted upon iy unoffending wife and lhelpless chil- dren. But I hope this confession will clear her in the eyes of the law from any share in my actions' for her hands are clear of the blood of her fellow-creatures, save the poor girl whose life I obliged her to take or see her own child killed before her eyes; for so re- morseless and cruel had I become, that I would have killed the child, had she not done so. I bade her. But the hours are flying fast away, and the few that are left warn me to confess every dark deed of my life, before I cutor the prese nce of an offended God. Perhaps my confession may be a warning to others never to dis- regard the advice of their parents, and by that man's shun the road which leads to death and destruction. I am the son of a farmer in the neighbourhood of Cincinnati, in the thriving state of Ohio. When about the age of eighteen I ran away firom my parents, and went to the city. I was tired of a country life, and wearied of its continuall  mdnotony. The excite- ment and never-ending variety of life in- a large and densely popu- lated city were the svren allurements which enticed me from my peaceful tome.  Having never lived out of the country, I was an inexperienced youth, knowing nothing of the temptations of the world. I launched without rudder or compass into the vortex of a city life, and be- came, in the course of a year or two, one of its most depraved youths. My parents vainly endeavoured to reclaim me. I resist- ed all their entreaties, and plunged deeper and deeper in the abyss of vice and infamy; till at last, wearied, dispirited, and heart-bro- ken, they left me to myself, mourning in the bitterness of their spirlit the dcay and the hour of my birth.    <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6807-00000003"/> (6) Abont three years after I left my home, I connected myself with a gang of counterfeiters. Wishing to visit the eastern cities, I took a package of the spurious notes with me, and took passage for Philadelphia, passing myself off as a western merchant. IIaving forged a number of letters of introduction to some of the first families in the city, and possessing a fine form and pleasing address, which I had cultivated to the utmost extent, I was aad- mitted without any reserve into what is called the best society. I was an honoured guest at Judge B.'s, alwarvs welcome to his house -not a breath of suspicion concerning my real character crossed his mind while I remained in the city. he was- an old bachelor, and the uncle of a very engaging young lady, who superintendedl his domestic affairs. She was what the world in truth would call very beautiful. She was amiable and lovely in her disposition, kind to all and loved by every one around her. I contrived, by every means in my power, to become acquainted with her, and at last succeeded. I won her heart. She had been sought by many respectable young men; but she refused them all, to become the wife of a burglar and counterfeiter. Such is fate. I gained the consent of her friends to our marriage, and they, of course, inquired into my circumstances and my means of sup- porting a wife. I showed them the title deeds to an extensive estate near Cincinnati, (forged, of course,) which they believed; and I became the husband of the beautiful Emma Moren. My packages of notes by this time were nearly all passed, and it was quite convenient for me to return to the west with my bride. We took passage for Pittsburgh, where I passed the remainder. When we arrived at Cincinnati, I rented a house, and furnished it in fine style, giving, as an excuse for this, that it would be ra- ther dull in the country at this season of the year. She was per- fectly satisfied with this, living in happy ignorance of the calling of her husband, I was kind to her, for the ferocity of my disposition was not yet manifested. Alas, it displayed itself too soon, to her cost! But as yet my love had not diminished, .and that was the cause of the first blood shed by my hands. While engaged in counterfeiting  one day, in a cellar under ground, I got into a dispute with a young nan who was of a very fiery temper and stubborn disposition. In the heat of our quarrel, he threatened to tell my wife of my occu- pation. He had visited at our house, and seen that she had been duped and deceived. The disclosure would have killed her; and in the fear that; he would inform her, I seized a bar of iron, and struck him on the head with it-it killed him instantly. When 1 saw that he was dead, my feelings underwent a fearful change,- it seemed as though all that was diabolical in my nature was throwa up to the surface, and I even smiled when I looked on the pale, ghastly face of my victim, We buried him in the cellar, and through   (7) the connivance of my companions I escaped; for had they said any thing about the murder, it would have brought on unpleasant in- quiries from the authorities. And there the murdered man lay, and the murderer worked over his grave without one pang of re- morse. About this time one of the gang had passed some coun- terfeit money, and had been detected, and committed to prison. On the trial, he revealed the secret of the cellar, and we were obliged to decamp with all speed. I flew to the wharf, and engaged a passage for New Orleans; then returned, and hurried my wife on board, under the plea of urgent business. We arrived in New Or- leans in the course of a week, where I joined myself to another gang, of worthies like myself. My wife had often written to her friends in Philadelphia, and they as often requested to. know, in their letters, how she liked her country residence in Ohio. This she was unable to answer, nor could she give a sufficient reason for not doing so; and, having mentioned. in one of her letters, that she was in New Orleans, andl the hurry in which we had to depart from Cincinnati, suspicion was aroused ini the minds of her friends, which they communicated to her in their next letter. One day I came in, and found her in tears, reading a letter she held in her hand. She started, and, endeavoured to hide the let- ter from me. "What is the matter, my dear?" I said; "are any of your friends dead?" "No," she said, "they are all well." "Then why are you in tears?" "Oh, it is nothing; it will soon be over." "But there must be something, or you would not be crying," I continued. "Is there any unpleasant news in that letter?" "None concerning my friiends," she said. "Will you please to let me see it," I said,-at the samnatime extending my hand for the letter. No, William, you cannot see this letter. I was only weeping at fancied sorrows, and I do not wish to trouble you with such trifles." "Let me see the letter," I exclaimed, while my face grew livid with rage. She trembled from head to foot, and handed me the letter with- out a, word. That was the first instance, since our marriage, in which I bad spoken unkindly to her. I took the letter,-it was from her uncle. It contained some excellent advice and wishes for our welfare; but at the bottom was this postscript:-  "I do not wish to distress or make you uneasy, but it is for your own welfare, my child, that I speak in this strain; but I have heard, some very unpleasant whisperings about your husband lately.     <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6807-00000004"/> (8) As for his estate in Ohio, he does notpossess one foot of land in all the length and breadth of the state. But that were nothing, if it were the worst we could say of him; yet perhaps, with your kind- ness and good example before his eyes; he may reform. Do your best to keep him from bad company; but if that should have no effect, and his behaviour change from the loving and kind husband ]ie has been to you all along, come to the arms of your friends ;- they will protect you while they have a breath ini their body, or a. cent in their pocket." I looked at my wife when I had finished roading: she was sitting on the sofa, bathed in t she. I said notsofing to er, bathed ai the  letter on the centre table, took my hat, and went out. I strolled downm a street or two, thinking how, I should answer her queries, if she should ask me any when I returned. 1 stopped at the wharf;, and was looking at the water, 'when a young man came up to me, and, slapping me familiarly on the shoulder, said, gaily, "There are some fine fish to be caught if you will lend a hand in the catching them."  "What is it "' I asked.  "Returned Californians. flush with gold and whiskey.'  "Is the net spread?" "Yes' "Where?" I inquired. "At the lied Lion;" meaning a tavern in a street of very ill repute. I accompanied him to the place. There were, three young men there, who had just landed fresh from California. They were drink- ing freely, and made a great display of their gold, which taken al- togother, would have made a considerable pile of gold dust. They were surrounded by a number of gamblers and sharpers, who were busily plying them with liquor, in order to make them the more easily their prey. But one of the three, a stout young fellow, was, not so easily blinded ; he refused to drink, and stoutly insisted that his comnrades should have no more drink, but sh6uld instantly leave along with him. This the sharpers were determined they s]hould not do, and the young man getting more noisy and clamorous, they purposed to get rid of him. Two were sent to engage his atten- tion by gambling, while they conveyed the others to a more se- cure place, to cnomplete their robbery. But in this they failed. The young man, seeing their intention, broke away fromt them, lnd stood by the side of his friends, and again urged them. to leave, and would not allow them to bo wronged, nor to drink any more liquor; and called aloud once or twice for the police. At last a plan was, hit upon, by a big, burly gambler, that soon silenced the poor young follow, and that for ever. At the second   (9) call for the police, he marched up to him, and asked him what. he was bawling for. This was answered by a blow from the young man,--preecisely what they wanted. A fight ensued, and the blood of the Californian flew over the bystanders. I got more than the rest, for the sleeves of my coat amnd'my hands were literally drenched. During, the fight the others were robbed, and when the police on- teredw escaped by a back door, leaving. the body of the mur- dered man to thicr care. I went home, forgetting the blood on my clothes. I sought my. wife's apartment; she cast her eyes on my hands, and turned very pale. "William," she said, in a nervous voice,. "your hands and your clothes are covered with blood!" "Pshaw!" said I, turning round with a laugh, " a couple of hot- headed young men got to fighting, and in separating them, I gob this blood on my hands and clothes." She said no more. A few days after, the papers contained an account of the murder. I was not aware that I had been seen by the police; but a full description of me was given, and a reward oF- fered for my apprehension. 'She placed this piece before nme, and watched me narrowly while I read it. The colour left my face, and I clutched the paper with' a nervous grasp. When I looked up, her eyes were fixed full on me. I started up in' anger. "Why 'do you look at me so intently?"I said, in a rage, " as if you thought this humbug piece alluded ,to me."' "Is it not a perfect description of you!" she replied. 'What of that?"I said, ",is there no person in the world that I mighit resemble so closely as to be taken -for the' same person,-- especially at night?" "Yes, many a one, but,' and she stopped, embarrassed. "But what?"I asked. "It was the same night you came home with your hands and clothes bloody." "You have a good memory, madam," I answmcedc; "and I pre-. sume the next letter you' write to your uncle will go laden with the news." At this taunt, she fixed her full, dark eye upon me, and rising, she laid her hand on my arm. "William," she said' "is not my uncle's suspicion just? Are you not worse than he said?" With an oath, I flung her from me, and as she fell I kicked her.. My reason returned when I saw her lying pale and insensible before, me. For an hour I strove to restore her, but in vain:--she was dead, and I was her murderer. Oh, what a revulsion of feeling 'I experienced then! I would have given worlds, nay, my very heart's blood, if I could have brought life ba:ck to those pale lips. In agony of mind, beyol;dl description, I paced the room with the stiffening form of my wife stretched at my feet.    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6807-00000005"/> (10)             f As evening closed, I stooped down and imprinted a kiss on the cold forehead and the death-coloured lips, and locking the door, I threw away the key, and fled from New Orleans up the Mississippi, I knew pursuit would be hot after me; so, the better to elude de- tcetion, I struck into the interior of Illinois. 'I changed m:ry fine broadcloth for rough country clothing, and etigaged with1 a -farmerl1i for ten dollars a month and my board. My Ihatnds were rather de- licate, but I bronzed them over with some 'paint that would not wash off, and I becamne once more a farmer.  The fanrer I worked for lived not far friom the house of Mr. r Calrick, whose daughter afterwards becamie my second wife, and  who is now in prison. She was beautiful, but not so lovely as Emma. Her people were strict Presbyterians, and her father was  a hard-hearted, selfish man. I knew that, when I woln Mary for my wife it would be of no use. to ask his consent: I was a stranger to him, and I saw, by his glances at times, that he did not like my i looks. My only chance of meeting with Mary was on Sundays, or at  quilting bees, and I urged my suit with so much addiess that in a  short time we were married. After her expulsion froln her father's roof, accompanied witl the most bitter invectives against me,-- which I vowed lie would repent of, we lived very happily together  for some time; but my former companions finding me out, althoughl  I wished to reform, and pass the remainder of my life in honesty, I fell into the wicked practices of my former life. They supplied me with a number of counterfeit bank notes, which I passed among the country people as oftetn as opportunity afforded. I had been  urged repeatedly, by several of the gang, to go to the Rocky  Mountains, and. waylay te travlelers to and from California, but  had not yielded to their request, till having attempted to pass a note on a store keeper, who, being a judge of money, saw in-  stantly that it was not good. ' "fIow many of these have you got?" said he, looking at the norte "None but the one," I said, with as much coolness as possible. 'And where did you e-t th is?" he asked. I saw he suspected me, and repli ed readily, that it was given me in change of a la rger bill soine time ago, and that I had not had  occasion to spend it till now. "Are you telling me the truth?" he said. "Certainly, I am," I replied. "I don't believe you." "Well, if you don't believe me, give me'back the bill." "I sha'n't do that either," said he, coolly. "You wo'n't?" said I, savagely. "No," I replied, in a determined manner. A heavy hammer lay on! the counter; I seized it, and with one stroke, sunk it in his skull. I clutched the note, and ran from the shop to my home, where I made preparations for instant de- l   * (11  parture. It was fortunate for me that no one saw me enter or leave the store, so that I left the settlement without suspicion. A valley in the Rocky Mountains was appointed for the rendez- vous, and a number of the gang awaited us at the mouth of the Missouri. We built a few huts in the most secet part of tlhe valley, and then commenced our depredations. We had but little chance of surprising the travellers, as they generally went in large companies, but we contrived' to steal a horse now and then. I had by this time become a perfect fiend, and we seldom went on an expedition that blood was not shed before we returned. On one of these expeditions, we happened to surprise a party of three young men; they were gazing with delight on'the wild beauty of a water-fall that dashed down the side of a rock into the valley. We called to them to suirrender, and give up their money, or we would shoot them down. A volley from their pistols was the an- swer we received. It had no effect further than slightly wounding one or two. They immediately scampered off; I fired at random, and one of the three fell'from his horse, and the animal rushed across the plain. I ran up to the wounded man, and drawing my knife I cut his head almost off. - He had a money belt well filled about his person, but before we could take it from the body, we heard the holloa of the company as they came dashing across the plain to the support of their comrades. We thrust the body in a sack, and flinging it across a horse, we made for the huts. The fiend of darkness rose in my bosom when I reached home, and flung the body on the floor. The children were starving, and I deliberately cut a piece from the dead man, and gave it them for food. My wife's innocence mortified and annoyed, me, and, to make her as guilty as myself, I caused her to murder tl hat poor girl, after I had taken the life of her aged parents. It was an atrocious. act on my part, and, for some time after, I was afraid she would lose her, reason. Our band being broken up by the hot pursuit made after us, I joined myself to a tribe of Indians, who robbed and plundered whenever they could do so with impuntity. Here I fell in love with Raven-Eye, a beautiful Indian girl, the betrothed of a noble young warrior. She was very lovely, and had a form of the most ex- quisite natural grace. I loved her madly, and wished to take her to the settlements when I had gained her love-leaving my wife and children to the tender mercies of the Indians, if I succeeded in my design. I forgot that when in pain and sickness she nursed me with care and kindness, even' after the horrible deed I made her commit; but this was all forgotten in the delirium of my hor- rible career. I hunted and fished, but instead of bringing the    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6807-00000006"/> spoils to my family, I laid them at the feet of the beautiful forese imaid; She spurned them from her; and, mortified at the rejection  , of my suit from an Indlian, I vowed revenge,-I would carry her .  off' i spite of every thing                      M My wife had a very pretty locket, the gift of her infancy; I un- I dlasped it from her neck one night while she was asleeop, and the next day sought the beautiful Raven-Eye. I found her seated be- neath the shade of a lairge tree, by the side of a brook. She was buIsily engaged in stringingc beads on a, moccasin for a beloved foot. She looked up, displeased, when I approached her. Hlas the R'aven-Eye left her companions for the softer sonrrd- of the brook?"I asked, addressing hier in her own lanoguage. "'The Raven-Eye loves the company of the brook alone," she replied. "Will the light of thire Raven-Eye look upon this gew-gaw?"I said, holdillng the locket towards her. She looked for a few seconds upon it then,. turning her eyes to the brook, she said, "The light of the sun makes it beautiful, but the Raven-Eye would rather look upon the brightness of the water." "The light of the Raven-Eye may look upon both;" and I flung the chaiin around her neck. With a mnien and look that would have becomle a princess, she tore the chain from her neck, dashed it on the groun'd, spit upon it, and rushed through the forest like a (d eer. "Well," said I, as I picked up the trinket, "you shall be mine in spite of yourself, and your tawny lover shall. bite the dust be-, foro another day passes."  I wended my way towards the Indian village, stopping occasion- ally to shoot a squirrel I as I went along. When I reached the vil- lgeo, I observed the Mountain Ea:i'le leaIe my lat, with a flashing or, anfd dignified step, the sure sign of Indian anger. He, seemeed to be coming towards me. When we caine close enough, I spoke' to him, but he merely returned a disdainful look, and passed on without a word. "There is something in the Wind," said I to myself. Hereto- fore we had been as brothers, and I[ wore around my waist at wamn- pitm belt he had given me. I was surpr'ised at this conduct in   ' him, for he was generally so noble and open-hearted, more:so than the generality of Indians,. aBut the mystery was 'cleared, as I thought, when I saw Raven-Eye come out in t'he same manner a few minutes aifter. I supposed she had told him of our interview in the woods, and hence his anger. In the course of that after- noon an invit'tion was sent to me by an old warrior to join a, ge- neral hunt to come off on the next morning. I accepted the invi- tation, as I thought it would be a good opportunity to put my planas into execution, namely, to murder the Mountain Eagle in the heat of the hunt, and return and carry off the Raven-Eye. i   (13) It was a, beautiful morning for a hunt, and we mounted our horses and rode off in high glee, leaving but few men in the village, and those infirm and old,-the better for my purpose, I thought. Our scouts met us with the intelligence that a large herd of buffaloes was grazing on the,plain, and that we should have to take a long round to keep to windward of them. At last we came in sight of as fine a' herd of wild cattle as any farmer would wish to own. We rode cautiously up as near as possible, and then dashed in among, them with the lasso and spear. I was separated from Mountain Eagle by the herd's dividing us. I had enough to do to look to my, own safety; for the buffalo became furious with ratge and pain, and ran with violence at the hoi s men, dismounting some, but happily none were injured. We gathered our scattered band together, and resting a little after the fatigue of the chase, we again rode off to pui:sue our ad- vantaige over the huge animals. 'ihe Mountain Eagle seemed to shun mI, Lut, d"iengiaging myself f'cm a knot of warriors, I ap- proachedl h'm, saying, "Is the Mountain Eagle ' cangry with his brother, the pale face?" "The pale faced brother has a tongue that is forked, and his heart is not like the red man's," was his answer. "What does my brother mean to say?" "He means to say, that Mountain Eagle has a pale-faced bro- ther no longer." "Will ny hv brother tell what the pale face has done, that he can no longer be his brother?" I inquired. "The pale face told me the Raven-Eye, loved him." "The Raven-Eye dos love me, and will be my wife," said I. "The pale face cannot hide the forks in his tongue, and he lies to the Great Spirit," returned he, disdainfully. My spirit was chafed at this insult, but I had no opportunity at present of executing my bloody purpose. We were again in sight of the herd, but night was closing around us, and the hunt was suspended till morning. At different times through the night I oemcavoured to reach the Mountain Eagle, but at all times he seemed to be on the alert, as if he suspected trea- chery from me; and I was therefore compelled to rest still till morning, inwardly resolving not to let another day pass without accomplishing my purpose. Day had scarcely dawned the next morning when the band were stirring, and by daylight we were galloping on to the scene of the hunt. I watched eagerly for an opportunity to, draw Mountain Eagle aside, and despatch him, but I could find none, till we reached the herd, and the lasso was thrown among them. I looked keenly around. Mountain; Eagle was by himself, striving to throw his lasso over the horns of a young cow,--the rest were busily engaged in the chase. I rode up behind him, took aim and fired: he fell from his horse a corpse.    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6807-00000007"/> (14) I turned my horse's head for the village, and galloped away fromr the hunt. I had not ridden far, when I heard the wild war-whoop behind me. I put spurs to my steed; I urged him to his utmost speed, but this time not for the village; for life--the life of a mur- derer-he made the ground fly beneath his feet. They gained on me, inch by inch; they came nearer and nearer; and the cold drops of perspiration stood on my forehead when I looked back and saw how close they were. I, who had often taken the life of my fellow-creature, trembled at the loss of my own! About three miles distant, thlere was a pass in the mountains- if I could only gain that, I nould be safe. I aroused the flagging spirit of my steed with whip and spur, with hope swelling high in my bosom, I still urged him on; I was leaving my pursuers far behind, and I exulted in the hope of escape. 'But in the very mo- mnent of my success, my horse stumbled, and'fell with my foot under him. I was not hLurt, but 1 could not extricate my foot without help, as it was twisted under the saddle, and the jaded and over- ridden brute could Yot miove; and there I lay, tremblingly awaiting my fate. The Indians rode up, and secured me without any trou- ble. I thoughlt I would be toiahawked on the spot, but they de- signed to reserve me for a worse fate-they thought to carry me to the village, and l:urn me alive. For this purpose they despatched a runner to prcpare the tribe for their entrance. Night came on, and they were still a long way from the village, and as their animals were jaded and tired out, they concluded to rest till morning on the plains; I was well secured and laid down by the watch-fire between two stout warriors. They thought it was impossible foil me to escape, and they went to sleep,-contentedly waiting to li' at my 1 ral pile on the morrow. They had bound "v, hLands ,i n ' tl-;ne, of bhe 1 ui hlo hide; but in an hour or two after they had fallen asleep. I found I had worked one of my hands entirely out of the tlg; it was easy to take the other out, but how to get away from between the two Indians was my trouble. At length they fell into a deep sleep,--the watch-fire was nearly out, and in the darkness I slipped cautiously from between them, laid a log which was near in my place, and covered it with my blanket While I 'was doing so an ;i i-n on the opposite side awoke; I pre- tended to mend the fire; he sat up, leoked around him, and seeing me busy with the fire, gave a grunt, and went to sleep .again. I stole-softly away, and hcn about a. hundred yards from the camp, I quickened my pace into a run, and before daylight I was many a mile from them and safe from pursuit. Some of my old companions still hovered around the plains; and knowing where their rendezvous was, I made straight for it.' I found them, and obtained a horse, which donveyed me to the set- tlements in a few days. What had befallen my wife and children, whom I had left behind me, I neither knew nor cared to know. I   ( 15)   had one more deed of vengeance to commit, and then, ho! for Ca- lifornia! I had never forgotten the insult my wife's father had given me, nor my vow of vengeance. So making my way to 'Illinois, I en- tered the pleasant little village, where I first wooed and Won my nowdeserted and cruelly treated wife. It was the Sabbath! The bells tolled for church, as I passed through the village; every thing was still and peaceful, and innocence seemed resting on the village, and I, a ruthless murderer, stood there ready to rend the cloud, and plunge a whole neighbourhuood into mourning. On my way I met the old couple going to church; arm in arm, they walkhald peacefully along. I brushed past them,-my heart burning-with hate and, bloody revenge. The old watch dog barked loudly as I walked up the patrh to the old farm house. I knew every nook and corner of the place. I scanned it well, and fixed my plans. No one wag at home, so I went and returned unknown to any one. About dusk I returned and threw a piece of meat well spi'ead over with arsenic to the dog, and went quietly away. It had the desired effect, for when I returned about midnight the dog was dead. I stole softly up. the steps of the porch and -took down the shutter, having unhinged it through the day, replacing it, so that it passed unnoticed. Having a, diamond with me, I cut a pane of glass, another 'anid another, and entered the little sitting room; from that I went to the drawers, and with a false key unlocked them i and took out all the hard earnings of his life-time. Having secured theli money about me i stole softly up to their bedroom. The door I was open, they slept soundly; all was still, save the loud snore from the hired man in the room above. I looked at them, I could see by the light of the moon which streamed through the curtains hoe, peacefully they slept, fearing no evil. I trembled at the dark deed I was about to commit-a better feeling had come over my blood-thirsty'heart, and I turned away. At the moment I turned to leave the room the old man awoke, and seeing me in his room with a large bowie knife in my hand, he sprang from the bed, and, being a brave man and very strong in his day, he laid hold of me before I had time to escape. The old lady awoke during the scuffle, and her screams rang through the house. The struggle was now for life or death; but I being the strongest laid back the old man's head and. drew the knife across his throat. His wife seeing'his danger seized'hold of my arm, but a few stabs laid her dead by the side of her husband. I escaped from the. house, fled across the fields, changed my clothes, which I had hid in a hollow tree, and passed softly on my way, intending to sail for California by the first ship. But before I left the States for    <pb n="16-17 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6807-00000008"/> (16)    i ever, as I then thought to do, I felt', ^fi:icination to go and see my parents if they were yet alive. ; I took passage for Ohio, and lan(ied e t .licinaati, and in a few days more I entered the house )ous hei;'I 'as horn. But my parents were not there; my brother ini vhis wife filled their places. My brother was not at homei shen T entered, and his wife being a stranger to me, I asked her if old Mr. Aloriison was still alive. She looked at me awhile and thenl replied, "You must be a stranger here, old Mr. Morrison has been dead these ten years."  "And my mother," was about to say,; but I checked myself. "'The old lady,' Mrs. Morrison, i she alive?" "No, sir. She died about a year before her husband. They both died of a broken heart, and lie side by side in the Presby- terian grave yard. I did not ask her who or what was the cause of their dying broken-hearted. I knew too well the reason. I left her, and wended my way to the old grave yard,.and stood over the graves of my parents, a lrui1,nd, guilty man, dyed deep in the blood of my fellow mcini I was too guilty to stand long near that holy spot-I turned and left the place for ever. I returned to Cincinnati and was about to go on board of a steamboat when an officer tapped me on the shoulder and told mt I was his prisoner. Resistance was useless, for half a dozen other officers were standing near, and I was conveyed, a guilty felon, to this state, and placed in the cell of the murderer, where I now lye awaiting the day on which I shall expiate my guilt on the scaffold. I give this confession, to the world; may it be a warning to all who rea't .;'I 1i'ever voluntarily to leave the roof of their parents for the alluring but deceitful pleasures of the world, and the deadly vices which accompany them; as it invariably ends in the ruin of body ar d s6ou and frequently in an ignominious death. CONCLUSION. ,The jury having tried the case of both prisoners separately, retired, bringing in their verdict, guilty, for the husband; but not guilty, for the wife. The guilty man was launched into eternity on the morning appointed for his execution. He repented of his crimes, but like many more of his stamp, when he found he was deprived of the power of committing any farther mischief. But it is to be hoped that he will find mercy from that Being whose laws he has deeply sinned against, and who is a more just and a more terrible judge than his creature man.      <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6807-00000009"/>   PART SECOND. NARRATIVE OF  I was somewhere about the age of eighteen when I became ac- qunaintced with William Morrison. He was then a farmner's man in the neiglbourhood where I lived. Hc had not been there long, and the people knew but little about him; he had a smooth tongue and a handsome .face and as Tfate willed it we fell in love with each other     . '         ^ We kept company for some time, and then- without the consent and even without the knowledge of my parents, we were privately married.- I remained at home against the will of my-husband till he came to ask the forgiveness of my parents, which he did in two days after. Great was the surprise and anger of both of my parents, especially that of my father, when they heard it. Rumrour had been asleep, for nothing was known of it till my husband told it himself, so that they were completely taken by surprise. I was present when my husband called, and the anger of my father was beyond measure. In the heat of his excitement he called him a sneaking rascal, and then turning to me he told me to leave the house and never enter it again. We left the house together, but while on the threshold my husband turned to my father, and giving "mn a look of the most demoniac revenge, told him he would repent his words. He was answered by an oath of defiance, and the door dashed to in his face. We left my home-, and took up our abode in a log cabin belonging to the farmer for whom my husband worked. We, lived here very contentedly for two years or more before I called upon my parents, but the desire to be once more their child overcame every other feeling, and I accordingly madp up my mind one day to visit them. I was received with great kindness by my mother, but my father scarcely noticed me; but the ice was broken, and kindness I knew would follow. I had not been sufficiently acquainted with my husband before marriage to know his temper and disposition, which I found to my    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6807-00000010"/> (20) cost afterwards to be extremely variable. At times he was very kind, at others morose and disagreeable, nay, almost savage. For another year we lived tolerably happy, but after that he became more disagreeable than ever, and more tyrannical. He also neg- lected his business, and frequented the tavern more than was ne- cessary. An inward terror was creeping over me, arid I stood in continual dread of being knocked to the ground when in his moments of ungovernable fury he would taunt me with the words my father used on the day we left him. I bore with him as well as I could, and did my best to make us happy, but it had no effect on the temper of my husband. I did not and would not dare to complain to my parents, for the match was of my own making, and I often Vore a smiling face when my heart was heavy and sad. Things continued this way for some time longer, when one morning he returned from the tavern and with a burst of fury orderied me to go to my father and get him some money, at the same time saying he was not going to toil to keep me or my children any longer.          - My heart beat as if ,it would break at this cruel speech. I en- deavoured to- dissuade him from his purpose, knowing that it was useless to apply to my father for money, but my remonstrance was in vain, only serving to irritate him the more. "Put on your bonnet and go instantly," he said, in a voice of thunder, "and leave that squalling brat with me ;" but I lifted my child in my arms and took the other by the hand, and without another word left the house for my father's. When I entered the house I could not conceal my anguish. My mother asked what was the matter, and through my tears and sobs I told her my errand. "And do you expect money from me to support that vagabond?" asked my father; "not a penny shall he get of mine." "But, father, he will kill me," I replied. "You deserve it for marrying such a rascal," was his answer. My mother tried to' persuade him to give me a few dollars, but all to no purpose, for when once he re- solved upon any thing there was no turning him from it. I left in agony and distress of mind for my home. I thought my father perhaps would relent, when I looked up in his face and implored him for the sake of my children to save inme from his cruelty, but it was all in vain, and I left in sorrow. How I trembled when I oetered the room where he sat awaiting me. "Well," he sid, "did you get it?" "No, he would not give me any." "He wouldn't give a oent to support that sneaking rascal, was not that it?" -I made no answer. "Speak, was that what he said?" "Yes," I faintly answered.   (21) Ho gave a terrible oath, and left the house. In an hour ho returned and told me instantly to prepare to move to a new settle- ment in the west; he would not tell me wlhet and the next morn- ing we were moving slowly westward, I wrote a few lines to my mother,-he would not allow me to go and take leave' of her, and ere the sun 'set' that evening we were far from the h6me of my youth' and the first scene of my troubles. After a week we came to the mouth of the Missouri, where we halted to refresh ourselves and horses. We pitched our tent in the open plain, where there wait plenty of paturo for our animals. While we remained here a r. many pole pple assCed on their route to California by the way of the plains, and my husband seemed to be in continual correspondeince with a number of rfliian- jooking men, who knew every  turn the travellers ma de, and every particle of baggage they carried with them. On the miorning of the third dahy a note was put into his hand' by one of those men, which he read, and then gave orders for our moving farther on, in a very short time we were on our way still farther west. ' In another week we arrived at a beautiful valley in the Rocky. Mountains. It was a paradise for beauty of scenery, and fertility of soil. Here we were joined by a few of the mren I had seen at the mouth of the river. They instantly set about helping my husband' to cut down trees and hew logs Ibr. the building of a cabin. The hut was' soon finished, and several others were built hard by. A few acres of ground were then cleared broke up ready for a garden, and a small corn field, which I planted with corn, and sowed a few seeds in our garden for our winter ise. Summer ad- vanced, and the few provisions We whrou, t witt. us were well nigh exhasted,-they were consumed ;y thet wi'ches who frequented our house morning., noon, and night. I dared not complain of it, they were the chosen companions of my husband. 'Oh how I sighed for the home of my childhood, how I cursed the day I ever looked upon his iface, and listened to h, 'deceilful tongue, and bitterly regretted the word that sealed my doom for ever. i't I eC.,r our. jr vio ,s were entirely' gene aund'for someo time we lived on LLio m sat and corn pulled from the stack. "' t +th Win ter was aporoaching, the long (dreary winter of the Rocky  Mounains,--r-hat should we do for food? Long before spring our corn would be gone, and no means to buy any more with. At last it came, and oh! that I and my poor babes had perished before it came. Travelling to California had stopped as the winter ap- proached, to be resumed again in the spring, asnd not a living soul was to 'be seen save the few who lived near us, and a solitary Indian now and then.  A heavy snow had fallen, and my husband was away from h1ome    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6807-00000011"/> (22) on a hunting expedition, as he told me. When he left we had not a mouthful of any kind of food in the house,-my children cried for bread, and my tears were all they received. A day and a half passed in this manner, and I was reduced to the verge of despair. Cruel as my husband was to me, I was glad rand happy when I heard hs hound bay in the clearing: my children would now have somcthing to eat, lihe would soon be home, and their tears would be dried. iHe entered along with thhree others, bearing something heavy in a sack, which    th   e floor. I though!?t it was buffalo. meat, as the sack was saturated with blood. I ran to open it and cook some for my famished balbes. i raised up the sackl,-the children wwe laughing joyfully at the prospect of a hearty supper. I untied the string, and looked il for the nicest bit to cook. I no sooner looked in the sack than with a scream I sprang from it, and as it fell the ghastly head of a corpse rolled on the floor. "Holloa! what's the matter?" said my husband, turning round to me and looking at the children, huddled together in a corner with fear, "what are you doing with that sack, who told you to open it?" * "I thought it was buffalo meat, the children have had nothing to eat these two days." I replied. "Then they shall have some of the delicate morsel you were about to cook for them," and as lihe said this he opened the sack and cut a piece from the murdered man and laid it on the coals to roast.     -             ' "Will you give that to my children?"I cried. "Hold your tongue for a fool, and be glad you are not left to starve, as you ought to be," was the answer lho made. "You will poison them." ' "ia ha! do you hear that, Hughes?" and He lau!nghed a coaise, brutal laugh, in which the others joined still more disgustingly. In a few' minutes the flesh was .cooked about half through, and he took it off and placed it before the children.' "Don't eat it, don't eat it," I cried, tnd ran to snatch it from them, but a blow from the arm of my husband stretched me on the floor. I lay for a few minutes insensible, and when I raised my head again, the children were devouring the revolting food with the voracity of starving childhood. The men were gone, and they had taken the corpse'withl them. I arose, and taking the remains of the horrible fooAd from the children, I threw it in the fire. "Oh, ma,' we were so hungry," said my little boy. "Why don't you eat some, ma?"' said little Mary, ;"ain't you hungry, too?" "Oh! children, do you know what you have been eating?" "Whyv it was meat father took out of the sack." i     (23.) Yes, but it was cut from the body of the man whose head you saw roll on the floor." Don't' scold us for eating it, ma, we were so hungry." The tears rolled over my cheeks-bitter tears were those; my heart was not hardened then as it isnow, made so by the cruelest of cruelties., I wiped my eyes and looked out: the jingling sound of a pick- axe and shovel came up the valley. I looked, and saw that they were digging a grave, and the sack lay by the side of the hole. I closed the door, and proceeded to wipe up the blood which lay on the floor. While engaged in doing so my husband came in. I looked up at him, and I became as brave as a lion. "Whose blood is this?"I asked. "You are a murderer." "Ask me no more such questions as that, or you may repent it. Whatever passes around here keep your eyes shut and your tongue still;, and your hands busy, if I should want your help." So say- ing, he put on his hunting shirt and went out again. What could I do in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, not knowing whieqy to turn if I dared to fly, and my poor babes, could I. desert them? No, never. There was no succour, no refuge for the degraded, ill-treated wife. I must submit 'to any species of cruelty he might heap on me,-submission was my only resource. In an -hour or two he returned with a deer he had killed, and ordered me to cook some instantly for himself and Hughes, as he called the ruffian who accompanied him; and afterwards to cook sufficient to last several days. I complied, and, though weak from ex- citement and hunger, in a few minutes they sat down to some nicely fried steak of the deer,-bread they had none, but this they were used to. "Hughes," said my husband, "is cvcry thing ready?" "Yes, every thing, and if we have any luck we will meet them to-night at twelve." "Has Jackson got the horse?"      '   ' "Yes, he has him ready, too." "Then the sooner We go the better," said my husband. They packed the meat I had cooked for them in their knapsacks, and soon after left the hut. They were bent on no good: I guessed the purport of their expedition. I gathered from their conversation that a party of California traders were returning to the States, and it was their intention to rob and murder them: it could be no- 'thing else, for no one dwelt in these mountains but the Indians, and no white man's habitation, save lthe few huts scattered around me. Thlat night was spent by me in sorrow, and the bitterest regrets for the past. Nothing but the welfare and the helplessness of my poor babes kept me there. I would have flown and dared the deep    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6807-00000012"/> (24) * snow and rugged path of the wilderness, if I could have done go with safety to my children. The next morning shone bright and beautiful. The sun had just risen when I opened the door and looked over the lovely valley that stretched far into 'the mountains. Although covered with snow it was still beautiful. A few deer were scattered here and there, striving to pick the scanty herbage left uncovered by the snow. I was still looking over the lovely scene, and thinking of the horrible fate to which I was reduced by one imprudent step in nIly whole life, when my attention was attracted by a movement in- the doeer. ' i looked steadily for a few minutes, ahnd could plainly dit'inguish a man on horseback, riding as if for life itself. I thought at first it was one of the associates of my husband, but as he came nearer I saw it was a stranger. I folt frightened: I could not stir from the spot; my eyes were fixed upon the rider as he came nearer and nearer, till he gained the door, and fell exhausted from his hoise at my feet. My courage returned; I ran and brought him a cup of water, he drank it greedily, and gasped out the word, Indians. I fastened his horse, and assisted him into the house. ' "You have been attacked by Indians?"I asked.' "Yes, they looked like Indians, but I believe they were white men in disguise; they attacked us at twelve o'clock last night. The sentry who watched while we slept was murdered at his post, and we were not awakened till they had cut the throats of six of our people, when one of us happened to wake, and immediately gave the alarm. We sprang to our feet, but before we could seize our guns, we wore fired upon, and I believe all fell save myself I rushed from the camp, caught one of the 'horses; and galloped 1 knew not where nor whither, till I arrived hero, and now, I pray you, give me a few days' shelter, till I gain sufficient strength th return to the settlements, as I have lost considerable blood from a a woundi in miy arm.  When he mentioned twelve at night, I knew then that this was the work of may husband. What to do with the man I knew not, if he should return 'before he left: but thinking he had taken a suipply of meat for {at least two days, I told him he might rest in peace till he was able to resume his journey. That'day passed, and I was tremblingly anxious that he would be able to- set- out the next morning fori' St. LoUis. Every rustle, and every little noise I heard caused the blood to flow back to my heart with redoubled forch, for I momentarily expected my husband to come. Day dawned at length, and a welcome morning it was to me. I prepared food for the stranger, and was packing it in his knapsack when the door opened and my husband entered. With difficulty I kept in a cry of despair. The paint had b not been thoroughly washed from his face,-dark straks were here and there.  'V e   (25) Their eyes met,-the stranger started, and put his hand to his side for his knife. It was not there; it had been lost in the fray. I saw the look of wild despair that overspread his countenance: a stifled groan issued from his breast, and his face turned deadly pale. My husband saw he was recognised, and asked him where- he came from, and where he was going. He told him; and was about to leave the cottage, when my husband gave a low whistle and placed his back against the door. The blood left my face; I knew what was coming. The stranger turned his eyes to me,-I pointed to the window,-it was open, he leapt from it and fled across the plain with the speed of a frightened deeor. J  b I looked after him: how intensely I watched that chase;-his pursuers were ttlose behind,-a sharp crack rang through the valley, and the stranger leapt from the ground and fell dead'on his face. They buried him as they did the other, after taking every thing of value from his person. I no* saw that rapine and bloodshed were my husband's occu- i  pations. I thought it was my duty to speak a few words of warn- ing to' him, even at the risk of my life, but when he came in I looked at my babes and was silent.         , Spring advanced, and travellers in large and small companies were rushing on to California; men who left their happy homes, I  their wives and children, brought from the East and the West by the magic cry of gold, gold. One of these was a party of six men. An old man, his wife,   and a beautiful daughter accompanied them. In peace and not suspecting any evil they pursued their way till they came to the lovely valley in which we lived, where fiends of darkness in -  human form had established themselves. When they came near our cabin, my husband went out and requested them to stop and refresh themselves for a day at our house. They accepted his invitation, as he appeared to be nothing more than an humble trapper. Their horses were put away and fed, and every attention paid to them. The richest of the party was the old gentleman, (my husband ; took care to find this out.) He. possessed a wagon of his own, laden with useful and valuable goods. Being extremely talkative and confiding, it was easy to find out what means he possessed, 'and where they were, he himself telling my husband that he carried a great deal of money about his--person. On the morning of their departure my husband said he wished to show the old gentleman a species of quartz which he supposed :  contained gold . IA   "We will be back before' you start," he said to the rest, who stood ready to depart, and objected to his going, as they seemed im-  - patient to proceed on their journey, "and if we shouldn't, why he will soon overtake yoUi-his team is the best among you." a eXI    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6807-00000013"/> (26) The old man listened to the deceitful tongue of my husband? he'went out with him, but never returned. Half an hotur passed, an hour, and they came not. His com- panions began to grumble and grow impatient, when a message was brought by -Hughes, telling them to proceed slowly on their route, and he would join them in half an hour. They were about to go on the receipt of this message, but, urged by the entreaties of his wife and daughter, they stayed half an hour longer. Still they did not. return. They gathered up the reins, spoke to their horscs, and tolling her they would wait for them at a turn of the valley in sight, they moved on without them. As soon as they were a considerable distance off, my husband came in. The old lady turned to look for her husband. . She was met by a blow from the butt end of his rifle.' With one blow her lieacWvas entirely split open, and she fell to the floor a corpse. The young girl flew to the window, but she could not open it,- she screamed murder, and shrieked with all her might;-her screams rang through the valley. There was a' noise at the door, -the .horses had got loose, and it was not his intention to lose them. "Finish her, he cried out to me, "or I will finish you, when I come in." He entered in a moment again, after securing the horses. "You have not done as I bid you," he said; "now take this knife and kill her, or I will kill you.:' The poor girl dropped on her kniees before me. "Spare my life, and I will be your slave for ever," she cried. "Oh, kill me," I cried, "but I cannot take another's life." He said not a word, but stooping down he lifted my child, my darling little Edward, in his arms, and held the horrid knife to his throat. "Now, kill her, or I will cut this child's throat before your eyes." he was not trifling. .I was ma . With the scream of an idiot I seized the knife and plunged it into the heart of the poor ill- fated girl, and dropped insensible beside the body. Thus was I compelled to be a murderer in defence of the life of my child. When I came to, I felt myself rouighly shaken by the shoulder, and some cold water was dashed in my face. "Come, get up," said my husband, roughly, "they have heard the girl's screams, and are coming as fast as they can-we have no time to lose." I looked around for my children-they were safe, and with my hands still wet with blood, I helped him to saddle the horses; the goods and wagon had been hid by the others. We mounted, and giving the rein to our steeds were soon hid ii a pass in the mountains.    (27)  The party on coming. up and finding the lifeless bodies of their friends, set fire to the cabin and burnt it to the ground. They made search for us, but failing to find us, they set off with all speed to the next station, where they gave the alarm, and a party was despatched to find the murderers if possible.' My husband knowing this, kept concealed among the mountains till' the' heat of the pursuit'was over, not venturing ut by day, anid creeping stealthily out at night to trap a deer. So close did they come sometimes, that .1 thought it impos- sible they could pass by, and not fi'd us. When the excitement died, away we retirned again to the valley, wh!ere he commenced his depredations anew. In one of his attacks on a party of returned Califormnians, he was so severely w&amp;outnded thlat his life' hung by a thread. It was only by the exertions of Hughes that he escaped at all. They brought him bleeding and senseless to the cottage, hut not a tear dimm'ed my eyes when I saw it, for my heart was hardened to him ever since the murder of that poor girl. For week'l;hle lay hovering between life and death. I attended him as well as my scanty means would allow, although 'e cared little if he never rose awain fromr the bed on which he lay; indeed I would have rejoiced at his death. At one time, thinking that his end was ap- proaching, he called me to his bedside. "Mary," said he, "I[ have been a very wicked man, cruel to you and to our children; if I am spared, I will be a different man ; but what will atone for the blood of the innocent persons I have killed?" Alas! for the deceit of the human heart. He got better, regained his strength, and 'plunged deeper than ever into the paths of sin and iniquity.                     " ,  it was no longer safe for us to remain in the valley, and we re- moved to another station further in the mountains. Not far from here was an Indian tribe. They very often made excursions a'ainst the whites, especially when coming from California. With these marauders of the forest li he leagued himself. The better to screen his depredlations, he built a wigwam among them, and becamne as a part of the tribe. I would have been happy, if I could, have forgotten the past, among these simple children of nature, but my troubles wir'er not yet over. My husband hunted with' them, fought with thetr, and became a very Indian in every respect, only without their nobleness of mind. Among the tribe there was a beautiful girl; her dark eyes, and tawny Indian skin, added 'to her elastic and graceful form, made her the envy .and the admiration of all the young warriors of the tribe. The Raven Eye, as they called her, was a most bewitching creature. Her laugh was the echo of a guiltless heart, and her step, if touched with a little Indian coquetry, was still free from that affected limp of our fair-skinned city belles. We became intimate friends, and I loved the tawny Indian maid as a sister. Although I knew hut little of their language, I learned rapidly fiotn my kind instructress; and she was at alltimes welcome to my hut. There was a young warrior in the tribe who loved her with the i    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6807-00000014"/> ( 28 ) most devoted affection; he was for ever restless and uneasy except when by her side; his look followed her. every movement, and on the first breath of the morning he would present her with a bunch of wild flowers gathered in the forest.,. They were happy, she the Raven Eye, and he the brave Mountain Eagle. My husband secretly admired this girl, and it was whispered through the tribe that the pale-faced warrior backed in the smiles of the Raven Eye. He had smoked the pipe of peace and taken the wampum belt from Mountain .Eagle, and was confirmed his brother. But his attentions to the dark--eyed beauty soon began to tell on the temp-)er of this war- ror, and my poor hut bec :,me soon after the scene of a lover s quarrel. They met one day in my hut, whlen 'rmy husband was out, and the warrior looked coldly' on his betrothed ; but her smi!es were as sweet and her words as kind as ever. "Does the Raven Eye," he began, "speak to the Mountain Eagle with the tongue of the Pale Face?'" The blood flushed the temples of the Indian girl, making her dark skin still darker, while, her eyes flashed with the spirit of her tribe. She raised herself to her full height, and, looking him fill in the face, she replied,  "Has the Mountain Eagle listened so often to the tongue of the Pale Face, that he cannot judge between the speech of the Raven , Iye and his pale-faced brother?"' The Mountain Eagle turned without another word and left the hut,. mortified ancf crest-fallen. Then turning to me, she continued, "Does rny pale-faced sister think I love her husband?" "No," I replied, "but does not the pale-faced brother love you?". "He does, but his tongue is forked, and the Raven Evye knows it, and she spits on his love." "Noble girl," I exclaimed; and kissed her cheek. "Here is a lesson from the children of nature!" A grand hunt was about to come off, and the warriors were making great preparations for it. Invitations were sent around to all' the principal braves, and among the rest my husband received one. The day arrived., and the Indian village was left entirely deserted by all the warriors of the tribe, and none but women and children and infirm men remained. If prosperous, they would return in a day or two, if not, in .a week. It was about noon of the second day that myself and Raven Eye sat together in cur lodge. All at once Raven Eye, who had been gazing on the west for the space of a few minutes with, her larcge d(ark eyes, as bright 'and as clear as the bird she was named after, turned to me, and spoke as follows,: "Does the 'pale flower see, under yon cloud, a runner who comes to the village with tidings?" I looked, and although possessed of keen and piercing eyes; yet I ould not see the movement of a human being. "See you not yon horseman riding alone'?" she continued. s *                          ;   (29) "No," I replied, "I see nothing but the tall pines on the sides of the -mountains." An old chief who was standing near lifted his almost sightless eye- balls and exclaimed, "The sight of the pale face is as that of the mole! Daughter of the dark eye, think of this, when thou askest the pale face to open his eyes to the sun: but yonder rider cometh with evil tidings, his steed is covered with foam, and his heart bends under the weight it carries."               .- The rider approached, and I could now discover the tall form of an Indian urging to its utmost speed the animal he bestrode. He reached the village; and flinging himself from the horse, walked deliberately up to he old Indian.. They entered the old man's lodge, and we were prevented from hearing the tidings he bore. But in a few minutes after, the death song was chanted from the lodge; it was caught by others, and the strain was raised all over the village before they knew for whom they' sang. the death song. The' Raven Eye, who was still standing beside me, turned pale at the sound. The old Indian was the father of the Mountain Eagle.              ;: It was not the custom of the Indians to intrude upon any one in their lodge. She therefore stood-mute and terror-stricken by my side. But we' were not left long in ignorance. The runner came, out of the lodge and walking up to the Raven Eye spoke to her in a very low voice. During the time they were speaking, his eye was often directed to me. When he had done I requested to know the cause of so much soropw in the tribe. "Broken lily of the pale face," said she, "your husband has brought down the Mountain Eagle'from his eyrie, and he now lies dead on the plains." "Has my husband slain the Mountain Eagle?"I asked, hurriedly. "He has made desolate the Lodge of the Bending Willow, he has dimmed the glad light of the Raven Eyel'-was the answer I received. I passed into my lodge; I could witness her silent anguish no longer. Another heart made desolate, another murder committed by this fiend of darkness! Oh would 'that they may have given you the reward of your crimes, that the full weight of Indian vengeance may have fallen on your accursed head, were the words I mentally uttered, as I sat down with a sad heart in the midst of'my children. I had not heard, I had not' asked, if he had escaped, but the-next day the tribe returned, bearing the dead body of the Mountain Eagle along with them, but my husband had escaped, and for a worse end. I was fearful lest their vengeance should fall upon me and my poor children, and I sat trembling in the lodge all day, thinking every step came to summon us to our deaths.      About one in the night, the curtain of my lodge was drawn back, and the light step of the Raven Eye startled me from the light slumber in which I had fallen. She put her finger to her lips when she entered, to caution me against speaking above a whisper.    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6807-00000015"/> (30) "You are in danger," she said, 'the tribe will put you and. your children to death; the blood of the Mountain Eagle calls for vengeance on the pale face." "Does my sister, the Raven Eye, come to prepare me for death?" "No) the Broken Lily hath not broken her faith with the Raven Eye." "I am ready to die," I faltered, "but my poor children, if they. Could only be spared." "The Raven Eye does no't come as an enemy, she has eaten salt with her pale sister, and she wishes to save her life." "How! Oh tell me how, for the sake of my poor babes?' She proceeded to tell me as well as I was able to undlerstand, that if I left the v1illage in an hour, and coultl reach the station of the whites by day break, I sho'uld find a company returningr to the states. The fort was not more than five miles listant, but even that short distanee I coul( not reach by day break, on account of my children. But this difficulty was soon put aside by the Raven Eye, who left the lodge for a momnent and returned with a couple of hQorses, ready saddled. She sprang upon one, and taking the eldest of the children, I mounted the other, and we set off for the station i We reached it before day, and wlen within half a mile she drew up and alighted. I did the same, and the Raven Eye and the Broken Lily parted for ever. We took a kind farewell of each other: she returned to the village and I toolk my \vay to the fort. At daylight the company came up, and we w'ere snugy fixed in a wagon and conveyted in safety to the states., I made my way to the state of Illinois, to my home, filled with the hope of e'nbracing my dear mother before she left this world for another. As I drew near the farm house my heart fainted within me. Was she alive? I knew not, 1 had heard nothing from her since I left th(em-I had not the courage to proceed. I stopped at a small lhoiuse where lived my schoolmate and friend, Jane Wilson. When I entered, my early friend, now a blooming and happy wife, did npt know me, but she arose to meet the wayfaring stranger with hospitality. "You do not know me, Jane," JIfaltered.1 She started, and looked in my face, and then on the faces of my two children. "Gracious! it is not Mary Carrick," she said. "No, Jane, it is not Mary Carrick now," I said, sorrowfully, "but it once was."  "Oh, Mary, what you must have suffered, and still more what I have to tell you, or do you know it all already?" "Know what, Jane, are my parents well, are they alive?' She shook her head,--I saw what that meant; I burst into tears. "Hlow did they die?"I asked, when more composed. "Oh, I cannotk tell you," she said. "Tell me, I can bear any thing; you know not what I have gone through since I saw you last." "They were murdered."  t Had she struck me with a knife to the heart, I would not have felt   ( 31 ) as faint and sick as I did at that moment. She brought me a glass of water; I drank, and was revived by it. I asked her who had done the deed. She told me the person was never found who did it, but enough had been known to convince them that it was my husband. They had been murdered' but a short time before my arrival. My course was decided upon.' I left my two children in the care of Jane Wilson, and gave myself a prisoner into the hands of tha nearest magistrate, with directions where to find my husband, for during my stay in the mountains I had learned where their different rendezvous were. The result has been seen. They captured him and his com- panion in guilt, the ruffian Hughes. And now, having given this narrative to the world, in confirmation of the confession of my husband, I freely and from the bottom of my heart, forgive his horrible cruelty towards me, and may his offended Maker have mercy on his soul, and pardon the sin which he caused me to commit in the death of an innocent woman.
