I will turn it over with this shell, and then thee can sit and look at it." "Isn't it a queer thing, Jacob? It looks like Aunt Susan's apple -jelly. Do you believe it is a living thing, and feels when we touch it?" "It made my fingers smart, Ruth, when I tried to take it up, so that I will not handle it any more. If it gives so much pain, perhaps it can feel it also." "Oh; but, Jacob, a nettle stings, and fire. burns, and cold freezes. This is nothing but  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7484-00000005"/> 6        My Hero. jelly. I do not believe it can hurt us, and you need not be so afraid of hurting it; turn it over quick, Jacob." The boy was handling the curious creature with great tenderness. "I do n't think it likes to be disturbed, Ruth; it looks to me like an animal that has lost its shell; 'poor, harmless wanderer,' as the story- books say." The boy turned it over, but it still looked like a mass of jelly about as large as a quart bowl. "It is a real, live animal, I know, Ruth; be- cause I. read about such in my Natural History. But there is Richard Armstrong sitting on the sand yonder; he can tell us, for he is learned in such matters." So, holding the odd thing carefully with two shells, he started to carry it to a man who sat watching the incoming tide, apparently oblivioos -to anything else around him. He leaned against one of those rocks that are washed by the high   An Adventure. tides, - moss - covered and honey - combed by the action of water, while remnants of sea - weed still clung to its sides. He was, perhaps, fifty years of age, a little above the medium hight, with a broad chest and a strongly - marked, well - proportioned head, still well covered with hair which was sprinkled with gray. The features were Targe and regular, the forehead high and broad, and the eyes, which were of dark blue, were set deep into the head. He was a reserved, thoughtful man, and yet the shyest child, after one earnest look at his face, would not shrink from him. He had a peculiar manner when talking to children, which made them forget the difference in age. He was child- like himself, never repelling them when they asked questions, and never laughing at their igno- rance. "Jacob," said Ruth, "I can not understand why your mother is so grave when Mr. Arm- strong's name is mentioned;  only yesterday   &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7484-00000006"/> 8        My Hero. Auntie said, with tears in her eyes and a hand on his shoulder,- Richard Armstrong, thee must come to the light ;' and he replied,--'Martha, I seek truth;' and then Auntie looked more sad if possible, and I heard her say, - Thou art wise above what is written.' What does it mean, Jacob?" "Hush, Ruth, he will hear us. I will ask mother some day, and then thou shalt know." Jacob Stirling, was at this time about twelve years of age. The only thing about him which might interest a stranger was a pair of large, brown eyes, very sweet and tender in expression. He wore a drab- colored suit, cut after the fashion of the Quakers, the jacket a miniature copy of his father's lapeled and rounded coat. His broad - brimmed hat was tied with a drab rib- bon, and he had that air of repose and cleanliness almost inseparable from his sect. His feet were bare, and the trowsors rolled up that he might wade in the water.   An Adventure.       9 His companion was two years younger,- a fair, blue - eyed girl, evidently not of the sect of the Quakers, for she wore a white frock, a broad, blue sash, and a dainty little hat, also trimmed with blue, while around her neck was a gold chain bearing a tiny locket. She, too, had taken off her shoes and stockings, and when the waves came and washed her little white feet, they looked in the water like two pearly shells. Richard Armstrong spoke kindly to the chil- dren, when Jacob laid his burden at his feet and said,- "Will thee tell us about it?" t Is it alive, and will it feel if I poke it with this stick?" asked Ruth, not waiting for an answer to the first question. "Yes, Ruth, I think it feels; but I doubt whether it is endowed with any other sense. This is a Medusa, or Sea Nettle, Jacob, one of the lowest of all organized animals. Come close to me and I will show you its mouth, here in th4 f  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7484-00000007"/> 10        My Hero. center of its body. When the mouth is open, the creature looks somewhat like a flower, for it has a number of fleshy horns or protuberances about it. Through these he squirts water. There is no other organ but the mouth." "What do Sea Nettles eat, Richard?" asked Jacob. "Any little shell - fish they can find. This dne, I fancy, has been eating muscles. By and by it will turn itself inside out, and then you can see the little shells which it has not digested." "Turn itself inside out! That is funny," said Ruth. "Where are its eyes, Mr. Armstrong?" "It has neither eyes nor ears, I think. It feels, and can defend itself by discharging a liquid, which is said by some to be poisonous." "Can it move, Mr. Armstrong?" "Certainly; but it is slower than a snail. The little muscles on its body are hollow and filled with liquid. Look at them   they are like prickles. By means of these it moves, but not   An Adventure.       " as fast as you moved, Miss Ruth, when you ran a race with Jacob on the sand this afternoon." "And beat him, did n't I, Mr. Richard?" said the child, her eyes sparkling as she spoke. "Yes, by five steps at least; but look! see what I have in my basket!" and he held up a fish, beautifully mottled or varied with silver and black and orange hues. "That is beautiful!" exclaimed Ruth; " what is it, Mr. Armstrong?" "It is a rock cod. I caught it on the rocks a few hours ago; and here is a star- fish,- anoth- er of those curious things that show us how life has progressed on this globe, or rather carrying us back to those ages when life began,- the first faint struggle of-animal existence. See this star- fish with its five fingers--" As he spoke a party came trooping to the shore, gayly dressed and full of life and sport. Four or five were in bathing costumes of graJ and scarlet. These preceded the others and en  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7484-00000008"/> 12        My Hero. tered the water, meeting the first breaker with a shout and a merry laugh. There was one with a step like a fawn and with golden hair that floated over her shoulders, who was as fearless as a mermaid and seemed as familiar with the sea. It was a beautiful picture, as she paused an instant for the incoming wave, standing firm as the surge rolled in, flinging its foam over her. The creamy, curdling mass hid her from sight for an instant, and then she emerged, her golden hair giving gold for gold in the sunlight, and her merry laugh ringing upon the air as the wave died tupon the shore. The "quick, redoubling dash" of the wave was greeted with shouts from the party on the beach, and all eyes were turned to the next breaker which had already reared its head and nodded a challenge to the bathers. The next instant the great wave tossed its hoary mane and the fair bather was hidden in the white crest; an instant more, and the sparkling spray fell from the dark i        +   An Adventure.      13 mass, and, breaking, ran and melted in soft white curves upon the smooth beach.  Then came a pause;- one, two, three heads emerged from the water, but the golden -haired girl was not among them ;- an instant of expectation, not of fear, for she was known to be a swimmer, and it was supposed that she was merely playing hide and seek with old ocean. Another pause, and then a sudden horror seized the whole party. The three bathers looked around them in terror, and one plunged beneath the wave in frantic haste, but only to rise again with a cry for help that rang along the beach and was echoed by the headlands in the distance. The whole party were now powerless and dumb, and the three bathers came ashore pale and terror- stricken. Robert Armstrong laid the star - fish back in his basket and turned to look at the party. They were all young, mere boys and girls. He gave one glance in the direction from whence the bathers came, then threw off the large  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7484-00000009"/> "       My Hero. linen blouse which he wore, divested himself of stockings and shoes, and plunged into the water. There was no reckless haste in his manner. He was compose4and calm. The hush on shore was painful, but the waves rolled in, high and still higher, and the breakers tossed their foam in wild delight upon the shore. What knew they of hu- man life or human sorrow? It seemed hours, but scarcely a moment had passed, when Richard Armstrong was seen to rise from the water with a burden in his hand. Tile young girl had fallen upon a rock, and wounded her head against its rough sides; the long hair had become entangled also; but by this she had been saved. He bore her without effort, and seemed, with his massive head and brawny arms, to defy the waves. He laid her on the beach, ,but no signs of life were to be seen. The cheers which rent the air when he first raised her from the water were changed to groans and tears. "Be quiet," he said, sternly, " and do as I bid   An Adventure.      15 you. It is no time for useless noise, and the life is still in her." They obeyed him, and before many minutes passed she was sufficiently restored to be carried to a house, whither the party followed, and there was silence again, save the music of the sea. The two children had been mute but interested spectators. "Now, Miss Ruth," said Mr. Armstrong, "we will walk a few minutes on the warm sand, and then I will show you the remaining treasures in my basket." The little girl's only reply was to spring up, put her arms round his neck and kiss him, all re- gardless of his dripping garments and of her own neat attire. "What a brave man you are, Mr.' Richard, to save that beautiful girl I I love you;" and she twined her beautiful arms around his neck and kissed again and again the large brown face. He put her down tenderly, saying, "You will  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7484-00000010"/> 16     .My Hero. soil your pretty dress, little one;" and then added in a low voice, - I may not have done a good thing, after all. Life is a doubtful bless- ing." Jacob was no less interested in the scene, but he manifested it in a more boyish way. His great, brown eyes were fixed upon Richard with a look of admiration, as he said,- "Will thee teach me to swim, that I may save drowning people?" "I will teach you to swim that you may save yourself first. Now we will look at my basket and examine its treasures. I see Ruth is already busy with its contents." She was admiring the rich hues of the rock- fish. "Here is the star- fish, or five fingers; you see there are several branches united together like the spokes of a wheel; the mouth is in the common center. This is another specimen of the animals in the lowest scale of creation,- of that scarcely articulate life from which man has at last risen, the crown of all."   An Adventure.      17 Mr. Armstrong then told them of the deep sea deposits which have been brought to the surface, and found, on examination by powerful micro- scopes, to be the remains of an animal like that before them,-"a living jelly, without mouth, nerves, muscles, or distinct organs, and only manifesting its vitality by thrusting out and throwing back little filaments which serve for arms and legs; and yet these animals lay the foundationof immense chalk cliffs hundreds of feet high, with vast pinnacles and needles, stand- ing out in the sea, sharp and solitary. "Just think of the work done by these little creatures." The conversation continued till Jacob said,-- "Come, Ruth, we must go home.   Mother will expect us at six o'clock." "Shall I row you in my boat?" asked Mr. Armstrong. "It will save you a long walk, for I can land you at the bridge." The children were delighted with the proposal. Jacob spread a large shawl on which Ruth was to sit with her  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7484-00000011"/> 18        My Hero. basket of shells by her side. She clung to these as rare treasures. Just as they were stepping into the boat, a young lady came running down the beach. Save for her hair, neither of the children would have -recognized her as the same person who, two hours before, had been so near death. She was dressed in a gown of some soft, blue material that seemed to float as she moved; her sunny hair was wound around her head, and, though still moist from her long bath, hadnot lost its wavy outlines. She had a sweet, fair face, and now her eyes glistened, and a soft color suffused her cheeks, as she came up to Mr. Armstrong, extending her little, white hands. "Are you going away, sir? I want to thank you with all my heart; and yet I can not find wor to express my gratitude." She could say no more, but burst into tears. Mr. Armstrong was somewhat embarrassed himself, but his stern features softened as he said,-   An Adventure.       19 "Do not feel the obligation so deeply; it was no notle deed on my part, for it involved no sac- rifice. I am almost as much at home in the water as a fish. A Newfoundland dog might have done the same for you, had one been here. And the wound in your head?" he asked. It will be better soon," she said, as she threw back a mass of her shining hair and showed a somewhat ugly dent encrusted with the blood which had oozed from it, and which Mr. Artn- strong had advised her not to wash away. "That will give you no further trouble," he said. The next time you bathe, be a little more wary of the rocks ;" and he turned to push his boat from the shore, but she sprang forward and laid her hand on his arm. "Do not go away till I have learned your name." "That is of no consequence," he said. "I am an o man with few kindred or friends," and again he turned to his boat. The little hand still detained him and grasped the coat sleeve tighter.  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7484-00000012"/> 20       My Hero. "But now there will always be some one to think of and care for you. I shall think of you every morning when I wake, for that is the time when I think of my father. I shall join your name with his in my prayers. He has gone to India, and is now on the ocean." There was a singular expression on Richard Armstrong's features as he looked into the face of the lady whose hand still rested on his arm, --a look of pity with a shade of scorn,-a look with which Jacob was familiar, though it always puz- zled him. But the beautiful face that looked up to Richard Armstrong saw only the large, regular features and the calm, blue eyes, and thought of the firm, strong grasp of the hand that had res- cued her, and recalled his respectful manner when consciousness first returned to her, There was something about the man which won from her more than gratitude. She admired him, for his calm strength and the quiet way in which he w6uld have released her from all obligation.   An Adventure.       21 "I must have your name," she said, if it is only John Smith or Jim Brown. I shall like it for your sake." It is n't-Jim Brown at all," said Ruth, hast- ily. "It is Mr. Richard Armstrong, and I think it is a very nice name." "Indeed it is,-Armstrong; rightly named. It was a strong arm that saved me. Mr. Richard Armstrong of"-- "Oakwood," said Ruth. "It is a beautiful place, too, where he lives- only -only -" and she hesitated. "Only what?"  said Richard Armstrong kindly. "Only a little gloomy, because there are so many trees, I suppose." The man turned, and something like a sigh es- caped him; but he made no reply. During all this time Jacob had stood in hi bare feet, holding his shoes and stockings witl one hand just ready to spring into the boat, tha  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7484-00000013"/> 22        My Hero. he might the more easily aid Ruth to take her seat; but his eyes, meanwhile, were fixed upon the young lady's face in boyish admiration. "Will thee tell us thy name?" he said. She smiled, perhaps because the elder man had so little curiosity, and, turning to the boy, she re- plied,- "My name is very simple and easy to speak;- Mary Mudie." "I like it," said Jcob. "And now, shall we introduce all around?" said the young lady. "This is your sister, I suppose." "No, she is not my sister. I call her cousin. She lives at our house, and is just like a sister to me, for her father and mine are very dear friends. Her name is Ruth Johns, and her father lives in London." "And his name is Jacob Stirling," said Ruth, and his father's name is like his, and his grand- father's too, I believe."   An Adventure.       23 "Yes, Ruth, and the name of all my fathers, away back to the old times when we read about the Quakers in English history." "I like the name. It is a good Bible name," said the young lady. "My home is Norwood, near the sea, on the coast of Maine." ; Yes, yes. I know about the place. Father and Richard Armstrong go down there sometimes in summer in a little yacht which they own, does thee not, Richard?" "Yes," he replied, and turning to the lady he asked,-"Are you the daughter of Captain Jerry Mudie, Master of the Brig Undine?" "I am his youngest daughter,-his baby, as he calls me, Mr. Armstrong; and if he were here, he would thank you as I can not." "Come, children, the tide serves, and we must go, or we shall be left like yonder sea- weed on the beach." The lady stood and watched the little boat as it rode the waves, guided by the deep, long, steady  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7484-00000014"/> 24        My Hero. strokes of the oarsman. The whole movement suggested both poetry and power. "He is a strange man," she said to herself; "and yet I like him. He almost repelled me, and may not think of me again; but I shall never forget that strong, sad face." The boat rounded the headland and was lost to sight while she stood on the beach, but soon the shouts of her friends roused her from her reverie. The rebound from the terror which the accident had inspired gave greater gayety to the party, and though there was no more bathing that day, there was dancing and a feast. Meanwhile the party in the boat went swiftly over the water, and were soon landed at the bridge. Richard Arm- strong bade them good evening, and they walked onward in the direction of their home. They soon turned into a long, shady lane, much of it running through the Stirling farm. As they walked, chatting about Richard Armstrong and the pleasure which he had given them, they were 9   An Adventure.       25 interrupted by a voice which at once caught their ears and stayed their steps. "Halloo, there; can't you stop for a fellow a minute?" "That is Dick Barnard," said Ruth. "I am sorry he wants to go with us. I do not like him, Jacob." "Thee must be neighborly, Mother says. Ii will not-do to run away from him." "Then I will go by the side of the hedge; and youtcan walk between me and Dick," said Ruth; and she changed places at once with Jacob. Dick was about the age of Jacob; but evidently did not belong to the sect of the Quakers, for hif dress was of gay hues, and ragged and dirty withal. He carried a basket full of fish, about af heavy a load as he could well manage. "Do you see my mackerel? I bought them of a fisherman for five cents apiece, and I shall sell them up at the, village for ten; so you see I wil double my ,money." , He  .     ,  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7484-00000015"/> 26        My Hero. "And what will thee do with thy money?" asked Jacob. "Put it in my strong box, under lock and key, and when I get thirty dollars I mean to buy some goods and turn peddler." "And leave the school?" said Jacob. "I shall go to school next winter to finish my Arithmetic. I am in Compound Interest now; but by jabers, Jacob, I can beat you there." "No boy in school can beat Jacob," said Ruth, indignantly. "You know he got the highest marks examination day, and did n't Master Lancy say that he stood at the head of all his classes?" "Not in  Arithmetic, Ruth," said Jacob. "Dick is right there, I am not quick at figures." "It comes natural to me. You see, I am al- lus lending money to father.

Poor Jacob thought very hard for a moment, and then said, faintly,-"I think it will be about sixty cents." "You 'll never do to let money if you can't hit nearer than that," said Dick. "It is just sixty - one cents, ten mills and five-tenths of a mill. Now if you lost one cent, ten mills and five-tenth of a mill on seventeen dollars and a half, how much would you lose on a thousand dollars?" "Oh dear, Dick," said Jacob.

"No; that belongs to Richard Armstrong. You see that path yonder, running by the side of the pond. That leads to Oakwood." "I can see their little white heads," said Ruth. I do love pond lilies. Jacob, will you ask Mr. Armstrong to give us some?" "Yes, Ruth, I will ask him when I drive the cows to pasture to - morrow morning." "I sha'n't stop for that," said Dick as he climbed the high. locked gate. "I'll jump into that little skiff and get lots. You ee the first ones bring most money." At this he plunged through the meadow and into the soft, boggy earth, and was unchaining the skiff, when a luge bull - dog rushed out of the bushes and made towards him. In his fright he ran, and not heeding the direction, was soon knee deep in the mud on the edge of the pond, the dog holding him tightly with his teeth fixed in the   An Adventure.       29 boy's woolen jacket.

"If you will stay here, I will run across the field to Auntie Dole's, and perhaps I can get some help there." But before she had gone many steps, Pat Con- ner, one of the servants at Oakwood, had hear( the noise and came down to the pond.

"There, you can't say I have n't got pluck. I reached out and got it for you, the instant Pat called the dog off." "It is a beauty, Dick, and how sweet it smells I I like pond lilies next to roses." "What will your mother say to see you in that plight, Dick?" said Jacob. "My mother say? Nothin' of course; she's used to it. 'Just like our Dick!' that's all she 'll say. Ye see we're not nice at our house like your folks. If I only make some money, that is all father cares for, and mother don't keep no girl, you know, and works hard from morning till night. She hain't no time to mind what I do." The children parted.  "How droll he looks!" said Ruth, "with his torn hat and his clothes covered with black mud. , When he was talking about his money, I thought of apoor little water- cress girl that father and I met in London one day.

I knows, too, how many fardens goes to a tuppence,-eight. That's as much as I wants to know.' She was just my age, Jacob, then,- eight years old. She was a poor little water- cress girl, and had nothing to eat only when she earned some pennies by selling water-cresses. Papa, let me give her a shilling, and I can almost see how her eyes sparkled when she took it. I remember, too, that I said to him, as I walked along,- What a sad thing, Papa, that she can't read Fairy Tales, and Blue Beard, and Cinder- rella, and Forty Thieves, and Jack the Giant Killer!' Is Dick Barnard poor, that he must work so hard and dress so shabbily?" "No indeed, Ruth.

The children's home was now in sighlt, a large, plain house, painted a drab color, with trimmings and blinds a shade darker than the body of the house. There was a large porch in front, and the neatly kept yard was surrounded by a paling, painted the same color as the house. The barn was large, painted like the house, and as the ample doors stood open, the great barn lofts could be seen -ull of new hay. Broad fields stretched away down almost to the river side, the corn was ripen- ing in the August sun, and the grass was giving promise of a second crop. Everything indicated thrift and neatness. Grandma Stirling was sit- ting in the porch, knitting a very long stocking. Her plain cap and drab dress were spotless, and her face was as placidas theevening sky. Grand- father Stirling had laid aside. his paper, and was saying to his' wife,--' Lucy, will thee come to tea?" when the children came into the yard.   An Adventure.       33 "O Grandpa! I am glad supper is ready, for I am so hungry!" said Ruth. "But we have had a splendid time!" and she sprang into his arms as he opened them, and gave him two or three kisses. Only think, Grandpa; Mr. Armstrong saved a young lady's life this afternoon. Is n't he a grand old fellow? The lady was beautiful, as beautiful as- as Cinderella; and the best of it all 'is, he did n't seem to think he had done anything brave at all; and then he told us all about a liv- ing jelly that eats and stings and turns itself in- side out." "Ha! ha! ha! laughed Jacob; and it was a clear, sweet voice that rang out so merrily. You are always in such haste when you talk, Ruthy, that you mix things up into a hasty - pud- ding,-a living jelly; ha I ha!" "And what else could it be, Cousin Jacob?- Tell us if you can remember the long, hard words Mr. Richard used." "Grandpa do n't know any better now, little  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7484-00000019"/> 34         [ fy Hero. one," said the old gentleman. "I guess thee used the right words for me. Thee means the jelly fish." "Yes, Grandpa; isn't it one of the curious things which the sea produces?  "Yes, the ocean is full of wonders, and for that matter, so is the earth and the sky." "Ruth, my dear," said a comely woman of per- haps thirty - five years, who had just entered the room, "tea is ready, and thy dress is not clean, nor thy hair smooth." Ruth sprang to the floor. "Pray excuse me, Auntie, I will look nice in two minutes;" and she ran into the house. ' Do not be in too much haste, my child; stake time to wash thyself and change thy dress. Hur- ry is not seemly in a lady." Jacob had already disappeared. There was no necessity to reprove him for carelessness, for cleanliness was hereditary in this family, and de- scended, like the promised blessing in the second   An Adventure.       35 commandment, to the third and fourth generation. In the mean time the father had come in from the field, with brown face and rugged hands, bIut with a calm, smooth forehead, and a clean linen coat, glossy and smooth. The whole household was in harmony with the calm, sweet evening of that August day. Richard Armstrong, after landing the children, sailed a half mile further north and then turned his boat into a little cove, full of water at high tide, offering a pleasant little harbor, -under a large willow tree whose pliant boughs kissed the water as it met the banks. Securing his boat, he followed a well -worn footpath which led to the rear of his own place.  Oakwood comprised about thirty acres of land, including orchard, lawn and garden. The land originally bore many oaks, and Richard Armstrong's grandfather, who purchased it from the Indians, had the good taste to leave many of them standing. To this day their sturdy trunks and great domes of glossy foliage  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7484-00000020"/> 36        My Hero. add much to the beauty of the grounds. There were a number of them by the side of the brook whose untroubled waters danced in careless glee over the pebbles, to meet the broad, silent river, and the sunlight that ran in and out, and over and over, through the quivering foliage, played bo - peep also with the rivulet, making it laugh and sparkle. But the elms were Richard Armstrong's pride. There were many of them,-grand old trees, strong and lusty, though more than a cen- tury old. They flung their long boughs and graceful foliage over the avenue leading from the road to the main entrance of the house,-a wind- ing road, cool and dark even at mid - day in summer. The house, built by the first purchaser of the land, was a frame building, with a massive stone foundation five feet in depth,' the timbers above were very heavy, and the massive beams generally were visible in the interior of the rooms. There were deep embrasures inthe windows, with low, broad seats, and there were curious old   An Adventure.       37 corner cupboards, and some rare carved work over the mantels, and there were large, deep cellars with many apartments, and a garret ample and broad enough for all the relics of many gen- erations past and to come. The main building and all the offices were painted a dark stone color, and the fences, save a well-kept hedge of some hundred rods in extent in front of the house, were of iron and stone mason - work,-not the little border fences so common in the region. Ruth was right when she said, "it looks a little gloomy," not merely on account of the trees;- indeed she felt that there was something else about Oakwood, but she had no words to express it. There was an intense quiet and loneliness about the place. Not a sound, save the gurgling of the brook over the pebbles, was heard this summer evening as Richard Armstrong followed the foot- path, and even that sound was lost as he came nearer the house. The garden was in perfect order. There was a  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7484-00000021"/> 38        My Hero. profusion of flowers. Large quantities of white lilies were in bloom at this time, and they gleam- ed in the dark foliage like stars in the deep blue of heaven. The air was fragrant with the aroma of ripening fruit, for grapes hung in rich clusters on trellises and over arbors, and pears and peaches were ripening on the sunny side of the stone wall. There was an avenue of evergreen trees, formed by hemlock and spruce, so trained that they arched overhead, interlacing their boughs, and thus making an avenue of some twenty rods of delicious shade in the hot summer days. It was called "Effie's walk," because the trees had been planted on the day of her birth,-Mr. Armstrong's first child. The sun was so low that few rays of light came through the thick foliage overhead, but rich beams of his golden glory in the west made the, perspective very fine as Richard Arm- strong entered the walk from the eastern entrance. It was so beautiful that he walked slowly to en-   An Adventure.       39 joy it, when suddenly a sharp, shrill scream rang through the air and penetrated the whole avenue. So shrill it was, that every twig seemed to quiver at the sound. The man was not startled, but he stood still an instant, then seated himself on one of the rustic benches near, while a deep sigh es- caped him. "I will wait awhile," he said; but with such a look of unutterable sadness as would have made little  Ruth wonder.  He waited till the sounds gradually died away; then when silence again rested over the place, he walked slowly toward the house, and entered one of the low windows which opened to the ground from the dining - room. It was a large apartment,-the bay window filling one side of the room and overlooking the garden; the old - fashioned fire - place on the op- posite side was ornamented with carving of fruit and flowers. Over these hung a painting of a beautiful woman, so beautiful that lie or she who gazed upon it looked again and again, and re-  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7484-00000022"/> 40       My I ero. turned to look. There was a strange fascination about it. It was of a beauty somewhat rare in New England, uniting the dark, regular features of the Spanish beauties with the vivacity of ex- pression common in colder climes. It was fault- less in the contour of the face, in the roundness of the beautiful arm and the delicacy of the hand with its tapering fingers. Connoisseurs might pronounce it a fancy picture,-a creation, or rather a composition of the artist, in. which the perfect features of -many were combined in one face. There were other pictures in the room, most of them fruits and flowers, with one hunting piece; but one little cabinet picture, so small as not to attract the stranger's eye, hung opposite the master's seat at table. It was the portrait of a little girl, unlike in feature and form to the lady over the mantel, for it was a type of pure, Saxon beauty,-blue eyes, soft hued hair, and a fair, sunny complexion. It wassweet, but with a shade of sadness which should not have dwelt   An Adventure.       41 in a face so young. It seemed as though the seriousness of life had come top soon. The furniture of the room was of mahogany, dark and polished by age, nothing modern, not even the carpet, which was a Turkey rug, with its rich colors massed in strange combinations and quaint bordering. The table was laid for two persons; the tea service was of solid silver of a very ancient pattern, as was the quaint china. A pleasant - faced Irish girl was bringing in the supper when Mr. Armstrong entered. "Is it over, Katie?" he asked. "Yes, sir; she is quiet now.  She was wanting Master Lloyd.' The gentleman made no reply, but passed into the hall and upstairs to a chamber on the south 'side of the house. A lady sat at the window be- fore a table on which lay a large, open Bible. She was reading aloud, and the only notice which she took of the entrance of Mr. Armstrong was to raise her voice, and continue to read in slow,   &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7484-00000023"/> 42        fMy Hero. clear, ringing tones the following verses from the Psalms: "Let them be as chaff before the wind, and let the angel of the Lord chase them." "Let their way be dark and slippery; and let the angel of the Lord persecute them." There was a pause, and then the voice began again; "As for those that compass me about, let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits from which they can not rise." "My enemy has rewarded me evil for good, and given me hatred for my love; therefore let his prayer become a sin; let"-- here there was a sudden pause. Mr. Armstrong, who was in the little dressing room, changing his clothes, said,-- "We will stop there if you please, and go down to tea." The lady was dressed in black; she turned towards him. Could this be the original of the   An Adventure.       43 picture in the dining-room? It is the same, and yet not the same ;-the eyes, the mouth, the contour of the head, the rich, black hair, but over all has passed,-not merely ten years of life, which from the ages of twenty to thirty only ripens and matures beauty,-but, as a biting winter's frost has shorn the leaves from a tree which we have sketched in its spring freshness, leaving it without one bough broken, one twig the less, but still not so fair a sight to look upon. It has the same contour, the same swaying branches and interlacing boughs, but it stands now rugged and stern against a wintry sky, with no whispering welcome for the summer breeze, no charm of glossy greenness to woo the kiss of sunbeams or shade the playing child. Such was the difference between the stately woman who sat hurling with terrible distinctness those sentences of wrath against some enemy, and the picture in the dining- room below. "Will you go down to tea with me?" said  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7484-00000024"/> "       My Hero.

Go, infidel!" she said, " atheist I blasphem- er I I will not drink of your cup nor eat of your bread. Give me back my child and the wealth which I brought to you, and let me never see you more." He went out of the room, and came down stairs to eat supper alone, first ordering Katie to take some tea and toast to her mistress. As he sat, the picture of little Effie was before him, the sweet child whom death had taken. As he gazed at it he said to himself,-"If it were true-only, if it were true I If I could meet once more in a world beyond, the dear one who seems   An Adventure.       45 almost to speak from the picture, and her who lived again in this child,-my mother?

No, no; there is no life beyond this!"And he rose and went out into the garden.  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7484-00000025"/> CHAPTER II EXPLANATIONS. Seven corpses lay on the shining sands- On the shining sands when-the tide went down; And the women are weeping and wringing their hands, For those who will never come back to the town, For men must work, and women must weep; And there's little to save, and many to keep, Though the harbor bar be moaning." TWENTY -FIVE    years before  the commencement --of  our  story, Jacob Stirling, senior, not "Grandpa Stirling" then, but a man of middle age, hale and hearty, rose from his bed early in the morning, as was his habit, and drew aside the curtain from the window looking eastward. The whole hori- /   Explanations.       47 zon was enveloped in a thick mist, in which he found no little meaning. "There is a storm brewing, Lucy," he said to his wife; " the north -east wind blows, and this fog comes from the stormy Bay of Fundy." In 'a few hours the mist turned to rain, the wind blew fiercely. All night the rain fell, and the storm increased in violence. At that time Jacob Stirling, senior, was part owner of a brig then a little overdue from Liverpool, and he was sure that no vessel could ml port in that gale. If she, were out in mid - ocean she was safe; but if near shore, there was great danger that she might be driven against the rocks and dashed to pieces. The tides were unusually high at that time of the moon; and all day long the hoarse murmur of the waves could be heard for some miles inland. On the second day, Jacob Stirling went down to the water side three miles from his house, making his way with difficulty in the teeth of the fierce wind and driving rain. The water was breaking  &#xD;<pb n="48" xml:id="VAC7484-00000026"/> 48        My Hero. in great waves over the road running by the water side, and flinging its salt spray to the roofs of the houses on' the upper side of the street. Large masses of sea - weed, fragments of lumber, floating wood from scattered wood-piles were tossed here and there by the angry waves. Many families had vacated their houses, which were inundated by the water, and in danger of being carried away at any moment. There is a long, low, sandy island, a short distance from the shore, and near the mouth of the river on which vessels had formerly been wrecked. The island is formed of shifting sands with which the ocean plays gently in the sun- shine but tosses furiously in its anger. Two light - houses have been erected here to war the sailor from its treacherous coast, but it was feared that these beacons would themselves be destroyed, as they had once before 'been leveled to the ground by the violence of the wind. A bridge connects this island to the main - land. Two  &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-49" xml:id="VAC7484-00000027"/> J: twohundred yards from land." Page 49.,   Explanations.       49 brave men, accustomed to the perils of the sea, thought they discerned the outlines of a brig through the mist and rain, and crossed this bridge about midday. They had scarcely landed on the island, when the bridge itself was lost to sight in the whelming waters; but the vessel so faintly discerned before was now visible in the offing, and, as the two men gazed at her, their practiced eye saw the mainmast give way, and the vessel, at the mercy of the wind and waves, strike on a reef two hun- dred yards from land. Those on board the ship saw the men on shore, and signals were exchang- ed. For two hours those two brave fellows re- mained in the surf, trying to catch the rope which the sailors were throwing towards the shore. They perhaps would never have succeeded, had not a man who lived near the southern extremity of the island come to their assistance. In about an hour after he joined them, they secured the rope, and all on board were saved. There were  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7484-00000028"/> nn50       Jl kero 50        MjleV. nine in all; one pasnger only, and he a boy of some fourteen years of age. He was so much exhausted when they brought him ashore, that it was feared, for a few minutes, he would nev- er evive. He was taken into a hut which had been built for the accommodation of shipwrecked sailors. Here, under the kind care of those who had rescued him, he was so far recovered that, towards evening, they brought him to the city. Mr. Stirling was at the hotel when the rescued men were taken there, and at once became -inter- ested in the boy. He was a bright, intelligent lad, with large brown eyes and fair skin. It was evident, from the delicacy of his hands, and in- deed from his whole appearance, that he had not been used to labor. The good Quaker laid his hand kindly on his shoulder.

"My mother died, Sir, and I could noti forget her as my fatier did; and so I came away from home to seek my fortune in the new world. They will not miss me, Sir." "Aye! Aye! thee little knows a father's heart. Thee will be sadly missed and. moaned, my lad," said the old gentleman as he looked kindly on the handsome boy. "Has thee any money, Robert?" "I had a hundred dollars in my chest, Sir, but it has gone with the vessel I suppose. It was my own money, which my mother gave me before she died." "And what can thee do in this new world, *    ,      -  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7484-00000029"/> 52       lAMy Hero. Robert?"And there was a keen look that went with the kind word. "I can work, Sir. I am strong and healthy, I was never sick in my life." There was something in this boy that interested the old gentleman exceedingly. He could not turn his mind from him, even in his anxiety for the fate of his brig. He constituted himself, at once, the child's protector, and said to him,- "If thee is willing, I will take thee to my home till thee can do better." The boy thanked him, adding, that he hoped he should not be long a trouble to him. Night came on, but few could sleep. The sea moaned heavily all through the dark hours, and many prayers went up for the sailors on those angry waters. The next morning, a sad scene was presented to the eye. A large brig had struck during the night, and those who watched on shore could see the poor sailors clinging to the wreck, but could not aid them. -.   Explanations.       53 No boat could live in that tempest-tossed surf, and the brig was too distant to 'throw lines to the shore. Some of the men on the brig tried to es- cape by the boat, but their dead bodies were after- wards found on the beach with the boat near them. Seven bodies of the crew were found, besides those of the captain and mate. These last were recognized and taken away by friends. One who was present at the funeral of the stranger corpses thus describes it: "They were borne into the broad aisle of the ancient church,-the American flag thrown over their coffins, -the bells tolled,- and, amid a concourse of twenty- five hundred people, prayer was offered over these human waifs thus thrown upon our shores. They were then borne by the hands of strangers to the old burying hill, while the bells tolled and the flags drooped at half- mast from the eessels in their nmoorings, --seven sailors borne to their rest, while the harbor bar was moaning,"  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7484-00000030"/> 54        My Hero. As Jacob Stirling stood very close by these, with the little stranger at his side, he said,- "Robert, thee might have been like one of these. They are taken, and thy life spared. Does thee not think thy father would weep to see thee lying dead like these poor men?" "He used to love me, Sir." "And does now, boy. May God show thee some day a father's heart. Come, now, we will go home. The gains of twenty years of my life are gone with yonder brig, but I can not mourn the loss of earthly goods in the presence of these dead." A short ride brought them to the Stirling Farm. The storm had ceased, the sky was se- renely blueijnd there was a breath of coming spring in the air as they stopped at the side porch. The wife and child,--a boy about two years younger than Robert Johns,-came to meet them. They had remained at home during the storm,   Exclanations.       55 and were eager to have news from town. There was something in the large, soft eyes and fair face of the stranger boy that brought a welcome with him; but when Lucy Stirling learned that his mother was 'dead, and that he had run away from home, her kind heart went out towards him, and she bade him welcome to her house. Jacob Stirling the second was a gentle, quiet boy, only too glad to have a playmate, but inwardly filled with wonder at the thought of a boy, not far from his own age, daring to run away from home, and crossing the ocean. He was a little shy, at first, of such a companion. A few hours afterwards, when the boy had gone to led, and Jacob Stirling sat with his wife by the fireside, he said,- "And so, Lucy, we are as poor as when we began life together. Thank God, we have the farm left us. I care little for money save for thy sake."  , "Jacob, it is a good thing to be blessed in  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7484-00000031"/> '56       Mfy Hero. basket and store. I am sorry thee has lost, but when I think of the poor wives whose husbands were lost in thy vessel, I feel that our affliction is light." "But, Lucy, I have not only returned a poor man, but I have brought a burden to thee also." "If thou meanest the boy, Jacob, do not be troubled. I am glad thee was kind to the moth- erless lad. I like his face and his ways." "I do not like his running away from his father." "He is not a bad boy, Jacob. We will not judge him harshy." "But we must communicate with his father, Lucy. The boy has spirit, I think, and may have done wrong; if so, we must lead him in the right way." Meantime the two boys had gone to bed to- gether, and all little Jacob's fears were removed by seeing Robert kneel for a few minutes by the side of the bed, before undressing himself. -.If  (   Excplanations.      57 Had lie known that it was simply fulfilling a promise made to a mother now dead, and from no higher motive, he might not have had so much confidence in the stranger; but as it was, the act itself put Jacob's heart quite at ease. Robert was very tired. The last three days had been full of terror to him. Such a storm visits our coast but seldom, and it was a new and terrible experience to the child. He was very thankful for this quiet shelter and comfortable bed, and fell into so sound a sleep that he scarcely moved till Jacob awoke at dawn and sprang out of bed. Robert turned over, murmured something in his sleep, and throwing his arms above his head, fell into a slumber as deep as that from which he had been partially aroused. Two hours passed, Jacob had helped his father in the barn and stables, and both had come in to the breakfast which was ready for the table, and yet no Robert appeared.  Lucy Stirling went up to his room. He was still asleep, the arms J'  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7484-00000032"/> 58       My Hevo. thrown over his head, the button of Jacob's night - shirt which she had given him being a little too tight in the neck, the band was- left loose, and she saw how fair and white was the neck, while the dark brown hair lay in clustering curls on his forehead. He was a beautiful boy, towards which any mother's heart might warm, but there were traces of tears on his cheeks now,-tears which nothing could have induced him to shed in the presence of others. Lucy Stirling dropped the curtain over the win- dow where the eastern sun came in, and then gently laid the boy's arms by his side, saying to herself, "It is n't well to sleep so," and think- ing his sleep was very sound, softly kissed him on his forehead.- He stirred, and a smile passed over his face.

We had a pleasant voyage, till we reached the Massachusetts' coast, when a terrible storm wrecked the ship, and the crew barely escaped with their lives. We were brought to shore by three brave men who risked their lives to save us. I was kindly cared for by a Quaker gentleman, who took me to his own house. I am here at present, in a good home, and wish to stay, as they assure me I can pay my way by my own labor. I think that Mr. Stirling wishes me to say that I am sorry that I left my home. I can not tell a lie. I would rather have been drowned in that terrible storm than go back, but if my departure has caused you unhappiness, it will give me pain. "Yours respectfully, "BOBERT JOHNS." This letter did not quite satisfy Jacob Stirling. He would have liked a more affectionate demon- stration on  the part of the child towards the father, but he merely said,- "Robert, I hope thy next letter will be more kindly written." 2   '    Explanations.         61 "I may never receive an answer to this," was Robert's reply.  This letter was enclosed in the following: "ROBERT JOHNS, SOLICITOR,-LINCOLN'S INN FIELDS, "ONDON: "Thy son has found a home with me. He seems to us a good boy, isobedient and willing to work. Whatever the cause which has estranged him from home, he carefully guards the secret, but his aversion to returning is so great that I advise thee not to lay thy commands upon him. I know the heart of a father, and therefore believe thee has suffered much at the loss of thy boy. He seems not to have a bad heart, and will no doubt see his error, if thee will but give him time and thyself patience. I will watch him, and Lucy, my wife, will supply a mother's place, as far as lies in her power. "Thy friend, "JACOB STIRLING," At that time there were no steamers so swift as to carry letters across the Atlantic in seven or eight days, and therefore no answer was looked for from these letters for four months at least. There was a good school in the neighborhood, one of those schools common even in the smaller towns in New England, where boys can be thoroughly drilled in mathematics and the lansr  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7484-00000034"/> 62        My Ilero. guages, and make as good progress, perhaps, as in the more vaunted and endowed schools of Eng- land. Robert and Jacob were both scholars here; Jacob Stirling, the elder, insisting upon this for the spring term of three months. Robert Johns was a quick, apt scholar, keep- ing at the head of his classes, and liked by the boys. They knew little of him, however, out of school hours, for he never lingered for a moment when school was dismissed, but went directly home and to his work in the barn or garden. The truth was, that the boy had a proud spirit and could not brook the sense of obligation, and determined that, if possible, he would pay his friends for their generosity to him. The boys thought him too quiet, a little tame, a good scholar, but not much of a fellow after all. But, one morning, they came to alter their mind. The school- room was open at eight o'clock, one hour before school - time, but the rules required that no scholar should speak aloud ornmake any   Explanations.       63 disturbance after entering the house, that those who wished might study in quiet. All who pre- ferred to play must do so in the play - ground. This rule was strictly enforced; many of the boys were in their seats, and more than half the girls, one morning, and, as examination -was near, there was an unusual amount of study. Robert Johns was working out a difficult sum in the Rule of Three, and oblivious of everything else, when Jim Bell, the swaggerer and torment of the whole school, a great, lubberly fellow, strong as an ox and brutal as a savage, came up the aisle behind Robert, and with a well aimed blow felled him to the floor. Quick as a flash of lightning, Robert sprang to his feet, closed with his enemy, and being more supple, and having evidently received a few lessons in boxing across the water, laid his opponent on the floor with a bleeding nose and a bruised face. Hurra!. three cheers for Robert Jdhns!" was sounded through the school.  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7484-00000035"/> "      AMy Hero. You called him a spooney, did n't ye, Jim Bell? And so he is, for he has spooned you, you mean rascal, to attack a fellow in the rear!" The master coming in at this instant, a sudden silence fell upon the school. Jim sneaked out and was seen no more that day. Robert- had turned to his book without even looking around him or appearing to hear the hurra of the boys. Jacob, who had been taught the doctrine of non - resistance, had watched the affair with .a troubled face, but even he could not repress his pleasure at Robert's victory. On their way home he said,-- "If thee must fight, Robert, I am glad thee came off best." "It is high time the bully was thrashed," said Robert. "I had determined, the next time that he called Susan Hopkins 'Suke,' that I'd give him a lesson." Jacob smiled, and, forgetful of home instruc- tion, said,-    Explanations.       65 "I wish thee would, Robert. But how can thee beat him who is so much stronger than the other boys?" "It is the trick of the thing, Jacob. I will give you a few lessons some day." While the boys are thus occupied in school and on the farm, we will go back a few moments to Robert's English home. In a pleasant old - fashioned house on the Pen- tonville road, not far from London, a gentleman sat in his library with two or three open letters on the table before him. He was past fifty years of age, tall and of slender build, his hair gray and his aspect grave. He looked pale, and was evi- dently not in health. He read one of the letters, laid it on the table, waited a moment and then re- read it. This he did again and again. ' God be thanked," he said aloud; " but the boy little knew how I loved him. How I have longed to look upon his face, so like that of his mother. He was in the right, and I was - a fool. Yet a  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7484-00000036"/> "         ,My Hero. father shrinks from confessing this to his child." He rose and walked the room, then returned to the table and read over for the third or fourth time Jacob Stirling's letter.  "The boy has found a better home than he left; this Quaker must be a good man.   I will make my  confession to him. He can tell the boy as much as in his wisdom he thinks best. Why is it that the best men in the world are the most charitable to the erring?" He took his pen and wrote rapidly: "JACOB STIRLNG: "D DEAR SI :-Your letter of April 13th has just come to hand, and would have been answered before, but for my absence on the continent. You are right in your judgment of the boy, and I, his father, am in fault. I will tell you the truth, for no false shame shall now prevent my open- ing my heart to you. His mother was one of the loveliest wom- en God ever made, a Christian whose daily life was perfumed with pure thoughts and good deeds. I can notnow understand my own infatuation, only that I find other men withgray hairs erring in the same way; but in about a year after the death of my wife, I was wonby the pretty face of a young woman, many years my junior, and married her, bringing her home to take a mother's place to my boy. I had no reason to complain of Robert; he treated herrespectfully, but became silent and was too reticent for his years. I found, before many months   ,Explanations.          67 had passed, that my position and fortune had been the lure for the pretty bird which had come so willingly to my gilded cage. She wanted a great deal ofmoney. I supplied her liberally, but it now seems that there were debts which she had incurred before marriage, and of which she had kept me ignorant. "I had always trusted Robert with the keys of my desk; he was my friend and confidant till after my second marriage. But I began to miss sums of money from my desk,-small at first, then occasionally larger sums. I was troubled. It did not once occur to me that my wife would take money in this way; for she was never denied, and I was in the habit of replenish- ing her purse every week. "I can recall now how gradually, and yet how surely, she weakened my confidence in my child, and led me to believe that he was not trustworthy. I was distressed beyond meas- ure, and knew not what to do. Robert has a quick spirit, and if I accused him falsely, I knew that I should rouse a slumber- ing lion; but if such a fault was not checked by a strong, quick remedy, what would become of my boy? I spoke of the loss of the money to him, and his reply was,- L" 'Father, I am sure our servants are trusty; you know they iebeen in our home for many years.' i"Wy did I not comprehend him? I see it now, since I know Here it had gone. It was about the time that he pur- chased a s all boat and sculls, and did not come to mie for means to pay for them. I had forgotten that he had a hundred pounds in the Bank, which his mother had given him.  (' One morning I laid a fifty pound note in my desk, leaving the key in my wife's dressing room. There were some smaller notes in the desk, but this one had been handed me by a sailor, who had been accused ofmutiny, and came to me for counsel.  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7484-00000037"/> 68         My Hero. I had my doubts about its being genuine, and was suspicious that, if it were, he came by it dishonestly. I therefore put a private mark upon it, and laid it aside for further examination. At night, when I returned home, the note was missing. Robert was in bed and asleep, but the key was found in his pocket. I sent for him to the library, and-but I shudder when I remember my passion and my hard words. "I declared that, on the morrow, he should be sent to Ben- wood, a sort of Reformatory school, where he should remain two years, or I would let the law take its course for his crime. 'Go back to your room,' I repeated, harshy. ' Let me hear no further protestations of innoeence, for the proof is too strong against you.' These were my last words. I have not seen my child since that hour. Two days after his disap- pearance, I received a call at my office from the agent of Bell &amp; White, jewelers in the Strand. He handed me the fifty pound note,-the same which had been taken from my desk, for it bore my private mark. I see,' he said, 'that this note bears one of the numbers of the notes stolen from the London Bank, about four weeks ago. As your wife paid it to us, we bring it here, knowing that your profession brings you in con- tact with rogues, and we may thus be able to trace the thief.' I took the note, and I knew where to lay hands on the sus- pected man, but, alas a sudden suspicion filled my heart with terror. I called for my wife's bill, it bore date a year previous to our marriage. I am a man of hasty temper. I went home and confronted my wife with the bill and the note. She was taken by surprise. There vas no time to invent a subterfuge, and she finally confessed ler guilt with many tears and prayers to be saved exposure. i left her and returned to the city, where I made preparations to go to the continent, (   Explanations.         69 hoping to find my 6oy with his uncle, his mother's brother, who was residing in Germany. Of course I was unsuccessful, but lingered, loth to return to a home that had become so des- olate. Business, at last, called me back, and I found your letter which had been waiting for me so long. I thank God that my child has fallen into your hands. I write him by this mail. He has much to forgive. His father's heart and home are open to him, and I enclose a check, as you will perceive, for his use. With many thanks for your kindness, I am, "Yours respectfully, "ROBERT JOHXNs." Mr. Johns had closed his letter and was on -his way to a Banking    House for his check, when a sudden idea seized him.  "I will go myself," he said; "I must see my boy."    Before the week was over, the gentleman was on his way to the United States. Meanwhile, Robert had given up the hope of receiving any reply to his letter. The subject was not mentioned in his presence, but Jacob Stirling once said to his wife,--"Lucy, does thee think the boy has told an untruth?" "Jacob, thou knowest it is not in his nature." "But, Lucy, a father's heart is tender towards his own child."  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7484-00000038"/> 70        My Hero. "Thee judges other men by thyself, Jacob; and who knows if thee would resist temptation if thy wife were taken from thee." The sturdy Quaker, with his broad - brimmed hat, his calm face, and his farmer's frock, looked earnestly at his wife, while a half smile lighted his blue eyes. "Does thee forget the Pond Lily walk?" A blush suffused quiet Lucy's cheek as she recalled a time, long ago, when they betrothed themselves to each other in these Words,-"for better or for worse, -in life unto death,-yea, till both meet in a world beyond." She did not speak, but the tears stood in her eyes, and the blush still lingered on her cheek, as she extended her hand to her husband. He took it, saying as he did so, "There is no need of more words, Lucy; these are sufficient to our hearts ;" and the Quaker farmer turned to take up his basket and went into the field to dig potatoes. Robert and Jacob were still in school. One (   Explanations.       71 day, Susan Hopkins,-the daughter of a neighbor- ing farmer, also a Quaker, --Robert and Jacob were going home from school, through Apple Tree Lane, so called, because it ran through a large orchard belonging to the Stirling Farm. The blossoms had long since given place to fruit, which hung plentifully upon the boughs, and was watched with increasing interest by the children as the summer's sun touch d them with gold and red; but to - day all subjects of minor importance were forgotten in discussing the school examina- tion which was soon to take place. "It is of no use, trying to get ahead of thee, Robert Johns," said Susan. "Thee is ahead in Grammar, in Arithmetic and in History." "But not in spelling, Susan," said Robert. "You are the best speller in the school." "Thee can't deny it," said Jacob; "thee will get the prize there." "If Jane Brown does n't- study very hard, per- haps I may; she failed in potato this morning."  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7484-00000039"/> i  -   .  itLy lero. "Potato!" said Robert, anybody can spell that; but when it comes to phthisics, I tell you, I'm lost, and give it up." "Spell potatoes, Robert," said Susan. P-o-t-a-t-o-e-s," said Robert, " poor Tim can go that." (Tim was a half-witted fellow who came to school.) "Now spell it in the singular number, Robert," said the little girl. "P-o-'a-t-o-e," said Robert. "Go down to the foot of the class, Robert Johns," said Susan, imitating exactly the words and tone of the master. "It is no credit to a young man to spell correctly, but a great dis- credit to misspell the common words of the Eng- lish tongue." The boys laughed merrily. "Thee shall be teacher, and we will go to school to thee," said Jacob. Just then the sound of a horse's feet was heard in the lane behind them. The children turned and   -Explanations.      73. saw a gentleman on horseback riding towards them. A stranger was not often seen in that re- tired part of the country, and they stopped by the side of the road under the trees till he should pass them. Robert, after the first glance, stood still an instant, gave one steady look at the traveler, and then disappeared. Jacob and Susan were so intent in their eagerness to learn who had come to the farm, that they did not notice Robert's flight. The tall, grave man stopped when he perceived the children, and inquired the way to Jacob Stirling's house. "A little way to the right, where thee sees the brown chimneys," said Jacob. "I will open the gate for thee into the main road." "Thank you, my boy," said the stranger, as Jacob opened and shut the gate, and then pointed %o the house. He turned to look for Robert, but he was no where to be seen, at which the boy wondered much. He ran home quickly, think- ing that Robert had taken a shorter cut across the  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7484-00000040"/> 74        My Hero. orchard. But when he came into the house, he found the gentleman in conversation with his father, and learned that he was Robert Johns, senior, arrived only that day from England. "And now thee will find Robert," said his father. 'But this was more easily said than done. Search was made in orchard and field, and Jacob even took the horse and rode through all the wood- land, calling Robert's name, but there was no response. The whole family were much dis- tressed, and Mr. Johns could not conceal his grief and disappointment. He had caught one glance of his boy in the orchard lane, and that he feared would be his last. When evening came, he had a long conference with Jacob Stirling, and gave him the letter which he had written, and which he still carried with him. "Thee has done wrong, Robert Johns. I see now why thy boy fears to meet thee; he inherits thy spirit, and thee hast wounded him deeply."   Explanations.       75 "Robert will not leave us so," said Lucy. "I shall hear from thy boy; it is late, go to thy bed and see what comfort the morning will bring to thee." As the household were retiring for the night, little Jacob went into the barn to look at ,Silver- tail that he had rode rather hard for some hours, as much also for his own comfort as that of the colt. Silvertail was a great favorite with the boys. They looked upon the beautiful creature as mingling in all their employments and un- derstanding what they said. Robert had taught him a great many little tricks; among others, to open and shut the gate, to raise his front foot to shake hands with him, to lay his head on his shoulder and listen when he said, "I want to whisper to you, Silvertail." - The colt returned this affection with interest. He manifested his love for Robert in a hundred ways that those only who love animals and live with them much can understand. Jacob could not sleep without  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7484-00000041"/> 76       My Hero. telling Silvertail of his trouble. He went into his stall and threw his arms around his neck. "O Silvertail, what shall we do without Bobbie? I am sorry Bobbie's father has come, if, that is why Bobbie went away." Silvertail laid his head on Jacob's shoulder as if to hear a secret; but no, he wanted to tell one, and he tried to do it, but Jacob could n't under- stand. The boy only burst out crying, and cried as boys sometimes will, when they are sure no one sees or hears them. "If Bobbie only knew, Silvertail; if he only knew that his father loved him with all his heart, more than you do, Silver - tail, - and that is saying a great deal, my beauty, --if he could only hear his father say he's the noblest boy that ever lived, and I wronged him, wronged my own child, -I say, Silvertail, wouldn't Bobbie be sorry he left us without one word? And poor father looks grave and sad,- all sad but mother, and she says, -' My boy will come back. I know he Wvill come; I have-faith in (   Explanations.       " him. But 1 think we'll never see Bobbie again, - never, Silvertaill What's the matter with you? You need n't put up your foot and throw your long tail over me so. It is n't Robert that's talking." But the colt's quick ear ,had heard a sound which Jacob had failed to hear, a rustling of the hay in the loft and a footstep on the barn floor. "O Jacob! did he say that? Did my father say that,- that he had wronged me? Does he love me still? Tell me all about it, Jacob." And Robert, with his great, wistful, dark eyes, came and laid his hand on the colt, while the beautiful creature turned her head and looked at him as if she understood it, too. The old tin peaked-top lantern, full of holes, punched into diamond- shaped figures, hung upon one of the beams over the stall, and threw its broken light on the soft glossy mane and tail of the colt, and on Jacob, who had started back and leaned against the wall when he heard the voice of Robert,  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7484-00000042"/> 78        My Hero. and looked on Robert's pale face add dark eyes. "Is it thee, -thy own self, Robert? I have been all over the farm for you. I am so glad you have not gone away. Mother was right, as she always is. But thee looks pale." "Tell me, Jacob, what my father said," Robert asked. "O Robert, I do not understand it all. I only know that thy father loves thee, and has come over the ocean to tell thee he has wronged thee." "Jacob, I must go to him. I never thought my father would do that. My father is a proud man, Jacob."  "And did not Mother say that thee has a high spirit, Robert? Come and see thy father. I heard him walking back and forth in his chamber when I came out here to tell Silvertail my trouble." The boys pulled down a little new hay for Silvertail, and said good- night, and I have no doubt the colt slept better for those kind words.   Explanations.       79 When-they went into the house, all was still and dark, save Mr. Johns' tread back and forth in his room. Robert heard it and went up. He had grown taller and more robust since he left his old home. His life with the Stirlings liad called forth all the better traits of his character, and any father might well be pleased to look upon his open brow and fine features. He knocked gently at the door. It was opened at once, and father and son stood once more together. The man threw his arms around his child. "My boy, can you forgive your father?" "O Father, do not say that; please, Father, do not say that again. I was hasty, I was wrong." "No, no, my child, you knew all the time where those notes went, and you would not crimi- nate another." An, expression of pain passed over his face, whichRobert understood. "Shall we say no more about it, Father?" said Robert. "Leave it thus, my noble boy, and God bless  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7484-00000043"/> 80        llMy Hero.  you for harboring no revengeful feeling-towards your father. How like your mother you look, my child!" Tears sprang to Robert's eyes; nevertheless no happier boy could have been found that night. Mr. Johns was present at the examination which took place the next day in the little red school- house. He had reason to be proud of Robert, for he stood at the head of all his classes save one. Susan Hopkins " went-to the head" in spelling. Some of the scholars had a little sus- picion that it came about through a ruse of Jacob Stirling, but this was only asserted in whispers, but Jacob was never heedless before. The little girl having left off at the head the day before, was at the foot of the class; Jacob stood next above her; all were in line, every little toe on the crack, and all eyes were turned to the master. The prize for the best speller was a little silver medal in the shape of the half- moon, attached to a blue ribbon. Dillingswoth's Spelling Book was the   E planations.       81 test, and words were to be given out from all. parts of it. There had been but few failures, for there was ambition in those days to excel in that nowt neglected branch of education. The last minute of the half hour devoted to this study had come, and the places remained almost unchanged, so thoroughly had the scholars studied the book; but now the word February was given out. It was placed among the list of months, along with the abbreviations, and other odds and ends that come at the end of the book, and not in the regu- lar spelling columns. The word passed from one to another till it came to Jacob, who, strange to say, was looking at the opposite wall, away from the teacher's desk, and seemed not to have heard the word. "I am sorry to see one inattentive scholar," said the master. "Susan, spell the word if you can." "F-e-b-r-u-a-r-y," said Susan, em- phasizing the r, at which Mr. Johns smiled, and the children knew their mistake. / "Susan Hopkins has won the prize," said the  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7484-00000044"/> 2l My Hero. naster; come forward, Susan, and let me put he medal around your neck." Strange to say, little Jacob's blue eyes expressed Lo disappointment when he saw Susan's happy ace. The master of this school was a thorough scholar md a patient teacher. Mr. Johns left his boy mder his instruction, and in Mr. Stirling's home, nuch to the delight of Jacob, who had cried him- 3elf sick in Silvertail's stall because be supposed Robert would return to England with his father. Robert was happy at this decision, for he found i mother in Mrs. Stirling, and a firm friend in Jacob the elder, who taught him more by exam- ple than precept, that " he who ruleth his spirit is better than he who taketh a city." The master, who was himself a graduate of an English univer- sity, found Robert so apt a scholar, that he per- suaded Mr. Johns, who came over the next year to see his boy, to let him remain with him till he was fitted for college. Two years accom- -    Explanations.       83 plished this, and then, with much regret on both sides and affection which never cooled during life, Robert again crossed the Atlantic; when he en- tered Cambridge, as well fitted as most of his class. Time passed, little Jacob became of age, and took the management of the Stirling farm. Two years afterwards he brought Susan Hopkins home as his wife. The old folks welcomed her as a daughter, and life flowed with a smooth current in that quiet home. Robert gratified his father by graduating with honor. Before entering his profession, he made a short visit to the Stirling farm, where he was received as a child, and where he found his memory green, even in tile heart of Silvertail, who, the instant he heard Robert's whisper, laid his head on his shoulder, held up his right foot, and by various antics testi- fied that, though raised in all Quaker simplicity and quietness, he had not learned the repression and quiet demeanor of hisgguardians.  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7484-00000045"/> 84        My Hero. Robert, on his return, studied law, and became a pattern of his father. He married early in life, that he might have a home of his own. It proved not only a happy one for himself, but a quiet resting - place for his father who had long before ceased to expect peace in his own house. His domestic troubles shortened his days, and he died in two years after Robert's marriage. In his will was found a bequest to Jacob Stirling, of Stirling Farm, Newhury, U. S.,- a bequest which led Jacob Stirling, senior, to say to his wife,- "Lucy, the loss of the brig, with so much of our worldly treasure in it, has proved one of the greatest blessings of our lives. We thought young Robert's love made up for the loss, but now God has sent the gold and silver, too." It was this money which enabled Jacob to keep his farm in that order with which we have intro- duced it to the reader, and which is attractive and profitable, with fruit and shade trees, and all the modern improvements of husbandry. ( Robert   Explanations.       85 Johns had been married but eight years when his wife died, leaving one child, a little girl, the Ruth of our story. In the first terrible grief at his loss,-his heart turned to the quiet old farm-house where the sorrow of his childhood had found such consolation. He took little Ruth and came thither. Here he found the same kind, motherly face to greet him, more kind and tender he thought with the added years, and the voice of the good elder Jacob, bearing as of old the words of wisdom,- ' Robert, thee must not sorrow as one without hope; thy wife shall be restored to thee." Susan opened her arms to little Ruth, and the child lay in her bosom and was comforted. Her father left her on his return to England, where business would call him to travel on the conti- nent. Here she had remained, a loved and lov- ing little thing, unspoiled, only because of the true love they bore her, and the sense of respon- sibility which so generally rests on heads of fam-  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7484-00000046"/> 86        My Hero. ilies in the quiet but conscientious community of Friends. Jacob Stirling, the third, was the only child of Susan. He was a thoughtful child, fond of the woods and the sea, preferring to study out of doors than in the school-room, and yet without the rude ways of most boys who climb trees and row boats, and like to live in the open air. He was healthy and strong, but few could look on those large, dark eyes of his, without feeling that he seemed to see more than other children of his own age. This chapter brings the Stirling family to the time of their first introduction to the reader, In the next we will resume our history of the group we met on the sea-shore. ;    CHAPTER III.

But Rich- ard Armstrong was not soothed by it. He turned, after emerging from the garden path into an open space, and looked towards his home,-the home of his fathers, a rare old home in this country, where so few care to remain in the house their fathers built, or on the land where their sepulchers $  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7484-00000047"/> 88        My Hero. are made. The building was in shadow; the tall trees, now full of foliage, gave a somber look at this time of the day to the whole side of the long, irregular building. A faint light gleamed from a solitary window, and a shadow was seen behind the white curtain. Richard Armstrong noticed it, and a look of gloom settled on his face, as he hurried down the path towards the river, where his boat was still moored under the willow tree. He loosed it and rowed himself on the darkening waters, against the tide. The hard work seemed to suit him; for, though wind and tide were against him, he rowed onward, nor felt any fatigue from his work. The waves increased in volume and hight, and threw their spray over the boat as it rose and fell above their sharp crests. He had gone some miles towards the mouth of the river, when a little island appeared at the left. It was well wooded, and there were a few houses upon it, with their little gardens and orchards) Fishing Ibolts were o     Richard Armstrong.      89 lying near the rocks with which the beach was strewn, and here and there a man or boy was seated near his boat, preparing his bait of. menhaden, that he might supply the neighboring city with fish for breakfast. Richard Armstrong rowed around to a little green point of land upon the western side of the island; and securing his boat to an iron fastened to one of the rocks, walked up the bank to a neat little house, the- windows of which commanded a view'of the harbor and the ocean beyond. There was a garden in front of the house, now gay with autumn flowers, asters, nasturtiums, marigolds; while all around the premises the barberry hung its scarlet fruit. He opened the door without knocking, and entered. A plain, motherly wom- an of sixty sat knitting by the side of a small bed on which a young boy lay sleeping. A lamp, on a small round table, was so placed as to pre- vent the light from falling on the child's features, but one could easily see the pale face and the,  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7484-00000048"/> 90       M2y Hero. sunken eyes, which told too plainly that the child was an invalid. Richard Armstrong walked with a light step that he might not disturb the sleeper, and took a seat by its side, leaning one arm on the bed and looking earnestly at the face of the little one. "He is better, Martha?" he said, with a quiv- ering interrogatory in his voice. "Yes, Mr. Richard, he is better. I told you this morning that I thought he would pick up and be a smart little fellow yet; but it will take time; you must not be impatient." "I will be patient, Martha; only assure me that he will not die. He is very young; I can wait; only tell me that he will live." "Life and death are in the hands of the Lord, Mr. Richard. I can not foresee the future, but 1 will nurse the child, and serve you faithfully as I did your mother before you. Look at the little fellow; do n't you see he has the Armstrong mouth and chin? But he do n't look so muchk like your   Richard Armstrong.      91 mother as Effie did." She carried the full family likeness in her face. At the mention of that name, Richard Arm- strong started, and turned towards the door. "You must pardon. me, Mr. Richard; and yet why should we not speak of the dead? Your mother used to bid me come into her room to sit with her, after your father's death, and would say,--'Now, Martha, tell me all about my hus- band's finding you. I like to hear you tell it, for it brings the dear man right before me.' And I want to tell the story to you this evening, because something has happened to bring it all fresh to my memory. Please sit down in the chair close to little Richard, and let me talk awhile." Mr. Armstrong sat down, more to humor the old nurse than from any desire -to hear her talk. "You know, Master Richard, that my mother was a poor Irish widow who came from the old country to earn a living for herself and child. I was only three years old, but I remember all about  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7484-00000049"/> 92        My Hero. it. We were passengers in the steerage of a great ship, and there were many ladies and gen- tlemen in the cabin (that was before the steam- ships began to run).  The emigrants were crowded, and some of them not over cleanly in their habits, and-the food spoiled because we were kept back by contrary winds, and at last the fever broke out. My mother, who was a nice, tidy woman, was very active in waiting upon the sick, and did n't get much sleep for many days and nights. At last, the fever took her, and she lay very sick. When she knew she must die, she kept asking the Lord to take care of me. One day the steward of the vessel, who was a kind- hearted man, came down to see what could be done for the poor sufferers in this gloomy place. 'What would you like, my poor woman,' he said to my mother. 'Some cold water, and a minis- ter to pray with me,' she' replied. 'I 'll do my best for you,' he said, and he sent her some ice- water at once, and it did her some good; and   Richard Armstrong.     93 after a while your father came down. 'I am not a minister, my good woman, but if it will be any comfort, I will pray for you, that you may recov- er,' he said. "'No sir,' she replied, 'I do not ask for that, because it is the Lord's will I should die. I know enough about the fever to know that I can live but a few hours. I want you to ask the Lord that he will take care of my poor child here. When I die she will have no friend in the wide world.' "Your father, who was a fine, handsome man, then knelt down by that miserable little bed in the steerage, and asked God to bless my poor, dying mother, and take me under His fatherly care. When he rose from his knees, Mother looked very happy. 'Thank you, Sir,' she said. I will trust her with God.' Your father stopped a moment, looked at me, curled up at my moth- er's side, and said, "'I will take care of your child; she shall have a good home in my house.'  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7484-00000050"/> "       My Hero. "Mother said,--'The Lord bless you. I die in peace.' These were her last words. Your father took me away out of that dark, dirty place, and bore me in his arms to the deck of the vessel. There, I have heard say, a lady passenger made me some clothes from her own garments, and though I cried awhile for my mother, I forgot my troubles, as children will, and learned to love your father with my whole heart. I never left him till he died, at seventy years of age. I nursed him in his last sickness, and heard him say,- 'Martha, I bless the day I brought you up out of that dismal steerage; you have always been a com- fort to me,- though,' he added, and I can see his smile as he said it,-' what in the world to do with a little girl baby in that great ship was a poser to me; but I got through it without trouble, and here you are, Martha, to take care of me in my second childhood.' "'I bless the Lord that he answered my moth- er's prayer,' I said to hinr.   Richard Armstrong.      95 "'Aye, Martha, while I was praying, the words of a quaint old writer occurred to me,-"Answer your own prayers; " and then I thought it' my du- ty to provide for you.' Now, you see, Mr. Rich- ard, here I am, with the Lord's blessing, in this snug little home, given me by your father, nurs- ing your boy, his grandchild. But I had almost forgotten to tell you what brought this fresh to my mind to - day. Just about sundown, a party that had been spending the day at the beach, stopped here on their way up the river, to get some of my distilled rose- water, the ladies fancying that it is good for weak eyes and burned faces. Among them was a beautiful girl, who came into the house, and when she saw little Richard, she stopped to speak to him, and he asked her if she -put gold on her hair, and told her he liked to look at her. She asked his name, and when I said, Richard Armstrong, she kissed him again, and told the little fellow that her father saved her life that afternoon, and he made her tell the story  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7484-00000051"/> 96        My Hero. over and over again; and when she bade him good- bye, she said, God bless you, my darling, and make you strong and well.' The prayer came from her heart, I know, for the tears were in her eyes; and when I said, 'Do pray for him, Miss; I believe in prayer,' she said, 'So do I, Ma'am; I will pray on my bended knees, night and morn- ing, for the darling, and I will come and see him, too, if he wishes it.' "Please come soon, pretty lady,' little Dick said; and see, he has gone to sleep with a ring she gave him; he called it pretty when she held his hand, and she drew it right off and gave it to him. I strung the pretty thing on a little blue ribbon, and he went to sleep while looking at it." "Martha," said Mr. Armstrong, t do you think that-by any possible chance,-you know whom I mean, will find out where the child is, and come for it?" Martha raised her head, and sat straight and square in her seat, looking as if ready to shoulder   Richard Armstrong.      97 arms in defense of her charge, and repel all assail- ants, whoever they might be. 'Never, Mr. Richard; she will never come here; or if by any chance she should, she will find me prepared. It would be death to the child." "I know it's hard," said Mr. Armstrong; " no doubt she loves the child; but I dare not, more, I will not risk the boy with her. One victim is enough." "Too much, Mr. Richard.  When a mother can not deny herself for her child, even to cutting- off a right hand or plucking out a right eye, she is unworthy to be a mother." Martha's eyes flashed, and it was evident that she believed what she said. Richard Armstrong sat by the side of his child till towards midnight, when the moon rose and tle tide began to turn, then, after one long, earnest look at the sleeper, he turned away and sought his boat; and now he sat idly in the stern  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7484-00000052"/> 98         tyJ Hero. and floated with the tide. The moon rose higher and poured its light on shore and sea, one receiv- ing it with silent joy, the other with the sparkle and dash of dancing waves and toss of jeweled spray. The solitary boatman floated on till he came to a piece of rocky coast where there seemed to have been a pitched battle between the monsters of the deep and the snakes of the land, or a grand game of base ball where immense boulders had been hurled by giant hands. The moonlight prevented any trouble in land- ing, and the surf was no obstacle to our skillful oarsman, whose light craft was easily borne over it. It was a lonely spot, nothing in sight but masses of rock and the sea, no sound but that of breaking waves. "So lone it was that God himself scarce seemed there to be." Mr. Richard Armstrong's heart was in sylmpa- thy with this awful loneliness. To him God, as a loving Father whose tender mercies arq over all   Richard Armstrong.      99 his works, was not there. To him this life was all; no mortal could put on immortality; life was not lord of death, and there was no victory over the grave. He was a scholar and a thinker, but he knew nothing of that simple, childlike trust which, in the hour of darkness and sorrow, is to the soul like the anchor to the ship. Death was to him an endless sleep, a mere change of matter, and not a continuance of conscious life. He had inherited wealth, he had been educated in the best schools of the day, he had traveled in foreign countries, and studied philosophy with the schol- ars of Germany, of whom many, in their worldly wisdom, scorn the simplicity of the fishermen of Galilee. Life had held out her richest gifts to this man, and he had grasped them only to find them apples of Sodom. Such sorrow had come to him as his philosophy failed to gauge; sorrow to which noth- ing but a sweet trust in an overruling Providence, and a firm belief in a life beyond this, where I .  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7484-00000053"/> 100    -    My Hero. loved ones meet again, could bring consolation. He sat there now, recalling the events of the day, and looking seaward with a strong protest in his heart against what he called the order of nature. Musing there, he thought; and we give these thoughts here, because we meet these same lines again in his later life, not for the poetry itself, for it'was flung out out in a sort of white heat of pain that night: ' Down the ages hear that cry, Shall man ever live again? Running through all chords of life Ever in a minor strain. By the ocean, old and hoary In her never-ending pain, Beating, beating, beating ever,' Did I ask the same again. Wild and bitter was my cry, Wrung from my despair and woe; Wilder still the hoarse rejoinder, Ours to suffer, not to know." Hours passed while Mr. Armstrong sat on this rugged, storm - beaten shore, where many a young sailor's life had gone out, tnd many a richly   Richard Armstrong.      10l freighted vessel had been wrecked. At last the light of the moon began to pale, and the long, low coast- line of the east to brighten with the coming day. Then he rose and turned his boat towards Oakwood. As he seated himself and watched the beauty of the early morn, the words of the young girl whose life he had saved, occurred to him: "I will pray for you every morning, when I pray for my father, who is on the sea.' What a singular coincidence, that she should also meet his child, the dearest object in life to him, and thus mingle them in her worship! Now Richard Armstrong did not believe in prayer. How could prayer alter the order of the great universe? Were the eternal laws of matter to be set aside for the prayer of a weak mortal? It was absurd; and yet some lingering of a moth- er's early love, some memory of that mother teaching him the first prayer of lisping infancy, -was still with him, and in this -sweet, beautifa] hour, he had no sneer on his lip, no scorn in his  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7484-00000054"/> 102        My Hero. heart for prayer. Then the fact that his child was remembered also softened him, and he smiled, saying to himself,- "Well, well; I would not disturb a delusion which brings so much of con- solation with it. If I could have the faith of Saint Paul, I would be willing to be thrown with the wild beasts of Ephesus, or die on the block. But truth is stern; why solace myself with a fal- lacy for the sake of present ease? -And yet this life is so bitter to me, I may well ask why it was given." While he is thus musing, meantime making his way slowly homeward, we will take a peep at Richard Armstrong's home. We have visited the dining-room, and the reader will remember two portraits which hung there; one, a large painting of a beautiful wom- an whose shadow we saw in the chamber above; the other, a cabinet picture of a little girl, Effie, Richard Armstrong's first - born child. And now my pen stops and lingers over the   Richard Arm2strong.     103 paper, loth to tell the sad but truthful story of a wrecked life. Not many years before the incidents of our opening chapter, Richard Armstrong, who had just returned from some years' residence in Ger- many, entered a church in one of our large cities, where art had striven to make (worship delightful to those who came to pray within its walls. The light streamed through richly stained windows, the high, grained roof reminded one of forest arches made by grand old trees, heavy velvets and satins covered the altar, while rare mu- sic rose and fell upon the perfumed air, at times sweet and low, lulling the senses into forgetful- ness of sorrow, then loud and full swelled the or- gan tones, making the heart beat quick as at the sound of victory. Richard Armstrong's lip curled. "And this is worshiping God," he said; "to my mind it is only refined sensuality;" but still he went in, and up the aisle whose soft, mossy carpet gave no  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7484-00000055"/> 104       My Hero. echo to his footfall. It was confirmation service; the bishop in his robes was surrounded by a doz- en or more young persons; among them was a young lady, who, as she removed her hat to re- ceive the water upon her forehead, struck all per- sons who were near enough to see her by her un- common beauty.  For the moment it seemed faultless. Richard Armstrong was not insensible to it. At the close of the service he inquired her name, and on learning that she was the daughter of an old friend of his father, he obtained an in- troduction, and, after a short acquaintance, mar- ried Isabella Newland, and brought her to his own home, proud of his treasure, and ready to give her the devotion of a life. He believed that the beautiful exterior was only an index of the soul. He had already entered into possession of his property. His parents were dead, and he had been an only child. He was eager to make his home a fitting place   Richard Armstrong.     105 for the wife whose beauty was the theme of the neighborhood. Every wish was gratified. For a while life was bright and its current smooth; but ere long the discovery was made that the mistress of Oakwood possessed an ungovernable temper, that a little provocation would excite her, and sometimes the storm was fearful to witness. Martha, who had remained since the death of Richard's mother, as housekeeper, and whose knowledge of housewifery and prudent manage- ment made her a blessing to the household, quietly removed herself to her home on Little Star Island, which had been willed to her by the elder Mr. Armstrong, where she might be safe from the strife of tongues, she said. This was no benefit to the young wife, who was now under no restraint save in the presence of her husband. He was aware of the infirmity, 'but ignored it as much as possible, and sought to soothe rather than irritate; but when the storm grew loud and fierce in his presence, he quietly  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7484-00000056"/> 106        My Hero. withdrew himself and devoted his time to his studies in the library. When she became a mother, and little Effie was welcomed by all the household, he said to himself,- "Now she will become gentle for the sake of the child." But alas! the weakness and confinement to the house only increased the sud- den outhursts of anger which made the home like an abode of an evil spirit. Added to this trouble, came another habit which filled the husband's heart with terror. At times his wife would manifest a strange incoherency and wildness which was unaccountable, and then a sleepy, moody state equally strange. But it was months before he could believe,-before he would allow what was evident to the servants,- that she craved the stimulus of wine daily, and in such quantities as to unsettle speech and reason. When the truth was slowly and most reluctantly forced upon him, his prouI spirit recoiled in horror. His idol was shattered, and his home   Richard Armstrong.     107 desecrated by a vice peculiarly odious to him, especially in a woman. He turned from wife to child. Little Effie seemed in person and dispo- sition like his mother, and daily grew into his love till that love became idolatry. She spent a great deal of time in the library with her father; she accompanied him in his rides on land and water, and vas his inseparable companion. She was two years old when her brother Richard was born. Then the mother, who manifested little affection for her daughter, seemed to open her heart to her son, and in her love for him re- pressed for a while the passions which had dragged her down from the position she had held in the early married days. Hoping much from this, Richard Armstrong was careful to encourage the growth of this partial mastery over a dangerqus element in a family. Effie was not aware of this, however, for she loved her little brother with all the warmth of affectionate nature, and, moreover, she passed a  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7484-00000057"/> 108        My Hero. great deal of time in the little house on Star Island, where she was always a welcome guest, and where ballads and stories never failed. The truism, that habits are second natures, was exemplified in Mrs. Armstrong. It was evi- dent, before little Dick was two years old, that his mother was no fit companion for him; he in- herited her quick temper; but if any efforts were made by the father to regulate it, the wife became furious as a wild animal. The child was in- dulged in every caprice and never thwarted, till he became a little tyrant, for whom it was diffi- cult to procure a nurse, and from whom the ser- vants fled. Thus matters stood when he was four years old, and Effie, six. The mother, still keeping much of her girlish beauty, would lie for hours  on her bed in a dull, heavy sleep, from which she would awake to call for her boy, feeding him with dainties unsuited to hie age, dressing him in rich attire, calling him pet names, whileo her little   Richard Armstrong.     109 girl was left unnoticed and uncared for, excepting by her father and the servants. Little Dick's quick temper was not improved by this course, but even that was a lesser evil than sharing his mother's daily, or rather hourly: glass of wine, which she would manage to procure, for nothing exceeds the cunning and artifice of those who are slaves to vice. One day, Effie had returned from Aunt Martha's with a quaint, old picture book, a sort of heirloom which had descended from her great grandmother. She had learned to read, and was reading "Jack and the Bean Stalk," on the upper step of the broad staircase leading to the hall. The ceilings were high, the staircase long, and the hall was finished in hard wood much carved. When Dick heard her reading, he came and seated himself by her side. "I want the book; give me the book, Effie." "No, Dickie, I can't give you the book, be- cause you will tear it; come and sit by me, and I  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7484-00000058"/> "O        My Hero. will read you about Jack's bean;" and she put' her arm around him to draw him to a seat be- side her. "No, I want the book; I will have the book;" and he proceeded summarily to possess himself of it by snatching it from her hand. But she held her treasure firmly., and he began to scream. The mother heard, and roused from her sleep on her lounge, came out. "What is it, Dickie, darling? What is naughty sister doing to make you cry?" O Mamma, he wants to tear Aunt Martha's nice book. She told me he must not have it." "I will have the book; and I'll tear it, too, if I want to; may n't I, Mother? '- At this Effie folded her treasure under her little apron, and sprang up on the landing. This made the boy angry, and his screams were no dove notes. The mother, unaware, we will charitably hope of the injustice of the act) struck Effie a heavy   Richard Armstrong.     1" blow, which, standing as she was near the edge of the topmost step, caused her to lose her balance and fall to the bottom of the staircase, striking her head upon the baluster. She was taken up\ insensible; but as there was little outward injury apparent, the doctor did not at first fear any se- rious result. But the child never walked agaiq. She lingered for some weeks, at times consciou recognizing her father who never left her even for an hour, save under Martha's care. She sufered great agony at times, in her head, and it was sad to hear her cry,- "Please do n't tear the book, Dickie, dear." It made Aunt Martha's heart ache to see the despairing terror of the father as he watched the fading away of this beautiful flower. She died in 'his arms after one moment of consciousness, in which shekissed him and said,-"Please, Papa, take me in your arms; do n't let me die and go away from you." These were her last words; and when he found  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7484-00000059"/> "2        AMy Hero. how helpless was his strong arm to save her, and saw the eyes he loved to look into close forever, he seemed like one stricken by a thunder - bolt. Not a word escaped him; he laid the lifeless little form in Aunt Martha's arms, and went with a tottering step to his own room. It was noticed that not one word of reproach to his wife escaped his lips; he never accused her of any wrong towards the child; but from the hour of Effie's death he seemed to relinquish all hope of any change in her, and a sort of sullen despair filled his heart, and was evident in all his actions. He treated her with all outward respect, and few out of thd household,-no one perhaps, not even the doctor,-knew what caused Effie's death, save that she fell. The wife seemed stricken with grief at the loss of her child, and mourned for many days.  Aunt Martha prayed and  hoped that it might lead her to a better life, but she found, at last, such consolation in her grief as made Aunt Martha say,-   Richard Armstrong.     113 "I shall never despair of God's grace; but he did once say of a sinner, 'He is joined to his idols, let him alone.' Of one thing I am sure; I shall let Mrs. Richard alone, and go back to Little Star Island." Little Dick was a delicate child, needing such care and discipline as he could not receive at home; but the mother kept him with her, resisting all her husband's efforts for the good of the boy. Sometimes for hours he would lie curled up at the foot of her bed, while she lay in a stupid sleep. His father sought him one day to take him riding with him, and for this purpose went up to his wife's room, a place which he had not often visit- ed since Effie's death. Dickie was on the floor, his usually pale cheeks flushed, and his sleep heavy.  Richard Armstrong raised him in his arms, when, to his disgust and horror, he found the child's breath strong with that liquid poison which destroys soul and body. His eye fell on a little cabinet which his wife claimed as her prop-  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7484-00000060"/> E1i        JIlMy Hero. erty, and that was usually kept locked but now was ajar. He flung open the door, and taking out a spirit case full of bottles and little canned glasses, he flung it from the window, with all the strength of his brawny arm, where it fell upon the ?round broken in a hundred pieces. Then he 5ore his child from the room, not stopping till he iad traversed the garden path and placed the boy n his boat, which he loosed from its mooring, rnd, taking the oars, rowed with strong, rapid trokes till he found himself in Martha's house. lartha, who had known him from his birth, and as used to his somewhat stern manner, was tartled when she saw the gloom on his brow and larked the firm, compressed lips. "Martha," said he, "save my child for me; a must never see his mother again." The boy was asleep, and would not be easily akened. Martha laid him in her bed, then rned to the father who sat moolily by. "Mr. Richard, I am glad you have come-to   Izichard Armstrong.     115 this decision. God helping me, I will save your boy. God has sent sorrow upon you; I wish you could learn that He chastises in love." Richard Armstrong made no answer, but rose to go; he walked as far as the little gate, then turned and came back. "I can trust you, Martha; the child must not see his mother." "Never," said Martha, "till she becomes a fit mother for the child." Then he went back to his own house, strong to bear his fate, strong in his despair, but with no hope, only that he might save his child. He foresaw the storm that would burst upon him, but he cared not for it. There were bitter taunts, angry reproaches mingled with entreaties for her child. She did love the child; it seemed to be the one womanly feeling that was left to her; and when she promised on her bended knees that she would live a different life if her child could be re- turned to her, her husband's heart softened for a  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7484-00000061"/> "6       My Hero. moment. There were still some remains of her former beauty ; and when she pleaded with him, saying, -- Give me my child or I shall die; know, Richard Armstrong, when you see me dead, it will be your hand that has murdered me ;" he hesitated for one instant at the thought of what she might do in her anger or her grief. His res- olution wavered. It was well perhaps for the boy that he was sitting opposite Effie's picture, and that his eyes rested upon it. The sight of it filled him with exceeding bitterness, and he rose, all the sternness of his manner returning as he said,-  "Madam, it can not be. You are unworthy of the child; on one condition only can he be re- turned to you, -an entire reformation of life and habits." He stood like a rock, and his wife knew that there was no appeal from his sentence. We will not paint the scene that followed, - the overmas- tering passion which, like a wild sea, burst its   Richard Armstrong.     117 bounds, wave after wave tossing its angry foam, till nature herself wearied of the storm it had raised and was silent. She was exhausted to helplessness when he raised her and laid her down to rest. Then she began her revenge, torturing him at times, when she called for her boy, with fearffil screams that rent the air, and then again with days of stupid sleep. But perhaps the most irri- tating of all was her taunting him with his un- belief, - she who, reared in a religious faith, had dishonored it in her life, now flung all the terrors of the Bible at him. It was, let us charitably hope partial insanity, and as s)t he received it; but it, effect was only to plunge him deeper into those studies which led him further from that grea source of consolation, a living, loving Father i: heaven who knoweth our weakness and listenet to our prayer. He whose heart was broken wit disappointment, lived only in a bare, desolai where no day relieved the night.  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7484-00000062"/> CHAPTER IV. SHADOW AND TRAGEDY. O, AUNTIE Dole, I can't let you have them any cheaper. You see it is hard work for a fellow to foot it away down to the port this warm day after fish; you must give me my price.

"Never mind the rags, Auntie Dole, if the pockets will hold the money," he said, as he put his hand in'his pocket and rattled the coppers with which it was filled. "Say, Auntie, can you sell a lot of Plumb Island plums if I'll pick 'em for you?" "Yes, I suppose so; there's Mrs, Stone wants 'em for presarvin', and Miss Esther, the house - keeper at Oakwood, has spoken for a peck or so." "What will you give me if I'll bring you a bushel, Auntie?" "About a dollar,'I reckon." "Say a quarter more, and the bargain is closed," Dick answered. ' There you are again, you little miser. . I do n't know what you are coming to.

Its time you had learned your manners." Auntie Dole kept a little shop where she sup- plied the neighbors with many articles of daily need, thereby saving a ride to town. She was a queer-looking little body, her usual dress being a stuff petticoat and short gown, very high - heeled shoes on her feet, a high plaid turban on her head, and a string of gold beads around her neck. She possessed the knowledge, wonderful to all he children, of making gingerbread toys in a great variety of forms. There were prancing horses vith mighty men upon them, dogs with wonder- ully thick tails, birds for which no name could be ound, save  "Auntie  Dole's roosters," and,- tranger still to relate, there were horns, with ttle figures over them, real horns too, that you ould fill with sugar  -they were so large  iat they would hold two cents' 'worth of bi? igar plums, or two red and white gibralters. he secret of making these gingerbread horns, (as   Shnacow and tr'ageay.     " they were called, Auntie Dole never reveals to her best friend; and it was said she made them at night, so that no one should find out. Added to these were "hearts," and "rounds," and "diamonds," and currant buns with sweet, shiny tops to tempt little urchins. Then there was always a supply of pickled limes for the school - girls who generally kept the old lady busy about school-:time, and added considerably to her sup- ply of coppers. For the older people Auntie Dole made " emptins," as the yeast of that day was called, and kept stocking yarn, needles, thread, tapes, &amp;c., and a little fine cut tobacco for the clay pipes which' were always on hand. Eggs, berries, distilled mint and rose water she ordered for customers from certain women who lived in a little settlement across the river. Then all Auntie Dole's leisure was given to knitting socks and mittens; every school - boy knew where to go for a good, stout pair of the latter article. Besides all these things, she took a Boston  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7484-00000064"/> Iury X-ero. weekly paper, which was an attraction to some of her neighbors and caused her little shop to be quite a resort of a winter's evening, while her "spruce beer" and "diet drink" made it equally so in summer. There was a real spirit of trade and enterprise in the little woman, and the neighbors said that she was growing rich. It was certain that she had a nice little sum  in the Savings Bank in town; but as no income taxes disturbed moneyed people in those days, Auntie Dole never spoke of her gains, and the wise men who managed the Bank were very reticent persons. Auntie Dole recognized a somewhat kindred spirit in Dick Barnard, but the strict honesty which governed her dealings was lacking in the boy.  When Dick went home that night, he found his hard-working mother in the garden taking the clothes from the line, preparatory to ironing the next morning    "Why, Dick Barnard, where have you been;?"  she exclaimed somewhat sharply, for she was weary and heavy -hearted. Making money, Mother. Hear it rattle!" And he shook the pockets. "Got any supper for a hungry fellow?" "Yes; you will find it on the table; but take hold of this basket for me, only do n't come too near the clean clothes." "Tired, mother?" "Clean beat out, child, with hard work." "Well, look here, Mother. I'll tell you, I am going to be a rich mnan, and make a lady of you. The time will come when you shall have a satin gown and ride in a coach." "I wish I could ride in a one horse wagon now," said the poor woman, as she began to fold the clothes while her boy ate his supper. "It is a - coming, Mother, sure as fate I  shall set up a peddler's cart next summer, and then we 'll see I Would n't you like a gown that shines and waves like what Mrs. Armstrong wore  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7484-00000065"/> 124        My Hero. to meeting one day, long ago, when I was a lit- tle shaver? And would n't you like a coach and two horses like Mr. Richard Armstrong's high- stepping-grays?" "What is the use of talking, Dick?" said the mother, as she run her hands through stockings whose numerous rents made her sigh. "A good deal more use, Mother, than to tell fairy stories like Ruth Johns, though it is mighty nice to listen to her. She's the prettiest girl in the school, Mother. Is it true that she has lots of money?" "Yes; they say her father rolls in gold." "Why do n't she wear velvet gowns then, and gold rings?" "Jacob Stirling and his wife never wear such things, and she is under their control now." "I do n't like Friends' notions, Mother. If I had a sister, I would dress her like - like" - but Dick was at a loss for comparisons, but added, after a little hesitation, "like the queen' of   Shadow and Tragedy.      125 Sheba," that expression having occurred in his last Sunday -school lesson. "You must go to pasture now, Dick," said his mother, " and you can dream about queens and coaches when you go to bed." While he is busy milking the cow, Jacob and Ruth are in Grandmother Stirling's room, where they usually passed the hour before going to bed. Each child has a Bible in hand, and reads alternately three verses at a time aloud. They were reading the sixth chapter of Luke. "We begin at the thirty-first verse, Grandma," said Ruth, and she read in a clear, sweet voice- "'And as ye would that men should do to you,- do ye also to them likewise., "'For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.'" Ruth read with reverence and with more feel- ing, perhaps, than most girls of her age; but when Jacob began, there was a slowness and  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7484-00000066"/> 126        My Hero. abstraction in his manner, as if every word was weighed, and bore to his heart its full meaning. "'But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for notlhing again; and your reward shall bIe great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest; for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. "'Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.'" These six verses completed the evening lesson, and Grandma Stirling never wearied them with words of her own when the Bible was in their hands. She now simply said, - "See the key to the Saviour's life. Turn to Matt, 20: 28." Jacob found and read, -" 'Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to min- ister, and to give his life a ransom for many.'" Jacob read it as he had the other verses, very slowly, and then re - read it to himself. "Grandma," he said at length, did n't Jesus   "Shadow and Tragedy.     127 Christ spend all his life in doing good to others?" "Yes, child, thee has read his life enough to know that." '"But it is said that He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; now I am happiest when I have done something to make others happy, and, you know, He had power to heal diseases, making the blind to see and the lame to walk; I think I should be happy if I had that power." Ah! my child, Jesus Christ was happy, so happy in His great love and His great power that thee and I can not conceive of His joy; but then thee must remember that He bore the sins of many, that, pure and good himself, He sounded the depths'of human sin and suffering in thai wicked city, till His great soul was overwhelme( at times with-the sin and sorrow of the people a if they were his own.

I can hardly explain it, Jacob, but I think thee can understand what I mean when I add, that I should be happier at thy bedside if thee were ill, than I should be in any party of pleasure. Jesus Christ found His happiness in relieving the sorrow of a world where pain and trouble are the common lot; perhaps His followers would inherit His peace if they would imitate Him more closely. But I did not mean to preach a sermon; the spirit moved me to speak these words; but little Ruth's eyes look sleepy, and I will wish thee both good- night." They sought their own beds, - Ruth to un- dress quickly, throw her clothes upon a chair, kneel by the bedside, and repeat her evening prayer sleepily; and then, with a toss of her curls back from her forehead, she lay down, and with scarcely more than one droop of her eyelids, lost herself in sleep. c   Shadow and Tragedy.      129 Not so with Jacob. He turned again to his Bible, and read over the words, - He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many." When he closed the book, the large, dark eyes seemed full of thought, of a sort of questioning wonder, as if for the first time the real purpose and' the beauty of Christ's life had been revealed to him. His mind seemed far away, though the force of habit led him to shake each garment a little as he took it off, and then fold and lay it in a chair at the head of his bed; the shoes were placed to. gether, with a rolled stocking in each. He ha( never known any other way; he was born, as ] said, into orderly habits; they were inherited As he lay down in his bed he said to himself, - "Well, if I am a Christian, there is work for m, to do in this world.

I wish I was a rich man, and could build a great hospital, and let the poor people, who are sick and can't pay for a doctor, come there to be healed. That would be grand! I will talk with Grandma. about it. I would get them all into a beautiful house, and have nice, clean beds, and doctors and nurses, and good broths, such as Mother makes when I am sick, and lemons anad oranges, and I will have a garden with flowers, and"-but the little fellow was tired and fell asleep, only to dream a very beautiful dream of a great place, all sunshine and flowers, where all the old people looked like Grandpa and Grandma in the garb of Friends, spotless and clean, and of little girls all with rosy cheeks and bright eyes like Ruth, and of a great strong man like Mr. Armstrong who carried some little children in his arms, as he walked beside a broad river bordered by trees and flowers.        ) He was very happy there, for nobody was   Shadow and Tragedy.     13: sick, and nobody was poor; all were enjoyin, themselves, and not a tear was seen or a sig heard. But suddenly, as he was sitting under tree enjoying the sight of so much happinesc Dick Barnard appeared, in a slouched hat, ragge clothes covered with mud, and no shoes on h feet, saying, "Halloo, Jake, come along and get son pond-lilies. I needn'tt have told you, on Ruth likes 'em so well." This awoke Jacob, and, sure enough, the I part of the dream was true, for there stood Di Barnard at the foot of the bed, and the brc daylight was streaming in at the window. I Dick was not ragged or dirty, for his p mother had sat up late at night to mend  clean his clothes. "Come on, Jake," he said. "I met Mr. A strong down by the river- side, and he says and I may have his skiff and get all the lilies want, and he has taken Bruno off with him i t  , L;  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7484-00000069"/> x1oz       My Hero. that he will not be there to bite., Be jabers, Jake, if you hain't got a buster of aroom,'-a white spread on your bed, and white curtains to your window, and a bit of carpet to step on, and, hurra! Jake, is them clothes yourn, folded up like my marm's Sunday gown? Well, if I should keep my fixins like that, I should n't have any time to make money. Hurry up, for I want to be on hand to sell my lilies on the first train, and I have got a mile to walk after the lilies are picked." Jacob never hurried, but he dressed about as quickly as Dick would have got into his clothes, thrown helter-skelter as they generally were around his bare attic room. Not that Dick was destitute of all taste for nice or fine things; he was fond of bright colors and gay clothes, and when he indulged himself in a neck - tie, he chose one that would attract attention across the meet- ing - house. He had no liking for the quiet color and plain ways of the Friends. )  / L i    Shadow and Tragedy.      133 He made a couple of dollars by his lilies that day, to add to his hoard in his strong box, while Ruth's room was fragrant with their perfume and lovely with their gold and white blossoms. The soft, hazy days of August fled away with rapid feet, and September came all too soon for the children, who were to turn away from beaches and woods to the red school-house on the hill. No one was more loth to go to school than Dick Barnard, for he looked upon the time spent there as so much money lost. "If it was n't for the Arithmetic, be jabers, I would n't stay a day," he often said; so, with his usual energy, he worked hard at that till he was ahead of all the boys, and, when spring came, had worked every sum even in "Rotation of Pay- ments," and all the "Miscellaneous Questions." His education was now considered complete, and he prepared to make his entrance on a life in a peddler's cart. He had fifty dollars of his own, and he borrowed fifty of his father, and the use  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7484-00000070"/> 134        My Hero. of a horse. The cart was a cheap concern, and not amply stocked, but Dick paid five dollars to the village painter for putting on a coat of red paint, and an inscription in large yellow letters,-- "Dry Goods," on one side, and "Tobacco and Pipes" on the other, with his own name, "D. Barnard," beneath. When he started on his first trip, he drove down to Auntie Dole's shop, and drew up his horse with quite a professional air, as if he had been long used to the business. - He wore a new cap of fanciful shape, a red and white neck-tie, a plaid vest and checkered trowsers. Auntie Dole looked through her great horn spectacles a full minute before she could make out what gay young gentleman had honored her with a call, and even said, "Good morning, Sir," with as much respect as she would have addressed Mr. Armstrong, when Dick took off his cap and made her a bow.       ) "Lawful sakes alive! Dick Barnard, is that   Shadow and Tragedy.      135 you? What's in the wind now, that you are dressed in that style?"   .  . "I am starting on my travels, Auntie, and I expect to trade with the ladies, and I am dressed to please 'em,-all in the way of trade, you know. Can I serve you with anything to - day?" "Go along, Dick Barnard; do you think old Grannie Dole, that bought goods forty year afore you was born, wants you to pick and choose for her?" "Well, Auntie, perhaps you can sell me some goods,"' said Dick, not at all disturbed by the old woman's rough manner. "That's another thing, boy; what do you want?" "I have a notion that I could sell some of your gingerbread gim - cracks there,-horses, and wild animals, and the cattle show generally. Besides, before we bargain, I tell you I want 'em at wholesale price, and on tick for two weeks." "No, no, Dick; I am too sharp for you if  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7484-00000071"/> 136       MYy Hero. you are clever. If I trust you, you must pay full price for 'em, and pay me in four weeks." "I haven't time to spend in talking. Put me up all you have on hand, and I will see what I can do with them." There were only two dollars' worth in the shop. Auntie Dole packed them with careful hands, and then stood in the shop-door, looking like a curious old picture in a frame; her high turban and high - heeled shoes forming base and capital for her short, plump little body. As she stood looking at Dick, a sudden thought struck her, and she turned back to ler shop, drew from under the counter an old shoe and threw it after him.  Dick understood the superstition, and, rising, made a flourish with his whip, a bow to the old woman, and then drove on, full of hope that he should one day be a rich man. The school children were on the green at recess when he drove by.  They all gavd a shout. He stopped to bid them good y Ruth Johns tood stopped to bid them good bye. Ruth Johns stood   Shadow and 'Tragedy.      1 a few steps from the cart, her bright blue y brimful of fun as she read the inscriptionn n  and marked the gaudy coloring.  / "Dry Goods!

Quick as a flash, Dick turned to his cart al produced a little handkerchief of delicate E grass, which he had found at some store at t Port, where it had lain for a long time, broug from Calcutta by some sailor, and sold for trifle. "Take it, Ruth," he said, " and pay i when I go to England in my steamship to E you." "Hurra! Hurra! Hurra!" shouted the bo, while Dick, to whom time was precious, drc off, the boys continuing to shout till the mast bell hushed the sound. Life had little excitement and few changes this village.

They were always in their place at the plain, drb - colored Friends' meeting house, and were as serenely happy as mortals could ex- pect to be in a world where frosts are sometimes untimely, and heat and rain not always in the proportion which a good farmer could desire. There was really no skeleton in this family. But before a year had passed, a letter came from Ruth's father in London, which called for a fam- ily council, and was likely to cause some heart- ache. Robert Johns longed for his daughter, little Ruth. He knew she was happy in his old home. He recalled his own childhood there, -the sweet influence of his mother, Lucy Stirling, and the tender guardianship of Jacob Stirling, senior. He owed much of his happiness in life to the lessons there given him,- to govern himself, and to learn the patience which makes daily life a blessing, lifting it above the fret and chafe of   Shadow and  'ragedy.     IOU petty cares. He knew Susan, too, and how lov- ingly she had taken his motherless child to her heart. Still, it was hard to be separated from his only child, the broad ocean between them. Day after day and week after week his heart yearned for his child, and at last, one day when a letter came from her, beautifully written and full of love (he would have smiled if he had known how many clean sheets of paper little Jacob found for her after seeing the blots she made, and how patiently he corrected all mis- takes), he sat down and wrote to Mr. Stirling, that, if they would allow the children to come to England, he would educate Jacob, carrying him through an English University, and afterwards send him with a tutor to see the continent. He wanted his own child and he was selfish enough, he said, to want some of the Stirlings also. He would come for the children if they consented to this arrangement. Orandpa Stirling shook his head as he looked at  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7484-00000073"/> "O        My Bero. his grandson. "If I thought thee would grow out of the simplicity of thy home training, and become reckless like many college boys, thee had better remain on the farm." Jacob made no an- swer, save by a look of sadness and half reproach, as if Grandfather could harbor such a thought; but his mother, who perceived that look in his eyes, said,-"Jacob will never dishonor his parents. Thee can trust him, Grandfather, with all thy heart." And thus it came to pass that the children were sent to London for four years, and the Stirling farm was made desolate for a while, until, wearied with the silence of a childless house, Jacob Stirling brought home an orphan boy to rear, and then his wife said,- "We must find ,another, Jacob; if thee will take me to the orphan asylum in the city, I will find a little girl to help fill the void which dear Ruth has made."  Thus two little desolate hearts were made glad in that happy home.            .   Shadow and Tragedy.      141 The shadows increased if Oakwood; the shadows of the grand old elms were more dense, the evergreen walk flung back the sunlight from its ever- thickening boughs, the dark paint and gray stone grew darker with age, and a deeper shadow than all these cast, fell on the home with- in. The mistress of the mansion was always either in a state of depression and silent gloom, when every sense was chained, or in a merry, ex- cited mood more painful to witness. The loss of her child increased her aversion to her husband, and led her to make threats of des- perate revenge. It was more painful to the father to hear the little boy plead to be carried to Mamma. He missed the excitement of her little glasses of cordial, her constant petting and impru- dent indulgence. He fell sick, and when he begged his father, with such a longing look in his eyes, to take him to Mamma, the father's heart could not resist, and he said to Aunt Martha,-"Wrap him carefully, Martha; I can  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7484-00000074"/> "2       My Hero. not deny him. I will bear him gently in my arms. Come with me; Jim is a careful oarsman. I can not hear these moans and be at peace." Mr. Richard," said the firm, stern old woman, "it is you who, in a moment of weakness, will murder your child. The boy will live. Be patient, and let the Lord do his work." Then she laid the child back into its bed; night and day she watched beside it, recalling for his sake all the child - lore of her younger days, and devoting her- self wholly to the dear one. He often looked over the water for the "pretty lady with the golden hair," and one day she came. He was asleepwhen she entered, and she sat by his side, the flowers and toys which she had brought him spread upon the bed. When he opened his eyes and saw her, he held up his hands for her' to take him, laughing as he had not laughed for many a day. She stayed some hours, and being one of those persons who know the way right to a child's heart, she did him more good than the dbctor's   Shadow and Tragedy.      143 medicine, or even Aunt Martha's nursing, good as it might be. They were both soon upon the floor together, little Dickie playing with the golden hair which she let down for his amuse- ment, while he covered his face with it and played bo- peep through its silky meshes; then she sang such sweet little songs as Aunt Martha had never heard, and told such funny things as the nursery rhyme,- "Two little kittens had lost their mittens," and a new edition of little Riding Hood, where a brave man comes in and kills the wolf, and re- stores the grandmother and the little girl to life. Dickie thought this delightful, and was altogether in such a state of enjoyment that Aunt Martha was forced to go out of the room, just to shed a few tears and thank God for sending her such aid. When Dickie was tired, Miss Mary took him in her arms and sang so sweetly that he fell asleep again, and then, while he slept, a boat- man came and carried her away; but when Aunt  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7484-00000075"/> "4        My Hero. Martha,. with tears in her eyes, begged her to come soon again, she promised to do so. It hap- pened that Mr. Armstrong came while Dickie slept, and, in telling his father about the pretty lady with golden hair, he forgot his disappoint- ment at not finding her there. After that, he never cried to go away, because, as .he said,- "The pretty lady comes to Star Island, and Dickie must not be away when she comes." A year passed;  the child was gaining health and learning to forget those passionate outhreaks which made him a terror to the house- hold; but the poor mother,- neither the promise of the child restored, nor the sense of self respect, nor the knowledge of her degradation, of which she was at times conscious, could break the power of evil habits. Her temper became more violent, her utter disregard of husband and friends in- creased; but the loss of the child goaded her at times to fearful imprecations,. which Richard Armstrong bore with -a stoicism that never re-   Shadow and Tragedy.  torted, but it was a stony patience which had nothing in its nature akin to the sweet Christian forbearance which our Saviour teaches us to feel towards the erring. It was the second summer after the boy had been removed from her, that she sat, one day, at the window of her room which looked out into the garden, and watched her husband gather- ing a large bouquet of choice flowers, and noticed also that he did not bring them into the house. It was not far from sunset. Wrapping herself in a shawl, she stole down the' garden steps, and, going into the evergreen walk, observed him hastening out of it at the other side. Following with light step, she saw him take the path to the willow tree, and, after depositing his flowers in the boat, row himself away down the river. "I will see where those flowers go," she said to herself; "perhaps to my child." In the early days of their married life she had learned to row a boat; strong and healthy, the exercise was  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7484-00000076"/> "6        My Hero. easy and agreeable, so that, through the long summer, she spent some hours daily on the river in a gay little boat which her husband had named "Water Lily." It was long since she cared for this sport, and her husband, wearied by her re- peated refusal to accompany him, never asked her now. But the boat was in the boat - house, and had been occasionally used during the sum- mer. - She retraced her steps to the garden, or- dered a boy who was at work there to get her boat ready, and tying a little scarf around her head, took the oars and put off, much to the as- tonishment of the lad who had stood waiting orders to accompany her. He looked seaward, then to the eastern horizon, and ventured to say,--- I 'm afeared there will be a storm, ma'am." ' Let it come!" she said, as, with a vigorous stroke of the oars, she pushed the boat into the deeper water.  The boy stood on the bank watching the boat till it was only a tiny speck in the distance, and then returned to his work, much (   , '\   Shadow and Tragedy.      147 wondering at Madame's adventure. The wind and tide favored her, and after rounding the first bend in the river, she caught sight of a boat which she thought contained her husband, and which she determined to keep in sight. The sun had now set, but the twilight enabled her to keep him in view for some minutes longer; and, as she believed, take the direction towards Star Island. Then it occurred to her that her child might be there, though she had supposed him at a great distance. Suspicion and anger gave strength to her arms for a few minutes longer, - long enough for her to see him turn the point of the island. Then suddenly her strength failed, and a stupid, sleepy feeling oppressed her; but she was not wholly overcome by it, for, seeing a light in the window of Aunt Martha's house, she made an effort to land. In her anxiety to over- take her husband, she had not noticed the sky which had darkened suddenly, nor the wind which now began to blow, roughening the water and  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7484-00000077"/> "8        My Hero. curling the waves as they rolled in shore. She managed to push her boat upon the sands at the point of the island, but could find no means of fastening it, the increasing darkness hiding the rock to which her husband's boat was moored. She stepped from the skiff, and dragged it a little way up the bank, when there came a furious blast of wind that threw her backward upon the sand, and brought a wave that swept her boat away, tossing it like a toy on the angry billows. The storm increased, the wind blowing dead upon the shore, and the flying clouds seemed like frightened children running hither and thither in strange confusion. It was the first installment of the September gale. The poor woman lay as if stunned for 'a mo- ment, and then rose and walked, 'or rather was driven by the wind, towards the house. The curtain was not drawn, and as she hooked in, she saw her little boy, bright and happy in his father's arms. He held the flowers in his hands,   Shadow and Tragedy.      14 and now and then kissed his father's cheek, talk- 'ing the meanwhile very earnestly, as if telling some story, as indeed he was, about the pretty lady who had sent him her picture and a box of toys. Aunt Martha was knitting, her eyes not upon her work but upon father and son, her comely features expressing full sympathy with their happiness. The poor woman stood there in the wind and the rain which had now begun to fall, like a lost spirit looking at angels in Paradise. Not long, however, did she stand thus, for the strong potion, taken just before leaving home, now lost its exhilarating effects, and a stupor seized her senses. She fell prostrate on the ground, hidden partly from sight by' the shrub- bery which Aunt Martha had trained about her home. The storm increased; great gusts of rain swept against the house, bringing with them the salt spray of the sea. Louder grew the sound of the ocean in its anger, as the waves beat against  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7484-00000078"/> 150        My Hero. the land and swept back again with a hoarse roar. The darkness was intense, and as the night wore on, the house rocked and the tumult of the sea was fearful. Richard Armstrong had fore- seen this storm, and, knowing how much more terrible such tempests seemed on the island than at Oakwood, had come thither for the sake of his child. When the boy had fallen asleep, he went out to see if his boat was secure. He made his way with difficulty, for the flakes of foam, the sand and sea - weed were driving in his face, and though he carried a lantern, it threw little light in the great darkness. Finding his boat safe, he was returning to the house, when, holding the lantern high that it might throw its light farther, he saw what seemed at first the foam of a breaker, tossed to land, almost touching the house. As he came nearer, the light fell directly upon the white mass which he now thought might be some wrapper or cloak   Shadow and Tragedy.       15 of the child which had fallen out of the window. He stooped to take it up, when the light fell di- rectly on the face of his wife! Her long hair, dripping with spray and rain, had fallen over her shoulders, the light - hued cashmere shawl, which had attracted his attention, lay in a draggled heap, partly upon the ground, affording little protec- tion to the owner. She was asleep, but with little of the placidness of rest, for her features, once so beautiful, were swollen, and Richard Armstrong lifted her in his arms and bore her tenderly into the house; but he kept his eyes resolutely away from her face after the first glance. "Mr. Richard, how in all the world came she here?"  "We will not stop to wonder, Aunt Martha; get some warm clothing and make her comfort- able; she sleeps." "Yes, and very soundly, too," said the old woman, dryly; nevertheless she was expert in getting the sleeper into dry clothes and a warm   &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7484-00000079"/> 152       My Hero. bed, after which she sat down to give vent to her wonder and her fears. Mr. Armstrong conjec- tured the truth, that he had been watched and followed. "She must not see the child!" ex- claimed Aunt Martha. "Not so, Martha,' said Mr. Richard; it may be that the sight of the boy, so well and bright, may help to win her back. I can hardly believe a mother so lost to all sense of right as not to wish to bempure and good for the sake of such a child," glancing at the sleeping boy. "Aye I Aye!

"But there is hope while there is life; try the ex- periment if you please, but in my opinion nothing but God's grace will ever redeem your wife.

The storm continued all night, and had not abated its fury when daylight came. It was a grand sight for one who stood on that rocky island, to watch the ocean in its wrath, beating against the huge rocks, tossing its spray far in- land, and roaring as if an immense forest were filled with wild beasts roaring for their prey. Aunt Martha's house was far above high -water mark, but the spray and the sea-weed were tossed against its weather - beaten walls, and once or twice the huge waves broke only a few feet -from the door. Mrs. Armstrong did not wake from her heavy sleep till late in the day. She was alone, and for a few minutes could not recall her wandering senses, when suddenly the laugh of a child in the next room reminded her of her sail down the river the evening before. It was her &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7484-00000080"/> 154       My Hero. own child's voice that she heard. "Now sing it again, Aunt Martha, and then I'll catch the tune." The old woman sang in rather a cracked voice,- There is a little mermaid Who lives down in the sea." Then the boy took up the song, and, catching the tune correctly, made very sweet music. Mrs. Armstrong was dressed in a long, loose white robe which Aunt Martha had managed to put on her the night before, and her hair hung disheveled over her shoulders, as in her impatience she rushed into the room to her child. He was frightened at sight of her, and ran screaming to Aunt Martha while he clung to her gown. "Dick, my darling, do n't you know  your mother?" she cried, first in sad, piteous tones, and then, as he still refused to come near- her, said, angrily,-"Dick, I am your mother; they stole you from me, that wicked woman and your father."   Skcadow and Tragedy.     . 15 "Aunt Martha is not wicked; she is food, and I love her." At this the woman. sprang forward, and would have torn her child away, had not Aunt Martha said, gently,-"Come, Mrs. Armstrong, if you will get dressed, little Dick may know you better. Come, your clothes are dry in the next room; I will help you." The old woman's manner disarmed the angry mother, and she followed, the child being in Aunt Martha's arms, into the-next room. She dressed herself, took her breakfast, and gradually the little boy was won to go and sit in her lap. She almost devoured him with  her kisses, pressed him to her bosom, while all the passion- ate love returned in full force. She tried, for his sake, to recall the songs of former years. Alas! the voice had lost its sweet- ness, and the memory faltered. Richard Arm- strong had gone out after eating his breakfast, and did not return for some hours, but the storm &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7484-00000081"/> 156        My Hero.  rendered it hazardous to leave the island. When he returned, his boy was asleep in his mother's arms. For an instant his face was lighted by a smile, as Aunt Martha afterwards said, such as she had not seen on his features since his boy- hood; but the only response was a bitter, cruel taunt from the lips that had long been a stranger to kind words. He made no reply, but went out again. A small fishing smack had been wrecked in the storm, one body thrown upon the shore, and he was assisting the few fishermen upon the island to give the poor waif a decent burial. Towards noon the storm abated, and before evening the sun came out, and smiled upon the angry sea as if it would charm away its wrath. But it still moaned heavily and would not rest. Itwas about four o'clock in the afternoon. Dick had played for hours by his mother's side, and had fallen asleep on the carpet in the midst of his playthings. Aunt Martha was. busy in her kitchen, coming in every few minutes. When   Shadow and Tragedy.     157 she saw the child asleep, she said to Betsey, her little maid of all work,-"I am going to the poor sailor's funeral. I shall be goroe but a short time, you must not leave the house, and be sure to stay near the baby," as she still called Dickie.  It isa lone place, the burial ground on Star Island, a spot so rocky that it is almost impossi- ble to dig a grave between the stones, and large boulders are used as headstones, while stone walls protect the little enclosure. There were few events of much interest in this little island, and Betsey thought it was hard to be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the sailor's funeral; so, after one look at Mrs. Armstrong and the chiM, she ran aroundthelane to look at the funeral pro- session which wound its way up a small hill where the dead were laid, safe from the water which sometimes sweeps over a large part of the island. Mrs. Armstrong saw the girl depart, knew that she was alone in the house, and resolved to improve her opportunity. She wrapped the- ty  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7484-00000082"/> 158        My Hero. in a large shawl, and bore him in her arms, out of the house, downwards and towards the sands. One who has never visited those little rocky islands off the coast of Massachusetts, can have little idea of the rugged, picturesque scene they present. On  one side of this island, great rocks rise out of the water to the hight of fifty feet or more, their tops and sides scarred and worn by storms and tides; back of these, huge boulders lie, as if thrown there by a great convulsion of the earth beneath, or tossed by some tempest in the might of its anger. Between these great masses of rock, scooped and hollowed out by the waves that never rest from toil, are little pools of clear water, in whose transparent depths is a miniature world, decked with the richest emerald green mosses and fern - like plants that wave like forest trees, under which tiny fishes play and little shell- fish dwell in safety. So transparent is the water, that they reflect the shadows of the gray rocks around them, and mirror the passing clouds above.   Shadow and Tragedy.      151 It needs a quick eye and wary footstep to trav- erse these rocky ledges at low tide; one false step on the giddy hight of some of the overhanging rocks, and then a plunge into those deep cold wa- ters where no human arm can save. The surf dashes against this rocky barrier, and flings its spray high up into the faces of those who stand on its dizzy hight. There is many a secure hiding -place among these rocks, and many a spot where one might be hidden away from all the world, with the ever- sounding music of the sea for his lullaby. But let him beware how he lingers when the tide is rising, for it cometh up, not like the swellings of Jordan from which the lion rushes to the habita- tions of men, but with a slow, steady, stealthy' step, like the tiger that watches for its prey. It was amid these rocks that Mrs. Armstrong came with her child,--here to hide with him till some boat might be found in which she could row him to Oakwood, for many boats were, in fine  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7484-00000083"/> 160       My Hero. weather, moored to little coves amnid these rocks. Dickie was delighted with the rocks and the hiding-places which they formed, and with the fish playing in the pools, and looked here and there for his little mermaid down in the sea. Once or twice he was sure he saw her gown of silk floating in the water, and then her golden hair; but one was the soft green sea - weed, and the other the bright yellow moss on the rocks, shining like gold in the sunlight. Here and there, up and down he ran, his mother keeping close beside him till his little feet wearied at last, and she wrapped him again in the shawl, and prom- ised to sing if he would sit down by her on one of the broad rocks. The tide was coming in, but the higher rocks just in front of her prevented her from seeing how rapidly it gained upon the shore, nor did she realize what power the night's storm still gave the water, even under a serene sky. Higher and still higher if came, each in- coming wave creeping  stealthily onward, and   Shadow and Tragedy.     1 writing its name above the last. Then came one almost on a line with mother and child, but still she sang,-- ( The canvass rattled on the mast As rose the swelling sail; And gallantly the vessel passed Before the cheering gale;  and the child laughed. But, thoughtless of their own safety, there was one who did not forget them. When Mr. Armstrong returned from the funeral and found his wife and child gone, he rushed at once down to the rocks. Gaining a high point, he saw the tide coming in rapidly, and at the same instant discovered a woman and child, evi- dently ignorant of the danger which menaced them -the next instant. He was at a distance -from them, and it required no small caution to traverse the jagged rocks and leap the pools which inter- vened. Meanwhile, his practiced eye saw that they were already surrounded by water,- the rock in front having deceived them as to the   &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7484-00000084"/> 162 '      My Hero. hight of the tide. He dared not cry out to them to go backward, lest he should alarm them, and increase the danger of their falling into the deep pool already full in their rear. He possessed firm nerves and a sailor's step and eye, but, in spite of his agility, the merciless sea, eager for its prey, came on with a terrible sweep of waters and rushed over the rock in front of mother and child; and, just as Richard Armstrong was almost near enough to grasp them in his arms, they were hidden from his sight. Fear almost paralyzed him for an in- stant; he waited for the returning wave, and then saw a sight which curdled the blood in his veins,- a terrified woman, clinging with both hands to a jagged rock, and, - the child swept towards the sea I Two steps forward and he might save the bhild; one grasp of the hand and he could save the mother; but the time, the one moment con- sumed in bearing hler back would lose him the child forever; for Richard ArInstrong believed then that death was an eternal sleep, that the light   Shadow and Tragedy.      16I of his eyes, the joy of his life, was gone-for- ever. It is a fearful word, but only a feeble repre- sentation of the thought in this man's mind. We live years in an instant at some time in our lives. God had given this man a strong, brave nature. With compressed lip but strong arms, he lifted this woman as if she were but a feather's weight, and bore her back to a place of safety, but no spoken word escaped him.  Then he  turned towards the sea with a look of unutterable agony, held back by perhaps one glimmer of hope in the deep gloom of his soul. Suddenly his eyes light- en and the lips quiver. There is a dark mass near one of the scarred and ragged rocks! It may be, it is, the shawl in which the child was wrap- ped! The keen eye of the father sees a little white hand stretched out. Now for a quick grasp, and a sure step! Quick, for the sea is greedy to-day, aid remember the under-tow which only an old sailor understands on this shore.  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7484-00000085"/> 164        My Hero. Aye! Richard Armstrong remembers all. It is no child's play, as it was when he saved Mary Mudie's life, but a fierce hand to hand fight with an angry foe. Wary, eager as the tiger-like wave itself, he glides swiftly forward and grasps the child just as the incoming wave is about to seize it. It seemed as if the mighty will of this man bade those waters retreat, for he bore that child onward, nor stopped till he laid him high up on the warm sands. Aunt Martha was there with a stern, pale face. She could not speak, but kneeling down, she felt beneath the shawl for the little heart. It was beating, and then, "O God, I thank thee! burst from her lips as she bore him towards her home. Richard Armstrong followed with his wife. She was insensible when he brought her-in and laid her upon the bed. Her consciousness returned after a while, but only for a short time, then again life came back, and thus it eblbed and flowed all that night, till morning came, when, after one   Shadow and Tragedy. short interval of conscious life, the flickering candle went out to burn no more. The exposure of the previous night and the shock of the day had proved too much for the poor body, already worn by passion and excess. &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7484-00000086"/> CHAPTER V. SUNSHNE AFTER RAIN. S Jacob and Ruth are busy in school in England, and making Mr. Johns's life bright with their presence, Dick Barnard is traveling through the little villages of New Hampshire and Vermont in his peddler's cart, making money faster than he had dreamed of doing when he started on his route. Auntie Dole was surprised to receive a letter from him only three weeks after he left her shop. I am sorry that truth compels me to state that Dick Barnard was almost always at   ' 8$unshine 'after Rainc .    1 (7 the foot of the spelling class in school, and never went so far in his studies as English Grammar. He began by writing "Miss Doal" at the top of the sheet. Here Auntie Dole ,looked over her great horn spectacles at Jim Smith, the cooper, who had come to put some new hoops on her molasses barrels, for the little woman bought this article by the wholesale. "The fellow ought to be whipped for mis- spelling my name," she said; "he has known me ever since he was born, and has never learned it. I am sure it is easy enough." "Dick  can't spell nothin' but dollars and cents, Mise Dole; but he's a smart'un at spellin' them words." "I should think so.  Well, here's his letter." And she read as follows: "Miss DOAL: - Please send me by Joe March, the teamster, you know he goes to Grant's Corner every Thursday, twenty dozen of your horns of plenty, as many of them dogs as has a four paw up, and two dozen hosses what are prancin'. You may put in four dozen harts, rounds and dimonds.

Joe March will hand you the pay for the whole lot. I haint no cause to ask credit of you now. "Yours respectively, "DICK BARNARD.' "It is high time you had learned to spell, Dick," said the old lady, somewhat mollified how- ever by the large order and ready pay. Had she known that Dick was making fifty per cent. on her gingerbread handiwork, she might not have worked so hard as she did that day, getting a little girl to tend store while she put on a clean, white cotton cap and a long full apron, and shut herself up in her little kitchen, from which issued a most fragrant odor of compounded sweets all day long. Before two years had passed, Dick owned a large peddler's wagon, with various boxes and drawers, all nicely labeled, -  a traveling shop in apple-pie order," as he said, - ad two fine horses, hahdsome enough for any gentleman, as   Sunshine after Rain.     169 Jack told his mother. This poor, hard - working woman was much astonished one day at her wash - tub, to hear a sound as of horses tramping at her door, and Dick calling out, "tHurra! Mother, come out and see!" She took her hands out of the suds, and drew the sleeves over her thin, worn arms, and went out. There was Dick, in all the glory of his new red cart, and his "span" holding their heads up as if they shared their master's pride." Come, Mother, take a ride; put on your best bonnet and the red shawl I brought you, and get up here. " Dick, I am washing; I can't go possibly." "Yes you can, Mother. I'll fix the washing; you see I must be off again to - day; can't afford to stay at home with this turn - out. It cost lots of money, but it will help me to make it. Dick's mother was easily persuaded, and, before many minutes, was seated by Dick's side for a ride down to Auntie Dole's shop and to the  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7484-00000088"/> 170-       IMy Hero. post- office; for Dick had letters now - a - days from traders who sold him goods. They also stopped at Widow Smith's. She knit socks for Dick's cart, as did her sister, Polly, a sort of half- witted, good - natured girl, sometimes em- ployed by the neighbors as temporary help in the kitchen. "Halloo, Mother!" said Dick; "I have a bright thought. I sold Polly a gown  three months ago, and she has n't paid for it yet. I 'll let her work it out washing for you." Polly was therefore sent across lots to finish the washing, while Mrs. Barnard took a longer ride with her son. "Now did n't I speak the truth, Mother, when I told you, you should one day ride after a span of horses as good as Mr. Armstrong's grays?" "I never thought to see this day, Dick!" said the mother, as she sat back in the comfortable seat and rested her weary limbs, her wrinkled face smoothing itself a little, and looking around   Sunshine after Rain.     17] complacently on the few travelers in the village street. "It seems strange enough, Dick, to be riding where I have always walked, and to sit up here resting myself on a washing - day." "You will see more than that, Mother. I am going to be the richest man in this town, and I have made up my mind that New York is the place for me. After a few trips more, I shall hire a good smart fellow to peddle for me, and I will open a store in the city. You'll see me, one of these days, riding in a coach instead of a peddler's cart. Father always told me that money is power. I see it now, and, be jabers, if I do n't have it! I can see my way to it, slick and clean, right through." They made Auntie Dole a call, the little shop- keeper coming out in her turban and high- heeled shoes to speak to Mrs. Barnard, who could not come down from  her high seat with as much agility as her son.    &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7484-00000089"/> I (Z      My Hero. "You are getting up in the world, Mrs. Barnard," she said, and I am glad to see it. It is the first time you ever rode after such a span as those grays." "Yes," said Dick's mother, meekly. "Itis nice to ride when one is tired; but I think I would like a one-horse shay better than the cart, though it is a handsome concern," looking ad- miringly at the gayly-painted traveling shop, certain compartments of which Dick was filling with socks, yarn, and various knick- knacks that Auntie Dole had collected for him. He grew more fond of dress as his means increased, wore the gayest of vests, and exchanged the bright cotton neckerchiefs for long silk' ties. He was known far and wide as the peddler who brought the prettiest calicoes and brightest ribbons for the ladies, and the latest style of caps and neck - ties for young men. He knew all kinds of Tobacco, 'Solace," and "Golden Rose," and) all the rest. Young ladies appointed the wedding day with   Sunshine ajter tain.     173 reference to his monthly trips, and maids and grandmothers ordered their black silks of him. Dick was, chatty with all, and, though never losing sight of the main chance, was believed to be cheaper in his prices than the country merchants, or the numerous peddlers who tramped over the country with packs on their backs or drove less showy teams than Dick. The truth was, that Dick was fully up to the times, and knew very well how to spend one dollar that he might make two. He understood the tricks of his trade, was honest from policy, not principle, knew how to talk, was good -na- tured and healthy, and had one object in life,- to make money, and come home to show the neighbors that he was a rich man. His success was rapid. In four years from the time we intro- duced him to our readers, he was a junior partner in a New York dry goods store, the best salesman in the establishment, hoarding his money for a while, watching for some promising invest-  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7484-00000090"/> 174       My Hero. ment, -yes, waiting, watching with eager eyes, and spinning those strong, invisible threads to capture victims. Hundreds of such quick, wary human spiders abound in that great city, and their victims are numberless. But Dick never forgot his hard- working mother. He sent her money which, when her miserly, grasping husband did not get it from her to hoard in some Bank, was spent in making herself and her home more comfortable. But Jim Barnard, the father, had never been many miles beyond his few strong acres, and was absorbed in hoarding the little money which he made, unwilling that his hard - worked wife should hire her washing, or carpet the bare floors of-their cheerless home. Dick did this, however, and,from time to time, made the old house a'new place, rather too gayly furnished for good taste, but Dick liked bright things, and what Dick liked, the mother thought must be right. Dick had  long since ceased to trade with   Sunshine after Rain.     175 Auntie Dole, but her interest in his fortunes did not diminish, for he never came to the village that he did not make a call at her shop. As she grew older she gave up the care of the shop in a measure to a niece to whom she gave a home, spending more of her time in the room back of the shop, knitting or counting up her daily gains. The front door of her shop was furnished with a bell, which gave prompt notice whenever a cus- tomer appeared; the upper part of the door leading to the inner room was of glass, so that the old lady, while sitting at her fireside, might see all who entered. This room was a cozy place in winter, with its open wood fire, its bright brass andirons, its carpet made of strips of woolen of Various colors, woven together like basket- work, and some curious old pieces of furniture. Among these last was a table with as many legs as a spider, a corner cupboard with a set of little china cups and saucers that were brought from China by Auntie Dole's grandfather, and two or  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7484-00000091"/> 176       My Hero. three pitchers and vases from the same far country. A low, stuffed chair and a little round table, on which stood a basket with \knitting work in it, were always, in cold weather, drawn near the fire on the opposite side from the shop, and in a corner which afforded a view of the outer door. Here, every evening, the old lady sat, her gray cat at her feet, an ancient parrot on its perch in a cage near the window, and her brown pitcher of oat-meal gruel simmering on the warm hearth-stone. Into this room  the neighbors often came, and what the paper did not furnish in the way of news, the little knot of gossips supplied. One evening in early winter, Jim Barnard came in for a quarter of hyson tea, just as the village postmaster entered with Auntie Dole's paper, and a commission from his wife for some of Auntie's cough candy (a notable medicine at that time), for colds and coughs. While }he niece was weighing out the tea, Jim Barnard stepped in to   Sunshine after Rain.     1" tell the old lady that Dick was coming to spend Thanksgiving at home.  The postmaster fol- lowed. They were  no sooner  seated than Deacon Brown came to chat a little while, being a widower and finding home lonely. lHe was followed by Mrs. Hicks, an old crony of Auntie Dole, who never missed a: day without going to the shop. Thus there was quite a levee in the little back room, and talk was lively. The postmaster, having already read the paper, asked the deacon if he knew anything of a Captain Mudie, of Maine, who had died some months since, and whose estate was to be settled by Richard Armstrong, so the paper stated. "Mudie, Mudie," repeated the deacon; "yes, he- was an  old India sea captain. Jacob Stirling knew him well; was part owner once of a ship he sailed. I have seen him down to the port; a fine seaman; dead, did you say?" 'Yes, left one child, a daughter. Richard Armstrong is her guardian."  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7484-00000092"/> 178      A-  y Hero. "He might go a great ways before getting a better," said Auntie Dole, as sherounded the heel of her sock. "Richard Armstrong is a wise man, who minds his own business, and will never wrong friend or foe." "Good in his way, Mrs. Dole," said the deacon, "but not much  inclined to hear the preaching of the Word." "But pays the minister that others may hear," said the old lady. "Yes, yes, he is not a covetous man, sets a good example to some who profess more than himself. What's the news from  Dick, Mr. Barnard?" "Dick is doing well, Deacon, coming home to spend Thanksgiving. He 's got to be junior part ner now." "Making money as fast as ever?" asked Mrs. Hicks. "Yes ma'am, I guess so," said )the father,  always ready to talk about Dick; " made a pretty   Sunshine after cain.    1 sum of money t'other day buying and selling lot; "My cousin's son was here the other day said the postmaster; "he lives in New Yorl and he told me that Dick made ten thousa] dollars in buying and selling lots up in CentI Park.

"I showed him ho to count cents, four - pences and shillings, and, b, fore he could say his letters, he could sell pickle limes and gibralters, and make the change to half cent." Here the deacon, who had turned to the Bosto paper, now read aloud from the ship news: " Arrived, Brig Lenora from Liverpool Passengers, Richard Armstrong, Esq., ant Miss Mary Mudie and servant.' That must b Captain Mudie's daughter." The little group had hardly time to expres: their surprise, when Aunt Martha from Oakwooc  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7484-00000093"/> 180       My Hero. came in for some of Auntie Dole's diet bread, a plain cake which the old shop-keeper had a knack of making better than her neighbors. "You are in luck, Miss Martha," said the old lady, who numbered the housekeeper among her special friends; " there are two pans in the oven, and they are ris up as light as a sponge; if you will just walk into the back room and rest a bit, I will take the cake out the minute it is browned to a turn." When Auntie Dole went down to her kitchen, the little group in the shop gradually dispersed, and Aunt Martha sat by the open fire talking with Polly, who never failed to answer her, but was a mighty sullen and obstinate creature with most of the customers. She was screaming at the top of her voice,- "Polly wants a cracker Pretty Poll! Pretty Poll! Aunt Martha I Aunt Martha!Z Fire! Fire!

Aunt Martha was fond of a little gossip in her way, though a quiet sort of body and not given to scandal, and she assented. In truth there was something on her mind to-day, and she was sure it would be a comfort to talk matters over with Auntie Dole, who had learned, in her busi- ness, that discretion is better than tattling. These two cronies were not much like Sairy Gamp and Betsey Prig, plotting mischief in their gossip, for underneath the high plaid turban was not only shrewd worldly wisdom, but a warm heart sympathy for all distress, and admiration for goodness. True, she had a great deal of curios- ity, a trait not peculiar to the gentler sex, as the history of diplomacy has proved for the past few years.

That tea! Its fragrance was more exhilarating than most of the modern compounds, boiled, steeped or stewed by our modern Celtic coolks, When all was ready, the curtain was drawn over the window which looked into the shop, and the two old ladies sat down to the full enjoyment of their tea and their secrets. There are skillful generals, who, after laying siege to a city with consummate art, and knowing that the place must yield, still delay a little before the last stroke. Thus it was with Auntie Dole. She knew Miss Martha had some secret on her mind which she would fain yield, but the wary old lady, though more eager to possess than the other to reveal, still reconnoitered with great feint ofindifference, and led the talk all oyer the vil- lage, anywhere and everywhere away from Oak- l   Sunshine after Rain.     185 wood.

At last a pleasant little voice was heard in the shop, saying,- "Will thee please let me have a pound of thy best tea?" "Do you hear that child?" said Auntie Dole. "It is the pleasantest voice and prettiest face that come into the shop. I always give a bit of candy for her good manners; children arc getting rough now- a-days. They are not raised to respect old, people, as we were taught to do when we were girls. My mother would have whipped me if I forgot to courtesy to the minister, or dared to say yes and no to those older than myself." "Yes, young folks are very heedless, Miss Dole. Is this the little orphan that Jacob Stir-  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7484-00000096"/> 186       My tiero. ling's wife has adopted?" asked Miss Martha, "Yes; she is some far- away cousin, a poor child, but it may be a blessing that she is an orphan, now that she has a home with Jacob Stirling. No own parents could be kinder to children than Jacob Stirling and his wife to these orphans; and they bring 'em up in the good old- fashioned way." "Speaking of the Stirlings," said Miss Martha, C reminds me that Mr. Richard saw Jacob Stir- ling and Ruth Johns in London." "Indeed," said Auntie Dole, her eyes brighten- ing.  "Now  we are coming to it, I guess," she said to herself. Then aloud,- "Take a little more of the tea, Miss Martha; I have just put in afresh drawing." "I can not resist, for I do n't get such a cup of tea often. Well, as I was saying, Mr. Richard wrote to me"- "Then you do hear from him often," said Miss Dole.   Sunshine after Rain.     187 "How could I live without it? You know my baby is with him, my Dickie?" "Ah! yes, the dear child; and is he well?" said Auntie. "Quite well and happy, Miss Dole." "And how was Jacob and Ruth? A remark- able boy, that Jacob. He was born good, I believe, for he was never like common children. I can't say as much for Miss Ruth. She was handsome as a picture, but full of mischief. Only think of her dressing herself just like me, in turban and gold beads, and French shoes like mine; and making believe keep shop?  Dick Barnard told me of it." "She was full of frolic, Miss Dole, but had a warin heart. She was very fond of Dickie, and used to come every day to see him when he was sick. Mr. Richard says that she is a very accom- plished and beautiful young lady now, and that Jacob,--but let me see, I have some of his letters in my pocket, and I will read you what he  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7484-00000097"/> 188          Jnfy Hero. writes about Jacob."   She took two   or three letters from the capacious pocket of her black dress, and opening one read from it the following extract:- "I met Robert Johns, Sr., and his son Robert, and our little Ruth, that used to be, no longer that now, but one of the most beautiful and charming young ladies that I have ever met. Her eyes are as sparkling and mirthful as formerly, but she has learned the art of dressing and the art of pleasing to perfection. I think she would be a spoiledbeauty, were it not for the influence of two such minds as her father and Jacob. Of the latter I can only say, that he differs from all other young men with whom I come in contact. There is an earnestness and gravity of expression in those great brown eyes of his, and in his manner, which seems to indicate some earnest purpose in life. I found him a scholar in the studies whirh have been the solace of my life, not only a student of books, but an observer and an original thinker. If my son, Miss Martha, should come to be like Jacob Stirling, I could resign life without a murmur." "Just what we might expect Jacob     Stirling to be," said  Miss Dole.    "And he is coming home before long?" "Yes, in the course of a year.

"Yes, they were just speaking of it in the shop; and now, I hope Oakwood will be bright and cheerful again as it used to be in my girlhood, -in ours I should say, Miss Martha; it is of no use concealing the truth; it has been a gloomy place for many years." "Yes, yes, Miss Dole. I could think of nothing but the castle of Giant Despairwhenever I entered it in her day,-you know whom I mean." "Well enough, well enough, Miss Martha. The Lord in mercy has removed her," "No one could blame Mr. Richard if he did not mourn her much; but, for all the world can see, he has been as exemplary a widower as we women could desire." "That he has," said Miss Dole; " a drop more tea, Miss Martha." "It is coming now, surely, a greater secret than I expected," - to herself, but aloud, - Exem-  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7484-00000098"/> 190        Myy Hero. plary! the minister himself could n't be more so, if he should lose his wife. Exemplary! why, look at Deacon Brown taking Widow Snow   home under his umbrella, and his wife dead only six weeks! and Squire Coan marrying only six months after he laid his wife in the tomb! I have always been of the opinion that men are fickle creatures, Miss Martha; one thing is sure, there will be no 'Here lies the relict' onour tombstones,"said the old lady, as she stirred the tea leaves in her tiny tea-cup. "You may reckon safely on that," said Miss Martha. "I haven't much opinion of marriage anyhow; but as I was saying, Mr. Richard has been a widower for a long time." "Let me see," said Miss Dole, " it was three years last September. I 'll never forget that line storm, Miss Martha." r' It was more than a storm of wind and rain to me, as you may well imagine, Miss Dole. I live it over again in my dreams sometimes now,   Sunshine after Rain.      191 and start up all in a tremble; but all things are ordered for the best; perhaps it was a mercy to Mr. Richard. As I was saying, he has paid all outward respect to the memory of his wife, put up a great, marble monument, and built an iron fence around it, and never for two years at least took special notice of any ladies." "That he has n't, Miss Martha; never has the breath of slander so much as touched him. Mr. Richard is not considered a lady's man." I think, on that account, Miss Dole, he will set the people talking now. But I must read you another letter. It will tell you the story better than I can do it. It came this morning and I have been in a maze ever since, and I felt as if it would do me good to come and talk it over with you. Here is the letter':" "My1 DEAR MARTA A: Our darling boy is well and happy. My first sentence is always of him, because I know 'well what is the first thought in your heart when you open a letter.

His ship was to stop here, and he had requested his daughter to meet him here, and return in the ship to Yew York. It is very singular that, with all our Diclkies acquaint- ance with the 'pretty lady,' as he always called her, I had met her but once before my call upon her father in his last illness. I had been part owner of a vessel sailed by Captain Mudie for many years, and had met him in the way of busi- ness frequently. Ever since I rescued his daughter flom the surf on Hampton Beach, he has wished to see me, but has failed in all his attempts till we met accidentally in Liverpool. Two days after our first meeting, he was taken ill with a fever, and for three weeks was a great sufferer. It was my privilege to do all that lay in my power to alleviate his suffering, but no human aid could save him; his consti- tution was broken by years of hardship and exposure in an unhealthy climate. His daughter was left among strangers, save myself, and I ought to add Dickic. I can not tell you how hard the child tried to return some of the kindness which he had formerly received from her. I think he succeeded in a measure, for I heard her say once, with her arms around his neck, and his head pillowed on her breast,-' O Dickicl I should have died if it had not been for you I ' She is a very lovely woman, Martha. I promised her father that I would be her guardian, and that she should return to the United States under my care. She had no protector but a servant woman. You can imagine Dickie's delight on learning that we were not to be separated. And now, Martha, I can not tell you how it came about; it seems to be very strange and wonderful; perhaps my boy might have had something to do with it, for he loves Mnary with all the strength of his heart; but I havelearned also tkat I can not live without her, and that she loves me as well as my   Suashiie after Rain.        193 boy. I can not understand; I, a stern, gloomy man, twenty years her senior, and yet she prefers me to younger and gayer men. It seems as if my sad and barren life was suddenly garlanded with flowers, my autumn  turned again to spring"- "He need n't talk  so," said Miss Dole, who could keep silent no longer; " there is n't a young lady for thirty miles around, but would prefer the master of Oakwood to any young gentleman that can be found."' "That is true, Miss Dole; but Mr. Richard was never one to blow his own trumpet." True, he never needed; but I interrupt the letter." The woman went on witlh it: "We have just arrived, as you will perceive by the papers. Mary has few relatives, - one aged aunt in Maine. We shall proceed thither, and be married very quietly there next Thursday. I wish you to do all in your power to make Qakwhod bright and cheerful. Throw open ali the windows and let the sunlight in. Tell Briggs to trim, the two elms by the east window, and the oaks on the west, according to my wish expressed some time since. I trust to you, Martha, to give us such a welcome as I know your heart dictates. Dickie says, tell Aunt Martha that Miss Mary is going to live with him always and will sing ' Shining Shore.'" "Well, I declare, this beats all," said Auntie -            \  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7484-00000100"/> 194       My Hero. Dole, who had put on her horn spectacles as if she could hear more distinctly with them, as perhaps shecould. Theold ladywas as happy in the possession of her secret as a miser with hidden gold; and when in a week or two the mar- riage was announced, and the little shop buzzed with the news, Auntie Dole was most provokingly cool. "Yes, she had known all about it long ago," and she stoutly defended Mr. Richard from all the serious remarks of the gossiping neighbor- hood. Richard Armstrong could find no fault with Martha's preparations. Oakwood wore an air of most hearty welcome. It was a clear, cold day, bright with sunshine, when Dickie's ' pretty lady" rode up the avenue, her husband, quiet in his hap- piness, on one side of her, and the boy, restless and excited in his joy, on the other. "Now you are my Mamma," he said; "truly my Mamma, and we will always live) in Oakwood, and never, never go away any more."   CHAPTER VI. COAL MNES AND MNERS. HE thoughtful old man who looks back upon his life, will often recall turning-points in that journey, little incidents which at the time seemed trivial, or words spoken in haste that have turned the whole course of his after travel to the end. It may have been the words spoken by Grandma Stirling one summer's evening, when Jacob asked her about Him who though rich became poor, and made His home with the sorrowing and the sinful that He might lessen human suffering and  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7484-00000101"/> 196       My Hero. human guilt, that had such influence on Jacob's after life. Certainly they were seed sown in good soil, and if his course was not determined by them, they served to strengthen a purpose from which neither wealth nor prospect of worldly advancement could win him. He was a student, in pure mathematical studies attaining only a medium standing in his class, and that with difficulty, but in natural science he became almost an enthusiast. These studies have occupied the leading minds of England for the last half century, and Jacob's teachers were men who loved, their work and inspired their pupils with their own zeal. Murchison, at the head of the Royal Geograph- ical Society, was pushing investigation into hitherto unknown regions of the globe; Living- stone had gone forth to carry the gospel to Africa, and bring back to us a definite knowledge of that land of darkness and doubt,)where fabled monsters dwelt in vast deserts, and rivers run,   Coal Mines and Miners.    197 over sands of gold, but where man was scarcely above the wild beasts which dwelt in the jungles. Jacob read and listened, keeping abreast with the knowledge of the day in that quarter of the globe. Astronomy, too, opened its wonders to him, and step by step he gained a knowledge of this science, till Night unbound for him her mas- sive book, whose blue covers, silver - decked, had hitherto been-sealed to his eyes. He drank in this knowledge with a loving, reverent spirit, worshiping Him who looseth the bands of Orion for the patient student, and whispers to the list- ening ear the wonders of the Pleiades. The morning watch often found Jacob at his books, during the winters which he devoted to this&amp;study, for so closely was the science of mathematics interwoven with astronomy, that they taxed his utmost strength. He was amply paid for his toil, by a higher grasp of thought and a greater exactness of knowledge. Next came the surface of the earth, and the things beneath,  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7484-00000102"/> 198        M y Hero. till the scholar felt this life all too short for half that he wished to learn. For a while it seemed to him that money was to be desired only because it could buy books, aid us to traverse the world for more information of its own features, and the races of men and animals that dwelt therein, and furnish telescopes, microscopes and all the philosophical apparatus so valuable to the scholar. He was thankful, every day of his life, to Mr. Johns for opening to him these wonderful sources of enjoyment and power. On the other hand, his patron began to be proud of him. The little, quiet Quaker boy was becoming known, among his classmates and teachers, as the highest on the list of scholars in those departments. Fearing that he might become too much of a student, Robert Johns urged physical exercise upon the boy; and Jacob, somewhat disinclined that way, nevertheless, out of his )gratitude to his friend, boated and played athletic games,. and   coal Mines and Mianers.    199 practiced walking, till the broadened chest, erect head and greater strength of body were proof of the soundness of the advice. Jacob's vacations were passed in London, where he was always welcomed by UncleRobert, as he called Mr. Johns, and by Cousin Ruth. The little girl had not stood still during these years of hard study to Jacob. Her father could not part with her, and therefore employed a gov- erness and private tutors. She had not Jacob's enthusiasm in study, but, with a natural love of music and good teachers, had made progress enough in that study to afford her father much pleasure. She could talk French fluently, danced with much grace, and was very fond of gayety, waiting eagerly for the time when she should finish her studies and launch her bright boat on the sunny waters which rippled to her eyes in the distance. Jacob completed his four years of study, and came off with some of the highest honors of his  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7484-00000103"/> 200        M ly Hero. class. Mr. Johns wrote a long letter to his old friends, Jacob Stirling and his wife Susan, upon - the occasion. How that letter was received we shall learn in another place. We will only add here, that Jacob would spend one year in travel, then return home for a visit. In accordance with this plan, Mr. Johns proposed to accompany Jacob and Ruth on a tour to the continent, extending it, if they wished, to the east. Busi- ness detained him in London for some weeks, and this interval of time Jacob desired to improve in visiting certain parts of England where large collieries are established. His studies had led to an interest in the immense coal beds which underlie the northern part of the island. And here again was one of those turning points, one of those pauses in life, which throw their shadow or their sunshine over all the future. The day before his departure, ile traversed a large district of the city, where the poor, mis-   Coal Mines and Miners.    201 erable creatures dwelt to whom life is one long scene of hunger, wretchedness and crime. His heart ached as he saw only the outside of this degradation; what those old, moldy, tumble- down houses by the river-\side in the densely populated portion contained, south of the Thames,' lying hid from human view, could only be guessed, not comprehended. As he wandered through these suburbs, there came to his ears, in a still, small voice, distinct and clear, above the din of traffic and through the smoke that rested drearily over all, the grandmother's voice, as she said, -"Jesus Christ was infinitely happy, my boy, in that He came, not to be ministered unto, but to minister." As\Jacob turned back towards the west end of the town, past the massive pile where gathered the lords of the realm, - who should stand to these thirsting, hungry, naked men and women, and these vicious, sin-begotten children, as stewards and ministers of Him who gave them wealth and  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7484-00000104"/> ,VS      -'/My Hero. power, - he paused, and said to himself, "Life is a mystery. This is a Christian land. Yonder stands St. Paul's, raised in memory of Him who said, TI count all things but loss that I may know the fellowship of His sufferings'! The fellowship of His sufferings, who came to bring peace and good will to earth, to heal the sick, open the eyes of the blind, make the lame to walk and the sick to be healed. A Christian people, whose churches dot the land as stars the firmament, and where the consecrated apostolic representatives of our Lord are found in every hamlet of the land, - where the coffers of the church are full of gold, where wealth grasps broad acres and ample homes, but where ten thousand wanderers each day know not where to lay their heads when weary of their toil." Onward Jacob walked that day, past the gar- dens on which royal taste had lavished millions, on by noble houses and palaces, threading his way amid carriages where liveried lackeys waited on   Coal M2ines and Miners.    203 the pomp of show,--on, till he turned into Belgrave Square, where the comparative quiet of the street and the beauty of the architecture of those noble houses were as delightful to the nerves as they were agreeable to the taste of our young scholar. "The ebb and flow of human life," he thought; "high tide and low tide, the swell and the fall, a heaven here, a hell. there. Poverty and disease in their most disgusting forms there, health and refinement here,-' work - work - work,' there, I take thine ease, my soul,' here." He had walked more than five miles, when he turned at last into Manchester Square, where Robert Johns resided. As he went up the steps ofthe house, and was admitted by the footman into a pleasant and comfortable home, unostenta- tious, but with all the appliances and improve- ments which make life a luxury, his thoughts still dwelt on the contrasts which even these few miles had presented. He went to his own apartments,  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7484-00000105"/> 204        My Hero. cast off the dusty garments of travel, plunged into a warm bath, and came out at last from his dressing-room, a well appareled, fine looking young man, healthy, vigorous, all armed to fight the battle of life. He could not shake off, with his dusty garments, the troublesome questions that recurred again and again to him. "Is Christianity a failure? Has Christ lived in vain? Eighteen centuries of time since He set us the example of a life consecrated to the elevation of the race! Ought not the leaven of His teaching by this time to pervade the world? Instead of this, here, under the shadow of the most beautiful of all Prot- estant churches, I have found men and women who never heard of Jesus of Nazareth!" A sort of despair seized him, and he recalled the remark of Richard Armstrong, - Life is a doubtful blessing." But Richard Armstrong believed only in this life, and he had seen the world and knew the sin and suffering whicVhpervaded it. Jacob had been reared in asimple faith, a faith   Coal Mines and Miners.     205 that had shaken off the trammels of forms and the burden of ceremonies, but had grasped the great truths of revelation with a quiet of firmness and an absence of controversy that made its mem- bers more like living epistles, known and read of all men, than those of many sects who numbered more adherents. His scientific studies had never shaken his religious belief. "Given immortality," he said, " what progress may we not predicate of the future? Believing this, may not our lives here be like reading the opening chapter of a glorious book, the end 'of which is only to be learned there? If so, then perchance Christ's life is the preparation for the immortal existence beyond this world?  But this is binding on each -follower. I have blamed the great mass of Christians, and yet I follow afar off myself." And then he fell into a musing mood, when' the vision of his childhood came before him, of. the grand and beautiful hospital he would build, where the sick would come to be healed, and  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7484-00000106"/> 206       My Hero. where he would live surrounded by those whom his skill or his kindness could heal or soothe. It was not the first time that this dream had occurred to him. Often, again and again, it had come before him, in the watches of the night, in his walks, even in the midst of his studies; the picture presented itself, and was never wholly lost amid all the changes of his daily life. "Yes, yes," he said, as the clock struck, warning him of the dinner hour, "I will be trustworthy, God helping me. I will make Christ's life my model. My life- work shall be to raise the degraded, help the oppressed, min- istering unto others, not seeking mine own." As he walked into the dining -room he found it glowing with light, and some distinguished genitlemen present, scientific men whom Jacob held in great admiration, and whose conversation was better than the richest viands of the table. Robert Johns was now a dignified )gentleman of middle age, easy and affable in his address, of   Coal Mines and Miners.    207 somewhat extensive reading and much observa- tion, and who drew to his own home many kindred spirits. Ruth, radiant in her fresh, girlish beauty, tastefully dressed, bore her part with a quiet self - possession rare at her age. The eyes of both father and daughter rested on Jacob as he entered the room, one with a fatherly pride in the young man, and a faith in his at- taining much honor in the future; Ruth with an affection which had grown with the years they had been together, and a perfect trust in him such as even sisters seldom feel towards brothers. The conversation that day turned upon the vast coal formations of the world, taking that course, perhaps, from the fact that Jacob was to start on the morrow for the north of England. An ani- mated discussion took place, in which the origin of coal was explained on, various hypotheses, but to each one objections were urged, till Ruth thought they were confounded by their own wis- dom. They talked of   strata" and "beds" and !  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7484-00000107"/> 208        My Hero. "basins," "old red sandstone" and "shale," "dips" and "seams,"  bassets" and "outcrop," "dykes," "faults and seams," all so much Greek to her, for her studies had not taken that direc- tion. But when she heard that there were in Great Britain and Scotland over six millions of acres of workable coal, she did understand to what great national industry this amount must give rise. From this conversation she also gleaned that, for ages and  ages back, long before the higher forms of animal life appeared on this globe, it was stored in the great cellars of the earth for the use of man, - stored so exten- sively and so freely by the beneficent hand of God, that there seems no possibility of exhaust- ing it. Europe and Asia, and even the islands of the sea hold it in their subterranean store- houses, while the great continent of America has the largest deposits in the known world, one area alone, in the western part of the nhited States, covering 63,000 square miles. She looked at   Coal Mines and Miners.    209 the large room, brilliant with its gas lights, and thought of our debt to coal, at the glowing coal in the grate, and remembered the warmth and comfort derived from it. But never until that evening had she asked the question,- How does this coal, so extensively used, and so necessary to civilized life, get to our houses? It lies far be- neath our feet; buried in the caverns of the earth-,- and great stones are rolled over the entrance. These men were wise and thoughtful. But it is only now and then, at great intervals of time, that a man is found who deviates from' the ways into which he is born, who has courage to throw away the blinders which he assumes when he goes out into the world, and looks all around him, using the muscles which nature has given him to look behind as well as before. But Jacob had already thrown off his blinders; he was looking and thinking, and with sadness came wisdom. Turning to Professor Dort, who had just re- turned from a visit to the collieries of Northum-  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7484-00000108"/> 210        My Hero. berland, he asked him to explain the present im- proved mode of getting coal from great depths,- the very question, thought Ruth, which she wanted to ask herself. "Will you be so kind, Professor Dort;" she said, "as to give us your description with as few technical terms as possible. I must confess to more interest in learning how the coal is got out than when it was put in." "Thank you, Miss Johns, for your interest. There need be few technical terms, unless we call those such which the laborers themselves use, and which have seemed to spring, like many other words in our language, from the necessity of new words for new work. You already un- derstand that those masses of coal are sometimes thrown out of place; we do not always find them as we expect, and mistakes and disappointments often occur; but we will suppose that, by boring, we have good reason to believe that coal can be found; we then sink a shaft. This is ten or   ,  oal Mines and Miiners.   21 fifteen feet in diameter, and may be in the form of a cylinder or ellipse. But, as we proceed, the soil becomes loose, and would fall in, were it not bricked or walled, and this is some- times done down to the solid rock. Then again, the work is made difficult by the water, which sometimes flows in from the sides of the shaft; then it must be tubed with boards or metal, the water meanwhile being drawn off by an engine kept constantly at work." "And how deep may these shafts be made?" inquired Ruth. ( The deepest which I have ever seen is eights een hundred feet; this depth had to be reached before a workable seam of coal was found in the district I examined.' "But now, Sir, we are only to the coal, eight- een hundred feet, as I understand, below the surface of the ground, and the coal lies thick and deep beneath. We can not draw it up like water." &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7484-00000109"/> 212        My He7'o. "No, Miss Ruth, I wish we could. But now, if you will furnish me with a sheet of drawing paper, I will sketch a subterranean town for you, where men and boys live a great part of their lives. When we reach the coal, we stop working vertically, and make roads in opposite directions into the seam of coal; these roads are more than eight feet broad and so high that the rock just above the seam of coal forms the roof; then a long, level gallery is made to collect the water. Roads or passages continue to be made till the bed of coal is entirely laid open, and intersected by parallel passages. At last we have a town with broad streets, and narrow passages leading to them,--a town with roof of solid rock, through which no sunshine penetrates, and which the sweet, pure air of heaven shuns to enter,- a town with pavements of ebony, and solid, hewn pillars, dark as night. Here you see a rough sketch of this subterranean city, hewn out for many hundreds to dwell in. I should tell   Coal Mines aend Miners.   2 you that fresh air is supplied by sinking another shaft, and making a horizontal communication with the first. By means of fires at one of the shafts, and doors which open and shut, a cur- rent of pure air is admitted, and the city partially ventilated; though it is always warm in a coal mine, and the men often sigh and groan at their- labor, as if heavily oppressed. The work is di- vided among the men, there being as many grades in a large coal mine as there are in a reg- iment of soldiers. There are degrees to which the younger workmen aspire with as much ambi- tion as men in the army. As a large quantity of coal is left at first for the support of the roof, this is gradually hewn away, and other supports sub- stituted. "Now and then a roof falls in and crushes some of the best workmen, but these instances are rare. The first workmen engaged directly in getting the coal are the hewers, who first cut a narrow opening in the coal, and then blow up  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7484-00000110"/> 214        My Hero. large masses with gunpowder. Many tons are loosened at once. 'When broken sufficiently, the coal is put into baskets and drawn along the tram - road by boys to the broader road, or head- ways, where it is conveyed by wagons to the bottom of the shaft, and raised to the surface by means of steam. "Men can seldom work standing erect in a coal mine; sometimes they lie on their sides, at other times in a bent posture, never in a very comfort- able position. They work half naked, on ac- count of the heat, and are covered wig perspira- tion and coal dust, looking, in the dim light of these lower regions, like creatures less than hu- man. "Excuse me, Miss Ruth, if I have presented an unwelcome picture for your eyes to gaze upon, but, really, the life in a coal mine is so strange and weird, so full of toil and tragedy, that it may be well to turn sometimes from the brightness of a spacious room, warmed and lighted like this,   Coal ilfines and Miners.   215 to the source whence we draw this heat and brightness." Ruth's earnest face expressed both interest and curiosity as she replied: "It seems to me so new and strange, Professor, that I only wonder that I have never sought to know something of these people who work a thousand feet below the sur- face of the earth, that we may be fed, warmed and lighted above. You said the sunlight did not penetrate there; they can not do all this in the dark; pray tell me how they light these 'gloomy cities, where gunpowder is used in such profusion?  Aye, my dear lady, there is a daner greater than gunpowder,-an explosive agent, invisible but deadly, that always lurks, like' an evil spirit, in these dreary towns. Imprisoned in the coal beds is an inflammable gas, lighter than common air, which often issues from the fractures made by blasting powder, and comes, too, in many cases, from beneath the picker's ax. This poisonous   &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7484-00000111"/> 1U    ,.   My A e ero. gas, or fire-damp, as the miners call it, takes terrible revenge for its ages of captivity, and bursts out with great velocity, forming, with the common air, a mixture that explodes with the least spark which comes in contact with it. Then comes terrible' destruction of life; great masses of rock and coal are heaved from their places, and human beings are tossed like leaves in the tempest. A  greater horror lurks behind this, for the explosion sets the coal on fire, and the mine glows like a fierce furnace, where no human aid comes to the poor creatures doomed to a death of awful torture. "You asked how these under-ground cities are lighted. When our coal beds were first worked, there were many accidents from the use of candles. Sir Humphrey Davy, as you may be aware, invented a safety lamp which miners wear in their caps. It is simply a lamp covered with wire gauze, through which the caybureted hydro- gen gas,--excuse me, I promised to use no   Coal Mines and lf1iners.   217 technical phrases,-the fire-damp will not pass.' "I am glad to learn," said Jacob, interrupting the conversation for the first time, "that later inventors have improved Sir Humphrey's lamp; the gauze is finer and the flame is covered with a glass cylinder; but I apprehend, Professor, that the safety of our mining population depends more upon proper ventilation of the mines, than upon the best lamps a philosopher can make. This fire- damp is lighter than common air; let capital and science be turned to discovering the best mode of carrying this gas out of the mines, and there will be less loss of life than at present." The evening passed away, and though the Conversation turned upon other topics, and though Ruth's music enlivened the hour, yet her usually bright face looked serious and thoughtful. Jacob, on the contrary, looked serene, with a glow in his dark brown eyes as if some happy thoughts stirred heart and brain.- They were blessed  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7484-00000112"/> 218       My Hero. thoughts, for they took in the thousands of poor, ignorant, degraded men,- comprehended, as it were, their toil and their danger, and, without wasting a moment in pity that could not relieve, he said to himself,- "Here is a field for the man who would carry science and the gospel hand in hand." The great hospital canme to his dreams that night, but it stood over a subterranean cave, into which he saw angels descending and ascend- ing on a flight of marble steps; and as he looked down, men were at work, busy as bees in a hive, but singing as they toiled; now  the song changed, and the hum 9f merry voices came to his ears, and lights gleamed here and there in the deep cavern like stars in the vault of heaven. When Jacob rose the next morning, he had only time to breakfast, and bid a hasty adieu to his guardian and Ruth, before the early morning train bore him from London on the great north- ern railway, through the cultivated farms and broad fields of Hertford, past the historic scenes   Coal Mines and Miners.    219 of Huntington and the old classic region of Lin- coln,-- on past them all; though Jacob, well read in English history, andloving the land of his fathers, would have enjoyed lingering among them. But now his time was short, and a deeper feel- ing than mere interest in the geological formation of the coal region urged him forward. His first point was Northumberland. Here the immense coal - field, with the sea for its eastern boundary, was to him a most interesting subject of investi- gation, and here, if anywhere in the world, science has aided labor. Our story is no scien- tific treatise, and therefore we will just descend and take one glance at the toilers in the rock, leaving the strata of the rocks, and the dips, bends and seams for Jacob's note -book. e re- corded all these, and then descended to spend one day with the workmen.   He went down into the mine five hundred yards beneath the sur- face, and traversed two miles or more of narrow V   &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7484-00000113"/> 220        My Hero. subterranean passages, dimly lighted by occasion. al lamps. Following one of the workmen, he saw him join his companions who were at work in a space not over four feet high, using their tools in a bent posture, two or three of them lying on their sides, and all covered with coal - dust which the moisture of their bodies had caused to adhere like paste. Boys from ten to fifteen years of age were dragging the coal through the tram- ways, harnessed by belt and chain to corves, a sort of basket, into which the newly cut coal is placed; they went through some of the passages on hands and feet, in the thick, black mud which is often found in the mines. On expressing his regret at seeing so many young boys there, who ought to be in school, one of the workmen re- plied,- "Aye, Sir, and if ye had come down in my day, ye wad have seen littler fellows than them. I worked in a Yorkshire mine, Sir, -and was a L trapper. I was only six years old, Sir, when!   7T    CCoal Mines and Miners.    221 went down with my father every morning at break of day, and stayed twelve hours in the mine. A trapper, Sir, is a little boy who opens and shuts the gates when the wagons pass and repass on the tram - roads. I sat all day in a hole dug out of the coal beside the gate, and some- times it was very wet and dark. Times is get- ting better now, but hard enough, Sir." The grimy, half-nude men were profane and vulgar, very ignorant, and as reckless of life themselves as their more intelligent but greedy employers. Jacob found a new world of people, a multitude, almost as ignorant and depraved as the heathen to whom we send our missionaries. Traveling southward, he came to a district where the coal lies in one deep, compact bed, twenty miles long and seven broad. It had been worked for many years. He came to it by railroad at night, and strange and weird was its appearance. The whole area looked like a great village, filled with miserable cottages, thrown- here and there, I  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7484-00000114"/> 222        My Hero. with heaps of tanhes, piles of cinders, and tall chimneys for blast furnaces. Now a blazing furnace glowed in the darkness of the night, throwing its lurid light on the surrounding wretchedness; then night settled down, to be re- lieved again by masses of burning coal, or a heap of iron - stone in the process of calcining. The roads wound around among all this debris, now above it like a causeway, and now far down like the cutting on a railway. Blackness of darkness, relieved only by that lurid light which made the traveler almost wish for the pall of darkness again. Jacob found, on referring to his letters, that he could give one week to this spot, an - interesting one to the geologist, and a painful one to the Christian who feels that he is his brother's keeper. A few hours in a house that rested partly over the mouth of an old coal- pit, and on ground where his footsteps echoed as over a cave, and he went forth to sirvey the scene by daylight. He found himself treading the   Coal Mines and Miners.    223 roof of a great subterranean city, the excavations of which had made the roads above to rise and fall as if an earthquake had shaken them. Hearing a noise as of a falling building, he turned in the direction from which the sound proceeded, and found two contiguous cottages had fallen. His guide expressed no surprise. "It is a common occurrence here, Sir. Look at the little parsonage and school - house yonder; it is made in such a way that, when it gets out of the perpendicular, which it frequently does, it can be screwed up again; nothing very solid here, Sir; on this road we now go up, and then go down, as the children say; but it was formerly on a level, and if we wait long enough it will be again, if that, devil of a choke- damp could be kept out of the cellars we wouldn't complain of our tumble - down houses and up, and down streets." Such were the homes to which the miners re- turned after their under-ground labors, and Jacob  &#xD;<pb n="224 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7484-00000115"/> 224        My, Hero. went down to see how they lived the remaining twelve hours of the day. Down, down in a little carriage propelled by a steam engine, till all that was left of sky above was a small patch of blue, and then he passed away from that into what seemed at first a great darkness, to which in a moment his eye became accustomed, and then he could see at first a moving throng of black, shadowy - looking creatures, and could hear the sound of pickaxes, falling coal, trundling of wheels and driving of horses. The mine was better ventilated than many others, and lamps were used. He carried a couple of extra candles in his hand, and was passing one of the trap- doors, when a piteous little voice said, - "Please, Sir, give me a little of your grease." Jacob looked around, but could see no one. "Here, Sir, here behind the trap -door," was heard in the same tone. Turning his light in that direction, he saw a little heap of rags from out of which peered the head of a child. He held in his hand a cord at-    - i:  Here, Sir, here behind the trap-door."

From sunrise to sunset the boy sat in darkness, no light being allowed by the overseer; but he had scooped out a little place in the rock, and, having procured a wick, he begged occasionally a little grease, and so made a feeble light his greatest pleasure. He had known little in his short life of sunshiny holidays, of plays on the green, of birds or flowers, and never owned any toys; but, in common with all children, he did not like the darkness, and Jacob's present of a farthing candle made him a happy child all that day. The first objects which arrested Jacob's sympa- thy were the poor horses, prisoners in this gloomy cavern, hardly worked, beaten, buried before their time far below green fields and sunshine. One poor blind creature, who had lost. his eyes by an accident in the mine, was doing his work in a resigned, patient way which touched Jacob's heart.  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7484-00000117"/> 226       My Hero. "What shall I give you to let that horse rest a week on the green hill-side just beyond the village?" he said to the "buttie," or contractor for the mine - work, and who owned the horse. "Indeed, Sir, I dunno; he's a good fellow to work; knows more 'n most of the men; could do his work, blind as he is; without a driver; been down here now over a year." "So much the more need of a vacation; and I will pay you the worth of his week's labor if you will give it to him." A bargain was struck, and Jacob had the pleasure of seeing the poor animal hoisted to the world above, and to the rest of a sweet, green field away from the noise of pickax and whip. But before Jacob hadtraversed two miles of the mine, he wished that he could do as kind a deed to the workmen as to the horse. There were stout men there, men with chest and arms developed like an athlete, but tley were all of a deadly paleness; at least, all those whose faces    Coal Mines and Miners.     227 were not begrimed with coal -dust. He.stayed all day with the workmen, watching each class, the " holers," who are the first to attack the coal, the "pickers," who bring it down, the "turners out," who break it, the "loaders," who place it upon the skiffs, the " horse drivers," who take it along the iron tram-ways, the "hangers on," who attach it to the hook of the chain by which the steam engine hoists it to the surface. Besides all these, are the "dirt carriers," who pile the slack in great heaps, called   "gobs."   The " buttie," as we have said, is the contractor for the work, and the "doggie" directs the pikemen. Jacob mingled freely with them all, sat down and ate his dinner with them. He did not wonder, as he saw their utter ignorance and their indifference 'to danger, that the men who superin- tended the work became indifferent and reckless of the safety and comfort of these who cared so little for themselves. Darkness, poverty, impure air and coal- dust are great impediments to god-  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7484-00000118"/> 228        Ay Hero. liness and a pure life. They are forbidden to smoke in the mine, but they will do it at the risk of their lives. "We will give you a blast after dinner, Mister," said one workman to Jacob. The workman's unprotected candle stood by *his side. "Wheredo you keep your powder?" said Jacob. "In that cask ye 're sittin' on," was the cool reply. "You must n't complain of the doggies," said Jacob, as he rose and removed the candle to a safe distance, " if you run such risks as this." "Aye, Sir, if you could see what I have seen, ye would n't feel kindly to the doggies, though I aint a complainin' of ours. After a fall of coal it is worse than a battle -field to be forced to go and draw coals before it is settled and made secure; and perhaps the doggies will say, - in; wemust have these coals drn out.' 'Go in; we must have these coals draWn out.'   Coal Mines and MiVneirs.   229 When I worked in Tipton last year, I remember a man being killed by being hurried to his work when the roof was rotten, and a rock fell upon him and made a great hole in his side. I really think the man's life might have been saved if the doggie had just looked a moment before he sent the man." '"If the owners would only drain the mines better," said another workman. "I have worked all day long, month in and month out, over my ankles in water, and the roof dripping like rain all the time. The boys fret about this more than the men. In my younger days, girls and boys worked together in the mines, and they would be wet to the skin in a few minutes after they began work, and so hot they could n't bear many clothes on. You would have felt sorry for the poor things, Sir, when they were hoisted up at night, to see them shiver all the way to their homes, a mile beyond the mines, may be. But girls do n't come much now; the law do n't allow  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7484-00000119"/> 230        My Hero. them. It don't permit them to go down into the mines, except now and then." Nor you to smoke, "said Jacob to one man who was lighting his pipe. But they are not hard on a fellow just for tak- ing a bit of comfort," said the man. "Nor for running the risk of blowing us all up with gunpowder," said Jacob. "Put up your pipe, or I shall report you." The man obeyed sullenly, though he knew the powder was near the path he must traverse to hid work. "It is no sort of use to try and make them careful," said- one of the " butties" to Jacob. "They care for little besides eating, drinking and smoking; they are just like cattle. You mast drive 'em and 't ain't no use teaching 'em, 'cause ye see they can't live like other folks any how. If you want to please a miner, give him plenty of'backer and beer, and iet him aloMe. Preaching and meetings and books are n't for   Coal Mines and 3iinzers.   31 the like of him who only sees one day of sunlight in seven." Jacob ascended at night, a little in advance of the gang who came up at the close of the work- day, and watched the grimy procession go their way to their wretched, tunable - down houses. He saw them again in the evening, when they clus- tered in the little whiskey shops to spend an hour or two in drinking and quarreling. He staid in the village on Sunday where a few entered the little chapel to worship God, gaining a little knowledge of a higher, better life. "I dunno, I dunno," said one old man to Jacob. "I've worked hard all my life, and never could get money enough to eat more than two meals of 4neat a week. I am old and poor now; do you believe I 'll ever win to a better world than this?" ' I hope so, my friend," said Jacob. '"Where there are no butties nor doggies, to drive us poor fellows that must dig coal all the year through or starve?"  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7484-00000120"/> 232        My Hero. Where there are no butties nor doggies, my good friend, and where hunger and thirst, death and sorrow can not come." The tears rolled down the old man's cheeks. "You see, Sir, I have thought much about these things since my two boys were blown up in Haswell colliery. It was an awful day. The two boys were all the children I had; and when they brought them out to me, blackened and burnt, the arms of my Johnny gone, and Jim's eye blown out his head, I almost went crazy, and wished there were n't no world, nor no coal beds, nor no nothing; but there were ninety - three other bodies all stark and dead, and many of 'em so burnt and blown to pieces that mothers did n't know their own children. I hear the screams and curses, yes, curses, Sir, of those women in my sleep some times now - a- days. Aye, Sir, it is a weary world, where so many must work all their. lives in the dark and the wet, just) to keep soul and body together,"   CHAPTER VII. EUROPEAN TRAVEL. HE old man, whose words ended our last chapter, spoke a sad truth when he said,-"It is a weary world where so many must work all their lives in thee dark and the wet and the cold, just to keep soul and body together."  The poet expresses the same thought with more elegance,- "For man must work and woman must weep, And there's little to earn and many to keep." This world, however, was seen only on its bright side by Ruth Johns, when she started on  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7484-00000121"/> 234        My Hero. her travels with her father and Jacob. Never was there a gayer, livelier little woman than this same Ruth, rousing Jacob from his long reveries, and making him almost forget at times that there was anything in this world besides her bonny little self. She saw everything in rose color, Holland, with its slow moving people, its stag- nant canals, its formal gardens, and its frogs, flies and boats, afforded her great amusement. When Jacob criticised them, she said,- "But, cousin dear, they are so clever. Broek is a jewel of a place; none of that dust, which your wise Professor Dort said was full of- of- an awful hard word to speak, but it means germs of all sorts of living creatures. I have proposed to Papa to buy a little gingerbread house here, with a painted stable where a white cow stands on a mosaic pavement of blue and white, with her tail tied to a ring, and her horns ornamented with a blue ribbon. Near by is a little summer- house, where we could take tea every summer   European Travel.      235 evening. The motto over the entrance is,- 'The Home of Peace.' I am  willing to stop here and go no further." But when Paris was reached, Ruth concluded, like the Queen of Sheba when she went to Solo- monis palace, that the half had not been told her. She was willing to leave it only because she could stay longer on her return. When she visited Germany, with its old castles and its lofty cathe-y  drals, she was filled with wonder and awe; and when she went up the Alps, as she did, her countenance was beautiful to look at, for the spirit of worship was there as she said to Jacob,- "'The strength of the hills."' As the scenes changed, so changed her power of reception, and every day brought some new delight, unalloyed it would seem, for she was subject to no moodiness of temper, no low spirits. Perhaps Ruth at that time was a superficial think- er, and never having had an experience of sorrow -the plummet- line of souls,- she knew nothing  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7484-00000122"/> 236       My Hero. of that feeling so strongly expressed by Saint Paul, and often recalled by Jacob,- " the fellow- ship of Christ's sufferings." Sometimes Jacob absented himself for a day at a time, on expeditions in which neither Mr. Johns nor Ruth cared to accompany him. In Germany and  Austria he visited the collieries and passed many hours in them. His familiarity with the French, German -and Italian languages enabled him to talk freely with the in- habitants. When Ruth lingered day after day among the pictures 6f the Louvre, he was inspecting prisons and hospitals. His soul was overwhelmed with the vast amount of sin and suffering in this world, and the indifference to it in the followers of Him who has said,--"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, ye have done it unto me." He said very little upon the sibject, only oc- casionally, when Ruth rallied him upon his ab-   European Travel.      237 sence he would say in a tone that showed how his heart was touched,- "Ah, Ruth, I am glad you were not with me; what a mystery this world is sometimes to us! Hard by the palace is the prison, the dungeon perchance, where good men are shut from the life and light of the world, for mere' political opinions perhaps, or for too much freedom of speech.  Yonder, by the sunny sea, where pleasure- seekers float idly, in an ennui of gay- ety, thousands of men, chained together, work at the galleys, the mere wrecks of humanity, semi - demons in deformity of soul. Sometimes I feel as if I wanted to raise a Crusade of Chris- tians of all sects, who are followers of Jesus Christ, to give their wealth, time and lives, if need be, to redeem a world from suffering and crime. Thousands toil all their lives that a few may live at ease, and hundreds live in palaces sur- rounded by acres upon acres of cultivated fields, because millions live in wretched hovels, deprived  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7484-00000123"/> 238        My Hero. of pure water and fresh air. It seems to me, Ruth, if we possessed the spirit of apostolic Chris- tianity, the world would not be in this condition. There are many millions of Christians in Europe and America, enough to raise humanity to a higher level; and while they are doing much, what do they know of self- sacrifice, of fellowship with Him who said to one,-'Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? Can ye be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?' "But come, Ruth, we will go to Godesberg, to - day, where we can cross the Rhine in a ferry boat to Koningswinter, and see the Sev-en Moun- tains." "One of which is the Drachenfels," replied Ruth. "Yes;  don't you remember the   poem?" asked Jacob. And he recited,- ( The castled crag of Drachenfels Frowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine, Whose breast of waters broadly swells Between the banks which bear the vine;   European Travel.       239 And hills, all rich with blossomed trees, And fields which promise corn and wine, And scattered cities crowning these, Whose far, white walls along them shine, Have strewed a scene which I should see With double joy wert thou with me." And Ruth responded,- "And I will see these banks of Rhine,  My brother, with thy hand in mine." "Hardly fair to alter the poet's lines," said Jacob, with a slight shadow on his face and a searching look at Ruth which brought the blushes to her cheeks. "Jacob," she said, suddenly, as if turning back to the former subject, "  Jacob, I shall never dare call myself a Christian if the name confers such an awful responsibility." "Ah, Ruth, it is better to try to walk in the right path than to turn from it altogether. I am not always so oppressed as I have been for the last few months. When one sees so much to be done, and knows not where to commence his work, he is disturbed and overwhelmed.    The  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7484-00000124"/> 240        My Hero. greatness of the task and his own strength are so ill proportioned, that he feels like Archimedes without his lever. But when one has chosen his life-work, and has definite aims and purposes, then come hope and cheerfulness. I spent yester- day two thousand feet below the surface of the earth. To - day, we will pass some hours on the summit of the Drachenfels, where we can see far down the Rhine,- a scene full of beauty. You will have a peep at old Cologne, twenty miles away, and a ruined castle where a 1Brave knight shut himself up for life, because his promised  bride, having heard a false report of his death in the army, took the veil and became dead to the world." "But when she heard he was living, why did she not come out?" "Her vow of celibacy was for life." "Dame Rumor cheated her with false pre- tenses. She acted in the dark.  Such a vow was not binding."   European Travel.      241 "It was hard, I am willing to confess, but per- haps"-- "No perhaps in the case," said Ruth, who was always quite warm in defense of her own side of the question. "Then you would have escaped,--scaled the walls, bribed a servant, or fought your way through ranks of nuns headed by the black - robed Lady Superior," said Jacob. "Yes, if"- Aye, no if's, Ruth, if you will not allow me a perhaps. If what?" "If I were only sure of his love." The words came out quick and sharp, and if Jacob could have seen under the cottage straw bonnet, which was the fashion at that time, he would have seen a crimson cheek and bright eyes. "For my part, I only wonder that he did n't scale the convent walls, or make friends with some old cowlcd professor, or bring an army of  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7484-00000125"/> 242        My Hero. followers and threaten to tear down the walls with battering rams, as was the custom in those days." If he had," said Ruth, "Schiller would never have given us the pathetic ballad of the Kinight of Toggenberg.   All through  a long life he lived alone,- ' Where Is castle-crowned hight Frowns the valley down, Dwelt unknown the hermit knight, In a sackcloth gown. ' "There is the castle of Rolandseck," said Jacob, as they stood on the top of Drachenfels that day, "and yonder are the ruins of the con- vent where he could get a passing glance of the. nun's form  across the lattice bar. When he died, his face was still turned thither,- ' With the look where life was not Towards the casement cast.' The saddest part of the ballad is not that tell- ing of his death, but the words,r- Knight, a sister's quiet love Gives my heart to thee,   European Travel.      243 Ask me not for other love, For it painethme.' ' Ruth made no answer.  Her father, who had been viewing the Rhine from different positions on the mountain, now came towards them. "After all, Jacob, our times are an improve- ment on that old feudal age, of which these ru- ined castles are about all that remain, when men were owned like cattle, and subject to the will of a tyrannical knight, who believed his serfs were born to serve him. As good old Bishop Porteus says,-' Christianity, though not so well understood or honestly practiced as it ought to be, has communicated its kindly influence to the world. It has restrained the spirit of the prince and/the madness of the people. It has softened the rigor of despotism, and tamed the insolence of conquest. Throughout Christendom there pre- vails a gentleness of manners, widely different from the ferocity of the most civilized nations of antiquity.'"  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7484-00000126"/> 244       My Hero.  Thank you," said Jacob;" those words of the good old Bishop are refreshing to - day. We need now and then to look on the bright side." "Like our Ruth, who I believe never sees any other." "God grant she never may," said Jacob, who felt at that moment, as he. looked upon the fair woman at his side, that he would gladly hide from her sight all the sordid misery, the guilt and wretchedness which met his eyes daily. "I can hardly agree with you, Jacob; if this world is the beginning and end, as our respected friend, Richard Armstrong, believes, then we may well try to guard Ruth from pain and make her life a sunny holiday; but my daughter may meet sorrow and work in this world, and I would 'have her strong and patient to endure. God make her an earnest and true Christian, is my prayer, like your mother and grandmother." Tears sprang to Ruth's eyes) as she took her father's hand and said,-   European Travel.      245 "Amen, Father; I hope your prayer will be answered." Jacob made no reply, but there was a glow of admiration in his dark eyes, as he looked at Ruth an instant and then turned away, as if to see farther beyond the great rocks which shut out the view northward. This tour on the continent was something to be remembered and talked over all their future lives; and there came a time in Ruth's life when that prayer of her father, uttered on the top of Drach- enfels, came to her, and she knew it to be a prophecy. But her serious moods never lasted long. When they tarried for awhile in the beautiful city of Florence, she was like one on enchanted ground.  The palaces and . old churches afforded her great pleasure, and she went again and again to see Michael Angelo's statues of Night and Day, Twilight and Dawn, each time with increasing admiration, while the collection of pictures in the Grand Duke's palace  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7484-00000127"/> 246       My Hero. filled her to the very brim with admiration and wonder. "I tell you, Father, what we will do," she said one day, when they returned to their hotel from one of their numerous visits to these pic- tures. "We will go home, when our present journey is over, rest awhile, and then return to the continent and begin where we leave off, putting a mark in, as we do when reading a book." Her father smiled. "Ruth, my darling, I am curious to see how you will feel when we leave Paris again." To Paris they came at last, and here Ruth was indeed bewildered, during her short sojourn of a month; and what between pictures and shawls, operas, statues, fountains, palaces, laces, silks and flowers, she was in a maze of delight. She saw less of Jacob than during other parts 'of the journey. He always took dinner with them, and often looked pale and weary. Ruth   European Travel.      247 had yet to learn that, where there is most splendor and gayety in the world, there ignorance and poverty do most abound. The serpent is beneath the flowers, the palace hides the dungeon; the hospital, with its marble fronts and massive pil- lars, is dumb, and tells no tale of the suffering it conceals. Jacob, too, was reticent. He could not mar the pleasure of Ruth. He would not be the skeleton at the feast. "Only four weeks, Papa, in this beautiful city, the most beautiful of all cities I Ugh how- can we ever live in dingy London again, where the sunlight never penetrates the smoke?  It makes me feel like, -like as I fancy a chimney - sweep may. No, no, Papa, let us stay all winter here." "And let Jacob travel alone to Liverpool? You know he returns there before he leaves for the United States, and he takes his departure in one- week after our return to London."  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7484-00000128"/> 248       Mly Hef'o. "O Jacob, I had forgotten. We have been so happy here, and the time has passed so rap- idly that I have not thought about your going back to your old home. It seems so strange, Jacob, to call any other place home, than our house in Manchester Square." I wonder, Ruth," said Jacob, with a slight twinkle of mirth in his eyes, as he glanced around the elegant apartment in which they sat, and at Ruth's rich dress, "I wonder if you would enjoy a month's visit at the old Stirling Farm." Ruth started; the quick color came to her cheeks and the tears to her eyes. ' O Jacob, I love the very stones of the old fences. Happy on the old farm with Aunt Susan and dear, old Grandma? It would be more delightful than all Paris, though the operas are splendid and every- thing is so beautiful, but better, far better the  love of the dear old friends on the farm." It was Jacob's turn now to feel such a sudden throb at his heart that he could -not trust himself   European Travel.      249 to speak, but there was an expression of more than mere admiration as he looked at Ruth. "Sweet and sound of heart still," he said to him- self. Time passed so rapidly, and there was so much to enjoy, that no day was long enough for our three travelers; but Jacob had made his appoint- ment to be in Liverpool on a certain day, -and the steamer in' which he was to embark for the United States was advertised to sail on the third from that date. Mr. Johns and his daughter remained with him till his departure, and Ruth's last words were, - "Tell them all that Papa and I will visit them next year." A voyage across the Atlantic has little novelty for the reader now- a- days; and we will not lengthen our story by any description of Jacob's, but land him at once, after a swift trans- port by steam, at New York. He had been absent from his native country so long that he  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7484-00000129"/> 250       My Hero. felt himself more of .a stranger in New York than in London or Liverpool. He stepped on shore, 4 and was making his way through the crowd, when his attention was attracted by a tall, hand- some young man, dressed in the hight of fashion, who seemed like one having authority. He wore his hat in a jaunty way; his mustache was dressed a la mode, and he wore a large diamond in his shirt bosom, which Jacob knew at a glance to be genuine and of great value. The stranger stopped as Jacob walked up to a coach. He was giving some directions to the driver, when the stranger, after looking at him attentively for an instant, touched him on the shoulder, and said, -"Jacob Stirling! as sure  as I am alive! I waited a moment till you spoke, that 1 might hear your voice, and then I knew you for certain." Jacob turned and looked at the speaker in as- tonishment. What acquaintance)had he in New York, that could afford to wear a three thousand   European Travel.     251 dollar breastpin, and a watch-chain of solid gold, heavy enough to tie up Silvertail junior in his stall? "You have the advantage of me, Sir," said Jacob, gravely. "But I know you, Jacob, though you have become one of the world's people, I see, and have forgotten 'thee' and 'thou.' But I hope you are not going to cut your old friends because you have been so long in old England. That would be too bad, be jabers." "Dick Barnard!" said Jacob, his eyes bright- ening and his heart warming at the sight of a playmate of his childhood. "Indeed, Dick; you must excuse me, but you have. altered. It seems time has not changed my boyish looks as much." "No, Jake, the addition of whiskers even has not altered you much, for you wear 'the same expression that you did when we went to school together in the old red school- house, where you were always near the head and I at the foot of  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7484-00000130"/> 252       My Hero. the spelling class. We took those extreme places very naturally." "You are not at the foot in money making, I fancy," said Jacob. "You are right there. By the way, what are you doing with this dirty hack?" "I am going to a hotel for the night," said Jacob, "and was directing this man to find my luggage." "You can't get it for two hours at least. Let the fellow go, and I will see that your trunks are all right." He then motioned to the driver of a very handsome carriage, near by, who drove towards them. "You must be my guest to-night, Jake, and we will talk over old times. I returned from home yesterday, and can give you the latest news. Here, Jim, drive us home, and then return for the gentleman's trunks." Jacob was too happy, to be Welcomed thus on his return, to refuse Dick's invitation, and he took   European Travel.      253 the offered seat in the carriage, drawn by a pair of horses that seemed to attract the admiration of all on the street. They drove rapidly up Broadway, stopping at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. "Come right up into my rooms, Jacob," said Dick; "I will make you feel at home in no time." Dick's rooms were richly furnished, and were as fine and comfortable bachelor quarters as could be found in the city. "There, now," said he to Jacob, as he rolled an easy chair towards 'him, a great "Sleepy Hollow," cushioned and draped in yellow damask; "make yourself at home, and rest while I order dinner. Will you take a glass of wine?" "Not any, I thank you," said Jacob. "Take a smoke? Good Havanas on the shelf." "Never smoked a cigar in my life, Dick." "Suppose so," said Dick, with the same im- perturbable good humor which never failed him.  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7484-00000131"/> 254        My Hero. "You do keep the 'thees' and 'thous' in your heart if not on your tongue." "Yes; I suppose you remember the dislike of the old folks at home to tobacco." Yes; never dared chew when I went to your house. But I left that off long ago; it will hardly do in good society; but I smoke. Why, Jake, I import my own cigars; even then they cost me five hundred a year." "Why, Dick, you must have made a great deal of money since you came to New York." "Easy enough to do that, Jacob. Ever since I bought Auntie Dole's 'horns of plenty' for two cents apiece and sold 'em for ten, I have prac- ticed buying cheap and selling dear. I worked hard for two years. It is the first five thousand that costs. After that, if a fellow has his eye teeth cut and his eyes open, he can make money here. I have done well by the rise of lots in the upper part of the city, and low I am investing in stocks of various sorts. Certain railroads are   European Travel.      255 in the market now. Stock low, no dividends, directorsoslow and stupid. I am biding my time, watching and waiting for the best chance. You will see what will come of it. But dinner is ready. I think you will enjoy your first meal on land." The dinner, like all Dick's surroundings, was ostentatious, offering a display of French dishes, and served by waiters who understood well that Barnard was getting rich. "I thought Miss Ruth was to return with you," said Dick as he sipped his glass'of wine at the dessert. "No, she comes on next year to visit her old friends at the farm," said Jacob. "-Beautiful as ever, I suppose." "Yes, far more so, Dick. Miss Ruth is called beautiful in England, where the beauty of health is more abundant than in this country. I have a portrait of her, painted on ivory, which hardly does her justice."  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7484-00000132"/> 256       My Hero.  He took it out to show it to Dick, who retained it while they remained in the dining-room, and still held it in his hand when they withdrew to Dick's rooms. "She is a beauty i" he exclaimed repeatedly as he kept gazing upon it.  "She has the same saucy bright eyes as of old. She was full of fun in the old times, Jacob." "And is now, Dick.  Ruth has found life, thus far, only a holiday; and yet she is as un- selfish and as unspoiled'as when she used to give all her dinner at school to the poor little Jones's who always looked so forlorn and hungry." "I used to think she gave it to them for the pleasure of seeing little Job gobble it down, stuff-  ing it into his big mouth with both hands. Do you remember, Jacob, that I told her I would go to England in my own ship to visit her?" "In your steamer, was it not? She says you are coming in your steamer to bring her back." "Yes, in my steamer.  Does she remember   European Travel.      257 it? Well, and I mean to do it without fail, Jacob!" "Judging from the past, I should not be sur- prised, Dick, at such an event," said Jacob. ' Why, Jake, the thing is all but accomplished now. We are having 'a new line of steamers started from this city to Liverpool, and I have already taken stock. In six months I shall be on my way; and if Miss Ruth will take passage, she shall come back like a queen." "I think that will please her, Dick. She likes beautiful things." "Does she?" said Dick, with an expression of surprise and pleasure in his voice. "You would think so if you had seen her drafts on her father's purse in Paris. . She divided her admiration between pictures and cashmere shawls and laces. Her father bargained for the first, and she for tie last two articles, and her bills were almost as large as his." "I warrant; hope she did n't get cheated. It  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7484-00000133"/> 258        My Hero. takes a practiced eye in them things, Dick; but they can't cheat me. I know a real cashmere and camel's hair as far as I can see it. Now I bet a fifty you don't know a Paisley from a Camel's hair." "I must confess ignorance," said Jacob. "And so Miss Ruth likes shawls, and laces, and beautiful things," lie repeated, as if, talking to himself, while looking at the picture which still lay before him, a curious expression creep- ing over his face, which Jacob was slow to in- terpret.    CHAPTER VIII 1N THE LEHII   VALLEY. ROM  the time when Jacob Stir- ling received the letter from Mr. Johns, giving them an account of Jacob's suc- cess in the university and  his high standing in his class, they had waited with great outward patience, but with warm, loving hearts, for his return. The quiet garb which gave such an air of serenity to the mother, Susan Stirling, hid many longings and motherly fears.  When the steamer became due in New York, her eyes  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7484-00000134"/> 260        My Hero. were turned many times an hour to the road, running to the town. As for Grandma Stirling, she had found, for some days, the light from that window altogether best for her knitting, and her husband, who was now a man of leisure, as his eighty years might warrant, found it for his health and convenience to ride to town every morning. Indeed, he couldn't help himself, he said, for "Daughter Susan" gave hinl some com- mission every day to execute in town. The old gentleman was getting childish perhaps; but it was evident that he wanted the first sight of the boy, and the family desired to gratify him. He had his wish, and Jacob Stirling, 2nd, the father,  was quite as happy as if he had brought his son himself, when he saw that stalwart, noble look- ing young man, side by side with his venerable father, whose snow-white locks flowed beneath the broad- brimmed hat, and whose full, fair face wore a look of charming contentment. The mother's heart was full when she saw that   In the Lehigh Valley.    261 Jacob's eyes filled with tears, and that he was the same gentle child as of old, strong and manly, but her boy still,--just as near to her heart as in the days of his boyhood. No collegiate train- ing, no foreign travel, no polished society had weaned Jacob from his love for the old farm and the neighborhood. In two days he had seen all the neighbors, had called on Dick's mother in her new, stylish house, and on old Aunt Beck, poor and bed ridden, had chatted for an hour in Auntie Dole's shop, where there was a knot collected to see him, and had visited Oakwood, where he met again the " pretty lady" with whom he parted on the beach years before. She had ripened into a beautiful young matron, and Jacob felt that Mr. Armstrong might well bless the wave that came so near hurrying Mary Mudie to an ocean tomb. But Richard Armstrong had no faith in special providences,--or general, either, for he pursued his studies with his former earnest- ness, and the same one -sided view of the uni-  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7484-00000135"/> 262       My Hero. verse; but the reticence and the gloom had in a measure passed away. He welcomed Jacob as a co- student, and they talked and argued and studied, every day finding them much' together, Mr. Armstrong surprised to learn" that in argument Jacob was a foeman worthy of his steel. A few weeks -were passed at home among the haunts of his childhood, and then the neighbors, as Yankee neighbors always will, began to ask among themselves, what Jacob was going to do in the world. "Will he be a minister?" asked one. "He is well-fitted for that profession," was replied. Others said, "If you could hear him talk with Mr. Armstrong, you'd say he ought to be a lawyer." "He hain't no need of bein' nothin' but a gentleman," said Aunt Beck, who, being the poorest person in the village, had the greatest admiration for wealthy idleness. "The Stirlings have money," sle said, " and Mr. Johns is a nabob, (her word for a very rich   In the Lehigh Valley.    263 man,) and calls him his child, so the young man hain't no need to work all his life." And she lay on her bed in helpless poverty, and thought what a grand thing a life of leisure would be to one who had plenty of money.  The old lady was right in one respect. Jacob was a child of fortune, surely. He could com- mand a life of ease, but a pleasant career was opened for him by one of the scientific men of England, who wished him as an assistant in his particular branches of study. "It .is a fine opening," wrote Mr. Johns, " and will no doubt lead you to preferment and distinction in those pursuits which are so attractive to you." Jacob was almost persuaded, but he took counsel only of his own heart, and was cautious in all his conversation, but often held communion with his mother, whose spirit was wholly in ac- cord with his in what should constitute the great aim of a Christian life, whatever its individual pursuit or profession. "However quixotic nay  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7484-00000136"/> 264        My Hero. life may appear to others, my mother will under- stand me." was his frequent thought, and it proved his consolation. From the time he visited the Staffordshire miners, where he found a large, ignorant, vicious population, he had' resolved to return there and spend a part of his life in trying to elevate and Christianize them. ' Our Saviour came and laid his hands on the sick; he entered into the houses of the publicans; he turned not away from the outcasts, but gently said to them, "Sin no more." He had found other classes of toilers whose lives were shortened that the rich might be provided with luxuries; but none where men worked in such large masses,- none whose labor and habits he sol well understood. -He " dared not tell his plan to his friends, for he knew the disappointment it would cause them. There was a greater struggle still in his heart,--an utter banishment of a hope that had made life look so bright before him. )Ruth was to him, not a perfect ideal. She was no " perfect woman, d   In the Lehigh Valley.     265 nobly planned," &amp;c., but he loved her as he was sure he could love no other woman. He knew her faults, but beneath them all, he understood full well, there was a warm, generous heart that a life of ease and luxury had failed-to spoil. She seemed a part of his life, his other self. Only of late had he realized that the freedom of their childhood was over, and that she was admired and sought by many men more polished and ac- complished than himself. He feared to mar the friendship of brother. and sister which existed between them by any revelation of his feelings, till he had some evidence that they were recipro- cated.  There was no barrier on the father's side, for Mr. Johns had said,- ' Jacob, if you and Ruth should ever marry, to which, remember, I have no objection,-. but on this subject I leave you free,-yet if such an event should occur, it will make little difference with regard to property. I shall leave one - alf of my fortune to you, whoever you may choose for *  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7484-00000137"/> 266        My Hero. your wife. I shall never forget the day when your grandfather Stirling brought me to his home, a poor, forlorn little waif as ever the waves flung on shore. I owe him a debt which I can never repay." But the idea of taking Ruth to share the life which seemed destined for him, was too absurd to harbor for a moment.  The husband of Ruth must be a man who could command the luxuries and refinements of life. She loved the pleasures of this world and all that makes life bright and beautiful. She must not be brought in contact with suffering and vice. The great longing of his heart, the constraint which was upon him, or., as St. Paul expresses it, -"It is given me not only to believe in Christ, but to suffer for him," could not be suppressed. How Richard Armstrong would smile if he knew what was in Jacob's heart, and shake his finely shaped head and say,- " all a delusion);" and even Mr. Johns would look sad, and say, "a pity that   In the Lehigh Valley.    267 Jacob should spend his life in doing what any il- literate good man might do;" and Dick Barnard, in his elegant rooms, driving his fast horses, the admiration of the gaping crowd, would find a problem that all his mathematical skill could not solve. Money was the object of life. What could give more satisfaction? He enjoyed it more every day, as was really the case. Dick was of a happy temperament, and he rode or walked down Broadway with a feeling of self - conscious- ness and delight amusing to behold. But though Jacob knew all this, he could not resist the im- pulse to spend his life as he believed Christ taught his followers, by precept and example. Mean- while, he devoted a part of his time to the study of surgery, a knowledge of which he deemed essential to the accomplishment of his work. He had been at his father's house about three months, when he resolved to know more of his own country before returning to England, and in accordance with this determination, he found him  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7484-00000138"/> 268       My Hero, self one day in a vild gorge among the mount- ains of Pennsylvania. The scenery was wild and romantic, more picturesque than any which he had ever before met in all his wanderings. A little river, arrested in its course by dams, canal locks and rocks, foams and frets on its way through the defile, and the scream of steam whistles, the rumbling of innumerable trains of cars, and the shouts of boatmen make up a cho- rus of noises, day and night, altogether unus- ual. The town is wedged in by the hills, and consists of only one long, narrow street; all the rest of the space is taken up by the walled river, the canal, railroad, street and line of houses. No place in the world perhaps is surrounded with so much to interest one who likes to study the wonderful anthracite coal beds which the foresight of a wise Providence has laid down for the use of man. Far up the side of the mountains, and even their very tops, all are aive with long trains of coal cars. They shoot along like huge ser-   In the Lehigh Valley.     269 pents, winding among rocks and trees, and by deep chasms and over trestle-work supports, carrying their heavy loads of black diamonds to the waiting cars and boats below. He ascended one of the mountains by. steam, thirteen hundred feet, and then, taking a railroad, some twenty- five miles in extent, built pur- posely for the accommodation of the coal traffic, he was carried upon the tops and sides of mount- ain ranges, descending at last into a valley where many coal mines are worked. It is shut out from all the rest of the world, with its population of miners. The massive coal - breakers, I machines for breaking great masses of coal, are upon the right and left; and dark, yawning pits, the entrances to the subterranean passages traversed by the coal diggers, are seen in every direction. Mount- ains of coal dust, the refuse of the breakers, project into the valley and give a somber hue to everything. Even the leaves upon the trees be  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7484-00000139"/> 270        My Hero. come darkened by the coal dust, and black, tur- bid streams wind among the rocks, seeming anxious to escape from the dingy caverns in which they rise. All along, as he traversed the wild gorges of the mountains, he found every inch of ground resting upon coal. It crops out of thP hills, and the whole industry of the country is coal mining. Jacob found here, as in England, aristocracy among the miners, caused by a divis- ion of labor; the little boys, who begin by pick- ing out the slate when the coal is screened, look forward to the time when they shall become don- key boys qnd drive the coal cars, then they as- cend to loaders, and finally become full miners. They care little for books. Jacob found a regi- ment of troops quartered in the district, as he was told such force was sometimes necessary to preserve order. In this coal district thirty thou- sand miners dwell.  Thirty thousand people, either in the mines or near tlem, working in the various ways, necessary to furnish the great coal   In the L^hiqh  Valley.   271 markets of our cities, and to keep the machinery of our country in operation. Jacob found a field, not white for the harvest surely, but black with the grime of labor and the darkness of vice and ignorance. There was a ground swell of murmur against the more fortu- nate classes of society, a bitterness and strife between capital and labor which seemed ominous of evil for the future. Into this question ae did not enter; political questions, full of gravity to be sure, were ignored by him. But he found that this vast amount of hoarded wealth, that could only be made available by the labor of the miners, was in the hands of a few capitalists. Could he but lead both parties to see that mutual interest required great forbear- ance on one side, and generous provision on the other, for thb safety, health and improvement of the laborer, he would do a good work. On the other hand, his knowledge of mining taught him that many improvements might be introduced.  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7484-00000140"/> 272        My Hero. He saw too clearly that miners were looked upon only as animals who would bring their masters a certain amount of gain, and the laborers them- selves viewed with distrust any one who should come with the design simply of benefiting them. He therefore took the position of an engineer and surveyor, something which would bring him in contact with the miners, and by means of which he could influence them. He hired a small house, taking his meals with the family of a miner whose  habits seemed cleanly, but preserved the freedom of his own  home that he might welcome the smallest child, if he wished, to his hospitality. Now Jacob's life began in earnest, and he was soon -so busy that he wished sleep was not necessary for restor ing the energies of the body. He lived wholly among those to whom he ministered. He made no boast of his object. He dressed, lived and walked among them as belonging to their class. He understood all their terms when he came,   In the Lehigh Valley.    273 could talk German with those who spoke that language; and could make himself tolerably well understood even by the Welsh who were the most clannish and difficult to reach. He joined in their sports and often won their admiration by his feats of muscular strength. The influence of a good man, whose aim in life is to live on a high plane and draw others to him, is felt in society everywhere;, but here in this secluded valley, shut off by the peculiar employment of its inhabitants, men, women and children, whose daily labor is the veriest drudg- ery, uncheered by sunlight and with only a mod- icum of pure air,-such a  man as Jacob Stirling became a sort of wonder among them. His house was well furnished with elementary books on scientific subjects, and he purchased some chemical and philosophical apparatus with which he first amused and then instructed them. He always had a kind word for those in sorrow, and was very gentle to the erring. He took a  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7484-00000141"/> 274        My Hero. great interest in the children, using all his in- fluence to keep thein out of the mines till the age prescribed by law. This was one of his most difficult tasks, for the cupidity of parents induced them to falsify, and the boys themselves were always eager, - strange as it may seem, -to begin work. To the vicious, profane young man, Jacob came, not with reproof, but with an invitation to his rooms, where he would try to make him forget his appetite for drink in amusement, with per- chance a cup of coffee to satisfy that thirst which a morbid taste had engendered. Gradually he became known to a large number of workmen, who gave him the name of"Boss Stirling.'2 "dunno nothin' what it means," said one woman who had just buried two little children. 'Boss Stirling ain't no priest nor minister, but when my baby died, and I felt angry with God for taking it from me, he came and read to me such Bible verses as comforted me, and he prayed,   In the Lehigh Valley.     275 too, till I almost saw my little ones in the arms of the Saviour, and I did n't weep no more." ( Come, Jim," said a sooty miner just from the shaft, to his friend, "come, let us go to Boss Stirling's room to - night and see them pictures of the big cities over the sea. That whiskey down to Jack's groggery set my head afire last night, and Boss Stirling says it burns a fellow's stomach worse than any pison. He knows, you see, 'cause he's studied to be a doctor. Did you see him set Jack Strawn's arm?  Jack broke it a fightin'. I knowed so, 'cause, ye see, I was thar, but Jack he stuck to it that it was done by a great lump of coal fallin' on him. Boss Stirling never let on that he knowed 'twas a lie, but he set the arm, just as slick as I could splice a rope, and when he put it in the sling, he said,-' Now, Jack, take care of that lump of coal, because it has got arms andlegs.' At that Jack burst out laffin' and said, says he, Boss, its no use lyin' to ye; you can see right through a fellow. As true as  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7484-00000142"/> 276       My Hero. 1 live, I'll never tell another lie, and I'll quit fightin'." There came a change, very slow, hardly per- ceptible for. many months, but a great change for the better in the community where Jacob's influ- ence was felt. There was more intelligence, more cleanliness, and the mine was better worked.  He introduced many little improve- ments, but hefound his power for good greatly fettered by the infraction of laws, by the indif- ference of the laborers themselves, and by the cupidity of the owners, who threw all responsi- bility upon their agents, and would not employ sufficient capital to insure the safety of the work- men. If they do n't care for their lives, why should we trouble ourselves?" said one owner who came from curiosity to visit his property. "They come in crowds, begging for work, and never ask for improvements. The truth is, they are a miserable set of creatures, not equal to my   In the Lehigh Valley.     2" horses, which prize care and repay kindness with good and steady service." "Not near as well housed and fed, I fancy, Sir," said Jacob. "Perhaps not," said the man, as he cast his eye upon.the shanties ,and small dingy houses near, and thought of his marble stable in the upper part of the city. He rode on, but Jacob heard him  say,-"Plaguy smart fellow that; knows a deal about his business; knows too much, in fact,. for us. We do n't want men that know too much." Jacob had lived at the mines about eight months, and so busy had been his life that it appeared to him but a few weeks, when, hloping to influence some of the proprietors of that mine to put in better machinery for ventilation, he went to New York to present the matter in person. He turned from his humble home with a feel- ing of regret that he must leave it at all, for not  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7484-00000143"/> 278        My lHer o. one day came without bringing with it some work to do for the sick in body or mind. His rooms, though plain, were inviting to the eye by their cleanliness; a few well-selected engravings, a small library, and, besides his apparatus, there were stereoscopes, a good microscope, and a small telescope, which gave to the wondering eyes of many of the young miners a view of the valleys and hills on the moon. There was no carpet, no upholstered furniture, no lace curtain, no rare china. All Jacob's income was devoted to the improvement and comfort of those to whom he had come to minister; yet not one knew of or appreciated the heroism of his daily life. As for himself, each day brought its own reward, till he felt that he dared not say he bore a cross. But, just in proportion as he traveled from his labor, he lost courage. He was aware of the grasp with which avarice holds' the moneyed men in our cities, and when hb proposed the im- proved methods of mining which science has in.   In the Lehigh Valley.     279 vented for the safety of those who toil in the dark, foul depths of the earth that we may have light and warmth, he was met by a shrug of the shoulders, complaint of scarcity of money, small percentage, the abundance of labor, and the indifference of the laborers themselves who vio- lated every law made for their protection. "I see you don't ask any increase of wages for them," said one capitalist, as he sat in his well - appointed, gas- lighted and coal - warmed office in Wall Street. "No," said Jacob. "I ask, first of all, that every working mine in the Lehigh valley should be so ventilated by air passages that there can be po possibility of death in the mine by impure air, and that our superintendents shall be men chosen for their thorough knowledge, men educated for their work. More, Sir; I do ask that the few owners of these coal - beds should remember that they are responsible in a great measure for the health and safety of thirty thousand laborers. I  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7484-00000144"/> 280       lMy Hero. would settle the difficulty which seems now to be increasing, between capital and labor, by rousing a spirit of mutual interest. Come to your works, -ascend and descend the shafts, - spend a few hours with them in their toil, -see how they live. Give them to understand that, if they have suffered in your adversity, they shall share in your prosperity." The proprietor shook his head. "All this sounds well, Mr. Stirling; pretty theory, comes out once in a while in the papers; but I know enough of these miners to be sure that they are brutal, ignorant men that care little for human life. My partner is an owner of coal mines in Illinois. He imported two thousand Welshmen to work them, free passages, and wages guarantied for a year. They worked three months and struck for higher wages. There they are now, roaming the streets like wild beasts; not a woman or child dares stir out after dark, nor a inan unless doubly armed. The agent was robbed and murdered   In the Lehigh Valley.    281 only yesterday, as we learn by telegraph. And see what we have fromn our district this morning," -turning to a little table near a telegraphic machine which connected his own office with one of the main lines. "Good deal of disturbance to - day; men threaten to stop work; Jack Baron, best miner in the' Broad,' is haranguing men and doing mis- chief." Jacob knew  him as one of the most reliable workmen, but hasty and easily led by designing men. "Now, Sir," said the proprieter, "we must put this thing down. We will double the military force if necessary. These workmen are not to be our dictators. As for the improvements you ask,- why, of course we want our mine safe, but they cost money, Sir, and money is n't quite so plenty as you seem  to think. Coal is low, Sir, at present. We must raise the price if we make extensive improvements, and then the people will ^  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7484-00000145"/> 282       My Hero. grumble, and call us oppressers of the poor." Jacob had no time to waste on those whom he could not convince, and he bade the gentleman good morning, and directed his steps to the house of a clergyman whom he had met in Europe, and 'who was well known for his enlarged views and his philanthropy. He was ushered into a noble suite of rooms, or rather an arched parlor, fur- nished with exquisite taste. The carpets were soft as moss, and of quiet, chaste designs, the neutral -tinted wall was hung with a few choice paintings and some rare engravings; flowers per- fumed the room, real lace curtains shaded the windows, and everything, even the cornice around the walls, was in good taste,--a grape vine, accurately molded from nature. Portfolios of pictures of great size lay open on rests provided for them, with easy chairs at hand. Shaded lamps on the side of the room threw a soft light over all; and when Jacob had sent his card to the master of the house, he sat down to rest a   AIl the Lehigkh Valley. ,  283 moment in this spot, soothing to his ruffled spirit by its air of refinement and taste. His eye fell on an admirable copy of Paul Potter's picture,- "Orpheus charming the Beasts," and he was standing, looking at it, recalling the time when he stood with Ruth in the Trippenhuis gallery in Amsterdam, looking at the original. He was absorbed in the recollection of those happy days and heard no one enter, when sud- denly a voice, close to his ear, said, -"I sup- pose you are familiar with the original, Mr. Stirling." Jacob turned and met the broad, happy face of the clergyman, beaming with health and good iature, who gave him a most cordial shake of the hand. "I am delighted to see you, Mr.. Stirling. I have wished for an interview with you; was up in the mines only a few weeks after you settled down there, but you were away that day making some surveys on the other side of Mount Pisgah,  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7484-00000146"/> 284  M-      y Hero. - a queer name that for a mountain that over- looks only vast beds of coal. The Girgashites and Ammonites and Moabites are not leaving the land, but taking possession; for I perceived Welsh, Germans, Irish, Swedes, and all tongues and people at work there. I thought of you this morning when I looked at that picture before which you stand, --'Taming the wild beasts.' That seems to be your gift." Jacob wondered how the clergyman should know so much of him, when the latter, who seemed to read his thought, said, - "Mr. Stirling, I returned from Europe only day before yesterday, in the Steamship Arion. Mr Johns and his daughter were fellow passengers, as was also a young man, well known in this city for the rapidity with which he has made a fortune. He is one of the owners of the ship, and you can well imagine that your beautiful cousin- was surrounded with all the appointments of a queen. That she had not sails of purple silk, and a   In the Lehigh Valley.    285 canopy of gold, with Cupids and Graces around her, was because modern modes of travel do not permit it; but everything whic' gold could com- mand was at her service to make the voyage delightful. Is this to be another of those diamond weddings which shock the taste, and desecrate marriage by making it like a broker's contract?" "God forbid!" just trembled on Jacob's lips, but the words were checked ere they .fell, and he replied quietly, "I have not seen my friends for a year,. Sir, and am ignorant of their plans." "You will find Mr. Johns and his daughter at the Clarendon, where they remain till to - morrow. You have probably missed letters and telegrams by your absence." "I shall hope to see them soon; but, first, let me tell you my errand to the city." Jacob found that the clergyman had investigated his subject, and that his warm heart and eloquent tongue  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7484-00000147"/> 286        My Hero. were enlisted on his side. He had found one man who understood and appreciated his task. There was no need of words to convince the preacher that we have in our midst a population as imflammable as the materials they work; that there is an open field for Christian enterprise and labor among them. The strong man, strong in spirit and in body, walked back and forth in his elegant rooms, 'and said,- "Jacob Stirling! I like to call you by that name, spoken so often by my friend Johns) when  I think of your work, the simplicity of your life, and the sacrifice which you have made, I am filled with shame. I mean to be a workman, and strike good blows for my Master Builder; but sometimes when I enter my home, it is lovely and pleasant unto me; be sure, but not much like the house of Saint Paul when he preached in Rome or dwelt in the most) polished cities of Greece. Skeptics doubt the power of Chris-   In the Lehigh Valley.    287 tianity. But it seems to me that Christians work as the miners did twenty years ago,- dig a little hole in a coal hill, and then peck away, drawing the surface coal out with a hand - barrow. It is only when they work with steam  engine and gunpowder that they level the mountains and thus give light and warmth to the world. Help you? Yes, if the power of words be given to me, I will make these men, who hold the lives of these ignorant miners in their hands, ashamed of that short - sighted policy which, for the sake of one per cent. more, will leave a mine unventi- lated, or refuse improvements which will drain and light those subterranean caves."  Jacob's heart was cheered as he took his way to the Clarendon, where he found his friends ex- pecting him. They had not been out, lest they should miss his call, not doubting that their telegram had reached him. Jacob found no lack of cordiality in Mr. Johns's reception; he had feared his disapproval *s   &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7484-00000148"/> 288       My fI-ero. of his course, but none such was expressed, and Ruth's manner was as warm, playful, sisterly, as of old. She was in haste to go home, as she called Stirling Farm. "Why, Jacob, we thought you-would be here, yesterday!" she said; and when you didn't come, I proposed to Papa to go right to those horrid coal mines and find you. I dared not go myself, or could not, for it would be necessary to buy a whole black traveling suit to travel in; and black is not becoming to me, you know. But, now you are here, let us not lose a minute; please order a carriage and we will go to the depot at once. There is a train starts at two o'clock. If anything should happen to dear old Grandpa before I get there, I should mourn all my days. He is almost ninety years old, and he said in his last letter,--' Thee must coine soon, Ruthie, for my days are numbered.'" Home again once more! ) The circle unbroken that had gathered in the spacious dining--room   In the Lehigh Vgalley.    289 long years ago. Robert Johns, now fifty years of age, felt himself a boy again as Grandpa Stir- ling laid his hand upon his head and said, - "'Lord, let now thy servant depart in peace,' for once more I see my children together." As for Grandma, she had to give up her spec- tacles altogether for the tears which dimmed the glass. "I used sometimes to wonder, Robert," she said, "which loved best, thee or Jacob. Thee was quicker'in thy temper, but thee had a warm heart, and then thee was motherless." "Never after I entered this house," said Mr. Johns. )Aunt Susan could hardly believe it possible that the tall, elegant lady before her was the little Ruth who used to be so heedless and frolic- some. Time had wrought wonderfully here. O Auntie," said Ruth,  I tried hard' to re- member all your nice ways, to shake the dust from every garment before folding and putting it  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7484-00000149"/> 290        My Hero. away, and I made a great effort to keep all my drawers and boxes in the way you taught; but, Auntie dear, it is n't in me as it is in Jacob; he was born in the kingdom of neatness. There, now, he is this very minute folding my veil, which must have fallen on the floor when I came in. And how are all the good folks, Auntie Susan? I am: going down to Aunite Dole's as soon as I have eaten breakfast in the morning, to buy some gibralters- and a horn of plenty." cI fear thee will not find them, darling," said Aunt Susan. ( Auntie Dole is helpless with the rheumatism, and does not make things for her shop as formerly; but it will do her good to see thee." "It will do me good to see her, Auntie. I must show you a sketch which I made of her from memory, turban, gold beads, short gown, high- heeled shoes and all; but I couldn't remember whether her turban was red and green plaid silk, or blue and green."   In the Lehigh Valley.    291 ' Red and green, my dear, and straw - colored batist on Sundays." "There, Jacob! I'll go to the head. You said it was blue and green." "I confounded it with certain Highland plaids I had seen," said Jacob. The hour was late when the family retired for the night; nevertheless all were astir in the morning, and before breakfast Jacob Stirling, 2nd, and Robert Johns were in the stable by the side of a second Silvertail,-a fac - simile of the mother, and inheriting her good qualities. They gave up the day to the past, rambling in the woods and around the old red school - house, stopping at last to pick chestnuts under the tree that used to shelter them in the, hot summer days, when they ate their dinners at the school noon- ing. Ruth made her promised visit to Auntie Dole's shop. Alas! its glory had departed.  There were no pickled limes, nor gibralters, nor horns  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7484-00000150"/> 292       My Hero. of plenty, but a few cheap trimmings in the win- dows, and some ruffled aprons, while a sharp- faced woman was working a sewing- machine. Ruth made her way into the back room where the old shop-keeper sat, with her feet upon a stool, and her swelled hands idle in her lap. The par- rot was there in the window, but silent forever; it was no more vicious talking Polly, but her skin stuffed. The glass eyes only stared at Ruth, and knew her not. Another cat, too, dozed on the hearth. Do n't you know me, Auntie?" said Ruth, standing before Auntie Dole's chair in all the bright beauty of her girlhood. The little shop - keeper's eyes were keen and black as ever, as they peered pow over a pair of modern spectacles. "Know you? No, why should I? There are few come to the shop like you. Are you the Queen of Sheba, or Victorian come over to this country?"   In the Lehigh Valley.    293 "No, Auntie, I am Ruth Johns; don't you remember little Ruth, who used to come every morning on her way to school with,--Please, Miss Dole, I want the biggest lime in the jar'?" "You ain't Ruth Johns, a-growed up as tall as that! I can't believe my eyes. I knew you were expected, 'cause Miss Barnard told me you came over in Dick's big ship. Sit right down, Miss Johns. I have something to say to you." "Do not call me Miss Johns; say Ruthie, as you used to do in old times." "Well, Ruthie, then, that suits me better, 'cause I ain't much given to titles. Ruthie dear, I have a word to say, and as I am an old woman, ydu must n't take it ill of me if I speak the plain truth." The bright smile faded for an instant from Ruth's cheek, for the tone of Auntie Dole's voice was ominous. She sat down by the side of the old lady, and her eyes ceased to dance, as she held her hat in one hand and turned her fair face x.  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7484-00000151"/> 294       My Hero. to the wrinkled visage in the large easy chair. "Ruthiedear, I know that 'handsome is as handsome does,' as the saying is, and that we must not scorn people beneath us.  I don't know that you ever heard that I came from a good old family. My  grandfather was a Huguenot, with noble blood in his veins, who left his country because he couldn't serve God there according to his conscience. We were poor then, and I chose to earn my own bread to living upon other people. But what I am coming to is this,- it is natural that I should thinkwell of good blood and good training. Now, I have nothin' against Dick Barnard; I have stood up for Dick many a day; but when all the village talks about your marrying him, I shake my head and say nothin'. It will be a grand match, Ruthie; you will ride in your coach, with serv- ants behind and before, if you wish. You will wear pearls and diamonds, and live in a grand house, and nothing will be around you but pleas-   In the Lehigh Valley.    295 ant sights and sounds. But, after all, Ruthie, there is not a good, pure heart beneath the gold and the diamonds. I have known the whole race of Dick Barnard for three generations, and there is n't any good, honest blood in em. Dick has been good to his mother; I can't deny that; but some day, child, in his eagerness for money, he will grasp too much. Trust him not; trust him not. This came to me like a warning, as soon as you said you were Ruth Johns.  I am not through yet," as she saw Ruth was restless. "There is one that loves you with all his heart. You never prized his love, and may be you have flung it away, as many a gay girl has done be- )fore, because it is not set in diamonds. I do n't know as you are worthy of such love. I used to think you never would be, with your quick ways, and your mischievous little head. But that's neither here nor there; he never will marry unless he marries you, Ruth." "Stop, stop, Auntie Dole," said -Ruth, her  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7484-00000152"/> 296        My Hero. cheeks blazing and her eyes aglow;  ' You do n't know all this. You must not talk so." I :think you were sent to me so I could tell you this," continued the old lady, unmoved by Ruth's excitement; "because to - morrow he will be here with his carriage and horses, and his fine, dashing ways; and when you see him side by side with our Jacob, may be your eyes will be dazzled, and you will not see with the eyes of an old Huguenot, whose great - grandfather was con- cealed in the hut of a peasant for many months, because he dared to preach the Protestant faith; for he was a Huguenot minister. I have given up the shop now, and have time to think; and while I sit here, growing old and 'most ready to die, God has given me a second sight to see people right through to their hearts." "We shall all be afraid of you, Auntie Dole," said Ruth, rising to go. "Stop a minute, child. iou think I do not know what I say, and am old and rambling.   In the Lehigh Valley.    297 Susan Stirling has read to me Jacob's letters since I have been laid up with the rheumatism for two years, and always, in them, all, your name came in, and it seemed as if he loved to write it; and when he came home, he used to sit in here, pleased, I could see, whenever I talked about you. I read his heart in those great dark eyes of his, the most beautiful eyes, Ruth, I ever looked into. But there, child, I may be weary- ing you. I know love goes where it is sent; and if you do like the gold and the silver best, you must' e'en take it,' as the Scotch say." She asked Ruth to open the corner cupboard. As she did so, the same old jar of pickled limes was there with which Ruth was familiar in her childhood, and a basket of horns of plenty. "Help yourself, child; and if I haven't of- fended you, come again and see me." At these words Ruth stooped and kissed the old lady, and then was out of the house like a bird on the wing.  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7484-00000153"/> 298          My Hero. "Heigh  ho 1" said Auntie Dole, as she saw the swift flight. "Heigh ho I perhaps this old woman  is n't as sharp as she thought herself;" and she sat and mused by the fire, which she now kept on the hearth all the year round. The same train which brought Barnard from the city, brought also   the following letter to Jacob: "DEAR Boss STIRLING  "Times is rough here. We have struck for higher wages, and they have refused them to us. Troops are come down, and are here at Broad Mine. We have all subscribed money to help them as will be short, for we mean to stand it out. There is a deal of bad blood here; some of the hands kept on workin', and the others threatened to drive 'em out of the valley. Jake Dunn and old Fogg had a desperate fight the other day; Jake got his eye knocked out and Fogg lost all his front teeth. Fogg's wife was so fright- ened that she was took sick, and died this morning. Some said it was the fever, and may be it was, for a bad fever has been raging over to the Ramsey mine, and no doubt we will have it next. I write to beg of you not to come back at pres- ent. "There is some here that say you are a friend to the miners, and have put high notions into ou4 heads, and that you ad- vised us to strike. Now I know better, 'cause I am captain of the Union Club, and you always told me to wait and be patient.   - In the Lehigh Valley.     299 They will make you trouble if you come, for them troops is desperate and would like the fun of shooting us ' black devils,' as they call us. The men all want to see you, and the wives and children all say, ' If Boss Stirling was here he d tell us the right;' but I am a-feared your life wouldn't be safe if you couldn't stand out square with the strikers. "Your friend and servant to command, "JAC BROWN." "Aye, Aye, Jack," said Jacob as he folded the letter; "you are in the wrong, and you do n't care to see me at the ' Broad.' But my duty is there, and I will be with you as fast as steam can carry me." One day only with Ruth.  Just as he left the farm - house in the old-fashioned chaise to go to the depot, Barnard drove by with his carriage and bays. The young man was quite elegant in his appearance. He had improved in his taste, and intercourse with the world had given him a pleasing address and much suavity of manner. "Money is a power," thought Jacob, and sighed. He had taken his traveling -bag and was saying good- bye to his father, when Mr. Johns rode up  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7484-00000154"/> 300        My Hero. on horseback evidently equipped and ready for a journey. "I'm going with you, Jacob," he said. "I have a curiosity to see your home, and quite as much to see how you Americans manage a 'strike.' They are fearful things sometimes in the old country." Jacob found the miners greatly excited. All work was stopped; for those who would gladly have continued to labor for the sake of their families, were afraid of the members of the "Union," who threatened their lives if they were seen near the shafts. The troops awed some of the fiercer spirits into a sullen, low, growling mood, much like that of an enraged lion who walks back and forth in his cage, gathering strength to break the bars which hinder his re- venge. As soon as Jacob appeared on the ground, he was met by Jack Brown, who told him that it was of no use to advise the men to return to their   In the Lehigh Valley.     301 work, for they were resolute to starve it out if necessary. Wives and mothers came to him, begging him to go to the owners of the mine and ask them to keep them from starving, by yielding to the demand for higher wages. The superin- tendent accused him of aiding the strike by all his " cursed nonsense about elevating and teach- ing the miners. We do n't want anything but good machines," he said; "the less they know the better, if they know enough to do their work." Jacob listened to them all, and then went quietly among the workmen to soothe, if possible, their anger against their employers. "You've  cheated us," they said. "We thought all along you were on our side. Jack Brown told us you were, and now you have turned against us." They could not be reasoned with, and Jacob felt that he was helpless. On returning home one night, he had no sooner seated himself in his house, than he found that he - was surrounded by soldiers, and a prisoner.

But h remained at his post, threatened by one side and strusted by the other, till, at the end r of the week a sort of compromise was effected, not very satifactory to the miners, who merely promised to go on for a while, and did so in a way that auguret little permanent peace. \   CHAPTER IX. VICTORY IN DEATH. HREE   years had wrought some changes in Greenbiook. Grandpa Stir- ling had gone to his eternal home, pass- ing away with a benediction on his lips. Grandmother still lived, cheerful, busy, full of tender care for all around her, but looking for- ward to a joyful meeting with her husband in heaven. Auntie Dole, too, had shut up shop entirely, and was at rest, we believe, with her ancestors, many of whom were among those who won the life above through persecution and a mar- tyr's death here below. The old town kept its old  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7484-00000156"/> 304       .My Hero. look, but the life of the people was not as it had been. Richard Armstrong still rowed his boat-upon the river to the sea, throughout the sunny days of summer, but seldom alone. The golden - haired woman was by his side, chasing away, as far as lay in her power, the gloom which now and then settled upon him, and threw a shadow over the beautiful home. Little Dickie was now a school- boy, robust, full of life, and still loving r his pretty mamma, whose influence over him was unbounded, and whose sweet, daily Christian life was leading him upward, too. Aunt Martha had left the island and made her home with her chil- dren, as she called Mary and Dick. She used often to say that the blessed days of Mr. Richard's mother had come back, Martha took care of Auntie Dole in her last days.. The old shop - keeper's mind wandered often, and she thought herself back in the shop, selling candy and gin- gerbread to the children.   Victory in Death.     305 "No, no, Dick," she would say; "you can't cheat Auntie Dole; that is bad money; take it back, Dick. "Aye, aye, you little mischief, you! Did n't I see you making fun of Auntie Dole; and danc- ing round with a turban over your curly head; and did n't ye laugh right out in meetin' when old Mr. Bateman prayed,-' May thy love be cata- mount in our hearts?' You have laughed so much in your youth, ye may shed the more tears when you are old. "Here, Jacob, come into the back room and get a horn of plenty.

Look up -here, boy, I want to see your eyes. They look just like my grandfather's eyes, the Huguenot minister.

It shined right down and there it found a place to stay." And thus the old woman ran on, till one day she said,- "Shut up the shop, Polly; fasten the shutters. It is a dark night, and I am tired and sleepy." These were her last words. Not all the changes which had taken place,- not even the railroad running through the place, nor the new steam cotton mill which had been r erected, nor the bustle and commotion of settling a new minister,- made so much talk as themar- riage of Richard H. Barnard, Esq., of Madison Avenue, New York, to Miss Bella Bartol, a noted heiress and beauty, who had been the belle at Newport for two or three seasons.

The good people of his native village wondered much, because they had supposed it settled long ago that he was to bring over Ruth Johns to be mistress of his elegant mansion. The newspapers stole a march upon them this time, and flung to the winds all their canny schemes. Their surprise, was not lessened when, only a few weeks after this great event which stirred the waters of fashionable life to a tidal wave, Ruth appeared on the village street, chatting merrily with Dickie Armstrong, and as bright and pretty as ever. Three years had wrought some changes in the people among whom Jacob still lived. His life was a quiet one. He made no commotion, no harangues -on political or social reforms. His name never got into the papers, nor did he class himself with any particular body of reformers. But he wrought a good work, and in the way  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7484-00000158"/> 308        My Hero. which all noble work is done,- by slow, patient toil; by touch after touch, as the skillful sculptor brings life from passive marble. He was often faint -hearted and discouraged, and" ready to say of those for whom he labored,-" O slow of heart," and of others,- "I would have gathered you, but ye would not!" He retained his posi- tion and performed his work. It was better thus, for all the miners who came under his, influence claimed him as one of them. None knew, of r all those to whom he ministered, the sacrifice which he had made for them. Mr. Johns and the city minister understood and loved him. Their friendship cheered him, as no doubt the Master was cheered when on earth by the solace of human friendship. Great improvements had been introduced in the machinery for working the mines. Rich men learned at last that it would pay, and then they congratulated themselves on) their interest in the laborers. It always does pay to do work well.   Victory in Death.     309 Nothing is so wasteful or extravagant as the short-sighted meanness which risks health and human life to make large dividends. The divi. dends are like an exhausting crop to the land. Broad Mine was all that Jacob could ask in its machinery. It was ventilated by four shafts; it was well- drained and properly lighted, and the workmen were superior in skill and in their habits of life. There was an air of cleanliness and taste iln their houses; their minister was a faithful pastor who loved his work, and the church and school -house shared equally his care. Jacob had cultivated a love of music among them.  His own house was often filled with young people, whom he taught himself, and who were ambitious to play upon the organ like Mr. Stirling. The old stone arches of the mine echoed to the music of popular ballads, and, during the war, many a patriotic song rung in those dim and pillared towns, a thousand feet below the tread of an army marching to the field  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7484-00000159"/> 310   '    My Hero. of battle. It was a new experience, and full of promise. Mr. Johns, who came over with his daughter at the time to which we have just referred, and who visited Jacob at his place of labor, had urged him to quit his post for a. while, and go home with him. Jacob promised him that, as soon as he could persuade the owners of Ramsey Mine to make their work as secure as that of Broad, he would go with him to England. The r thought of a few months in his old home, - once more with his "sister," a word he forced his heart to say, -quickened his pulse and bright- ened his eyes. But he had seen a gross violation of the state laws for the protection of miners, in this neighboring mine,---that forty men were working where twenty only were allowed, -that there was but one passage for fresh air to descend to the mine, and but one for the ascent of bad air. "I have remonstrated again and again," he said, "but am put off with promises of improve-   Victory ins Death.     3 ments which are never made, and with the eom- mon remark,-  Don't you see men coming all the time to beg for work? They know the dan- ger, if there is any, as well as yourself; do. you think they would risk their lives'? "These men seem to forget," said Jacob, "that hunger will make a man blind to danger. Come, and I will explain what I mean." They walked a mile or more, and found it as Jacob had said. "You see this journal in the fan of the breaker," said Jacob. "It has not been properly oiled to- day, and is liable to take fire ,at any minute; should it do so, the men will inevitably be suf- focated or burned to death. There can be no escape from one or the other of these terrible deaths. I will ask the feeder of the breaker to oil the journals afresh." He did so. "I have done it, Sir, but it is cheap, poor oil; it do n't do no good." "But your journal is already heated, my boy; just look for yourself."  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7484-00000160"/> 312        Mfy Hero. Very slowly and with a sullen manner thle man obeyed.   "Now tell me honestly," said Jacob, " has n't that journal ever taken fire?  "Only once, Sir; and then I put it out." "Only once!  Did you know that, if that breaker takes fire, and- burns but five minutes, the men in the mine can never come out alive?" "We hain't had no great accidents here." "Well, you are getting ready for one, my man," said. Mr. Johns. They descended into the mine, but found the men as indifferent to danger as if death were not close to them in the deadly gases which needed but one tiny spark to make them fearful and sure messengers of destruction; nor did they realize that, by the negligence of the sullen man whose business was to tend the breakers, they might be forever shut out from the light of heaven. They were careless in the use of their lamps, reckless of laws, eager only to do their work'that they might receive their pay. Surely the man of   Victory in Death.     313 science and the Christian should. give but one answer to the question, -"Am I my brother's keeper?" "You see," said Jacob, "there is work for me here. I will try what more can be done, and something shall be effected if I go to the governer of the state and ask that the laws be enforced. It has been through care for the bodies of my people, as I call the miners at the'Broad, that I have been enabled to educate their spiritual nature."  "What must be done here, Jacob, to make this mine safe?" "Another air passage to and from the mine, the same as at the Broad, and the strict enforcement of the laws. Men must be educated to respect law. Then out prisons will not be so crowded, nor will the community be shocked by these catastro- phes which make every heart mourn.

Now, these men, from the overseer to the boy who picks out the slate, know that fire damp will explode if a spark touches it; and yet, if they can get a chance to strike a match and light a pipe unseen by others, they will do it. God made us to differ, that we might be a providence to those more ignorant than ourselves." "You are right, Jacob. God bless you, my boy. I was greatly disappointed when I saw you wasting, as I thought, your talents and your life in the defiles of these mountains; but you were more noble in your aspirations than myself." "I have not been useless, I trust," said Jacob, "nor have I been unhappy. I must show you a room in my house to which I have never admitted any one but myself." On their- return, he unlocked the door of a   Victory in Death.     315 small apartment, which Mr. Johns found, filled with tools of various kinds, a work-bench, an anvil, and a chemist's laboratory. Here Jacob had invented some improvements in the working machinery of mines, which he wished to show to his old professor in England. "I do n't understand these things, but I have great faith in the professor and my son Jacob," said Mr. Johns. The words, my "son," were sweet to Jacob's ear. Many a night had Ruth 'returned from some party or opera, and sat down to read Jacob's let- ter, into which he wove descriptions of scenery, of the beautiful valley of Wyoming, not far from which he lived,.and the sad story of which was familiar to both of them, and of the grand mount- ains by which he was surrounded; yet there was ever running through all his letters a devotion to his work, a purpose in his life, that showed the heroism of one who followed where duty led,- "his, not to question why." There was in his  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7484-00000162"/> 316        My Hero. life a mingling of the devotion of the early Chris- tians with the activity which this modern age re- quires. "Well, then," said Mr. Johns, "I will return to Greenbrook, and tell our friends that you will be there as soon as you have seen such improve- ments under way at Ramsey Mine as will enable you to sleep at night; and promise me that you will not undertake to educate all the superintend- ents, engineers, firemen, brakemen on railroads and steamboats, between here and home, up to a reverence for law, moral or civil, physical or spir- itual. If you do, we shall never see you again, unless you live to the age of Methuselah. Jacob smiled and promised. As Mr. Johns rode away, looking back upon the young man whose large, dark eyes had a wistful look in theni at that moment, he said to himself,---"I would give more for Jacob Stirling's faith than for all the wealth in thd Ba)nk of England. I thought to be proud of him in another way, but i    '  *   Victory in Death.     317 now I envy him. His life towers up with a maj- esty that excites my reverence." Ah, Mr. Johns, the words would have trembled on your lips could you have foreseen the futurb. You would have shrunk, as did the disciples of our Saviour, from being baptized with him in suf- fering. Jacob exerted himself at once to have the proper alterations made in the mine. He met with indifference, till his persistence and rep- resentations elicited promises that, in the course of aweek, new passages should be made fora thorough ventilation of the Ramsey. Satisfied, from further inspection, of the danger which sur- rounded the workmen, he went down into the mine to pursuade them not to work till the neces- sary improvements were made. This was- re- sented as undue interference, and it was said by some that it was only a pretext for inciting the workmen to a strike. Jacob gave no heed to /these remarks, but finding a little boy at work who was evidently under the legal age, though he  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7484-00000163"/> 318    .   My Hero. swore to the contrary, he sent him up. Not ten minutes after, an explosion was heard in the mine. Some of the men said, -"It is the fire damp;" another ran to the bottom of the shaft and exclaimed, "' It is on fire! We are lost I We are lost! Boss Stirling, you were right; you came to save us; and now you will die with us I " The greatest consternation prevailed. Some men went to the foot of the shaft to pour on water, but the burning timbers were falling down and the dense smoke suffocated them. Jacob's presence of mind did not forsake him. He gath- ered a number together at the opposite side of the mine, closed the door, and began to gather up a lot of fine stuff to plaster the cracks and keep the dense smoke out. They followed his example, and for a short time they had hope of relief. Some one struck up the hymn--- "There is a happy land, Par, far away." ) Jacob joined in with all the strength of his fine   Victory in Death     319 voice. When the song ceased, some one said,- "Pray with us, Boss Stirling;" and  Jacob prayed, though the groans of the dying and the noise of the terrified and helpless mules rose at times above the voice of prayer. The engineer at the top was doing all that man could do. He- stood at his post bravely, enveloped in smoke., He hoisted the carriage again and again till the rope was burned, and he fell back, his arms fear- fully scorched, and he apparently lifeless. For three hours the mine burned, and all hope was extinguished that any one in the mine could be living. The scene above was as terrible as below; some of the men who had been brought up were burned and partially suffocated, lying limp and helpless on the ground. Women were looking eagerly around for husbands and fathers, and, not finding them, rent the air with their shrieks. Steam engines were pouring water in. 'perhaps only that death by fire might be ex-  changed for one by water. Now and then, before  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7484-00000164"/> 320       My Hero. the engineer ceased to hoist the carriage, a dead man was found among others speechless from suf- focation. Not one was able to speak when first brought to the surface. At last came seven or eight men, only one of whom was living and he dreadfully burned, and unable to speak. It was Jacob, alone with the dead men, whom he had tried so hard to keep alive till help could come. He had been more exposed, both to fire and  smoke. than these, but had perhaps, from his more healthful organization, lived a little longer. He was laid in a clean, grassy spot, some distance from the mine, to die. His left arm was burned to the bone; the other, which had been around a young miner as if to protect him, was unharmed. His own people, the miners from the Broad, who had come over to aid the sufferers, were over- whelmed with grief when they found their own Boss Stirling among them. )Such piercing cries as rent the air were fearful to hear. "Stop your   Victory in Death.     321 noise," said one young fellow who had known Jacob all those three years, and loved him as men seldom love another; 'he breathes; he is alive!" At that a woman came    near, -a poor creature, bent and aged from labor before her time. "Let me nurse him! I can do it, Jim. He saved my baby for me when it was most dead with the fever;" and she knelt by his side. But two strong men came, and as they lifted Jacob carefully, tears fell from their eyes, eyes all unused to weeping. They bore him very tenderly to a house near by, and'not even his own mother could have watched more lovingly for the first returning signs of life than did those rough men. To their great delight, consciousness slowly returned. The best medical aid was procured, Jacob's arm dressed, and when morning came, his request to be taken to his own home was com- plied with, every one of the workmen in the Broad craving the privilege of aiding. When laid in his own bed, and surrounded by his people, his'  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7484-00000165"/> 322       My Hero. first thought was for his fellow sufferers at the Ramsey.  He wanted all the particulars, the names of the dead and of those who were rescued, and related with much feeling the endurance and heroism of some of the miners. He then ordered a sum from his own purse sent to them. He had sustained serious inward injury himself, and felt confident that he could not live many 'days. The news of the disaster traveled with the swiftness of lightning through the country, and Mr. Johns heard of it in the city, before the tele - gram came to Stirling Farm. Susan Stirling, the mother, turned deadly pale and tottered into her own room, from which she soon came out dressed for her journey. "I must go to him," she said. This wish had been anticipated, and already the carriage was at the door. Mr. Johns would accompany her. They were seated in the carriage and just turning down the lane, when Ruth came down dressed for a journey. "Take me, Father; I must go to Jacob."   Victory in Death.      323 Her father's face expressed only approbation of her wish, and Jacob Stirling, the father, kissed her on the cheek as he lifted her into the carriage, and said,--"Thee will be the best doctor for him." Susan Stirling found little to do for her son, save to comfort him by her presence. The men and women of the mines each strove to see which could do the most for his relief. It was singular to see these women, little regardful of neatness in their own homes, so scrupulously clean in all their arrangements in Jacob's room. It was found that one side, the left, was nearly paralyzed; he could not recollect how he came to be so injured, but thought it must have been in drawing a young man from  beneath a heavy burning timber, and probably using his strength to ward the blow from himself. When Mr. Johns came to him he said, with a smile,' . You see I was right." "I see I was wrong in not bringing you away with me," was the reply.  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7484-00000166"/> 324       My Hero. When his mother followed close behind Mr. Johns, Jacob raised his right arm, drew her face to his and said,-"It will be easier to die now, Mother!" But when, a few minutes afterwards, Ruth, in her plain traveling dress, without her bonnet, looking as if she were already at home, came to the bedside, he neither moved nor spoke, but, fixing his eyes upon her, looked as if he saw a vision. Ruth kept back the tears that sprang to her eyes, and smiling, said,-"Jacob, I have  come to help Aunt Susan nurse you."  Then there came such a look of love and wonder into those great, beautiful eyes, which Auntie Dole truly said, had caught Heaven's glory in them, that Ruth could not fail to read the language which they spoke. She bent over and kissed him, a crimson flush on brow and cheek. He held her by that strong right arm a mo- ment near his heart. "Ruth, is it more than a sister's love?" "You should not have waited till this hour to   Victory in Death.     325 find it out, Jacob. My heart has often seemed beating with a confession." He held her still, and while her cheek touched his, a thanksgiving went up from his heart and lips to heaven that made his face radiant as that of an angel. Jacob was not able to move from his bed for many days, and when he made an effort to walk, it was found that the whole of one side was par- alyzed. His mother was desirous that he should be carried home to Stirling Farm. Jacob ex- pressed no wish when the subject was first men- tioned; but, some days afterwards, when his mother sat upon one side and Ruth upon the other, he said,--"Mother, Ruth and I have been talking about home. You know how we both love it, but she has found out how much I love my people here, and I think they love me. I would like to spend the rest of my life with them. It will not be long. I am a little of a doctor myself," he added, smiling, "and understand my   &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7484-00000167"/> 326       My Hero. own case as well, perhaps, as the doctors who attend me. I was troubled between my wish to stay here and your desire to take me home; but Ruth has taken all the burden from me." Ruth bowed her head upon the bed, concealing her face. "Ruthie, my darling," said Jacob, laying his hand upon her head, "never was man so blessed as I am. I take the sacrifice, for my heart tells me I would have done the same for you." "It is no sacrifice, Jacob; I am only unworthy of such love." Well, my darling ;-true love knows no sac- rifice; let it be thus. Raise your head, Ruthie, and let me look into your eyes while I tell our mother that we are to be married to - morrow." "My own dear Ruth! my child beloved I " ex- claimed Susan Stirling. "You will take the pain of this great suffering from Jacob." "God bless you, my daughter," said Robert Johns, who had been an unobserved listener to   Victory in Death.     327 this conversation, as he came around to Ruth's side, and stood looking at his two children, proud of the true nobility of heart which suffering had brought out. It was a strange wedding for the beautiful Miss Johns, of Manchester Square, London, who might have chosen a far different place and bride- groom. Here, in this plain, little house, with her father and Aunt Susan by her side, in a room filled with the families of miners, swarthy men, who had tried to wash the grime of years of toil away with only partial success; women who knew little besides poverty and hard work; chil- dren whose greatest ambition was to take the first degree of picking slate from coal, that they might ascend or descend to blast with powder the masses from their rocky beds,-such were her wedding guests. There was weeping at the ceremony.  Even the minister could hardly finish the prayer for the sobs which choked his utterance. But when the  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7484-00000168"/> 328        M1y Hero. ceremony was over, Ruth turned to the minister and said in a low voice,- "Please tell them not to weep so, for I like not tears at my wedding." Her beautiful face beamed with happiness. To know that Jacob had loved her all these years,- that he was hers,-that noble spirit that she had thought so far above her,-this made her feel  C blessed above many of her sex in the privilege of caring for him, and knowing that he listened for her foootstep, and was happiest when she was by his side. True love has mighty power. It detained Ja- cob on earth. It seemed as if Ruth's tiny hand grasped his with a strength of will that defied death. He lived for six months. His father and the dear old grandmother, who never thought to leave the farm till she was carried to be laid beside her husband, came to see him. The miners and their families were admitted freely to his room, and M        .        u   Victory in Death.     329 perhaps his influence was greater over them than in the days when he climbed the mountains, pen- etrated the deepest mines, knew no fatigue, and was stronger than the strongest among them. The presence of Ruth was a wonder and de- light in the village. It hallowed marriage and made it a holier thing to these rough people, rough and grimy to the outward eye; but Ruth found many a warm, true heart among them, many whom she remembered with gratitude and affection all her life. Death came at last, gently and without great suffering, as Jacob had prayed, for Ruth's sake, it might come. There was great mourning when he was carried to be laid among his kindred. A long procession followed the body to the depot, gray - headed men and little children, and women who mourned as if a child had been taken. It was a beautiful summer day; the great mountains wore their softest green, and the valley was hushed as if with Sabbath stillness. Ruth was   &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7484-00000169"/> 330       My Hero. dressed in simple white, and was outwardly calm, for his last words were full of comfort. "Ruth, my darling, cultivate cheerfulness; be my sunny Ruth through life. Death is the portal to a higher life; what matters it if one friend enters a little before the other?" When he was laid in the parlor of the old farm- house, the neighbors gathered to honor his mem-  ory. Among others, with bowed   head and thoughtful face, came Richard Armstrong.  In the evening of that day he was sitting thoughtfully in the western porch of Oakwood, watching the setting sun. Mary was by his side. He was silent for a long time, and as was her custom in those moods, she did not disturb his reverie. At last he spoke. "Mary, what all the books of theology I have read, all the arguments of living preachers, all-my own efforts of will have failed to do, Jacob Stir- ling's life has accomplished. I must accept a faith which has wrought such works. There    Victory in Death.      331 must be a life beyond for Jacob Stirling. A new light has dawned upon me.   I see that where man's philosophy fails, an earnest Christian life forces conviction." Mary Armstrong's face glowed with delight as he spoke. "Thank God for Jacob    Stirling's life and death," she said. "Our lives henceforth are more blessed through him!" What a strange thing is a daily newspaper I We take it up carelessly and anon are thrilled with horror, or transported with joy. A name, long forgotten, recalls friends of our childhood, and perchance takes us back to the marriage altar or the death- bed. The New York Herald con- tained the following notices on the morning after Jacob's funeral. Died, Sept. 6th, Jacob Stirling, Jr, aged twenty-eight, only son of Jacob Stirling, of Stirling Farm, Greenbrook, Mass."

The two paragraphs were read with a peculiar interest by those who knew the parties. Among the galaxy of beauties at the opera in the French Theater last evening, no one was more tastefully dressed than Madame Barnard, well known as the wife of one of our most successful young men. Her diamonds are excelled in size and beauty by few in this city. Her husband's fortunate spec- ulations in certain railroad stocks may well warrant such ornaments for his wife."

It sets forth the evil effects of intemperance and companionship with men of doubtful character, and exalts the filial affection and the religious devotedness which a young and smitten girl may display, until they become both majestic and victorious. May Bell is a rare child, saintly and yet thoroughly human; and Farmer Brown is an admirable specimen of the frank, shrewd, blunt, hearty, noble gentleman, understanding the gospel, and daily applying it in his unique dialect and his helpless life, whUe caring nothing for etiquette, and dealing rather severely with grammar.

It pur- ports to be made up of liberal extracts from the journal of a lady, who begins her record as the happy wife of a minis- ter, and the mother of a promising boy, whose future she paints in rose color and gold. Her husband is killed, her boy has no early genius for piety, but effervesces and runs over perpetually with animal spirits, energy, and question- able ambition,- grieving sorely the mother's heart, that- beats chiefly for him, stirring up her fears and making her faith stagger, and filling her prayers with more anxiety than trust. But her love and patience hold out through all, and are rewarded by finding' at last that the promise to which she has clung ripens into a sacred though unexpected fulfil- ment. The book is full of interest; its simple pathos often starts the tears, its portraits of character are often admi- rable, the whole tone of the volume is most excellent, and the lesson which- itteaches to the young who are tempted to wound the hearts that pray for them, and to parents who long and labor for the highest welfare of their children, is most impressively brought out."

' The author of this volume has studied and mastered his subject, and he taks it for granted that his readers desire definite and carefully compiled information. He has therefore drawn together material from a large field of history and literature, digested and classified it with painstaking and arill, provided for illustrating it with numerous and well executed en- gravings, and brought the history of the discoveries at both PomLOii and Herculaneum down to so recent a date as to leave very little for any ordinary reader to desire, or any other writer for the general public to supply. Whatever is definitely known of the settlement and early life of these cities is briefly narrated; the events connected with their sudden and fearful burial by the great eruption of Vesuvius in A. D. 79, are plainly and vividly portrayed; and then the work of exhuming them is' described and illustrated in such a way as to put the reader in possession of almost every item of information that repeated visits would supply.
