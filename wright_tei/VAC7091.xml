THE MDNIGHT QUEEN; OR,  LEAVES FROM NEW-YORK LIFE BY GEO. LIPPARD, ESQ.   CHAPTER I. NOTE TO srIB READER.-The leaf of "New- York Lfe," which we are About to unclose in the narrative entitled "THE MDNIGHT QtEEN)," is a dark and bitter page torn from the book of socie ty. Too dark, too bitter for fiction, it can only- be ex- cused from the fact, that it is na true history, writ- ten principallyby the main pernonage of the nar- rative, in her own way-a sad and harrowing auto- biography. The quiet atmosphere which imbues the first portions of the narrative wil not appear ^jse owr iniptemesting, when it As contrasted with lae .dark realities of the sequel, The moral of the M4 Midnight Queen," if it can be stated in a few words, may be thus condensed :- The iutter per- 4ion of the best faculties of Mtke heart by the fear of poverty and its fathomless miseries, onoiwed th the love-of wealth for Ai enjoynts ad uw "My childhood's home! Oh! is there in all the world a phrase so sweet as this --"My childhood's home?"Others may look. back to childhood, Apd     be stung  with bitter momories, but my chilhood was ,the' eaven of my life.  As. from   the hopeless present I gaze back upon it, I seem like a tr-veller half way: up the Alps, surrounded -by snow, and. clouds, and mist, looking back upon the happy valley, which, dotted with homes. and rich in vines and flowers, smles in the Msushine far -below. My childhpod's home was very beau- tiful   It was a two-storied cottage, sit-  uated upon an eminence, its white front; ad rustic porch half hidden    by the horse-chesmnt trees, which in the eariv summer had snowy blossoms among their deep-green leaves.  Behind the cot- t  ae rose a broad  and  swelling hill, w ih, fringed with gardens at its lbase, and crowned on its summit by a few grand old trees, standing alone ,gainst the fsky, was in summer time clad along its entire extent with a gannent of gold- en wheat. Beneath Ith   e ottge flowed the Neprehaun, a gentle rivulet, whicah wound among abrupt hills--every hill rich in foliage, and dotted with homes -until it lost itself in the dark waves of   the Hudson.  Yes, the Hudson 'was there, grand and beautiful, and visible alhways from the cottage porch, the Pali- sades rising from its opposite shore into ' heaven, and the broad bay of Tapoan Zee glistening in sunlight to the north. Oh!:that scene is before me now. The cottage with its white front, half hidden by broad green leaves intermingled with white blossoms-the hill which rose be- hind it, golden with wheat--,the Nepre- haun below, winding among the hills, now in sunshine, now in shadow-the Hudson, with its vast bay, and the som- bre vail, which rose into t he ky from its ws tern shore; it is befe .me anow, with the, spring blossoms, the vok'eis, 'the sky, the very air of my childho ods days. In this home I found myself t tfife of thirteen. I was the pupil ',nd the eharge of the occupant of the :ote, a retiredclergy/man, the Rev. Thomas Wal- -rerth, who, havin grown -gray in the active service of his Master, had come there to pass his last days in the erv- ment of competence and peace. Even now, as in the day when I left him for- ever, I can see his tall form bent with age, and clad in black, hls wild pale fe,.' with hair -as white as' sow,-I can hear that voice, iwhose very 'music .was .made up .of the goodness of a heart at peace *with God and u-an. When I ;van thir- teen, myself, the good clergy,..an and- an aged nwoman--the housekeex;4 -were the only occupants of the cot1t,l, . His only son was away at coll.(,.  And when I was sixtecn, my m(:,r, who had placed me in the care (  he cler- gyman years before, came to see me. I shall never forget that visit. . I was sitting on the cottage porch--it, was a June day-the air was rich. with fragrance and blossoms; my book was on my knee, when I heard her step in  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7091-00000005"/> the garden walk. She was tall and very beautiful. and richly clad in black,- and her darki attire shone with diamonds. Very beautiful, I say, although there were threads of silver in her brown hair, and an incessant contraction of her dark brows, which gave a look of anxiety or pain to her face. . As she came up the garden walk, pushing aside her veil of dark lace, I knew her, although I had not seen her for three years. Her presence was strange to me, yet, still my heart bounded as I saw her come. "Well, Frank," she said, as though it was but yesterday since I had seen her, "I have come to see you"--she kissed me warmly on the lips and cheeks- " Your father is dead! my child." A tear stood in her dark eye, a slight tremor moved her lip-that was all. My father dead! I can scarcely describe the emotions which these words caused. I had not seen my father for years.- There was still a memory of his face present with me, coupled with an indis- tinct memory of my early childhood, passed in a city of a foreign land, and a dim vision of a voyage upon the ocean. and at my mother's words, there came up the laughing face and sunny hair of my brother Gulian, who had suddenlj disappeared, about the time my parent returned from Paris, and just before I had been placed in the charge of the good clergyman. These mingling memo- ries arose at my mother's words, and although the good clergyman stood more to me in the relation of a father than my- own father, still I wept bitterly as I heard the words, 'Your father is dead! my child." My mother, who seemed to me like one of those grand rich ladies of whom I had read in story books, seated herself beside me on the Cottage porch. "You are getting quite beautiful, Frank," she said, and lifted my sun-bon- net, and put her hand through the curls of 'my hair, which was black as jet. "You will be a woman   soon."  She kissed me, and  then, as she turned away, I heard her mutter these words, I which struck me painfully, although then i I could not understand them-  "A wo- o man! with your mother's beauty for \ your dowry, and your mother's fate for i your future!"   The slight wrinkle between her brows grew deeper as she said these words:. "You will beta woman, and must have an education suitable to the station you will occupy," continued my mother, drawing me gently to her. and surveying me earnestly. 'Now, what do they teach. you here -  " She laughed as I gravely related the part which good -old Alice, the house- keepeir took in my education. Old Alice taught me all the details of housekeep- ing; to sew, to knit, the fabrication of good pies, good butter, and good bread; the mystery of the preparation of various' kinds of preserves; in fact, all the de- tails of housekeeping, as she understood it. And the good old dame, with her high cap, clear bright little eye, sharp nose, and white apron string with a bundle of keys, always concluded her lessons -with a mysterious intimation, that saving the good Mr. Walworth only, all the men in the world were monsters more dangerous than the bears which ate up the bad children whQ mocked at Elijah. ' Laughirig heartily, as she heard me gravely enter into all these details- which I concluded with, "You see, mother, I'm quite a housekeeper al- ready!"-she continued: "And what does he teach you, my dear?" - The laughter which animated her face was succeeded by a look of vague curi- osity, as I began my answer. But as H went on, her face became sad, and there were tears in her eyes. My father (as I had learned to call the good clergyman) taught me to read, to write and cypher. He gradually dis- closed to me, (more by his conversation than through the medium of books,) the history of past ages, the wonders of the heavens above me, the properties of the plants and flowers that grew in my path. And oftentimes, by the bright wood fire in winter, or dpon the porch under the boughs, in the rich twilight of the summer evening-while the stars  twinkled through the leaves, or the Hud- son glistened in the lights of the rising moon-he had talked to me of Goe-- of His love for all of us, His providence watching the sparrow's fall, His mercy reaching forth its almighty arms to the lowest of earth-stricken children-.of   the other world, which stretches beyond the shores of the present, noPdim and cloud-shadowed, but- rich' in the sun- light of eternal love, and living with the realities of a state of being in which' there shall be no more sickness, or pain, and tears shall be wAped from every eye, and all things be made new -of the holy mother watching over her holy child, while the stars shone in upon his humble bed in the manger--of that child, in early boyhood, sitting' in the Temple, confounding grave men, learned in the logic of the world, by the simple intuition of a heart filled with the pres- ence of God-of the way of life, led by that mother's child, when thirty years had set the seal of the divine manhood on his brow-how, after the day's hard travel, he stopped to rest at the cottage home of Martha and Mary-how he took up little children and blessed them- how the blind began to see, the deaf to hear, the dead to live, at sound of his voice-how, on the calm of evening, in a modest room, he took his Last Supper. with the Twelve, John resting on his bosom, Judas scowling in the back- grohnd-how, amid the cedars of Geth- semane, at dead of night, wile his dis- ciples slept, he went through the unal- terable agony alone, until an angel's hand wiped the sweat -of blood from his brow, --how he died upon the felon's tree, the heaven black above him, the earth be- neath him dark with the vast multitude, -and how, on the clear Sabbath morn, he rose again, and called the faithful wo- man who had followed him to the sepul- chre by the name which his mother bore, spoken in the old familiar tone, "Mary!"'-how he walked the earth in bodily form eighteen hundred years agor shedding the presence of God around him; and even now, he walked it still in a spiritual body, shedding still upon sin- stricken and sorrowing hearts, the pres- ence and love of God the Father. Les-  sons such as these the good clergyman, my father as I called him, taught me, instructing me always to do good and lead a life free from sin, not from fear of damnation or hell, but because goodness is growth, a good life is happiness. A flower shut out from the light is damned ; it cannot grow. An evil life here or hereafter is in itself damnation; for it ^ .wari o. growth. 'aralysis oi; der!cay of   all the higher sentiments and nobler fac- ulties. As, in my own way, and with such words as I could command, I recounted the manner in which the good clergyman educated me, my mother's face grew sad and tearful. She did not speak for some moments; her gaze was downcast, and- through her long dark eyelashes tears began to steal. "A dream," she muttered,-" only a dream! -Did he know mankind, and know but a portion of their unfathoma- ble baseness, he would see the impossi- bility of making them better; would feel the necessity of an actual hell, black as the darkest that a poet ever fancied." As she was thus occupied in her own thoughts, a step--a well-known step- resounded on the garden walk, and the good clergyman  advanced from   the wicket gate to the porch. Even now, I see that pale face, with the white hair and large clear, eyes! He advanced and took my mother cor- dially by the hand, and was muchafRct. ed when he heard of my father's: death. My mother thanked him  warmly for the care which he had taken of her child: "This child will be a woman soon, and she must be prepared-to enter upon life with all the accomplishments suitable to the position which she will occupy;" con- tinued my mother.. PI wish, her to re- main with you, until she is ready to en- ter the great world. But she must have proper instruction m music and dancing. She must not be altogether a wild coun- try girl when she goes into society. But, however, my dear Mr. Walworth, we will talk of this alone." Young as I was I could perceive that there was a mysterv about my mother, her previous life or present, position, which the good clergyman did not feel himself called upon to penetrate. She took his arm, and led him into the cottage, and they conversed for a long time alone, while I remained upon the porch, buried in a sort of dreamy reverie, and watching the white clouds as they sailed along the summer sky. ';I shall be absent tMvo years:" I heard my mother's voice, as. leaning on the good clergyman's arm, she again came forth upon the porch. ': See that when T "et'rprM, sn place of lit., prett y child. you  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7091-00000006"/> will present to me a beautiful and ac- complished lady." She took me in her arms and kissed me, while Mr. Walworth exclaimed: I'Indeed, my dear Madam. I can never allow myself to think of Trances leaving this home, while I am living. She has been with me so long, is so dear to me that the very thought of parting with her is like tearing my heart-strings." He spoke with undisguised emotion; my mother took him warmly by the hand, and again thanked him for the care and love which he had lavished on her child. At length she said "Farewell!" and, I watched her as she went down the gar- den walk, to the wicket gate, and then across the road, until she entered a bye- path which wound among the hills of the Neprehaun into the valley below. She was lost to my sight -in the shadows of the foliage. She emerged to view again far down the valley, sand I sat her enter her grand, carriagej and saw her kerchief waving from the carriage win-  dew, as it rolled away. I watched, O  how earnestly I watch- ed, until the carriage rose to sight, on the summit of a distant hill, beyond the spire of the village church. Then, as it disappeared) and bore my mother from my sight I sat down and wept bitterly. ] Would I   had never seen her face  -again!     ' \ CHAPTER    II.     i A  YEAR passed away. It was June   again.  One summer a ,evening I took the path which led from f the garden to the summit of the hill t which rose behind the cottage.  As I i -pursued my  way upward, the sun was s setting, and at every step I obtained a broader glimpse of the river, the dark i] Palisades, and the bay white with sails. When I reached the summit, the sun was, n on the verge of the horizon, and the sky c in the west all purple and gold. Seating k myself on the huge rock, .which rose on the summit, surrounded by a  circle of o good old trees, I surrendered myself to d the quiet and Serenity of the evening t hour. The view was altogether beautiful. Beneath me  sloped the broad hill,clad pl in wheat, which already were changing ' ..   ....-...,ld t1o  old; farther down, h         .  .   c- my cottage home, half hidden among trees; then, beneath the cottage, the id houses. of the -village dotted the hills, among which wound the Neprehauzn ;r The broad river and the wide bay, heav- g ing gently ip the fading light, and the Is dark Palisades rising blackly against 3, the goldandpurple sky. Alovelierview Ir cannot be imagined. And the air was full of summer; scented with breath of ; vines and blossoms,.and new-mown hay. e As I surrendered myself to thoughts e which rose unbidden, the first star came r tremulously into view, and the twilight began to deepen into night. I was think- i ing of my life--f the past-of the future.. - A strange vision of the great world strug- i gled into dim shape before- the eye of my - mind. D  "A year more, and I will enter the  great world!"I ejaculated. A hand was s laid lightly on my shoulder-I started to r my feet with a shriek, r 1 What, Frank, don't you know me?" r said a half-laughing voice;, and I beheld - beside me a youth of some nineteen or twenty years, whose face, shaded by dark hair, was, touched by the last flush of the declining day. It was Ernest, the, only son of the good clergyman. I had not seen him for three years. In that time, he had grown from boyhood into young manhood. He sat beside me on the rock, and we talked together as freely as when we were but little children. Emrnest was full of life and hope; his voice grew deep, his dark eyes large and lustrous, as he spoke of the prospects of his future. "In one year, Frank, I will graduate) and then-then--the great world lies be2 fore me!" His gaze was turned dreamily to the West, and his fine features drawn in distinct profile against the evening sky. "And what part, Ernest, will you play in the great world?" "Father wishes me to enter -into the ministry, but"-and he uttered a joyous, confident laugh-" whatever part i play I know that I will win!" He uttered these words in the -tone of, youth and hope that has never .been darkened by a shadow, and then turning to me-- "And you, Frank, what part will you play in the great world?" he said. "I know  not; my career is in the hands of my only parent, who will come   next year to take me hence. My child- hood has been wrapt in mystery; and my future-Oek! who can foretell my future?" He gazed at me, forthe first time, with an earnest and searching gaze. His eyes, large and grayl add capable of the most varied expression, became absent and dreamy. "You are very beautiful!" he said, as though thinking aloud. " O, very beau- tiful!- You will marry'rich-yes, wealth and position will be yours at once," And as the moon, rising over the brow of the hill, poured her light upon his thoughtful 'face, he took my hand and said. "Franky why is itthat certain na- tures live only in the future or the past -never in the present? Look at our- selves, for instance. Yonder, among the trees, bathed in the light of the rising moon, lies the cottage home in which we have passed the happiest, holiest hours of life. Of that home we are not think- ing now, we-are only looking forward to the future, and yet the time will come, when, immersed in the conflict of the world, we will look back to that home with the same yearning that one stretch- ed upon the couch of hopeless disease looks -forward to his grave!" His voice was low and solemn; I never forgot his words. We sat for many min- utes in silence; At length, 'without a word, he took my hand, and we went down the hill together, by the light of the rising moon. We climbed the style, passed under the garden boughs, and entered the cottage, and found the good old man, seated in hi library among his books. He raised his eyes, as we come in, hand joined in hand, and a look of undisguised pleasure stole over his face. "See herey father!" said Ernest, laugh- ingly. "When I went to colleges I left my little sister in your care. I now re- turn and discover thatjlmy little sister has disappeared and leftini- her place the wild girl whom I found wandering to- night among the hills, Don't you think there is something like a witch in her eyes?" The old man smiled and laid his hand en my dark hair. "Would to Heaven!" he said. "tlat she might never leave this quiet home." And the prayer came from his heart.   , D E - 1UntU U1J DJ.        I Ernest remained with us until fall. Those were happy days." We read, we talked, we walked, we lived with eackh other. More like sister and sister, than brother and sister, we wandered arm in arm to the brow of the hill as the rich summer evening came on,-or crossed the river in early morning and climbed the winding road that led to the brow of the Palisades,-or sat at night under the trees by the river's bank, watching the stars as they looked down into the calm water. Sometimes at night we sat in the library, and I read,- while the old man's hand rested gently on my head, and Ernest sat by my side. And often upon the pdrch, as the summer night wore on, Ernest and myself sang toge- ther some old familiar hymn, while "I father" listened in quiet delight. Thus three months passed away, and Ernest left for college. "Next year, Erank, I graduate," lie cried' his thoughtful face flushed with hope, and his gray eyes full of joyous light-" and then for the battle with th world!" He left, and the cottage seemed blank and desolate. The good clergyman felt his absence most keenly. "Well, well!" he would mutter, Ca year is soon round, and then Ernest wit. bewithrus again!" As for myself, I tried my books, my harp, took long walks alone, busied my- segfjpi household cares, but I could not recoicile myself to the absence of Er- nest* Winter came, and one night a letter arrived from Ernest to his father, and in that letter, one for Frank! How eagerly I took it from "father's" hand, and hur- ried to my room; that room which I re- member yet, so vividly, with its-window opening on the garden, and the picture of the Virgin Mary on the snow-white&amp; wall. Unmindful of the cold, I sat down alone, and perused the letter-O how eagerly! It was a letter from a brother to a sister, and yet beneath the calm current of a brother's love there flowed a deeper and a warmer love. How joy- ously he spoke of his future, and how strangely he seemed to mingle my name with every image of that future! I read his letter over and over, and slept with it upon my bosom. And I dreamed, 0 such air-castle dreams, in which a wholes  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7091-00000007"/> li!b-timre seemed to pass away, while Er- nest ard Frank, always young, always happy, went wandering, hand in hand uruder skies without a cloud. But I awoke in fright and terror. It seemed to me chat a cold hand-like that of a corpse--was laid' upon my bosom, and somehow I thought that my mother was dead, and that it was her hand. I started up in fright and tears, and lay shuddering until the rising sun shone gaily through the frosted window-pane. Another year had nearly passed away.  It was June again, and it was towards evening, that I stood upon the cottage porch, watching-not the clpudless sky and glorious river, bathed in the setting sun-but watching earnestly for the sound of a footstep. Ernest was ex- pected home. He had graduated with all the honors-he was coming home. How I watched and waited for that welcome step! At last the wicket gate was opened, and Ernest's step resounded s on the garden walk. Concealing myself among the vines which covered one of i the pillars of the porch, I watched him i as he approached, determining to burst n upon him in a glad surprise, as soon as he reached the steps. His head was X downcast, he walked with slow  and f thoughtful steps ; his long black hair fell r wild and tangled on his shoulders. The c joyous hue of youth on his cheek had t been replaced by the pallor of long and % painful thought. The hopeful boy of the last year had been changed into the t moody and ambitious man. As he came on, although my heart swelled to burst- a ing at sight of him, .I felt awed and fa troubled, and forgot my original inten- y tion of bursting upon him in a merry surprise. He reached the porch-he as- he cended the step--and I glided silently n from behind the pillar and confronted II him. O how his face lighted up as he saw tl nme! His eyes, no longer glassy and ab- re stracted, were radiant with a delight too up de6e for words!           re ( Frank!" he said. and silently pressed pi my hand.               we ' Ernest!" was all I could reply, and we stood in silence--both trembling, lo agitated-and gazing into each other's an eyes. The good clergyman was happy that c a evening, as he sat at the supper table. with 3'Trank on one hand and Een st on.' To   Jr- the other. And old Alice, peering at us ys through her spectacles, could not help id, remarking--"Well, well! only yesterday, I children, and now such a handsome ed couple!" a  After supper, Ernest and I went to the id rock on the summit of the hill, where we as had met the year before. The scene I was the same--the river, the bay, the Ly dark, Palisades, and the vast sky, illu- le mined by the rising moon--but somehow e. we seemed changed. We sat apart from each other on the rock, and sat for a Is long time in silence. Ernest, with down- e cast eyes, picked in an absent way at y some fowers which grew in the crevices g of the rock. And Hwell, I believe I e tied the strings of my sun-bonnet into - all sorts of knots. I felt half disposed h to laugh and half disposed to cry. At last I broke the silence-- t    "You have fulfilled your words, Er- enest," I said, "you have graduated with all the honors-as last year you said f you would-and now a bright career F stretches before you. You will go forth into the great world-you will battle, you will win!" "Frank," said he, stretching forth his hand, "do you see yonder river, as it flows broad and rapid in the light of the rising moon? You speak of a   bright career before me--now I almost wish that I was quietly asleep beneath those waves." The sadness of his tone and look went to my heart. "You surprise me, Frank. Now" and I attempted a laugh, "you have not fallen in love since last year, have you?" He looked up and surveyed me from head to foot. I was dressed in white-- my hair fell in curls to my shoulders. In a year I had passed from the girl into the woman. I was taller, my form more roundly developed. And as he gazed upon me, I was conscious that he was remarking the change which had taken place in my appearance, arid that his look was one of ardent admiration. "Do you think that I  have fallen in love since last year?" he said slowly, and with a meaning look.. I  turned away from his gaze and ex- claimed But you are moody, Ernest. Last year you were ;?o hopeful-now so me.   Nicholy. You can, you will succeed in life!" "That I can meet with what the world calls success, I do not doubt," he replied. "There is the career of the Popular preacher, armed with a white adkerchief and a velvet Gospel-of the lawyer, growing rich with the rent paid to him by crime, and devoting all the powers of his immortal soul to prove that black is white and white- is black-of the merchant, who sees only these words printed upon the faoe of God's universe, 'Buy cheap and sell dear.' Careers such as these, Frank, are before me, and I am free to choose, and doubt not but that I could succeed in any of them. But to achieve such success, I would not spend -I do not say the labor of years-no- I would not spend the thought of a sin- gle hour." ^ "But the life of a good minister of the Gospel, Ernest, living in some quiet country town, dividing his time between his parishioners and his books, and dwelling in a house like the cottage yonder-what say you to such a life, Ernest?" He raised his eyes, and again surveyed me earnestly. "Ambitious as I am, I would sacrifice every thought of ambi- tion for a life such as you picture,' but upon one condition." He paused. "And that condition7"I said, in a low voice. CHAPTER III. "ASK your own heart,'ywas his reply, uttered in a tremulous voice. I felt my bosom heave-was agitated, trembling I knew not why-but I made no answer. There was a long and painful pause. "The night is getting chill." I said at length, for want of something better to say; "father is waiting forus; let us go home." I led the way down the path, and he followed moodily, without a word. As he helped me over the stile, I saw that his face was pale, his lips tightly com- pressed. And when he came into the presence of his father, he replied to the old man's kind questions in a vacant and abstracted manner. I bade him " good- night!" at last ;' he answered me, but added in a low tone, inaudible to the old man, "Young and rich, and beautiful.    you are beyond the reach of-a coun"t clergyman.' The next morning, while we were at breakfast, a letter came; it was from my mother; to-morrow she would come and take me from the cottage! The letter dropt from the old man's hand, and Ernest, rising abruptly from the table, rushed from the room. And I was to' leave the home of my happiest Ihours, and go forth into the great world  The thought fell like a thunderbolt upon every heart in the cot- tage. After an hour, Ernest met me on the porch; he was very pale. "Frank," said he kindly, " to-morrow -you will leave us for ever. Would you not like to see once more the place yon- der"-he pointed across the river to the Palisades-"where we spent so many happy hours last summer?"  He spoke of that dear nook, high up-among the rocks, encircled by trees, and canopied by vines, where we had indeed spent many a happy ,hour. I made no reply, but put on my sun- bonnet and took his arm, and ia a little while we were: crossing the river, he rowing while I sat in the stern. It was a beautiful day. We arrived at the op- posite shore, at a point where the perpen- dicular wall of the Palisades is for a mile or more broken by a huge and sloping hill, covered with giant forest trees. To- gether we took the serpentine path, which, winding towards all points of the compass, led to the top of the Palisades. The birds were singing, broad forest leaves and hanging vines quivered in the sun, the air was balmy, and the day the very embodiment of the freshness and fragrance of June. As we wound up the road, (whose brown gravelled surface con- trasted with the foliage,) we saw the sun- light streaming in upon the deep shadows of the wood, and heard from afar the lull- ing music of a waterfall. Departing from the beaten road, we wandered among the forest trees, and talked to- gether as gladly and as familiarly as in other days.  There we wandered for hours, now in sunlight, now in shadow, now resting upon the brow of some moss- covered rock, and now stopping beside a spring of clear cold water, half-hidden by thick green leaves. - As noon dresw near, we ascended to the Top of the forest  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7091-00000008"/> hill, and, passing through a wilderness of tangled vines, came suddenly upon-a rude fkrn-hnse, one story high, built of logs, whose dark surface, contrasted with' the verdure of the garden and the foliage of the overshadowing tree. It was the same as in the year befbre. There was the well-pole rising above its roof and the well-bucket moist with .clear cold water, and in the doorway stood the farm- er's damne, who had often welcomed us to her quiet home. "Bldss me!" how handsome my chil- dren have grown!" she cried; "and how's the good dominie? Come in, come in, the folks are all away in the fields ; come in, and' rest you, and have some pie and milk, and"-she paused for breath--" and ome dinner;t. The good dame would take no denial and we fsat down to dinner- with her, r cmn see the seenebefore me now, -the, carefIuly sanded floor, the old clock in, the corner, the cupboard glistening with the burnished pewter, the neatly spead i table, the broad hearth, covered with  green boughs, and the open windows, with- the sunbeams playing through the encircling vines-; and then the good dame, with hler high cap, round, geod-E.  hmnored face, and' spectacles resting on '  the bridge of her hooked nose. As we i broke the homemade bread with her, we- t were as gy as larks. - Well, I d&amp;o ike tosee young folks e-  joy themselves," said the dame. "Yon don;t know how often I hawe thought, of it yon since you were here last summer: I have said, and I will say it, that a hand- e somer brother and sister I never yet did f ee."  "But you mistke," said Ernest; "we are not brother and sister."     e Only cousins," responded the dame, I surveyingus attentively; " well I'mglad " of it. For there is no law gin cousins p marrying, and you'd make such a hand. I some couple."  And she laughed until t her sides shook.           b Learing the farm-house, we bent our g way to the Palisades again. We had a been gay and happy all the morning; now we became thoughtful. We enter- -ed a narrow, path, and presently came g upon the dear nook where we had spent a so many happy hours. It was a quiet a space of green sward and velvet moss, a encircled, on all sides save one, by the ij   f trunks of giant forest trees; the oak, the  tulip, the poplar and the sycamore- , which arose like rugged columns, their 3 branches forming a roof far overhead. Half way between the sward and the branches, hung a display of vines, swing- , ing in the sunlight, and showering bloa- [ soms and fragrance in the summer air. Light shrubbery grew between the mas- sive trunks of the trees, and in one part of the glade a, huge rock arose, its sum- mit projecting over the sward, and form- ing a sort of canopy, or shelter, for a , rustic seat fashioned of oaken boughs. Looking upward through the drapery of vines and- the roof of boughs, only one glimst of blue sky was visible. Toward the east the glade was open, and over the tops of the forest trees, (which rose from the glen beneath,). you saw the river, the distant village and my cottage home shining in the as. At the foot of the oak, which. formed one: of the portals of the gladei was a clear cold springs rest- ing in: a basin of rock, and framed in leaves and floweray   Altogether, the dear nook of the forest was worthy-of June. For a moment we surveyed the quiet scene--thought of the many happy hours ' we had spent there, in the previous sunm mer-and then, turning our facea to the east, we stood hand linked in hand, gaz- ing over forest trees and river, upon our far-off cottage home. "Does it not look beautiful. as it shines , there in the sun '"I maid, Ernest at fi/t, did not reply, but turn- ed his gaze fll pon me. His face was flushed and there was a, strage fire in his eyes. "To-morrow you leave that home for ever!" he exclaimed;. and I trembled, I knew not why, at the sound of his voice. "I will never see you again. " He drop- ped my hand and turned his face' away, I saw his head fall on his breast, and saw that breast heavetwith agitation. Urged by an impulse I could not control, I glided to his side, put my hand. upon his arm, and looked up into his face. "Ernest," I whispered. He turned to me, for a moment re- garded me with a look of intense passion, and then caught me to his heart. His arm was around me, my bosom heaved against his breast, his, kiss was on my lips-the first kiss since childhood, and   O how differeat from the kiss which a brother presses on a sister's lips! "Prank. I love you! Many beautiful women, have I seen, but thiere is that in your gaze, your voice, your very pres- ence, which is heaven itself to me. I cannot live without you, and cannot, cannot think of losing you without mad- ness. - Frank, be nin6e, be my wife! Be mine, and the house which shines yon- der in the sunlight shall be ours! Frank, for God's sake, say y(Tu love me!" Ite spak' at ml'y feet and clasped my knee s With his trembling hands. OY the joy,t"%. rapture of that moment! As r sa;ii fatce upraised to mine, I felt that I 1oed- him with all my soul, that I could die for hinm. Reaching forth my hands, I drew him gently to his feet, and'fell uiJn his breast and called him "husband'!"' Would I had died there, on ihis bosom, even as his lips met mine, and- the words my wife!": trembled, on' my ear!,: Would I had at that moment fallen dead upon his breast i Even as he gathered me to his bosom the air all at once grew dark; looking overhead we saw a vast cloud rolling ip the heavens--dark as midnight, yet fringed with sunlight. Onward, on it rolled; the air grew darker. darker; an ominous thunder-peal broke over -our heads, and' rolled away among the gor- ges of the hills.. Then the gIade gretV dark as night. We could not see each- other's faces. For a moment our distant home shone in sunlight, and -then the eastern sky was wrapt in clouds, the river hidden by driving rain. Trembling with fright I clung to Ernest's neck; he bore me to the bench in the shadow of the rock; another thunder-peal, and a flash of lightning that oblinded me. I buried my face in his bosom to hide my- eyes from that awful glare. The tempest which had arisen so suddenly--even as we exchanged our first vows--was now upon us and in power. The trees rocked to the blast. The distacit river was now  dark, and now one mass of sheeted flame. ' Peal on peal the thunder burst over our heads, and as one peal died away in dis- tant echoes, another more awfiul seemed hutrled upon us friom the very menith. And amid the darkness and glare of that awful storm, I clung to Ernest's neck, my bosom beating against his heart, and we repeated our vows, and talked -of   our marriage, and laid plans for our fu- ture. "Frank, my heart is filled with an awful foreboding," he said, and his voice was so changed and husky that I raised my head from his bosom, and even in the darkness sought to gaze upon his' face. A lightning flash' came and was gone, but by that momentary glare I saw his countenance agitated in every lineament. "What mean you, Ernest T' "You will leave our home to-morrow and never return-never! The sunshin, which was upon us. as we exchanged our vows, Nas in a onoment succeeded- by the? blackness of the awful tempest. A bad 'omen, Frank, a- dark prophecy of out future. There is only one way to' utft, the omen of evil into a prophecy of good!'" He drew tue closer in his arms- and 'bent his lips to my ear-"Be mine, and now! Be mine! Let the thundeir-'p 'be our marriage music-this forest g'lfad- our marriage couch!" I was faint, trembling, but I sprtag from his arms, and stood erect in thet centre of the glade. My dark hair fell to my shoulders. A flash of lightning lit up my form, clad- in now-white. -As- w: ildly, as completely as I loved, himn I felt my eyes flash with indignation. W" t ordsc like these to a girl who hbe- been reared under your father's roof?'" ,  He fell at nmy feet-besought my for- giveness in frantic tones-and bathed my hands with his tears. I fainted in his arms. 'When I unclosed my eyes again, I found myself pure, and virgin in the arms of' my plighted husband.   The clouds were parting, the tempest wa over. and the sun shone out once more. Every leaf glittered with diamond dropi, The last blast of the storm Wa-g^passing over the distant river and through the driving clouds; I saw the sunlight shin- ing once more upon our cottage home.

"And you will be tnle to me, Frak V"  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7091-00000009"/> u Before Heaven, I promise it; in life, in death, for ever!" CHAPTER IV. IT was towards the close of the after- noon that we took our way from the glade through the forest to the river shore. We crossed the river, and passed through the village.' Together we as- cended the road that led to our home, and at the wicket gate, found a splendid carriage, with liveried servants. The good clergyman stood at the gate, his bared forehead and white hairs bath- ed in the sunshine; beside, darkly dress- ed, diamonds upon her rich attire, my mother. Old Alice 'stood weeping in the background. "Come, Frank, your things are packed,  and we must be away," she said ab-  ruptly, as though we  had seen each  other only the day before. "I wish to e reach our home in New-York before night. Go  in the house, dear"-she kissed me-" and get-your bonnet and v shawl. Quick! my love."       1 Not daring to trust myself to speak- g for my heart was full to bursting-I E hurried through the gate, and along the- garden walk.             i "How  beautiful she has grown Pf I heard my   mother exclaim. One look E into the old familiar library room, one t moment in prayer by the bed in which a I had slept since childhood.     D Placing the bonnet on my  curls, and w wrapping my shawl around me, I hurried from my cottage home. There were a few moments of agony, of blessings, of n partings and tears. Old Alice pressed n me  in her arms, and bid me good-bye. h The good old clergyman laid his hands M upon my head, and, lifting his streaming al eyes to heaven, invoked the blessing of h God upon my head. "I give your child to you again!" he mi said, placing me  in my mother's arms, tl "May she be a   blessing to you, as for cl years past she has been the blessing and p peace of my home!"   I  looked around for Ernest--he had N disappeared. I  entered the carriage, and sunk sob-- cc bing on the seat. "  But I am not taking the dear child Et away from you for ever:" said my mother, se   fe, bending from the carriage wndow. "She will come and see you often, my dear Mr. Walworth, and you will come and see her. You have the number of our town residence on that card. And bring your son, and good Alice with you, r- and" -- he  The carriage rolled away. er  So strange and unexpected had' been 'd the circumstances of this departure from s- my home, that I could scarce believe e, myself awake. id  I did not raise my head, until we had descended the hill, passed the village, ?, and gained a mile or more on our way. t-  We were ascending a long slope, which 3- led to the summit of a hill, from which, y I knew, I might take a last view of my. n childhood's home- As we reached the summit f the hill, I, my mother was looking out ofone win- - dow toward the river, and I looked out h of the other, and saw, beyond the church- o spire and over -the trees, the white walls B of my home. e  Ernest was by the carriage. "Frank!" I whispered a low  voice. There, was a look exchanged, a word, and he was gone-gone .into the trees by the road- side. He left a flower in my hand. I placed it silently in my bosom. "Frank!   How  beautiful you have : grown!" said my mother, turning from the window, and fixing on me an ardent and admiring gaze. And the next mo- ment she was wrapt in thought, and the wrinkle grew deeper between her brows. Before I resume my own history5 I must relate an incident in the life of Er- nest, which had an important bearing on his fate. (This incident I derive from MSS. written by Ernest himself.) Soon after my departure from the cottage- home, he came to. New-York with his father, and they directed their steps to my mother's residence-as indicated on the card which she had left with the clergyman. But to their great disap- pointment they discovered that my tmo- ther and myself had just left town for Niagara Falls. Six months aftezrward Ernest received a  long letter from me, concluding with these words: " To-mor- row  nmyself and mother take passagefor Europe inl the steamler. W e will be ab- sentfbr a  year or more.".   Determined to see me at all hazards, he hurried to town, but-too late! The steamer had sailed; her flag fluttered in the air, far down the bay, as standing on the Battery Ernest followed her course, with at almost maddened gaze. Sor- rowfully he returned to the country, and informed his father of my sudden de- parture for Europe. "C Oan she have forgotten us?"Said the old man. "O father this letter!" replied Ernest, showing the long letter which I had writ- ten, " this will show you that she has not forgotten us, but that her heart beats warmly as ever-that she is the same." And he read the letter to the good old man, who frequently interrupted him with: "God bless her! God bless my child .P Soon afterwards Ernest came to New- York and entered his name in the office of an eminent lawyer. Determining to make the law his profession, he hoped to complete his studies before my return from Paris. He lived in New-York, and began to move in the circles of its varied society. Among the acquaintances which he made were certain authors and artists, who, once a month, in company with a few select friends, gave a social supper at a prominent hotel. At one of these suppers Ernest was a guest. The wine passed round, wit sparkled, and the enjoyment of the festi- val did not begin to flag even when mid- night drew near. While one of the guests was singing, a portly gentleman, (once well known as a man. of fashion, the very Brummel of the side-walk,) began to converse with Er- nest in a low voice. He described a lady--a young widow with a large fortune-who at that- time occupied a large portion of the interest of certain circles in New-York. She was exceedingly beautiful. She was witty, accomplished, eloquent. She rivalled in fascination Ninon and Aspasia. Nightly, to a select circle, she presided over festi- vals whose voluptuousness was masked in flowers. Her previous history was unknown, but she had suddenly entered the orbit of New-York social life-of a peculiar kind of social life-as a star of the first magnitude. His blood heated by wine, his imagination aroused by the description of his fashionable friend, Er-   nest manifested great curiosity to behold this singular lady. "You shall see her to-night-at once," whispered the fashionable gentlemam "She gives a select party to-night. Let us glide off from the company unob- served." They passed from the company, took their. hats and cloaks-it was a clear, cold winter night-and entered a car- riage. "I will introduce you by the name of Johnson-Fred Johnson, a rich southern planter," said-the fashionable gentleman. "You need not call me by my real name; call me Lawson." I "But why this concealment?" asked Ernest, as the carriage rolled on. "O, well, never mind," added Lawson, (as he desired to be called,) and then continued: "We'll soon be near her man- sion, or palace, is the more appropriate word. You will find some of the first gentlemen and finest ladies of New-York under her roof. I tell you she'll set you half wild, this ' Midnight Queen!" "'Midnight Queen . "' echoed Ernest. "That's what we call her. A ' mid- night queen ' indeed; as mysterious and beautiful as the midnight moon "hining in an Italian sky." They arrived in front of a lofty man- sion, situated in one of the most aristo- cratic parts of New-York. Its exterior was dark and silent as the winter mid- night itself. "A light hid under a'bushel-outside dark enough, but inside bright as a new dollar," whispered Lawson, ascending the marble steps and ringing the bell. The door was opened for the space of six inches or more. "Who's there!" said a voice from within. Lawson bent his face close to the aper- ture, and whispered a few words inaudi- ble to Ernest. The door was opened wide and carefully closed and bolted be- hind them, as soon as they crossed the threshold. They stood in a vast hall, lighted by a hanging lamp. "Leave hats and cloaks here, and come." Lawson took Ernest bjr the hand and pushed open a door. They entered a range of parlors, bril- liantly lighted by two chandeliers, as brilliantly fiurnished with chairs, and so- fas, and mirrors, and adorned with glow-  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7091-00000010"/> tng pictures and statues of white marble. A piano stood in a recess, and in the last parlor of the three a supper-table was praead. These parlors were crowdedby some thirty guests, 'men and women some of whom. seated on the chairs and sofas, were occupied in low whispering conversation, while others took wine at the supper-table, and others again were grouped round the piano, listening to the voice of an exceedingly beautiful woman. Ernest uttered an ejaculation. Never had he seen a spectacle like this-never seen before. grouped under one roof. so many beautiful women. Beautiful wo- men, richly dressed, their arms and shoulders bare, or veiled only by mist- like lace, which gave new fascination to  -their chenis. It did not by any means  decrease the surprise of Ernest when he discovered that some of the ladies-those - whose necks and shoulders glowed most white and beautiful in the lights-wore  masks.. "What is this place?" he whispered -to :Lawron, as, apparently unheeded by h the guests, they passed through the par- n '"'uBh! -not so mlod!" whispered his s companion. "Take a glass of wine, my' t3 toy,; and your eyesight will be clearer. M Tlits place is a quiet little retreat, in q which certain gentlemen and ladies of lo New-ork, by no means lacking in wealth P or position, endeavor to carry the:Koran th 'int practice, and create, even in our cold y climate, a paradise worthy of Mahoimet. In a word, it is the residence of a wid- owed lady, who, blessed with fortune, at and ,all te good things which fortune fr brings, delights in surrounding herself Ta with beautiful women and intellectual men. How d'ye like that wine? There wI are at least a hundred gentlemen in New- ar York who would give a cool five ;hun- for dred to stand where you do now, or even as cros the threhokl of this mansion. I'm do an old stager, and have brought you here stI in order to enjoy the effect which a scene Th like this produces on one so inexperienced thl as ypu. But you must remember one the law, which governs this place and all ma who enter it." "That condition?"        ' "All that is said or done remains a ado secret forever within the compass of sill these walls; and you must never recog- get   le. nize, in any other place, aypensonwhom ist. you have first encountered here. This 'as is a matter of honor, Walworth." by  "And where is the-'MidnightQueen '" in,  "She is not with her guests. I see; but nd I will give you an answer in a moment," ng and Lawson left the room. at  Drinking glass after glass of cham- re pagne, Ernest stood by the supper-table, to. a silent spectator of that scene, -whose ul voluptuous enchantment gradually in- flamed his imagination and fired his er blood. He seemed to have been sud- or denly transported from dull matter-of- o fact, every-day life, to a scene in some D- far oriental eity, in the days of Haroun d Alraschid; and he surrendered himself t- to the enchantment of the place, like one o for the first time enjoying the intoxica- s tion of opium. e  Lawson returned, and came quietly to e his side. t  "Would you like to see the 'Midnight e Queen' alone-in her parlor?" he whis- pered. I  "Of all things in the world. You r have roused my curiosity. I am like a - man in a delicious dream." "Uhderstand me. She is chary of her ; smiles to an old stager like me; but I 'think-that there is something in you that will interest her. She awaits you in her apartments. You are a young English ' lord, on your travels-(better than a planter)-Lord Stanley Fitzgerald. With that black dress and sombre fa e of yours. you will take her wonderfully." "But can I indeed see her?" "Leave the room-ascend the stairs: at the head of -the stairs a light shines from a door which is slightly open. Take a bold heart and enter." Inflamed by curiosity, by the wine which he had drunk, and the seene around him, Ernest did not take time for second thought, but left the room, ascended the stairs, and stood before the door, from whose aperture a belt of light streamed out upon the dark passage. There for a moment he hesitated, but that was all. He stood spell-bound -by the scene. If the parlors below were magnificently furnished, this apartment was worthy of an empress. There were lofty walls hung with silk hangings, and adorned with pictures; a couch with a silken canopy; mirrors that glittered gently in the rich voluptuous light-in   a word,. every detail of luxury and ex- travagance. In the centre of all stood the Midnight Queen-in one hand she held an open letter. Her back was turned to Ernest, as he lingered near the threshold. Her neck and shoulders were bare, and he could remark at a glance their snowy whiteness and voluptuous outlines, al- though her dark hair was gathered in glossy masses upon the shoulders, half hiding the face from view. A dark dress, rich in its simplicity, left her arms bare, and did justice to the rounded propor- tions of her form. She turned and confronted Ernest, even as he, the blood bounding in his veins, advanced a single step. At once they spoke: "My Lord Stanley, I believe"- "The Midnight Queen'"- The words died on their lips. They stood as if suddenly frozen to the floor. The beautiful face of the Midnight Queen was pale as death, and as for Ernest, the glow of the wine had left his cheek--his face was livid and distorted. Moments passed and neither hadpower to speak. "O my God, it is Frank 1" the words at last burst from the lips of Ernest, and he fell like a dead man at her feet. Yes, the Midnight Queen and Frances Van Huyden, his betrothed wife-six months ago resting on his bosom, and whispering "husband" in his ear, and nowr-the wife of anotherl A widow! or one utterly fallen from all virtue and all hope! Having thus given the incident from the life of Ernest, as far as possible from the very words of his MSS., let me con- tinue my hiftory from the liour when in cofipany with my mother I left. the cot- tage home of the good clergyman. After the incident just related, nothing in my ife can appear strange. CHAPTER V. I WAS riding in my carriage with my mother towards New-York. "You are indeed very beautiful, Frank," said she, odie more regarding me atten- tively. "Your form is that of a mature woman, and your carriage (I remarked it as you passed up the garden walk) ex- cellent. But this country dress will not   do. We will do better than  ll that when we get to town." It was night when the carriage left the avenue and rolled into Broadway. The noise, the glare, the people hurryrg 'by, all frightened me. At the same time, Broadway brought back a dim 'memory of my early childhood in Paris. Turning from Broadway, the carriage at length stopped before a lofty mansion, the win- dows of which were closed from the side- walk to the roof. "This is your home," said my mother, as she led me from the carriage upthe marble steps into the hall, where, in the light of a globular lamp, a group of ser- vants in livery awaited us.. "Jenkins!"-my mother spoke to an elderly servant in'dark livery, turned up with red-" let dinner be served in -half an hour." Then turning to another servant, not quite so old, but wearing-the same livery, she said: "Jones! Miss Van Huyden wishes to take a look at her house before we go to dinner. Take the light and go before us." The servant, holding a wax candle, placed in a huge silver eandlestiel/;went before us and showed us the house, from the first to the fourth floor. Never be- fore had I beheld-such magnificeeeven in my dreams. I could not restrain jac- ulations of pleasure and surprise at every step-my mother keenly regarding me,- sometimes with a faint smile, and soe- tihes with the wrinkle growing deeper between her brows. A range of parors on the lower floor were furnished with everything that the most extravagant fancy could desire; or exhaustless wealth procure. Carpets that gave no echo to the step, sofas and chairs cushioned with velvet, and (so it seemed to me) framed in gold, mirrors extending from the ceil- ing to the floor, pictures, statues, and tables with tops either of marble or ebony, the walls lofty, and tlfe ceiling glowing with a painting which repre- sented Aurora and the Hours winging their way through a summer sky. "Whose picture, mother?"I asked, pointing to a picture of a singularly hand- some man, with dark hair and beard, and eyes remarkable at once for their bright- ness and expression. "Your 'Ether, dear," answered my  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7091-00000011"/> mother, and again the mark between her brows became ominously perceptible. " There is your piano,'Frank-you'll find it something better than the one which you had at the good parson's." The servant led the way up the wide- stairway, thickly carpeted, to the upper rooms. Here the magnificence of the first floor was repeated on a grander and more luxurious scale. We passed through room after room, my eyes dazzled by new signs of wealth and luxury at every step. At last we paused on the thick carpet of a spacious bed chamber, whose appointments combined the richest ele- gance with the richest taste. It was hung with curtains of light azure. An exquisite 'and touching picture of the Virgin Mary confronted the toilette ta- ble and mirror. A bed, with coverlet white as snow, satin-covered pillows and canopy of lace; stood in one corner. And wherever I turned, there were signs of neatness, taste and elegance, I could not too much admire the apartment. "It is your bed-room, my dear," said my mother, silently enjoying my delight. Why," said I laughingly, "It's grand enough for a queen." "And are you not a queen?" answered my mother; " and a very beautiful one?" Turning to the servant, who stood staring at me with eyes big as saucers, she said- "Tell Mrs. Jenkins, the housekeeper, to come here." Jones left the chamber, and presently returned with Mrs. Jen- kins, a portly lady, with a round, good- humored face. "Frank, this is your housekeeper." Mrs. Jenkins simpered and coiirtesied, shaking at the same time the bundle of keys at her waist. "Mrs. Jenkins, this is your young mistress, Miss Van Huy- den. Give me the keys." She took the keys from the house- keeper, and placed them in my hands. "My dear, this house, and all that it contains, are yours. I surrender it to your charge." Scarcely knowing what to do with myself, I took the keys-which were heavy enough--and handing them back to Mrs. Jenkins, hoped that she would continue to superintend the affairs of my mansion, as heretofore.  All of which pleased my mother, and made her smile.   "We will go to dinner without dress- ing," and my mother led the way down stairs to the dining-room. It was a large apartment, in, the centre of which stood a luxuriously furnished table, glit- tering with gold plate. Servants in liv- ery stood like statues behind my chair and my mother's. How different from the plain fare and simple style of thegood clergyman's home! Nay, how widely contrasted with the rude dinner in a log cabin, to which Ernest and myself sat down a few hours ago! In vain I tried to partake of the rich dishes set out before me. I was too much excited. to eat. Dinner over, coffiee was served, and the servants retired. Mother and I were left alone. "Frank, do you blame me," she said, looking at me carefully, : for having you reared so quietly, far away in the country, in order that at the proper age, strong in health, and rich in accomplishment and beauty, you might be prepared to enter upon the engagements and duties Guitable to your station?" How could I blame her? I spoke gratefully, again and again, of the wealth and comfort which sur- rounded me, and then, forgetting it all, broke forth into impassioned praise of my cottage home, of the good clergy- man, of old Alice, and-Ernest. Something which came over my mo- ther's face at the mention of Ernest's name, warned me that it was not yet time to speak of my engagement to her. That night I bathed my limbs in a perfumed bath, laid my head on a silken pillow, and slept beneath a canopy of lace, as soft, and light, and transparent, as the summer mist through which you can see the blue sky aad the distant mountain. And resting on the silken pillow, I dreamed-not of the splendor with which I was surrounded, nor of the' golden prospects of my future-but of my childhood's home, and the quiet scenes of other days. In my sleep, my heart turned back to them. Once more I heard the voice of the "good old man. I heard the shrill tones of Alice, as the sun shone on my frosted window-pane on a clear cold winter mqrn. Then the voice of Ernest calling me " wife," and pressing me to his'bosom in the forest nook. I awoke with his name on my lips, and----   My mother stood by the bedside ga- sing upon me attentively, a smile on her lips, but the wrinkle darkly defined between her brows. The sun shone brightly through the window curtains. "Get up! my dear;" she kissed me.- "You have a busy day before you." And it was a busy day! I was hand- ed over to the milliners and dressma- kers, and whirled in my calriage from one jeweller's shop to another, It was - not until the third day that my dresses were completed -according to my mo- ther's taste,-and not until the fourth that the jewels which were to adorn my forehead, my neck, my arms and bosom, had been properly selected. Wardrobe and diamonds worthy of a queen!-and was I happy?   No. I began to grow homesick for my dear quiet home, on the hill-side above the Neprehaun. It was on the fourth day, in the after- noon, that my mother desired my pres- ence in the parlor, where she wished to present me to a much esteemed friend, Mr. Wareham,-Mr. Wallace Wareham. " An excellent man," whispered my  4 mother, as we went down stairs togeth- er, "and immensely rich."        I was richly dressed in black, my 1 neck, my arms and shoulders bare. My I dark hair, gathered plainly aside from i my face, was adorned by a single snow- E white flower. As I passed by the mir- J ror in the -parlor, I could not. help feel- e ing a sort of womanly pride, or-vanity; i and my mother whispered, "F'rank, you d excel yourself to-day."        a Mr. Wareham   sat on the sofa, in the o front parlor, in the mild light of the cur- a tained window.  He was an blderly gen- tl tleman, somewhat bald, and   slightly o inclined to corpulence. He was sleekly w clad in black, and there was a gold chain h across his satin vest, and  a brilliant fr diamond upon his rutled bosom. He sat in an easy, composed attitude, rest- m ing both hands on his gold-headed cane. At first sight he impressed me, as an h{ elderly gentleman, exceedingly nice in w his personal appearance, and  that was ru all. But there was something peculiar as and remarkable about his face and look, go which did not appear at first sight. re I was presented to him; he rose and su bowed; and   took 'me kindly by the hand. Then conversing in a ca*l even tone, 2   :a- which soon set 'me at ease, he led me er to talk of my childhood,-of my home ed on the Neprehaun,-of the life which I ne had passed with the good clergyman. I soon forgot myself in my subject, and grew impassioned-perchance, eloquent. I felt my cheeks glow and my eyes i- sparkle. But all at once I was brought a- to a dead pause, by remarking the sin- m gular expression of Mr. Wareham's face. is  I stopped abruptly, blushed, and at a is glance surveyed him closely. )- His forehead was high and bald, and h encircled by slight curls of black hair, y streaked with gray, its expression emi- i, nently intellectual. But the lower part e of his face was heavy, almost' animal. 1 There was a. deep wrinkle on either side v of his 'mouth; and as for the mouth itself, its upper lip was thin, almost imperceptible, while the lower one was - large, projecting, and of a deep red, ap- proaching purple; thus presenting a sin- ) gular contrast to the corpse-like pallor , of his cheeks. His eyes, half hidden un- der the bulging lids, when I began my ' description of my childhood's home, all at once expanded, and I saw theig real expression and color. They were lar:ge, the eyeballs exceedingly white, and the pupils clear gray, and their expression reminding you of nothing that you' had ever seen or heard of, but simply mad6 you afraid. And as the eyes expand- ed, a  slight -smile would agitate his up- per lip, while the lower one protruded, disclosing a set of artificial teeth, white as milk. It was the sudden expansion of the. eyes, the smile on the upper lip and the. protrusion of the lower one that made up the peculiar expression of MAr. Wareham's face-an expression which made    you feel as though you had just awoke from a grotesque yet frightful dream. "Why do you pause, daughter?" said my mother, observing my confusion. "Proceed, my child/" said Mr. Ware- ham. devouring me from head to foot, withl his great eyes, at the same time rubbing his lower lip against the upper, as though he was tasting something good to eat. "I enjoy these delightfta reminiscences of childhood. I doat on such things." But I   could not proceed-I blushed again, and the tears came into my eyes "You have been fatigued by the bus-  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7091-00000012"/> tie of the last three davys," said my mo- ther, kindly. "Mr. Wareham will ex- cuse you," and she made me a sign to leave the room. Never was a sign more willingly obeyed. I hurried from the room, and as I closed the door, I heard Mr. Ware- ham say in a low voice- She'll do. When will you tell her?" CHAPTER. VI. THAT night, as H sat on the edge of my bed, clad in my night-dress, my dark hair half gathered in a lace cap, and half falling on my shoulders, my mother came suddenly into the room, and, placing her candle on the table, took her seat by me on the bed. She was, as I have told you, an exceedingly beautiful woman, in spite of the threads of silver in her hair, and the ominous -wrinkle between her brows. But as she sat by me, and put her arm about my neck, toying with my hair, her look was infinitely affectionate. "And what do you think of Ir. Ware- ham, dear?" she asked me, and I felt that her gaze was fixed keenly on my face. I described my impressions frankly, and with what language I could com- mand, concluding with the words, "In short, I do not like him.  He makes me feel afraid.'" "O, you'll soon get over that," an- swered my-mother.  Now he takes a great interest in you. Let me tell you something about him. He is a foreign gentleman, immensely rich; worth hun- dreds of thousands, perhaps a million. He has estates in this country, in Eng- land and France. He has travelled over half the globe; on further acquaintance - you will be charmed by his powers of observation, his fund of anecdote, his  easy flow of conversational eloquence. And then he has a good heart, Frank! r I could keep you up all night in repeat- \ ing but a small portion of his innumer- I able acts of benevolence. I met him  first in Paris, years ago, just after he 1 had unhappily married. And since I first ( met him, he has been my fast friendc.  He is a good, a noble man, Frank; you i rill, you must like him." ; But then his eyes, mother! and that b   i:r QUEMEN; ORU, - lip! and I cast my eyes meekly tc the - flool. "Pshaw!" returned my mother, With a start, "Don't allow yourself to make fun of a dear personal friend of mine."' She kissed me on the forehead. "You will like him, dear," and bade me good- night! And on my silken pillow I slept and dreamed-of home-of the good old man -of Ernest and the forest nook-but all my dreams were haunted by a vision of two great eyes and a huge red lip- everywhere, everywhere they haunted me, the lip now projecting over the cler- gyman's head, and the eyes looking over Ernest's shoulder. I awoke with a start and a laugh. "You are in good spirits, my child," said my mother, who stood by the bed. "I had a frightful dream, but it ended funnily. All night long I've seen no- thing but Mr. Wareham's eyes and lip; but the last I saw of them, they were flying like butterflies a few feet above ground. Eyes first, anid lip next, and old Alice chasing them with her broom." "Never mind;you will like him," rejoined my mother. I certainly had every chance to like him. For three days he was a constant visitor at our house. He accompanied mother and, myself in a drive along Broadw'ay. and-out on the avenue. I enjoyed the excitement of Broadway, and the fresh air of the country, but- Mr. Wareham was by my side, talking pleasantly, even eloquently, and looking all the while as if he would like to eat me. We went to the opera, and for the first time, the fairy world of the stage was disclosed to ime. I was enchanted -the lights, the costumes, the music, the circle of youth and beauty, all wrapt -me in a delicious dream, but-close by my side was Mr. Wareham, his eyes expanded and his lip protruding; I thought of the Arabian Nights, and was reminded of a well-dressed ghoul. I be- gan to hate the man. On the fourth day he brought me a handsome bracelet glittering with diamonds, which my mo- ther bade me, accept, and on the fifth day I hated him with all my'soul. There was an influence about him, whichi re. pelled me and nmae me afraid. It was the sixth night in my new home, and, in my night-dress, I was   seated on the edge of my bed, the candle near, and my mother by my side. She had entered the room with a serious and even troubled face.' The wrinkle was marked deep between her brows. Fixing my lace cap on my head, and smoothing my curls with a gentle pressure of her hand, she looked at me long and anx- iously, but in silence. ".; mother," I said, "when will we visit 'father,' and good old Alice, and --Ernest? I am so anxious to see my bhome again!" "You must forget that home" said my mother, gravely. "You will shortly be surrounded by new ties and new duties. Nay, do not start and look at me with so much wonder! I see that I must be plain with you. Listen to me Frank! Who owns this house?" "It is yours." . "Thle pictures. the gold plate, the fur- niture, worthy of such a palace?" "Yours, all yours, mother.:' "Who purchased the dresses and the diamonds which you wear?-dresses and diamonds worthy of a queen." "You did, imother, of course." I hes- itated. "Wrong, Frank! all wrong!" and her eyes shone vividly, and the mark be- tween her brows grew blacker. "Tlhe i house which shelters you, the furniture' * which meets your gaze, the dresses which. clothe you, and the diamonds which adorn your person, are the property of- Mr. Warehan." It seemed to me as if the floor had I opened at my feet. "O, mother, you - are jesting!"I faltered.      1 "I am a beggar, child, and you are a beggar's daughter. It is to Mr. Ware- f ham that we are indebted for all that we f enjoy. For years he has paid the em- 1 penses of your education. And now, 1 that you have grown to young woman- v hood, he shelters you in a palace, sur- t rounds you with splendor that a queen might eivy; and, not satisfied  with c this,"---  She paused and fixed her'eyes upon c my fakte. I knew that I was. frightfully f pale.     - "Offers you his hand in marriage." b For a moment, the light, the mirrors, s the roof itself swam  round me, and I M sank, half fainting, into my mother's h arms.                t   le  O' O, this is but a jest, a crnlel jest, to ;e frighten ,me,-say, mother, .it is a jest P d  ' It is not a jest; it is sober, serious Ls earnest;" and she raised mp sterniy g from her arms. "He has offered his g hand, and you will marry him." r  I flung myself on my knees at the :- bedside, clasped her hands, and as my night-dress fell back from my shoulders e and bosom, I told her, with my sobs and d tears, of my love for Ernest, and my en- y -gagement with him. "Pshaw! A poor clergyman's son!t" i    " O, let us leave this place, mother," I r cried, still pressing her hands to my bo- r som. "You say that we are poor. Be t it so. We will find a home together, in r the home of my childhood. Or if that fails us, I will work for you,--I will toil from sun to sun, and all night long,- beg,-do anything rather than marry - this man. For, mother-I cannot help it-but i do hate hip with all my soul." "Pretty talk, very pretty!" and she tore her hand from  my grasp. "But did you ever try poverty, my child? Did you ever know what the word' meant,- POVERTY! Did you ever worlksixteen hours a day at your needle for as many pennies?  tWalk the streets at dead of winter in half-naked feet, and go for two klong days and nights without a mouthful of food? Did you ever try it, my child 1 That's the life which poor Gwidows and their pretty daughters live here in New- - York, my dear." "But Ernest loves mre; he will make his way   in life-we will be married -you will share our home, dear mo- ther."' These words rendered her perfectly furious. She startdd up and uttered' a frightful oath, and it was the first time I had ever heard an oath from a woman's lips. f[Ier countenance for a. moment was fiendish. She assailed me with a torrent of reproaches, concluding thus,-- "And- this is your gratitude for the care, the anxiety, the very agony of a mother's anxiety, which I have endured on your account for years?  II return for all, you condemn me to-poverty. But it shall not Le.  One of us must bend, and that one will not be me. I swear, girl--" her brows were knit, she was lividly pale, and she raised-her right hand to Heaven:' that you shall marry this man!" /  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7091-00000013"/> ':And I swear,'-I bounded to my feet, my bosom bare, and the blood boil- ing in -my veins; perchance it was the same blood which gave my mother her , fiery termper.-"I swear that I will not marry him, as long as there is life in me. Do- you hear me, mother? 'Before I marry that miserable wretch, whose very presence fills -me with loathing, I will fall a corpse at your feet!" - My words, my attitude, took her by surprise. She surveyed me silently, but was too much enraged to speak. "O, that my father was living!"I cried, the fit of passion succeeded by a burst of tears-" he would save me from this hideous marriage." My mother quietly drew a letter from her bosom, and placed it open in my hand. "Your father is living. That letter is the last one I have received from him. Read it, my angel." I took it-it was very brief-I read it at a glance. It was addressed to my mother, and bore a recent date. These were its contents: ' "DEAR FRANK,-My sentence expires in two weeks from to-day. Send me some decent clothes, and let me know where I will meet you. Glad to hear that your plans as regards our daughter ap- proach a ' glorious ' completion. "Yours, as ever, "CHARLESi." It was a letter from a convict in Au- burn prison-and that convict was my father! CHAPTER VII. "T is false-my father died years ago!"I cried in very agony. "This is  not from my fathers" "It is from vour father." answered my mother, " and, unless I send him the clothes which he asks for, you will see him in less than three weeks in his con- vict rags." , "Oh! mother, are you human? A mother to taunt her own daughter with her father's shame -" My temples throbbed madly, and my sight failed. All that mortal can endure and be conscious. I had endured. I sank on  the floor, and had not my mother  caught me in her -arms. I would have wounded my forehead agamst the mar- I ble table. All night long, half waking, half de- ,   1, li:^i, T 4.,-- on m- e!l  co1c - mingling the name of my convict father e and of Ernest in my broken exclama- r tions. Once I was conscious for a mo- t ment, and loosed around with clear  eyes. My mother'was watching over  me. Her face was bathed in tears. She was human after all.  That moment I past, the delirium returned, and I strug- gled with horrible dreams until morning. When I awoke next-morning, my mind twas clear again, and, even as I -unclosed my eyes, and saw the sunlight shining gaily through the curtains, a fixed pur- pose took possession of my soul. It Lwas yet early morning. There was no one save myself in the chamber, Per- chance, worn out by watching, my mo- ther had retired to rest. I quietly arose and dressed myself-not in the splendid attire furnished by my mother, but in my plain white' dress, bonnet and shawl which I had brought with me from my cottage home. "It is early. No one is stirring in the mansion. I can pass from the hall door unobserved. Then it is only sixteen miles to home-only sixteen miles-I can walk it." And, at the very thought of meeting "father" and Ernest again, my hArt leaped in my bosom. Determined to escape from the mansion at all hazards, I drew my veil over my face, my shawl across my shoulders, and hurried to the door. I opened it, my foot was on the threshold-when I found myself con- fronted by the portly form of Mrs. Jen- kins. "Pardon me, Miss," she said pla- cing herself directly before me-"Your mother gave me directions to call her as soon as you awoke." " But I wish to take a short walk and breathe a'little of the morning air," I ahswered, and attempted to pass her. "The morning air is not good for young ladies," said another voice, and my mother's face appeared over the housekeeper's shoulder. "After a while we will take a ride, my dear. For the present, you will please retire to your room." Startled at the sound of my mother's voice, I involuntarily stepped back--the door was closed, and I heard the key turn m  the lock. I was a prisoner in my  own room. There I remained all day tong, my   meals were served by the housekeeper and my maid Caroline. My mother did not appear. How I passed that day, a prisoner in my luxurious chamber, can- not be described. I sat for hours, with my head resting on my hands, and my eyes to the floor. What plans of escape, mingled with forebodings of the future, crossed my brain! At length I took pen and paper, and wrote a brief note to Ernest, informing him of my danger, and' begging him, as he loved me, to hasten at once to town and to the mansion. This note I folded, sealed and directed, properly. "Caroline," said I to my maid, who was a pleasant-faced young woman fil about twenty, with dark hair and eyes, "I would like this letter to be placed in the post-office at once. Will you take charge of it for me?" "' ll give it to Jones," she responded ; he's going down to. the post-office right away." "But, Caroline," I regarded her with a meaning look, "I do not wish any one to know that I sent this letter to the post-office.  Will you keep it a se- cret?" "Not a livin' mortal shall know it- not a livin' mortal"-and taking the let- ter she left the room. After a few min- ates she returned with a smiling face, K Jqnes has got it and he's gone!" I could scarce repress a wild ejacula- tion of joy. Ernest will receive it to- night-he will be here. to-morrow-I wilPbe saved!" The day wore   on and my mother did not appear. Toward evening Caro- line came into my room, bearing a new dress upon her arm--a dress of white satin, richly embroidered' and adorned with the costhest lace. "O, Miss, aint it beautiful!" cried I Caroline, displaying the dress before me. "And the bonnet and veil to match it will be here to night, an' your new di'merdo. It is really fit for a queen." i It was, indeed, a magnificent dress. X "Who is it for?"I asked.     1 i Now come, aint that good!  Who is it for '  And you lookin' so innocent i as you ask it; as if you did not know y all the while that it is your bridal dress, c and that you are to be married airly in the mornin', after which you will set off i on your bridal tower."   "Caroline, where did you learn this?" I asked, my heart dying within me. "Why, how can you keep such things secret from the servants? kint your mother been gettin' ready for it all day, and aint the servants been flyin' here and there, like mad, and Mr. Wareham's been so busy all day, and lookin' so pleased? Laus, Miss, how can you ex- pect to keep such things'from the ser- vants?'" I heard this intelligence conveyed in the garrulous manner of my maid, as a condemned person might hear the read- ing of his death-warrant., I saw that nothing could shake my mother in her purpose. She was resolved to accom- plish the marriage at all hazards. In the morning I was to be married, trans- ferred body and soul to the possession of a man whom I hated in my very heart. But I resolved that he should not 'possess me living. He might marry me, but he should only place the bridal ring upon the hand of a corpse. The resolution came in a moment. How to accoinplish it was my next thought.          * Approaching Caroline in a guarded manner, I spoke of my nervousness and loss of sleep, and of a phial of morphine which my mother kept by her for a ner- vous affection. "Could you obtain it for me, Caroline $ and without mother seeing you, for she does not like me to accustom myself to the use of morphine. I am sadly in want of sleep, but I am so nervous that I can- not close my eyes; Get it for me,"' (I put my arms about her neck,) " that's a dear, good girl!" "L aus, miss! how kin one resist your purty eyes! It is in the casket on the bureau, is it? Just wait a moment." She left the room and presently re- turned. She held the phial in her hand. I took it eagerly, pretended to place it in the drawer of a cabinet which stood near the bed, but, in reality, hid it in my bosom. "Now, mother, you may force on the marriage," I mentally, ejaculated; i; but your daughter has the threads of her own destiny in her hand." How had I accustomed myself to the idea of suicide? It came upon me not slowly, but like a flash of lightning. It  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7091-00000014"/> was in opposition to all the lessons I had learned li'om the good clergyman. "But," the voice of the tempter, seemed whis- pering in my ear, "while suicide is a crime, it becomes a virtue when it is com- mitted to avoid a greater crime." It is wrong to kill my body, but infinitely worse to kill both body and soul in the prostitution of an unholy marriage. As evenine drew on I was left alone. I bathed myself, arranged my hair, and then attired myself in my white night robe. And then-as the last glimpse of day came faintly through the window ourtains-I sank on my. knes by the bed, and prayed. O how in one vivid picture the holy memories of the past came upon me in that awful moment! "Ernestj I will meet you in the better world!" I drank the contents of the phial and rose to my feet. At the same instant the .door opened and my mother appeared, holding a lighted candle in her hand., She saw me in my white dress-was struck perchance by the wildness of my gaze-and then her eye rested upon the extended hand which held the phial. "Well, Frank, how do you like your  marriage dress?" she began, but stopped, ; and changed color as she saw the phial. ': O mother," I cried, :' with my last s breath I forgive you, and pray God that  you may be able to forgive yourself." 1 I saw her horror-stricken look, and I a fell insensible at her feet.     c CHAPTER VIII.       5 ARE we the victims of circumstance, a or are we, in every case, the authors of T our own fortune, or of our own ruin . the causes of our own misery and crime? t A  question hard to answer-and yet ii which a  myriad times ten thousand n hearts have died in attempting to solve. I Are there none who, from no fault of n their own, are suddenly hurled from a a] life of calm innocence into an abyss of ri shame that has no hope; of crime that a, has no lower deep? Are there none who, without a single w effort of their own, with no darkl circuu- m stance to grapple with, not one tcmpta- le tion to avoid, rise to the highest point th of what the. world calls success, and die no at least in peaceful beds, rich in wealth Al wnd honors?             hi   id  Fate and free will are problems never ," to be solved this side of the grave, but s- for myself, from the depths of my agony, a I cannot crush the cry which rises to a- my lips, "What was there inlmy child- is hood, all purity and innocence, to de y serve the unutterable misery of my after ie life?" But to my history: When I. awoke again-but I cannot e. proceed. There- are crimes done every d 'day, which the world knows by heart it and yet shudders to see recorded even ee in the most carefully veiled phrase. But v the crime of which I was the victim was e too horrible for belief.  Warehzm the d criminal, my own mother the accomplice t the victim a girl of fifteen, who had been reared in purity and innocence afar from r the world. When I awoke again-for the potion i failed to kill, I found myself in my room t and Wareham by my side, surveying me , as a ghoul might look upon the dead body which   he has stolen from  the grave. The phial given to me by the maid did not contain a fatal poison, but 3 merely a powerful anodyne, which seal- ed my senses for hours in sleep, and, combined with the re-action of harrow- ing excitement, left me for days in a state of half-dreamy consciousness.  I awoke-my sight was dim, my senses dulled, but I knew   that I was lost, lost! Oh, how   poor and  tame that word, to express the living damnation of which I was the victim! The events of -the next twenty-four hours I can but vaguely remember. I was taken fom the bed, arrayed in the bridal costume, and then led down stairs into the parlor. There was a marriage celebrated there (as I was afterwards told). Yes! it was there that a minister of the Gospel, book in hand, sanctified with the name of marriage the-accursed bargain of which I was the victim--marriage, that sacra- ment that makes of home, God's holiest altar, the truest type of heaven-mar- riage was in my case made the cloak of an unspeakable crime. I .can remember that I said some words which my mother whispered in my ear, and that I signed my name to a letter which she had written. It was the letter which Ernest received, an- nouncing my attention to visit Niagara. As for the letter which I had written to hinm on the previous day, it never went   farther than from the hands of Caroline to those of my mother. I was hurried into a carriage, Wareham by my side. and then on board of a steamboat, and a have a vague'consciousness of passing up the Hudson river. I did not clearly re- cover my senses until I found myself at Niagara Falls, leaning on Wareham's arm, and pointed at by the crowd of visitors at the Falls as "tthe beautiful bride of the millionaire." From the Falls, we passed tp the Lakes, and then retraced our steps, visit'- ed the Falls again, journeyed to Mon- treal, and then hbme by Lake Champlain 'and the Hudson river. My mother did not accompany us.  We were gone three months, and as the boat glided down the Hudson, the trees were already touched -by autumn. As the boat drew' near Tapaan bay I concealed myself in my state-room. I dared not look upon my cottage home. We arrived at home towards the close of a September day. My mother met me at the door, calm and smiling. She gave me her hand-but I pushed it quietly away. Wareham led me up the steps. I stood once more in that house, from which I had gone forth like one walking in her sleep. And that night, while in our chamber, Wareham  and myself held a conversation, which had an important bearing on his life and mine. I was sitting alone in mny chamber, dressed in a white wrapper, and my hair flowing unconfined upon my shoulders; my hands were clasped and my head bent upon my breast. I was thinking of the events of the last three months- of all that I hud endured from the man whose very presence in the same room filled me with loathing. My husband entered, followed by Jenkins, who placed a lighted candle. a bottle of wine, and glasses on the table, and then departed. "What! is my pretty girl all alofte, and in a thinking mood?" cried Ware- ham, seating himself by the table and filling a glass with wine. "And pray, my love, what is the subject of your thoughts?" And, raising his glass to his lips, he surveyed me from head to foot with that gloating gaze which always gave a singular light to his eyes. His face was slightly flushed on the colorless cheeks.   He had already been drinking freely, and was now evidently under the influ- ence of wine.-- "Yo , have a fin6 bust, my girl," he continued, as though he was repeating the 'points' of a horse--; a magnificent arm, a foot that beats the Medicean Ve- nus all hollow, and limbs," (he paused and sipped his wine, protruding his ne- ther lip, which now was scarlet red,) "such limbs! I like the expression of your eyes, there's fire in them. And your-elear brown complexion, and your moist red lips, and"-he sipped his wine again--' altogether an elegant-built fe- male." And he rose and approached me. I also rose, my eyes flashing and my bo- som swelling with suppressed rage. "Wareham, I warn you not to touche me," I said in a low voice. ;' For three months I have been your prey. I will be so no longer. Before the world you may call me wife, if you choose-you have bought the right to do that,-but I inform you, once for all, that henceo. forth we are strangers. Do you under- stand me, Wareham? I had as lief be chained to a corpse, as to submit to by touched by you."  He fell back startled, his face mani- festing surprise and anger, but in an in- stant his gaze was upon me again, and he indulged in a low burst of laughter. "Come, I like this! It is a plea- sant change from the demure, pious-girl of three months ago, into the full-blown tragedy queen,"--he sank into a chair and filled another glass of wine. "Be seated, Frank, I want to have a little talk with my pet." I resunmed my seat. "You give yourself airs under the im- pression that you are- my. wife-joint owner of my immense fortune--my rich widow in perspective. Erroneous im- pression, Frank. I have a wife living in England." The entirely malignant- look which accompanied these words, convinced me of their sincerity. For a moment I felt as though an awful weight had crushed my brains/and by a glance at the mirror, I saw that I rwas frightfuly- pale. But, recovering myself by a strong exertion of will, I answered hLm in these, wcrds:- "Gentlemen who allow themselves  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7091-00000015"/> more than one wife at a time, are some- times (owing to an unfortunate prejudice el society) invited to occupy a depart- ment in the State Prison." "' And so you think you hold a rod over my head?" He drank his wine. "But I have only one wife, Frank. The gentleman who married you and me, was neither a clergyman nor officer of the law, but simply a convenient friend. Our mock marriage was not even pub- lished in the papers. " Every word went like an icebolt to my heart. I could not speak. Then as his eye glared, with a mingled look of hatred and of brutal passion, he sipped his wine as he surveyed me, and con- tinued: "You used the word 'bought,' some time ago. You were right. 'Bought' is the word.  You are simply my pur- chase. In Constantinople these things are easily managed. They keep an open market of fine girls there; but here we must find an affable mother and pay a large price-sometimes even marry the dear angels.  I met your mother in Paris some years ago, and have been intimately acquainted with her ever since. When she first spoke of you, you we're a child, i and I was weary of the world-jaded, i sick of its pleasures--by whichi I mean E its women.  An idea struck me! -What if this pretty little child, now being ed- t ucated in innocence and pious ways, and so forth, should. in the full blossom of c her beauty and piety--say at the ripe 1 age of sixteen-become the consoler of my declining years? And so I paid the expenses of your education (your father consenting that I should adopt you; but  very possibly understanding the fi whole matter as well as your mother), o and you were accordingly educated for s me. And when I   first saw you three t] months ago, it was your very innocence w and pious way of talking which gave an w irresistible effect to your beauty, and fo made me mad to possess you at all ha- to zards." It is impossible to depict the bitter to mocking tone in which these words were ge spoken.               di "I  settled this mansion, the furniture he and so fborth, upon your mother, with m ten thousand dollars.  That was the ca price. You see how much you have cost ni 2e, my dear.)"           im    "e- "But I will leave your accursed man- ce sion"--I felt, as I spoke, as though my rt- heart was dead in my bosom,- "I am not chained to you in marriage. I am od at least free." I started to my feet and re. moved a step toward the door. he  "But where will you. go? Back to as your elderly clerical friend, with every he finger levelled at you, and every voice d. whispering, ' There goes the mistress of b- the rich Englishman! Back to your village lover, to palm yourself upon him to as a pure and spotless maiden?" Is  I sank into the chair and covered my ,f face with my hands. d  "Or. will you begin the life of a poor I- seamstress, working sixteen hours a day for as many pennies, and at last take to e the streets for bread!" t'  His words cut me to the quick. I saw '- that there was no redemption in this s worldl for a woman whose innocence has n been sacrificed. e  "But think  better of it, my dear! e Your mother shall surround you with r the most select and fashionable compa- s3 ny in New-York; she shall give splendid r parties; you will be the presiding genius 1 of every festival. As for myself, drop- , ping the name of husband, I will sink , into an unobtrusive visitor. -When you t see a little more of the world, you will ' not think your case such a hard one af- - ter all." ! My face buried in my hands, I had not one word of reply.  Lost-lost! utterly lost! CHAPTER    IX. MY mother soon afterward gave her first party., It'was attended by many of the rich and the fashionable of both sexes; and there was the glare of light, the presence of beautiful women, and the wine-cup and the dance.  The festival was prolonged till daybreak, and another followed soon. The atmosphere was new to me. At first I was amazed, then in- toxicated, andthen-corrupted. Anxious to bury the memory of my shame, to for- get how lost and abandoned I. was, to drown every thoughty of my childhood's home, and of Ernest, who never could be mine, soon, from a silent spectator, I be- came a participant in the revels, which, night after night, were held beneath my mother's roof. The persons who min.   gled in these scenes were rich husbands who came accompanied by other men's wives-wives who had sacrificed them- selves in marriage, for the sake of wealth, to husbands twice their age; and these came with the husbands of other women. In a word, all that came to the mansion and shared in its orgies, were either the victims or the criminals of society-of a bad social world, which on every hand contrasts immense wealth and voluptu- ous indulgence with fathomless poverty and withering want, and which too often makes of a marriage but the cloak for infamy and prostitution. --I shared in every revel, and lostmy- self in their maddening excitement. I was admired, flattered, and elevated, at last, to the position of presiding genius of these scenes. I became the "Mid- night Queen.". But'let the curtain fall.. One night I noticed a new visitor--a 'remarkably handsome gentleman-who sat near me at the supper-table, and whose hair and eyes and whiskers were as black as jet. He regarded me very earnestly, and with a look which I could not define. "Don't think me impertinent," he said; and then added, in a lower voice "for I am your father, Frank. Don't call me Van Huyden--my name is Tarle- ton now."  . Fearful that I might one day encoun- ter Ernest, I wrote him a long letter, breathing something of the tone of my early days-for I forgot for awhile my utterly hopeless condition-and inform- ing him that mother and myself were I about to sail for Europe, I wished him to believe that I was in a foreign land.  And one zight, while the revel was 1 progressing in the rooms below, Ware- v ham entered my room, and interested me in the description which he gave of X a young lord, who wished to be intro-  duced to me. "Young, handsome, and pale as if from f thought.   The very style of man you I admire, my pet."          I "Let him come up," I answered, and 'Wareham retired.          i I stood before the mirror as the young \ lord entered, and as I turned I saw the m face of my  betrothed husband, Ernest i Walworth.  Upon the horror of that moment I t need not dwell.           t   t, He fell insensible to the floor, and was s carried from the room, and the house to - the carriage, by Wareham, who had led t, him to the place. e  I have never seen the face of Ernest  since that hour. ' I received one letter from him--one e only-in which he set forth the circum- a stances which induced him. to visit my I house, and in which he bade me " fare- - well!" He is now in a foreign land. The ibones of his father rest in the village church-yard. The cottage home is des- olate. Wareham died suddenly, about a year after our " marriage."  The doctors said that his death was caused by an over- dose of morphine, administered by him- self in mistake. He died in our house; and as mother and myself stood over his coffin, in the darkened room,.the day be- fore the funeral, I noticed that she re- garded first myself, and then the face of the dead profligate, with a look full of meaning. !"Don't you think, dear mother'"I whispered, " that the death of this good man was very singular?"  She made. no reply, but still her face wore that meaning look. "Wouldn't it be strange mother, if your daughter, improving' on your les- sons, had added another feature to her accomplishments-had, from   the Mid- night Queen"--I  lowered my voice- "become the Midnight Poisoner?" I met her gaze boldly-and she turned her face away. He died without even a dog to moaa for him, and,his immense wealth was in- 'herited by a deserted and much-abused wife, who lived in a foreign land. Immense wealth in him bore its natu- ral flower-a life of shameless indulgencel ending in a miserable death. : I did not shed very bitter tears at his funeral. Hatred is. not the word to ex-r press the feeling with which I regard his memory. , Soon afterwards my mother was taken ill, and wasted rapidly to death. Hers was an awful'death-bed. The candle was burning to its socket, and mingled its rays with the pale moonlight which shone through the window-curtains. Her brown  hair, streaked with gray, falling to her shoulders, her form terribly ema-  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7091-00000016"/> eiated, and her eyes glaring in her shrunken face, she started up in her bed and clutched my hands in hers, and-- begged me to forgive her. My heart was stone. I could not frame one forgiving word. As her chilled hands clutched mine, she rapidly went over the dark story of her life-how, from an in- nocent girl, she had been hardened into the thing she was-and again, her eyes glaring in my face, she sought my for- giveness. "I forgive you, mother," I said slowly, and she died. - My father was not present at her death, nor did he attend her funeral. As for myself-what has the future in store ,for me-? a0 .for rest! O, :for forgiveness! O, for a quiet sleep beneath the graveyard sod! And with that aspiration for rest, for- givenees, peace-uttered with     all the yearning of a heart sick to the core of life, and all that life can inflict or give- ended the manuscript of FaANCES VAN     C HUYDEN, the MDNIGHT QUEEN. -We will now     proceed to give the 4 eveants of her life after the period com- I prised in her autobiography.          CHAPTER X. [EXPLANATORY NOTE,--Many scenes we might h introduce from the life of the "Midnight Queen," but from  that dark and troubled history we will t select but a single incident, the most important i To understand this incident, the position of her M father, Colonel Tarleton, otherwise known as Char- lee Van Huyden, must be clearly understood. I For nearly twenty-one years from the infancy of D Frances, b. had lived with but one object-to re-  amoe from public view one of the children of a de- ceased brother, to obtain control of the other, and thus achieve possession of that brother's immense ; wealth. For this he planned and plotted; for this he committed the forgery which consigned him to U the State Prison ; for this he had even become a Se silent party to the degradation of'his daughter. One h heir of his .brother's fortune removed, the other in his power, he begat to see, over all the crimes of fi his .life, the great motive of all his crimes ripen into success-he began to see Frank, the Midnight Queen  his daughter, in possessioi of almost boundless h wealth.  The day came at last. Frank, in his pre- pa sence, had administered poison to one of the heirs. fa This was in the morning. Tarleton left her house, to complete his other scheme, to obtain possession Pi of the remaining heir. And evening drew near- tC the evening which was to find all his schemes tri- umphant, andl1rank the heiress of incredible wealth. T1 Let us look into her sad home, in this evening hour.]                    bu IT was toward evening when, amid the   co crowd of Broadway-that crowd of mad     feI and  impetuous life-there glided   like a fra *,   er spectre through the mazes of a voluptu ous dance, a man of sober habit, pallid - face and downcast eyes.  Beautiful wo- men, wrapped in soft attire, passed him ae every moment, brushed him with their ds perfumed garments, but he heeded them he not. There was the free laugh, the buzz a- of voices, and the tramp of footsteps all :o about him, but he did not raise his eyes es nor bend his ear. Gliding along in his r- dark habit, he was as much alone on that - thronged pathway as though he walked y, the sands of an Arabian desert. A man of hollow cheeks, features boldly marked r and eyes large and dark, and shining with the fire of disease, or with the restless- n ness of a soul that had turned upon it- self. and was gnawing ever and ever at r its own life-strings. !  His habit-a long black coat, single breasted, and with a plain white band e about the neck-indicated that he was a f Catholic priest. He was a-priest. Struck down in his r early manhood by an irreparable calami- ty, he had looked all around the horizon 1 of his life -for-peace. -Repose, a quiet - life, an obscure grave, became the objects of his soul's desire, instead of the ambi- tions which his young manhood had che riehed. As there was not peace within him, so he searched the world for it, and in vain. He sought it in a  money-bound Pro- testant church, behind whose pulpit bi- ble,.like a toad upon an altor, (too often,) Mammon, holy Mammon squats in bank- note grandeur. And. there he found money and much cant, and abundance of sect, but no peace. To the Catholic church he turned. Won by the -poetr, of that church-we use the word inits awful and intense sense-for poetry and religion are one- he sought repose in its bosom. Did he find peace? Yes, when veiling his eyes from * * * he opened the gospels, and from their pages saw kindle into life and love, the face of him whom creeds may misinter- pret or defame, but whose name forever, to suffering humanity, is--"  CONSOLA. TION." As he passed thus along Broadway, buried in his thoughts, and utterly un- conscious of the scene around him, he felt a  hand press his own. He awoke from his thoughts, stopped and looked         aroumd. The crowd was hurrying by, but the person who pressed his hand had disappeared. Was that pressure of the hand a mere beak of the -imnagination? No; for the hand of the unknown had left within the hand of the priest, a neatly folded letter, upon whioh, in a fair and delicate hand, was written his own naEme. Steppi g aside. from the crowd, he opened And read the letter. It was very brief -but its contents called a glow to the pale cheek of the pnest. He -at once retraced his steps, and passed down Broadway, with a rapid and  eager step., Hurryig through the gay crowdt, he turned in a few moments into a street leading to the North river: T'he sun was settig, aad cast the .shadow of his slander form, long and black, over the pavement, as he paured in front-of a stately mansimn. He onee more examin- ed the letter, and then surveyed the 1ntnsion. "It is the same," he'sid, and ascend- ed the lofty steps :and rang the bell. "Truly, the offee of a priest is a painfuli one," the thought crossed his minds ' he sees so nmuch misery that be has-not the power to relieve-misery under the rags of the hovel, and despair under the vel- vet of'the -palace." A male servant in livery answered the bell, -and glanced somewhat superc'lious- 1y &amp;t the fded attire of the priest, But he inclined his head in involuntary re- spect as the priest said simnply-- "I am Father Luke." !"This way, sir. You are expected,"  amswered the servant, and he led Father a Luke along a lofty hall, and into a parlor, over whose rich furniture shone dimly I the light of the setting sun. "Remain here, sir, and I will announce your com- He left the priestalone.  Father Luke s placed his hat upon a table, and seated 1 himself bi a chair. In a moment, resting. S his cheek upon, his hand, and turnhig his eyes to the light (--which shone through 3 the curtained windows) he -was buried i in thought again.  His singular and re- markable face stood forth from the back- ground of shadow, like a portrait from t another age. -Hi  crown was bald. but  his forehead Twas ancircled b- dark hair i streaked with silver.  As the light shone 1 over that broad brow, and upon the. great a * X   , eyes, dilating in their sunken sockets, i he seemed not like a practical man of the I nineteenth century, but lIike one of those ? penitenrts or enthusiasts, who, in a dark i age, shut up -the fires of their agony, of, tempted hope or undying remorse, with- in the shadows of a4cloister. t  I is way, sir,"--it iwas the voice of the servant, who touched him respect- 'fully on the shoulder as he spoke. Father Luke arose and followed him from tht room, and up a broad stairway, and along a corridor- "At 'the end' of this passage you will finda door. Open it and enter. You are expected there." . Passing from the corridor, lighted by the window in its extremity, the priest entered a narrow passage, where all was dark, and pursued his way, until hispro- gress was terminated by a door.   e He opened the 4oor and crossed the thresh- hold, but upon the very thresahold stood - spell-bound ih :surprise. It was a large apartment, with loy walls, and instead of the cheerful raysof the declining sun, it was illuminated by a lamp with a clouded siade, which,sum- pended from the centre of the oeitig, shed around a soft and mysterious light. -. The walls were not papered norpanel- led, but covered with hangigs of a dark color. One part of the spacious chamber was occupied by a couch,with a high can- opyxand curtains whose snowy whiteness stood out distinctly from the dark bask- ground.  A wood fire was burning under the arch of .the old-fashioned fireplace; and a mirror, in a frame of dark walnut, reflected the couch with its white canopy, and a table covered with a white loth, which  stood directly underneath the hanging lamp.   Upon the white cloth was placed a crucifix, a book, a wreath of flowers. The place was perfectly still, and the soft rays of the lamp, investing all its de- tails with mingled light and shadow, gave an atmosphere of mystery to the scene. ,Father Luke stood on the threshold, hesitating whether to advance or retreat.- when a low voice broke the stillness: "Come  ill, sir; have waited for you." And, for the first time, Father Luke took notice of the presence of the speaker. It was a woman, who, attired in black. sat in a  rocking chair near the table, her hands folded over her breast. Her head and mace were covered by a thick veil of  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7091-00000017"/> white lcsw, which fell to her shoulders, contrasting strongly with her sombre at- tre. Father Luke entered and seated him- * elf in a vacant chair which stood near the table. Resting his arm on the table, (he sat directly beneath the lamp, in a circle of shadow,) and shading his eyes with his hand, he silently surveyed the woman, over whom the light fell in' full radiance. There was dark hair, there were bright eyes beneath that veil of lace, a young, richly moulded form, beneath that garb of sable-but in vain he endeavored to trace ,the features of the. unknown. "You received a letter?" said the lady in a low voice. "As I was passing up Broadway, a few moments since, a letter was placed in my hand, bidding my presence at this house, on an errand of life and death." She. started at the sound df that sono- rous and hollow voice, and, through her veil, seemed to survey him earnestly. * I am glad that you have come. I thank you with all my soul. Although not a member of your church, I have heard of you for a long time, and heard of you as one who, having suffered much himself, was especially fitted to render consolation to the heart-broken and des- pair-stricken. Now, I am heart-broken and despairing ;" she paused; "I am dy- ing"- "Dying?" he echoed. "And I have sent for you, believing you to be an honest man, not to hear confession of my sins, for they are too dark to be told or be forgiven; but to ask you a simple question, which I im- plore you to answer not hs a priest but as a man--to answer not with the set phrases of your vocation, but frankly and fully, even as you wish to have peace yourself in the hour of death"-- "And that question"--the priest's I head bent low upon his breast, and he i surveyed her earnestly with his eyes hid- \ den beneath his down-drawn brows.  ] "Do you believe in any hereafter? Do I you believe in another world? Does the death of the body end the story? Or, c after the death of the body, does the soul t rise' and live again, in a new, a diviner 1 life 7?;' "My sister " said the priest, with much emotion, "I know that there is a hereaf- s   , ter-I know that the death of the body - is not the end of all, but simply the first step in an eternal pilgrimage"- "This you say as a man, and not as a priest-this is your true thought, as you , wish to have peace in the hour of your death"   .     -. "Even so," said Father Luke. X "Thank you, O, bless you with all my Isoul. One question more-0, .answer me with the same frankness--in the next world shall we meet and know the friends whom we have loved in this?" "We shall meet, we shall know, we Fshall love them in the next world, as cer- tainly as we ever met, knew and loved them in this," was the answer of Father Luke, given with all the force and earnest- ness of undeniable sincerity. Do you think we gather affections to our heart, only to bury them in the grave?" The lady rose from her chair. !"I thank you once more, and with all my soul. . Your words come from your heart. They confirm the intuitions of my own heart. For the consolation which those words afford, accept the gratitude ofadying woman. Andnow," she extended her hand, " and now, fare- well!" The priest, who, through this entire interview, had never ceased to regard her, with his eyes almost hidden by his down- drawn brows-struggling, all the while to repress an -agitation which increased every moment, and well-nigh mastered him-the priest also rose with these words dn his lips: "You dying, sister? You seem young and full of life, and with the prospect of long years before you." It was either the impulse of madness, or the force of a calm conviction, which induced her to reply- "In one hour I will be dead!" The priest silently took her offered hand, and at the same instant emerged from the circle of shadow into the full glow of the light. Therewas something like magic in the pressure of their hands. And the woman lifted her veil, dis- closing a beautiful face, which, already touched with the pallor of death, was lighted by dark eyes, whose brightness was almost supernatural. Lifting her gaze heavenward, she saidt as though thinking aloud- X   "In another world, Ernest, I will meet, I will know I will love you!"  ' But ere the words had passed her lips --yes, as the slowly lifted veil disclosed her face-the priest sank back, as though stricken by a blow from an iron hand, uttering a wild and incoherent cry- sunk back as though the grave had yielded up its dead, and confronted him with a form, linked with holy, and yet accursed memories. "O, Frank, is it thus we meet!" he cried, and fell on his knees, and buried his face in his hands. CHAPTER XI. THE sound of his voice at once lifted the scales from her eyes-she knew him, and the vague consciousness of his pres- ence, which had agitated her for the past few moments, became certainty. She knew that in Father Luke, who knelt before her, she beheld Ernest Walworth, her plighted husband. Sad and terri- ble, indeed, must have been the change which had fallen upon his countenance, that she did not know him, when he first sat before her in the shadow. Trembling in every nerve, and yet strong with the energy of a soul that had taken its farewell of this life, she gave utterance to her feelings in a single word-his own name-pronounced in the soft low tones of other days., "Ernest!" "O Frank, Frank, is it thus we meetl" he cried in wild agony, as he raised his face. "You--you-the only woman that I ever loved-you, whose very memory has torn my heart since that fatal hour when I met you in the accursed haunt of death." "Ernest, you will sit by me as I die, you will press your hand in forgiveness on my forehead, my last look shall en- counter yours-" She opened her dark robe, and dis-* closed the snow-white dress which she wore beneath it That dress was a shroud. Yes, the beautiful form, the bosom' which had once been the home of a pure and stainless love, and which had beat with the throb of sensual pas- sion, were now attired in a shroud. "Behold me, attired for the grave!" Zshe said-and the tears started to her        ,   eyes!"; This morning, resolved to quit this life, which for me has been a life of unutterable shams and despair, I pre- pared for my departure. Everything is ready. Come, Ernest, and behold the preparations for my bridal." She point- ed to the couch; he rose and followed her. "I am in love with death, and will wed him ere an hour is gone." She drew aside the curtains, and upon the white coverlet Ernest beheld a dark object--a coffin covered with black cloth, and. glittering with a silver plate. "Everything is ready, Ernest, and I am going. Nay, do not weep, do not at- tempt to touch my hand. I am but a poor, polluted thing, a wreck. a 'misera- ble, miserable wreck! My touch would pollute you. I am not worthy your tears."  Ernest hid his face in the hangings of the couch. He writhed in agony. "You shall not die! you must be saved!" he wildly exclaimed. She walked across the floor with an even step, and in a moment she was seated in the rocking-chair, with Ernest before her, his face hidden in his hands. Her face grew paler every moment; her eyes brightened; and the shroud which enveloped her bosom began to quiver' with the last pulsations of her dying heart.  As the veil mingled its fleecy folds with her raven hair, she looked very beautiful; yes, beautiful with the touch of death. And as Ernest, choked with his agony, sat before her, hiding his face, she talked in a calm, even tone: "Oh, life! life! you have been a bitter draught to me, and now I'm about to leave you!

Ernest knelt beside her, and with his eyes flashing from their sunken sockets he clasped his hands, and uttered a prayer for the dead. The prayer was said, and Ernest rose -his face all fixed as marble his eyes all tearless ; and in an absent way placed his hand upon the head of the dead wo- man, smoothed her dark hair, put his kiss upon her Clammy  forehead. and closed thdse .eyes which had looked their last upon this world. And she sat therein her death-chair, cold and dead, but very beautiful; this sad child' of shame. Ernest, resting his haads-upon the Pam  of the chair, hid his face from the light.

A voice broke the dead stillness, and a livid face was uplifted from the floor- "It's an infernal dream, Frank, all a dream! The estate is ours! One heir by this time is dead-the other in my power!

But let the Man of the World tell his story for himself, in his own way.  , MT family was one of the oldest in the State of New-York; one of those indeed which, dating from the days of Dutch ascendency, pride themselves more upon blood than money. I was just twenty-one, when, having completed my collegiate course at Harvlward, I returned home, my heart filled with the bright6st anticipations. My father was wealthy, my cousin Eva- beautiful, and she loved me-thus ran my thoughts--and as soon as I get home I will marry Eva. Night had fallen, as, landing at the Battery, I took my way along Broadway toward my father's mansion, one of those lordly : palaces of the  upper regions of New-  York.   As I picked my way, by the flaring gas-lights, what a world of fancies i rushed upon   me, and, amid them  all,  Eva's face, with its clear hazel eyes and auburn,hair!    ! Arrived at home, I   found my father ( sitting alone in the front parlor; he was ( reading by the light of a  shaded lamp. t He greeted me warmly, and shading his i eyes with his hand, contemplated  me long. and attentively.         1 "Why, my   boy, you have grown quite n handsome! A   student and handsome- f quite odd, I  declare!"        s At this time I  was about the medium c height, my  frame broad in the shoulders v and slender in the waist, my  step elastic,  and as 'to my face, it partook of the c   mingled Dutch and Spanish' lineage of , our family--clear complexion, dark hair s and brows, aquiline features, and eyes of deep brown. My father, of course, being near sixty, was a man of altogether different appear- ance.- In former years he had been famed for his manly beauty, but age and habits of epicurean ease, had rendered him portly, almost obese. His features were full and florid, his hair white as snow. As he leaned back in his chair. crossing his foot over a second chair, lifting his eye-glass with one hand, while the other held the newspaper, he looked the very picture of a good-natured, self- complacent man of the world. "You have grown quite handsome" said he; "and now, my dear Frazke having graduated with all 'the honors, and so forth, let me know what you in- tend to do?"  I at once, seated familiarly by his side, opened my plans to him; spoke of his wealth; of my  determination to marry f my cousin, and then to pursue the study of the law. - He listened with one eye half closed, one finger laid gently on his nose, giving no sign of his sentiments further than an occasional " hum!" "You   are wealthy, father.  Eva's family are wealthy; we -are suited  to each other; and once married to Eva I can pursue my profession, and gain dis- tinction at the bar." Thus I remarked, when my father interrupted me. "This is all very well reasoned, and looks bright, but we will talk of it to- morrow. By the bye, Frank, do ime a favor. You are tired, I know, but. I am sure you will not 'deny me. On this card is written the address of a tenant, whose rent is long in arrears. I wsh you would take a  -'.rriage at once, pro- ceed to the house, see the party, and as- 39   certain definitely about the probable time when the money will be paid." This was a singular request. ' Why not entrust the matter to your regular agent?" I began, when my father inter- rapted me with an impetuous wave of his hand, and the Words, "Not a' word more. Frank. Do me the favor," and took up his paper.  . Without a word, I put the card in my pocket, wrapped my cloak around me, (it was a clear, cold winter night,) and left the room and the house. 1 soon secured a hack, and directed the driver to pro- ceed as fast as possible to the house whose number was on the card-it was some two miles from the head of Broad- way, being out in the half inhabited re- gions of the Sixth avenue. As the, car- riage rolled on its way, I gave myself up to all sorts of waking dreams, Eva's face prominent among all. At last the car- riage stopped, and I found myself in front of a row  of three-story brick houses, which stood alone on a street newly laid out, near the avenue. Dismounting from I the carriage, I cast a glance around the ] gloomy region, which. by the light of a  cloudy winter night, presented only an c indistinct view of unfinished buildings, I varying the surface of a large plain, ter- a minated by the Hudson river, and then I ascended the step of the house designa- a ted on the card. I rang the bell-soon a tall female with a handkerchief tied t about her head appeared.       e "Is the lady or gentlemen of the n house," I  did'nt know which to name, ft "within?"              h "Yer business, sur," was the response. n "I  wish to see the person of the c house," said I firmly. "Then walk this way, Sur," was the ' replyj and I was led into an entry, and h from thence into a  small parlor, neatly fi furnished, and lighted only by a coal fire burning in the grate. Seating myself on w the sofa, I occupied myselft in wondering as about the occupant of the house, as to y: who he or she might be; and this train- of thought exhausted, I busied myself in do picturing Eva's beautiful face, amid the embers of the coal fire. My reverie was w abruptly broken.          in A   light suddenly mingled with the he rays of the fire, and on the threshold of br the door that led into the next room, h stood a   beautiful girl, not more than ag 3   ,le eighteen years old, dressed in a garment of white muslin, her hair unbound, and ly her uplifted hand holding a candle above ar her head. Certainly she was very beau- r- tiful. Below the medium height, her of bosom prominent, her waist lithe and rd pliant, her shape fiull in its outlines, her id hands and feet exquisitely small. She was one of those women, whose rich ly complexion, moist red lips, and deep blue it gray eyes, speak at once of the purity of ft the maiden--the passion of the matured M d woman. "- Whom did you wish to see?" she e asked, lifting the candlestick with one s hand, and shading her eyes with the 1- other. "Eva!"I cried, bounding from the - sofa and folding'her in my arms. She p uttered a faint cry, and sunk half faint- ing on my breast. The candlestick had fallen to the floor, and I could only see t her blushing face by the4ight of the coal fire. I bore her to the sofa, seated her I by my side, and cradled her head on my i breast; there was a moment of voiceless passion. I kissed her on the lips; the icheeks, the brow-nay, kissed the waves * iof her glossy brown hair. Then raising , her head from  my breast, even as her arms clung convulsively about my neck, I suffered my gaze to devour her young and glowing countenance.  !"Eva, darling, you were always beau- tiful, but now -you are an angel!"  Her eyes were downcast, she did not meet my   gaze, but, unwinding 'her arms from  my neck, crossed her hands on her lap, and sat silent and trembling by my side. This sudden change of manner confounded me. I overwhelmed her with questions; "'Do you not love me, Eva? What has happened,to wound you?    Why do I find you here, in this lonely house?" She at length raised her eyes; they were filled with tears. "O Frank," she said, "O Frspk, has not your father told you all?" "Told me all?"Hechoed in vague won- der. And then in a voice broken by sobs with eyes now downcast, and now raised in imploring entreaty to my face, whilo her hands alternately clasped her un- braided hair, and pulled at the ruffles of her robe, the told me. the cause of her. agitation.  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7091-00000020"/> "A week ago father died-died insol- vent.

And your father --" "And my father, --" "And your father informed us thathe was on the brink of insolvency. All his future was gone-the very house in which he lived 'hopelessly mortgaged.' 'My clear Eva,' said he, 'rich as I seem to be. I am something worse than a beggar.'  She paused-I need not say that this news fell on me like the stroke of a thun- derbolt. But nervously anxious to hear the sequel of the story, I could only beg her to proceed.   / "And then, expatiating on the hope- :less poverty which had suddenly fallen on both of our families, he begged me, without delay,-" she stopped; and gasp- ed for breath-2i" to repair our fallen for- tunes by a marriage. -A Wall-street merchant, twice my age, and very rich, had spoken to him aboutme--was willing, at once, to marry me. This merchant was one of your father's largest creditors -once married to me. he would not press his claim.. And, Frank-oh! I shall sink into the floor-I cannot go on!" She buried her, face on her bosom, and burst into tears. As for me, my heart grew like ice. "And you colisented to marry him?" I faltered. Her voice was death-like, as she re- plied: "Yes. To save your father from ruin, to save you and myself from the calami- ty of a marriage which would condemn you to hopeless poverty, I consented. This morning we were married in Trini- ty Church, and to-night-yes, within an hour- -my husband will come, to bear me froma this house (where with mother, I have lived since father's death) to his own splendid mansion." She could say no more; she flung her- self upon the arm of the sofa, and gave full vent to her agony. As for me, I was paralyzed. "Eva married to another, who will eome within an hour to bear her to his mansion, there to gather to his embrace the woman whom lie has bought." It f   was this thought which seemed written in letters of fire upon my brain. Sudden- ly the bell rang; Eva started up, pale and shuddering. " Frank. it is he-Mr. Walmer-my husband! What shall we do? He must not see you-he must not see you!" Conscjous that I was pale, as death, I rose fro!h the sofa. My resolution was taken. "Eva, I will answer the bell," I said, and grasped  her wrist,-"nay, not a word I. am resolved." And forcing her to a seat upon the sofa, I left the room and hurried along the entry to the front door.  "Mr.  W almer-and so it is that red-faced bon-vivant, who has purchased Eva!" the thought ran through my mind. "Well, Mr. Walmer! You shall never cross this threshold!" Firmly resolved to lay him  dead at my feet, ere he crossed the threshold, I opened the door. "Does Mrs. Walmer live here?" said a voice-it was not the voice of the port- ly Mr. Walmer, but of a thick-set ser- vant in livery. "Yes." "Here is a note for her, from  Mr. Walmer. It does not require an an- swer," and before I had time to say a word, the thick-set- servant 'went down the steps and disappeared. I closed the door, reentered the par- lor, and gave the note ;to Eva; she was pale as death, as, bending toward the tire, she opened it, and perused its con- tents. And then, With a faint cry, she fell insensible to the floor. It may be guessed that I grasped the note from  her fingers, and madly de- voured its contents. Judge of my sur prise when I read:- CHAPTER XIII.

Here was indeed food for thought l   The sensuality of the bon-vivant had, for a time, yielded to, his avarice. Eva was- respited for at least four weeks- respited from a fate worse than death. Iwas almost mad with joy. Raising her gently from the floor, I bore her to the sofa, and cradled her in my arms, as though she had been a child, and awoke her back to life by my passionate and burning kisses. "Q Frank, is it not all a dream-the letter,. the letter!" were the first, words which she said. I placed the letter in her hand; she read it again, and then raised a face to me all radiant and joy- ous. Her bosom heaved over the folds of hex robe-her eyes shone with deep light. "And youwill go and reside in his splendid mansion?"I whispered. "No," she answered softly, with down- cast eyes, "I will remain in this house- this house, which mother and I pur- chased and rented with money derived from the wreck of father's estate. Mo- ther is sick in bed. up-stairs, prostrated by a nervous attack, and nOds all my care." While thus speaking, she had gently disengaged herself from my arms, and. took hen seat, at a short distance fromn me, on the sofa. She was very beauti- ful, and the light of the fire cast a soft glow over her face, her dark hair, and dress, spotless aA snow. For a few mIo- ments, silence prevailed--a silence pain- ful and, embarrassing to both of us. I was afraid 'to speak-even afraid to de- crease the slight distance which sepa- rated us. At last, I said to her in a low voice, as we sat alone in that quiet parlor- "Eva, what is marriage?" I saNs; her bosom heave and her color come and go. "Is it a ceremony performed in Trinity Church, between a purchaser and his purchases by a priest who acts as auc- tioneer? Or is it the consummation of a .holy vow, made ini childhood, by two young hearts, whom God has destined for/each other?" I paused-threading her hands in an absent manner, through the waves of her unbound hair, she remained silent--. 'but for a moment only. She rose, ra- diant as much with her virgin purity, as with her passionate loveliness of look and. shape-she. rose. and came gently   to me, laying one land on each of ray shoulders, and bending down until hei bosom beat against my cheek. 4' You are my husband,-you only,"- and she pressed her lips to mine. * * The intense delight, the holy passion of that hour, I shall never forget. And the hours glided away, unperceived, whii we lost ourselves in one of those waking dreams, which never happen to the same person twice in a lifetime. "Father!"-it was thus I soliloquize4d, as, passing from the home of Eva, after midnight, I re-entered. the carriage- "Father! you are a man of the worldt and a worldly-wise man; so is your friend Walmer,-both cunning men. Eva and I are but children, but somehow I think we are ahead of you, this time n I did not meet my father until next morning, at breakfast. The table was spread for two,'and we sat alone, facing each- ther, in the elegant breakfast rootm where the rays of the morning sun were tempered by closely drawn curtains. How calm and self-possessed he looked in his snow-white ruffles and embroider- ed dressing-gown, as, cracking an egg ip the glass. he regarded me curiously, one eye half closed! '; W ell, Frank, did you see the. ten- ant?" hle said quietly. "I did, father," and, imitating his noH- chalance, slowly sipped my coffee. He evidently expected a burst of rage from me; but my mother's blood pre- dominated in my veins, and I met has Dutch phletgm with the cautiousness of the Spaniard. A long pause ensued. "' Zounds! why don't you talk?" he cried at last, setting his cup on the table, with a sort of china-ware -emphasis-a kind of croclkery "damn." "Do you blame me forlhving married Eva, and married her well; rich. and so-forth, thus saving both you and her from a poor marriage and its consequences?" "N o doubt you acted for the best,. father," I answered quietly. "By this time, Frank, you are awr-: that 1 am something worse than a beg- gar. As for her father, he died insol- vent. It becomes. us to look around us. Eva's marriage secures her, and will give us, for some time longer, possession of this house, for Walmer holds the mort- gage.

I have transacted some business for her, and know that she is anxious for a husband; a young one, one who has style. In fact, I have spoken to her of you, and-" He was interrupted by the entrance of a person who bounced into the room very much like a bombshell. It was a very short lady, broad in the shoulders, very ample in the form, with a dark com- plexion, somewhat spotted, a hooked nose, and very dark hair, which, like her white teeth, evidently belonged to some person long since deceased. She was richly dressed in black, and ornamented all over with diamonds. As if unconsci- ous that fifty years had'robbed her bosom of its virgin outline and alabaster hues,she dressed in such a manner that it was half exposed, and there it was heaving, like a half-stagnant wave, with a heavy diamond necklace glittering over it. * At college we were wont to compare anything peculiarly indescribable to the "Devil before Day" and I certainly 'thought that, at last, I beheld that per- sonage in the female before me. "How d'ye do, my dear Van Warner? Up late last night at the opera, but thought I'd make an early call! How well you are looking! Bless me, is this your son? quite handsome, I vow! In- troduce me, Van Warner!" thus rattling on, in pretty good English, marked by a Spanish accent, she lifted her eye-glass, and surveyed me as coolly as though I had been a blood horse: "Elegant form, dark hair and whiskers, and quite the chivalresque cast of face. I vow, Frank, I'm in love with you already!" She spent the day with my father, conversing about matters connected with her estates in Jamaica and Cuba.   CIIAPTE R XIV. AND before the day had passed I had made up my, mind as to my future,-re- member, I am not writing a novel, but th pFla  - ir be, n) 'lniliting stgory onf A real life. I had solved to marry the Hon. Mrs. De. Wlf, Without money I could not protect Eva; my father was bankrupt, and the thought of the manner in which Eva had been sold, had destroy- ed not only the freshness of my princi- ples, but also of my nice sense of honor. I found myself compelled to look at the world, as a game, as a battle whose first word and whose last was "MONEY!" I consented to marry the widow. My prominent object, to possess Eva at all hazards, and keep her as my true wife, sacred, secret, and apart from the world; I married the widow, in order to obtain possession' of her forttine. I This was base, it will be said; but look at the ex- amples which I had around me, in high life; look at my father, deliberately sell- ing my betrothed wife into the arms of avarice and lust! I wish to spare myself, as far as possi- ble. a recital of the details of the dis- gusting mockery of my marriage. It took place in the mansion of Mrs. De Wolf; an aristocratic structure, furnished in oriental splendor. There was a marriage party and throngs of guests-the rich the fashionable of New-York. How I was envied! The husband of the rich widow, that is, the absolute possessor of half a million dollars! And then the bridal chamber, carpeted with the pro- duct of oriental looms, and lined with hangings of light crimson satin,--every- thing in it spoke of the immense wealth of my wife! The bridal bed with satin coverlet and a canopy whose folds re- sembled clouds of floating mist, seemed worthy of the holiest nuptials. Across the threshold of this chamber, as the sound of music and dancing was heard in the hall below, I led the trembling widow,--fair as the witch of Endor, modest as Messalina.  Hag! Would that I had strangled her on the thresh- hold! For two or three days after our mar- riage, her mansion, (now mine,) resound- ed with the echoes of one continued orgie, in which the light of day or the flaring gas, shone upon the faces of our guests, as they sat at dinner, or joined in   the dance, or drank deep of the rich wines from our cellar. What a page of "Ithe high I fe " in New-York was opened to me! Wealth, and beauty and fashion, were around me-this was the surface only--looking beneath the tinsel veil of the gay world, I beheld unmarried dam- sels of great beauty and wealth, who were virgins. in the same sense as the poor wretch of the side-walk; married women, of wealth and beauty, too, who had made a science of adultery; husbands,- who saw their own dishonor and winked at it; and libertines, who, clad with wealth, came from the brothel to haunts of " top- most fashion " to gratify their appetites. A very glittering and very' loathsome world. The fourth day after our marriage, having managed to escape from the loath- somecaresses of my " lady-wife," I was sitting alone in a distant room of our mansion, which had been fitted up as a library. My hands were in my pockets, my feet on the fender, my eyes centered on the fire-I was in a brown study.. My father entered; it was the first time I had met him' alone since the marriage. Dressed in the extreme of fashion, he seated himself by me, and slapped me on 'the'shoulder; "happy dog!" said he,- "married, settled in life, a capital of half a million-interest, $30,000 per year." "Happy dog i"I echoed. "By the bye, Frank, I forgot to ask you the particulars of your visit to that tenant, on the night of your arrival. I wished to cure you of your passion for little Eva. And knowing that the dear little girl had besought Walmer to per- mit her to. spend 'the -latter part of the wedding-day, and the first hours of the bridal evening, at her mother's house, I dispatched you there, so as you might see her, before Walmer came to take her home. Did you see her 7?" "I saw Eva." "Didn't you encounter Walimer?" "I did not. While sitting alone with Eva, la note came from   Mr. Walmer, stating that he had been obliged, by im- portant business, to leave for Havana ' that -ery afternoon."  "' The devil!" cried my father. "This 1 Se indeed odd!"  "He will be back in four or five weeks." i ^And Eva,. meanwhile, takes posses-  Rion of his mansion, eh? of course."'    '"Eva remains with her mother "I re- plied calmly, still keeping my feet an the fender. "But, why not go- at once to her hus- band's mansion?" said my father. For the first time in this interview, I turned and looked my father in the face. Cer- tainly, with his portly form, elegant blue coat with metal buttons, spotless  ruffles, florid face, and white hair, he was a well-preserved Iold man of the world.' As he looked at me with his eyeglass raised, I steadily returned .his glance, and said calmly: "Best of fathers!  In everything hitherto you have had your own way. You nmarried Eva to nmoney, and you have married your own son also to mo- ney. 'You have had your,own way hith- erto; allow me now to have mine. Eva . has not gone to Mr. Walmer's mansion, because she never intends to go there. Eva is to all purposes my wife, my only wife. And the wealth which I have gained by my bargain with the madam, I will devote to the comfort of, Eva, and especially to keeping her out of the reach of Mr. Walmer. And, best of fatherij make up your mind, at once, that you had better put your head among the live coals in that grate, than to attempt to cross, me." So saying, I took a cigar from ,the mantel and lighted it. My father did not- grow pale, but his face became spotted. he was speech- less. "But," said he at last, choking with rage, " suppose 'I inform your wife, the late Mrs. De Wolf, of all this?" "As you please, father," said I, smok- ing away. "Only remember, that such information will be considered by me in the light of a declaration of war." My father seized his hat and rushed from the room. As for me, dressing myself in a plain drab overcoat, and pulling a cap over my brows, I went stealthily from my big mansion, called a hack, and ordered the hackman to drive to the house near the avenue. I arrived there after dark. The place was lonely. and the sky, cov- ered with leaden clouds, gave an uncer- tain light to the surrounding space. I rang the bell. It was Eva herself who answered it; Eva, dressed in the same dress of plain white, with her rich brown hair, disposed in thick masses about her  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7091-00000022"/> face. Without a word she took my hand, And led me into the back parlor. It had been a week since I saw her last. She raised her beaming eyes and ra- diant face to me. '" O Frank, I am so glad t) see you!" she said, and placed her head against my breast. Certainly, I loved with that mingling of the intensely pure and the intensely passionate, which makes up the affection with which we regard an adored and yet respected wife. I took her on my knee, laid her cheek to mine, threaded my fingers through her hair-in short, committed all those fillies which are only follies wheha writ- ten or told again. Supremely happy in her presence, in the light of her eyes, I forgot the world-my dear father and hag-wife included. * "And your mother, Eva?" ' She has never been well since the day of father's deathl, nd has not slept for many nights. An hour ago, she sank tiato the first sleep which she has -had for days and nights." Hardly had the words passed from her. lips when a cry, short and piercing, re- sounded through the house: To follow Eva from the room, to ascend the narrow stairs, to pass with her into the sick chamber, was all the work of a few in- stants. Never shall I forget that scene! The sick woman, clad in her night- clothes, sat up in her couch, her eyes faming with delirium.  Her cheeks were hollowed; her black hair, streaked with gray, fell over her bared shoulders. it a glance, I saw that she was strug-' gling in the last agony. : "Eva! Frank!" she cried. We darted forward.-she looked at us long and anxiously-and then: joining our hands, r seemed about to speak, when her face changed and her eyes became fixed and glassy. She was dead even as she sat J up in the couch. Her last act had been i to join our -hands ; her last look was cast upon our faces.- * I remained ( with Eva until after midnieht., and then, 1 consigning her to the care of'the servant (a rough but kind-hearted Irish-woman), c I returned home. Said my " lady-wife" as we sat next i morning at breakfast--"You were not at the opera last night. dearest'?"  To which I replied, simply, "Dearest, 3 I was not." My lady-wifb's eves shot V fire.   As soon as possible I sought fin-fa - ther, and took him to my private room, and informed him of the decease of Eva's mother. "Will you attend the funeral "I asked. "Not in my way, Frank, not in my way. Leave it all to you. And, look you, :do what you please, I wont cross you. Only secure me an allowance from your estate: ; and," he put his mouth to my ear, ' be- tween Walmer and your wife, you have a hard card to play. Keep shady! For Walmer on his return will pick tp a law- suit, and as for your wife, she may make your coffee too strong. gad! quite: oo strong!"Having given this advice, with a wink and a chuckle. he promised -to apologize to my wife for my absence during the day. Towards evening that day, a heare, followed by a single carriage -took its way toward our family cemetery, soie ten miles from New-York, ina sheltered nook Cnear the Hudson. In the drear winter twilight, Eva and I joined hands above her mother's grave. As a :simple- hearted clergyman read the service, the words sighed mournfully among the withered branches; and through the in- tervals of the trees came a glimpse of the :broad Hudson, rolling in long waves, each wave tinted with the last glow of the departing day. * * I laccomaptsied Eva home. "Frank, you are all ihave in the world," she said, falling on my breast, as soon as we entered the house. O how the memory of that hour comes over me, as I write these words! Returning to my big house-I cannot say my home-toward midnight, I avoid- ed the presence of my wife (I can scarce- ly call her) and slept on the sofa, in the library. The next morning, at break- fast, she manifested her usual fondness for me, but there- was-a cold devilish glepam of suspicion in her eyes. But that day I redoubled my attentions, rode with her along Broadway in our grand car- riage, went with her at night to the opera, and then to a fashionable party. I had an object in this, which manifested itself at the breakfast table next morning. "Dearest, urgent business calls me away from you for a week or ten days, I must-nay, do not look angry--I'must visit Boston, on business of my fathier. And I must go to-day."   ( Fact, you mlust go, Frank," said my fther, who had just entered, dressed in his .usual, gay style--"Don't like to ask it of you, -but positively-my business will suffer if you don't go." After much persuasion my '; lady-wife i consented, and I went to Boston that day-that is to sav,figzratively. As a matter of fact, I bent my steps to the house near the avenue, where Eva wel- comed me, her eyes full of tears, but her heart swelling with joy. How shall f picturqethose days which I ,passed with Eva, in the house near the avenue! They were the days of my life. We were hidden from the world. No one knew, save my father, of my presence in New-York. And, secluded from the world, in the lonely-house, we forgot the world in each other's com- pany. Eva was mistress, wife, idol, to me. She was one of those rare women so hard/to describe, whose organizations combine the very extremes of the spir- itual and the passionate-whose minds mingle the simplicity of the child with the intuitions of mature woman. The thorough purity of her nature threw over 9ur mutual passion a chastened- and holy light. And while we were wrapped in this delicious dream, days and weeks passed away. One stormy evening, when  the -snow  lay deep upon the desolate region about our house, an incident took place which had an important bearing upon our fate. Wfre sat alone in the little front parlor; a comfortable fire was burning in the grate, and an astral lamp upon the table threw around a softened and mellow light. Eva, dressed in white, was Witting on the sofa, and I was seated upon a stool at her feet. My clasped hands rested on her lmees, and her little hand was placed gently on my head. As I looked up into her-clear tranquil eyes, and caught the magrnetismn of her gaze, at the same time that T pe- rused the bloom of her lips and cheeks, and the purity of her calm white brow, it seemed to me, that she was the most wondrously beautiful woman in all the world. We sat thus for a long time si- lent, enjoying the delight of each other's presence, and absorbed in one reverie. She at length broke the silence,- "Frank. I wish we dould die now!" she said. Her bosom heaved gently and tears came to her eyes.   "Why, Eva?" "We will never again be so iappy as now," she said ,-" we never can be hap- pier than we are now. And it seems to me good that we should die now, when our happiness is at the full." 'Twas a strange thought, and I had no- word in reply, but felt in my soul a ro- sponse to it. Then we again relapsed into our reverie, reverie so deep and so prolonged, that we did not hear the ring- ing of the door-bell, nor the sound of footsteps in the entry, nor the opening of the parlor door. But, startling like those who are suddenly awakened from a dream, we looked up and beheld our Irish servant in the doorway, and two persons, a lady and a gentleman standing near us, their garments covered with snow. CHAPTER- XV. ONE of these persons was a fat, elder- ly gentleman, with a bald head and florid face, small eyes, and a pug -nose. He was dressed in a -drab-colored overcoat or sack, and carried in one hand a gold- headed cane. The other was a short. broad lady, with a prominent hooked" nose; she was richly attired in a velvet cloak. I confess, as I looked at them over my shoulder, I heard bells and all sorts of noises in my ears. "My lady-wife!"I ejaculated. As for Eva, she uttered a short, quick scream: "Mr. Walmer!" she cried, and fainted on the sofa. It was, in a word, Mr. Walmer, who, by some devil's chance, had returned a week sooner than he had announced, and the late Mrs. Doe Wolf, my wife, whomn some similar devil's chance had brought into contact with Mr. Walmex  And there we were, Eva fainting, WaTlmer red and choked with rage, nmy lady-wife looking altogether like a fiend. It was embarrassing. "And this is Boston, is it, sir?" said the short. broad, ,West Indian madam. "And what in the devil are you doing here with my wife?" remarked the port- lyv man of Wall-street. Now, (I put it to thJe candor of everybody,) was not my position embarrassing? I felt it was, decidedly. I rose from the stool, passed my hand over my forehead, thought, and then, mly dourse decided upon, confront- ed the pair.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7091-00000023"/> "To what am I indebted for the honor of this visit?"I said, quite politely, at the same time winking at the servant woman, and making a quick, rapid ges- ture towards Eva. "' Scoundrel!" cried Mr. Walmer, "I return home, and find you alone with my wife!" "Villain!" said my lady-wife, "I think you are in Boston, and all the time you are here, consoling yourself with your mistress!" I quietly pulled out my watch. "You have both used certain words which are strikingly absurd. You speak of home, sir,--do you call this house your home? And you, madam, speak of mistress,- 'dare you apply that word to my cousin?" : advanced a step. ' I command you, madam, to return home at once; and as for you, sir"--I darted forward and twist- ed my hand in his collar, and in an in- stant had him fixed against the wall,- "I give you just half a second by the watch. to leave my house."  Decidedly I had hit upon acoup d'etat. For, as I sprang forward, the Irish ser- E vant took the opportunity to seize Eva , and bear her from the room and up stairs  to her own chamber, and my West Iu- cdian madam stood perfectly paralyzed i by my audacity.           I ' ' Villain! you are choking me,-you I shall pay for this,--you--" cried Mr. e Walmer, as he was helpless in my grasp. X "Will you leave the house?"I  re- ' sponded, 'tightening my grasp.    s Yes,-y-e-s," he gasped.      a I took my hand away; he put on his e hat and left the room; I followed him to c the front door. ATrrived there, he swore E awfully, threatening suits at law and search warrants, without  number. I r heard him without reply, and  waited d quietly on the threshold until he enter- c ed his carriage. Then returning to the h parlor I confronted madam.  She Was ti livid with suppressed rage.     t. "It is your turn now, my dear," I said, g pointing to the door. She fairly shook s( her fist in my face.         la "You shall pay for this-you shall a] pay for this," she screamed.     y "No  doubt, love,-no doubt.-every- n thing in the world has to be paid for. h, Good-night!"  And I bowed her to the w door, and out of the house, and -watched aq her until she entered the carriage. She pi shook her clenched land from the win- tl dov, and  the carriage rolled away  I nw .       " * r   )r closed the door, and went sadly up stairs At to Eva's chamber. I found the poor It child sobbing in the arms of the stout i- Irish servant, who was comforting her d and also swearing fervently at the s"Ma d gentleman wid de bald head " and " the "squat ould leddy wid a high head-dress," n --meaning Mr. Walmer and my Madam. ,  "O Frank, Frank! do not let them take "me front you," cried Eva, and fell sob- i bing on my  breast. * * Next morn- e ing early, I wasiat ,home in my grand , city mansion. I irttedYthe servant to ? inform the madam, th'at I would do my- self the honor of breakfasting with her. ' Then dressing myself with some care, I , retired to the library to awdit the hour, of breakfast. (' This 'morning, I solilo- -quized, ' Mr. Walmer will visit the house -near the avenue with a search-warrant," -and I laughed to myself. It was near eleven o'clock when the servant came,to announce that breakfast was ready ir the lilac room. As I de- scended to the breakfast room, I prepar- ed mysdlf to face my terrible wife.- "Now, for a grand explosion!" ,. Bujtjudge of my surprise when, enter- ing the lilac room-a neat little apart- ment, the walls covered with blue-colored paper, warmed .b+j.,Awood fire, and light- ed by a windo.01opening to the west- my lady-wife grdtced me with a cordial "good-morning, dear Frank."  Clad in a sumptuous wrapper, or robe of light blue cloth, with flowing sleeves, she was seat- ed at the breakfast table, her back to the curtained window. I took my seat op- posite. - Motioning to the solitary servant, to retire to the wiadow, beyond hearing distance, the madam filled my cup with coffee and handed it to me with one of her most gracious smiles, at the same time, leaning confidentially over the table, "Frank, do you know I made a great fool of myself last night? You see this old foorof a Walmer called here last night, and inflamed with a story about you secreting yourself with his young wife, and all that. He persuaded me to accompany him; you know' what happened at the house, and how angry I was. Well! coming   home in the carri- age with Walmer, I  discovered that this pretty little girl was your cousin indeed; that she was Walmer's wife only in name; and that he had no proof whatever   of improper relations between you. In fact, my dear Frank, I discovered that this Walmer had made me his dupe. But you'll forgive me, this once, dear Frank, wont you?' So bland was her manner, so cordial her accent, that I forgot her wicked little eyes and hooked nose. I almost thought the madam charming: "Your poor little orphan cousin, must come and see me. I can judge your feel- ings to each other. You are quite brother and sister, I vow. Take another cup, Frank!" ' I could not help thanking the madam for er kid const uction of m conduct, and handed her my cup. nShe unied it once more with the fragrant coffee, look- ing at me earnestly and keeping me en- gaged in conversation all the while. "Hknow I shall adore that dear little cousin of yours," she said, as she handed me the cup, and watched me as I raised it to my lips, her small black eyes glitter- ing like points of flame. At my lip, however, I held the cup but did not drink it. I called to the soli- tary servant, who stoo6bd by the window. "Come here, Marfe," I said. This ser- vant was an especial favorite with her mistress. Marie was a slender quadroon girl, with an elegant shape, brown com- plexion, jet black hair, and large, melan- choly black eyes. She was an exceedingly interesting and beautiful girl and, as has been said, was an especial favorite I with her mistress. Had Marie been herI own daughter, she could not have treat- ed her more kindly-indeed, there was a story, which had made its way from s the West Indies to New-York, that the I pretty quadroon was the daughter of the rich madam. "Come here, Marie," I said. And the t brown' girl came, and stood by the table, 1 and looked at me with her sad beautiful d eyes.     -  "It is a cold morning, my child, and ] you look chilled," said I. "Here is some E excellent coffee, prepared by my wife. I Drink it, Marie, it will do you good." c With a wondering look the girl took a the cup and raised it to her lips, and, J with a bound like a' tigress, and with a E scream like the cry of some other wild i beast. the madam  sprung from her chair I and dashed the cup to the floor. The frag- n :ments were scattered over the carpet.   And then panting, gaspg, , livid, the Madam sank back into her seat. and trembled, half fainting there, her white lips moving as though she wished to speak, but could not. "What all dis 'bout?" said Marie, making big eyes. "Go from the room," I said. She obey- ed. I rose, locked the door, and put the key in my pocket. "It is between you and me, madam," said I, approaching the speechless wo- man. "I will thank you for that little phial which you so adroitly conceal in the folds" of your right sleeve, and from which you poured a few drops into my couee.:. "I have no phial," she gasped, clasping her hands, and crouching in her chair. I made no more ado, but seizing her wrists with a firm grip, I drew from her right sleeve a small silver phial or flagon, which (as I afterwards discovered) con- tained a subtle and deadly poison. "Miserable woman! Worn out by long years of sensual excess, you pur- chased me in marriage, so that I might be the instrument of your appetites, or the cloak of your numerous 'amours Was this not enough? Are you not satisfied with having degraded me into whatI am? Why make me drink from the same phial as Mr. De Wolf. your second, and Mr. Cardenas, your first. husband? You would murder me, would Qou, be- ,jause I am guilty of preferring, to your- loathsome caresses, the love of a pure and stainless girl?" Hoarse with rage I stood over her- she crouching, trembling, and abject-in her chair. "Now, mark me! I will place this phial, together with a sealed affidavit of the facts of your attempt to poison me, in the possession of an eminent lawyer, with directions to break the seal, in case of my death.. I will so surround you with proofs of your guilt, that in case of my sudden death, you certainly will be tried for murdering me. Meanwhile,. I will control your fortune-appear in public as your affectionate husband-wink at your amours, so long as they are not too shameless-but I will not eat at the same table, nor share the same bed with you. Do you understand me, or shall I repeat my words?" "Her livid lips moved, but she could  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7091-00000024"/> -not frame a word. I unlocked the door; -Marie, the quadroon, had evidently been listening, for she stoodq pale and trem- bling, on the outside. "Come in, child," said I, leading her by the hand. "Your poor mother is not well. Go to her." And I left them together. 'From that time, the madam was as sub- missive and cowed as a tigress in a cage; 'Ft but that there was, at times, a light- ing up of her eyes, as though the tigress would like to make a spring. And, in the mean time, where was Eva? -Precisely'the question which Mr. Walmer asked when, on going to the house near the avenue, with an officer ant a search-warrant, he found that the o bird had-flown. His lawyer asked the batne question, in a portentous letter, 'well-flmaored with threats of a suit for abduction, and so forth, to which I re- plied bysa ,polite note, in which I blandly assured him that I knew nothing of the matter, but, at the same time, I advised him to go ahead, if he thought proper; and thenwhis son, a huge youth of twen- ty-five; -with knok-lknees and goggle eyes, came to see me at my city mansion, and demanded satisfaction. "Satisfaction for what?"I asked. i "For abducting my father's wife,"  said he. "Who will, allow me to ask. inherit t your fathers estate?" "I will, of course-sole heir,' was 7 the prompt reply.          1 "But will you be sole heir, in case i your parent is blessed with children by a a second wife?"           1 The young man had never thought of r that before; called me a good fellow c shook my hand, and went his way; and I t saw no more of him.         t But where wds Eva?   For months, Mr. Walmer surrounded me with spies. s tracked my footsteps every where, (so s he thought,) and discovered-nothing. t "Where have you got her?" said that b venerable man of the world, my father, i with a wink and a chuckle.  "Didn't si think that a young fellow, just from col- y lege, knew so much of the world. Where b have you got her?"         ]i To which I replied, in the most inno- h cent manner, yet with dignity, "Pardon tl me, Mr. Warner, but really, I do not h know to whom you refer."       P   ;  Whereat the gay old man made mouthA n and incredulous faces. And where was Eva? [t ^    CHAPTER XVI. IN a garden, near the Hudson River, stands a very pretty frame-house, two - stories high, with four rooms on a floor. ; Around the house is a grove of grand -old trees, whose branches (it is early s spring) mingle over the roof, and behind it is an abrupt cliff, backed by a thick 3wood. A more pretty or retired place cannot beimagined. Not ten miles from X New-York, difficult of access by land (for only a liarrow- footpath leading throujh .the wood, connects it with the main road,) and located on the borders of the glorious Hudsoni in sight of .the magnificent Palisades, this cottage seems the very place for a quiet student, who wishes to avoid the world. And now, in spring time, when the leaves are bud- ding, and the peach-tree in the garden is clad in blossoms, rich as a marriage vestment, and the gray old rocks begin to hide their grim faces behind flowering vines, why, certain), the cottage looks very. much like a stray piece of Eden. It is, indeed, the very place for a quiot stu- dent who wishes to avoid the world,- and, in fact. it is the resort or retreat of a quiet student, who, dressed in black (single-breasted frock coat), and looking very much like a young Jesuit, comes here, sometimes by day, but oftener by night. Strange to say, he does not often approach the cottage by the narrow path leading through the wood to the high road, but comes across the river in an oar-boat from the Jersey shore, as though he very much desired-to avoid the observation of an inquisitive world. It is an evening in spring; the sun has set; the moon is up in the cloudless sky, looking at hier face in the mirror of the broad Hudson; the air is full of the- breath of blossoms. The sound of oars is heard, and then the boat, bearing the solitary student, comes near the shore;- you can see his form, clad in sombre black, and a glimpse of his face, by the light of the moon. Arrived at the shore, he lands, fastens the boat, and passes through the garden toward the cottage, his gaze all the while fixed upon an up- per room, from which a light is shining,   At'the door le pauses, hind ligtetus-and tihe door is presently- opened by  -a pretty girl? No. But by a hard fea-t tured, strong-limbed Irish servint-wo man, who takes chargee f the cottage in the studentts absene, .and thinks the world of him, for he has been kind to her, and given her :money to pay the passage of her:two children from Ireland to the New World. "' Well, Peggy 1" says- the student. ' And is ityo, --masther der?" -re- pSies "Peggy, handing him a silver tandle- i6ik, pwhich 4ontoaips a lighted wax can-  die. The sttaqen o takes- the candle, and softly .ges up stairs,.and :enters the-up- per ltamber on the right, facing :the river.

The student places hiss candle -on the table, sinks into an armchair, and-resting his elbow on the arm of the chair and his cheek in his hand, falls into a reverie--his eyes grow fixed and dreamy.   The Jesuit to;t falls open, and you Adisover traces of gayer   attire :underneath--a blue meat, white 'vest, faultless 'shirt-bosom, and a diwt ond pin. So.!

'As 'I cr-ssed: thi Hudson riverin my boat, she-waved lit kerchief from the upper window,--I roan see her -now.! Arrived on the Jersey shore, I ascended the Paisades ;by -a winding road, found my horse at: a lone- ly farm-house, where I had been in the habit of leaving him; and mounting,-trode to Hoboken aad crossed to New-York. This I had done all spring and, summer, to  prevent my footsteps from  being tracked. At my large city mansion I met my madam--my rich wife. - "Will you not go with -me, dearest- ;Frank, to Mrs. Belblab's party to-night,?" said she, with great cordiality. I res- ipectfully excused myself. "'Have ano- ther engagement, my dear," said 1, 'Dan engagement which I can't put of:." From my   mansion I hastened to .the office of a celebrated doctor, and Secured  his services for the anticipated event. 1 gave hinm minuto directions as to the lo- cality of the cottage, and he promised to go out there in the afternoon alnd spend the night with us. To the doctr, in my half-Jesuit disguise, I represented myselt as Mr. Morton, a student of divinity. About an hour after I had left the doc- tor's office, and when I had changed .my attire for something  more fashionable  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7091-00000025"/> than the single-breasted ,coat of an eccle- siastic, I met that good man, my father, in Broadway.  "Where do you keep her?" said he, shutting one eye and pok- ing me in the ribs. "Now, there's no use in denying it. I know you've got her somewhere, but the question is, where?" It was night, when, crossing the Hud- son after, I sprang upon the shore, and with a beating heart approached the cottage door. The night was dark and gloomy, the moon obscured by masses of leaden clouds. All was silent within and around the cottage. No light, this time, shone from an upper window, nor did the rougfi-featured Irish servant ap- pear at the door to greet me with her ready welcome. Is it a wonder that all this filled me with a gloomy presenti- 3Aent? Trembling in every nerve, I opened the door. I hurried along the dark entry, and up the dark stairway. At the door of Eva's chamber I hesi- tated, with my hand upon the latch, afraid to enter, and find my dark presen- timent realized. At last I opened the door and entered.  A taper placed in the fireptace gave but a faint light to the room. barely disclosing the outlines of the bed, with its white coverlet, glim- mering dimly in the mirror, and flinging uncouth- shadows over the floor. All was   still-silent as the grave. 1 Agitated beyond measure, I went on tip-  toe over the carpet to the bed, where by the folds of the coverlet, I could faint- ] ly distinguish the outlines of a human ( form--"Eva is dead!"I gasped.   a A  shadow rose from a chair beside the E bed-in the dim light I could distinguish the slender frame  and kindly looks of i the good doctor. ' .  "Hush!" he whispered, and pressed E my hand. "Look there!"He pointed to the face upon the pillow-the face of a Eva, rosy with sleep, while her dark hair v escaped in rich masses from beneath her r white cap.  Not dead, but sleeping. I A could have shouted for joy.     S "Come here," said the doctor, and led n me to the fireplace, where, in the sha-y h dows, I  distinguished Peggy, sitting in a h chair, and holding something in her arms. r "Shure, Maisther, and it's a  boy!" h said Peggy, with a smile upon her face. is I could have hugged the stout servant in fi myjoy.                a:   -"Yop are a father, and your 'wife is , doing well," said the doctor, "but she p must, for a while, be kept quiet, away from the light and from all noise. I will a remain here until the nurse whom I have t engaged arrives. I expect her every , moment. I thanked the good doctor, by a hear- ty pressure of the hand, and then took I my place silently near the head of the bed, watching the beautiful countenance of my sleeping wife-my real wife-and glistening to her even and gentle respira- tion. In about an hour, she stirred in her sleep and unclosed her eyes, and gently spoke my name.   Oh, the pure rapture of that moment, when, irnp inp my kiss upon her forehead, I called her my -dear, my only wife, and she replied, her eyes swimming in :joy and tears, "You will love me always, will you not, dear husband?"2 In a little while the nurse arrived. As she entered the faintly-lighted room, she seemed to me like an immense bonnet and cap, to which was incidentally ap- pended the figure of a woman. The doc- tor gave her some instructions in a low voice, and then said"to me: "You will not need me again to-night. The nurse here will take all proper care of your wife ; and, as for yourself, you had better retire to rest, as your presence may. agitate our patient, and deprive her of needful repose." He departed, after having reiterated his instructions to the nurse, who had divested herself of her bonnet, and now appeared in a cap, whose dimensions were supernatural. "Good-night, Eva," I whispered, kiss- ing the rosy cheek of the young mother. "Don't you see, dearest, that all our pre- sentiments have proved false?" Then, leaving her to the care of Peggy and of the nurse with the phantom cap, I went, not to bed, but into the next room, in which the face of the Virgin Mary smiled from the wall. Seating my- self in the arm-chair, in the dark, I gave myself up to the silent enjoyment of my happiness. I forget the world-forgot how wicked and base I had been in raar- rying the rich- West Indian woman for, her money. "Eva is my true wife! Eva is .a mother!" was the thought which filled my soul. And thus I sat, silent and happy, while the night wore on, and   the 'moonlight, broken by flitting,clouds, came fitfully through the window cur- tains. "I will leave this rich wife of mine- S o ..er and her gold," was my thought, "and, with Eva and our child, seek a home, however lowly, in the distant West." And, thus musing, I fell asleep in the chair. From thatsleep I was startled by a frightful dream--a dream whose de- tails I couldn't remember, but which still left upon me an impression of incredible horror. It seemed to me that it was ac- companied by a low, gurgling cry, like the last sound uttered by a drowning man. ?started up and found that the morning had dawned. Its first rays were stealing through the -window-cur- tains. Anxious to erase the impression 'of the dream from my mind, I gently entered Eva's chamber. The rays of the morning shone 'into it brightly, and from the east. Peggy was near the fire- place, asleep in her chair, the babe upon her knees. I approached the bed, upon which the first light of morning softly shone. Here I would willingly drop the pen, but the story must be told. CHAPTER XV1[. THE head of Eva was thrown back upon the pillow, her throat and shoulders were bare, her face was distorted by agony, her lips apart, and her eyes glassy. And upon her white throat there were livid marks, like the print of fingers. She was dead; her cheak was scarcely cold-but she was dead. She had been choked to death. The spasm of her last agony was still upon her face. It was' her cry-that low gurgling sound-which I had heard in my dream. Maddened by that sight-the young mother dead upon her pillow-I still had presence of mind to pass to the fireplace and awake the servant from her slumber. As she opened her eyes and looked around with a sleepy stare, a new horror confronted me. The babe upon her knee was dead -the livid print of fingers was on its throat.            . T" he nurse," I gasped, " where is she . Woman! my wife and child have been murdered, and yet you sleep." I did not wait for flirther words, but hurried   from the room, and through every room in the house, in search of the nurse. She was no where to be found. Thenu sick at heart, I staggered into the open air, and examined the garden.  The wicket-gate of the path leading to the wood was open, and upon the soft earth I traced the print of a footstep-the mark of a woman's shoe, turned from the house. While I -stood gazing upon this footstep, a hand was laid upon my shoulder. Looking up, I beheld the slender frame and benevolent visage of the doctor. "I have come out thus early to rectify a queer mistake, which, somehow or other, was made last night. Yesterday, I succeeded in getting a nurse for your wife-a Mrs. Moulton, recommended to me by a brother physician. When I left my office yesterday afternoon, I told my student to send this Mrs. Moulton out here, as soon as she called. The nurse came, as you know, while'I was here last night; and I took her, of course, to be Mrs. Moulton, whom, per- sonally, I had never seen. Judge of my surprise, when, on returning to my offie, last night, I found the real Mrs. Moulton waiting for me there. It appears the one who first called at the office, and whom my student sent to this place, was a sham Mrs. Moulton. And I have come out at this early hour to clear up this mystery. For I don't like a patient of mine. to be entrusted to the care of a person whose qualifications I do not fully know. Bless me, how pale you look!" I silently motioned him to follow me, and led him into the house, and up the stairs, and into Eva's chamber. "There, doctor," said I, pointing to the corpse of poor Eva, "behold the con- sequences of your mistake." And as he sank back, perfectly appalled, I fell groan- ing and raving upon the form of my dead wife.- It was at least three hours before I could recover sufficient fortitude to con- verse, even with the appearance of calm- ness, with the doctor. We came to the same conclusion. Eva had been murder- ed by the nurse, who, taking the name of Mrs. Moulton, had obtained admittance in the chamber of my real wife. "And now, doctor," said I, with a husky voice and livid face, " as this has  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7091-00000026"/> been tie consequence, in some measure of your negligence, 1 demand of you that there shall be no coroner's inquest. Make out-what certificate yout please of the causes of Eva'A death, but let her be buried quietly andin peace. We must avoid all'publieity. The doctor was troubled; he had never done such a thing; but I was im- peative. ' By pursuing such a course we willbe enabled ,to discoverbhe murderess," said I; ' and when she i discovered, you may make the matter public." At length the doctor consented; and with a face ,tampedc with grief and hbor- rori and' a leaden step, left the house, promliingd to return. on the. morrow. "'Peggy, you  have heard what I said- to the doctor;"I said to the roughs featured Trish woman, Wvho wept-inces- santly.  "(Do you, also, promise to be silent, in order that I may discover the murderess of your mlistress?" Tihe good woman, lalf choked as she was bSy grief swore it on the cross.  Alndl now," said ., turning to the bed where Eva lay,I her liimbs composed, the I death spasm gone front her face, and her i dead babe in her arms--( Good-bye! thou i dearest and triuest of all the creaturt s of o God. Good-bye! nother and child. You both have left me. With you, all that is t good within me is dead.  And if I live. 1 it is not to enjoy life, or to love aeain a but, it is -- ."  I could sav no more, t but bowed my head over the face of my : dead witfe, and wept my tears upon her t face. And the poor Irish woman knelt t by the bed, and in her rough voice spoke s out a prayer of her church, for the souls t of the mother and child. When I again u ralised my head, my attention was attract- fs ed by- something bright which glittered on the pillow- -it was. a diamnond ring, h not miie, nor Evals, but had evidently sr fallen from. the hand of the, murderess. I regarded it for a long time, and then d secured it in my pocket-book.    it "Watch by the dead, to-night," I said di to the Irish woman, " early to-morrow I in will return."  Then. dressing myself in r fashionable attire,' I left the cottage pass- .in ed through the wood, and gained the high m road.   .  It was a cloudy autumnal day; the sky us leaden; the wind' howling mournfiully, te and whirling, the withered leaves high in :h   %e, air. AsI walked rapidly along tie hig at road-to the city, you may b e sure, th-a t. all the agony a nrn can feel, and, yet of live, was, tearing at my heartstrings. e Had it not been for the hope of ven- st geance, I verily believe I would have gone mad. Night had fallen, when, entering d the city, I directed my steps to my lofty I- :mansion. As I ascended. the steps, and traversed the- lofty hall; how different e were my feelings from yesterday. d   T "The madanl is. aut:!" one of the ser- Y vants infbrmed me: "Out in. the carriage on Broadway." 1  I hurried to the library, and on the - way encountered the pretty. quadroon , gir}, Marie. She, bad always regarded wme with, a singular mixture of- fearr and affection, since the morning of "the phial" scene. - Come here, Marie," and I. led her into the library, and  lighted a:;caadle. "Do you know  this Iing?T "Dat 'long to missus." said the brown girl, looking -at me with her big eyes. ' Name inside."- Holding the ring to the light, I discov- ered that the initials of the mnadam, the initia ls of the name which she had borne in her fir, ,t marrin;le, were indeed engia- ven on the inside. "I only asked, Marie, because I wish to present your mistress with a nmuch handsomer ring.  Now, go do wn stairs, and tell themn to have supper ready by the,time  madam  comes home."  -The girl left the library, and I sat down to- think.  A servaLnt soon came to announce that the madam had returned, and that supper was waiting for usi I looked in the glass, and  arranged my  attire. I' was startled by the ghastly pallor of my ,face. "This will not do; the pjirt which I have to play demands a,faceall gaietv and smiles."            ' '- I drew a, decantei from the closet. and drank ahalf tumbler of Madeira, and felt it flush my face in an nstant, although it did not produce the: least sensation of intoxication   Descending to the supper room,. -  found, an. elegant repast in wait- ing by the light, of wat candles; and the madam was there. richly dressed, her wig as black, her false teeth as whitej as usual. Her little black eyes, it seemed to me, shone with feverish lustre, and her cheeks were spread with an addition-   al. thickness of rouge; She greeted me warmnly, and I her with ease an4- gaiety. And we sat down to supper. How we talked.! Of; the opera, the lastparty, the newest scandal-who was to marry such a belle, and who such an exquisite would honor with his hand-how we talked-! Of anything and everything save the subject which was deepest in both- our hearts. And all the while, behind my richly-dressed, bejewelled madam, I saw the vision of a young mother, dead upon her'bed, with- her, dead baby on herf breast; After supper came wine; and we. drank each. other's health, and talked anid laughed, until. Maria, who waited by the table, watching us with her big eyes, could not help joining loudly in our mer- riment. At length, in perfect good hu- mor with herself, the madam retired to her chamber, and I went into the library. There I sat for a long time in silent thought. It was after midnight, when, candle in hand, I stole softly into thlb luxlurious chamber of the madami. -Locking the door, I drew a small table to the bedside, and placed upon its dark surface three objects-the lighted candle, a glass filled with Madeira, and the ring. I surveyed the madam as she slept, tunder her silver canopiy. She was wrap- ped in a night robe. fiinged with lace; a cap had taken the place of her wig, her false teeth lay upon the bureau.' A more luxuriously attired or uglier Roman I had never seen. I laid my hand upoh her shoulder: '"Get up, madam,'"I said in her ear. She started up, opened her eyes in sleepy wonder, as she clutched her night robe over her shoulders. "Frank! what's the matter?   she cried, her voice (from the absence of her teeth) hardly intelligible. And the sleepy wonder on-her face began to be succeeded by a look of vague terror. "The matter is, madam, that to-mor- row morning I will consign you to the hands of justice, as the murderess of my real and only wife. And I have come to inform you of it. so that you may prepare yourself to be dragged through the streets, like the felon that you are, with the mob hootfingvayourheels. O madam! do you know this ring?" Never shall I forget the 'dead, blank look., which; at my words, came over her   face. She clubbed her hands nervously, but had not a word in reply. ' This ring I found on, Eva's pillow, dearest," I continued. "And you ean now prepare yourself for the morrow! I did not think, of offering you a, glass, of wine, or of soothing you with-a few drops from the silver phial, but--." I tossed:the contents of the wineglass upon the ca*- pet, and regarded: her with a-look which she understood,--" but I believe you are in the habit of stilling your nerves-with morphine.  Try some morphine to- night, love. It will make you sleep well." And taking up the ring, I rose as if to leave the room. Then, clad-in her night- clothes, she sprang from the bed, and clutched me by the knees, offeriing me her fortune. everything, if I would only spare her life. "I don't -threaten your life, madam,n' I replied, shaking her grasp from my knees, ' I only speak of to-morrow, and advice rmorphine."  And taking up the ring, I left the room. But at the very door she again fell at my feet, clutched my knees, and held me back. ';Tale my fortune,  take all," she shricked, "only -spare my life. Spatre my life! my life!"  Her night-dress fell firom her shoulders, and her own. hair- black  streaked with  gray-streamed down her livid cheeks. 'Never have I' seen so terrible a picture of fright. I was touched,-I relented,-but a power over which I had no control suddenly pos- sessed me. "Woman! 1 do not take your life. I do .not condemn you. It is your first and your second husband; it is Eva and her child ewho condemn you. Address your prayers to them, not to me." And again I flung her from me. I left the roomn and closed the door; and watched without in the dark.  I heard her pace 'up and down, heard her sobs and groans, and ejaculations; and thus, perchance, two hours passed away. At length all was still within her cham- ber. Not a sound broke the dead quiet. I .went slowly to the library room, and sat before the firej in a sort of half stu- por, awaiting the  approach of dawna Dawn came at last, and there was a loud outcry and the sound of footsteps hurry- ing to and fro throughout the mansion; Marie rushed into the library, and  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7091-00000027"/> flung herself at my feet. " 0O Mq+tr ' O Master!" was all .she could say- ' Come! Come!"And clutching ine by the hands, she led me fromn the room and down stairs, into the bed-chamber of her mistress. The morning iighI shounegas y through the embroidered curtains, and a bird in a cage near the window was gaily singing, and-a corpse was suspend- ed from the canopy by a silken cord, the blackened face and startling eyeballs turned full to the light. I  CHAPTER XVIII. THE madam had preferred the rope to morphine, and she was dead. The second day from this event there were two. funerals in New-York.  The one, a gorgeous affair, went with a long procession of carriages to Greenwood; myself chief mourner. It was in the af- a ternoon thatI stood in front of the vault, surrounded  by the crowd of funeral i guests, and hid my face in my handker-  chief, as the parson read the service. and t the coffin, with the huge silver plate glit- E tering in the sunshine, was slowly low- V ered out of sight.  The  madam  had r "committed suicide in a fit of temporary insanity,"-such was the verdict of the i! coroner's jury; so said the papers; and g the parson, alluding to the fact, dwelt fi long and touchingly upon the holy life n and pure conscience of the deceased. At t this everybody observed me shake with a emotion as I covered my face with the handkerchief.  The other funeral took place at night, M or in the dusk of the evening. The Irish a servant woman, the good doctor, and my- tl self, were the only persons who stood S around the lonely grave, by the Hudson w River, in the still twilight. We buried at Eva-and her child beside her mother. cl And as the coffin, containing the young tl mother and her child, sank slowly out of sight, the Irish woman and the doctor fa wept like children.  As  for myself, I su could not weep. Gazing round the lone- I  ly graveyard, and upon the Hudson, rippling gently in the twilight, and upon ye the western sky, mellow andgolden with I ] the last kiss of day, I remembered,-O how vividly!-the last time that Eva and sn I  had stood side by side in this place. an "Do   you think," whispered the doc- po   rI tanr "th at the murderess of this noor -  child will ever be discovered?" by  "Doctor!"I answered, " the murder- nd ess has already gone to her account. Ler She was buried in Greenwood to-day." Uy lru'ur2;"I iU oI iu0usbli IAir the. ciGlj- Ia I found my good father waiting for me as in the library, dressed and perfumed as d- usual. d,  "Quite   an  afflicting  dispensation Is Frank," he said, trying his best to look grave. "How hard you took it in Green- wood to-day! Everybody remarked it! And now I suppose you are a disconso- late widower, worth some half a million dollars-! And,"-he glanced around the Lo room and lowered his voice,--"And she didn't make your coffee too strong for 'e you, after all, did she, boy?"Good old e man. g  The history of the next few mopths ; may be written in a few words.' I spent &amp;- a great part of the time at the cottage, t, musing, like one in a waking dream, upon d the irrevocable past. For hours without - changing myisosition, I would sit silently d gazing upon the bed in which Eva had - slept, upon the dress which she had - worn, upon the books which she had i read, upon her vacant chair. I  was  silttig  one  morning, late  in winter, in the -library-room of my 1 great town  mansion-my feet upon the tfender-my hands folded on my knees, I my eyes fixed vaguely on the fire--when tthe servant entered and announced that a Mr. Stebbins wished to see me. "Show him up," said I, and wondered who the deuce was -Mr. Stebbins, and what he wanted with me?"Can it be another lawyer 'from  Walmer, or any thing about my West India wife?"Mr. Stebbins entered-a  spare little man, with sharp features, thin gray whiskers, and gold spectacles. He dropped into a chair, holding his hat in both hands, as though it had been a dish. "I am," said he, without further pre- face, "I am one of the tellers of such and such a  bank." It was a bank in which I had deposited a large amount of money. "Well, Mr. Stebbins, I am glad to see you. I have not overdrawn my account, I  hope?"  Mr. Stebbnms  gave a kind of wintry smile. "  O no! sir. By no means, sir and he drew from his overcoat a large pocket-book. "Be so kind as to look at   that." He placed a check 4n my hands. It was a check for a hundred dollars, signed by my name, the signature so well done, that I hesitated ere I could satisfy myself that it was a forgery. 'Allow me to ask. Mr. MWrner,-is that your signature?"  And allow me to ask by whom was this check presented, and have you paid the money on- it?" "We have paid the money on it, and it was presented this morning by a mid- dle-sized, elderly man, in green spectacles and long gray hair. We paid the money, and the man left the' bank, and it was not until then, that some informality in the manner in which the check is drawn, caused us to doubt its genuineness. Is that your signature, sir?" For a moment I was buried in thought. It was not my signature-but I did not feel inclined to let loose the hounds of law at once upon the unknown poor devil who had forged nmy name. So I replied--"Really, Mr. Stebbins, I cannot at once decide. Yo(u perceive the check is not from my check-book-it -is written. not printed. This is suspicious; but I may at-some time have given this check. while absent from  home. It is dated some weeks back."  And I desired Mr. Stebbins to call at five o'clock in the evening, when I hoped to be able to speak definitely on the matter. With that white-heat malignity in his eyes which the mere mention of a forge- ' ry always calls up to the eyes of an offi- cer of a bank, Mr. Stebbins sat his hat square upon his head and departed.  -And I took my hat and cloak. and a strolled out upon Broadway, in order to i keep an appointment with a young artist of fine-genius, who was painting my por- I trait. This artist, whom I will call Carl- 1 ton-Louis Carlton-interested me deep- x y-.    ' Scarcely twenty-four, with long hair, I eyes full of fire, and a Raphael-like face, t he had already displayed proofs of the s highest genius. Some of his portraits - were worthy of the first artist in the f country; and he was engaged upon an c historical picture, which was stamped d with extraordinary invention and power. b Louis had made me his confidant. He a was poor-was  in love with an orphan C girl, whom he described as possessing the n rarest beauty., It was his ambition to 4   S. visit Italy, study there for a year or two, s, and then return home to marry, and to o achieve fame ald fortune. d  And, occupied as I was by the inevita- ble past of my own life, I could not help s feeling interested in the future of the young artist. In a few minutes after I s left my own house. I found myself in the i studio of the young artist--'a small room, lighted by a window which open- I ed to the west, and crowded with the - evidences of his craft. The sun shone s brightly upon an unfinished portrait on , the easel, but the place was deserted. Louis was not there. Flinging myself upon the sofa, I soon found my attention chalined by a picture which stood upon the wall-was it a portrait, or a fancy sketch? The face of a young girl, with sunny complexion, deep blue eyes, mass- es of golden hair, and a neck and half-re- vealed bosom worthy of Eve--was it a podtrait or a fancy sketch? I was ask- ing this question, when my ear was ar- rested by the sound of voices in an ad- joining room, separated from the studio by a door which was slightly opened; the sound of voices-a man's voice and a a woman's mingling in earnest conversa- tion. And my own name pronounced more than once, in tones tremulous with emotion, struck my ear. I rose, crept near the slightly opened door, and concealed myself in a corner, behind a faded screen. Thus placed, I could distinctly hear the conversation in the next room. "Oh! Louis, Louis! how could you do it!"It was a woman's voice, earnest and fiull of agony, yet very musical, vhich spoke these words. "I know not, Eveline, I know not!" returned the voice of Louis. ':I must have been mad! Here I was, with all my labor, over head and ears in debt- my things seized by the landlord-every prospect closed against me; and, added to this, the thought of you toiling like a slave at your needle, for bare bread-and -and-I must have been mad! To forge a check; to put to it the name of one who has been my best friend; to disguise myself and present it at the bank; to write felon on my forehead, and expose myself to a convict's doom! Oh! Eveline! Eveline! I must have been mad!" His voice grew husky with agony. I  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7091-00000028"/> could hear him sob, and could also hear the low voice of Eveline comforting him. "Louis, you were mad. You couldn't have been yourself. But all may yet be well." "Well!" he echoed, in frantic tones, r am I not a villain? Am I not certaini to be discovered and put to shame? No, Eveline, no! All will not be well! lMy life is blasted forever!" "'But, Louis!"I heard her low and gentle voice, ' why not see Mr. Warner himnself, and state the case to him, and throw- yourself upon his generosity? When his portrait is finished he will owe you at least a hundred dollars." "There it is! there it is!" broke in the voice of the artist, "I was too proud to ask him to advance me the money, but not too proud to forge his name." And again his voice died away in sobs. "But, go to him, Louis ;-go to him at at once, and all may yet be well!" :Presently, I heard his footstep, and w,'ihnim from my hiding-place, as he came from the front room into the studio. He was deathly pale, and his eyes were red with weeping. t"Wait, Eveline, wait until I return." He pulled his cap low over his brows, and. rushing by the screen which con- cealed me, left the room. Gliding gently from my hiding-place, I went into the front room. Eveline was seated upon the sofa, weeping. In her face I at once saw the original of the portrait. She was above the medium height, and her form, nobly and richly moulded, was clad to the throat in a plain black dress, which contrasted strongly with her clear complexion and golden hair. . If her glowing cheek and expansive bust showed a voluptuous or- ganization, her lip indicated pride, and her. forehead intellect. She rose, blush- ing, and yet with a stately air, as I en-- tered. "Mr. Warner!" she ejaculated. She knew me by the half-finished portrait in the studio. "The same, miss," I replied. Allow me the honor of a few minutes, conver- sation. ' To make matters brief, I will at once inform you that I overheard all that passed'between Louis and you a few moments ago." "And you will save him!" she cried,  with great flashing eyes and a glowing   cheek. As I gaZeg upon this beautiful creature, a feeli'g- cynicism altogether infernal possessed me. Perchance, the events of the last two or three months had warped my nature. At all events, as I saw the lovely girl blushing and tearful before me, I felt impelled to make her suffbr all that was in my power to inflict. "Miss Eveline, the- fate of Louis is in your hands." "In my hands?"5 "  It rests with you to decide whethere,- to-night, fireed from the charge offorgery, and with ample means to defray his ex- penses, he shall be on his way to Italy, or whether he shall, to:night, sleep in the Tombs." "It rests with me!" she slowly said, dropping her eyes. "With you!" and I whispered a few words, which brought burning blushes to her cheeks. "O shame! O shame! You cannot mean this; you are too generous-you-" "I am not generous. I am rich. I hold Louis in my -power. You are ex- ceedingly beautiful. You can save him. Will you? To-night, Louis will be on his way to Italy, and you will be -- "I whispered. the rest in her ear. "Or, if you decline tod save him, Louis, to- night, will sleep in the Tombs." $he i gave me a look. If looks could kill, that one would have struck me like lightning. CHAPTiER XIX. AND then again shame and anger fill- ed her bosom, her cheeks and eyes. "' Decide! the footstep of Louis is on the stairs! in a moment it will be too late! Quick, Miss Eveline, Italy or the Tombs!" What a look she gave me, as, halfris- ing, with a face pale as death, she gasp- ed "Italy i" and then sank back fainting upon the sofa. And the nextS instant Louis entered. He saw me, and without a word sank on a chair, and covered his face with his hands. "Not a word, Louis! I know all, and will save you!" "O sirm-" "No time is to be lost; not a moment. This afternoon at five I am to decide whether that check is genuine or a for- gery; and at four the steamer sails for   Liverpool. You must be on board of that steamer, prepared for your journey! to Italy. I will not only save you froml the consequences of the forgery, but will  advance you mTeants to support you fr' I two years abroad."      ' O generous man! How can I ever te- 1 pay you!"       . ,  "Not ,a \word, but pack up, pack up! and in your absence I will be as a guar- dian to your bride-thaLt is: your be- trothcd." At this moment Eveline revived from her fainting fit and heard my closing words. "' All is arranged," I cried. turning to her; "I Louis consents! Italy is the word!"Again that 1.ook! But' lremained with her and Louis until his trunks were packed, the needful money in his pocket, and everything ready for his departure. They had not a ehanoe to exchange a word alone. It Was three o'clock; the carriage which was to bear him to the steamer waited below; the moment of fatrewell had ar- fived. Louis flung -himtself into her ,arms: "Be true. Eveline--be true to me till death," he cried. She echoed his words-' True to you till death!" and looked over his shoulder into my ftce with that peculiar look. H stood with folded arms 'surveying thce scene. "'To your care. patron and,benefictor! do I commit her," cried Louis. There was another frantic enmbrace; and , tear- I ing her arms from his neck, he thurried frotm the room.  From the window I. saw him enter the carriage, and saw the  carriage- drive aaway. He was gone. I was alone iwith the proud and beautifull Eveline, who sat on .the sofa, now blush1- ', ing, and now pale as death.     ! "Now, mly dear ward!" saild I, brin'g'- ' ing her bonnet and cloak, " you will go honme with your guardianY."   She did not say a word, but put on her bonnet and cloak., and took my arm. I felt her i arm tremble, as \e left tie studio, dc- e scended the stairs, and pursued our wayv  along Broadway. She dropped her eil He over her face; I coultl iot trace the emo- 1 1 tions there, but I felt her shudder at  every step.             1; At length we reached my house. "I l have sent to your boarding-house for   ,your things. This house, in future shall be your home."  We entered the man- sion; I called the brown girl MaIie- : i'his lady, Marie, is your future mis- tress," T said; and then. tu'ning to Eve- line, who, veiled and sshuddering, stood in the centre of the large and gloomy parlor, I whispered.--"Do you still ad- here to your proimise. without equivoca- tion or thought of escape?" i do." was the answer in a broken voicec. I ; arie. conduct M3iss Eveline to her room. At five, miss, I will be pleased to see youl in this parlor, as the man with tLe check will call at that time." Eveline 'went slowly from the parlor; and I was alone. IWhat strange-thoughts possessed me! Here was a noble and beautiful girl, willing to sacrifice Herself to save her lover from a felon's cell. ; Wealth is power," I said. and laugh- ed to my self; and 1 emploved the next hour in sending certain of my servants in various directions, upon business of some monment connected with my plans. Five o'clock came, and with it Mr. Stebbins, whlose thin face glowed with positive delight as he seated himself in a chair near the table, upon which stood a wax candle, and at once unrolled the por- tentous pocket-book. "Ah! on the track of the villain-on the track of the villain! To-morrow we'll have him. sure,--eh?" lie stopped abruptly, as, for the first t1il ne, he perceived Eveline, who was seated upon the slfi in the shaldows of the parlor.  - *' This voung lady is' my ward, Mtr. Stebbins.' . You can speak feely in her presence. And. as he ran glibly on, I, leaning against the mantel, could mairk the agi- ta-tion of Eveline. \vhich every moment threatened to break forth in words. ; And so you are on the track of the villain, are you?" ;' On his track, on his track! You see we've discovered the store at which he bought the wig which he wore. lie is dtescribed as a young, genteel iman; and one of the notes--a $20 bill--which he rece!ved for the check. has been traced to the hands of the person to wholm be paid it away. To-morrow, Mr. War- ner---" Here Eveline bent forward, clasped  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7091-00000029"/> her hands, and uttered a low groan; she evidently suffered deeply. "To-morrow, Mr. Stebbins, you will say nothing of this affair," thus I inter- rupted him. "The -check was mine. You will pass it to my account. As to this story of the wig, that may or inay not be true; but the simple fact is thisl the check was genuine. I applaud your vigilance, Mr. Stebbins, but this time you have been grossly deceived, Good-even- ing, Mr. Stebbins." These words struck Mr. Stebbins with amazement. It was after a moment of dumb surprise, that he rolled up the pocket-book, bade me good-evening, and departed. I was alone with Eveline. I drew near to her: "Louis is safe and on his way to Italy!"I whispered, regard- ing her earnestly; she met my gaze, and trembled from head to foot. And yet, despite her pallor and her agitation, she was proudly beautiful. - "Have you no word of thanks?"I re- sumed, after a moment's pause. She raised her eyes; t4ey were filled with tears.  '- Oh! have )bou no mercy?" she cried, and slid from the sofa on her. : knees, and  bowed her head upon her t heaving Posom. -           1 "Is this your gratitude? is this your 3 fulfilment of your promise?"I cried in-  dignantly; "I saved your lover from a felon's cell upon one condition; and now you wish to evade that condition. You promised to be mine, and-without mar- riage.  I hold you to the fulfilment of 1 your promise."  - "O  sir, I have loved Louis, loved him t for years; alone in the world, we were  all in all to each other. All his plans m for the future were linked with my hap- t piness; the very crime  which he com- 1 mitted was done for my sake. And now, p that you have so generously rescued him m from ruin,-can you, Oh! can you, sink A his betrothed wife to eternal infamy?" t "  Once for all, Eveline, let me tell you u that such talk is vain." I raised her C from the floor.  "Awake from  your g world of romance into the real, practical 1 world-a world in which everything has y its price, and in -which nothing is given t] away. You speak of my  generosity. t] And how came it in my power to be gen- p erous? Do you know, woman?   By n selling myself, in a manner, a thousand fold more infamous than that in which h *-       *    e you are about to sacrifice yourself to serve your lover." I must have looked  1 like a devil. while uttering these words, for she shrank away from my gaze, cover-  ing her face with her hands. D "Come, Eveline--"I took her by the r hand and led her from the room and up , the stairs into a richly furnished cham- r ber, where a single light was burning be- fore a mirror. That mirror reflected our faces-mine, flushed with mad excite. ment-hers, framed in its golden hair, crimson and snow by turns, and start- lingly beautiful. She clung to my wrist with both hands, and, for the last time, regarded me with a look of overwhelm- ing entreaty. "Mercy!" she whispered. I pointed to a door which opened in- to an adjoining chamber!"Our bridal room, my love!" and led her toward the door. Her eyes roved wildly round the room. An object on the table in front of the mirror caught her gaze; she seiz- ed it and raised it glittering in the air. It was a poignard which I had left upon the table by chance or by design. "I will keep my promise," she said, in ' a low voice, but with a deathly resolu- tion. in her eyes. "I will sacrifice myself to you, but you shall not possess me living;" and she placed the point of the dagger to her bosom. CHAPTER XX. IT was a critical moment. I made no reply, but, stepping backward. light in hand, opened the door which' led into the next room. At the same moment I extinguished the light. Eveline, from where she stood, could see clearly into the next chamber, which was brilliantly lighted. She looked. The dagger drop- ped upon the floor, and she came for- ward and took me gently by the hand. And I led her into the next room, where two persons were waiting by a table, upon which was placed an open Bible. One of these persons was dressed in a gown and surplice-a fat, robust, easy- looking gentleman; and the other was a young man, with a face like Raphael, and the eye of a poet. "Doctor," I said to the clergyman, "I thank you for your punctuality," and, bowing to the young man, "Louis, behold your bride!" And the artist and maiden joined hands. While the ceremony was said,   his eyes turned deep with passion; her fad looked wild and startled, as though she thought herself in a dream. The ru- bicund clergyman pronounced them man and wife.    ^ "Louis, after you left for the steamer to-day, I discovered that it would not sail until to-morrow. I therefore sent' a servant to you, directing you to follow him to' this room, where I could meet you. Well! we have met. Are you satisfied. And you, Madam Carlton, are you satisfied?" Louis was too full to'speak; but, as for his young and beautiful wife, she dropped his hand, and came to me, and put her, arms about my neck, and kissed me on the cheeks and forehead,- "God bless you, generous man!" and turned again to her husband weeping. There was a long pause, in which not a word was said. At length, I led the way into another I room, where an elegant supper was spread. We all sat down; Louis and Eveline too happy to do justice to the  repast, while I slowly drank my wine ( and the portly clergyman ate and drank 1 as though there was a wager in the case. And the good gentleman and I sat over E our wine, longafter the bride and bride- 1 groom had retired to their chamber, and talked oteverything-politics, Puseyism, I "popery," the authorship of Junius, I whether Napoleon was a greater man a than Cromwell, et cetera, et cetera. t At last, being joyous with wine, the 1 good man went home in my   carriage a and I retired to the library, and-took a d segar.                h "Frank, my boy!"I said, as I watch- t ed the smoke curling to the ceiling, " you have done one good deed in your life. A M dev'lish odd way you took of doing it, a but still it was a good deed."   s] And the next morning I saw the hap- ii py couple on. board the steamer, Louis a( looking like a poet, and Eveline like an y empress; and, having received the last y adieu, returned to my home, wandered d sadly up to the library, and felt myself ei the loneliest mani in the world.  ir Soon after this my father died; cause. t1 too much terrapin, at an- aldermanic re- aR past, and I   was alone in the 'world. l Anxious to escape from my thoughts, I plunged into society. , I bought 'ne fast- 'is trotting  horses., T had my b',x at the h   r opera. I put my name among those who 1 got up big dinners to distinguished stran- - gers, managed mock funerals at the death of great men, and patronized rich church- es, art-unions, and the various societies for the promotion of humbug all over ; the world. I gave big dinners at my lcity palace. I lent money to needy fashionables. I gambled. In a word, I did everything that a man with half a Lmillion dollars can do, who is anxious to escape thinking. But it would not do. The ugly thought of my hag-wife, hang- ing by the silken cord, followed me everywhere; and poor Eva, with her dead baby on her breast, was always. be- fore my eyes. "What you might have been, Frank, if you had not sold yourself for money, or if your father had not sold Eva to the rich broker!" 'Twas an ugly thought; But I could not shake it off. And thus, one, two, three years wagged away. And while the years wagged on, spite of all my attempts to banish thought, a complete and all-overshadowing gloom took possession of me. The following words will but faintly give an idea of the state of my mind at this period: There is something terrible in that hour which brings to the heart a full- ness of despair-an utter listlessness in all the affairs of life-a conviction that there is no use to struggle and suffer longer-a sense of the utter futility of any and all kinds of effort-a settled disposition to brood upon the past, to hope not,in the future, and thus to wear the last elements of life away. ,  Loud-voiced suffering there is in the world that relieves itself in wild utter- ance, in alternate spasms of hope and de- spair, and in tears. But there is a suffer- ing- which is hard to bear. Quiet in its action, always with you, crowding upon you unbidden when you try to rouse e yourself to effort-coming  to you in dreams, and in dreams that call back everything of the past, and print their images even upon your waking hours- this kind of suffering -is hard to bear, and it wears, and wears the very life away. Oh! the bitter), bitter hour when, sat- isfied of the ingratitude- and misappre- hension of your tMlc.,-beings- vh-en,  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7091-00000030"/> hopeless of the future, and certain only that you are utterly isolated and alone- alone-all, all alone-you throw down your arms and give up the game of life, as a game that has gone against you, and -irrevocably. Then your existence itself becomes a sort of perpetual dream; you wander about the places and the memories of the past, and all the while feel that the chords of life are snapping one by one within you. And the hours you spend alone with yourself no human hand can paint, no human heart can sympathize with. You feel that you are an incarnate iso- lation, an incarnate despair-something that the lightnings have not killed but basted; you feel all the time the force of the ever-recurring question, "What bu- spess haveI here in this weary, weary life " And thus wear on the hours and days slowly, awfully, with leaden steps and memories that end all their lessons with an early death and a quiet grave. So broken down and wrecked by calamity upon ca- lamity, you sometimes fiel a kind of hor- rible joy in the thought that you have en- dured all that can be endured, and that another blow will break the last chord of endurance and of life. Oh! in this perpetual- though quiet agony, now anything that reminds you of'a happy home-the face, the voice of a pure woman, or a sinless child-how it merely increases your despair, and how, you know that, though these have once been yours-these, all the sacred images of home-yet never can they be again! And you can creep away to your lone- ly room, and measure the depths of your loneliness by contrasting the present with the past. From thoughts like these; from the dead apathy of despair which came with them, I was aroused by a personage whose history became suddenly and strangely connected with my own. Eu- GENIA! And' who was Eugenia, and how came her life to mingle with my own? Let me tell the story. CHAPTER XXI. "ET me tell how I first met Eugenia. One night I was sitting alone in one of the lanrest parlors of myv grand cityman-   sion. The servants had long ago retired, and the house, was still as a tomb. A wax candle, which stood on the table &amp;- fore me, shed its light for a few paces around the table, but left the other parts of the room veiled in uncertain twilight. The huge mirrors glittered faintly in the light, and the pictures on the wall-scrip- tural subjects from the hands of old masters-appeared in vague, almost dis- torted outlines. It was a night in early. spring, and a wood fire smoldered on the hearth. Seated in a chair by the table, my hands placed together, and my head sunken on my breast, I gazed vacantly and dreamily at the light, and was think- ing. My life came up to me in a sort of grotesque and nightmare panorama. The wild life I had lately led; the scenes of mad dissipation through which I had passed, in my effort to kill time and ban- ish thought; the images of the race- course, the ball-room, the opera, and the gambling hell; these were in the fore- ground of the picture which rose to my mind. And in the background was the sweet, holy facq of Eva, and the livid; dis- torted face of my hag-wife. I foundmy- self thinking aloud. "Frank, my boy! this will not do. You are getting old before your time. Your cheeks are sallow, and there is an ugly hollow underneath eacheye. The owner of half a million dollars, you ought to be happy! And yet you are not hap- py. The excitement of the gambling- table does not please. you. The music and the stir of the ball-room only bores you. Even fast-trotting horses have fail- ed to charm. As to the opera, and the routine of fashionable society, they are just better than being in jail, and that is all. Frank, my boy! you must occupy yourself in something-in something, no matter what-or this delicate centre of nerves' called the brain will tegin to be affected. What shall that somethinghe? Shall you dabble in literature, speculate in building lots, or-get married? Get married!"  A miniature of Eva, placed near the candle met my eye. "( No-I don't think we'll get married. Where is the woman who can fill the. place of Eva?"  As thus I sat alone, thinking aloud, the hours began to approach morning; and,   whether from causes purely physical, or from long-continued mental excitement, a nameless horror imperceptibly over- A shadowed me. I started in my chair, as though I had suddenly awoke from a dream. Sudden- ly, I felt myself terribly alone; I was afraid; afraid of I knew not what. Shud- dering and cold, I saw the face of my hag- wife, distorted by the throe of death, pass between me and the light-saw it visibly, palpably, and yet knew it to be nothing but a vision. And after this hideous face, there pass- ed slowly between me and the candle the face of Eva, her eyes fixed upon me with an indescribable look of sadness and re- proach. These faces passed and were gone, and came again. I rose slowly from my chair, and covered my eyes with my hands. The nameless horror para- lyzed me from head to foot. There was a. moment in which the agonies of ages seemed crowded into a focus-a moment in which the most awful fear that can af- flict a living man-the fear of INSANITY -took full possession of me. When I drew my hands away from my eyes, they were wet with the moisture which had suddenly bathed my forehead. And afraid to gaze upon the light, lest I should again behold those faces, I cast 'my eyes upon the mirror beyond it. Was this a new vision?. In the mir- ror, behind my own face, near my shoul- der, I beheld, distinctly drawn, another face--a face with its low forehead cover- ed with thick shaggy black hair, and its small dark eyes glittering like points of flame. Was this also a vision like the others? As I asked myself the question, I saw a hand rise above my face in the mirror, and that hand grasped a pistol, knife, or club-some weapon whose form I could not precisely determine. QPick as light- ing I turned-turned in time to receive A blow upon my left wrist, and the next instant had the intruder by the throat. There was a violent but brief struggle, in which thewhole room seemed to whirl around me; and when I saw clearly, I found myself with one knee planted upon the chest of the intruder, and one hand fixedi upon his throat. Panting for breath, even as he grasped in my clutch, I took a glance at the unknown. A young man, or boy of eighteen or v ,-             o '-^ . .-: *    I I   nineteen years, about the middle height, with a lithe, sinewy form, clad in a gray overcoat, set with huge horn buttons; &amp; swarthy face, with small nervous features, little fiery eyes, and a low forehead, ren- dered almost imperceptible by masses of black hair, thick and matted ;- such was the sight which met my gaze. "Well! you're pretty, whoever you are," I said, as soon as I could draw breath. "Young for a jail-bird. But you look the character." I took the pistols from his hand, and (without relaxing my grasp) placed it quietly on the chair behind me. "What have you to say for yourselft To what am I indebted for the honor of your company?" The youth replied with some difficul- ty, for my hand was athis throat: "Jest let me up; come now, you needn't strike a feller when he is down," and some other words of a deprecatory character. With the aid of a 'kerchief which I took from the breast pocket of his over- coat, I secured the youngman's arms by the wrists, and then, rising from his chest, told him oto get upand help himself to a chair. He rose, shook himself, looked anxious- ly toward the door, and then dropped into a chair, his countenance manifesting much sullen ferocity. A more perfect realization of the a - stract idea conveyed in the word " scamp" I never beheld. "Let us have a little private conversa- tion. If you attempt to rise from your ' chair, I shall be forced to'hurt you. Keep perfectly still, and letmie know, first of all, who you are; and, secondly, what was your errand here." "The youth replied in a pointed way: ' As to my name, it don't make any dif- f erence-it don't. As to what I came here for, you know as well as I do;" he pointed with his pinioned hands to the side-board; "gold plate there, and money in the house, so I heard. That's , what I come for." "And how did you get in?" "False keys," replied the young man, with refreshing brevity. "And did you intend to murder me, in ' order to get at my gold plate?" ,  Can't say as I did; only to make you a little sleepy, or something o' that sort." There was an amount of franknese  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7091-00000031"/> about tie young lnan which was quite en dearinr. ; N;w, have not you a good opinion of yourself? A young gentleman of your fine personal appearance, calculated to adorn any walk of city life, to plan a midnight robbery and murder." "Gas!" was the succinct reply of the youth. "Gas! What's the use of talk- in! I tried it, and you were too many fbr me. That's all." : And he sank his head doggedly on his breast, and refused to utter another word. In vain I plied him with ques- tions; he sat as motionless as though he were a piece of the chair or a part of the furniture of the room. i asked him as to his parentage, his condition in life, his motives for the commission of the rob- bery; but not a word could I wring from his lips. At last, I rose and se- cured his wrists by an additional ker- chief, and then tied his ankles together. He made no resistance. "Remain here for a moment, my young friend ' said I, "and I will endeavor to procure you more entertaining company." Still, he made no reply. I left the room and the house, and, in less than fifteen minutes, returned with a policeman-a stout individual, much enveloped in great coats, with a weather- bjaten face, a rich voice for crying oys- ters, and a very elaborate brass star. En-  tering the parlor, I found the young gen- tleman seated in the chair in the same attitude in which I had left him. "Take charge of this young person; I will appear and make complaint against  him to-morrow." The policeman stooped 1 and untied the ankles of the prisoner.  "Young gallus, I guess we'll travel!"  was his only remark, as he seized the youth by the shoulder. To which the youth replied by thrust- ing his tongue into one cheek, closing v one eye in an indescribable ,manner, and i repeating, emphatically, the monosylla- a ble, "Gas "! He was evidently a hopeless scamp. I saw them depart together, and bade I the policeman good-night; after which I t went up to the library room, and sat I down to meditate upon the events of the s night One good thing had resulted from the r unexpected visit of the hopeful youth; r it had completely banished the waking k   vision which, in terrible distinctness, had passed between me and the candle. * * In due time, the young man was tried in the proper court, by the name, (evi- dently not his own,) of John Smith. He appeared to have neither relations nor friends in the wide world. The same degeanor which he had observed in my parlor he wore in court, making various faces-all of an uncouth and ungraceful character-while I gave my testimony- asking the foreman of the jury, as he an- nounced the verdict of "guilty!", for a small portion of chewing tobacco, and interrupting the judge, in the midst of a moral lesson, with an inquiry by no means pertinent, whether he had ever ascertainedl the name of the individual who inflicted personal violence upon one William Patterson. In a word, he was a precocious and hopeless scamp, and did not seem to care half as much for the three years in the State Prison-inevitably before him- as a city alderman would for the loss of one hour's refreshment in the tea-room. I left him in court, his matted hair drawn low over his forehead, and his small eyes shining with more, than usual lustre. He was to be sentenced at some future day. Returning home, I soon for- got all about the matter. John Smith, his matted hair arid villanous eyes, his attempt at burglary and murder, and his three years in the State Prison, all faded from my memory, or were banished ra- ther by the sad memories of my own life. One evening, I was seated in the parlor reading, or attempting to read, by the light of a single candle, when the servant entered and announced that a person wished to see me. "She will not give her name--" "It is a lady, then?" "Yes, sir-deeply veiled-can't say whether she is old or young-quite a mysterious person-desires to see you alone-laid quite an emphasis on the word alone!" My curiosity was somewhat excited. I directed the liveried servant to show the lady into the parlor; and, after he retired, awaited her appearance in great suspense. A few minutes elapsed, and the lady entered, and took a seat near me, without a word. ' You wish to see me, madam! or-or-miss?"  (I did not know which to say.) "My name is Van   Warner." The lady made no reply. She did not lift her veil from her face. I con- fess I felt considerably embarrassed. She was darkly clad, about the medium height, and the black shawl which fell aside from her shoulders disclosed a bust which could not belong to any one but a young and beautiful woman. Her gloved hands, one of which 'grasped her veil, were exquisitely small. In a word, although her dress wore the appearance of respectable poverty, and her face was closely veiled, I was impressed that the woman who sat before me was not more than eighteen, and exceedingly beautiful. Again I broke the dead stillness: "You wish to see me miss, or-or-madam?" Por the first time she spoke. Oh! the taEe music of her voice! And as she spoke she slowly lifted her veil. The impression made upon me by that face disclosed by the slowly lifted veil, is upon me now, even as it was then, fresh and iivid, in all its wild fascination. "Oh! sir" were the first words which she said, "I beseech you save him, save my brother!" CHAPTER XXI. "YOUR brother!" I echoed; and, in the silence which ensued, rapidly perused the beautiful face before me, Would that the pen could do the office of the pencil Her complexion was clear brown, with lips and cheeks of vivid red-the very blossom and bloom of spotless and virginal loveliness. Her nose was slight- ly aquiline, her brows arched, her eyes large and oval-shaped, and of a color that trembled between the calm blue of noon- day andOthe brilliant darkness of mid- night. As for her hair, it was swept aside from her forehead in rich masses of jetty blackness. There was intellect in that face, and pride and passion, and a something which words cannot define, and which, until a later day, I was never able to analyze. The first effect of that face was like enchantment, it seized the eye and soul at once. "Your brother?" "My brother! Now in a-a-felon's coll, with the prospect of hopeless im- prisonment before him," she said, reach- ing her hands toward me and fixing her eyes full on my face. And at that mo- ment, the reality struck me that the *    face of the boy-burglar was but a cari- cature of the beautiful countenance on. which I gazed-one of those caricatures, of which the world has many examples, in which the face of an ugly brother' bears a vivid resemblance to the counte- nance of a beautiful sister. After she spoke, a pause of at least a minute ensued. Absorbed by the sight of her face, bewildered by the fascination of her loveliness, which seemed to encir- cle her like a presence and a veil of lights I knew not what to say. "Your brother," I faltered at last "has been convicted of burglary-wfi be Sentenced in a few days-how can I save him?" "Oh! sir-bad example, hardship, cor- rupt associations, have brought him to his present condition. He is not bad at heart. He may yet be redeemed from all his evil habits. But, in any case, save him from a fate worse than death- from the hopeless moral death of the State Prison." In her intensity she clasped her hands, and bent forward in her chair, her eyes centered upon my face.  "Would to heaven you had only ap- plied to me sooner!"I answered, in un- feigned distress. "Something might have been done. But I knew not that he had a friend in the world, much less a sister." These was a calm bitterness in her ac- cent as she interrupted me. "You knew that he had not a friend in the world? Alas! it is the way of the world! Had he been surrounded with friends you would have been merciful to him. But' reflect, sir, thus friendless and alone, he needed your forgiveness all the more." "But, why did you not appear be- fore?"I asked, somewhat hurt by the calm bitterness of her tone. "I did not see your face in court. You were not present in the hour of his trial!" She grew red and pale by turns, and I saw the veins of her white throat swell as with suppressed agitation: "Alas, alas! I could not be there, it was out of my power-utterly out of my power." And with evident signs of distress sh shaded her eyes with her hand. "But how can I save your brother now?"I said. "You have influence," she answered, without removing her gloved hand from  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7091-00000032"/> her eyes; " you have rich connections; you have wealth-and-" suddenly lift- ing her head, shi flung the full brightness of hir gaZe upon me,-" what is there that cannot be done by the aid of- wealth?" Her nether lip trembled-with a per- ceptible tremor, and she beat the carpet with her foot. For almoment I sat silent and bewildered, scarcely knowing whether the woman before me was a reality or the creation of a dream. At last I said, in a firm and measured tone,-"Your brother is to be sentenced the day after to-morrow. To-morrow I will do all I can for him. At all events, I will induce the judge to join with me in procuring your brother's pardon from the, governor." The words had scarcely fallen from me, ere she bounded from- her chair, seized my hand and. pressed it. to her lips. "God bless you! God bless. you 1' she cried, and then sank back: in, her chair, covering her face with her hands. and weeping. I could not help sharing her agitation. "Where shall I see you to-morrow to eommunicate to you the result of my exertions? I asked, anxious. to remove the embarrassment of the -momaet. "Shal I wait upon, you at. your home?" ("No-no--no PL she respondedquickly, and with an accent of indescribable bit- terness. "Notthere-not there!"She rose from her seat and gathered her shawl overher bust. "To-morrow night,. at this hour, I wiviwait upon, you here." She drew her veil over her face, and; without a sign or word Qfadieu hurried from the room. She was goneere I was aware of her intention to departs . Gone! leaving me absorbed and be- wildered by the vivid impression of her presence. For 'a few moments I sat silent and  wondering, and then, seizing my cap and cloak, hurried from the parlor and from the house, anxious to carry out an idea which had suddenly flashed- upon my brain. A strange, wild idea, ,which came upon me like an inspiration, and which urged me far from my mansion, resolved upon its immediate execution. I was absent from my house for hours. When I returned, it was late at night, and the candle in the parlor had burned   to the last gleam. Seating myself by the fireplace, where the coals among the ashes emitted an uncertain light, I gave myself up to the silent contemplation of the scenes I had beheld, the words 1 had heard since my departure from the man- sion some hours before. - And the con- templation harrowed me to the soul. "' Can it be that the scenes I have just witnessed are real? that the words which I have heard are anything but idle sounds heard in a dream? Can such things ex- ist, under the glittering mantle of New- York wealth and New-York luxury?" Thus. I found myself murmuring my thoughts aloud, by the dim fire-light. Alas! lasas! too well I knew that all I had witnessed that evening was sad reality. I had heard, I had seen. Did not the bitter truths of my own life render possi- ble the darkest and apparently the most improbable tragedies of every-day life? Still, what I had heard and seen (during my absence of a few hours) made me shudder at the very recollection. That night I slept but little. Next day was full of work, of hurry and incident for me. In the morning, I busied myself with the case of the boy-  burglar, and in the afternoon went to a private dinner-party, given by a jovial merchant-a fat round man of fifty, as -fond of his bottle as of a rise in stocks, with a shining bald head, set off by a few veteran gray hairs-to some eight or nine select guests. Fancy a snug little room, the curtains drawn, the champagne and hoc in ice, the fire burning cheerily in the grate, and (although the hour was early) some seven or eight wax candle% disposed along the white cloth of a well-loaded board. -It was altogether a bachelor's dinner; and, after the cloth was removed, :we disposed ourselves comfortably in our cushioned armchairs and began upon the wine; that is all, save me. For my- self, I had important reasons for keeping my head clear.. Among the guests there were two who  especially attracted my interest. One was. a man of the world, who, for rtwenty years had been a prominent ao- tor in New-York life, Burley Hayne, sometimes called Captain Hayne, whose tall form and 1broad shoulders were se- verely clad in black, with a heavy gold   chain across the dark satin waistcoat. Burley had been handsome, but now there were wrinkles about his protuber- ant eyes, and deeper and uglier wrinkles near the corners of his large mouth. His teeth were still good, and onlya few stray gray hairs (thanks, perchance, to Gou- reaud) appeared on his bushy dark whis- kers and thickly-curling black hair. Burley was a man of the world of a certain sort. He read nothing save a sporting paper. He was familiar with the niceties. of faro. He loved to eat good dinners-at the house of a wealthy fiend. He liked good, wine, and liked it best when it came from other people's cellars. He was a-duellist, too, and had killed his man on more occasions than one. Fashionable tailors looked up to, him, and rarely asked him for pay.. To cohplete his character, he was a bachelor, and looked upon womea with, not the most renome taint of platoaic or sentimental nosnse. Whether he had a sister I lnow not, utt certainily he had long forgotten that he ever had a mother: Such was Burle-y Hayne, who, easy and well-preservedl, sat opposite me, making the table roar with a few pages from the manifold adventures of his life -adventures which no- one- would think of telling within the golden covers of a New-Year's annual. I may remark that the gallant captain was deeply in my- debt for borrowed money. Beside Burley. listening to his jokeSi and; laughing * them in a shrill voice, was an older'nim* of the world, very tall and lean, with. i narrow forehead, hbag- gard face, and big- bloodshotten and fe- verish eyes. Dressed with much nicety, with high shirt collar, black stock and ruffled bo om, this gentleman, who may have been about fifty-he looked sixty-bore every appearance of a man of the world pret- ty thoroughly used up, and still with the feverish memories of past enjoyments burning in his bloodshot eyes. There was something pitiful in the way in which this antediluvian man of the world. called Col. Elephant Cloud, hung upon every accent of the fresher and more modern Captain Burley Hayne, A stranger could not help thinking, that, somehow or other, the captain held the colonel in his power.   Well, we sat at our wine, by the pleas ant light of the wax candles, and in the cheerful warmth of the fire; every faio from that of our jocund host, at the head of the table, to that of the cadav erous Colonel Eliphalet Cloud, convulsed with laughter as Burley related his ad- ventures-every face save mine. I was quiet and grave.; if I did laughi the laugh was forced and hollow. Perhaps the thought of my appointment in the evening with the sister of the young felon, kept me grave; perhaps.-well! perhaps-- Burley's adventures were of the most. interesting character. Now, it was a story of a race-course; now, of a  bling scen, into which. h head unexpect- edly happened ;.now, of a duel, in which he had, winged his maa-just betweenthe. eyes; and now, there was, a lady in the case-it. was always something, yqaint and very- rich. But the crowning story of the evening was about atroul-fishing excursion which Barley had taken the previous summer into some lake coun- try of a New-England, State. He had put up at the house of a quiet farmer, near the lake, and been made at home as a welcome guest, The farmer and his wife had an only daughter,.a rosy girl of seventeen. Burley staid a few week at the. house, trout-fishing and-making love. Time came for him to leave, and under promise: of marriage, he induced the farmer's pretty daughter, one night to leave. hen homw nd come with him to New-York. She cam  with hin and--- "Tbe. fact. is, gentlemen,!' continued Burley, shutting one eye, as he took a look at a candle through a long-necked glass, brimming with champagne, "she was so- rosy, so blooming. and so in- nocent, ao d--4  innocent, do. you know," he looked round withb an expres- sion of the most,. grotesque. serio-comic character,." that she actually expected me: to marry hert!" "Expected you to marry her!" echoed Col. Cloud in his shrill voice, and he fol- lowed his exclamation with a. screech of the shrilest laughter. Good! Egad! ; Ah!. What. next.?" [ The host at-the table. also laughed, and then looked grave, as though a little ,ashamed of his laughter; but, as; for the other guests, warm as they were. with wine, they made the room ring again,  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7091-00000033"/> "And what became of her, captain?" asked Col. Cloud, his haggard features twitching nervously, and his bloodshot eyes'shining with unusual feverishness -"What became of the dear little-lit- tle-robin red-breast?" The captain passed his hand through his bushy black hair, and made a grim- ace which showed at once the capacity of his mouth, and the whiteness of his teeth. "Well! the fact is, I lost sight of her for a month or two. You know these kind of adventures come and go, and a man soon forgets 'em. But I did meet her last night-" "Last night!" echoed the shrill old man of the world. "You would not have known her, by ---! you would not! My pretty coun- try girl had become a city lady! She was paler than when I first saw her on the farm, but her eyes were brighter, and she was draped in black, elegantly draped in black.- And she was-walk- ing Broadway! Egad, walking Broad- way!" "Walking Broadway!" cried Colonel Eliphalet Cloud. "They all come to that!" The room again rung with laughter;  the host, at the head of the table, did not laugh so loudly as before; as for my- 1 self, silent and grave, I sat quietly mark- 1 ing figures on. the' table with some wine  which I had spilt. My absent manner i was at lengthcremarked.      E "By,   ! What's the matter with X you?" inquired the captain, leaning over the table and fixing his protuberant eyes E upon me. "Have you got the blues, t Van Warner? You look as glum-as glum--               a "As an Egyptian mummy, unrolled X by Gliddon, for example," facetiously g cried Col. Cloud. "What are you thinking about, Van  Warner?' continued Burley Hayne. r "Of the story which you have just c told," I said, quietly; and as I spoke, somehow or other, a dead' silence fell I upon the company.         a "And what do you think about it?" a said the captain, rather pointedly, in his f deep, hoarse voice. "Why, captain," I returned, playing in an absent manner with the neck of a my glass, a great many words might be expended in developing my opinion of c   -- 7 'your story, but for the present I will confine myself to an expression of my opinion of you. Here, also, a great deal of eloquence might be wasted. I will therefore put my opinion in the sfmplest form and fewest words. Captain Burley Hayne --" "Well!" gasped the captain, very red in the face. "Captain Burley Hayne, you are a liar and a coward!" CHAPTER XXIII. THESE words, firmly pronounced, were followed by a dead stillness; the captain. from red, turned livid. He was a terri- ble man when excited, and was evident- ly struggling with his rage. "W-e-ll, by ---!" he gasped, and made a movement, as if about to rise from his chair. But I gave him no time. I dashed the contents of my glass full in his face; and then, with the words distinctly said. "A coward and a liar, Captain Burley Hayno!"I dashed the glass itself into his face, it striking him on the forehead, between the eyes, and splintering in frag- ments over the table. There was a silence like death and then an uproar like Babel. Never had I beheld a more terrible image of mad rage than Hayne presented as he rose to his feet, his forehead covered with blood and small fragments of broken glass. His rage choked him-he could not speak. "Gentlemn! gentlemen! this can be settled elsewhere," cried the host, from the head of the table. "Yes, gentlemen! gentlemen!" buzzed a half-dozen voices, "elsewhere! else- where! An affair of honor! No apolo- gy after this!-must fight!" At last the captain found voice, and his voice gradually grew more like the roar of a maddened buffalo than any other sound. "Elsewhere?" he roared, extending his huge, brawny arms, as though he was about to reach over the table, grasp me, and crush me to powder with his iron fists. "Elsewhere? No! now-now! -in this room!" And he made a movement, as though about to spring upon the table. "Captain Hayne," I said, slowly, "you can come on-and now!-but before you   can lay your hand upon me, I will lay you dead at my feet." I drew a small revolving pistol from the breast of my dress coat, and, stepping back a single step, covered the captain's forehead with a deliberate aim. Did this movement cow him?  He sank back into his chair, grating his teeth, so that the sound could be heard over the whole room. "Well, you must fight me!" he said, wiping the blood and frag- ments of glass from his forehead, " and I will kill you. That is all. Morgan, (to a gentleman on his left,) you will act as my friend?" "Clifton," said I, to a gentleman on my right, "I ask you to act as my friend. And, captain, take my word for it, I will meet and fight you where you please, but you will not kill me." Still holding the pistol, I'sat down. The scene was a mixture of a good deal of the serious and much of the funny. Clifton and Morgan, (both " fast" gen- tlemen of the world,) were already ar- ranging preliminaries in a corner; the host was pale as death; the other guests gazed first at me and then at Hayne, with much the look of men who have chanced into a powder magazine on the eve of an explosion; and as for Colonel Eliphalet Cloud, drawing nearer to the younger men of the world, to whom he looked up with mingled reverence and fear, he whispered, but not so low but that I- could hear him,-"You'll wing him, Burley, my boy! Between the eyes you'll wing him!" Burley pushed him gently aside, and then, looking over the table, said in a low voice, very hoarse and full of emo- tion,-"After what has passed, Mr. Van Warner, veryfew words can pass between us. We must fight, and I must kill you. But, once for all, I should like to know how I have ever harmed you? You are neither friend nor relation of this girl? How, then, have I harmed you?" Resting my elbows on the table and' my cheeks between my hands, I bent forward, and looked fixedly at the cap- tain, and said in a low voice,-"That, captain, I will tell you, after I have shot you and just before you die." Did I speak a mere bravado? Was there some cause of hatred between the captain and myself, other than his brutal story about the poor New-England girl?   Did I feel confident that I would be able to make good my words? The captain regarded me with a curi- ots look-a kind of mingled wonder, curiosity and hate-and then, rising from the chair, went to the fireplace, and leaned his head against the mantel.. The jovial host (not very jovial now) came near him, and whispered him, but the captain pushed him gently away. "Gentlemen," said the bland Morgan, "all is arranged." "A quiet field near Weehawk-time, to-morrow, near daybreak-weapons, pistols," added Clifton, the other fast man. "And, egad!" said the evil old man of the world, Col. Eliphalet Cloud, with an ominous twitch of his cadaverous lineaments, as he regarded me across the table--" he'll wing you, young man; he will!" In a little while the party broke up and I returned thoughtfully homeward, just as evening was gathering over the countless multitude of Broadway. Once in my home again, I awaited, the hour of my appointment with the sister of  the felon, in a state of feverish anxiety. The hour-eight o'clock-came. The candle was lighted on the centre-table- the fire burned brightly on the hearth- the parlor was silent and lonely. Seated near the table, with my eyes fixed on the door, I listened to every sound, and every instant expected the opening of the door and the appearance of the lady.. Half an hour after, the time transpired, and yet she came not. Had anything oc- curred to prevent her fulfilling 'her ap- pointment?  Could the scenes of the previous night which I had beheld, (and of which I will plainly speak in due time,) have pre- vented her from coming to my house? ' The lady whom you expected, sir" said the liveried servant, suddenly break- ing my reveries, as he opened the door; and across the threshold, thickly veiled, came the sister of the felon; thickly veiled, and the dark shawl gathered closely about her bust. As she sank into a seat she panted for breath, and looked nervously over her shoulder, like one who is afraid of being pursued. "You are faithful to your appoint- ment, miss," I said, breaking a long  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7091-00000034"/> panee. She did not remove her veil, nor could I discern a single feature' of her face, as she said-in a low, tremulous, but earnest voice,-"Andyou, sir! Oh have you been successful?" I had much to saay to her, but I knew not how to begin. "Ladly, I wish you to listen to me for a few moments, and to listen patiently, -" thus I spoke. "Before I inform you of the result of my endeavors in regard to your brother, I wish you to hear the details of an adventure connected with my own life" I paused-there was a movement of her veil. "Your own life!" she echoed, in a tone of deep sulprise.          I ' "Yes, my own life; and if you promise to be patient and hear me to the end, I ] will tell you the adventure."    ] "I promise," she said in a monotonous i tone, as though the subject did not con- 1 cern her in the least, and placed her  gloved hand languidly upon the table. I * Well, miss, one night in spring, not  many years ago, I was strolling along a Broadway, when I felt myself interested r in a young lady, dressed in black, and 1 found -myself unconsciously following in t her footsteps. A  glimpse of her face, a which I caught as she for a moment d paused in front of a store, and lifted her t veil, filled' me with an intense desire to I know her history.           t "Although she was very beautifil, there was care upon her face, and'traces s4 of some sad- dark history 'there; her n very attire, that of a lady of wealth and u taste, still wearing the marks of respec- table poverty, increased my  desire to M know more of her.  She entered -the ti store; unperceived I followed. It was It one of those stores where they sell rich ' embroidered work; and   while. I stood n near her, (apparently examining  some tl fine specimens of such work,) she drew g from  beneath her shawl a piece of em- I1 broidery which had cost her two weeks' labor, as she told the proprietor of the tl. store.  For this she received a small tr sum  in gold, say five dollars, which she bl olutched with an eager grasp, and hulr- d riedly left the store.        m "Still, I followed her."     in "Yonu followed her?" echoed the sis- ter of the felon, beating her hand gently yc against the table.          I   1,  "Followed her to her home in a dis. f tant part of'the city, into a lage house, i, (tenanted apparently by many'families,) ! and up four pair of stairs. Now, her home was composed of two rooms, and a rv small closet or anteroom, which con- municated with the main passage. Glid- r ing, unperceived, in her footsteps, I fol- r lowed her into this anteroom, and stood a in the darkness there, gazing, through i a small glass window, into one of the e rooms. I remained there for an hour, i or more. I heard much-saF  much." For a moment I paused; the young lady did not seem to manifest much in- terest in my story, her little hand still 1 beat the table; as for her face, I could not trace its emotions through her veil. "The room   which met my gaze was neatly but poorly furnished. The car- pet was faded; a miserable wood-stove stood near the wall; and a lady's work- basket, evidently the relic of happier days, stood upon the table, near the lighted candle. From  my place of con- cealment I saw  the young lady, as she approached the light, and flung her bon- net on the chair, and never saw so much loveliness, so much despair, combined in the same face. She gazed, wearily, around the room, and then, with a shud- der, staggered to the door which led into the second apartment. ' Oh! my God S I could hear her exclaim, where will all this end?'  "Even as she spoke, the door of the second apartment .opened, and an old man came forth, his haggard face betray- ing much agitation, his finger on his lips. ,' Hush! he is there!' I heard him whisper in a  low  voice, pointing cau- tiously to the room which he .had just left. I What money have you. child? We have been taking a quiet game, and must have wine. The wine store is at the corner; just put on your bonnet, and get us two bottles of the best champ gn, fleidsick brand, you will remember! "The poor girl placed the gold coin, the result of two weeks' labor, in his tremulous hand--he grasped it eagerly, but did not stir from her scat; rWhy do you not go, daughter' said the old man, evidently much surprised. ' He is in there, and will grow impatient.5 "'Sit down by me, father,' said the young lady, who had grown very pale. I want to sav a few words to you.'   "He sat down, wondering, and she said a few words. Oh! I heard every word!" The sister of the felon suffered her hand to drop upon her knee, as if she wished to avoid pressing it against her bosom, which now rose and fell, percep- tibly, beneath the folds of her shawl. 'You heard every word!" she said. in an almost inarticulate tone. "Heard her every word, heard the story of her life, and of the old man who tat beside her; how that old man, when a young and wealthy man, and liv- ing in a New-England town, had been deluded into evil courses while on a visit to New-York; how, from a wealthy and respected man, he became a gambler, squandered his wealth, the -fortune of his wife, the very bread and future of 'his little children; how he left that wife to die of a broken heart, and leftthe children friendless and motherless, to try -alone the hard battle of the %.oprld. He was never afterwards seenf in, is native town."  - ("What became of the children? One of them, a girl, grew up in the family of a stranger, and learned to get her bread by her needle. After toiling for years in her native town, she left that town and came to New-York, enger to find her brother. who had disappeared a year be- fore. in New-York she supported her- self virtuously by her needle, using all her efforts to 'discover ier lost brother, but'in vain. u And, father! I did not find my bro- ther,' she continued, as I stood listening in the anteroom, 'but you found me out, and made yourself known to me. For the first time in many years . saw you. You made your home with me.   Since the hour you first came here, six months ago. till now, I have worked for you, father, worked until 'now,--not to give you home and bread,-but worked night and day to supply you withl money for wine and for the gambling table. Fa- 'ther, I now tell you that I tan do so no longer '1  Her lifted finer, her pallid face, the calm, deep resolution of her tone, all took the old man by surprise. "Why, why,' faltered he, 'what is all this? Girl what's the matter. :' "' The matter is-father, that to-day, at last, I have found my brother '   1 "'Found your brother?' echoed the old man, withidiotic surprise. ' Where!' "' It matters not to relate, father, how I found him, but I will tell you where/ was her repO.  'I found him in the Tombs, in a felon's cell.' "She hid her face in her hands; the old man looked frightened and vacant, az though stupified by a heavy blow. "' And so, father!' continued the young lady, 'we will have no more cards, no more wine,--at least, while your son, my brother, wears the chains of a convict.' "Scarce had the words fallen from her lips, when the door of the second apart- ment again opened, and a second man came forth '  " Here I paused. "Shall I go on?"I said to the young lady, who sat statue-like before me. .Her !ands had fallen helplessly to her side. Her veiled face was slightly dropped to her bosom. "Go on, go!" she said, in a scarce ar- ticulate voice,--"Do not mind me! Do not mind me; go on!" "A second man came forth-a man whom I recognized at a glan6e as one of the notorious men of New-York. I saw him approach the young lady, heard him call her by her proper name. She rose from her seat; I could not see her face, but saw her shrink away firom him, step by step, as though he had been a nox- ious reptile. "Again I heard him familiarly call her by name. :- v You need not be'afraid of me/ he said, in his hoarse voice, 'the partition is thin. in fact, I was listening; and heard all-all. Don't you see addition- al reason for complying with the propo- sition which I made to your father a month ago? Do this and I will save your brother, and lift your father from this miserable place to comfort-affluence.' He stopped as if awaiting for her reply. She gave it promptly, CHAPTER XXIV. is THS promise of comfort-afflu- ence, comes from a gentleman who for months has not hesitated to drink wine and play at cards from the hard earnings ,of a poor girl-a gentleman who has played upon the fears and tremors of an old man, in order to rob him, and who has  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7091-00000035"/> used his power over that old man in the attempt to corrupt his daughter.' "These words seemed to sting the gambler to the quick. ;   ," 'Well, my lady,' he cried fiercely, ' do as you please. Only remember- that I hold a paper, to which your father some- time ago had the indiscretion to sign another man's name.' "This threat evidently terrified the young girl; it struck the old man with ' fear and trembling.' "As for the gambler, he took his hat and cloak, and left the room without an- other word. He brushed past me as I stood concealed in the anteroom. I only remained a moment longer there. Gazing through the glass, I saw the young girl standing with clasped hands and pallid face-despair in every line of that face. "Daughter,' I heard the old man say. you must consent.' To which came the reply- "' Do you think so, father? O would,  in the hour that you broke my mother's - heart, that you had completed your work, i and killed your children! thus saving I your son from a convict's chains, and i your daughter from   .' She stop- i ped and hid her face. I heard and saw  no more." My story was done. I looked upon c the veiled woman who sat: before me,  anxious to discover what effect it had t upon her. Gathering her hands from s her side, she pressed them violently to her bosom, for an instant only, and then a flung up her veil. Pale, very pale, was li that beautiful face; but there was firm- h ness in'the compressed lips--there was wild fire in the eyes. There wasta swell- a: ing of the muscles of the throat, a heav- ing of the bosom palpable through the w thick shawl which covered it; and then, tl leaning forward, and fixing her gaze full to upon me, she said,-"And you saw and e3 heard all-you." She put her hand to tl her'throatas if her utterance was choked. m "Yes, I saw and heard all," was my It reply. "Yes, EUGENIA CLOUD! and be- fo fore this time to-morrow Captain BUR- m "EY HAYNE Will meet his death by my hand." There is no language to depict the ef- be fect which these words had upon her. ui Her face lighted up with a strange, wild fo: look, as though a flash of lightning had pu passed over it.           we   he  "You-you--you!" she seized my hands and wrung them in her own- he " you will save my father from this man; you-will save him--" So  "Captain Burley Hayne shall surren- I der the paper, by which he holds your e- father in his power, or he will meet his ,n death at my hand." She resumed her seat. ie  "Cannot my father be saved without h bloodshed?" she said, in a voice of deep sadness. "Must one crime be avoided it only by another crime? If you"-she l- shuddered--"if you kill him it will be I --murder, and you will have to fly. And y then-." She hesited, and fixed her g gaze upon me with a look which I could ,i not define. d  -"Captain Burley Hayne has been long enough abroad.. It is a crime to take , life, but not a crime to take a life like ehis-to prevent him from the commission of a thousand crimes worse than mur- , der. I may have to fly," I continued, S as though thinking aloud. "Well, be it so.  I will save you. My life itself is a wreck.  There is no living thing to care for me.  Come flight, disgrace, the siig- ma of murderer! so that I can only save you!" "But," and the color glowed warmly over her throat and face, "he is a practiped duellist. He way kill you-." Her look, the tremor which agitated her frame, said more than her words. What strange thought was this which, at her look, began to take shape and rise like a phantom frdm the depths of my heart?  I crushed it as I rose, and said calmly and bitterly-- "Eugenia, my   life, I repeat it, is a wreck. I survey my wealth, I wander through the lonely rooms of this grand mansion. I essay every pleasure, try every experiment of Work and pleasure which the world offers to me, and, after all, find myself only a solitary and blasted man. It may end the sorrows, it may atone for the crimes of a life like mine, to spend my blood in a cause so holy as yours." I spoke not in affectation of sentiment or heroism, nor in the spirit of bravado, but from an impulse which was as strong upon me at this moment, as it had been for the last twenty-four hours-an im- pulse which I cannot define even if I would.   I rose and paced the floor, now in light, Aow in shadow. As, after a long silence, I turned in my walk, Eugenia confronted me, her face turned from the light, her hand ex- tended. "7t1his .must not be,) she said, in a firm, although tremulous voice,--"You must not peril your life for me. Save mry poor brother from a felon's chains- it is all I dare ask! As for myself, I have struggled against misfortunes thus far-I can struggle still-and if the worst comes-- " -" "If the worst comes, you can marry Captain Burley Hayne, and become, not only his wife, but the instrument of new impostures upon society, planned by him."           * She drew nearer to me, and, to my sur- prise, put her hand upon my shoulder; her eyes flashed as if all her soul was in their light. "Marry Captain Hayne-marry him? Is it fair, is it generous, is it manly. for you to use your knowledge of!Ly posi- tion in order to insult me 'thus? Marry him?   No; if the worst comes, I can- die." Her hand trembled as it touched my shoulder; her face'was very near mine; the alternate glow and pallor of her face; the vivid brightness of her eyes; the clear, calm resolution of her forehead, all were before and very near me, and the magnet- ism of her presence was around and about me. ' No! Eugenia, you shall not die!, Your life is worth a thousand such as  mine.- Last night, as I saw you at your home, and listened to you there, it seem- f ed to me as if I had known you from . very childhood. I then determined to 1 peril all, dare all, for you; and I will do s it." ) She interrupted me. What power was t there in the words she said?  They i changed the course of my life. Let others moralize; I only state facts,    ' "Live, then, for my sake," she said, her 1 face -so near me that her breath was on 1 my cheek, and &amp;er head drooped forward 3 until it rested against my breast, her I hand still trembling on my shoulder. At I her words the dark way of my life seem- I ed  suddehly lit up with light from X heaven! I stood like one entranced. N "Live for my sake!" she whiwprcd, t 5   ;, raising her face; her eyes were all the brighter for their tears. Let me be your a sister! Let me still continue my hum- r ble way of life, but be near you always, - in sorrow and in danger! When all is well with you. in your rich home, then I X will keep apart; but when sorrow comes, i and you need consolation and the pres- 3 ence of one true to you, as sister to dear- - est brother, then I will be with you!" Why did something in her words grate ; horribly bn my soul? "Sister-never!"I echoed; and put my hand gently on her forehead, and bent down to her face. "On one condition I promise not to peril my own life,. not to shed the blood of Captain Hayne. Be my wife." " Never! It cannot be! The world would say I became yours for your wealth. I am not worthy of you. My brother a convict; my father--oh! you know what he is! Your wife! Never- never!" "It is well, Eugenia. You have pro- nounced my fate," I said, coldly; and, taking her hand from my shoulder, walk- ed into the shadows of the parlor. When I turned again, she was stand- ing where I left her. her hands joined in front of her form, - er eyes absent and dreamy. Although the shadow was on her face, it was plainly to be seen that she was terribly agitated. ' "Your brother, in consideration ofhis youth, and of representations made by myself and the judge, will receive his ,pardon before Saturday"-I began, en- deavoring to assume a calm. "Oh! I know not what to do!" she said, as though  speaking to herself. "For years denied the blessing of a mo- ther's counsel and a mother's love, I have struggled on alone. Marry! It will be said I sold myself for wealth. The dis- grace attached to my family will attach itself to him." "Eugenia," said I; drawing near to her, "I was wrong to present to you such a hideous alternative as marriage or- bloodshed. Forgive me. And then, as your hand was on my shoulder, as your breath was on my cheek, I forgot that I must meet the captain to-morrow, fight him, or be disgraced forever. I must meet him-fight  him-there is no other way.  Let me beg you to allow matters to take their clKrsa  Return home, and  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7091-00000036"/> hope for the best. In any case, your bro- ther will be pardoned, and whatever is the eventof to-morrow, you will be saved from all chance-(of poverty I was about to add, but I said)-from all chance of harm." .  Was it merely surprise that mantled over her face? OrI did she by an almost supernatural effort, regain her compo- sure? After a moment's thought she bade me "good-evening!" in a calm voice, and turned toward the door.  There she seemed to linger as if in hesitation, but it was for a moment only. She opened the door; she did not once look back; she crossed the threshold. I stood gazing upon the space made black and vacant by her departure. But in an instant there was a wild cry, and the sound of rapid footsteps; there were arms out- stretched, and a woman's voice, speaking in broken impetuous tones; and-a wo- man's face pillowed on my breast. The blank space left by her departure was filled again and shining with heavenly light. And words, scarce articulate for sobs and tears, said to me:  Avoid bloodshed! avoid crime!-I will be your wife!" It is a pitiful thing that, while the 1 dark passages of every life may be de-  scribed, the best and holiest moments that brighten the drear way of this a world are too pure, too sacred, to be told A again. Over the joy of that moment. E w-hen, in the dimly-lighted parlor.

Her g father was not there; he was, in all prob- n ability, in the company of Captain Hayne, rx helping to arrange "the preliminaries S of the morrow's duel. I left her at the r threshold.             tU "1 Remember your promise-at all haz- pi ards, avoid bloodshed!"    "    o-  I raised her gloved hand to my lips, is and left her in the doorway, one side of d -her beautiful face touched by the light it which shone from within. "Shall I ever of see her again?" the thought came pp. ugly and almost palpable, a}I went down d the dark stairway. Avoid bloodshed- ;t how? Stung by the persecution which I- had seen Eugenia suffer from the cap- tain; disgusted by the shameless acts e which stained his whole career; reckless d of my own existence; driven forward by e an impulse which I could not control, I t had planned, I had executed the scene e of the dinner-table. The captain bore emy mark upon his forehead. A challenge had passed; a duel would take place to- t morrow; just after dinner-how avoid t bloodshed? "If I fire in the air, the captain will - shoot me if I do not fire in the air, I will shoot him! Bloodshed must be -avoided; for now I have something to live for; but how shall it be avoided?" Thus -I cogitated as I strolled down Broadway. CHAPTER XXV. "How shall I avoid bloodshed?" was the question which troubled me as I strolled down Broadway. I put my hand upon my vest pocket and felt a small piece of manuscript, which I had carried there for a month and more--a very precious manuscript which a mercantile friend of mine, Mr. Jardine, of undoubted character, had given me as an equivalent for the sum of five hundred and fifty dollars. It was, in a word, a check, signed by a promi- nent firm in New-York, Firkin &amp; Smal- ley, and given to my mercantile friend aforesaid, by a strange gentleman of plau- sible manners, in exchange for certain wines of highest price and rarest flavor. After receiving this check, I had, in due time, presented it to Messrs. Firkin &amp; Smalley at their counter, instead of going to their bank at once, and, with a good deal'of indignation, they had pro- nounced it a forgery. I begged them to remain quiet in the matter, and made the same request to Mr. Jardine. Thus a month or more passed away. During this month, aided by Mr. Jardine, and a police officer, who looked as demure as a country parson, but was in fact as cun-   ning as any fox in Esop, I had amused Iny leisure hours in the attempt to dis- cover the plausible stranger who had pre- sented the check. Had I succeeded? Some foui days ago my investigation came to a close. That was before I knew anything of Eugenia or her brother. And those investigations all terminated at the door of a certain gentleman, fash- ionable in his address, and (when the humor seizes him) most plausible in his manners. Well! The paper is safe! Shall I use it? That was a very nice question. That little bit of paper properly used, and- there would be no duel on the morrow. Gentlemen who occupy apartments in that elegant public hotel known as the Tombs, are not precisely at liberty to walk abroad, much less to fight duels. But would it be honorable in me to invoke the aid of the magical little frag- ment of paper, which bore on one corner, in elegant numerals, the representation of five hundred and fifty dollars, and in another, the mercantile scrawl of Firkin &amp; Smalley? Honorable? On the other hand, would it be honor- able for me to stand up in single com- bat against a professed duellist. ambler. debanchee; and who, to his other cardi- nal virtues, had lately added the unob- trusive practice' of-forgery? A very nice question, look at it as you will. Much troubled by this delicate ques- tion, I strolled down Broadway, and un- consciously approached the Park. The night had. grown cloudy, and something between a fog and a drizzle obscured the lamps in the Park. The leafless trees arose, grotesque and vague in the misty air. Broadway was almost deserted. A single personf stood at the corner of a street which extends from Broadway toward the North River-a very demure-looking person, with sad- colored clothes, an imperturbable coun-' tennce, and a white cravat. I approached this person; it was the particular police officer, whom I will call Mr. Pittson. "Ah! is that you, Mr. Van Warner? You are out rather late. Coming home from the opera, I suppose 7" "And you-what do you out so late, Mr. Pittson?" that gentleman extended his hand, and pointed down the street which led towards the North River.   All was dark there; the street lamps had been. extinguished; the only thing which relieved the gloom was a light which shone from an upper room of a four-storied mansion. "A fine light, that. [ have been watching it," said Mr. Pittson. quietly. '"There's something very interesting in that light, Mr. Van Warner." The room from which the light shone was in the fourth story of a large edifice. The ground floor, and second and third stories, were used for mercantile purpo- ses, alive all day with the' hum of busi- ness, but at night silent as a tomb. The rooms in the fourth story, silent all day, were always at night, especially late at night, lighted up as if for a festival. Late at night, low music broke the silence of these rooms-music so low that it could only be heard by 'a practised ear-the soft rustling of small pieces of pasteboard, and the sharp quick rattling of ivory balls. These rooms, in a word, were the resi- dence and the secret temple of Captain Burley Hayne. "He is there now, I guess," whispered Pittson. "Aint it about time 1o give him a call?" "You remember your promise, Pitt- son-this matter is entirely in my-hahds. You will not take a single step without my. consent?" "Of course," emphatically responded Pittson, arranging his white cravat. "Well, I wish to have a few words in private with Captain Hayne. I will as- cend to his room. You will, follow me, and station yourself in the dark outside of his door. And, when I call your name, you will enter the room, and pro- ceed as I may direct. You comprehend?" "I do," was his prompt reply, uttered by Pittson with a peculiar twinkle of his sharp eyes. And I went down the street; and stealthily, some twenty paces after me, came Pittson, his India rubber shoes giving not the slightest echo of a foot- step. As I ascended in the dark to- ward the captain's rooms, I had by no means decided upon the course which I was to pursue. Arrest him, in order to avoid the duel? I did not like the thought. Force him to sign a paper in which he  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7091-00000037"/> will confess that he was justly assaulted, and decline to meet me in single combat? The latter looked more plausible, but I knew not which course to take. ' T will see him first, and leave the result to chance," I muttered, as I stood in the dark at the captain's door. Chance! is a word which always leaves a very wide margin. I knocked at the door; there was no reply. All was breathlessly still. Again I knocked, and still there was no sound from within. After some hesitation I tried the door-it was not locked--I opened it, and crossed the threshold. The captain's room was lighted by a candle, which stood in-the centre of a large table covered with green cloth. It would require a great many words to give anything like a correct idea of the place. It was elegantly carpeted, pleasantly warmed, and one side of it was occupied by a huge sideboard, covered with glass- es, decanters, and cold viands. The space above the mantel was decorated with fencing-foils, boxing-gloves, and the satin slipper of an opera dancer. As for the walls, they displayed four or five pictures, in heavy gilt frames-pictures suggestive of the social state of ancient Greece and Rome in their worst days. The'table itself spoke volumes; there was a file of sporting papers; a pack of cards, braninew; a case of duelling pis- tols, and a glass of brandy and water. And at the table, in a cushioned arm- chair, sat Captain Burley Hayne, his head dropped on his ruffled shirt his hand laid listlessly on the table itself, evidently fast asleep. His dark hair was tangled and disordered, and threw a shadow over his face. He had been overcome by exhaustion, in the midst of his virtuous labors, and was in a profound sleep. I coughed; made a noise with my feet; but the captain did not stir. Determined to converse with him, I called his name loud and louder,-"Cap- tain Hayne! Captain Hayne!" but still he did not show the slightest sign of awaking from his slumber. "I thought you called," said a voice, and the demure Pittson stood at my shoulder. I turned to him angrily--"Wait with- out, as 1 directed " But Pittson, in-   stead of leaving the room, advanced to the table, took the light, and raised it to the captain's face. It was something of a contrast: the thin frame and sharp visage of the policeman, and the broad, burly form and bushy head of the cap- tain. After a keen survey of a moment, Pittson put down the candle, and turned to me, with an oath--a rare thing for him--indeed, I had never before heard a profane word from his lips. "By --! that man will be hard to wake! Dead as a grindstone!" '; Dead! You are jesting!"I cried, and passed round the table. I shook the captain roughly by the shoulder; he did not move. I pushed aside his bushy lair and raised his head; the light, for the first time, shone fully in his face. A horrible. face! Mouth agape; com- plexion yellow and livid; eyes fixed in a glassy stare; a horrible face, with death printed in every lineament. "Suicide!"I cried, shrinking back horror-stricken, as I saw the stain of blood on his vest, over the left breast. "A pistol shot, anyhow!" exclaimed Pittson, bending over the table, and shading his eyes, as he examined the marks left by the pistol bullet in its passage. "Not by suicide-no! no! But by my hand!" said a strange voice, clear and ringing in its every accent. CHAPTER XXVI. AND from the door of the next apart- ment- suddenly opened - came the speaker, a young woman, whose hair fell disordered and in tangled masses about her face. Her bonnet was' crushed upon her head, as if by a heavy blow; her attire, gay and tawdry, was'damp with rain, and soiled with the mud of the streets. And framed in the crushed bonnet and matted hair, appeared a face not long ago rosy and blooming with all the life of seventeen, but now as colorless as the visage of a corpse; the only life in it was the wild feverish glare of the expanded eyes. Clenching her head, with her taw- dry shawl, dangling from one arm to the floor, she came forward with a rapid step.    , "I did it. Am proud of the deedl   To-night-not an hour ago, I met him at the corner of the next street. I asked him for a dollawfor I was houseless. He refused me and passed on. I ran side by side with him, and clung to his arm, telling him how he had brought me from my home and after all his QFhs and promises had left me to walk to streets of New-York,-to-to-to-" her utter- ance grew thick and hysterical. "And he thrust me aside, and when I clung to him again, he struck me-yes, he struck me! And then passed on, not caring whether I lay dead upon the side-walk But I was not dead; I followed him:  found him here in his room, examinmng his pistols by the light of the candle. As I entered, I seized one of the pistrls; it was loaded, thank God! I fired-and, killed him,-illed him, do you hear?" She stopped, and the echoes of her hysterical bursts of laughter sounded strange and horrible in that room, where death sat in hideous reality. "Oh! you base, bad man, she cried, approaching the chair, and looking at the corpse, as thoughit were still the living Captain Burley Hayne. "Oh! you base, bad man, had you no shame? Not one throb of feeling? Were you indeed hu- man? How could you treat me thus? You know what you told me when you took me from my home; how you had a better home for me here, in New- York; and what a dear good wife I would be to you; and now you sit there dead-and H0 my God! look at me! What am I " The violence of her emotions, the mad- ness which for an hour had filled her veins, now flung her into a deathke swoon; she fell on her knees, her face resting on her clenched hands, and' her hair falling in thick masses over the ta- ble. Mr. Pittson, who was a grim, demure man, much accustomed to the sight of every form of human misery, turned his face from the sight, muttering, as he rubbed the corner of each eye, "Bad pa- pers for you, cap'in! bad papers!" ,A dead stillness prevailed for a few mo- ments, while the girl, in her swoon, knelt beside the table and the captain sat hid- eously erect in his chair. That silence was broken by the voices of two gentlemen, who entered the room from the stairway.   "What! Mr. Van Warner, here at this hour!" was the remark of the bland Mr. Morgan, who was evidently deeply sur- prised when he beheld me. "Come to offer an apology, I suppose? said his companion. the venerable and wicked Eliphalet Cloud. "Won't do, young man, he'll wing you,-a dead shot, a dead shot!  He'll -" the words hung on his lips, for his gaze encoun- tered the face of the dead man. The idiotic stare which expanded his eves as I hurriedly related how, and by whose hands the captain met his death, could only be exceeded in repulsiveness by the fixed glare of the dead man's eyes. Even the composed M organ grew pale, and sunk back into a chair, cover- ing his face for a moment with his hands. Suddenly, the horror printed on Elipha- let's visage was succeeded by an expre- sion impossible to describe; an expres- sion which reminded you of nothing save a grin on the visage of a corpse. c' Dead is he!"I heard him mutter to himself-"D-n him! I rather guess1 captain, you won't use that little bit o paper now." It was just after daybreak when I as- cended the stairs which ledto Eugenia's home. Feverish, from loss of rest, to say nothing of long-continued excite- ment, I wished to see her at the earliest moment, and tell her that it was no longer needful for me to kill, or be killed in'a duel. I passed into the anteroom, and knocked gently at the door. There was no sound in reply, but the door was slightly ajar; I pushed it open and en- tered. A dim light-the ray of a can- dle fluttering in its socket-was shed around the humble features of that room. Eugenia was there, on her knees, all unconscious of my presence; her hands clasped, her eyes upraised, her black hair floating over her neck and bosom. There are two expressions, the most inexpressibly beautiful, which by turns pass over the face of a pure and lovely woman. One is when religion fills her being, and sends its calm, holy light to the upraised eyes, shedding over every feature the baptism of a deathless emo- tion; the other, when pure love (in itself a part-yes, the essence of religion,) first courses in heaven-born sunshine over her  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7091-00000038"/> face, filling the eyes, blooming like young June on the lip and cheek, while the first time the words "my husband!" tremble oa the air. Of these expressions, so beautiful be- yond the power of words, that of religion now baptized the face of Eugenia. She was praying; my name was in her prayer and on her lips as I came into the room. As she saw me she bounded to her feet, made a step forward, as though about to spring into my arms, but. paus- ing where she stood, blushing and beau- tiful, gasped the words-"It is over then! You are safe! There-there is no stain of blood upon your hands?" "It is over, Eugenia!"I replied. "There is no stain of blood upon my hands. In'a word, there has been no duel. Captain Burley Hayne has been summoned to his last account." "Dead!". she gasped, opening wide her eyes, and growing very pale, as she sunk into a chair. I took my seat beside her. and while she sat, pale and frightened, related the details of the captain's fate. "So sudden!" she interrupted me; "and by avictim's hand. Gone in his sins to his last account! Oh! it is hor- rible!" A pause ensued, and we sat silently gazing in each other's faces, by the light of the flickering candle. At length, while the early sunshine began to mingle with the flickering light, I began to talk of our future--of our mar- riage, of the quiet home, far from the ( atmosphere of the city's crimes, where  we would live when our fates were joined i in one. "To-morrow is Saturday. Your bro-  ther's pardon will arrive. I will place t him in good hands, afar from the temp- I tations and vices of New-York-and  then, SEugenia. your brother, safe from all  harm, we will be married." I paused. I for her gaze no longer met mine; her I downcast eyes and half-averted face indi- cated an emotion which t could not de- c fine. "O Frank!" she said, calling me for d the first time by name, "something tells v me that our marriage had better not be. a Thinkr nenot ungrateful! think not that t I do not-love you! But our social con-  dition is unequal. The world .in which t you move will say that I had married b   g you for your wealth. And-and-" she t noturned toward me Her radiant eyes,- e "Oh! let me be to you as sister to dear- est brother!"Her words were hesi- - tating, but the look which shone in every lineament of her face contradicted her words. - "Eugenia!"I said, taking her hand, 'you love me! That is enough! On; Monday next you will be mine-my wife!" I  Yes-yes-" she faltered " but there i at my heart a presentiment of evil. for which I cannot account-" CHAPTER XXVII. SHE paused, and laid her hand upon her bosom, and in that moment-was it a dream, an omen?-a shadow flung by the dark wing of an overshadowing fate  In that moment, between me and Euge- nia, there came, or seemed to come, the image of my hag-wife, hideous and scowl- ing, followed by Eva, beautiful as ever, but with sadness and reproach in her eyes. It was for a moment only. It was as palpable and vivid as an object brought out from intense darkness, for an instant, by a flash of lightning. Eugenia broke the silence, as she rose from her chair, and placed a small book, a thin volume, bound inca brown cover, in my hands.  "Read this," she said, "and then say whether it is well that one of my social condition should link her life with a man of your wealth. It is a little book, but it says a great deal," Wondering, I took the book; opened it, and glanced over its pages. It was a lit- tle book, composed of a few pages of for- mal manuscript, and yet it did say a great deal. There was a world of meaning in its cramped, formal pages. It was the book in which were kept the accounts of Eugenia and her employer. For a week's labor of sixteen hours a day, employed upon the finest kind of needlework, Eugenia received just two dollars and a half-sb said the book. A week's labor, that taxed eye and hand, and lungs, to their utmost, repaid with twenty shillings, to speak in the dialect of New-York! And for every dollar that the embroideress received, her employer, by the sale of the production of her   needle, received his ten dollars! I could not help throwing the account book on the table, with a gesture of indignation and contempt. "Behold the justice of society to its weakest and most helpless members!" I ejaculated. "For the same amount of labor, expended in any branch of mechan- ics or manufactures, a man would receite at least one dollar per day! But woman is weak, she is defenceless. she can be robbed with impunity!-" "Or-"Eugenia interrupted me. her eyes downcast, and her neck and face all crimson, for the moment-"Or, if she does not choose to lead this kind of life, there is yet open to her another career. That of the poor girl by whose hands Burley Hayne met his fate! But you are surprised at the record of my labors. Here is a book which will. urprise you more. It is a book lent to me by a poor seamstress, who works for the proprietor of a clothing store-" and she placed the second book in my hands. 'Talk of black slavery! In what re- spect can it rival with the white slavery, a portion only of whose unutterable hor- rors was detailed in the cramped figures of the book which I held-a slavery which, in order to make clothing cheap, works up the heart and lungs and life of poor womanhood into 'garments for the nobler sex at-just sixteen pennies per day!--a slavery which-does not fall upon an inferior race, abounding in rude phy- sical life-in rude happy animal life; nor upon strong men, able to buffet and to bear misfortune, but upon women, refined, delicate women, rendered sensitive by education and religion-women, fit to be mothers, wives, sisters, daughters of the best of you, O noble, disinterested mas- culine sex! Unroof New-York, and in her darkest haunts you will find a thousand women fit by nature to fulfil the highest 'duties of wonman's life, but who, by the wages- system of this great Christian city, have been consigned to that death of the soul which is a thousand fold more horrible than the death which lays the body in the coffin and the grave. Well, Eugenia P! I said, flinging the accursed book to the floor-"' it is in my heart to kneel at your feet, and in you worship the enshrined images of holy poverty and spotless virtue-! You not   worthy of my hand. O would to heaven I was worthy of yours!" Here let "Ti;E MAN OF THE WORLDn pause in his narrative for a little while, while the editor of these papers intrudes upon the reader a few thoughtp suggest- ed by the facts just 'stated-facts which tell of the awful contrasts presented by the WEALTH and POVERTY of a great city like New-York. It is a pitiful thing that, side by side with the most splendid victories won by our modern civilization over- dumb mat- ter, POVERTY marches steadily on, like a skeletonhat the shoulder of the voluptu- ous queen of some banquet-hall. Look around you! and you behold everywhere the trophies of enterprise- edifices whose majestic architecture rivals the wonders of old Rome-telegraphs that annihilate space-Ericsson inven- tionrs, that revolutionize the industrial interests of an entire age. And look be- fore you! and there are little children, in rags and naked feet, sweeping the cross- ings of the streets. On one hand, the St.. Nicholas Hotel and Grace Church; on the other, the Five Points. Why these contrasts? Can it be true, as gravely asserted by sleek gentlemen, with well developed physical organiza- tions, and good accounts at bank, that no one is poor but those who deserve to be so? That success is the test of virtue; the want of it, the badge of crime? Talk like this may do for a couple of portly gentlemen, gravely engaged at beefsteak and old Port; or for some edi- torling, whose inquiries into life and its mysteries have never led him to a higher aspiration than- a seat at the opera. But for those who see misery everywhere;. see it livid, half-naked, and more horrible to look upon, because it is everywhere contrasted with enormous wealth and boundless luxury- those who. thus see ing it and confronted by it at every turn, are either hardened into callousness or wrung with perpetual anguish by the sight-the doctrine of portly gentlemen and editorling w-ill by no means suffice. Once admit that wealth is the iufail- ing sign of virtue; poverty, the brand crf crime, and you write " felon" on the fore- heads of the noblest men. whose glorious names brighten along the pathway of ages.  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7091-00000039"/> Nay; you put the brand of infa- my upon a life whose every detail was but an exemplification, in the most unut- terably touching form, of the divine gos- pel of self-denial; a life which made pov- erty holy,' and failure godlike; a life which begun with the calm hymn of, "Good tidings to the poor!" yet ended with that burst of unutterable anguish, "Eli! Eli! lama sabachthani!" That life was designed as a lesson, as an example, as a consolation, to all the sons of men, in and through all time; it was that holy, beautiful life-intended as an embodiment of humanity, in its deep- est sorrows and loftiest yearnings walk- ing patiently the fire-paved track of pov- erty and suffering; and when you say to the poor man, "Your poverty is the re- sult of crime;" to the unsuccessful, "Your failure is the effect of your own sins," your brutal taunt falls not only upon the poor and unsuccessful, but upon His forehead who is the master of us all. You mock God, and in his place enthrone Mammon, that lowest of all the devils, who, while his prouder compeers stood erect, blasted but defiant, went crawling on all fours in search of pennies. "Any one Who does right can get along. It's only- the idle, the improvi- dent, or the criminal, who are poor."  This, reader, is not the sentiment of a  professed atheist, but of a large number ' of good folks, who dress well, eat well, sleep. well, and rather think themselves the exact models of respectability and  virtue. Let us try their doctrine a ' moment.  If, though the rain and sleet of this ] drear winter night, you will look into \ yonder-hovel? no, but huge mansion, 3 rising in the heart of the great city, and  tenanted by at least a hundred of the most miserable of the poor-if you will I cast your gaze into a particular room, lighted by a single candle, you will be- hold a pale woman working with her  needle.               1 A woman in suffering; but a girl, o scarcely more than a child in years; a eyes glaring feverishy in their hollow t sockets, cheeks sunken, lips pinched and t white, and the dead, blank look of misery c and want on every lineament.    S This girl-woman, by the death of her s father, a hard-working laborer, who all his life toiled late and early for rent- t   - money and bread; and; when he could s work no more, died, has become the only - protector and hope of the brother and - sister, little children, whom you may see - sleeping now upbn the bed in yonder corner of the miserable room. To keep f, them in bread and home, the girl-woman I works at her needle sixteen hours a day -works until pulse is feverish, eyes hot and dim, and lungs heavy as lead-for which she gets per day from sixteen to twenty-five pennies; from wnom, we will not say, for we wish to spare the feelings of the sleek gentlemen who work up the lungs and lives of women into merchandize. Well, sixteen pennies per day is rather small capital upon which the girl-woman is to support herself, and feed and clothe her orphan brother and sister. Even the sixteen pennies will tnot last long, for the consumption is busy at the life of the girl-woman; in a little while there will be a grave dug for her. Now; gentle and comfortable people, who smack your lips as you say.-"Any one that is not idle and improvident can get along; the idle, the improvident, the criminal only, are poor"-will you tell us the particular sin of this girl-woman, who is now digging her grave with her needle? You can hear her grave-cough, as, for -an instant, she stops in her work and looks up with her feverish eyes. The particular sin of this girl, if you please? Life has never disclosed to her any of its blossoms-nothing but its thorns. The joys of love, the name of wife, the holy wealth of motherhood can nevbr be hers. She is dedicating herself to death, for the support of her brother and sister. Now, of what sin is she guilty? Speak out, sleek gentlemen! Was it a sin in her that her father unable to work any longer, fell sick and died? When she is dead, the boy and girl, her brother and sister, will be cast friend- less upon the world, without, education or hope, the boy to end, it may be, one winter's day, in the open square within the Tombs, the rope about his neck and the gibbit over his head; the girl to come at last to a death-bed by which will sit no comforters but dishonor and shame. Now, will you; complacent gentlemen, tell us what sin it is of this orphan boy   and girl, that, by father and sister's death, they are cast adrift upon the world? Their poverty is the effect of their sin, you know-that is your doc- trine-tell us the particulaisin? But, say you, this case is exceptional, and button your pockets over your well filled purses. Exceptional! O most convenient loop-hole! through which you can creep to escape the consequences of your infernal dogma. This case is not exceptional. It is the case, in some shape or other, of one-half at least of the large city's poor-poor, who are poor through no fault of theirs, but who work straight on for bread as long as life's daylight holds out. At the worst, scarcely one-fourth of the poor are poor from their own fault. Bring out your statistics; lift the veil which hides the secrets of society; and you will find this to be a truth, hard even for you to get over. But, taking the other side of your dogma, by which you all, complacent gentlemen, tell us, in effect, if not in so many words-that wealth is the sign of a virtuous life, spent in honest efort- you will allow us to pause a moment, while we endeavor to believe that you are not in earnest-that this dogma is, only a joke of yours, a very brutal joke, yet still intended for a joke. Wealth always, or in one case out of three, the symbol of a virtuous life spent in honest effort! Horrible mockery! Where is the man who dares trace to their real source five out of ten of the great fortunes of this metropolis? The man does not live who dares do it. And if such a man did live, his disclosures, or rather his analysis, would cause him to be 'hunted forth like a wild beast from the pale of city civilization. CHAPTER XXVIII. ON Saturday morning I went into the Tombs,-that stone nightmare which squats upon the breast of New-York, surrounded by the atmosphere of moral pestilence. Ascending the steps, and passing through those gloomy pillars, whose very shadows seem to be imbued with memories of violence and bloodshed, I   soon found myself in the court-room, where the obscurity of a cloudy day was relieved by gas-light. -Under the domed ceiling, were law- yers, witnesses, judges, jurymen and criminals-a vivid and heterogeneous picture. From yonder door, cririnatls emerge from their cells to receive the sentence due their crimes; and through yonder door, once sentenced, they pass again, to linger a little while in the Tombs, ere they are consigned to the living death of the State Prison. That court of sessions' room' is a thea- tre; every one who appears there, whether as lawyer, witness, juryman, judge, or criminal, is an actor; the only essential difference between it and the Park or Bowery, is, that when the actors have played their parts under this dom- ed ceiling, some of them retire through yonder door to be consigned to the moral death of the State Prison, or to the more merciful death inflicted by the gallows. The judge, supported by two aldermen, was on the bench;.and, before him, in the centre of the scene, a criminal stood up to receive his sentence. The judge was a pleasant, mild-faced man, who had become so accustomed to sentencing criminals, that he did it very much in the same manner that a tired clerk at Stew- art's disposes of a dress pattern to a very  troublesome and homely woman. And, contrasted with the round, pleas- ant face of the judge, was the sharp, ner- vous visage of the criminal-a swarthy boy of eighteen, whose matted hair fell over his forehead, while his small glitter- ing eyes wandered in defiance over the crowded cdurt. It was John Smith, otherwise known as Edward Cloud, the brother of Euge- nia. The judge expected his pardon from the governor in the afternoon, but pro- ceeded to sentence the, prisoner as though there was no thought of pardon in the case. As for myself, I had thought it best not to communicate one word con- cerning the anticipated pardon to the un- fortunate boy. Eugenia had not seen him since the day when, from a para- graph in a daily paper, she had been led to believe that the young burglar and her missing brother was the same per- son,-when she had gone to the Tombs, crossed the dreary prison yard, ascended  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7091-00000040"/> \ to cell "No. --," and took the wretch- ed outcast to her arms. And but a few hours before, I hd left Engenia in her modest home, and came alone to the Tombs, to hear the law's last judgment upon her brother. Well! there was a buzzing noise all over the room, as the young culprit stood up to hear his sentence; then the sharp voice and sharper knuckles of an officer commanding "Silence!" and then you might have heard a pin drop. As the judge began to read the sen- tence from a written paper. the young burglar glanced about the court with an earnest and softened gaze, glanced over every face and peered into every corner, and for a moment his face quivered and his lips trembled. He was looking for Eugenia! And when the consciousness came upon him that her face was not there,-that there was not one face there to look upon him with pity and with  love,-the softened look passed from his  countenance; he was sullen, defiant, al- most brutal again. He drew his rough overcoat closer over his chest, clenched his right hand, and faced the judge with an unfaltering gaze.  The remarks with which the judge i prefaced the sentence were of the usual I character,-well meant, without doubt,  but calculated to make the sides of a v devil ache with laughter, that is, if devils c ever laugh when the humbug of this t world is paraded before their eyes. f "Great wrong committed on society, -shocking depravity in one so young,- ( have time to reflect upon your crime, t and atone for it within the walls of the n State Prison;" such were some of the c prominent heads of the judge's brief ser- I mon.                h He did not say a word about any duty which society owed to the miserable out- y cast; did not breathe a whisper in regard A to the depraved father who had left his c boy to try the hard battle of the world, a friendless and alone; not the shadow of a whisper concerning those bitter years d of ragged, half-naked, hungry, tempted ir childhood, which the boy had endured sl in the great city. O no! such things never h come within the knowledge of the law. y( It is simply the business of the law to imprison and to kill.        vi The judge coiLluded his homily with E this brilliant and startling thought- o]   - John Smith, it is the sentence of the court that you be imprisoned for the term of three years at Sing-Sing." To which John replied, with a look which showed that State Prison discipline would do about as muc% to reform his soul as a course of sawdust and brickbats would to fatten his body. -He was then taken out; the door closed after him; the court buzzed again; again an officer cried and rapped, "Or- der!" and the judge proceeded to- the dispatch of other business. That afternoon the pardon came, sign- ed by the noble-hearted governor, and Eugenia and myself went to the Tombs, and brought the young convict from his gloomy cell into free daylight. No one who had seen his hard, callous face in the morning, would have imagined him to be the same boy. We took him to Eugenia's home, where he sat on the edge of a chair, his nether lip quivering, and his eye roving about the room, as if he was not altogether certain that he was awake. "I thought you'd forget me-I did ; -he faltered, as. he looked into the face of Eugenia--'"I did. Are you, really my sister? No you aint-you aint3 You the sister of a cuss like me?"He turned his face away from the light, to- ward the wall, and leaning over the back of the chair, ("wept bitterly"-perhaps the first tears he shed since he wandered from his New-England birthplace. At this moment, Col. Eliphalet Cloud (whose consent, by the by, I had ob- tained the day .before to the anticipated marriage) came into the room, prim and cadaverous, and " dressed to the death." He gazed at the sobbing convict through his eye-glass. "This is you, is it? What a bad boy  you've been! A very-very bad boyl You must have kept shockingly low company!  You  young villain, ',r ashamed'of you!" To which the boy, raising his face, down which the tears were freely cours- ing, made reply, as he gazed at the fossi' specimen .of the man of the world before him-"Get out  Who the    are you! What are you gassin' at me fur?o It was an odd picture-the ragged con- vict son, and the genteel scoundrel father. Eugenia came between them, and led the old gentleman into the back room.   On the next Monday we were married. There were no guests at our wedding- only Eugenia, myself, and, the clergy- man, (the same who had officiated. at the marriage. of Louis and Evelina,) were present. In the same parlor where I had first met Eugenia, she. placed her hand in mine, and called me " husband!" As for the good old man, her father, (whose virtues were only surpassed by those of my own departed parent,) I had placed him in an establishment of his own, where he could drink and gamble to his heart's content. The boy, in whom traces of a better nature were ap- parent, I had sent far into the country, to the house of a good clergyman, where he-might retrieve-the errors of his youth, in preparation for a bright and useful manhood. Happy days now in the grave city mansion! No thought of hag-wife now --only a softened and touching memory, of Eva! The place was musical now with the voice of Eugenia,.and the long- deserted rooms imbued with the glory ofther presence and her beauty. Happy days!' Few women have walked this earth combining the same qualities as Eugenia-now, the tenderest child in her emotions ; and now, the proud, queenly, intellectual woman. And yet, Why was it that oftentimes, in the very moment when her face was all radiant with life and loveliness, a cloud would, come upon it, for an instant only, but the sadder to behold from its contrast with her previous joyousness? Do you see yonder old mansion that stands upon the heights above the Hud- son,-bearing traces of the cannon-shot of the Revolution on its walls of dark gray stone-a massive edifice, centred in a garden, its steep roof overhung by the boughs of encircling oaks? Between the garden and the Hudson there is a steep cliff-a broken link of the Pali- sades - and, standing in the garden walk, by that huge old oak; which has faced the winter of three centuries, the broad Hudson, the roof and steeples of New-York, the Sound, the Heights of Brooklyn, and the glorious Manhattan Bay, all lie stretched before you. distinct as the lines of a map, and as beautiful as any picture every lighted up by a sum- mer morning sun. The mansion itself is very massive and lu rbiaru Ia l19jtIy1.3tt VI51   gloomy, with wings projecting to the north and south; and within its sombre walls are many rooms, all bearing the same appearance of stately grandeur which they wore in the Revolution- rooms which, it is said, long ago were the theatres of crimes which never found a record in the books of courts of law. There is a hearthstone there yet red with the stain of a tragedy enacted seventy years ago. Well, this house I purchased, and, as May came, led Eugenia across its thresh- hold. It was a bright, beautiful day; May rippled over the river's surface, and scattered her blossoms among the trees. I was the happiest man alive, and as for Eugenia, never had she looked so sur- passingly beautiful. We crossed the threshold. No omen scared us back. And yet the most terrible event of both our lives was to happen within those walls. I can see Eugenia yet, as she lingered for a moment on the threshold, her face and form framed in the 'dark doorway; the form robed in white, with a shawl of many colors falling aside from her no- ble bust; the face set in the shadow of her rich black hair. Her bonnet had fallen to her shoulders, her hand was lifted to her brow, as she looked forth upon the spring sunshipo, the river, the city and the bay. Very beautiful! Who, in this queenly woman, now pausing on the threshold of the house which, (with its lands,) I had purchased for her in her own name, would have recognized the poor seamstress of New-York?? "Oh, is not the day beautiful, Frank?" -* she cried, in the very fullness of her joy. "Beautiful, Eugenia!"And, all un- conscious of the dark future, we went over the threshold into the gloomy house. CHAPTER XXIX. WFF lived in the old mansion, afar from the world, and untroubled by the laborious amusements of what is called fashionable life, and I was happy once more, and I lived again; the black me- imories of the past grew dim and dim- mer. May expanded into summer, au- tumn passed, winter shone calm and cold from clear skies through the boughs of leafless trees. "Spring was near  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7091-00000041"/> again, and Eugenia was crowned with the holy name of mother!"A new face bloomed in blessing on our home. 0 the calm, untroubled peace of those days! One evening in early June, as I was returning alone from New-York to my country mansion, the carriage broke down on the high road, not more than a mile from home. I left it in charge of the coachman, and walked homeward. It was one of those mild, beautiful even- ings, enriched by the light of the rising moon, and fragrant with the breath of young summer, which you never forget. As I entered the gate, and took the winding path which led through the grounds to the old house, there was a paly stillness in the air. Grand and majestic rose the old trees around me, their leaves moving with the faintest motion; now and then a turn of the path gave me a glimpse of the Hudson, rippling in the moonlight, and of the distant city, which slept, or seem- ed to sleep, in the smile of the calm, hallowed night. Walking quietly on, every sense lulled by the sacred influence of the hour, I was thinking of my past and of my pres- ent life, and thanking God most fervently that the darkness of the past was dim in my memory, while the joy of my present was upon me, vivid and all-ab- sorbing, like a gush of sunshine through an open window in the better world. Thus I drew near my home, and came into the garden, which encircled the 5gray old walls with a drapery of foliage, vines and blossoms. There was a window, which served the purposes of window and door, and opened on the garden from the sitting- room of Eugenia. It was framed in a flowering vine. Instead of approaching the hall-door, I drew near this window, determining to enter by it and surprise Eugenia. The sash was raised; the light from the room came cheerfully forth, mingling with the rays of the moon. Concealing myself among the vines, I looked within. In a fine old room, with paneled walls and arched fireplace, sat Eugenia, reading by a candle which stood on a workstand near her, while her babe was sleeping in a cradle at her feet. She was attired in a flowing white robe, and her   dark hair was disposed in glossy masses about her face. Serene and pure, she sat there in her quiet room, a soft glow on her cheek, her eyes half veiled by the downcast lashes-the very impersona- tion of all that is noble in woman, wif and mother. While I stood silently contemplating this picture, a door opened, and, to my unfeigned surprise, a man whose face I had never seen before entered the room.         .  A man of some twenty-seven years, with a pale, haggard face, dark hair that hung in tangled and uneven locks, and large glittering eyes. His dress was faded and worn, and he louked very much like a man who had -seen much misfortune, poverty, and, perchance, crime. He approached Eugenia silently, and stood near her, unperceived, gazing upon her with a look in which hatred seemed to struggle with other emotions. Was his object robbery? I stood spell-bound, yet prepared to rush upon him the moment he showed signs of violence. Fortunately, I was armed; by some chance or other, I car- ried a revolving pistol in the breast of my dress-coat. I drew it silently forth, and covered the intruder with a deliber- ate aim. It may be imagined that I  awaited the issue of this scene in keen suspense. Still, Eugenia, reading, had not raised her eyes or perceived the presence of the stranger. He drew  a step nearer, stealthily, noiselessly, and' reached forth his hand. Then, in a low voice, broken by a strong effort to restrain some deep emotion, he spoke. I heard every word. "Well, Eugenia! It is about three years since last we met, or rather since we parted. She raised her eyes, and for the first time beheld him. All color fled from her face. She sat on the sofa as though suddenly paralyzed. Then rising to her feet, pale and tremb- ling, her lips bleached, and the hands which she extended quivering as with a spasm. she faltered forth the words,-"Albert  Albert! O my God, is it you!"And the next moment she was in his arms, sobbing on his breast; and he, the dark expression gone from his face pressed his kiss upon her forehead with impas- sioned rapture. I staggered back from J   the window as. thougl my reason had been bewildered by a vtlent blow. I wandered, I know not why, down the garden toward the cliff which over- hune the river shore. The moon was shining brightly; the river stretched along there, calm and beautiful in the soft light; nature all around me was still, but the agonies of the damned were tearing at my heart-strings, On the edge of the cliff, I leaned against a tree, and pressed my hands to my forehead in the effort to collect my shattered senses. As I looked back upon the events of that fearful night, I can remember distinctly that, after stand- ing for a moment on the verge of the cliff I went up the garden-walk, toward the house, the pistol in my hand; that I trembled from head to foot; that the ground seemed to rock beneath my tread, but that my eye was clear, my hand firm; that, as I reached the porch in front of my mansion; a man came forth, passing from the shadow into the light of the moon until he stood face to face with me. I can remember bow there was a glow as of triumph on his pale face, and how he met my gaze with a look all defiance and insolence. I can remember that I called him by his first name-the name which had trembled from the lips of my wife-that I told him to look his last upon the river and sky; for, as there -was a God above us, he must die. I can remember the look he gave as he staggered back from the leveled pistol; how he cried, "Hold! I have never harmed you!"-and how I drove him before me, step by step, until he was against one of the pillars of the porch, and there I made an end of the scene, and fired. He fell forward on his face, bathed in blood. I can remember a shriek, and- a hurried step, and the form of a woman bending over the dying man, until her white dress was spotted with his blood. After this. all memory is a dead blank, only broken by dreams that might change heaven itself into hell.- CHAPTER XXX. FROM the moment when in clear moon- light I saw a woman's form bending over the dying man, until her white robes were stained with blood, a vague shadow   i'heuhs6 over my life--a vague and aw- ful shadow, broken only now and then by gleams of light that resemble a flash of lightning, the crater of an extinct vol- cano. What a strange, horrible existence be- came mine! My individuality was lost. I was a king, an emperor, a savage beast, a tree blasted in the midst of a blooming garden; I was my hag-wife, and Eva, any thing, every thing, but myself. I knew not where I was, whether in this world or the next, whether in a palace or a prison; I only lived in my dreams, and the last dream that possess- ed me, more vivid than any reality I had ever encountered, clothed and surround- ed me with its own peculiar associations. As long as that dream lasted I lived in it, and in it only; when it passed, an- other took its place. Such dreams never before harrowed an immortal soul! I was buried alive; they had nailed down the coffin-lid they had locked the door of the vault and left me there; I was living in my coffin, and it was my judgment that I could not die. Gnashing my teeth and tearing my flesh in my efforts to burst the coffin-lid, I still had no power to kill myself. Then, I had committed the unpardon- able sin, and was exiled to some distant corner of the universe, where neither man, nor angel, nor devil-not even one ray of God's presence-could visit me, for I was an outlaw from heaven, earth, and hell. I was the only occupant of a blasted planet, whose volcanic mountains arose into a coppe;-colored sky. There was no sun, nor moon, nor tree, nor flower, nothing but mountains of a leaden color, lighted by smouldering volcanoes and towering away, away, and away, until their peaks were lost in a copper-colored sky. Then I was a spirit returned to earth again, and forced to occupy the body of some inferior animal; beaten, starved, overworked, always endeavoring to speak and tell the human faces round me that I was not a beast, but an immortal soul, and always finding my utterance dying away in a brutal howl.  ,This passed, and another dream came. From the beast I glided into tie empe- ror. I was Napoleon amid the snows and cannon-smoke of AusterlhtU or by the glare of the burning Kremlin, or on *  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7091-00000042"/> the rock of St. Helena. The blood I shed could not be measured; the corpses I laid around me, wherever I went, made all the earth white with the livid faces. I was happy in carnage, and pursued murder as a lover his mistress. From Napoleon on his throne I was suddenly transformed into my hag-wife, suspended by the cord, always struggling, choking, strangling, and never dying. Then I was Eva in her coffin, with her dead baby on her breast, and saw my own self bending over the coffin and weeping there. Thus, dream succeeded dream, not like the visions of a fever, but most strangely and horribly palpable; and I. had no existence of my own. Whether moments, hours or days passed, I had not the remotest consciousness. At last I seemed to awake, and looked about me with the external eye. I found myself in a small room, with the sunlight shining'through the grated barl of a solitary window. I was seated on a small cot. Near my feet were cords, which had, to all appearance, but lately bound my wrists and ankles. I was clad in a jacket and trowsers of coarse cotton. "Madhouse or jail?"I muttered, and  seemed to hear my own voice for the first time since the night of the murder.  I arose and went to the window. A summer sun, near its setting, shone over  a garden, a prospect of woods, and fields,  and a distant city, from a calm, clear  sky. O how that calm, happy view, so O full of the spirit of peace, contrasted with t my late dreams!  Turning fromr the window, I looked ( around my cell. The grated door had, 1 by some chance, been left open. I passed v through the doorway, and found myself a in a long, dimly-lighted and silent cor- v ridor.               a Without a' definite object I wandered 1 along this corridor until I came to a point a where it connected with another. Here, s from an opened door, a gleam of light shone out on the dark passage.   p I pushed the door wide open, entered, g and found myself in a well-furnished t apartment, with an elegant bed, chairs, table overspread with books and papers; n evidently the apartment of some offi- cial connected with the place. A ma- b hogany wardrobe-stood between the bed d and the window. !   This I opened, and as quietly as t though the event was a matter of course, proceeded to exchange my coarse cot- ton garments for asuit of black cloth, which happened to fit me, and which I found in the wardrobe. A pair of boots stood near the table, a hat and white cravat stood upon it; these, in a moment, I assumed. I could not tell how the dress became me, for there was no mir- ror in the room, but after carefully sur- veying myself, I sallied forth, resolved to entrust my adventures to fate or chance. I -plunged into the second corridor, dimly lighted like the other, and walked- on (the doors of cells on either hand) until I came to a large grated door, which stretched across the passage. Beyond this an official waited. silent and demure as a statue. lIe unbolted the door without a word, and sufflred me to pass, evidently taking me for the person whose dress I had as- sumed. "This is better than my dreams, any- how!"I muttered, and hurried on. I soon came to a second door, beyond whose bars I saw a passage all light and sunshine. The second official, like the first, suf fered me to pass without a word. The passage into which I now entered resembled the ward of a hospital-the ward for convalescents-only that it was lighter and more cheerful. Numerous windows on eith!r hand gave entrance to the rays of the declining sun, and opened to the gaze a pleasant prospect of fields and gardens, and a distant vil- lage or city. Up and down this passage walked, perchance, fifty men, of all ages, and mostly well-dressed-up and down. with a quick, nervous motion, and with a perpetual fire in their restless eyes. These did not resemble convicts so much as the better class of patients of an-in- sane hospital. Raising my kerchief to my face. I passed rapidly through their various groups, and soon came to the door at. the other extremity of the passage. The third official, like the others, let me pass without a word. I traversed a wide hall, descended a broad stairway; and, through a lofty door. emerged into open sunshine. Still keeping the handkerchief to my   face, I hurried down a broad garden walk, toward the porter's lodge, which I saw in the distance. Half-way down, I encountered a party, composed of la- dies and gentlemen, who had evidently been visiting the place, for they were chatting pleasantly about the various forms of insanity which they had be- held. As I came up, I heard my own name. O how like a word from another lan- guage it sounded! "Yes, he is there," said another voice, "but the public are never admitted to the ward in which he is confined. They only keep the most hopeless and des- perate there!" Passing the kerchief rapidly over my face, I passed through the group, and heard the whisper as I passed-"That is Doctor N-, one of the most suc- cessful in the treatment of "hopeless cases." I approached the porter's lodge, and now, for the first time, my heart began to beat with anxiety. Would the porter detect the'cheat? The sight of sun, of' trees, of flowers, the fiee atmosphere which filled my. lungs, all conspired to fill me with new energy. and I hurried on with a rapid step. The porter, a middle-aged man, rose from his chair, approached the gate, looked at me languidly, and-let me pass! I was free! I did not cast a single backward- look upon the massive pile which had lately imprisoned me, but, turning, my face to the village or city, hurried on. A-train of cars stood waiting by a de- pot. Passing rapidly through the crowd upon the platform, I entered the first car hat offered, and flung myself on a seat na dark corner, In a moment the train was whirling away, and I saw the roofs of the Asyk lum shine in the sun. far behind me. just before they were hidden by a grove of trees. And drawing my hat low over my brows, I gave myself up to a joy too deep for words, as I contemplated my strange escape. Not once perchance 'in a millicn times could such an attempt have proved successful. The circumstances which favored my escape, (as I afterwards learned,) were these: Dr. N-- - has a man about my   height, very taciturn, and nearly always seen with an essenced kerchief lifted to his face. On the day of my escape, he had found me in a profound sleep, whibh had succeeded a terrible paroxysm, and been summoned' from my cell toa call not far away, where his services were more immediately demanded. While he was in this cell-an hour or more-my escape had been consummated. And-now I was free! But was there no danger of detection in the cars? the conductor came along to collect the fares-I felt my heart jump to my throat. What could I do without money?  , not long ago the owner of half:a million of dollars, now without even a dollar to pay my railroad fare. I put my hand into the pocket of .the black vest which I wore, and drew forth a pocket-book. To'my inexpressible joy it contained some gold and bank-bills- about fifty dollars. I paid'my fare, and, sinking back into my seat, I fell into a pleasant slumber, unbroken by a dream. When I awoke the cars were in Al- bany. I called a coach and directed the coach- man to drive to the -- Hotel, the best in the place, where, entering my name as "Caleb Jenkins," I at once hurried to' my room, which was an elegant parlor, with a bed in an alcove. I directed the servant to bring light and a newspaper, which he did at once, and then I found myself alone. I had not yet looked into a mirror, and T was afraid to do it, afraid that some great change had passed over my face, which it would appall me to behold. I was afraid to look upon the newspa- per; afraid, I could not tell why; I knew that I had not been confined in the Asy- lum for a year, and yet I was afraid that the date of the paper would inform me that I had beeil imprisoned many years. At last, I rose, and took the light, and looked into the mirror.  "O my .God!" was the exclamation which was forced from my lips. Changed, indeed! On that fatal night' I had been a young man; the face-in the mirror, colorless and wrinkled, with great hollows underneath the eyes, was that of a man of middle age. My hair was cut close; it was thick with gray hairs. My beard, which seemed the t  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7091-00000043"/> growth of about three days, was also sprinkled with gray hairs. How many years had passed since that accursed night when I laid thedestroyer of my peace at my feet in his blood? Had I been tried for the crime? Transferred froth the convict's to the madman's cell? I seized the newspaper, and you may be sure that my hands trembled as I held it to the light. The fatal night had occurred in the year 1842-the date of the paper before me was June 10th, 1847. CHAPTER XXXI. FIVE years of my life a blank-a cha- os! I sank back into my chair, and for a few moments surrendered myself to all I  the bitterness of my agony. And Eugenia, what had become of her?' My wealth and estates, in whose hands were they? I paced the floor with clasped hands, and it was some time before I could recover my presence of mind. "But," I said aloud, "we must not go mad again. We have had enough of that. Doubtless, my good wife, after betraying me, consigned me to a mad- house, and then, procuring a divorce with the wealth of the insane husband. married again. A-h!"-I could not help * grating my teeth-" we have need of all our presence of mind. for we have a hard battle to fight." I summoned the servant, and directed him to bring me a barber, and in a few moments that odious dark beard, streak- ed with gray, was removed, from my face. Then, as I was faint from want of nour-  ishment, I ordered a substantial supper in my room, and ate heartily, and drank a glass of undoubted champagne-yes, a  bottle of the amber liquid, topped with a its snowy foam.           ] "Yes, in any case, I will leave this  country forever," I soliloquized, raising , the glass to my lips. "I may find Eu- X genia dead, but it is more probable that 1 I will find her married again, and in pos- session of all my wealth. Let her have  it! There is a curse upon it! It came  from my hag-wife, and will carry a curse wherever it goes. But, in any case, I t must see Eugenia before I leave the 1 country." I  directed the servant to call me in    o time for the bont which left at day- y break for New-Yori, and soon was enjoy- i -ing a pleasant and dreamless sleep. By y daybreak next morning I was on board I of a North River boat to New-York. To i New-YorIk ' viat adventures wouid i ? encounter there? Secluded in my stateroom, I reviewed I my past life, and endeavored to lift the veil which covered five years of it with impenetrable mystery. Had I been tried for the murder? Was there not in my mind a dim, aw- ful memory, vague as a half-obliterated daguerreotype, of a thronged court, my- self in the crminal's place, Eugenia on the witness-stand-of a verdict of guilty and a sentence of death for the crime of deliberate murder? Was this vague im- pression only the wreck of a memory, or the mere figment of an idle dream? If, sentenced for murder, had I, in con- sequence of insanity, been transferred from the condemned cell to the mad- house? What had become of my houses and lands? of my immense Wealth? of-Eu- genia? I bowed my head in very bitterness of soul,--"Ah! untrue to her husband whom she had driven to madness and murder, Eugenia has obtained a divorce and married again! My property has been divided between her new husband and my own greedy relatives. I am like one risen from the grave,-alone, utterly alone,-without a soul to love or care for me in the wide world." There was one thought which cut the deepest-my child! * O imy child! blood of my innermost life; soul of my soull what had become of my child? I hur- ried from my room and paced the deck. How like an old friend, always trusted, and never faithless, the Hudson spread his generous old face before me, bright with the morning sun! iAnd the mountains yonder, stretching away into the western heaven, seemed to bend their pine-clad tops to greet me -I knew them-old memories filled my heart at the sight, and tears came to my eyes. Down the Hudson we glided under that calm summer sky, until the high- lands, grand and mysterious with revo- lutionary memories were passed and broad Tappan Bay lay before us, like a   mirror framed in hills of emerald and gold. And then my gaze roved nervously to the southwest. My home, the gloomy old mansion on the heights was there; there the garden, in which, by the light of the summer moon, I had seen the livid face of the dying man; soon it would be in sight. Pacing the deck with short rapid steps I watched for the first glimpse of it with an intensity that was agony itself. At last it cane in sight, the so5 shin- ing on its steep roofs and embowering trees. Straining my eyes I sought to pierce the shadows of those trees, to look into the old house and see the faces that now gazed upon the gloomy paneled rooms; and of all rooms that in which Eugenia sat on the night of the murder. There were-yes! I could not be mis- taken-there were forms moving in the garden walk, and the white dress of a woman fluttered among the trees. - "Can it be Eugenia!"  The words rose to my lips. The boat glided on, and soon the old mansion was out of sight. 'To the east I turned my gaze, search- ing'for that home by the river shore to  which the young student used to come  in the still dusk to meet that woman who  was a child in her experience, an angel in  her love. And presently it came in sight -a glimpse of it only-through the  thickly clustered foliage:  The sight unmanned me. I sank into 1 a seat, and hid my face in my hands, un- U til it was lost to view.      t We arrived in New-York in the after- c noon. The bustle, the uproar, the tramp  of ten times ten thousand feet, the sea  of faces, always hurrying by, all startled b me like the wonders of some fantastic b dream. New-York was to me as much of a miracle of mad, impetuous life, as n though I had never trod its streets be- s fore. Five years I had passed in a living t grave; and now, confronted with the ever- it changing panorama of New-York life, I ix could scarce believe the evidence of my E eyes and ears.           a Entering my name at a retired hotel in w Courtland-street, I took a carriage, and sl directed the driver to proceed to a cer- cl tain place some miles out of town-in a n word, the home of Eva.       w It was near sunset when the carriage fa 6   d halted in the by-road, near the wood, and in sight of the river. How eagerly o I darted into the wood and followed the path which led to Eva's home! n  I was faint with excess of emotion as i, I reached the garden gate. ' Yes! it was r the same place; true, the garden was e overgrown with weeds; the house, now ;. bathed in the sunshine, was falling to de- s cay, but it was still the place in which I 1 had loved Eva; in which her child had blossomed- into life; in Which mother - and child had been hurried down to death. I sprang through the gate, threaded : my way among tie weeds, and soon stood ; at the door, which evidently had not been I opened for a long time. I knocked-a hollow echo-but no sound of footstep or voice. What had become of the good-hearted Irish woman whom I had left in charge of the place at the time of my marriage with Eugenia? Who was now the own- er of Eva's home . These questionfs rose to my lips, but there was no answer to them. Flinging my weight against the door, I burst it open, and hurried from the cheer- ful sunshine into the damp, close passage. Then, up stairs into the room which was once mine, and which was next to Eva's. Through the broken blinds and torn window curtain, a gleam of sunshine trembled in, and quivered (from the mo- tion of the leaves before the window) upon the picture of the Virgin Mary on the wall. There was my table, the very chair on which I had slept on the night when Eva in the next room was writh- ing in the grasp of murder-table and books and chair were thick with dust, but the room was still the same. I opened the door which led into the next room-Eva's room-you may be sure that my hand trembled. The room was dark, but as I opened the door a belt of sunshine streamed into it, disclosing its details, and-yes! light- ing up the bed in which Eva had slept. Every detail of the room was the same as on the night when Eva died. There was the fireplace in which the taper had stood, flinging its faint ray over the cheek of the sleeping mother and her new-born child; there was the glass which had so often'reflected her joyous face; there the coverlet which had press-  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7091-00000044"/> ed her form, the pillow over which her hair'had wandered in wavy masses. Si- lent, silent, desolate now! Is it a wonder that when the sunlight lit up this dark- ened room that the past came back upon me vivid, overwhelming! Risen suddenly from a living death, I found myself brought face to face -with the holiest memories of my life. There was no eye to look upon me. Why not let my heart take its free course? my ag- ony find relief in tears? I staggered forward. I knelt by the bed, kissing the pillow upon which Evans cheek had rested. " O my God! O my God!"-the words wrung from my heart -sounded strangely in that silent cham- ber. And then from my lips trembled the name of HM who, in-his own person, drank the last drop in the cup of human anguish, and was oftentime, in his awful loneliness-for his sorrow had no one to understand it-cheered by the kind faces and low voices of holy women. His name trembled on my lips, in itself a prayer. I rose-one glance around the place- one glance into my own room, where of- tentime Eva had sat beside me-and I hurried down stairs and from the house, compressing my lip and hiding my eyes with my hand. Oh! beautiful upon the ruined house, upon the garden whose flowers struggled among weeds, upon the river seen in glimpses through the foliage-Oh! holy, and calm and beautiful, upon roof and flower and river, streamed the last rays of the setting sun. And the peach-tree rose in the garden, thick blossoms on every bough, as in the old time it rose; its blossoms now and then, like fragrant snow, tossed by the summer wind into the air. One last look upon the garden and house, and then I turned my back upon the place, a sad, friendless, blasted man. It was quite dark when the carriage rolled into the city. As the glare of the lamps flashed through the window into my face, a new fear rose in my mind. Well, I knew, from many incidents which I had remark- ed in my way through life, how easy it was for covetous relatives to imprison a sane man in a madhouse. "Those who have divided my property   will pursue me, and thrust me once more into a madman's cell. There they will. keep me, until again I am mad indeed. Or, I shall be arrested for murder... I must lose no time-not a. moment. I must put the ocean. between me and this accursed city. But first, at all hazards, I will see Eugenia."  Descending from the carriage, I eia- missed the driver, and bent my steps in the direction of my "grand city man- sion." You may take it for granted that my heart beat quicker'as I came in sight of those lofty walls-of, those familiar windows now lighted from sidewalk to roof. The owner of. half a million dollars standing friendless and a beggar in front of his own palace! It was an incident for those who delight in strong contrasts. Ascending the steps, I rang the bell. A liveried servant appeared, and regarded me with a mixed look, one-fourth curios- ity and three-fourths impudence. "Well sr?" "I wish to see Mrs. Van Warner." "She doesn't live, here. An' I don't know where she does live. This is'Mr. Morton's house." And this was all the satisfaction I could obtain from the gentleman in lace and velvet. He closed the door, and I went sadly down the steps. My own house was, without a doubt, the prop- erty of another man. "The old house in the country!"I cried, "I must 'go there to-night-to- night, as I am a living man."' I was resolved, and lost no time in putting my purpose into execution. Crossing to Jersey City, I procured a coach with little Uelay, and bade the coachman drive to a certain point on. the high road) near my country seat. In less than two hours he set me down near the gate, frpm which the winding- path led to the old house. I paid him his fare, (which reduced my- fortune to ten dollars and some odd change,) and having waited until the carriage was out of sight, opened the gate, and ocok the path through the wood. There was no moon, the night was still, and bathed in calm star-light. I hurried on, trying to banish thought, and choke down the fast-gathering memories, as my footsteps led me near and nearer to the fatal house.   Through the old trees, under the wide branching boughs, as on the night of the murder, 1. hurried on, until the old man- sion came in sight. The garden, the broad walk, and the porch by which the ayipg man had writhed in his last spasn, all were before me in the calm star-light. I paused. for a moment,. and leaned against a tree, in the effort to suppress or to command my emotions. From Eugenia's room, on the ground floor-yes! from the window, half cano- pied by vines-the ray of a fireside lamp trembled out upon the garden, and de- scribed: a belt of light upon the foliage. Treading on tiptoe, 1 approached the window, and looked within. The lamp stood on the workstand, as on the fatal night. and in its light the room, dark paneled walls, sofa, chairs, fireplace, all appeared the same. And a woman dressed in white was seated on the sofa; I could not see her fate, for it was averted, batcher hair was drk---dark as Eugenias--wadiit indeed her?  iMy heart rose to my throat at the thought; and, without a moment's palue,. I glided beneath the lifted sash aM entered the room. In the centre, half-way between the window and sofa, I paused, trembling in every nerve; the woman heard my step and turned' her face to me. It was not Eugenia's. She started to her. feet and: regarded n 'with a look of surprise and fear. "Whom dq you wish to see, sir?" "Pardon me," I hesitated, "but I thought--"I heard the sound of a door opening bhiind nme and of a light foot- step. Why at the sound of that light foot- step did the blood rush in a torrent to my heart?' Slowly I turned. The intruder was a child, a beautiful girl of some five or six years, with black riinglets floating on her shoulders, and large dreamy eyes thait seemed to look at once into your soul'; a very beauti- ful child, who' raised her large eyes to me, with a look in which love seemed to struggle with awe, who made a step for- ward as if about to spring into my arms and then shrunk back again; a child upon whose sinless face there was the stamp of my own features, mingled with th. rich IovTliss of Eugenia's tace.   ' Come here, Mary!"I said, in a low voice, and knelt and gathered the dear child to my arms. She rested there in my bosom, trembling but pleased; and, as I kissed her, she said.-"You look like papa's picture, but you are older.' Her infantile voice was interrupted. by a second footstep. I looked up and b- held EUGEN-IA. Yes, Eugenia stood before me, dressed  in white, and beautifll as ever, save that her form was more rounded and flowing il its outlines, and that the rich maturity of summer had( succeeded. the spring bloom of her cheeks; beautiful as ever, her-dark hair disposed in thick mnnsses about her flce, and her eyes glittering with tunchanging light. She was entering the room, wle1n she beheld a stranger, whose face was hidden from view, gathering her child to his bosom. I raised'my face. She saw me. and, pale as death, stood transfixed to the floor. I said not a word, but gazed upon her steadily. Then. her bosom heaved, a burning. blushcrimsoned her throat. er cheek and brow. She moved her lips, but no sound was heard. She stretched forth her hands and came towards me. "Baok, polluted woman!"I cried. This child. is mine; but, as for you I know you not!  Back!"  The room swam around me, and I fell- like one dead, upon my face. near the feet of my wife. CHAPTER XXXII. OvEsRcoMi by long-continued excite- ment. I had fallen in a fainting fit at the feet of lmy wife. The next sensation thatt I can remem- ber was that of proibund calmness and repose. When I unclosed my eyes, they were saluted by the cheerfil beams of the * summer nmoning, sun, stealing through the half-drawn curtains of my bed. The breath, of flowers imbued'and filled the air. Gazing through the curtains of my bed, I beheld the details of a luxuriously furnished room; the windows were shaded by vines and flowers, trembling on the outside to every breath of-air; a vase of freshy gathered flowers stood on an ebony table near the bed; on another table the massive family Bible,  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7091-00000045"/> in which was recorded my marriage with Eugenia; and directly opposite me, from the wall, smiled a picture which I had. purchased, because it looked like Eva- the same room to which I had led Eugenia when we first entered the gloomy mansion. Raising myself on my pillow, I turned my head on my shoulder, and through the open window beheld the vines and flowers, and the broad Hudson glittering in, the morning sun. It was indeed a beautiful morning, full of the peace and repose of early June.  "If Eugenia were only true; if five years of my life had not been blotted out; if I was not friendless and a beg- ger,"-thus I murmured, but did not complete the sentence. A fatal "if" stood before every hope of peace and happiness. A footstep broke the calm stillness, and I sank back upon the pillow, closing my eyes. Presently, I was conscious that a form was bending over me; that a hand was lightly pressed upon my forehead; that the soft pressure from the lips of a woman who fears to awake a beloved sleeper, was upon my lips and cheek and brow. God knows I trem- bled then! Could it be Eugenia, false to the husband who had made her hap- piness the ambition of his life-Eugenia, whose crime had consigned me to a mad- man's cell? I dared not unclose my eyes. Next, I heard the sound of footsteps stealthily receding from the bed, and ventured to unclose my eyes, and look around. Eugenia, dressed in a flowing morning robe, was bending over the vase of flowers, very beautiful, with her clear brown complexion set in her raven hair; but there was a look of deep sadness on her face. O how earnestly, in that momentary gaze, I devoured every detail of that noble face and form, in which the pure loveliness of the maiden, the matured beauty of the matron, seemed to mingle! and how I gnashed my teeth in very bitterness of soul, as the thought arose, --"That beautiful woman was once my wife; but, faithless to me, is now the wife of another!" And on tiptoe, like a kind nurse, afraid that the slightest movement may awake a fevered sleeper, she moved through the   room, seeming to shed around her an at- mosphere of purity, although I knew her to be false as Satan. Why is it that, although we know a woman to be faithless as incarnate false-. hood itself, yet we can never believe her to be thus when the magnetism of her presence, the clear calm light of her eyes is upon us? A light quick, rapid step, sounded through the room, and the child came bounding to her mother's arms, her face all sunshine, and her ringlets waving in the summer air.  Oh! how her simple words went to my heart!"Is pa awake?" she whispered, pointing to the bed-"Oh! I do so wish he was awake, that I might talk to him." "Hush! He is sleeping, and you must not wake him," whispered the mother, kissing her beautiful child; and they glided to the window and sat down there, the child cradled on the mother's knee, both very beautiful, and as like each other as'the rose-bud, just trem- bling into life, to the rose of summer in ripe bloom. It was a beautiful. picture. Stealthily, for a long time, I gazed upon that picture, until again footsteps dis- turbed the stillness. 'We have come, madam, after our stray patient," said a harsh voice. "Yes! after our poor, distressed rela- tive!" added another voice, not so harsh, but soft and low, and very sneakig. "Our poor distressed relyive! who, day before yesterday, escaped from the Asy- lum. We had some trouble to find hmn, but know that he is here, and will take him back with us." I confess that these voices made the blood run cold in my veins. In one I recognized the voice of Dr. N--, the taciturn physician of the Asylum; in the other, the voice of a rel- ative, who, in the days of my prosperity, had fawnedupon me, but who, despite his sleek exterior, was as complete a. scoundrel as could be found in Wall- street, or in the State Prison. Through an aperture in the bed-cmu- tains, I stealthily surveyed them. Dr. N--   stood, prim as a waxwork figure, his hat held in both hands, his form ar rayed in the changeless black suit and white cravat. As for Isaiah Porgy, my relative, be %   was a man of singular make-very pic- turesque-thin legs, expansive corpora- tion, narrow shoulders, all clad in shiny black; and all over this, placed upon a short apoplectic neckl appeared one of the most singular faces that ever frightened a portrait painter to death-narrow fore- head, on either side of which straggled a lock of unpleasant-looking brown hair, faintly lined brows, small aquiline nose, huge bulging cheeks, with mouth and chin about as big as a hazle-nut, support- ed by a semi-circle of flesh, that possibly might be called a double chin. As for the eyes, they were so small that it is hardly worth while to mention them, were it not to record their expression of simple, unadulterated knavery. It was the mad doctor, (or doctor for the mad,) and Mr. Porgy, who now confronted my wife, that is to say, Eugenia. She rose from her chair, as she saw them, and I remarked that her face had grown very pale. Was she about to consign me once more to-the madhouse? I confess that I felt that the first words she uttered would fix my fate. But she did not speak., "Now you know, madam," said the sleek Porgy, shifting his broad-rimmed hat from one hand to the other, as though it were something hot,-"You know, madam, that since the court ap- pointed me as the nearest relative, one of the administrators, or trustees of the estate of the unfortunate lunatic, (you were the 'tother,) I have had a world of trouble in managing his affairs, and in keeping all things right, and-eh, eh-in fact, madam, to make a long story short, it is best for all parties to take him back at once. He is insane, you know"- "And he stole my clothes," quaintly interrupted the taciturn doctor. Euge- nia spoke; she was very pale, and I noted a tremor of her lip. "Gentlemen, do not speak so loud. My husband is sleeping. I will spealt  with you down stairs ;" and with a quiet gesture of the hand, she pointed to the  door. Could I believe my ears?"M'y hus- band!"And then that calm, proud at- titude; that quietly extended hand; that beautiful face, pale as if from the force of some secret purpose, fixedly resolved  upon. Was this Eugenia, my faithless N wife. r the creation of a feverish dream?    Mr. Porgy did not seem at all inclined to go. 'But, madam," he began, and made a step toward the bed. She quickly placed herself before him. "This is my room, sir," she said, qui- etly, but with flashing eyes. "I will see you down stairs." The doctor had already moved to the door, and Mr. Isaiah Porgy followed him, very reluctantly, stepping backward, like a man who retreats before a hot iron held near his nose by another man. They'left the room, and my wife-if I can call her so-took her child by the hand and followed them. How nervously I awaited the result of the interview! how I longed for her reappearance! An hour passed - it seemed an age-and she did not come. Through the still summer air, I heard voices in the room below-now, the mo- notonous voice of the doctor; now, the calm, clear voice of Eugenia, and now the voice of Porgy, which gradually He- came blustering and violent. To rise, to hurry on some clothes, to hasten down stairs and confront the scoundrel, now became my prominent desire; but, in the effort to leave the ed, I sank back exhausted on the pil- low. "And it could do no good," was my bitter thought, "I am not master, only a beggar here." At last the voices died away, and Eu- genia reappeared. She came into the room with a rapid step. She was pale and agitated, her bosom rose and fell, and one side of her face was swept by her loosened hair. There were traces of tears upon her cheeks. "No! no!-I will not consent!"I heard her whisper. "I will die first!" A sudden impulse prompted me to speak. "To what will you not consent?" I said; they were the first calm words [ had addressed to her for five long years. She paused in her walk, and re- garded me witf a look in which surprise was only a single element. CHAPTER XXXIII. "FR ANCIS!" she said in a low voie, 'are you well?.are you strong? 'that is, well enough and strong enough to con- verse with me about your affairs? I  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7091-00000046"/> had proposed to defer this conversation until you had recovered your usual strength. -But, if you can converse now, it will be all the better." I silently took her hand, but she with- draw hers; and, crossing the apartment, took some papers from the drawer of a bureau. Then she came back again, and seated herself near, on the edge of the  bed. "Since you were first taken ill, this man, your relative--," (she pointed to the name of PoRGY, which appeared on the back of a paper,) "and myself'have been, by -the appointment of the court, joint trustees of your estate. Here is an-account of-my stewardship-" She Pilaed the paper, covered with writing in ifer own hand, in my grasp. 'Asfor Aim, -he has done his best to obtain pos- sssion of your property. H have had oae continued battle with him for five years. 'He-was here this morning. He fears that you have -recovered your heUtth, and knows that, once recovered; you will call him to account. Therefore, he affects to believe that you are still- still-" she did not say insane-"' still far from well, and wishes to consign you to the Asylum again. Now, here are all the papers, which -show the exact po- Aition of your affairs. Asa soon as you can hold a pen, petition the court that you may be reinstated in possession of your property. And-.,--" "And so," I interrupted her, " you do not believe that I am still insane?" She regarded me earnestly with her expanded eyes. "I do not. All that you need is physical strength, and that will soon return." I could not help laying my hand gently on her arm. "'Well! suppose me reinstated into my property,-you will reinstate me in the happiness which I enjoyed;five years ago?" Her gaze fell. "As soon as all is well 'with you," she said, in a low soice, "I will take my child and leave you; my shadow shall not once cross your path- way-" "Then you are guilty2"I said, bit- terly. "Innocent before heaven, Francis!" 'was her reply, given firmly, and with an unfaltering gaze. '"T lid ndot. then. on that fatal sum-   mer night, five years ago, see you in the arms of another man, resting on his neck, your forehead warmed by his kisses? It was all a dream, then?" ' It was no dream," and her face grew paler. ":But, Francis! hear:me once for all! Albert Monroe was the only son of the gentleman in'whose family -I found a home. He loved me,rbut I never loved hinm-in :any ligght-save as a brother. A short time before I left my New- England home to come; to New-York in search of my lost brother, Albert de- parted on a long voyage--to China, I believe, as supercargo of a merchant- ship. News came of his death-news which had-every appearance of truth, and which was believed by lis family and myself. And when, on that fatal night, I saw him, whom I thought long since dead, standing near me, appearing. like a ghost, without a wprd or sound to announce his oeeo g, it was surprise. mingled with tffection for a long-lost brother, whichi brought me, for a mo- ment, and a moment only, to his arms. Had you seen all, you 'would have;seen me, as soon ars I recovered my self- possession, retreat from Ihis arms, and in-answer to -his reproaches about rny marriage yon would :have heard me -command him to-leave the -room and the house. This, Francis! is -the simple truth." Ier firm accent, 'her clear, unfater- ing look, the .expression which hung upon every line of her beautiful face, all confirmed her words. But still, there was a doubt, a latent bitterness in my heart. "And then you are not marriedagain?" I said. She did not answer me with words, but with a look-a look which said more than words, and which -Lean- not describe. Her lips were, for the moment, compressed, and her eyes flash- ed, as though her soul was in their glance. Then she turned her face away, and a single tear rolled down the half- averted .cheek, glittering there like a star. "When you are well again"-her voice was scarcely audible-"I and my child will leave you." "That is, you will leave the xmurderer to the full enjoyment 'of his wealth and his remorse?"I said. "Murderer!" and she fixed her ey-   full upon me. "Have you not heard that Albert Monroe recovered, and is now a thousand miles away, in the en- joyment of all that worldly prosperity can offer?"These words made my brain reel; a starving wretch, suddenly informed of his-accession to a fortune of a million dollars, could not have been bewildered with a madder joy than now bounded through my veins. "Albert Monroe living!"I ejaculated, and sank back upon the pillow, while every fibre of my being was filled with gratitude-unutterable thankfulness to od. A cloud was lifted from my soul. Like a prisoner suddenly led forth from the dungeon in which for years not one ray of light had visited him, I felt my- self blinded by the sunshine which all at once shone in upon my darkened soul. After a long pause, in a. low voice I spoke,-"Freed from the remorse which haunts the murderer, and placed once more in possession of my estates, why will you leave me, Eugenia 7" Her face was very beautiful, but very sad, as she answered me: "Because, Francis, there will always be a doubt, a suspicion in your inner- most heart. Even while pressing me to your arms, and gazing upon the face of our child, you will be haunted by a fear which you cannot banish or control- that your wife has been false -to you. You have a noble nature, Francis but in its depths lurks one element, which, at timeA, poisons and overshadows your whole nature-an element which I can scarcely call by name, but which may be called doubt, fear, suspicion! It is, therefore, well-" and that %omething in her look which, when first I taw her, I could not analyze, now came over her face,--"It is, therefore, well that we should live apart; we will think kindly of each other, and the slightest portion of your immense wealth will suffice for me and our child. You will be happier when I am away, and when my presence no longer brings a doubt that harrows your inmost soul." While she spoke I gazed upon her earnestly, thinking of the time when I had first met her, of the first happy year of our marriage, of the day when our child first blossomed into being; and felt my love for her roll back in a flood   in all its force upon my heart. But I said calmly-as calmly as I could-"You have -spoken my fate, Eugenia!"-and turned my face from the light. Not another word'passed between us; after a long pause she rose, and I heard her footsteps die away. That day, I sent for an able lawyer, and, after a long interview with himn suc- ceeded in putting measures afoot, which in a few days, spite of Porgy and all doubts, would place me once more a sane man in possession of my estates. Three days passed, and although often, while I seemed to be asleep, I felt upon my brow the pressure of Eugenia's hand, her kiss upon my lips, and felt unutter- able joy at the consciousness that she was pear-me, still not a word passed between us. But my child often-yeq! nearly always-was near me, and in my arms. loving me as though she had seen me every hour since her birth. O how like peace from God to a heart chafed by the bitterness of life-its hard experience, its broken friendships, its loves buried in treachery or death- comes the vision of the face of a sinless child. And how like bitterness frcm 'he deeps of hell comes the thought that, one day, that fair young face, lovely as those child- faces which long ago smiled in the Sa- vior's embrace, will be hardened in every outline by the iron hand of experience, wearing on the cheek the feverish flush of this world's loves and hates, and burn- ing in the eyes with the light of this world's passions, or the glare of its des- pairs l The third day I was strong again; my mind was clear, and every pulse was full of strength and life. Dressing myself in the apparel which l6had worn five years before, I looked in the glass, and found that, although it was seamed with wrin- kles, and crowned by dark hair streaked with gray, upon its every outline there was the calm manhood which a noble resolution imparts. I had taken my resolution, and said I to myself-"This day, as sure as the sun shines, I will fulfil it." My lawyer came early in the morning; and, after a long interview in my chamber, departed, first, however, leaving in my hands papers which re-established me in possession of  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7091-00000047"/> T:.,- c:-:t er. The petition of my wife, c!:i:jiIcd with, that of Porgy, (for this :,;d gentlemanb had, by my lawye been -  : ought or frightened into acquiescence.) hadI been answered by the proper court, rnd I was once more mnyself. owner of sonething more than half a million of dollars. After the lawyer left, I took my hat and cane, and descended to the sitting- room of my wife, through whose opened window were seen the leaves quivering in the sunshine, and the broad Hudson glittering like molten gold. There was a lady there-the same whom I had seen the night of my return--the governess of my chid. I requested her to call Eugenia. and was presently alone in that quiet room, through whose window on the fatal night, I had looked and been driven mad by what I saw. Seated on the sofa, hat and cane in hand, I anxiously awaited the appearance of Eugenia. My resolution was taken, and although it was fixed, still I felt agitated as the moment of its execution drew near. At last Eugenia came, dressed in white, her rich black hair gathered plainly aside from her face. Surpassingly beautiful, she was very pale, and looked at me with surprise in her clear deep eyes. "Sit by me for a moment Eugenia," I said as calmly as I could, " wish to say a few words to you." She sat down on the sofa near me, her hands crossed in front of her form, her eyes gazing not upon me, but on the leaves without, bathed in sunshine, and her glossy hair touched by the softened  ray which came through the closed cur- ] tains. Beautiful as a queen. and trem- bling as a child.  "I wish to say a few words to you, and I wish you to isten to me calmly.  Will you?" "I will, was her faint response. I I have discovered that, during my five years5 sickness-nayv call it mad-  ness-instead of plunging into the gay world, and gathering the enjoyments offered by almost boundless wealth, you i preferred to be true to the memory of a v madman; and, yes! came often to sit 1 for hours and days a silent watcher by i the madman's couch. This you did, Eu- i genia, and never told me of it." I paused, but her gaze was still fixed on the flowers,    which, without the window, trembled in the morning sun. "(-Why did you not tell me of it, Eugenia, on my return?" Her voice was scarcely audible as she replied,-"It was not worth while. In taking care of your-property, I simply did my duty. to our child. In watching by you in your sickness, I endeavored to make some atonement for the suffering which I had caused you. And her face grew paler, her bosom heaved beneath its snowy vestment, but still she did not turn her gaze upon me. Well," I resumed," well, Eugenia, the past is with the past, and cannot be re- called or changed. The present is with us, and we must deal with things as they are. It seems we cannot live together; we must part." "We must part," she echoed in a low voice, "But you-you-will not-take our child from me?  I did not seem to note that last remark, uttered with a quivering lip, but con- tinued,-"We cannot live under the same roof. That is true. But it shall not be said that I only came back to thrust mother and child from these walls. No! Eugenia, no! One will go forth; and that one shall be myself; and I will go forth alone, leaving you secure in posses- sion of my wealth, happy in the love and presence of our child!" And at the word, determined to fill my resolution at all hazards, I .rose, hat and cane in hand, and moved a step toward the door.   a Eugenia rose with me, seized my hand with both of hers and confronted me her eyes expanded and glittering, while her face wFs perfectly colorless.  "'Stop! For God's sake, stop!" she gasped and wrung my hand. But I tookmy hand from her. "Euge- nia, my determination is taken. Do not try to change it. Believe it is best for all of us!" I pushed her gently aside, and, with a rapid step, moved to the window, and in a moment was in the open air. I did not once look'back, but, plunging into the path which led through the wood, walked rapidly on, banishing every thought but this-"My determination w taken-it is best for all parties-and it is final." And under the boughs, rich with foli- age; over the path where sunlight and   shadow chased each other; over a carpet of grass and flowers, I hurried on. There was a point where, from the foot of an aged oak, (encircled by a rude bench,) you could obtain a glimpse of the Hud- son and the distant city. Here, for an instant, I paused; and, gazing on the distant waves, and upon the city's spires, sank into a reverie upon my past and future life. My reverie was broken by the abrupt rustling of a bough; by the low sound of footsteps on the velvety sward. I looked up; my wife stood before me, pale as death, her hair unbound and wa- ving onher shoulders, while her bosom heaved with agitation. By her hand she led our child, who sprang forward, her arms outspread, and my name ringing on her lips. From her agitation, Eugenia could not speak, but stood silent and pale and trembling before me. As for myself I could not help sharing her agitation. At length, she said a single word, Francis!" in a faint voice, and pointed to the old mansion whose roof was visible through the trees,--" that is our home!" And she bent her head upon my breast, and put her arms about my neck, while our child clung to my knees. "That is our home!" And here-in the June sunshine, the drapery of the foliage about us, as wife lings once more to husband, child to father-here let the curtain fall. You may be sure that I did not go forth alone, friendless into the wide world that day, nor next day, nor any day. Let no words attempt by description to mock the unutterable joy of that moment when trembed on my ear the sentence, That is our home!" A few words more will bring my con- fessions, as "A MAN OF THE WORLD,' to a dose. It is Sabbath-day, and the summer sah hines upon the distant spires of the ,1    city. But we do not go to church in the shadows of those distant spires;. our church is here, in the old mansion in our  home.  The  sunlight  trembles through the vine-canopied window into our quiet sitting-room. Eugenia, in the: bloom of her matronly beauty, sits by me; upon her knees the open Bible, from which she has just read a lesson of the Gospel. And by me, as I write, stands MARY, with ten summers shining from her eyes-those eyes which repeat the loveliness and purity of her mother. In this calm moment let me give a passing word to certain actors in these confessions. The poor girl by whose hands Burley Hayne met his death, ac- quitted perchance by a partial jury, dwells once more in her New-England home. Edward, once the " boy-burgler," is now the graduate of awell-known col- lege. Maria takes charge of my city mansion. As for myself, behold me I after all my trials, seated in my home, crowned with blessings of which I am all unwor- thy; wife by my side, and child resting on my arm. "Come hither, Mary, child, and let me look up in your face! May Ood's bless- ing and  your aother's goodness be yours all the days of your life; and may -and may-the spirit of EVA, from the better land, stretch forth her arms to guide and guard you, Mary!" END OP THU CONF8USIONS OF A MAN 01 THU WOBLD. [NOTE BY TH E DITOR or TBUSS PAPIRS.-It will be perceived that the "Life of a Man of the World" ends well, although perchance his mingled crmes and virtues merited a darker termination. He has told his story in his own way-a narrative of real life, with all its lights and shadows, and mingled impulses of good and evil. From this strange life every reader can draw the proper mor- al. Many a better man than Francis Van Warner, (or the person whose real name is concealed under this fictitious one,) has met with a worse fate in the living world around us; and many a worse man has existed in the same living world, committing all his faults without one ray of hip virtues.  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7091-00000048"/> MARGARET DUNBAR.   CHAPTER XXXTV. AMONG-the .unexplained mysteries .of city:life, none are more appalling than those we  often find .dimly hinted at in ;henewspapers, in paragphs like the following: 'at/day^eniugthe'botiy-oan unknownamn, fatirely4ivretof clothing, was found Aoating in the North River, Pier No. -. His hair was dark, and 'heappeared' to 'be about thirty years of age.

It was, afterthe inqueat, Jprlery interred in Potters Field." Suih:par graphs,' badly worded, and as terse-as yourcall uion a waiter'for another plate of minffing, or -as the sentence of death pronouncedin a criminal court by sjudge alxious for his dinner, frequently: appear in the papers. What do they mean? There is something infinitely horrible: in 'the manner in which the histly--of the unknown deed is thus dispatched in' en-brief lines, ending with,-"' verdict-of 'oroner jury, thrown into the river by' reaurreationits," and "'properly interred in Potter's Field." ' The above paragraph ippeared inmost f the .city papers not:many years ago, say some time in the summer of 1852. What;did it mean I Did 'it erbody the real story -of the unknown's fate? Was he, indeed, nothing more than the abandoned prey of resurrectionists, thrown by them  into the river, or was he the victim. of some unknown mur- derer? Paragraphs like the above often appear in the papers; let us take this *ingle one, and probe the mystery which it hides. On a dreary winter night in 1848-49,   there was the light of a happy hearth- side playing about a home in Broome- street, half-way between Broadway and the North River. A two-storied Ihouse built of -dark red stone, stands a little apart from the stret,'from which it is separated by the fragment of a garden. The garden is now buried in snow, and the wind whirls the flakes against the windows, through whose closely- drawn curtains a. softened ray streams out upon the desolate night. 'Look through the window-curtains, and you will behold :a scene hiich contrasts plea- santly with the storm and darkness of the drear winter evening. 'A mother, hose dark hairs are veined with the Silver threads of fifty years, sits in a' rocking-chair near the fire her hands folded, and her eyes 'fixed upon the daughter, the only child,who stands near 'her. The daughter, dressed .in plain black, is .a giil of some seventeen years, a little above the medium height, with a rounded form .clear complexion and luxuriant brown hair. Her eyes- dark hazel and very large-express a noble, a passionate and stainless soul. 'By no means perfectly beautiful, she is yet a woman whose roundly developed form, rich brown hair, and face lighted by eyes that shine clearly and steadily would at once enchain your gaze,'whether you first met her among the crowds of the sidewalk, or in the quietude of the parlor. And while her mother's gaze is fixed upon her, in all the warmth of a mother's love, her gaze is centered upon the young man by her side, whose hand she holds with both hers-a man in the prime of young manhood, with bold features, a bronzed complexion, dark hair, scattered carelessly over his forehead, and blue eyes, full of hope and life. He is neatly   and plainly clad in black, and a black *cravat tied loosely gives you a glimpse of his muscular throat. '.But you may die!'" are the first words which we hear from the lips of the young girl. "My heart trembles, Harry, as I think of the ten thousand dangers before you." ' Die?"There's no such word in my' dictionary!" cries the young man in a frank, joyous voice. "Is there mother? The fevers on the Isthmus-the wild life in California-the odd sort ofpeople I will meet in the mines-none of these things frighten me. I will go through all these things unscathed, and within a year from to-night come back rich Do you hear me, Margaret 7" Now, altheugh the young man called the' gray-haired woman mother, she was' not his mother, only tobe his mother-in- law. Margaret was his betrothed wife. He was:about to leave the quiet routine of his lifeas a:house-carpenter, and'make one hold effort for fortune in California. ".But why need you go?" said Marga- ret sadly. "Why not remainl? Your wages are ,good; and, with what I can make by the needle, there is no douht but that we can make our h6bmehappy. Think of what agonies of suspense I will suffer in the year of your absence." 4 Remain!" echoed Harry, patting his hand lightly upon her brown hair.. Re- main! Drive a jack-plane and pay rent all my life? Walk- these streets all my, days the slave of two masters-' boss ' and landlord-when there is a fortune for me in California? Believe me, Margaret, for your sake more than mine, I'll do no such foolish thing. Don't you think'I'm right,.mother?" "There is a Providence in California, as well as in this city," was the mother's reply; " and though I dread the thought of your going, still I think it best for us all. You will come back with a compe- tence-" "Certainly I will," cried Harry; " and then, Margaret, darling, we will be mar- ried-" The young girl made no reply at first; but, placing her hand on his shoulder, looked up silently into his face, her cheeks all aglow, and her eyes all clear and bright. ".Liviug I will be true to you, Harry, -and if you--you die, I will be true to   your memory!"So low was the "ton in which she spoke, that-the mother did not hear it, but the lover heard :it with his ears and bheart; -and, silently press- ing the hand of his betrothed, surveyed her with his frank, earnest gaze. A very beautiful ;picture--that simple 'home, with its unostentatious furniture, and cheerful hearthside fliame, '#hose light falls upon the faces of the mother, the betrothed husband and, wife-a:pio- ture which it may be well for us to look upon long 'and yearningly, for it may never in their lives be seen again. 'hat night passed away, and the eat day and the day 'after. Henry Morgan, with Margaret always by: his ide, made swery preparation'for'is CGaliforn enterprise At length the day came; 'the steamers to leave near sunset, and Henry, with Margaret on his Arm, walked tfoth in Broadway an hour before the time of his departure. How many vows werexechanged--hhow many hopes and fears df the future, rose to the lipsin low-spoken words,'as'they hurrietdthroTigh-the ever-trolling, never- resting current 'of 'Broadway r! 'His trunks were all-aboard-; -his ticket in his pocket; -he hadaliddew' gooSdby" to the mother; nothing-remained but to say the same to thegood, beautiful girl, who clung to his arm, and lookediup into his face. He- often said,-- Only'a year-l -will come back rich!" but, somehow, he could not say "Good-by'!" The bronzed face of the carpenter man- ifested a strange mingling of emotion. and of the effort to hide'it; -and, at last, an idea seemed to strike Tiim, which, 'he thought, would relieve him from many difficulties. He led Margaret from the glare and tu- mult of Broadway into 'retired Street, 'and up the steps of a two-story house, and rung the bell; and was ushered into a dimly-lighted parlor. Before Marga- ret could ask the meaning of this move- ment, a grave gentleman appeared bi the parlor, very short in stature, mild in fae, and very decided in the whiteness of his cravat. "What do you wish with me ."-- a bland, kind vdice-"Ah!" glancing at the face of Harry, who blushed a little, and at Margaret's. which was scarlet as a )summer rose.-"Ah! I see how it is '  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7091-00000049"/> ZMarry us, if you please," said Harry -" right away--I'e got to start for Cal- ifornia in half an hour." "But Harry-"Margaret began; but Harry put his hand on her pretty lips, and the clergyman, after the proper pre- liminary questions, went through the ceremony, and presently pronounced them husband and wife. The thing was done so quickly that Margaret and Harry, who had always looked upon it as a matter requiring much time and many words, could scarce believe their senses.' But, in that dimly-lighted parlor, where a few weak rays of sunlight came through the faded blinds, Harry saw the face of the blooming girl beside him whose mingled tears and blushes looked like the mingled bloom and dew of some ungathered rose-took her to his arms, pressed his kiss upon her lips and cheek, and with a muttered "Good-by, Marga- ret! I'll be back in a year-rich-rich," -hurried from the room. Hurried away from the room and house, like a thief leaving his young wife, weeping on the sofa, with the kind old clergyman by her side; hurried down the narrow street, his hat drawn low upon his forehead, and did not look behind him until he stood upon the steamer's deck. (As,a matter of historical justice, it may be as well to record the fact that, before leaving the room, he slipped a ten-dollar gold piece into the preacher's hand.) And as the steamer went down the Bay, which, in the smile of the setting sun showed all its "white caps" topped with flashes of bright gold, Harry sadly paced the dect, his hands deep in his pockets, and his eyes turned yearningly over his shoulder toward New-York, which distance and shadow soon gather- ed in their embrace. As the last gleam of sunset, trembling on fast-fading Trinity spire, met his back- ward gaze, while, through the Narrows, the ocean opened, bleak and vast and cold before him, Harry dashed the tears from his eyes with the knuckles of his his sun-burnt hand, and gave some utter- ance to his feelings in these words,- "Bad papers, this! Marry a young wife, and then quit for Californey! Bad pa  ers! Never mind; in a- year I'll .come bak from -Californey. and come back rich!"   r  And as the steamer went forth gallant- - ly into the cold black night, Harry gazed earnestly through the gathering dark- t ness toward New-York, but did not see , the woman who, clasping the Battery railing with b'oth hands, followed the pro- gress of her husband with heaving bosom and expanded eyes, glittering through their tears. She waited there until the cold night domed with countless stars, gathered round her, and then turned sadly home- ward murmuring oftentimes her hus- band's words,--"Never mind! In a year I'll come back from Californey, and come back rich!" - Well! a year, a long, long year pass- ed, and Henry Morgan did not come back from California rich. In fact, did not come back at all. In his place appeared a line among the California news of the New-York Tub (a paper devoted to the adroitly mingled worship of Good Lord! and Good Devil!) -a line which said a good deal in a few words,-"Died in the mines, August 29, 1849, Henry Morgan, Carpenter, from Nfew-York." Need we tell the agony of one woman who read this line, and who, in the depth of her despair, clung to the hope that, like most things which appeared in the New- York Tub-"' reliable news" to-day, and "infamous fabrications" to-morrow-- it would turn out a baseless falsehood? For a year she clung to this hope, but Henry Morgan did not appear. Another weary year!-every hour spent in the an- guish of suspense, and every item of Cali- fornia news devoured with straining eyes -still no word of Henry Morgan. 1851 followed '49 and '50, and a re- turned Californian,^very much the color of gamboge in face, and with much coin of the same color in pocket, brought word of Henry Morgan. He had seen him on the fatal day, August 2, 1849, propped up against a tree, friendless and uncared for, a beautiful landscape all about him, but the ashy color of death upon his face. Satisfied that the man was beyond all need or hope of help, the returned Californian had left him there to die. And that was the last of poor Henry Morgan!  Time passed on. and it was November in 1852. As night set in upon the town-a   dreary night, full of winteiLnd of the aroina of election in !nd-bills-a steamer, just arrived from tRe Isthmus, lay puffing and blowing, like an exhausted whale, at a certain pier on the North River. Among the many wretches who crawl- ed from the "Calcutta black-holes," which, by a strong flight of speech, are called "berths," was one who came eagerly on deck. and hurried ashore as soon as the steamer was made fast to the pier. He left his dingy trunks (which had escaped the robbers of the Isthmus, per- chance, to fall into the hands of the "gold-dust Peters" of Broadway) aboard, and made the best of his way up a dark street toward the great thoroughfare. As he passes through the light of an occasional lamp you can look at him. At first sight, he strikes with a vivid impression of general and confirmed "hairiness." Tall, broad-shouldered, clad in an old coat which might have been worn in the ark, underneath which ap- peared a shirt of dingiest red, with boots reaching half-way to his waist, he was as hairy as any ten reformers. Long locks of dark-brown hair, innocent of Phalon, swept his shoulders, and were blown to and fro beneath his slouched hat by the sharp November wind; and a beard as uge as a lion's mane, and as black-as black--as the candidate of any political party which you don't like -hid his throat and a portion of his brawny chest. He was evidently a strong man, some- what reduced and thinned by the Isth- mus fever. That glimpse of his face, which his copious hair and beard permitted to be visible, was as yellow as a guinea, and his dark blue eyes. although brght and glittering, had sonething of the " gold- piece" hue about each pupil. Whoever this man was who now plunged into the crowd of Broadway, like a bit of savage life suddenly planted in the midst of city civilization, one thing is certain, his own mother would not have known him. "There's the Park," he muttered, gazing about him, and much jostled by the crowd, " and there's Stewart's, and this is Broadway, and I'm in town again! I have come back from Californey, and come back rich!"   And, placing his hand beneath his rough coat, he touched a massive gold chain, worth some hundreds of dollars, and curiously formed of pure ore to which was attached a gold watch which he had purchased in San Francisco for two hundred dollars. Then he felt the gold pieces which filled his capacious pocket. '"All safe! and then a snug fortune in. the trunks aboard the steamer is safe too-and-I am   in town, .and richl' And-and--f--" here was the hard point to get over-" if I only find the folks alive and well!" And so, urged by that ugly "if!" he made the best of his way through Broad- way, and then turned off into Broome- street, and did not pause until he stood in front of a two-story house, which stood a little apart from the street. Through its curtained parlor windows lightsv ere cheerfully shining. The Californian wenttlrough the lit- tle garden, and up the steps, and rang the bell. He was a strong man, but he trembled like a leaf, as he stood in the dark, awaiting an answer. It seemed an age until the door opened; but, at last, the door did open, and a face appeared. Alas! it was a strange face-that of a robust servant girl. "Does Mrs. Dunbar live here?" fal- tered the Californian. "Faith, she does not. It is Misthress Smith who lives here,"-and' she made great eyes as she beheld, by the light which she carried, the uncouth, quite barbarian exterior of the stranger. "She used to live here; she occupied the rooms on the lower floor-a widow; her daughter was a seamstress," faltered the Californian. "How long since?" "Well-well--" hesitated he, "about three years since." "Three years! Faith, a great many things may happen in three years! Mrs. Smith moved here two years ago, and I've lived with her ever since." And af- ter another fearful look at the barbarous exterior of the Californian, she shut the door in his face. The man went sadly down the steps, muttering gloomily,-"Very bad papers! What if they should all be dead?" It was a thought hard to look at with any calmness; and the Californian tried  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7091-00000050"/> to ainish it and choke it down, as he re- traced his steps toward Broadway. It then occurred to him, that it would be a judicious thing, before proceeding further in his search, to remove some of the hair and beard which made a wilderness of his face. Full of this idea, the Californian pro- ceeded to a fashionable barber shop, (called a saloon,) where, by the light of gas shining into any number of mirrors, and over countless bottles of hair oil. about a dozen gentlemen who spoke bad 'English and wore white aprons, were doing all sorts of things to all sorts of people's heads. There was a red-headed man being carefully dyed into black; a man of fifty. with-gray whiskers and bald head, being elaborately transfonred into a, young man of twenty-five, with neat black whis- kers and soft; curling, brown hair; and a youth of nineteen, with an innocent face and long hair, being scientifically curled for a fancy ball. The Californian drop- ped into -a chair, and submitted his hair and beard to the-scissors and- razors of an august person of trench origin, This accomplished, he rose and sur- veyed himself in a glass, and hair andi beard haing been brought down to the limits of city civilization, the Californian recognized in the mirror, with evident delight, the face of Henry Morgan-a - faee very sallow and gold-colored, but still the face of our old' friend Henry Morgan. "Well, Harry, you do look something like yourself! A white shirt collar, and a suit of black cloth, will. set you up. And"-here, Harry's attention was sud- denly arrested by a paper which fluttered to his feet. It was a letter which lead fallen from the hands of a person near him; Harry took it up, in order to hand it to the person, when his eye was ar- rested by its superscription.-"- Mraraet Dunbar."            r "What!" he said, before taking- time for a second thought, "what do you know about Margaret Dunbar!" and confront- ed the individual who had dropped the letter.- This individual merits a passing glance. He was (to speak in general terms) one of those mysterious, well-dressed people whoni you meet every day in Broadvay, and who are mysterious be- - S \ \   cause noAde can tell where, all those fine clothes, Fl-glasses, and gold chains, come from. To speak more specifically, he was a man of about thirty-five years, above --the medium height, with a well-knit form, clad in dark broadcloth; a ghld chain strayed over his red velv et vest, and on his faultless shirt-bosom shone a very brilliant diamond pin. As to his face, with its short hair and whiskers, black as jet and well oiled, it struck you at first sight. The cheek-bones were a little too high, the nose too sharp, the chin too pointed, and the lips too thin; the keen eyes, glittering under a broad, low fore- head, and poorly defined eyebrows, were altogether too small; and yet it was a healthy, ruddy fate, with a sort of ro- bust manliness- in every line of it. "What do you know of Margaret Dunbar?" said Morgan, holding the let- ter:        -  The individual smiled, disclosing teeth whose whiteness was quite sepulchral. "And may I ask what in the deuce do. you know about Margaret Dunbar,?" he ssaid very pleasantly, as the stranger drew over his shouklers a. cloak richly lined with velvet. CHAPTER XXXV. "AND?' said the strangt gentleman, as he drew his velvet-lined cloak over his shoulders,-"And what in- the deuce do you know about Margaret. Dunbar?" To which Harry, somewhat taken aback by the cool manner of the gentle- man, replied, after a little hesitation,- "Know about her?'"Why, God bless you! she is my wife!" And drawing- the individual a little aside4 near a mirror which reflected their widely different faces. he told him,'in his frank, honest way, the whole story: how he had loved Margaret-married her an hour before his departure for California -been delayed there. by circumstances, over which-he had no control, three years instead of simply one-how he had come back rich, with money enough to make Margaret' comfortable all her days-;- and- -  ' The fact is, here I am, a little yel- low, and a little broken down, but with the rocks, you see? And I can't, find   my wife! God help me! -ie is not dead; is she?" The frank manner of Harry evidently gavy the well-dressed stranger a favora- ble impression of him, which perhaps was not lessened by the story of the trunks, (packed with gold dust,) aboard the steamer, to say nothing of a glimpse of the heavy gold chain which encircled Harry's sunburnt throat. He showed his white teeth in a pleasant smile. "Sit down, Mr. Morgan!" and he point- ed to a sofa near the mirror. "I've often heard Margaret speak of you. And the fact is, I am her cousin. My name is Barke, Stanley Burke. Now you cer- tainly have heard- Margaret speak of me '" Harry was not quite sure that he had, but still .there was a floating impression upon his mind about one Stanley Burke, a member of a wealthy branch of the Dunbar family. Yes! he was sure that he had heard Margaret speak. of him a hundred times. "Yes; I have heard her speak of you -and--" his voice was thick, his blue eyes moistened with something that was very like a tear-" and she is not dea, is she?" How he bent forward, and looked Stanley Burke in the fite. on his eager- ness to hear his reply! ihat gentleman suffered the velvet-lined cloak to drop a little from his shoulders, as he replied,- "Dead! bless you, no!' It was only yes- terday morning I saw her, aive and well, and --.  Harry did not like to ask the question which rose to his'lips, "She is not mar- ried; is -she?" it choked him only to think of it. So- he blunted forth another question,-"A rumor came home that I was dead, I believe. Margaret never be- lieved it, eh?" "She wears black for you now."' was the response of Stanley Burke. "The poor girl will be mad to see you; in fact, unless- properly prepared for the intelli- gence, it will drive her mad to know that you are alive-m-ad with joy, you under- stand'?"  Harry leaned back upon the sofa like a man suddenly overcome by irreparable calamity, or overwhelming joy. For a moment he was dim- of sight; all sorts of ringing sounds were in his ears. The memory of three years of hard adventure   in California, in which he had seen strv-. ation, death, and crime, in their ugliest shapes; the consciousness that he had come back rich, all faded away before the thought, "'Margaret is: living! Margaret is true to me!" And as soon-as he recovered his speech he did a very bad thing; he- gave some vent to his feelings in an oath, which properly looked into was not so much of an oath as a prayer. And then he talked with Stanley Burke for at least an hour, and the man- ner of the well-dressed gentleman quite won his confidence. It seemed as though they had been acquainted for years. Margaret had' removed from Broome- street, and was living with her mother further up town. The death of a distant relative, who had made Margaret his heir, placed them in very comfortable circumstances. She was nolonger forced to strain her eyes, all- day and late at night, at her needle. She was, sad and melancholy about Harry's death, but still young and blooming, and with a faint hope in her heart that he wonud'yet return. Such was the story of Mr. Alfred Stanley, which he told in. many words. and in the blandest manner, with every kind of display of his white teeth, and a steady twinkle of his smallglitter- ing eyes. "('Andthis letter, which by chance drop- pedtfrom my hand,"-he quietly held the letter before Harry's eyes,--"is one which I wrote to her about a year ago giving, her some hope. of your retarn - The fact is, I had heard some favorable news. But, before I could send it to her, I met her in person, andso there was. no use of giving it to her. I threw it in my trunk; and to-dayit must have been taken by me from the same trunk, with- some legal papers which I wished to examine. I did not know it was about me until it dropped from my pocket. It has turned out quite a lucky circumstance, for it has been the means of bringing you and me 'together. Would you like to look at it?" "Not to-night-not to-night," replied Harry. '"First of all I want to see Mar- garet. You will take me at once to her residence?" It would have been better for Harry -much better-had he looked into that letter! "The fact is, Margaret and her mother  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7091-00000051"/> are out of town on a visit to a relative who lives near Tarrytown," replied Stan- ley Burke, quietly depositing the letter jn his pocket-book; " but," he continued as he observed Harry's down-fallen coun- tenance, "they'll be back to-morrow. I can prepare them for your appearance. By George! an idea strikes me. Why not go up there to-night with your traps and trunks, so as to be on hand at the time of their return. You see, I'm not often in town, but when I am, Mrs. Dun- bar gives me a spare room, which you and I can occupy to-night. I have a night-key which will let us in." And the well-dressed man, looking at Harry all the while, passed his hand over his spotless shirt-bosom, through his well-oiled whiskers and short-cut hair, a pleasant smile, meantime, lighting up his masked face. It was. a good idea-capital! Harry thought so, and lost no 'time in carrying it out1  They went forth from the saloon to- gether, Harry in barbarian garb, leaning on the arm of the well-dressed man, who as they hurried along Broadway and down the street which led to the steam-, er, kept up a continual flow of talk asiout Margare, telling a topusand anecdte  about her which quite' won  y heart.      q   w   at Arrived at the pier where, in thhe -gloomy night and under the leaden sky, the steamer lay, Mr. Burke procured a carriage, had Harry' luggage brought i ashore, one huge trunk lashed on behind  one fixed on the box, anda plethoric car- pet bag put on the front seat inside; af-,  ter which, the driver being perched on 1 his seat, over the topmost trunk, Harry  and Stanley Burke entered, and the car- riage rolled away.  As they sat aide by side on the back I eat, Stanley Burke, his face lighted up  by an occasional lamp gleam, talked pleasantly and in his easy way about  Margaret, and Harry, his heart beating quickly under his coarse coat, hung on  his every word.           c "Decidedly, Stanley Burke is a good 1 fellow!" thought Harry "and if he  wants helping along, I'm his man p Here the carriage stopped in a darl part of a street which, near the head of I Broadway, branched off toward the East i River, in front of a four-storied dwelling,    which stood silent and dark .n the shadow, its windows closed from side- rwalk to roof.  I  "A grand kind of building i" muttered - arry as they descended from the car- [ riage.  . , "The home of Margaret," replied r Stanley Burke. "The lower floor is a y ou see, occupied as a store; Margaret and her mother have the rest of it to themselves. My room is in the back part of it, on the third floor." And opening the side door with a night-key, Stanley Burke directed the driver to unlash the trunks, and bring them into the dark entry, which being done, Burke left Harry and the driver alone in the dark entry, while he went up stairs to bet a light. He presently returned, holding- the light above his head, as he came down the stairway, his usual bland smile play- "g over his face. And he held the light while the driver, (apock-marked Hiber- nian who blew hard, and swore much In a low voice,) assisted by Harry, car- ried. the trunks, one at a time, up three paii efstairs, into the back room. Trunks a nd carpet-bag being safely deposited there, and the driver paid and dismissed, Harry and Burke sat down in the room, and looked on each other's faces by the -light of the candle. It was a very comfortable place. A moderate fire simmered in an air-tight wood stove. The sofa on which they sat was covered with red velvet. An elegant French bedstead stood in one corner, near a mahogany article of furni ture, which did not-look precisely like a ' book-case, nor yet like a bureau, but seemed a combination of both. The walls, covered with subdued colored pa-  per, were ornamented with a few choice pictures, in slight gilt frames-pictures very warm, Gallic and oriental. It was altogether an elegant yet oozy apartment. Resting one arm on the arm of the sofa1 and seated in an attitude which did justice to his fihe apparel and muscu- lar frame, Stanley Burke quietly watch- ed his rough friend, who was gazing about him with expanded eyes. "A quiet little place, which Aunt Dunbar is kind enough to let me have, in one corner of her house. Don't you think'so?" said Mr. Burke.   "Snug as a bug in a rug," was the un- classical response of Harry. "Here you can remain quietly with mo, and to-morrow morning you will see Margaret. Ah! I had quite forgotten!" continued Mr. Stanley Burke, as he rose and assumed his cloak, hat and gloves. "I have an engagement which will only keep me for an hour. You must excuse me for that time, my dear Morgan. When I come back, we'll have a nice lit- tle supper from the restaurant in Broad- way. Until then, amuse yourself with books and papers on the table." ". don't mind me," replied Harry; "( I can put in the time quite comfortably. Have you got such a thing as a good Havana cigar?" Burke showed his. white 4eeth in a pleasant smile as he presented his cigar case. "A present from a particular friend in Havana." And as Harry lighted the fragrant cigar, and stretched himself, red shirt, coarse coat and all, on the velvet sofa Mr. Stanley Burke regarded him with a quiet smile, and then, with the words,- "Back in an hour, Morgan," left the room. There was no light to shine upon him, 1 or to show the peculiar expression of his  face, as he went down the dark staircase. t "In the house where Margaret lives!" ejaculated Harry, as he watched the  white smoke-wreaths floating to the a ceiling. "Pretty good luck, this, after a all your adventures, Harry!"    8 And Harry fell into a pleasant reverie, c in which he saw the form of Margaret g clad in mourning, her face not so bloom- t ing as of old, but still beautiful in its pal- lor, framed in a black bonnet, appear al- p most visibly amid the smoke-wreaths n which went up from his cigar. "How  si glad she'll be to see me!"And his C heart, at the thought, beat all the quicker under his coarse coat.  . All at once a new idea seemed to m strike him. "Why not go out, and buy some de- m cent clothes? I can be back before si Burke returns. I should like to shake tt hands with a decent coat and clean shirt, t. once more." Burke had left his night- key, ox a duplicate, on the table. Harrv bl secured this key, put on his slouched hat, ar and went quietly down the dark stair- st way and from the house. In less than 7   n- a quarter of an hour he foiund himself in Canal-street, in front of 'one of thoseF ;h stores which, in flaming signs and picto- -e rial handbills, offer to furnish "Cheap "Shirts" to a benighted world.  The "e ( Only original shirt store, on the cheap s. system, in the world!" was'the startling y announcement which appeared' in the e window, in big letters, revealed by the  dazzling gas-light. After a careful sur- ;- vey of the contents of the window. Har- - ry resolved to enter and make a pur- h chase; and enter he did. Better, much better for Harry, had he looked at the I letter which Burke had held before his eyes; but a thousand times better for i him had he never put a foot in the Ca- nal-street shirt store. r CHAPTER XXVI I-ARRY entered the store,. and as he crossed the threshold-beforet he had , time to scan the sharp features of the , proprietor, who stood quietly' leaning over the glass case on the counter- there passed by him a young woman, poorly dressed, her face hidden by a thick green veil. Her faded garments brushed him, as he entered; and, ere he couldlook around, she hadpassed through the door and disappeared. What was it about the young woman which, even as her garments brushed against him, filled him with a sudden and inexplicable interest? The gas-light shone fully upon her, but did not dis- close her features-did Harry obtain a glimpse of her countenance through the thickly covered veil? "Shirts, sir?" smirked the bland pro- prietor, who was a little man, with sharp nose and gold spectacles. "Shirts of all sizes, patterns and prices-returned from California, I presume, sir?" "Who was that young lady?" asked Harry, keeping one eye upon the shirt man, and the other upon the door. "Don't know her name-works for me-just paid her off-pay well here, sir, four shillings for two shirts-here they are-best quality-take a look at them!" Harry did not reply to the gentleman, but, turning on his heel, left the store, and anxiously gazed up and down Canal- street. He caught a glimpse of the summer el  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7091-00000052"/> bonnet which the young woman wore, bout a hundred yards away, in the di- rection of the North River. At once he hurried after her, determined to track her footsteps and follow her to her home. Now, as Harry was a sound, honest man, he could have had no improper in- tentions in this pursuit, but was evi- dently prompted by an indefinable impulse, or a wild delusion. Why need we describe in detail the wild chase which- she led him? She entered one of the red cars which run on West Broadway, Hudson-street, and the Eighth avenue; Harry followed her, but could not get a seat near her. She sat in an opposite corner, out of the light and in the shadow, her veil still closely drawn over her face. The car went on its way; the conductor, a slim person, filled with a due serrse of the awful responsibility of his situation, bristled along collecting fares, letting fat gentlemen out, and nervous ladies in;: and now and then shaking up a drunken man, who fell asleep and snored like a trombone. The car went on its way up Hudson-street, and into the remote re- gions of the Eighth avenue, where the night is made musical by the combined bark of a thousand dogs; and still Harry, very nervous and impatient, could not obtain a sight of the unknown woman's face. At last the passengers were reduced to two, Harry and the young woman, who sat with closed veil and folded hands, opposite him. "t I wonder if she never intends to get wut, or if she is going on to the North Pole?" grumbled Harry to himself. when the woman inthe straw bonnet rose, rang the bell, and, in a moment, hurried from the car. Harry at once followed her, and found himself in that peculiar region which is not above Seventieth-street, nor below Thirtieth; where it is, precisely, isn't any one's business. It is a region extending from the ave- nue to the Hudson River, and,over its broken surface old-fashioned country seats vainly endeavor to maintain their position against flimsy modern struc- tures, of all sizes, from a hencoop to a barn, and built not so much with a view to comfort or architectural beauty as for the purpose of extracting the greatest   amount of rent from the neediest sort of tenants. By day this region rings with the ceaseless thunder of blasted rocks; by night, it alarms the distant Jersey shore with the rich, deep notes of an army of dogs, whose numbers cannot possibly be told. Gazing over its varied surface, from the height of the reservoir, you are struck with the singular panorama which it presents. Bogus palaces, truck gardens, fine old country seats, perched upon the rocks, wide streets that are by turns miracles of dust and mud: it looks. like the sketch of a city done very hasti- ly by an artist who is anxious to do his work in the least possible time. It is from this region that, near the break of day, emerge those mysterious men who walk between the shafts of a two-wheeled cart, a harnessed dog on either hand, and a patient woman push- ing in the rear. Mysterious men, whose apparition startles belated downtowners (unfamiliar with the upper region) and gives rise to the query--"Where in the mischief do they live?" Descending from the car, Harry fol- lowed the unknown woman into a neigh- boring grocery, whose lighted windows looked quite cheerful in the Auxnounding darkness. The grocery was one of those kept by taciturn persons of Teutonic descent, who speak strong German, and very im- perfect English, never count the half cent on the shilling in making change, and sell everything-everything from a glass of dubious ardent spirits to a sixpence worth of coal or firewood. Into such a store, Harry followed the unknown. The proprietor, a gloomy German, with unshaven beard, stood behind the counter, his sad vissage giving a melan- choly hue to various articles, vegetable and fleshy, which encircled him. Without raising her veil, the young woman opened her hand, laid a solitary -half dollar on the counter, and in a low ' voice inaudible to Harry, who stood watching near the door, made her pur- chases. O fashionable dames! who, softly clad in satin and in velvet, wrapped luxuri- ously in finest linen, languidly descend- ing from your carriages to."shop" at Stuart's, how you would have stared had you seen the poor seamstress do   her "shopping" in the Teutonic gro- oeryl I A pound of coffee, a' pound of sugar, an armful of firewood, a loaf of bread, these were her purchases. O softly clad and fashionable dames! and yet per- chance that poor girl who gathered in her arms those sticks of firewood, had blood as precious in her veins as that which gives its glow to your own lovely face! Her purchases made, she-firewood, coffee and sugar in her arms-left the store without glancing at Harry. But Harry, who felt an unusual emotion- about his heart as she passed him, fol- lowed her from the store, and then along a dark street which led to the Hudson River, displaying on either, hand, under the dull,' heavy night, a large proportion of' building lots to a very small rnuber of houses. Along this dteMy street, where the uttd was rich and thick, and of the first quality, Harry Morgan followed the young woman, who once or twice stop- ped and looked back, as though conscious that she was followed. Harry, howeve, kept in the shadow, and cautiously'lin- gered in her footsteps. At'length she turned from the street into an open field, from whose distant extremity a feeble raystruggled from the, Window of 'a miserble tenement. Along a footpath, soft with mud, and wind- ing adtong piles of timber and broken rocks, the young woman hurried rapidly, until she came tho the nasrto door of the solitary house which stood alone in, a bleak space-where she lingered for a moment' t look back, and then 'disap' peared. Harry advarned from the shadow to the window; and, shruded by the dark night, looked through an aperture of the windoW-curtains. He saw the young woman standing in a wretched apart- ment, light in hand, her darkly attired form thrown 'strongly into view by the bare white walls and uncarpeted floor. A small sheet-iron stove, a table of un- painted wood, and two chairs, consti- tuted the furniture of the place. She stood there, still veiled, light in hand, and Harry could mark the pulsations of her bosom by the movement of her aded shawl. After a moment she opened a door,   and disappeared into a second room, and all was dark. Certainly Harry's heart thumped and thumped again, as leaning against the window-sill he waited for her reappear- ance. After a pause she came again, and, light in hand, knelt before the stove, and proceeded to make a fire. In doing this, she lifted her veil and laid her bon- net on a chair. The candle on the floor shone upward into her face. "O my God!" was the ejaculation which came from Harry's heart as he leaned against the window-sill, trembling in every limb as that face wis revealed to him. CHAPTER XXXVII. O anr God!" cried Harry, who at the sight of that face grew suddenly weak as a chidM; "it's Margaret!"The woman -who knelt before the stove, her face re- vealed by the upcast light of the cindle; 'had seen twenty years of life. Her: brow hair relieved a pale' countenance, lighted by large hazel eyes. There was great- loveliness and much suFiering conjoined in every line of that countenance--deep sufiering that does not relieve itself in. tears or wild ejaculations, butt seats itself at the heart, and slowly gnas-'the life away. Poor Margaret! when we saw you last, you were so blooming on lip and cheek; there was such joyousness in your eyes -not a pulse of your young bosom but swelled with the inspiration' of hope and love-and now, so sorfow- stricken and heart-broken, with the fever of an irreparable calamity burning in your large beautiful eyes! It's a world of change, Margaret-of sad, ter- rible change-of friendships that betray with a kiss-of loves that are bought and sold, like merchandize in the market, place'-of hopes that are nourished through long years, and that ripen to fulfilment only to be gathered by the hand of death-physical death, killing the body, or that unutterable moral death which ossifies the soul; a world, Margaret, which no one in the dawn of manhood or womanhood, seeing, as with prophetic sight, all the way of the future, plain as day, would have the courage to live in for a single hour.  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7091-00000053"/> Andcif, since :lst we saw you, Margaret you have sinnied if the pure blossom of your virgin soul has theen trampled into the mire oftenmptation and crime, why. God be merciifl to you. and may you rather be dealt with by His justice than by the ten( -rest mercy of man! On the window-sill Harry leaned. stricken into child-like . weak;ness )b that sight. "And so Burke lied to me.," he mut- tered. ' But he spoke so smooth and fair. I could'nt help believe him! This is livin' on your means, is it? A half a dollar, a pound o' sugar and coffee an' a home like this.! Such means and such livin'!" Again Harry laid his face against the window-pane, with a faint hope that it might not be his iMaagaret whom he saw thus reduced to the lowest stage of destitution-but no! His eyes did not deceive him. That pale woman, kneeling on the naked floor, was his Margaret- his wife! "But I'll make it all right yet; for every day of want that you have suffered, you shall have a thousand of peace and comfort, and--" Harry went from the window, put his hand upon the door, and entered the miserable room. pausing a short space from the threshold. so that the candle- light lit up his sunburnt face. Margaret raised her eyes with a nerv- ous movement of surprise, and then her eyes expanded, her face grew paler, and with a wild scream she stretched forth her arms. God help me! It is his ghost!" And fell forward upon her face like a dead woman. Henry knelt on the floor beside her, and took her to his bosom tenderly with his toil-hardened hands, pushing her un- I loosened hair aside from her face, and ( more than once pressing his lips to her 1 cold forehead and colder lips. All the E while the light which shone upward upon I his face showed every feature working, E spasm-like, as though the man could not a speak, to tell in words the emotions which swelled his chest.       I "I am back again, and rich-rich. do a you hear me, Margaret?" he said, again t and again, holding her in his arms, and t gazing upon her face with all the ten- s derness of a rude-loooking but kind- i hearted nurse soothing a sick child. D   "Rich! rich! Not so rich as Astor, f' but rich enough for both of us!" Alas! brave Harry! there are somo  evils which gold, holy and beautiful as "t is-gold, so devoutly worshipped every i wheere, cannot cure! It was a long time before her cheek  glowed with the color of life again; and a long time even after she unclosed her eyes, and saw his face and heard his - voice, that she could realize that it was her husband who held her in his arms. "God help me! Harry, it is you, in- deed!" was her first exclamation, as she surveyed that honest face. which was changed, in some respect, but still glowed with old love for her. "I've thought you as dead so long-seen you dead ;awake and in my dreams so long, that-" tears came to her relief and she bent her head and wept upon his breast; wept, as though every fibre of her heart was breaking, and put her arms convulsively about his neck, as if she were drowning in some dark river, and in his arms was her only hope of life. At length she rose, and glancing rapidly (with a singular look, which did not escape Harry,) first at the door which led out in the dark night, and then at the door, which opened into the second room, she sat down and motioned Harry to take a seat beside her. Her eyes were downcast, and she 'picked at the ends of her shawl in an absent way. "Why do I find you here, Margaret, said Harry, " in such poverty?-" The name of Stanley Burke, and the story which Stanley had told him, rose to his lips; but he thought he would not men- tion either, until Margaret spoke of her cousin. "And mother, how is she?" "Hush! She is very sick there," and Margaret pointed nervously to the door of the next room. "She is sleeping for the first time in a long while. Do not speak loud, Harry,"-how odd the old name sounded from her lips!-" do not speak loud!"And a shudder like an ague-chill pervaded her frame. 'But why, Margaret, darling  Oh! how often I've thought of you in the rain and heat and cold, in the mines and on the sea, and when they left me, as they thought, dyin' at the foot of the tree, I saw your face and heard your voice, even in my fever. Oh! Margaret! you can never know how dear to me you've been!   Why do I find you and mother in such a miser able place as this?" She looked up into his face, long and eagerly, as though the sight of it was life to her. "It is a long story, Harry, and to-night is not the time to tell it; and to-morrow I will tell you all!'" "But you must leave this place to- night; you shall not sleep another night under such a miserable roof." "You forget that mother. is very sick and cannot be moved; to-morrow, Har- ry, will be time enough." And they talked together of the past and future, Harry gazing earnestly upon his wife, and she now looking up in his face, and now casting that nervous glance from one door to the other. How his heart rolled forth in his pic- tures of the future! And how often after a yearning gaze in his face, she would turn her face away from the fight as if to hide its sudden pallor, and the quick, involuntary quivering of the lips.  "Leave me, Harry, to-night;'" she said  at last, "mother is very ill, and I am  worn with work and watching. To- morrow I will tell you how we came to  live in this miserable place. Yes," she E said with a singular brightening of her f gaze-- to-morrow we will talk of our a future life!" And she rose from her chair, and Harry X rose, but it was not until he had taken 1 her once more to his bosom, pillowed t her head upon his shoulder, and pressed f, upon her lips a kiss-we will not assert g decisively that there was only one kiss n -which seemed to bear with it a whole c] lifetime of hope and love, condensed into i a single moment, that Harry could be tl induced to think of leaving her.   n At last he stood ready to depart. " To- fc morrow! early to-morrow!" he said. b "To-morrow!" echoed Margaret; and, after another kiss, she watched the form h( of Harry as he moved to the door-oh! at the strange, mad intensity of her gaze pi At the door, Harry paused and looked w back. Margaret stood like a statue in of the centre of the room, and while her a   face had grown paler, her eyes were all th the brighter. "Harry!" the name came from   her of lips in a thick and broken voice, and she pit bounded to his arms and hung there, na robbing and trembling on his breast. A, now," she said, "  and to-morrow-   a to-morrow!"  The words died on her lips, and she wrung Harry's hands within Id her own as she followed him over the ife threshold. Id  ' Goad-night! to-morrow, darling!" id She heard his voice. even after the shad- ows of the night had taken his form from o- her sight. And she stood in the door- it way a long time, looking after him, as though her gaze could pierce the dark- k, ness round her. r-  As for Harry, he went on his wayr muttering, And now, Mr. Stanley it Burke, I guess you and I will have a talk n together. These trunks aint safe in your s clutches. By Jove! why did not I think e of mentionin' the matter to Margaret?'P And with the thought of Stanley Burke's - falsehood, and the consciousness that  Margaret was still the Margaret of other days, occupying his mind by turns, he , went on his way. But the words which he uttered, as he thought, to the air , alone, were overheard by a listener whose I form wa, hid by the shadows around the path. Turning from    the door, Margaret' , closed it, and approached the light. A sudden change had come over her. Her face, pale enough before, was now livid and ashy. She trembled in every limb. As she took up the candle and went to- wards the next room, you could see the light shake and quiver, as if in sympa- thy with the terror which pervaded her frame. She entered that room, and gazed around it with a look that was nervous, wild, almost mad-a small chamber, miserably furnished, with a bed in one corner. There was no one there; the face of the mother did not meet the rays of the candle. No mother there . for, alas! the mother of Margaret had been in her grave two years. Margaret advanced to the bed, and, held the light over the patched coverlet, and drew that coverlet gently from the. pillow. Upon that pillow rested a babe,. who, perchance, had seen three months. of life; and its rosy face was touched by a smile as it slept all calmly and gently there. "O my God!" burst from  the heart of Margaret, as she fell weeping on the pillow beside the child--her child!" 0 my God I why did I not tell him all?"  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7091-00000054"/> CHAPTER XXXVIII. "ET US leave Margaret for a little while, and return to Stanley Burke. When that gentleman left Harry in his room, and went down the dark stairway, there was no light to reveal the peculiar expression of his face; but, as he passed along Broadway, walking rapidly through its crowd, his velvet-lined cloak dangling from one shoulder, and brought under his left arm, the gas-light shone fully upon him, and in spite of the shadow of his down-drawn hat, lit up his visage, and showed the peculiar look in palpa- ble hideousness. The tightly compressed lips, the small eyes glittering beneath the knit brows, the expanded nostrils, and broad, low forehead, covered with sudden wrinkles, all revealed the singular agitation which now moved the man. And now and then the gentleman would smile-such a smile! It lit up his high cheek-bones into a flush, gave a fiercer twinkle to his small eyes, and showed his white teeth in ghasther whiteness-(Burke, like Dickens' Car- ker, had white teeth, but he was totally a different man from Carker, and we didn't steal the teeth from Dickens)- and even suffused his broad low fore- head with its sinister glow. What was the man thinking about? Why had he inveigled Harry Morgan to his room? Why filled the honest mechanic with the falsehood that Margaret and her mother lived in the house of which his room was a part? Had he designs upoit Harry, and if he had designs upon Harry and his well- filled trunks, how did he intend to car- ry them out? Grave questions and full of meaning; but, as we cannot look into the heart of Stanley Burke, and note clearly the emotions that grapple there, it is not possible to answer them. The truth is, Stanley, having seen Harry and his trunks safely lodged in his room, had come forth to take the fresh air, and to think. It might have frightened you to have meen his thoughts, could they have taken palpable shape. And while he goes up Broadway, unconscious of the crowd thfough which he passes, now scowling and now smiling, now twirling his gold-   en chain, and now drawing his cloak closer round him, let us take a glimpse at the real character of Stanley Burke. He was a character. It is a great mistake to suppose that there are no savages but those who go naked and paint their faces, and eat their slain. Broad- cloth drapes many a savage, fiercer and more completely infernal than any that ever sat down to a cannibal feast in the wilds of Van Dieman's Land. The externals of a gentleman, fine ap- parel, the graces of education, may mask the real nature of such a. savage, but still, at heart, he is more remorseless- more completely defiant of all the ties which bind man to man and humanity to God than his tatooed brother of the war-club and jungle. Stanley Burke was a man of the world in the intensest form. To live well, to gratify all his appe- tites, without one effort of honest work, of hand or brain, and without coming within the reach of the iron hand of the law, was the religion of his life. For years he had made money, and much of it, in various ways, and always kept up a good appearance, and yet: somehow, he was always in want of money. To say that he was a gambler would but poorly describe him. All men of the world are gamblers, in some sense or other-at faro, in stocks, in trade, in their own reputation, or in the reputation of other people-but the mere gambler at cards is the smallest of his tribe; he only injures and affects a very silly and limited class. The man is dangerous who, to the character of a gambler-a lottery broker of chance and huckster of destiny-adds other qualities, which mask and orna- ment his real nature. Stanley Burke was such a man. For years he had lived well, appeared in elegant plumage, kept the company of that genteel class who, polluted with the moral assassination of womanhood, are yet received with the best society-but where the means came from, was a secret known only to a few. Stanley had gambled at faro and at bank-stock. He had lived by turns in all the large cities of the Union. Now, he was (or seemed to be) a cotton bro- ker in New-Orleans; now, a fancy stock man in Wall-street; now, a planter in   Charleston; now, a commission merchant in Cincinnati; now, a gentleman of lei- sure in Washington; but he always made money, and was always in want of money. He had seen every phase of the savage life, which is but poorly hidden by the glittering tinsel-cloak of large city civili- zation, and that life had taken possession of him, and moulded him in every fibre. It was this man who now walked Broadway-thinking-and Henry Mor- gan and his well-filled trunks were the matters which occupied his thoughts. Thus occupied he reached Union-square, and, pausing for a moment, looked up to the leaden sky. "It may be a good plan"-he mut- tered, as if speaking of some secret pur- pose-" and it may not! Anyhow, the opportunity is golden, and I must not let it slip. And I must decide upon it anyhow, before I return to my room and *onfront Morgan." And he smiled, and his small dark eyes emitted a light that was not pleas- ant to look upon, as he-.for the moment forgetting his usual composed demeanor -raised his clenched hand to the dark- ened sky. "To my room-the plan is good; or, if it won't do, I must and can find a bet- ter-to my room, and confront Morgan." He little deemed that Morgan was no longer in his room, but far away in a far different apartment. Return we to the miserable home of Margaret, where she bends over her babe, her tears moistening the pillow on which it rests. "My God!" was the exclamation, often repeated-wrung from a heart torn by its agony-"My God! Why did I not tell him all?" And, rising, she held the candle over the face of the babe, and looked at it, with a look most strange to see upon a woman's face-remorseless hate and yearning love were in her straining eyes. A part of her being-the blossom of her life-it slumbered there, and yet it was the external symbol of a fact, which, but to think upon, made her existence a hell. Sad mother! Innocent child! There is a blot upon your life, mother, which cannot be washed away-a future before you, child, that has no ray of hope upon its darkened brow.   Margaret went into the next room, placed the candle on the table, and sat down in the chair, where Harry had lately sat, and folding her hands on her knees-her foot moving nervously all the while-gazed at the blank wall with great glaring eyes. But she did not see the wall-the word " to-morrow!" seem- ed painted on the air, even as it was stamped upon her brain-" to-morrow!" She saw, or seemed to see this word quivering there in letters of ire; and it held her gaze, or if she turned her eyes away, it was still before her. "To-morrow!  How shall I meet him! How shall I tell him all! How tell him that the woman he loves-his wife-who promised to be true to him while living and to his memory when dead-who, to-night, saw him start up as if from the grave, and hang upon his breast as in other days-that she is--" Her lips could not speak the word, but she put both hands over her eyes at the very thought. And the light of the candle fell upon the bare department, and upon the wo- man, who sat trembling there, the very embodiment of hopeless misery. All at once the door opens, and a form appears on the threshold. It is Harry come back! Margaret starts-up at the thought; but, when she sees the face of the intruder sits down again, and crouches against the wall, as though he were some savage animal. "Well, wife! you see I've come!" It was Mr. Stanley Burke who spoke. "Wife!" she echoed, and crouched closer to the wall. "Yesterday I found you out, and told you I'd come to see you to-night," continued the gentleman, dropping into a chair. "D-n the place, how cold it is!" and he drew his velvet-lined cloak closer around his shoulders. "You don't seem glad to see me? Here's a sweet, dear huzzy of a wife, who runs away from a husband, hides herself from him for six months or more, and when he finds her out and comes to see her, meets him with the look of an enraged cat that would like to bite, but-is afraid!" Margaret made no reply, but crouching closer to the wall, looked at him over her shoulder; her eyes alone seemed living in her face. Don't be surprised at Stanley's rough  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7091-00000055"/> language. The man who can bow the lowest on Broadway, and show his teeth in the blandest manner, is very often, the same man who, within four walls, insults, taunts-sometimes beats-a de- fenceless woman. Do not believe all that you see in Broadway, or at the opera, or at a pleas- ant social party; behind all these, there is a dark background of homes whose secrets would appall you, whose miseries would strike you dpmb. There we were, the very models of perfection," continued Stanley, shutting one eye, as he gazed upon her with an insolent leer, " man and wife in our two rooms; how we loved each other! As if our happiness was not complete, a pledge of our love, (that, I believe. is the true novel style,) was about to appear, when you must run away and hide, and plunge yourself up to the neck in misery  and shirt-making. How is shirt-making,  pet?"                I No reply from Margaret. Crouching i even closer to the wall, her face turned  over her shoulder, she looked at him  with that corpse-like face and those great e glaring eyes.            e "If you don't like me, why did you v marry me?" he said, as insolently as you j can imagine a smoothly-dressed brutal s man to speak. Without changing her position, Margaret replied. She did not d start, and call down thunders, and burst s into those torrents of epithets and adjec- t tives with which some lady-novelists A make lurid their pages; for she was not the kind of woman you find in some ak specimens of lady-literature, but a real h woman! much tried, deeply suffering- may be, somewhat fallen-but still a a woman and not a tornado in petticoats. ei Margaret replied in a low voice, so low fa that it scarcely rose above a whisper. le "I was upon a sick bed. Mother was y( dead, and the expenses of her funeral ex- or hausted al my store of money. I was w sick, and friendless, and penniless." to "Did the thought of that dead lover fr of yours make you sick?" brutally inter- du rupted Stanley.           su But, without changing her position, or ev noticing his remark, Margaret went on. "You appeared. You were kind to me. liv You know I wouldn't say it, if it wasn't a I true, but you were kind to -me. You un supplied me with money, poisured a Yc   he nurse to watch over me while I was th wild with fever. I thought you did all n this because we were cousins; I did'nt Is, know when a man like you treats a wo- e- man kindly he always does it with a purpose; he is kind, that he may pollute, in betray, and-sell! I-  "Well! why did you marry me?" re again interrupted Stanley, with a wicked ;e light in his eye. Is  "I recovered, and was grateful. Need I tell you how the thousand attentions f with which you surrounded me deceived g me as to your real character." n  "' Yes, I remember," and Stanley laifgh- oed. "I used to sit by you praising your s dead lover, the defunct carpenter. It's a a sure way to touch a woman's heart." She went on. "Alone in the world- friendless-all that I loved in the grave i -in an evil hour, telling you that I could not give you love, simply esteem, I consented to become your wife. I might find a thousand excuses for this- might say that long-indulged grief and [ sickness had weakened my will and dimmed my perception-but I make no excuse. I married you. There is no excuse for me. And I bear the suffering which that marriage has cost me as my just due. The truth is, that I cannot suffer too much for it." Her eyes dropped; a single tear rolled down her colorless cheek. And she shuddered as she had shuddered every time Burke alluded to her lover, Harry Morgan. ("Why did you run away from me?' asked Stanley, the same devil's look in his eye. She looked at him as though he were a reptile which she did not know wheth- er to despise most or fear, and her pale face grew scarlet. "Don't ask me, Stan- ley. You know why I left you. And you know that rather than be near you, or have you in my sight for an hour, I would-I would-"  She had no word to express the loathing which flashed from her eyes.  Stanley, whose face during this strange interview was unu- sually flushed-whose eye shone with even an unusual wickedness-replied: "Well, pet! like me or not, you must live with me. The law you know gives a husband a very decided power over an unruly wife. You must live with me. You cannot hide yourself where I wont   find you. And to-morrow I'll come to bring you from this wretched place to a very comfortable home. You'll think better of it; darling." And he rose, drawing the velvet-lined cloak closer about him, and advanced a step toward her. There was a certain wildness in his manner which she had never seen be- fore. O how she longed to say a word which would humble all his schemes into dust! "Harry lives! I am not your wife, even if I never can be wife to him! You have no power over me in law!" The words were on her lips, but she did not utter them. "How's the baby, Maggy, dear ' and he advanced a step nearer. "Think of it! It was only yesterday that I first beheld the face of my only child! And " -rapidly advancing, he seized her in his arms, and put his kiss upon her lips, ere she had the most remote idea of his in- tentions. Struggling in his embrace, as though his very touch was pestilence, she tried to avoid his kisses, by burying her head upon his hated bosom, but his strong arm held her in a clutch that was like that of death to the pale, quiveringr woman. "Here's an  affectionate wife" he laughed, and released her. She sank into the chair, pale and panting for breath, her hair doosened in the strug- gle) streaming over her shoulders. Then with a laugh, and a look of taunting insolence, he said,--"To-mor- row, pet! you remember! To-morrow!" and showing his white teeth he moved to the door. "To-morrow I will come and bring you. Good-night, pet!" he laugh- ed again, opened the door, and was gone. She breathed freer, like one suddenly taken from a plague-infected room into open air. "To-morrow!" she echoed; "little does he know of to-morrow!" As she spoke, her eye was attracted by something on the floor. It glittered in the light. She took it up-it was a gold chain-and had fallen from the neck of Stanley in the late struggle. It was not the gold chain he usually wore, but a gold chain curiously formed of pure ore; the chain which she had seen glittering not an hour before around the neck of Harry Morgan. There was something in the sight of   it which seemed to paralyze Margaret in Levery limb, and deprive her for the mo- ment of the power of speech. Her eyes were riveted to the chain, and she re- membered that, even as Stanley held her in his arms, there was a livid bruise upon his right hand. CHAPTER XXXIX. Wr  left Margaret, gazing in dumb horror upon the gold chain, which was curiously fashioned of links of pure ore. It was late on the next afternoon that Stanley Burke, picking his way amid the rocks and timbbrs which obstructed the winding path, again stood before the door of her miserable home. As Stanley came along, with an even stride, and cloak drawn gracefully over his shoulder, you'might see that he was dressed with his usual nicety; his hat was of the glossiest, his shirt-collar of the whitest, and he stepped carefully along the miry path, to avoid soiling his well-polished boots with mud. A well- dressed gentleman taking a walk in the rural districts to collect his rents, or to take a mouthful of fresh air, was (or seemed to be) Mr. Stanley Burke. He smiled often. revealing his ivory teeth, and yet his face was a little hag- gard, his eves feverish in their restless twinkle, as though he had not slept well on the previous night. At the door of Margaret's miserable home he paused and looked around. A November sun, shining over a bank of dreary, leaden clouds, that were piled up in the west, over the Hudson heights -crowned with farm-house or country seat, appearing among leafless trees- gave its light to a cheerless, wintry scene, in the midst of which the Hudson rolled and glittered with a broad belt of sunshine on its waves. Stanley's eye was not much taken by the grand, sullen beauty of the scene ; it simply traversed the space between him and the river-an open space, broken with rocks, bounded on the north by a deserted country-seat, and on the south by a cluster of leafless trees, which rose bare and bleak against the river and the sky. Stanley's glance was quick, search- ing and nervous, as his eye traversed this space, but no spoken word betrayed the real nature of his thoughts.  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7091-00000056"/> "Well, and now for my pet!" Ie pushed open the door, and entered the bleak room, over whose naked floor the declining sunshine redly fell. An oath burst from his lips. The room, at all times bare enough, was now without stove, table, chair or furniture of any kind. Stanley hurried into the next room, and pushed open the closed shutters. The bed had disappeared; it was completely stripped of the miserable furniture which it had held yesterday. "Escaped, by -- !" cried Stanley Burke; and then followed a torrent of curses; and then Stanley stood silent in the centre of the room, buried in thought. Where had Margaret gone? Could Harry Morgan have taken her from this miserable place? It was after a long pause that Stanley walked cautiously up and down the de- sertedrooms, carefully peering into every nook and corner. "It is not. here," he said at length. A I must have dropped it in some other place." And presently went slowly from the house. You may watch him as he goes; and, as his shadow is thrown long and black over the rocks, you may notice that his head is turned over his shoulder toward the river, until he is out of sight. The next-three were busy weeks with Mr. Burke. He searched for Margaret in every nook and corner of New-York, and of the adjacent cities, but in vain. 'By a fortunate speculation, he came into possession of a considerable sum of money; paid off some debts; removed from his single apartment to an elegant- ly. furnished mansion farther up town; appeared often in Wallistreet, seeming' like-a man possessed in every fibre with the insatiate devil of stock speculation;. and once or twice gave " splendid" even- ing parties to a select number of friends at his new residence. Could he have discovered Margaret's retreat, he could have been quite at ease. And as to Harry Morgan. Where was Harry Morgan? Stanley nevermet him in his walks. But New-York is a large. city, and you can easily lose sight of a man there. Of course, while the three weeks pass- ed away, many things took place, such as   murders, suicides, robberies, coroner's- inquests, of which Stanley, engaged in business or pleasure, could take no cog- nizance. He had scarcely time to read the pa. pers. There was an item which caught his eye as he sat one evening in a cushioned chair of the very saloon in which he had first met Harry Morgan; an item which appeared in the closely printed columns of a western paper. And while the bar- ber (one of those gentlemen who speak imperfect English  and  wear  white aprons) was oiling his hair and whiskert Stanley read: "Among the victims of this explosion (the pars. graph treated of a steamboat explosion on the Ohic Biver) was one whose case excites universal sym. pathy. A young woman dressed in deep mourning, and bearing her babe in her arms, was driven by the flames into the river, and notwithstanding the ef. forts of a gallant Kentuckian to save' her, was drowned. Her b dy floated ashore, with the dead babe still clutched in the dead mother's arms. From some letters which were found about her per. son, it appears that her name was Margaret Burke, or Margaret Dunbar; and that, at the time of the accident, she was on her way from New-York to St. Louis." Stanley was a man of iron nerves, but the paper dropped from his hand. He rose hastily from the chair, and went into a part of the saloon where the gas- light did not shine so brightly; As he stood arranging his cravat before a mir- ror, he was startled by th sudden psal lor of his face. "D-n her, she's gone, anyhow! But what was she doing west?   What put itinto her head to go to St. Louis V? Hastily assuming his hat and cloak, he left the saloon, and hurried homeward muttering oftentime -"Well I she isout of the way, anyhow p" A few days after this, Stanleygave a supper to a, few select friends, whom he assembled in a cozy back room of his new residence. Supper being over, and the cloth re- moved, the wine was brought in, and from his place at the head 'f the board Stanley gazed  over the faces of his guests, who numbered nine in all. There was a merchant and a lawyer, both staid in aspect three gentlemen of leisure, dressed in the last agony of fash- ion, who had known Stanley for years, and had been with him perchance in many a nice enterprise; two real-estate men, from whom he had lately purchas ed property and paid them  cmsh; and   three other persons, well dressed, and having a rich flavor of Wall-street in every word and action. You can see nine such men at any time in Broadway, and it is not worth while to describe them in detail. The room in which they were seated was a pleasant place, warmed by a bright coal fire; just the place for nine men, who feel comfort- able, to chat quietly and enjoy their champagne. "Well, gentlemen;" said Stanley, fill- ing his glass-a solitary servant stood near his shoulder-"As I am telling you, I contemplate a southern trip. My es- tates in Charleston, (into which, as I have told you, I have lately come by the death of my uncle,) need looking after. Possibly, I may go as far south as New- Orleans-,- -" "Well! here's success to you where- ever you go!" interrupted one of the gentlemen of leisure, and drained his glass, the rest of the company chorusing the sentiment. "And when I come back"'-.continued Stanley, holding a brimming glass of champagne before his eyes-"Aid when I come back -'--" His sentence was broken by theabrupt opening of the door. And. to the great astonishment. of the,company a lady en- tered--a lady very pale in faoe and clad in black, as if in mourning for a dead husband. The sight, which simply as- tonished the company, paralyed Stanley Burke. "By.--,-! my wife!" he ejaculated, and made a movement as if about to rise from his chair, but fell back again. And a silence like death prevailed as the lady advanced, and, resting her hand upon the back of a chair, stood like a ghost, in her dark apparel and pale face, in the centre of that festival scene, "I wish to speak with you-aloue, Mr. Burke!" said the lady in a low voice. And as she spoke, over the dark dress which she wore-upon her bosom, whose heavings were perceptible-a gold chain, curiously fashioned, of the pure ore, glit- tered in the light. Stanley's goae was riveted to that chain. But he made a desperate effort to recover his compo- Ure.  U My wife, Mrs. Burke, geitleien," he said, rising from his chair, and scarcely aware of the words which fell from his   lips. "My wife, Mrs. Burke, gentlemen -" and his face was white and scarlet by turns. The lady, without changing her posi- tion, said in a calm, even voice, "Mr. Burke. I wish to speak with you alone," and the gold chain, as she spoke, glitter- ed into light with every throb of her bosom. In a confused way, Stanley begged the gentlemen to excuse him for a few mo- ments; and then followed the lady from the supper room down stairs into the par- lor, where a solitary lamp was burning. It was not until he stood in that parlor, whose glaring furniture, rich carpet, mas- sive mirrors, luxurious sofas-all had a gloomy look in the dim light-that Stan- ley could recover even a portion of his usual presence of mind. Margaret, whom he had thought of as dead-dead with her dead babe still clutched in her arms-now stood before him, living, yet still looking, very much like a dead woman. Her black dres made her face seem even more unnatu- rally paie, and her eyes shone with a steady, clear, yet feverish light. It was Margaret, but. she was indeed sadly changed. She; did not take a seat, but confront- ed Stanley, who, for once in his life ter- ribly agitated, could not take his gpae from her face, "I thought you were dead!"-hesi- ated Stanley.  "The fact is, I saw it in thepapers- " "The papers told only a part of the truth," replid Margaret. "As you see, I. am not dead, but living. I have just arrived from the West. I wish to say a few words to you. The papers, as you know, tell a great many falsehoods, but sometimes tell hard truths, although in a mysterious shape. Now, can you tell me, what truth there is in this parad graph?" And she placed in Stanley's hands a newspaper which contained the para graph with which we commenced this sketch, and which we now quote again: "Yesterday evening, the body of an unknown man, entireh divested of clothing, was found float- ing in the North River, Pier No. . His hair was dark, and he appeared to be about thirty years of age. There was no mark upon him to indicate that he came to his dfath by violence, save, indeed, an abrasion of the skin on the right temple, evidently the result of contact with some object floatingn the river. The coroner investigated the nAtdeO  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7091-00000057"/> thoroughly; and the jury returned a verdict'that the body of the unknown had been thrown into the river by resurrectionists It was, after the inquest, properly interred in Potter's Field." Stanley took the paper, glanced over the paragraph-his hand shook a little- but all at once his gaze recovered its usual steadiness. "Well, Madam! what of this?" he said, quite calmly, handing back the pa- per with a gleam of the old wickedness in his look. "That paragraph may be true, or may not be true. I know noth- ing about it." Margaret with her eyes fixed on him replied, "But the dead man of whom the paragraph speaks-do you know any- thing about him? The 'abrasion of the skin on the right temple not the result of contact with some object floating in the river, but the result of a blow from a slung-shot or loaded cane wielded by an assassin's hand-do you know anything about that?" As she spoke Margaret advanced, and Stanley fell back a single step. Stanley  was pale, but the malignity of the mas-  ter fiend burned in his eyes. His hand e as clenched; he grated his teeth.  "And," said Margaret, as, with that pale face and lifted finger, she advanced I yet nearer to the enraged but shrinking t man--"And do you know anything about f the assassin himself-the assassin who 1s followed his victim, when that victim,  mistaking his way in the darkness, wan- o dered towards the river, followed him f even to the water's edge, and in the dark s crept close to him, and without warning E struck him one strong and fatal blow?- p the assassin who, when he found his vic- tim dead at his feet, rifled him of every- b thing that was valuable, made his clothes m into a bundle, to which he attached a D heavy stone, and then flung clothes and or corpse into the river?"       st Stanley retreated another step, but da did not reply; his clenched hands and eyes, lit with infernal light, looked as th though he was about to spring upon and m. throttle the woman before him.    ru "The assassin who, with the atmo- wi sphere of murder all about him, and the an livid mark which the murdered man, in fa one brief struggle for his life, had print- su ed on his hand, came to the home of his sig victim's wife, and dared to pollute her an with his kiss, and, as she struggled in to his grasp, dropped on the floor a golds St.   hat chain which he had rifled from the dead. at, This "-her eyes flashed, and she lifted the chain which hung upon her breast. er "This gold chain! Do you know any- - thing of'this, assassin? Or do you know ts anything of a poor laboring man who chanced to be wandering on the river he shore at the fatal hour; who came upon a- the murderer as he was engaged in rifling ss the dead; who, even in the dim light of be that autumn night, saw the body hurled h- into the river, himself all the while very near, but unperceived-and who silently n, traced the murderer to my home; and e then, through the city, to the murderer's r- own residence, where he charged him e with the crime, and was, by a large sum It of gold, induced to swear that, on the n morrow, he would leave New-York for n ever? Do you know anything of this y witness, sir?" The rage which had convulsed Stanley Burke for the last five minutes now i broke forth in words. A man of greater muscular power, he now advanced upon her with clenched hands, and his small 1 eyes flashing, and expanding in their sockets. t "You are not a woman, but a devil!" he said in a low voice. ("You have seen this man-this Hoffman-but I'll yet foil you-even if I have to -- "His look alone completed the sentence. There was murder in his eyes. He sprang up- on the brave pale woman, with all the ferocity of his brutal nature-but a strong arm intervened, and a form as muscular as his own, was suddenly inter- posed between him and Margaret. "Itook your money, but there was blood upon it, and as soon as a few little matters are settled, you can have it back. Don't strike that gal! You struck a man once, not long ago, behind his back-- strike me to the face, now, if you dare!" It was a rough but manly face, and the speaker was the "poor laboring man," of whom  Margaret had spoken rudely clad in work-day apparel, but with a muscular frame, hands hardened and knotted by labor, and a sunburnt face, overspread with wrinkles, the re- sult not of time. but of hard work. At sight of him, Stanley staggered back; and, in his surprise, suffered these words to escape him: "  I thought you were in St. Louis-in the West-anywhere but   in New-York! How came you back You swore to re --" But Margaret, leaning her hand on the arn of Hoffman, now spoke. "When I fled from my miserable home, I sought refuge with a poor woman in the neigh- borhood. Her husband had left that morn:ng for the West. And it was from this woman that I wrung the secret of i' the husband's departure, which he had told her the moment before he left, torn as he was by conflicting emotions. I need not tell you that she was the wife of this witness; nor relate how, with my child in my arms, and with means derived from the sale of a portion of this gold chain, I followed him-found him, and induced him to return. And now, I am here; my only purpose-she spoke with a changing countenance and violent effort-" to consign to justice the man who is at the same time the murderer of my husband and the father of my child." The strong excitement which had up- held Margaret for the last half hour now broke down all at once, and overcome by  the violence of her emotions-say her ( anguish-she dropped immediately to i the floor. Hoffman, the rude working man, caught a her up and bore her to the sofa, and in t that moment Stanley Burke hurried to I the door, opened it, and closed it, cross- ed the threshold, and locked the door d after him. Then seizing his hat and J cloak, which hung upon a rack in the d hall, he-with a face corrugated and  livid with despair-went with an uneven I step from the house, purchased with his v ill-got gold, into the cold, bleak wintry tS night. What emotions filled the breast;  what purposes thronged the brain of this  bad, desperate man, as he thus hurried d forth, no mortal man can ever certainly ft know. Had he given up the battle as lost, ir- revocably lost, or was there yet some ci new game to be played, some new crime h to be committed, in order to patch up o: the bloody record of the past? Or had b the brain of the strong, bad,.cunning man, been bewildered by the apparitions which had started up suddenly on his w path?                (i No pen can picture, no mortal can ever be know, the thoughts of this man as thus w he went forth alone into the night. t    Meanwhile, his guests up stairs much wondered at his long absence. "Strange!" cried one.   Odd!" an- other.  "Queer!" a third.   And then t they drank, and there was a long pause - followed by another chorus of ejacula- t tions. and another round of champaone. a  "Strange! odd! queer!" but still the f host did not return.  The guests waited i for him deep into the nioht. and sacri- ficed themselves in the effort to exhaust [ his champagne; and at last, very much e exhausted, and in some degree drunk- i no Stanley Burkeappearing-they hurried on their cloaks and overcoats, and went on their various ways surlily home. Meanwhile, what of Margaret? Awak- ing from her swoon, and discovering that Burke had indeed left the house, she took the arm of Hoffman, and went with him to the humble home of himself and wife; and fevered and sleepless upon a miserable bed-her child, which was also Stanley's child, sleeping beside her-this woman, the real owner of Henry Mor- gan's wealth-of Stanley Burke's grand house-muttered in her half-delirious dreams the words " to-morrow! to-mor- row!" The night passed on, and passed away, and yet Stanly Burke had not returned to his mansion. But a morning paper had this brief item: "At a late hour last night, ; person respectably dresed, in attempting to spring upon one of the Jeftey City ferry-boats, just as it was leaving the bridge, missed the boat and fell into the river. The night was dark and stormy, and the efforts made to save him were unavailing. He was not rescued from the waves until the "spark of life had fled." His body was taken charge of by coroner We were not able to obtain the name of the unfor. tunate man. he was dressed in black, and wore a Spanish cloak, lined with velvet; and a gold watch and diamond pin, together with a pocket-book, con- taining bank-notes and gold to the amount of $500, were found upon his person. The body will no doubt to-day be recognized and handed over to his friends." And that was the last of Stanly Burke. For it was Stanley Burke who. by ac- cident or with the idea of self-murder, had met his death in the river which only a month before had received the body of his victim. Here our sketch comes to a close. Who buried the unfortunate man? who came into possession of his estate? (in reality the estate of Morgan) what became of Margaret? are matters upon which it is not well to speak plainly. as the most important events which are de-  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7091-00000058"/> tailed in this narrative are of recent oc- currence. --(n ,T,e sunny day when Broadway is thrn 0i u with a current of fashion, youth and beauty, (and, for that matter, rags. old age and ugliness too,) when the sky is full ,f' spring, and the spire of old Trinity rises clearly into the cloudless blue. you may note among the crowd of faces a woman who is dressed in mourn- ing; that face, framed in a dark bonnet,   wears yet upon its colorless clhek, and in its large feverish eyes, some traces of early loveliness, but it is stamped with the -inevitable prophecy, of a death by consumption, of a broken heart, of am untimely grave.
