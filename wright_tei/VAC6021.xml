            <head>GLEASON'S PICTORIAL DRAWING-ROOM COMPANION,</head> 
            <head type="sub">A RECORD OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND USEFUL IN ART.</head> 
            <p>The object of this paper is to present, in the most elegant and available form, a weekly literary melange of notable events of the day. Its columns are devoted to original tales, sketches and poems by the BEST AMERICAN AUTHORS, and the cream of the domestic and foreign news; the whole well spiced with wit and humor. Each paper is BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED with numerous accurate engravings, by eminent artists, of notable objects, current events in all parts of the world, and of men and manners, altogether making a paper entirely original in its design in this country. Its pages contain views of every populous city in the known world, of all buildings of note in the eastern or western hemisphere, of all the principal ships and steamers of the navy and merchant service, with line portraits of every noted character in the world, male and female. Sketches of beautiful scenery, taken from life, are also given, with numerous specimens from the animal kingdom, the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea. The Companion is now printed on the finest of satin-surface paper, from a font of new and beautiful type, manufactured expressly for it,-presenting in its mechanical execution an elegant specimen of art. It contains fifteen hundred and sixty-four square inches, giving a great amount of reading matter and illustrations-a mammoth weekly paper of sixteen octavo pages. It forms THE BEST FAMILY PAPER, inasmuch as its aim is constantly, in connection with the fund of amusement it affords, and the rich array of original miscellany it presents, to inculcate the strictest and highest tone of morality, and to encourage virtue by holding up to view all that is good and pure, and avoiding all that is evil in its tendency. In short, the object is to make the paper loved, respected, and sought after for its combined excellences.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
                  <p>THE sun had risen from his ocean bed, and gilded the many spires and domes of this city, with a bright and sparkling radiance. The slated roofs of the buildings flashed back the dazzling rays like shields of burnished gold. The bright beams fell laviahly upon the numerous green islands that seemed reposing on the very bosom of the waters, and which looked a thousand times brighter than ever before. The clear blue sky, without a cloud, received a mellow, softer hue, as the bright orb of day rose higher and higher from his watery bed. A strong north westerly breeze swept down the bay, lashing the dark blue waters with the whitest foam. It was a lovely morn. A vast multitude of people had gathered upon the wharves and adjacent shores of the city, their gaze directed towards a beautiful schooner that lay anchored in the stream. She was about two hundred tons burthen, and of the finest and most symmetrical build, with great breadth of beam; her whole appearance indicative of matchless speed. Her hull was long, low, and jet black, only relieved by a narrow white ribbon, scarcely two inches in width, running round her waists from stem to stern. The bows were exceedingly sharp, from which extended a long, tapering bowsprit, terminating in a reed-like flying jib-boom.</p> 
                  <p>Her masts were long and raking, and tapered aloft to withes, and with the rest of her spars, were of a polished black.</p> 
                  <p>Her decks were of snowy whiteness, and flashed beneath the bright rays of the sun, like layers of purest silver. The binnacle, companion-way and hatches were neatly painted green, relieving the whiteness of the decks. She mounted twelve long brass eighteens, six on a side, and a forty-four amidships, on both sides<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6021-00000003"/> of which, in bright red letters was painted the name of "Thunderbolt," and from its looks well deserved the name. At the peak waved a small blue flag, on which was beautifully embroidered in silver thread, an arrow, near the centre of which, and embroidered in gold, was a small pair of cupid's wings. The device designated the name of the beautiful schooner-"The Flying Arrow."</p> 
                  <p>No eye could have detected the least fault in the finished outline of the beautiful craft, as she rested like a feather, gracefully upon the crested waves. Upon her decks were a score of young and fearless-looking fellows, all similarly attired in white flowing pants, blue checked shirts, and a black silk handkerchief, knotted loosely round the neck of each; while on their heads they wore caps of rich blue silk, each ornamented with a tassel of silver.</p> 
                  <p>Upon the quarter-deck paced a young man who, every now and then, cast an expectant glance towards one of the wharves, from which a boat seemed to be on the point of starting.</p> 
                  <p>Over his blue check, he wore a round blue jacket, ornamented on each shoulder with a band of silver. His face was handsome and expressive of courage and daring; and his step, as he paced the smoothly polished deck, was light and easy. Taking from a pocket a small spy-glass, he levelled it towards the place, where, within a few moments, he had looked anxiously several times. Suddenly he cried out in a loud clear tone, "all hands on deck."</p> 
                  <p>From the several gangways now poured forth the crew of the beautiful vessel; and in one moment, one hundred as fine fellows as ever called the sea their home, stood upon the decks of the schooner. At the moment the young man had spoken, the boat had put off from the wharf nearly opposite to where the schooner lay, and was nearing rapidly; it was propelled by six oarsmen, and skimmed the waves like a feather. Five minutes from the time it left the wharf it was alongside; and, in a moment, a young man dressed as a naval officer, ascended the side of the vessel, and leaped lightly upon the deck.</p> 
                  <p>This was the commander of the Flying Arrow, which name was beautifully painted upon the stern of the schooner. He was a young man of fine and graceful figure, with a carriage lofty and commanding, and a step firm and elastic. His features were regular and handsome, and his complexion dark and of rich color. His hair was wavy and coal black; and a pair of well-trimmed whiskers of the same hue ornamented and added a fulness to his well-shaped face. His eyes were black, and for brightness mocked the eagle's. His face was expressive of boldness and resolution. His thin and beautifully chiselled lips closed firmly, giving to his face a look of singular daring and decision. He smiled as he gazed on the neatly dressed and faithful looking crew around him, who, as they caught sight of their commander, gave vent to their feelings in a loud and welcome cheer; every cap was at the feet of its owner, in obeisance and loyalty to their young captain, who returned their greeting in a kindly manner.</p> 
                  <p>He was soon joined by the young man whom we noticed upon the quarter-deck, and who was the lieutenant of the Flying Arrow.</p> 
                  <p>"Thanks, thanks, Albert," said the commander, grasping heartily the hand of the young man. "Thanks, for securing so noble and gallant a crew;-they look well worthy of their present home, the Flying Arrow; may they be an honor to her, and their country, as long as they sail under the star-spangled banner."</p> 
                  <p>"I have no fears of them," replied the young man proudly, as he gazed on the fearless looking young sailors. "They are good men and true."</p> 
                  <p>"I trust so."</p> 
                  <p>"Albert, in an hour we must be fairly under way; when fairly so, come to my cabin." With this, the noble looking young officer descended to a splendid cabin in the schooner. In less than an hour the schooner was gliding rapidly over the snow-capped waves, ploughing the white foam till it lay in snowy masses along her sides; when, meeting at the stern, formed a beautiful tossing wake behind.</p> 
                  <p>Her spread of canvass was enormous, and hurried her over the waves at an astonishing velocity. The tall, slender masts yielded some-what to the large square topsails, which were now filled to their utmost tension, and seemed almost incapable of sustaining their heavy pressure.</p> 
                  <p>On leaving her moorings in the stream, a gun had been fired, and a roll of bunting run aloft, which unfolded to the breeze, and the stars and stripes waved proudly over the decks of the privateer, for such was the Flying Arrow. Three loud and hearty cheers burst from the crew as they beheld the flag waving above, and had hardly died away ere the whole multitude upon the shores burst forth as if in one voice, in a loud and swelling shout, which was repeated at intervals, until the fast receding schooner was wholly lost to view on her way to the blue Atlantic; where for a time we leave her.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <p>WARREN and William Seymour were twin brothers, sons of a wealthy gentleman of Boston, and at the time of our story, were five and twenty years of age.</p> 
                  <p>A man of immense wealth, Mr. Seymour had spared neither pains nor expense in the education and advancement of his sons; everything that could possibly tend to their welfare and happiness, was bestowed with a liberal hand. Six years of their lives had been spent in the naval service, and both the young men had risen to the lieutenantcy. Endowed by nature, with fine personal appearance, and both equally skillful in naval tactics, two finer looking officers never walked a quarter-deck. In form and feature, the two brothers were singularly alike; one was the exact counterpart of the other; the only distinguishable difference between the two was the color of their eyes. Those of Warren were of inky blackness, while those of William were of a fine dark blue.</p> 
                  <p>With the exception of the eyes, the slightest difference could never have been detected in the young men. Alike in outward appearance, they were totally unlike in disposition. William, from a boy, had been possessed of a rash and jealous temperament, which age and circumstances had by no means improved. Of a fierce, fiery temper, haughty and unforgiving, he was little calculated to win friends from among his acquaintances. The least imagined insult or injury he would not brook, or forgive; and woe to the one who crossed him; he was sure to have revenge.</p> 
                  <p>Jealousy and revenge were the two prominent traits in his character, and were rooted deep within his soul. Cold, haughty and distrustful, he confided nought to others; his thoughts were locked within him; and many were the dark ones that filled his breast. Yet, there were times when he was gay, lively, and apparently the happiest of the happy; when a nobler nature seemed to have sprung up within him, and drove all evil out; when his face seemed to glow with noble purpose and resolve. But, suddenly, as the sun is sometimes veiled by the dark thunder-cloud, would his face become clouded with the dark passions of his soul, his dark eyes flash with fearful fire, and his whole nature seemed changed. Such was William Seymour.</p> 
                  <p>Warren was opposite in nature, in almost every respect. Generous, frank and open-hearted, kindly disposed towards all, he was as little calculated to make enemies, as was William to make friends. His was a soul noble from the first; which had never been corrupted by the darker passions of human nature; and as yet remained bright, pure and unsullied. Born of the same mother, reared with the same care, both possessing the same and equal advantages; yet how widely different were their natures; how unlike were the two brothers-one was destined to tread the bright path to honor and fame; the other, the dark, unfathomable road to ruin and death.</p> 
                  <p>A short time after their promotion to the lieutenantcy, the two brothers visited their home after an absence of three years. Till then, from their earliest infancy, despite their opposite natures, the brothers had been constant and affectionate friends. Seldom an angry word passed between them; whatever the feelings entertained towards others by William, to Warren he always bore kindly feelings. But the bond of friendship and brotherly love was soon destined to be severed.</p> 
                  <p>It was at the close of a beautiful afternoon, near the expiration of the leave granted the brothers, that they were returning from an afternoon's ride through the beautiful environs of the city. They were riding leisurely along through Cambridge, and were within a half mile of the bridge, when their attention was roused by the quick clattering of a horse's hoofs behind them, and at the same moment, a piercing shriek fell upon their ears. Turning on the instant, they beheld a noble steed attached to a light buggy wagon dashing madly over the road towards them, and now within a short distance. The occupant of the carriage was a young lady who had no control whatever over the horse, which was upon the dead run. Quickly turning their carriage to one side of the road, the young men alighted and fastened their horse to a tree. Hardly had they done so, ere they heard the voice of the young lady in the buggy-which was now within a few feet of them-crying, "Oh God! save me, save me!" William Seymour sprang to the road as the horse dashed past him, and seized him by the head. The horse reared and plunged fearfully, and William would have been obliged to let go his hold, had not Warren at that moment seized the horse's head from the other side. By their united efforts they succeeded in arresting the course of the frightened animal, who, in a few moments stood perfectly still.</p> 
                  <p>The joy of the young lady at her deliverance was beyond all bounds; her thanks and blessings were without number. She was a darkeyed maiden of eighteen or twenty summers, with a faultless form and exquisite features. Her face was pale from fear, yet lovely as the houris. Both were struck by her matchless beauty, and in the bosom of William, the fire of love was already kindled. Recovering from her fear, a conversation was happily begun by the young lady herself. To Warren Seymour, who was by far the most agreeable of the brothers in conversation, she most directed it, though by no means slighting his brother. The manner of William had changed of a sudden. His brow was dark, and his eyes, as he gazed at his brother, engaged in conversation with the young lady, blazed with a fiendish light. His replies to her, who frequently addressed him, were moody and repulsive, and often nought but a monosyllable. Perceiving his mood, the young lady now addressed herself wholly to Warren. Both were evidently pleased with each other, and the conversation was lively and agreeable. Burning with jealousy and rage, William was about to leave them, when a horse and chaise driven rapidly down the road, stopped directly by him. An elderly gentleman alighted, exclaiming in a tone of joy, "Thank God, thank God, she's safe."</p> 
                  <p>The young lady sprang to his arms. It was her father.</p> 
                  <p>Returning from an afternoon's ride, he had stopped at the house of a friend, and spoke with<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6021-00000005"/> him for a moment at his door. While there, his horse became frightened and ran far out of sight, till stopped providentially by the two brothers.</p> 
                  <p>The young lady now related to her father of the fearful' ride, and providential rescue by the two young men who had perilled their lives for her.</p> 
                  <p>The heart of Mr. Wildon overflowed with gratitude towards the preservers of his daughter, and grasping their hands exclaimed,</p> 
                  <p>"You're brave boys, by my faith, and shall have reward. Anything, everything, all I have is yours, if you'll take it. By my faith, if there were but one, he should have my daughter, but how indeed to give her to both of you, I can't tell. But come, don't be bashful, name a reward, for by my faith, you deserve one."</p> 
                  <p>"We ask no reward, generous sir," said Warren, "but that of you and your daughter's acquaintance and friendship."</p> 
                  <p>"By my faith, you shall have mine from this moment," said Mr. Wildon, shaking their hands heartily.</p> 
                  <p>"As to Clara, I suppose she'll have no objections to your acquaintance-will you, Jude?"</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly not, dear father," said Clara Wildon, "I shall forever owe them gratitude, and shall be proud and happy of their acquaintance and friendship."</p> 
                  <p>"A mighty pretty speech, miss, now kiss them both, Jude, or you're no daughter of old Harry Wildon."</p> 
                  <p>The handsome Clara slightly blushed at the unexpected request of her father, but turning to William she kissed him, and severely chided him for his ill-humor. Turning then to Warren, their eyes met, and "told a tale." Drawing the lovely girl towards him, Warren imprinted upon her lips a burning kiss of love, which she returned.</p> 
                  <p>"That's the right sort!" exclaimed Mr. Wildon, laughing heartily, "that's the right sort. Now, young gentlemen, your names; you are brothers, I'm certain; and how in time either of you can tell himself from the other, I can't see."</p> 
                  <p>"Holloa!" he ejaculated, turning to where William had stood, but who was now gone,-"he's vanished, by my faith."</p> 
                  <p>"He's gone for his carriage," said Clara, pointing to where the two young men had left it, and who, in their struggle with the horse of Mr. Wildon, had been dragged a considerable distance down the road.</p> 
                  <p>Giving him their names, and learning the residence of Mr. Wildon, which was in Boston, Warren politely handed Clara Wildon to her seat in her father's carriage, and then sprang into his own vehicle which was now upon the spot.</p> 
                  <p>The sun was just setting as the two carriages rolled slowly over the bridge. The west was lined with clouds of gorgeous hues, which the clear still waters of the "Charles" reflected beautifully back.</p> 
                  <p>Within one short hour, both Warren and William Seymour had drank deep from the fountain of love; yet, how different were their feelings. To Warren, a new life seemed to have opened its portals to his heart. His feelings were strange and unaccountable, yet pleasing.</p> 
                  <p>Love, which before he had never known, he felt he now possessed. He felt conscious that he loved the fair girl whom he and his brother had saved from danger, perhaps from death; and a secret whispering within seemed to say "love on."</p> 
                  <p>Filled with bright and pleasing thoughts, he was lively, gay and happy.</p> 
                  <p>Not so with William; he was gloomy and silent. He, too, felt conscious of love wakened in his breast; love for Clara Wildon; but the spark of love had kindled the deadly fire of jealousy.</p> 
                  <p>Fortunate was it for her that they were there to save; but better had it been for them, had they never seen her; for from that moment all brotherly ties were severed. Fierce jealousy, and all the darker passions of his heart were roused in the breast of William, and in the place of love, burned deep and deadly hate.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
                  <p>HE would have given worlds if he alone had saved Clara Wildon; but alone he could have done naught with the maddened and powerful horse: and as it was, but half the deed was his.</p> 
                  <p>"Come and see us to-morrow," said Mr Wildon to the young men, as the carriages were about to separate in the city. "Come and see us to-morrow, you dogs; if you don't I'll shoot both of you-I will, by my faith,"uttering his favorite phrase.</p> 
                  <p>"We shall come, never fear; for we have no taste for cold lead," said Warren, laughing; and bidding adieu to Clara and her father, he drove rapidly away.</p> 
                  <p>The next day found Warren at the house of Mr. Wildon, and from that time till the expiration of his leave was he a constant visitor.</p> 
                  <p>William had also often visited there, but never in company with his brother, with whom, since the afternoon of their ride, he had scarcely spoken. He was also a welcome visitor, and many hours he spent in the society of Clara Wildon, by whom he was always joyfully received. Her sincere and heartfelt gratitude he mistook for love, and ere, his departure he determined to declare his passion, tell her of his love, and claim her as his bride.</p> 
                  <p>At the request of Warren, their leave was extended a considerable length of time, much to the satisfaction of both the young men.</p> 
                  <p>Several weeks more strengthened in the breast of William the burning passion for Clara Wildon, and seemed to confirm him in the opinion that his love was returned. His determination to declare to her his love was kept. Then it was he became aware that he had mistaken gratitude for love. Then it was that he became aware of a rival, and that rival, his brother. Dark thoughts filled his soul, and he inwardly swore that never should Clara Wildon be the bride of his rival brother.</p> 
                  <p>He abruptly took his departure from the city and rejoined his ship. There were but few who welcomed him back; but for this he cared not; he courted the society of none. He had loved; his love had been rejected; his brother was the successful and now hated rival. His whole soul was now wrapped in an absorbing thought, one<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6021-00000006"/> dark passion-revenge-and he swore to accomplish his revenge, even though a crime of the darkest dye should mark it.</p> 
                  <p>It was early one morning, as he was pacing the deck of the frigate, that he was joined by a young officer, a lieutenant like himself.</p> 
                  <p>"Seymour, we have got a new comer here," said the young man, addressing him, "you must see him, he's a fine looking fellow."</p> 
                  <p>"Where's he from? What rank does he hold?" inquired Seymour.</p> 
                  <p>"He's from the 'Chesapeake,' and of the same rank as yourself. What say, shall I introduce you?"</p> 
                  <p>"As you please," answered Seymour, indifferently.</p> 
                  <p>Both now approached a fine looking young man, who was at the time leaning upon the bulwarks of the frigate, gazing upon the glassy waters around. He turned as the two approached, and bowed to both.</p> 
                  <p>"Albert Almont!" exclaimed Seymour, in a fierce tone of surprise, as he recognized the features of the young man, "Albert Almont do I see?"</p> 
                  <p>"As true as I see William Seymour," answered the other in an equally surprised tone; at the same time offering his hand to Seymour.</p> 
                  <p>It was taken somewhat reluctantly by Seymour, who said, "You have my hand, not as your friend but as your foe. Albert Almont, I have not forgotten that blow-it must be cancelled. Almont, this frigate's decks are not broad enough for you and I." Uttering this in a dark, meaning tone, he turned and left the spot.</p> 
                  <p>"You know this young Seymour then?" said Fitz Alwyn, the young officer who had joined Seymour in his promenade to Almont.</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, well do I know him," answered Almont, "though it is six years since we have met."</p> 
                  <p>"Six years! I'faith he must have an India rubber memory. He talks about a blow he's not forgotten. Six years! i'faith, 'tis long enough to forget one's own father. But that's a dark hint he threw out about these decks not being wide enough for himself and you. I can read that. Almont, he'll send you a challenge."</p> 
                  <p>"Pshaw!" said Almont, with a sneer.</p> 
                  <p>"You may pshaw and be hanged," said Fitz Alwyn, with a nod and a wink. "But if you don't receive a challenge from Bill Seymour within the hour, I'll pledge myself to ride a porpoise from here to the South Sea Islands, without saddle or bridle, on a voyage of discovery."</p> 
                  <p>"I should be sorry to task thy ability to such an extent," said Almont, laughing at the idea of this humorous ride. "But you may as well look for your porpoise."</p> 
                  <p>"What was the cause of his strange words?" asked Fitz Alwyn.</p> 
                  <p>"You shall know. Seymour and myself were fellow-students at the same academy. One day he openly and grossly insulted a young lady belonging to the academy, in presence of a number of other young ladies and gentlemen. I openly punished his insolence; with one blow I felled him to the feet of her whom he had insulted. He arose, and with an oath I'll not repeat, he swore revenge. He immediately left the academy for fear of being expelled; and from that time till within the hour, I have not seen him."</p> 
                  <p>"I'faith, served him right; but he never forgets or forgives a blow. You'll have a challenge, or I don't know Bill Seymour."</p> 
                  <p>Fitz Alwyn turned and was about to leave, when a lad presented to Almont a letter.</p> 
                  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed he, as he noticed this. "Ha! ha! I'll wager the buttons on my coat 'tis a challenge."</p> 
                  <p>Almont broke the seal and read the missive; and, with a smile, he handed it to Alwyn.</p> 
                  <p>"I'faith, capital, as I told you, Almont," said Alwyn, in a lively tone. "I'm to be his second; you accept, of course; weapons, pistols; distance, ten paces. I'faith, capital, capital."</p> 
                  <p>"Alwyn, you have read his challenge, you shall read my answer." Saying this, Almont descended below.</p> 
                   
                  <p>An hour after William Seymour had despatched his challenge to Almont, he received the following answer:</p> 
                  <q>
                     <floatingText xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">

                           <div type="letter"> 
                              <p>"LIEUT. SEYMOUR: Sir,-I received your challenge. I accept or reject it at your will. Never will I disgrace the profession to which I belong by fighting a duel. Never before have I received a challenge. This I accept only upon one condition; which is, that you and myself throw up our commissions. Then, as common citizens, we may disgrace ourselves, but not our profession. Upon this, and no other condition, do I accept the challenge.</p>

                                 <signed>ALBERT ALMONT."</signed> 
                                 <address>

                  </q> 
                  <p>As Seymour read this answer, a dark, meaning smile passed his lips, his eyes flashed fiercely bright, and in a deep, quick tone, he said, "By heaven! he shall fight or-" "die," was the word whispered in his ear. He turned; Fitz Alwyn stood beside him.</p> 
                  <p>Three days after this, the lifeless body of a young naval officer was found at early morn upon one of the slips of the city of New York. The body was immediately conveyed to the nearest house, where every possible means were used to restore life to the inanimate form; and it was found that life was not wholly extinct, though but a spark remained. After a short lapse of time, the young officer was restored somewhat to consciousness. It was young Almont. He had received a severe stab in the region of the heart, which had nigh proved fatal. Who the author of this foul deed was, none knew but himself. He recovered, and kept the secret. He had been pressed by many to reveal the one who had well nigh been his murderer. But in vain; the secret was locked within his own breast-the assassin was safe. Three weeks passed. A beautiful day was drawing to a close, as Warren Seymour appeared upon the decks of the noble frigate Constitution. A number of officers were lounging about the decks; but the first one he noticed and to whom he spoke was Almont. Uttering an exclamation of surprise and pleasure, he grasped both hands of the young man and shook them heartily. They had been old friends and fellow students. Both he and his brother had attended the same academy with Almont.</p> 
                  <p>"But where is William?" asked he of Almont. "I do not see him here," he said, as he gazed round upon the various groups about the decks, all of whom heartily welcomed his return.</p> 
                  <p>"'Tis three weeks since he has been seen on these decks," answered Almont.</p> 
                  <p>"Three weeks!" exclaimed Seymour, in surprise. "He left Boston three weeks before me; has he not been here?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, he has been here, but is gone, no one knows where," said Almont, in a sad tone.</p> 
                  <p>Seymour seemed for a moment lost in thought.</p> 
                  <p>"Well," he said at length, "his career is before him; a bright or a dark one. I fear for that brother of mine. I fear me, his head strong passions will be his bane. But 'tis not for me to meddle with his affairs."</p> 
                  <p>"But Almont," he continued, "you have altered since we met. Six years have paled, fearfully paled thy face. You were not always so; for I remember that there were but few who could boast of richer blood than thou."</p> 
                  <p>"I had well nigh been paler," said Almont, with a slight but forced smile playing round his lips.</p> 
                  <p>He now related to Seymour of the attempted assassination, to which he had well nigh been a victim.</p> 
                  <p>"But have you no clue to this fiend in human shape?" asked Seymour, a slight tremor pervading his voice.</p> 
                  <p>"If this is any clue," said Almont, taking from his pocket the point of a small dagger, stained with blood, "I have."</p> 
                  <p>The face of Seymour turned deadly pale at the sight of this, and at the same moment he drew forth a small hilted dagger broken at the point. The broken blade exactly matched the point which Almont had preserved. For a<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6021-00000007"/> moment Seymour stood silent; his form was terribly agitated, his face was still pale, and his eyes, in that short moment, spoke volumes of anguish. With a voice of forced calmness, yet husky with inward emotion, he spoke.</p> 
                  <p>"My brother! my brother! O God! that this should be his deed. A deed of blood rests on his head. Yet thank God! he is not a murderer!"</p> 
                  <p>Dropping the broken dagger to the deck, he buried his face in his hands; while Almont and others who had gathered around looked upon him in silent pity.</p> 
                  <p>The hilt of the dagger bore the initials "W. S." William Seymour was the owner. It was a present to him from his friend and almost only companion, Fitz Alwyn.</p> 
                  <p>By mere accident, it had come in possession of Warren Seymour that very afternoon. As he was about to put off for his ship, he observed in the hands of a lad, a number of whom were playing about the slip, a small dagger. He accosted the lad, and inquired of him how he came in possession of the costly weapon. The boy answered that he had found it, telling him at the same time that a man had been stabbed at a short distance from where he had found the dagger, ending by asking Seymour if he would buy it. Warren took the weapon, and to his surprise, he found it to be the dagger which had been presented to his brother by Fitz Alwyn. The boy demanded rather an exorbitant price for his prize, which was, however, purchased by Warren. His first thought was that his brother had been attacked by some ruffian, and, in defending himself, had broken and lost his dagger.</p> 
                  <p>The reader may judge of his feelings, when he found that, instead of defending his own life, his brother had attempted the life of another.</p> 
                  <p>The disappearance of William Seymour was now explained. He had fled to avoid the punishment of the crime so much merited.</p> 
                  <p>Overcome with sorrow and shame for the-flagrant crime of his brother, Warren resolved to resign his commission and return home for a time. And if in time of need his country should require his services, he would then devote them wholly to her interest. For the position of affairs between the two countries, the United States and England, at that time, was precarious in the extreme.</p> 
                  <p>Warren Seymour warmly pressed his friend Almont to accompany him, urging, as a reason, that he would be benefited by him-that he would receive better care than on board a man-of-war. For without good care, his wound might yet prove fatal to him. After some urging, Almont consented to accompany his loved friend Seymour. He was an orphan, and Seymour resolved that from that time his home should be his friend's also. In a few days they were on their way to Boston.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
                  <p>IT was a number of days after the departure of Warren Seymour from Clara Wildon, that she lay one afternoon reclining upon a couch in a small summer-house or arbor, built out from her father's mansion. It was a beautiful place, commanding a delightful view of the broad bay, with its islands of green, resting upon its blue waters.</p> 
                  <p>From the arbor, two large windows opened out upon a large and elegantly laid out garden, with broad winding paths of whitest gravel. A goodly number of fruit trees were interspersed throughout the garden, which was otherwise covered with rose-bushes, flowers, and plants of every description. This arbor, the favorite place of resort of Clara Wildon, was tastefully and even elegantly furnished. The floor was carpeted with the best of Brussels, figured with flowers of every kind. The walls were prepared with rich landscape drawings, and hung round with paintings, old and valuable; while round the room near the walls were vases containing roses of the most beautiful and rarest description, which filled the room with the richest and sweetest perfume.</p> 
                  <p>This lovely place was styled by Clara the Rose Room, and many of her leisure hours were spent within its fragrant walls. Reclining upon the couch, she had been engaged in reading for nearly an hour, when she was startled by the entrance of some person from the garden. She dropped her book and sprang to her feet.</p> 
                  <p>"William Seymour!" exclaimed Clara, in a surprised, yet not displeased tone. "William Seymour here! Your presence was wholly unexpected, but nevertheless welcome, and at this time particularly so, for I am quite lonesome here and entirely alone in the house. But me thought you had left the city and rejoined your ship."</p> 
                  <p>"I did," said Seymour, in answer. "But my leave has not yet expired, and love-love for thee, dearest Clara, has brought me back, and at thy feet." Saying this, he took her fair white hand, and kneeling at her feet, kissed her trembling fingers.</p> 
                  <p>She withdrew her hand, uttering at the same time an exclamation, half displeasure, half fear.</p> 
                  <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6021-00000008"/> 
                  <p>"Nay, nay, sweetest Clara," said Seymour, rising, "do not be angry with me for the love I bear thee. Blame not me, but thyself, dear girl," said he, again taking her hand within his. "Blame not me, but your peerless beauty, your matchless charms; if they have caused this heart to burn with love, oh, more than love for thee, 'tis thy fault, beauteous Clara. Thy charms, which kindled within this breast deep, burning love for thee, have added within this moment twofold to the already overheated, burning passion."</p> 
                  <p>Encircling his arm around the slender waist of the beauteous girl, he imprinted upon her lips a burning kiss of passion.</p> 
                  <p>Displeased and alarmed at his vehement words and actions, she disengaged herself from his embrace, and would have fled, had he not seized and detained her.</p> 
                  <p>"William Seymour," said she, in a spirited and angry tone, "I must not hear you talk thus.Once before have you unfolded to me the fierce passion you entertain towards me. Once have I told you my feelings, and to a gentleman once would be enough. William Seymour, I esteem you as a friend, love you as a brother, and to one who was, perchance, the preserver of my life, I shall always owe the deepest gratitude. But love you as you would wish, I never can. William Seymour, if you have any respect for a woman, for me, in heaven's name, pray leave me."</p> 
                  <p>And burying her face in her hands, she sank weeping to the couch.</p> 
                  <p>Seymour gazed in silence for a moment upon the lovely girl; then breaking silence, said:</p> 
                  <p>"Clara Wildon, from your lips I would know one thing.Do you love my brother?."</p> 
                  <p>"I do."</p> 
                  <p>"Enough, 'tis as I believed. Infernal war-plot. He knows a maiden's love. He shall also know a brother's hate-a brother's REVENGE!"</p> 
                  <p>What a change a moment had worked on him. The winning smile, the gentle manner he had assumed, the mild words, all had fled; and in the place of these, fury, lust, and the darkest passions of his soul were roused from their slumber within.</p> 
                  <p>"Clara Wildon,"he said, in a low, deep tone, "Clara Wildon, I love, madly love you. My love you rejected; and, by heaven, you shall now receive the embrace of him whose love you have scorned. It shall now be your turn to sue-and sue in vain."</p> 
                  <p>"In the name of heaven, what mean you, William Seymour?" shrieked Clara, in a voice of startling terror.</p> 
                  <p>"That we are alone. That you are in my power," answered Seymour, in a voice of fearful meaning.</p> 
                  <p>"How know you that we are alone?" asked Clara, forgetting in her fright that she had herself told him.</p> 
                  <p>"Your own sweet lips informed me," answered he, in a mocking tone.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, sweet dove, to my embrace now come. Nay, but you shall. By heaven! I'll not be baffled now. I've gone too far to recede."</p> 
                  <p>The terrified maiden shrunk back at his approach.</p> 
                  <p>"William Seymour, you will not harm me," said she, in a tone of anguish. "You who saved my life, will not take it. Nay, more than life-my honor."</p> 
                  <p>"Do not touch me, or I'll scream."</p> 
                  <p>"Scream if you will. You'll not be heard," and he grasped her hands. Quick as thought she disengaged them, and as the frightened hare starts at the sight of the hound, did she start from the ruthless villain.</p> 
                  <p>But he was as quick. Ere she had fled three paces he seized her by the waist, and struggling, he forced her to a couch. Uttering a piercing shriek of agony, she fainted. She was lost.</p> 
                  <p>Seymour gazed on his victim with a fiend-like, exulting smile. From her lips he ravished a kiss, another and other. From her heaving bosom he tore her snow white dress; but before his ruthless hands had profaned that fount of innocence and purity, he was torn from her, and hurled with superhuman force across the apartment, where he fell with a crash so stunning, as would seem to have broken every bone in his mortal body.</p> 
                  <p>One moment more, and the desires of the villain would have been accomplished.</p> 
                  <p>"Monster! fiend!" burst from the lips of Warren Seymour, as he gazed from the inanimate form of his betrothed, to the prostrate form of his fiendlike brother.</p> 
                  <p>"Monster! well it is for thee that thou art my brother, or thy heart's blood would have been the forfeit of thy devilish crime."</p> 
                  <p>"Away fiend! murderer!" said he, as his brother rose slowly to his feet. "Away, murderer,-ay, worse than a murderer; for he who would by brutal force ravish from a helpless woman the choicest of God's gifts, her virtue, is worse than a murderer. Away, or a brother's blood may not protect thee."</p> 
                  <p>William Seymour rose to his feet. His face was livid with rage and hatred. His eyes blazed with a terrible fire. A hellish smile of the fiend incarnate wreathed his lips, as he gazed on his rival brother. For a moment he stood as if chained to the spot; then as sudden as the concealed tiger darts upon its unsuspecting prey, he sprang with an uplifted dagger upon his brother, and aimed a deadly blow at his heart. But the fatal blow was arrested, he was seized by a powerful arm and again hurled to the floor, and his dagger sent ringing across the room. Young Almont was the preserver of his friend's life.</p> 
                  <p>Seymour again rose to his feet, and in a voice husky with rage and passion, he said:</p> 
                  <p>"Warren Seymour, you have had your day; mine is to come. I go, but I leave a brother's curse; and may it forever rest on thee and him. Warren Seymour, you shall yet know a brother's vengeance."Then turning to Almont, he said: "The blow I aimed at thee, which failed to reach its home, and thus robbed me of revenge, may, ere long, again be struck. Beware!" Saying this, he sprang into the garden and disappeared.</p> 
                  <p>Warren Seymour and his friend Almont had that very day arrived in the city; and a few hours after their arrival, had together sought the residence of Clara Wildon. Entering by the garden, Warren had hoped to surprise her in her favorite retreat. When near the arbor, a piercing shriek came from within; he sprang in through the window, and saved his betrothed Clara from dishonor-from the foul embrace of his libertine brother.</p> 
                  <p>Almont had remained without, but at the danger of his friend he sprang in and saved him from the blade of the desperado.</p> 
                  <p>Twelve months flew by; and since the day of the fearful scene in the arbor, William Seymour had not been seen or heard of. Another month was added to the twelve; when, one day, a letter was put into the hands of Warren Seymour-it bore a black seal. The letter contained but a few words, written in a strange hand. It told the fate of William Seymour. He had challenged-he had fought-and fell. He had died among strangers, with not a friend to mourn his fall or weep his death.</p> 
                  <p>Such was the closing of his dark career; thus he died in the prime of life, a victim to his ungovernable passion.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
                  <p>DURING the year past, the prospect of an amicable adjustment of the existing difficulties between this and the mother country, had become daily more dark and unpromising. War with its devastating influence seemed inevitable. Every breeze wafted the tidings of tyranny and oppression. Every gale bore the cries of outraged and impressed seamen. Bound on their own decks-torn from beneath the outraged flag of freedom, and compelled in the warships of Britain, to fight her battles.</p> 
                  <p>Hundreds and hundreds of American seamen were thus cruelly impressed in the service of Britain. And hundreds and hundreds more would share the same fate if the day of retribution was delayed. Not a bosom but what impatiently awaited that day; not a bosom but burned to avenge the wrongs sustained by their fellow freemen. In addition to these cruel outrages, to which our merchantmen were subjected, were the depredations of a daring and unprincipled rover, who, during the year past, had infested the Atlantic shores. The deeds and exploits of this free rover were of the most sanguinary and daring character: frequently attacking large merchantmen, within sight of their havens; murdering their crews within sight of their homes.</p> 
                  <p>Many a good ship had cleared her port, anxiously watched by hundreds, who dreaded lest the terrible buccaneer should cross her track ere she reached her destined port. Too often were their fears realized. The corsair once more upon the scent, the chase was doomed. To elude him was impossible. So frequent and so fearful were the deeds of the buccaneer, that the name of the Black Vulture had become a terror to the whole Atlantic coast. With the free flag aloft, the Black Vulture roamed the Atlantic; and her bloody wake was traced upon the dark waters from the north to the south.</p> 
                  <p>One day hovering like a bird of prey around the harbors of the North; another, gliding o'er the sunny waters of the South. Her speed was like the wind. She had outstripped the fastest cruiser in the navy sent out for her capture, and had gained among the sailors an enviable appellation, "The Devil's own." For it was averred by many, that when in sight and full chase of the corsair, she would disappear in the twinkling of an eye, and no trace of her was to be seen, or aught in view that bore the least resemblance to a pirate. And not one that was at all inclined to superstition (of which there was not a few among the sailors of that day) but what swore she was commanded by the Evil One himself. How she so often eluded those in pursuit of her, was the deepest mystery to all. One of her most daring piracies was committed in the very sight of a man-of-war. Overhauling one day, a large ship, she fired into her an extra round of grape and canister. At the first fire, the colors of the merchantman were struck. She was boarded by the pirates, who, enraged and disappointed in not having obtained a richer prize, after running into the very teeth of a man-of-war, drove every soul of the crew into the sea, and fired the vessel. On leaving her they fired a gun, and hoisted their terrible flag, as if in defiance of the frigate which was fast approaching, but which was soon left far behind by the light-winged corsair. Hardly could a journal be taken in hand, but what some flaming account of this terrible buccaneer appeared in its columns.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! that I had a craft of my own, that I might scour and rid the Atlantic of this terrible scourge!" exclaimed Warren Seymour in a passionate tone, his blood boiling with indignation on reading an account of a recent capture and horrible butchery of the crew of a merchantman by the Black Vulture. "Would that I had a craft, the match in speed of this corsair; once in her wake I would swear to rid the waters of the demon craft, or sink my own in the attempt."</p> 
                  <p>It was on that day that Warren Seymour received the letter containing the account of his brother's death. Three months from that time, the proclamation of war was issued against Great Britain.</p> 
                  <p>A short time after the declaration, Warren Seymour was prostrated by a malignant fever, which had well nigh terminated fatally. For three months he was confined a close prisoner to his chamber. During this period he was subject to fits of raving madness. In the course of these spells, the imagination of his wandering brain carried him from his sick-chamber to the battle ship. One moment, as if in the excitement of the chase, as one in command, would he issue all necessary orders to a crew-then, as if in the midst of battle, would his voice ring wildly through the chamber, shouting in a vehement manner to his officers and crew; his orders accompanied by the wildest gestures of his arms, as if fiercely wielding the sword, or grappling with the foe; and lashing himself in his frenzy, till big drops of sweat stood on his fevered brow; and exhausted nature refusing its support, the victim sank into profound slumber, only to wake again in madness. During his sickness, the beautiful Clara Wildon had been a constant watcher at the bedside of her lover, day and night; hardly allowed herself repose sufficient to sustain nature. Young Almont was also a constant attendant at the bedside of his friend, over whom he watched with a brother's care. At length, the fearful spells of madness left him; his health began slowly to recover, but several months had elapsed ere he had wholly regained his strength.</p> 
                  <p>One beautiful morning, after Warren Seymour had become wholly convalescent, he and his friend Almont were engaged in conversation relative to their immediate re-entrance into the navy. Their conversation had lasted some time, when they were interrupted by the presence of Mr. Seymour, who invited and requested the young men to accompany himself and a few friends on board a privateer, which, a short time before had arrived in the harbor.</p> 
                  <p>"Would that it was an order for me to rejoin the noble 'Constitution,'" said Warren as he rose to accompany his father. "I long to be upon her decks, and ere long, I trust I shall be."</p> 
                  <p>In the hall, he met the party of his father, and among them, to his inexpressible satisfaction, was Mr. Wildon and his daughter.</p> 
                  <p>"So you go with us, Mr. Madman," said Clara, laughing, as Warren took her hand.-<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6021-00000010"/> "I'll wager this ring that once on the deck of the privateer, we shall have a repetition of those highly wrought nautical ravings, which you so favored us with in your mad dreams. But come, Mr. Madcap, or we shall be left."</p> 
                  <p>A few minutes' walk brought the party to the end of India wharf, then the principal pier in the city. Exactly opposite the pier, about a quarter of a mile distant, lay the privateer, one of the most beautiful crafts that ever rested upon the waters of Boston Bay. Embarking aboard of a boat at the end of the pier, the party were soon alongside of the privateer, and upon her decks. An hour was spent in the examination of the beautiful vessel, which afforded to Warren, in particular, the utmost gratification. He was pleased, ay, enraptured with the sight of everything around him. Everything about the beautiful schooner was arranged with the nicest nautical precision.</p> 
                  <p>"O, that I had the command of this schooner," said Seymour in a tone of rapturous feeling, as he finished the survey of the privateer. "Have you the command of this vessel?" asked he of a young officer upon the quarter deck, to whom he had seen several of the crew respectfully touch their hats.</p> 
                  <p>"For the present I have,"was the reply.-"Would your place were mine, and I possessed it; half the wealth of yonder city I would give for the command of this matchless craft."</p> 
                  <p>She was indeed matchless, and well-deserved the many encomiums of praise he lavished upon her. As perfect a craft as eye could model, or hand could fashion, was the privateer.</p> 
                  <p>"You set a high value on the command,"said the officer, laughing. "Yet without your high price, shall your wish be gratified. I hold the command of this beautiful 'nymph of the waves' till I resign her to one more worthy-her future commander-Warren Seymour."</p> 
                  <p>As the officer spoke, three loud and hearty cheers broke upon the still bay, and on the startled senses of young Seymour. He looked forward. The crew, only a small number of whom had been on the deck till then, were now collected to the number of an hundred, upon the forecastle; and at the words of the officer, had made the welkin ring with their cheers.</p> 
                  <p>Surprised and confounded at the strange words of the officer, and the simultaneous shout of the crew, Seymour turned for an explanation; when, still more to his astonishment, and in the same uniform, stood Almont.</p> 
                  <p>"Really this is quite a farce, and one I do not understand," said he, as he gazed into the face of his friend. The eyes of Almont sparkled with a roguish look, and a significant smile played about his lips.</p> 
                  <p>"What does this mean, Almont?"</p> 
                  <p>"That you are the commander of this vessel and nothing else,"said Mr. Seymour, who at that moment came up. "This vessel is yours; accept it from your father; our little surprise has afforded us much amusement. My son will forgive our well-meant sport."</p> 
               </div> 
               <div type="chapter"> 
                   
                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
                  <p>"AND you knew all this?" said Warren to Almont.</p> 
                  <p>"I did."</p> 
                  <p>"And you?" he asked of Clara, who was now near.</p> 
                  <p>"To be sure, I did," she answered archly.</p> 
                  <p>"But I thought you never kept secrets from me, Clara."</p> 
                  <p>"And never have I, dear Warren, till this one," she said, in a tone as if half reproaching herself for the surprise she herself had proposed and carried out.</p> 
                  <p>"You will grant me one favor, dear Warren?"</p> 
                  <p>"Name it. I will."</p> 
                  <p>"May I give the name to your beautiful vessel?"</p> 
                  <p>"You shall, lovely girl, and as long as I have the command of her, she shall bear the name you give."</p> 
                  <p>Clara handed him a roll of vellum paper. "Within you will find the name I would give," she said, as Warren took the package.</p> 
                  <p>"Thy choice shall be mine," said Warren, as he broke the sealed ends of the roll. A flag of the brightest blue unfolded to his gaze, and the light fabric floated on the breeze.</p> 
                  <p>"A flying arrow!" said Warren, as the device met his eye. "A more beautiful or appropriate device you could not have chosen, dear Clara; you have named my vessel the-FLYING ARROW."</p> 
                  <p>Seymour affixed the beautiful flag to the ensign halyard, and in a moment it was flying at the "main" of the schooner, and for the first time waved over the deck of the privateer.</p> 
                  <p>We will, in a few words, explain to the reader what, to Seymour, appeared more like a dream than aught else.</p> 
                  <p>A short time before he fell sick, his father, calculating from the position of affairs, and confident in his own mind that a war was inevitable, determined to purchase or have built, a small substantial vessel, intending to present it to his son, whom he had often heard express a desire to be master of a craft of his own. He accordingly engaged the services of Mr. Wildon, who had been an experienced ship-master and<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6021-00000011"/> builder, to purchase or superintend the building of a schooner of about two hundred tons, suitable for privateering. In a short time, a "Baltimore Clipper" of the first class was built under the direction of Mr. Wildon; and ere Warren had recovered from his sickness, was anchored in Boston Bay. At the suggestion of Clara Wildon. who had been made acquainted with the purpose of Mr. Seymour, Warren was kept in ignorance of the whole affair, to make his surprise the more complete.</p> 
                  <p>Ere the perfect recovery of her lover, Clara Wildon had embroidered the beautiful flag, from the device of which the beautiful vessel took its name. To young Almont, Mr. Seymour had first disclosed his intention; and several weeks ere Warren stepped on board of his own vessel, Almont had engaged a crew of a hundred young and as daring fellows as ever sailed the sea.</p> 
                  <p>It was after their return home that the whole was explained to Warren; and one week from that time he had taken leave, in high spirits, of his many friends, among the hundreds of spectators that had assembled upon the pier, to witness the departure of the Flying Arrow.</p> 
                  <p>To the lovely, weeping Clara he had spoken the last farewell; he had taken the last fond look of the fair being whom he loved beside all on earth. He turned from her, and descended to the boat that was to take her commander to the deck of the beautiful vessel that lay anchored beyond, when a deep voice, in a hoarse, low whisper sounded in his ears words of strange meaning. "The hawk is on the wing; let the timid dove beware its stoop." He turned, but he who uttered the strange words was gone,-naught met his penetrating gaze but the smile of friends. The boat shot rapidly from the wharf as he waved his last adieu, and in half an hour, the Flying Arrow was flying rapidly before the stiff northwester to the ocean beyond.</p> 
                  <p>The description of the privateer and her crew, and the departure of the beautiful vessel was more fully described in the opening chapter of our story.</p> 
                  <p>In the splendid cabin of the schooner sat Seymour, his elbow resting upon a beautiful marble slab before him, his hand supporting his brow, while his face was expressive of the deepest and most intense thought. His eyes were fixed with a steady yet vacant gaze upon the carpeted floor of the cabin, as if spel-lbound and riveted in their sockets. Thus had he sat since his first entrance, and had not moved. At length, his deep and silent thoughts seemed to give way before the utterance of speech; and in a slow and deeply thoughtful tone he spoke.</p> 
                  <p>"Those words-those words-what could they have meant? What can they forebode? Evil? Heaven grant not. Yet, they were wild and terribly spoken; and thrilled the blood to my very heart. And that voice,-never did I hear so terrible a one. Yes,-once;-once I heard a voice as deep and terrible. 'Twas my brother's when he swore his last fearful oath of revenge: the last words I heard him speak. It must be he;-none but he could have uttered those terrible words-'twas he-my brother-nay, it cannot be-he is dead-dead! Might not this have been some false tale? May he not now live? Yet for what object his death was made known, I know not."</p> 
                  <p>For a few moments he again seemed lost in thought; then repeated the mysterious words; "The hawk is on the wing; let the timid dove beware its stoop."</p> 
                  <p>"The hawk-who should he be but my brother. The dove-who but my loved Clara. But heaven! the sentence hath more meaning than the words betray. If for a moment I thought harm were threatened her, the Flying Arrow should retrace the distance she has run. Yet it cannot be-mortal could not have uttered those words, or he could not have escaped me. If it were a fiend, she is as safe while I am on the sea, as if I were beside her. Yet, those words-I heard them as plainly as I do my own. And that voice,-it was my brother's, or I never heard him speak."</p> 
                  <p>With this he started to his feet.-Almont stood before him.</p> 
                  <p>It will be remembered in the first chapter, that he had been requested by Seymour to come to his cabin as soon as the vessel was well on her way. Seymour, so deeply engaged in thought, had not noticed his entrance; and Almont, surprised at the unusual thoughtful manner of his friend, had listened in silence to his strange words.</p> 
                  <p>"Almont, I knew not when you entered. How long have you been here?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ten minutes."</p> 
                  <p>"You have then heard from me, what I heard from my brother."</p> 
                  <p>"Your brother! I heard you speak of him, but knew not your meaning."</p> 
                  <p>"Almont, we believed' him dead. He is not dead, but lives!"</p> 
                  <p>"Impossible! Warren, the excitement of the past week has wrought upon thy mind; and I fear a relapse of those terrible spells of absence, if you give way to thoughts like these. Discard them entirely. Depend upon it, Warren, it was imagination that forced itself upon your mind."</p> 
                  <p>"It might be; I will believe it was," said Seymour, as if relieved by his friend's words. "It was imagination."</p> 
                  <p>Almont, however much inclined to believe what Seymour heard was real, and came from mortal lips, he nevertheless dispelled the idea from the mind of his friend; and ere they returned on deck, Seymour's thoughts were on naught but his beautiful vessel. The city of the Three Hills was fast disappearing as the two friends gazed from the bulwarks of the schooner, and ere a long time, the naked eye could not discern it. On and on glided the privateer; on, like a winged arrow she shot through the foam-lashed waves of the ocean; while upon her decks fell the snow-white spray like showers of silver rain, glistening in the flashing rays of the sun, with all the hues of the rainbow.</p> 
                  <p>"By heaven! I had never dreamed of speed like this!" exclaimed Almont, gazing at the sparkling foam which seemed boiling around the bows of the vessel.</p> 
                  <p>"Light and free must be the craft, and with speed like the wind, to keep in the wake of this witch of the waves," again spoke he in admiration of the bird-like velocity with which the privateer skimmed the waves.</p> 
                  <p>"There is one upon the seas which has never had match. Heaven grant I may cross her track," said Seymour, thoughtfully.</p> 
                  <p>"What is her name?" inquired Almont.</p> 
                  <p>"The Black Vulture."</p> 
                  <p>"The Devil's Own! By heaven, she well deserves her name if she can outstrip the Flying Arrow. But from the commencement of the war she has not been heard of or seen upon the Atlantic. She has chosen another field for her demon career, or else she's no more."</p> 
                  <p>"I pray heaven she's beneath the waves. But if she floats may it be my fortune one day to meet her."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
                  <p>A YEAR passed-the war yet raged.</p> 
                  <p>Of the many American privateers that roamed the waters of the Atlantic, none had gained such celebrity as the Flying Arrow; both on account of her successful capture of many richly laden prizes, and more especially the matchless speed of the privateer. Everywhere had her name and fame spread on this side of the Atlantic; and on the other, it was told that the fastest sailer on the deep was an American privateer called the Flying Arrow. Never, since the day of her sailing, had she found her match in speed. Never had a chase escaped her. Often was she cursed by the British sailor. Cursed for her matchless speed, for her extraordinary success. Yet her career was not marked by dark sanguinary deeds of bloodshed, like many of the privateers that ploughed the ocean, themselves little better than lawless pirates.</p> 
                  <p>We would now transfer our readers to the deck of the Flying Arrow, which, for eight-and-forty hours, had lain becalmed, about fifty miles outside the Bermudas. It was noon-the calm, unruffled ocean, without the slightest ripple, lay like a golden mirror beneath the dazzling and powerful rays of the noonday sun, reflecting his radiant splendor like an immense laver of burnished gold. Not a breath of wind had been felt, nor the slightest cloud seen since she was first becalmed. Yet, within a few hours, in the south and west the sky had assumed a dull and hazy appearance, momentarily increasing to a darker and more threatening hue, and appearances in that quarter were indicative of an approaching storm.</p> 
                  <p>"By the Lord! three hours more will not find us here," exclaimed young Almont, who had been for some time watching the horizon in breathless silence.</p> 
                  <p>"We shall soon have wind, and enough of it, or I'm mistaken," and even as he spoke, a light puff of wind stirred the locks on his brow. Another, and another, succeeded at intervals, till a light, steady breeze had sprung up, cool and refreshing to the heated brow.</p> 
                  <p>A short time, and the smooth, glassy, mirror like surface of the waters was ruffled by the light wind, and the sparkling ripples now played over the whole vast expanse of ocean.</p> 
                   
                  <p>The greater part of the crew of the privateer were at this time reposing beneath an extensive awning upon the forecastle, little dreaming of being disturbed, when the shrill whistle of the boatswain started the loungers to their feet; the next moment came the order:</p> 
                  <p>"All hands make sail."</p> 
                  <p>The order was quickly obeyed by the surprised crew, and hardly any time elapsed ere the Flying Arrow felt the influence of the breeze. Slowly, and almost imperceptibly at first, she glided from her watery bed, each moment increasing her speed till she flew with her acoustomed rapidity over the snow-capped waves.</p> 
                  <p>The gentle breeze, so scarcely perceptible at first, within the hour had ripened to a gale, and lashed the mighty ocean with a whitened sheet of foam. With almost fearful speed the privateer bounded over the snowy-crested waves, her slender topmasts bending like reeds before the furious blasts of the powerful gale. On, and on, with lightning-like velocity, bounded the gallant vessel as if she spurned the very waves beneath her, and ere nightfall was many miles from where she had been becalmed, and pressing on with unabated speed over the trackless deep.</p> 
                  <p>The sun was fast sinking towards the foaming ocean, over which it cast a broad glare of golden radiance, when there came a cry from the lookout, of "Sail ho!"</p> 
                  <p>"Where away?" shouted Seymour.</p> 
                  <p>"Right on our lee," was the answer.</p> 
                  <p>All eyes were now directed in that quarter, and in the distance was faintly discovered a sail, but so distant that it could not be made out.</p> 
                  <p>Seymour sprang into the rigging and levelled the glass at the distant sail. It was some time ere he, with glass, was able to make out the stranger. When satisfied as to what she was, he gave the glass to young Almont.</p> 
                  <p>"See what you make of her," he said, as the young man levelled the glass at the strange craft.</p> 
                  <p>"An English corvette of twenty guns," said the young man. "There goes her colors, the cross of St. George, at her peak."</p> 
                  <p>"And an invitation to show ours," he said, as a bright jet of flame burst from the bows of the ship.</p> 
                  <p>"Show them the gridiron at the fore, and ours at the main," said Seymour quickly, as the report of a gun came to his ear.</p> 
                  <p>The stars and the stripes, and the beautiful flag of the privateer were bent to the ensign halyards, and in a moment fluttered aloft at the mast head. In a short time, the English cruiser was in fair sight, and as Almont had said, mounted about twenty guns, and her course bearing the same as the privateer.</p> 
                  <p>The two vessels, sailing, on an angle, were rapidly converging to a point, each moment lessening the distance between them. They had kept on their course exactly opposite each other for half an hour, neither gaining any apparent advantage, when the privateer was observed to be gaining on her adversary, and ere the hour expired, shot directly across the bows of the Englishman, full one mile to windward.</p> 
                  <p>"They'll not let us pass without a shot?" said Almont, who had scarcely averted his gaze from the Englishman since he had first seen her, to Seymour who was standing near him.</p> 
                  <p>Before he could reply, a bright jet of flame issued from the bows of the cruiser, and a column of light blue smoke rolled most beautifully upward. A second, and the report of the gun was heard, and some distance astern flew its iron messenger like lightning over the water, one moment several feet above it, then dashing into the wave, would scatter the glittering spray high in the air, reflecting as it fell, the brightest sunlight, like drops of golden rain. Thus alternately disappearing, the globe of iron at length sunk in the waves half a mile to windward of the privateer. Another flash, and another ball went whizzing over the waves, and ere it sunk, a third report was heard and the ball skimming over the waves fell as wide off the intended mark as its predecessor.</p> 
                  <p>Seymour laughed as the third unsuccessful shot was fired, and in a loud tone ordered the schooner to be hove to, and the long Tom to be cleared away for action. In a short time<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6021-00000013"/> the ponderous instrument of destruction, old Thunderbolt, was cleared and ready for immediate use.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, Bob, send then your card; show the Englishman what you can do in the way of making an impression," said Seymour to a short, stout, burly looking individual with a sparkling eye and jovial countenance, which looked as though 'twas never troubled with care, or beset with aught but good humor.</p> 
                  <p>This individual was about five and twenty years of age, of extreme low stature, and among the crew invariably went by the cognomen of "Bob Short." He was possessed of great strength, of which he was proudly conscious, but prided himself the more on being the best gunner and the most skilful shot on the waters. To this pride he had a right, for there were none who could excel, and but few who could equal his accurate aim. Beside the huge gun, with a lighted match in his hand, stood Bob.</p> 
                  <p>"Already?" he inquired.</p> 
                  <p>"Already!" was the response of the seaman who directed the movements of the gun.</p> 
                  <p>For a moment Bob let his eye range along the sight of the piece.</p> 
                  <p>"Up a little," said he quickly.</p> 
                  <p>"Up it is," responded the seaman, elevating the sight of the piece.</p> 
                  <p>"A very little to the left," said Bob.</p> 
                  <p>"To the left it is."</p> 
                  <p>"Steady, now."</p> 
                  <p>"Steady 'tis," was the response.</p> 
                  <p>Bob ran his eye again along the sight of the gun, then with a look at the cruiser, said-</p> 
                  <p>"I'll down with that Englishman's jib in the wink of an eye. Blow me tight if I don't spoil her sailing qualities for an hour. Here's my best respects."</p> 
                  <p>Whirling the match in the air several times, he was about to fire, when a ball flew over the decks of the schooner within twelve inches of the mainmast forward.</p> 
                  <p>"By heaven! they begin to find their mark," said Almont, as he heard the whizzing of the ball as it cut through the air.</p> 
                  <p>"And I'll find mine," said Bob with a laugh.</p> 
                  <p>The lighted match touched the powder.-The privateer trembled to the very keel at the discharge of the heavy gun. A cloud of thick smoke enveloped the decks of the schooner, and the missile of death and destruction sped on its message. The wind cleared the decks of the smoke, and the Englishman was seen standing on under full sail, unharmed.</p> 
                  <p>For once the invincible Bob was foiled, for once, he had missed his aim. A low, suppressed murmur of disappointment came from the crew of the schooner; but soon it was changed. The corvette which for a moment stood on apparently unharmed by the discharge of the Long Tom, of a sudden, slackened her speed. Her foremast seemed unsteady and wavering in its place;-it swayed-tottered-and in an instant fell forward upon the bowsprit with a crash that was plainly heard on board the schooner; carrying in its fall, the flying jibboom, sails, rigging, and all-all was one complete wreek.</p> 
                  <p>On the instant, there burst from the crew as they beheld the destruction which Bob had caused with his single shot, three loud and deafening cheers, which were borne to the ears of their foes upon the breeze.</p> 
                  <p>"Three shouts more for Bob, the matchless," exclaimed one of the crew, as the first three died away.</p> 
                  <p>In the instant, three cheers more rang out upon the air, in compliment to Bob.</p> 
                  <p>"Now," said Seymour, as all again became silent, "Three more for Boston."</p> 
                  <p>Again the united shout swelled long and loud upon the air; and filling away with a flowing sheet, the privateer was soon again bowling merrily over the waves upon her course; leaving the disabled corvette to make the best of her wrecked situation; ere the sun had wholly veiled its light, the Englishman was lost in the distance.</p> 
                  <p>It was now the intention of Seymour to proceed immediately to Boston, whither we will precede the Flying Arrow.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
                  <p>IT was on a lovely evening several days subsequent to the scene in the last chapter that a long, low, not black, but a beautiful bright green-sided schooner, an American privateer, was seen in the inner harbor, standing in for the city. She was a topsail schooner of about two hundred tons, and carried an enormous spread of sail which a vessel of any less breadth of beam would have capsized under. She sailed like a witch; not the inmates of the sea could cleave the waves faster than did the schooner.</p> 
                  <p>Upon the wharves were hundreds of spectators watching the privateer; for she had announced her arrival with her guns; and was now within half a mile of the city. Among the spectators upon one of the piers, was Mr. Seymour and Mr. Wildon and his daughter, who had repaired hither, as they had done several times before, when the arrival of any vessel was announced, in the hope that it would prove to be the Flying Arrow. And it was rumored on this evening that the approaching vessel was the one they ardently wished it to be.</p> 
                  <p>"I hope we shall not be again disappointed," said Clara, as the approaching stranger began to appear plainly in view. "I pray Heaven this may be the Flying Arrow."</p> 
                  <p>"I also hope this may be my son's vessel," said Mr. Seymour. "But see! her hull is painted green. It cannot be his," he said, as the vessel, wearing on her course, revealed her green sides.</p> 
                  <p>"We shall have to bear with another disappointment," said Mr. Wildon with a glance at the schooner. "My word for't, that's not the Flying Arrow."</p> 
                  <p>A shadow rested on the face of Clara for an instant, but, as if under the impulse of some new hope, it quickly vanished.</p> 
                  <p>"Yet for all this, dear father," she said looking into his face, "It may be the Flying Arrow. Warren may have altered the color of his vessel. You know his taste was not consulted in any one thing about the schooner.-Painted black as she was, she might have bore-as she did in my eye-too strong a resemblance to a pirate, to suit his fancy."</p> 
                  <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6021-00000014"/> 
                  <p>"It may be, we shall soon see," said her father, appearing to coincide with her ideas. "He may, as you say, have altered the color of her hull. And by my faith, I hope 'twill prove to be his gallant craft."</p> 
                  <p>Swiftly onward came the privateer, leaving behind a foaming wake, and her wide distended sails gilded by the last rays of the setting sun. A beautiful craft. At her peak waved the stars and stripes, but she showed no flag or signal by which her name could be learned. The sun had been some moments down when she came to anchor in the stream. The clouds which had imbued the gorgeous hues of sunset, still retained their tinted glories, and were reflected below, in the waters of the Bay. As the schooner came to anchor, a flag had been run up to the foremast head, on which her name was displayed, "The Rambler."</p> 
                  <p>Motionless upon the waves she now laid, over which, but a few moments before, she bounded with the speed of the wind. Her all raking masts, long, tapering bowsprit and finely moulded hull, were all mirrored in the depths below. On the quarter deck, with an easy, careless gait, paced a young man richly dressed in a naval uniform. Yet, on his face, a reckless and devil-may care expression ever rested and a continual smile on his lips. His carriage was easy and indifferent, his air independent, and the blue cap, with band of gold on his head, set saucily one side, set off his appearance to a charm. In his hand he carried a long slender sword which he twirled rapidly in the air with his fingers, as if merely to kill time. This young man was the Privateer captain. Suddenly he stopped in his promenade, and sheathing his sword in the rich scabbard that hung suspended from a shining black belt round his waist, he said:</p> 
                  <p>"Lower away the cutter!" in a tone so careless that it seemed to imply that if the order was not obeyed it was all the same to him.</p> 
                  <p>"Cutter's away," said the boatswain.</p> 
                  <p>And in a moment the captain's gig was lowered alongside, and the young man having first placed in his mouth a lighted cigar (for in those days, it was no violation of the law to smoke), he seated himself lazily in the stern-sheets, and the boat shot towards a pier to which he had pointed.</p> 
                  <p>Clara, her father, and Mr. Seymour, once more disappointed, were about leaving for their homes when the boat from the schooner touched at the very pier on which they stood, and the young officer ascended; and with several young men, one of whom bowed to Mr. Seymour, passed up the wharf. They had passed some distance up when they stopped, and the young man who had bowed to Mr. Seymour, together with the young officer, turned and walked rapidly back.</p> 
                  <p>"You will see this young privateersman face to face now," said Mr. Wildon to Clara, as the young officer and his friend neared them. To the surprise of Mr. Wildon and his daughter, the young man in company with the officer accosted Mr. Seymour, with whom he was acquainted.</p> 
                  <p>"I beg leave, Mr. Seymour," said he "to present to you my friend, Mr. George Fitz Alwyn, commander of yonder schooner. He was acquainted with your sons and but now inquired for you, as he has letters from Warren."</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Seymour cordially shook the hand of Fitz Alwyn, and presented him and the other young man to Mr. Wildon and his daughter. Clara blushed somewhat as Fitz Alwyn saluted her. Taking her hand within his he pressed it to his lips. "Forgive me, Miss Wildon, if I am rude," said the young privateersman. "But 'tis the fashion with us sailors, and a liberty we claim," he said, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"O, I forgive, on condition that you take no more such liberties," said Clara, archly,; at the same time withdrawing her hand from his.</p> 
                  <p>Fitz Alwyn now turned to Mr. Seymour and said, "I have to fulfil a promise made to your son, and deliver you a package entrusted to me by him. He was well when last I saw him, and hopes soon to be with you."</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Seymour received the package enclosed in the envelope, heartily thanking the young man for his kindness.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Those letters," said Fitz Alwyn, "will tell you who I am, and when next we meet we shall be better acquainted."</p> 
                  <p>Having first promised Mr. Seymour that he would call the next evening at his house, Fitz Alwyn took the arm of his friend, and bowing to the three, left them to join the young men in waiting.</p> 
                  <p>The package contained three letters, one each to Mr. Seymour and Mr. Wildon, and the other to Clara, his daughter.</p> 
                  <p>The two former were letters of introduction, and Warren in one to his father, said-</p> 
                  <q>
                     <p>"DEAR FATHER: The young man I introduce to your notice is George Fitz Alwyn, commander of the American privateer schooner, Rambler, and as fine a fellow as ever trod a vessel's decks. But for him and his gallant vessel, I and mine would have been beneath the waves. In a short time I hope to see you, and you shall know all. My friend you will receive as a son, as you would me. Remember that to him I attribute the saving of my gallant vessel, and the lives of my crew. Till I see you, farewell."</p>
                  </q> 
                  <p>That which Clara received was a brief, passionate epistle, every line breathing a spirit of unalloyed devotion and love; closing by recommending to her notice, his friend Fitz Alwyn, to whom he had awarded the highest praise as a brave and daring young officer, to whom he should ever feel bound by the deepest gratitude.</p> 
                  <p>"But for him, dear Clara," he said, "the hope that I now enjoy, that of soon clasping thee to my bosom, would not now have lived within me. But for him, one who loves you with a heart's truest devotion-myself, would not now have penned these lines. Till a short time, dearest, farewell."</p> 
                  <p>These letters coming from the one they did, were likely to kindle in the breasts of those who received them, an ardent attachment to the friend of Warren, and insured to him a cordial and heart welcome reception.</p> 
                  <p>As he had promised, Fitz Alwyn the next evening proceeded to the residence of Mr. Seymour, where had arrived before him, Mr. Wildon and his daughter. He was received in a kindly and courteous manner, and the evening passed off pleasantly to him; enlivened by the presence of Clara, the hours wore rapidly away. At a late hour, Fitz Alwyn promising another visit, departed.</p> 
                  <p>It was on his fourth visit to the house of Mr. Seymour, as he was about to depart, that he said, "I have to say this is my last visit. On the day after to-morrow, I sail from here. I have invited on the morrow, a number of friends and acquaintances on board the Rambler for a pleasure sail outside the harbor. It is my wish that you and your friend, Mr. Wildon, be of the company."</p> 
                  <p>"And you, Miss Wildon," he said respectfully, "you must not fail to honor us with your presence, as there are to be several young ladies on board. My vessel, crew and myself I place at the service of my friends, and every thing in my power shall be done to make the sail a pleasant one. I shall expect you all."</p> 
                  <p>The invitation of the young officer so politely extended, was accepted with pleasure by the two gentlemen, and Clara also promised to accompany her father.</p> 
                  <p>Gallantly imprinting a kiss upon the hand of the fair Clara, Fitz Alwyn took his leave.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
                  <p>AN hour past noon on the following day, the Privateer schooner Rambler, with a merry party on board, weighed anchor and dropped down the bay. She skimmed over the sparkling waves, swiftly passing the many green islands within the bay, till she launched upon the blue waters of the Atlantic. The party on board were highly pleased with the beautiful vessel, and finely enjoyed their sail, and a few never on ship-board before, were astonished at the speed of the privateer. The hours wore merrily off with the party; the excursion proving highly gratifying to all. It was when the land grew dim in the distance behind them that a few, more timed than the rest, began to show signs of impatience and apprehension from being so far at sea; and expressed a desire to return. But their wishes were disappointed. The schooner still flew rapidly away on her course out to sea. They were destined never to behold the city in the vessel that had borne them from it. She had left her moorings in the stream never to return.</p> 
                  <p>Fitz Alwyn, who had been during the greater part of the afternoon in company with Clara Wildon, had left her in charge of her father, and now stood by himself upon the forecastle. The care-for-nothing expression that his face usually wore, had given way to a thoughtful, troubled look. He had stood some time in a thoughtful mood, when he spoke in a strange manner.</p> 
                  <p>"By heaven! it is too foul. She is too good, too pure to be the victim of this hellish plot, of which I am the base and willing agent. Would to God this heart had stopped its beating; these hands have withered, ere I had lent them to this foul play. Would that I had thought, ere it was too late."</p> 
                  <p>"By heaven! it shall not be," he said in a low, fierce tone. "She shall never be his victim. I will save her even now. The schooner shall instantly be put about and run for the city. If I fail in this, may God save her from harm. I am too late. She's lost."</p> 
                  <p>As he spoke a shrill whistle was heard, and in an instant a score of men, armed with out lasses rushed from below the deck, and immediately ately fell upon the crew who had charge of the vessel, making them in one moment prisoners.</p> 
                  <p>"This foul play has begun and I must now act my part," said Fitz Alwyn, drawing his sword. "Treacherous villains! what means all this? By the Lord, what means this mutiny?" he demanded of the mutineers, springing at the same time into their midst.</p> 
                  <p>He received no answer. His sword was struck from his hand, and in an instant he was himself a prisoner.</p> 
                  <p>This sudden and unexpected mutiny struck them with alarm and apprehension for their own safety, momentarily expecting to be bound themselves as prisoners, by the reckless looking desperadoes who now had the charge of the schooner. The ladies screamed with fear and clung to their fathers, brothers or lovers for protection, dreading lest they should become the victims of the mutineers. But their fears proved groundless.</p> 
                  <p>As Fitz Alwyn was bound, a gun was fired and a small schooner which had for some time been in sight, was brought too, and in a few minutes lay alongside of the privateer. To the inexpressible joy and relief of the terrified females, the whole party were instantly ordered to leave the schooner; which order they prepared to obey with no little pleasure.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Wildon and daughter, among the last, were about to leave the vessel when a hand was placed rudely upon the shoulder of Clara, and a voice said, "Stay, lady, you must not depart."</p> 
                  <p>She screamed with fear, and shrunk from the savage looking ruffian beside her, who kept a tight grasp upon her shoulder.</p> 
                  <p>"Take off thy hand, man or devil," exclaimed Mr. Wildon, fiercely; dashing aside from his daughter the hand of the ruffian.</p> 
                  <p>"What means this outrage? what would you of her?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"That she remain," said the other, in a deep, determined tone, again laying his hand upon her.</p> 
                  <p>With the fury of a wounded tiger, Mr. Wildon sprang upon him and both fell to the deck.</p> 
                  <p>And that instant Clara was seized in the grasp of two strong men and borne across the deck.</p> 
                  <p>"O God! my father!" shrieked the terrified maiden as she beheld him struggling in the iron grasp of several men, about to thrust him over the side of the privateer.</p> 
                  <p>One piercing cry of agony, and the lifeless form of Clara Wildon was borne below by the two miscreants.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Wildon had been thrust roughly over the side of the privateer into the smaller schooner, and in an instant springing upon the bulwarks, he said in a frenzied tone, pointing to where Fitz Alwyn lay, "Tell me, has yonder man ought to do with this foul outrage? Knew he of it?"</p> 
                  <p>"He has had nought to do with it?" answered the leader of the mutineers. "He is my prisoner, you see."</p> 
                  <p>"'This false as hell!" cried Fitz Alwyn, raising himself, bound as he was, to a sitting posture. "I was the sole-</p> 
                  <p>But ere he could finish he was gagged, and carried from the deck.</p> 
                  <p>"This is some damnable treachery and foul crime," said Mr. Wildon as he heard the words of Fitz Alwyn.</p> 
                  <p>"May the curse of God forever rest on him who was its author."</p> 
                  <p>"O God," he cried in agony, "My daughter! my daughter! Fiends! give back my child, and I will give ye wealth; all that I possess. But in the name of God, restore my child," and the distracted father wrung his hands in despair. His frantic appeal was of no avail. A loud, mocking laugh was all that was returned. The next moment the two vessels parted.</p> 
                  <p>Overcome by his feelings, Mr. Wildon burying his face in his hands, threw himself upon the deck, exclaiming in a voice of anguish;</p> 
                  <p>"O God! my child, my child! why was she torn from me? why am I robbed of her?-O may she die, ere dishonor threaten her. My child, my Clara. I am now indeed alone."</p> 
                  <p>And the unhappy parent gave way to inconsolable and poignant grief. He was raised<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6021-00000016"/> from the deck by Mr. Seymour, who with words of solace and consolation strove to lessen the sorrow of his friend, but with no effect, the grief of the father was overwhelming, and which time only could soften. The two vessels had been separated about a quarter of an hour, when the report of a gun was heard by those on board the smaller schooner, and almost at the same time an affrighted voice exclaimed, "In the name of God, look there! A Pirate! The Black Vulture!"</p> 
                  <p>These terrible words thrilled with horror all on board, and every eye was fixed upon the other vessel.</p> 
                  <p>But where was the green-sided privateer? She was gone! and in her place was the low, black hull of a pirate schooner seen. At her peak floated her flag, the terror of the Atlantic. It was a broad field of white, on which was represented:</p> 
                  <p>On a rock 'mid the waves of the ocean, with wings extended, stood a Black Vulture. In its talons were clutched the flags of several nations; the most conspicuous among them was the stars and stripes, tattered and torn. In its beak was a long slender staff, from which floated the black flag with the grinning death's head and cross bones. While the flags of several nations were trampled upon the rock, the black flag waved above them.</p> 
                  <p>Such was the flag of the Black Vulture. It waved aloft but a few moments, when it was hauled down and gave place to the stars and stripes: at that moment as by magic, the black hull gave place to the green one. All sail was crowded upon the schooner, as if danger was even now to be feared from the pirate, and the distance was rapidly widening between them. Mingled emotions of fear and joy prevailed in the hearts of those on board. All shuddered as the thought of the hours spent in the terrible corsair came to their minds; and all felt a joy at their escape and deliverance. But their happiness was clouded by the unbounded sorrow of Mr. Wildon, who would receive no consolation whatever.</p> 
                  <p>"My child, my daughter in the hands of pirates! O horrible! To be a pirate's-O God!" I shall be mad!" was his passionate exclamation; heightened by the poignancy of his grief.</p> 
                  <p>Several hours elapsed, and the schooner lay alongside one of the piers of the city; the party had sought their homes.</p> 
                  <p>Two mornings afterward an American privateer was discovered anchored in the stream. It was the Flying Arrow, she had arrived the night previous. At sunrise she announced her presence with the cannon, and thousands, in a short space of time, had flocked to the piers to learn the cause of the firing. Cheers upon cheers swelled upon the air as the multitude learned the arrival of the far famed privateer, the Flying Arrow.</p> 
                  <p>In a short time a boat was lowered over the side and manned; and in a moment more, two officers descended. One, Warren Seymour the commander, the other Albert Almont the lieutenant of the privateer. The boat shot rapidly towards India Pier where it soon arrived, and the officers landed amid the cheers of thousands. Two hours afterward the boat was alongside of the schooner, when Seymour, Almont, and Mr. Wildon came on board. All three wore looks of sorrow. Warren had learned the arrival of the disguised pirate-of the villany of Fitz Alwyn. He had read the forged letters of introduction by which Fitz Alwyn had consummated his hellish plans.-He had learned of the pretended pleasure sail. Of the treachery; and of the outrage. He had heard all the dreadful truth from the lips of Mr. Wildon.</p> 
                  <p>As he stepped upon the deck his feelings overpowered him, and he exclaimed in a voice of heartfelt anguish, "O God! she whom I hoped to have clasped ere now to this beating bosom;-is gone-is far away-torn from her very home by a-pirate-and perhaps ere now, sacrificed to the desires of the pirate horde.-O God! the thought is madness-despair!"</p> 
                  <p>His strange words surprised the crew who had heard enough to interpret the dreadful meaning; and every heart beat with sympathy for their young commander. Young Almont now related to them the whole affair, and Seymour, recovering from his agitation, spoke. "Brave friends!" said he, "you have heard from Almont all that I can tell. You have learned that the Black Vulture is yet afloat. She has been here.-My men, this cruise is now up; I have no claims upon you-you are at liberty to go whither you will. But listen. I must have a crew. Twelve hours must not pass ere the Flying Arrow stands out to sea. Many of you are now within the very sight of your homes, from which it would be hard so soon to part. I shall cruise six months in search of this pirate; and if, in that time I fall not in with him, I return. Mark me, if I fall in with him, I shall fight him at all hazards. I will sink the pirate or the privateer, I pledge myself to give each man a year's prize money, who shall accompany me on this cruise. My friends, you have heard me. Shall the Flying Arrow, as the avenger, follow in the wake of the Black Vulture, or shall she remain, and retribution be delayed?"</p> 
                  <p>"Retribution!" was the deep and firm response of the crew, and simultaneous as if it came from the lips of one man. The next moment, three cheers for the Flying Arrow rang out upon the air.</p> 
                  <p>"Remember," said Seymour, "some of you may never return. If we fall in with this pirate, some of us must die. Now all who ship this cruise will stand on the starboard side; all who do not, on the larboard."</p> 
                  <p>One moment and not one remained on the larboard side of the schooner. Seymour had not dreamed so unanimous a spirit prevailed among his crew as was manifested, and their determination gratified him to the utmost.</p> 
                  <p>"You will each and all have three hours leave; at the end of the fourth, the Flying Arrow must be outside the harbor." A 'loud and prolonged cheer followed these words, and in a moment all the boats were lowered and filled. In a short time the crew, with the exception of several who remained on board, were landed ashore.</p> 
                  <p>Half an hour before the expiration of the time allotted the crew on shore, a boat was seen standing towards the privateer, and in a few minutes lay alongside. It contained a single individual, who having made the boat fast, sprang upon the deck of the schooner. He was a young man of fair and pleasing look, but a shade of melancholy rested upon his features, and deep seated sorrow was stamped on his fine open brow. The sad expression of his face struck the beholder with sympathy. He advanced towards Almont who was standing alone upon the quarter-deck, and said in a bold tone, yet marked with sadness, "I would speak with the commander of this vessel."</p> 
                  <p>"He is below: I will conduct you to him," said Almont, with courtesy, and inviting the stranger to follow him, both descended to the cabin.</p> 
                  <p>Before the three hours had expired, the whole of the crew to a man were on board, and ere the sun had crossed the meridian the Flying Arrow had spread her canvass to the breeze, and was skimming the waves of the Atlantic.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE SCOURGE OF THE ATLANTIC.</head> 
                  <p>THE setting sun had lined the western horizon with the brilliant and beautiful colors of the rainbow. The deep, fiery red that stretched far away towards the north and south, gradually lost its brilliancy in a lighter and softer red, which blended beautifully with the tinted hues of purple. The rich purple faded almost imperceptibly into the lightest green, which stretching far upward was lost in the blue atmosphere above.</p> 
                  <p>The last rays of the sun fell with splendor upon the gorgeous banner of Spain, as it floated from a lofty flag staff upon the frowning walls of the castle Moro, which guards the entrance to the harbor of Havana. Within the offing the eye rested upon a number of vessels becalmed upon the motionless waters; their snow-white sails gilded by the sun, and mirrored in the golden depths below. It was a picturesque and lovely sight. The day king had sunk in his fiery bed; yet the calm, unruffled ocean, with its islands of green, were glowing with the lavish beauties of a West Indian sunset.-Beautiful as are the evenings in these climes, this was a paragon. At length the greyer shades of evening began slowly to usurp the rich glories of twilight. The stars began to appear from their high homes, and brightly twinkling, were reflected in the calm, clear depth of the ocean, which had now lost its robe of brilliancy. Darkness was fast spreading in the west but the deepening shade was soon to be dispelled. An hour before the fiery king of day had sunk in the western waters, the round full moon, the beauteous queen of night, had risen from the east, and had already pierced

                      night's mantle of darkness, with her beams of silvery light, which fell glistening upon the ocean. Upward and upward through the starry realms of heaven, rose the beauteous orb, casting broad over earth and ocean its mantle of silvery light. Onward and onward, in regal splendor, sailed the queen of night, flooding all below with her silvery radiance, and paling with her resplendent car, the stars, "those lesser lights of heaven," till they burned dim, and shone but faintly in the realms above.</p> 
                  <p>On sailed the moon, till she seemed suspended, like a gigantic lamp of glaring flame, in the very centre of the arching, azure canopy of heaven; when suddenly in the west appeared a faint, red flash of light, deepening every moment to a redder and more fiery hue, as if the sun, bright god of day, jealous of the rival orb of light, was rising with redoubled splendor from the portals of the west. Deeper and deeper grew the crimson hue, in the horizon, casting upon the broad ocean the reddening glare; suddenly two spires of brilliant flame shot upward, and for a moment blazed with intense brightness, then sunk, extinguished in the waves.</p> 
                  <p>At that instant in the very verge of the horizon could be seen a schooner, whose snowwhite sails, silvered by the moon-beams, were plainly and distinctly relieved against the glowing sky. She was standing towards the south of the island, with an eight knot breeze which had sprung up within an hour upon her larboard quarter. She held her way steadily over the now slightly ruffled waves, and seemed in the distance more like a beauteous fairy bark gliding over a sea of molten silver, than mortal craft upon the ocean.</p> 
                  <p>She was making towards the land in the line of the horizon, and as it seemed was right upon it, when her course was altered, and she sailed for some time alongside the shore, when she suddenly disappeared from view. No eye could behold her. She was no where to be seen. Her disappearance was instantaneous, and as if by magic. The illumination in the west had now entirely faded away, and the moon's effulgent light supplied its place.</p> 
                  <p>At sunrise the next morning Havana was the scene of unusual commotion and excitement, owing to the report of the capture of a Spanish brig, the night previous, by a pirate, and her crew murdered. The feelings of the populace were aroused to the highest state of indignation and alarm, at the atrocious piracy, and every where were vented deep, bitter curses.</p> 
                  <p>The sun was but two hours high when a fast sailing brig of war, then in port, was despatched to cruise off the island, in search of the pirate. At sunset on the fourth day, she returned, without having discovered the object of her search, to the disappointment of hundreds who had watched her depart in the hope that she would return with the pirate as her prize.</p> 
                  <p>Several leagues south of Havana, within an inlet the entrance to which would have defied eyes of mortal to discover, lay a schooner, a long, low, rakish looking craft, of two hundred tons, mounting ten guns, with a long Tom amidships. Her hull was jet black, without the slightest relief; her decks were painted blood red, and the bulwarks inside black. Her topmasts were sent down, and she lay snug and secure from the gaze of man in her hiding place.</p> 
                  <p>The inlet or basin wherein she lay, was hemmed round by dense woods, and the opening from the sea of just sufficient width to admit of her passage, and scarcely discernible from the overhanging bushes on either side, and seemed scarcely of sufficient width to allow the entrance of a common boat. Yet here had passed a vessel of two hundred tons, and lay entirely shut out from observation.</p> 
                  <p>A tall, powerful man, with a visage dark and swarthy, was the only person seen about the schooner, and for half an hour he had been pacing the decks alone. His features were American, but a dark, sinister and forbidding expression rested on his face. He wore a broad brimmed black hat, the brim buttoned up to the crown in front, with a button of silver, exposing a broad brow, furrowed by deep lines, which told of clearly of the darkest passions within. He wore a snow-white shirt, a Spanish<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6021-00000019"/> frilled bosom, in which were several magnificent studs. A pair of flowing trowsers, secured round the waist by a black shining belt, into which were thrust a brace of pistols. Suspended from the belt, on his left side, hung a large dagger or poniard, in the haft of which blazed a jewel of great worth. His hands were small, exceedingly so for one of so large stature, and literally blazed with jewels</p> 
                  <p>"Ha, Gaspard!" he exclaimed, suddenly stopping in his promenade, as the figure of a young man emerged from over the bows of the vessel and sprang lightly upon the deck.</p> 
                  <p>He was a fair and slender youth, of almost feminine features, yet the seal of vice and sensual passions was stamped too plainly upon his fair brow. His dress was precisely the same as his companion's. Beneath his arm he carried a splendid spyglass of exquisite workmanship.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, boy, what hast thou seen? Thou hast tarried long."</p> 
                  <p>"I have good news," replied the youth.-"The brig of-war has returned, and is now anchored in port, within pistol shot of the Moro-I have watched her from yonder steep these two hours."</p> 
                  <p>"Ha! is this so, has she returned?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have spoken truth, she has."</p> 
                  <p>"Then by the lord, we must to sea this very night. I am well nigh tired of this dull life. The moon will rise at ten; an hour before we must be away from this."</p> 
                  <p>Placing a silver whistle to his lips he blew a call; a sharp, rolling sound like the notes of a bird, in that region. This was repeated three times; when suddenly from a rocky steep, before the schooner's bows, and within two feet of the jib-boom, parted a cluster of bushes, a man appeared, who descended by the bow-sprit to the deck of the schooner. A second and third instantly followed; then more, till fifty men were counted. A more ferocious looking set of men were never assembled upon a vessel's deck. Each wore a red shirt, the collar turned over a black handkerchief, which was knotted in front. White pants secured to the waist by a black belt, black slippers, a red woolen cap, and their dress was completed.-Among these dark-browed men, upon the deck of the pirate schooner Defiance, stood William Seymour. As he came on board, the pirate chieftain, the individual first noticed in our description of the schooner, advanced and addressed him.</p> 
                  <p>"Young man, we leave this place to-night, and put out to sea. I offer you the second command of this schooner. I have proposed it to the crew; they will acknowledge you as the same if you accept. I have no more to say. This or the yard-arm will be your choice."-And the pirate chief glanced significantly aloft.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you accept?"</p> 
                  <p>"I do," said Seymour; "the second in command; 'tis but one step to the first," he muttered to himself, while a gleam of fearful ambition lighted his eye.</p> 
                  <p>"Enough; you know your duty," said the chief.</p> 
                  <p>An hour before the moon rose, the schooner was hauled out from the concealed inlet, and with a free wind, stood out to sea.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <p>To the readers of the Rival Brothers, to which this story is a sequel, we, must account for the appearance of William Seymour on board the pirate schooner.</p> 
                  <p>Foiled by his brother, in his foul attempt upon the lovely and virtuous Clara Wildon, for whom he had conceived so violent and unholy a passion, he immediately set out for New York, where he soon arrived. There he learned that he had been disgraced from the navy, and that his name was everywhere coupled with that of assassin. He had stood upon the pier from whence he could view the noble frigate, whose decks he had walked a thousand times, and might have now trod, and a bitter smile passed his lip, and bitter thoughts came to his overburdened mind.</p> 
                  <p>"Disgraced!" he muttered bitterly. "Ay, disgraced forever from the service of yonder flag which floats so proudly aloft, ha! ha!-but here, beneath its folds. I swear eternal enmity against the proud ensign; once the loved, now the hated."</p> 
                  <p>Two days afterward, William Seymour had engaged passage in a Spanish brig, then in port, just ready to sail for Havana.</p> 
                  <p>The next day the brig sailed, having a fair wind. She was a new and beautiful vessel of four hundred tons, and an exceedingly fast sailing craft. Her crew consisted of fourteen men, of whom eight were Englishmen, and the rest Spaniards. Two months previous, she had sailed from Havana, her first voyage and her-last.</p> 
                  <p>It was the forenoon of the sixth day out from New York, that Seymour stood watching the progress of the vessel, and the foaming wreaths ever curling round her bows. He had stood thus an hour, when a sudden and startling thought-to possess himself of the brig, and convert her to his own purposes, flashed through his brain. He had examined every part of her, found she could be easily converted into a formidable armed vessel; which once possessed of, he would roam the waters under the free flag, and bid defiance to all others.It was a daring thought, and it was nourished in the breast of a reckless man.</p> 
                  <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6021-00000020"/> 
                  <p>While contemplating in his mind, how to accomplish the fulfilment of the dark thought, his reverie was suddenly broken by a loud oath from the captain, who, as Seymour turned, struck to the deck one of the crew, a young Spaniard. Seymour beheld the look of terrible hatred, which the young Spaniard as he rose to to his feet, cast at the captain; he knew by the fearful gleam of his dark eye, that blow would be avenged.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll see he does not forget that blow,"muttered Seymour to himself. "If I can read aright, another captain would suit the young Spaniard as well as the present one. At all events, I'll ascertain."</p> 
                  <p>That night Seymour met the Spaniard on his watch, whose words as they parted were:</p> 
                  <p>"I am yours, heart and hand, in this affair, and I pledge my life, my countrymen are yours also."</p> 
                  <p>Seymour found him in the mood he wished; and heard the oaths of revenge the Spaniard swore against the captain, and without fear he unfolded to him his thoughts of capturing the vessel, to which he heartily assented and promised his aid. The second night after, he was informed by Henrique, that the Spaniards, to a man, were gained, and sworn to their purpose.</p> 
                  <p>"It is upon one condition that I now attempt this," said the Spaniard Henrique to Seymour.</p> 
                  <p>"Well."</p> 
                  <p>"It is that I take my own revenge of this English bully, the captain."</p> 
                  <p>"You shall have that pleasure," said Seymour; with this, they parted.</p> 
                  <p>An Englishman, to whom Seymour had made known the plot, had joined the mutineers, who were now eight in number. All was prepared, the plans of the mutineers were laid; but on the eve of their consummation, they were betrayed by the Englishman whom Seymour had trusted. Surprised and overpowered, the mutineers were cast into irons, and the brig held on her way to Havana, where they would be tried and executed as pirates. Once in Havana, their doom was sealed. Seymour resigned himself with a forced unconcern, to the certain doom that he knew awaited him and his companions, but his rage against the Englishman that betrayed him knew no bounds. "Oh! that I were but for one moment free," he exclaimed with fearful passion, "I would pluck his cursed tongue by the roots; and tear his heart reeking from his breast. Ha! ha! this would be a vengeance for which I would sacrifice my soul's salvation."</p> 
                  <p>The brig was within a day's sail of Havana, when a schooner was seen bearing down upon her. She was a suspicious looking craft, and her manuvres created no little alarm on board the brig. It was now morning; the brig held on her way till noon, crowding all sail, and as yet the schooner, to appearance, had not gained the least upon her. Three hours more, and the schooner gained on the chase. On and on sailed the pursuer and the pursued, the pirate schooner rapidly gaining, and it was evident would soon overtake the brig. Every moment lessened the distance between the two vessels, yet the captain of the brig maintained a hope of escape, as it was now but three hours' sail to Havana. He felt confident that if he could keep clear of the pirate for an hour, the brig would be safe; for the schooner, he believed, would not dare approach nearer than two hours' sail of Havana. An hour passed; the sun was setting, and the wind, which had for several hours been failing, died away as the sun went down. The brig was doomed. The two vessels now lay becalmed within half a mile of each other; and soon two boats were lowered over the side of the schooner, and came rapidly towards the brig.</p> 
                  <p>"We must fight for our lives, now," said the captain, "and you," continued he, turning to the mutineers, "I will not leave you to die like dogs, but free you and let you die like men, if die we must."</p> 
                  <p>Seymour and the Spaniards were liberated, and each armed with a pistol and cutlass. It was but a short time ere the boats were along side the brig, and in an instant several men leaped over the bows on to the deck, followed immediately by others. The foremost had not made three strides across the deck, ere Seymour with the quickness of thought, sprang upon the Englishman who had betrayed him, and seized him by the throat with so tight a grasp, that his face grew livid, and his eyes protruded frightfully. With brutal force he jammed the muzzle of the pistol into his mouth and fired, and ere the Englishman had known his foe, he fell to the deck a corpse.</p> 
                  <p>"Take that for vengeance, cursed dog," said Seymour, with fearful passion; "but for thee, this brig would now have been mine."</p> 
                  <p>Seymour had hardly accomplished his sanguinary deed, when Henrique, the young Spaniard, sprang with uplifted cutlass upon the captain, and buried it deep in his brain. But ere he could draw forth the blade, with a fearful yell he fell dead, shot through the heart by one of the English sailors. The pirate chief and his followers stood for a moment surprised; but next, their bloody work was commenced. The crew of the brig fought with desperation; but vainly; one by one they fell, till not one was left alive. Half a score of pirates had met their death, and their bloody corses now lay mingled with those of the brig's crew. Seymour had kept aloof from the fearful carnage and was not molested. The pirates, now masters of the brig, proceeded to rummage her, and everything of any value was brought on deck; the sails were out from their spars and stowed upon deck; and being entirely new, the chief had ordered them to be put aboard the schooner. It was midnight before their operations were completed; during all this time, Seymour had applied himself as diligently as any to the work, as if he were one of the horde.</p> 
                  <p>A light wind had now sprung up, and the Schooner was bearing down upon the brig, and soon lay alongside; and in an incredible short space of time, everything was transferred to her decks. Not a word had been spoken to Seymour till all were about to leave the brig, when the buccaneer chief advance I and said to him-</p> 
                  <p>"Young man, I have noticed that you have taken an active part with us. I know you not, but presume you are not ignorant as to who and what we are. It is needless for me to tell you we are sons of the sea, who serve no flag but the one that floats aloft. Beneath its blood-red folds we roam the broad main, on which our fortunes are cast; and as yet, old ocean has yielded bounteously its wealth. Wouldst thou be of our band?"</p> 
                  <p>"I cast my fortunes with you from this time," said Seymour; "yet I would-"</p> 
                  <p>"I know what you would say," rejoined the buccaneer. "Look there," and he pointed to a ghastly corse at their very feet, "there lies the dead body of my lieutenant. I cannot promise you his berth without the consent of the crew; but wait three days, and if I cannot give it you, and you will accept no other, you are free to leave us. But come, we must stay no longer here."</p> 
                  <p>And as he spoke, a column of flame burst from the hatchway. The brig had been fired. In a short time the fierce flames had wrapped her in their fiery mantle; and in an hour, nought remained of the beautiful craft but a smoking, blackened shell, and the half-consumed bodies of her murdered crew and the pirates in and around it. The piratical schooner had kept in towards the land, and was now hidden within the secret inlet we have referred to; she was the same craft whose mysterious disappearance we related in the first chapter.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
                  <p>WITHIN the hidden inlet was a spacious cave, whose entrance, a stranger with the utmost, strictest scrutiny, would have failed to discover, and known only to the band of freebooters who now possessed it. Here their plunder was from time to time deposited; and immense wealth it contained. Here those bloody outlaws spent their time in drunken carousings when not upon the sea.</p> 
                  <p>Four days Seymour remained with the pirates in their rendezvous, participating in all their debauchery and yielding to every excess of intemperance. On the evening of the fourth day, while in the midst of a boisterous carousal, the outlaws were surprised by the shrill signalwhistle of their chief. In an instant every voice was hushed, and all prepared to leave the cave. The object of their summons has already been described.</p> 
                  <p>Several months passed; the corsair had travelled many leagues over the broad main, and had twice returned to the secret rendezvous with freights of ill-gotten wealth.</p> 
                  <p>Seymour was yet the second officer of the pirate schooner: but from the first moment he had stepped his foot on board, but one thought had possessed his soul; one dark aspiring thought of fearful nature. He was the second in command-he must be the first. It was but a step, but that step was one of uncertainty, and only to be gained by the death of the buccaneer chief; and even then he felt there was no surety that the pirates would acknowledge him as their chief. But this thought had deterred him too long; he had resolved to remove Alvarez, the chief, from his path, and hazard the result.</p> 
                  <p>The very hour he had come to this determination, a Spanish brig of war was discovered bearing down upon the schooner, about six miles distant. As this announcement was made from the lookout, Seymour started as if struck with an electric shock. His eyes blazed fearfully bright, and his face wore a startling and peculiar expression; as if some new and sudden thought was awakened in his mind. It was so. A dark and devilish thought had that very instant flashed through his brain. Its nature and accomplishment will be seen anon.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"I will acquaint the chief of this," said he, disappearing down the companion-way.</p> 
                  <p>Alvarez was seldom on the deck of the schooner except when in chase, or escaping from a foe. His time was spent below in company of Gaspard, the youth he called his son, who possessed a strong influence over the pirate chieftain. Seymour had been below but a moment when he returned.</p> 
                  <p>"What think you was the order of our chief?" said he, addressing the crew in a low, deep tone.</p> 
                  <p>"We know not," was the response.</p> 
                  <p>"Keep the schooner on her course, deviate one point at the peril of your lives. This was his order. What think you is his motive?Brainless fools; have ye no thoughts? What can it be but our destruction? Listen, if ye would not be the victims of treachery. Know ye not an enormous reward is offered by the Spanish authorities for the capture of this schooner and her crew? Ha! ha! your thoughts have come at last. He has doubtless made a compact to betray and deliver the schooner into their hands. By so doing he will secure his pardon and the reward, and also our destruction."</p> 
                  <p>A deep murmur rose from the crew as he finished, and every hand grasped a shining stiletto. The countenance of Seymour bespoke a hellish joy as he observed this, and he again spoke,-</p> 
                  <p>SEE ENGRAVING.</p> 
                  <p>"Alvarez, your chief has basely deceived you. The youth Gaspard, whom he calls his son, is a woman. I discovered this when I went to tell him of the brig bearing down upon us. She has tempted, and he has yielded to the temptation. Through her influence our chief was made a traitor. Are ye now willing to be delivered into the power of your foes in yonder brig? Are you willing the traitor should purchase his pardon with your lives? Are you willing that he and his base mistress shall wallow in your wealth, while your lifeless bodies dangle at the yard-arm, and then thrown as food to fishes, or quartered and hung broiling beneath the blazing sun, as a warning to all who lead a rover's free life."</p> 
                  <p>"Never!" was the fierce, unanimous response of the crew, on whom the words of Seymour had produced a terrible effect.</p> 
                  <p>"Death! death to the traitor! Death to Alvarez; he is no longer our chief."</p> 
                  <p>The Spanish brig of war was within three miles, her gorgeous colors plainly in view, when the schooner was put before the wind, and in a few moments showed her superiority in sailing.</p> 
                  <p>"You have now no chief," said the wily young man, again addressing the crew; "who from among your ranks will ye chose as your leader?"</p> 
                  <p>For a moment all were silent; each man of the crew gazed around upon his fellows, as if at a loss who should henceforth be their chief. That single moment was one of the most intense suspense to Seymour. He dreaded lest their choice should not fall upon him. What if by his own plans to secure to himself the attainment of the dark ambitious thought that for months had possessed his soul, another should be chosen chief of the buccaneers? The thought to him was a maddening one, and with quivering lips and heaving breast, he waited the response of the crew, on which depended his highest earthly desire.</p> 
                  <p>"Who but Lenardo should be our chief," at length burst in unison from several of the crew. "Who but Lenardo, who saved us from the treachery of Alvarez?" The next moment the name of Lenardo burst from every lip, as all hailed their new chief.</p> 
                  <p>When Seymour entered the cabin of the chief, he was filled with extreme surprise on beholding a young female magnificently attired, reclining upon a couch, her head resting upon a cushion of crimson velvet, in the lap of Alvarez, who was regarding her face with looks of extreme fondness. A second glance at her features convinced Seymour that Gaspard and herself were one. The cabin door had been left by accident unlocked; he had surprised them. Both started to their feet as he entered, while a crimsoning blush suffused the face of the woman</p> 
                  <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6021-00000022"/> 
                  <p>"What wouldst thou?" asked the chief.</p> 
                  <p>"A Spanish brig of war is bearing down upon us, now about six miles distant," answered Seymour.</p> 
                  <p>"Run the schooner within sight of her teeth, and then pay her off before the wind, and show them her name," was the quick, decided response of Alvarez.</p> 
                  <p>"I am sorry thou'rt discovered, sweet Adelaide," said the chief, as Seymour left the cabin, to the blushing woman at his side. "But Lenardo is true, with him our secret is safe."</p> 
                  <p>Ha, ha, little dreamed he that Lenardo was false. Little thought he of being a victim to his treachery.</p> 
                  <p>"Ha! what means that shout," he exclaimed suddenly, "I hear the name of Lenardo shouted loudly. I must on deck."</p> 
                  <p>Ha, ha, little dreamed he of the fate that awaited him; so falsely betrayed-that that shout was his death knell. As he ascended the companion-way to the deck, he was suddenly seized by four or five of the crew, who brandished menacingly their sharp poniards.</p> 
                  <p>"Hell-hounds! what means this?" he said in a terrible voice, as recovering from his surprise, he struggled in vain to free himself from those who held him.</p> 
                  <p>"Release me, devils, or dread the vengeance of Alvarez," he again said, exerting himself with fearful strength to break free.</p> 
                  <p>"By heaven! 'tis the first time ye have ever dared to disregard my words. Ye have trembled at them till now."</p> 
                  <p>"They will fear you no more, traitor," said Seymour in a fierce tone, advancing toward him, "you are no longer master here; I am now the buccaneer chief."</p> 
                  <p>The betrayed chief cast at him a terrible, withering look.</p> 
                  <p>"False, dastardly wretch," he exclaimed in a voice of unbounded rage, while the fearful working of his face told the depth of the passion within. "By treachery you have attained your ambitious desire, but you are not chief till I am dead."</p> 
                  <p>"To death with the traitor!" said Seymour madly. "Bury your steels deep in his heart! Strike!"</p> 
                  <p>A dozen blades pierced him; he fell to the deck a corse. A fearful shriek was at that instant heard, and springing up the companion-way, Adelaide, the corsair's mistress, fell death like upon his bloody corse.</p> 
                  <p>"Bear her below," said Seymour to the men who stood gazing with surprise upon her who had always passed for the pirate's son.-"She has been the mistress of one chief, she shall be the mistress of another," he continued in a low tone, as the lifeless form of the woman was borne from the deck.</p> 
                  <p>"I am now your chief, as ye have one and all proclaimed me," said Seymour to the horde around him. "Let every man dip the blood of yonder traitor with his poniard. Now swear to be as true to me as ye were to him, till he proved false to you-swear!"</p> 
                  <p>"We swear!" was the deep response, while in the right hand of every man was held aloft the ensanguined blade.</p> 
                  <p>"And I swear to be true to you, or may his doom be mine."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
                  <p>WITH a heavy shot attached to each of his hands and feet, the betrayed and murdered chief was cast into the sea. Thus ended his career, and with his death began the dark and fearful career of William Seymour, or Lenardo, by which name he was known among the buccaneers.</p> 
                  <p>The schooner was now put away for the secret inlet, then about two days' sail distant. During a short stay here, and outside covering of canvass closely fitting the hull of the schooner was prepared. This in a very short space of time could be drawn over her hull, effecting a complete and effectual disguise. It was painted a bright green, with a narrow red line, and descended a short distance into the water, laying close to the vessel's sides. The vessel's name was changed by Seymour and called the Black Vulture, and the blood-red flag gave place to one wrought by his own hands, for description of which see "Rival Brothers." A short time and the Black Vulture was coursing the blue waves of the Atlantic, which Seymour had determined should be the field of his future career.</p> 
                  <p>The first prize of the pirate was a large and heavily freighted East Indiaman, which was captured within four days'sail of New York. The Indiaman was fully and ably manned, and the crew fought long and desperately in her defence, but were at length compelled to yield to the overpowering force of the pirates; but not until the gory corses of two-thirds their number were strown upon the bloody deck. Among those who had fought in defence of the ship, was a young man named Edward Elmore, a passenger in the ill-fated vessel. He had been for several years a resident in the East; had married the only daughter of one of the wealthiest merchants of India. With his fair young bride, and a young and lovely babe, he had embarked in the "Oriental" for his native land. When aware that the ship was brought to by the pirates, he had left his agonized bride for the deck of the Indiaman, and offered his aid in the fearful contest. With his own hand he had sent four of the pirates to their last account. He had fought hand to hand with the buccaneer ohieftain, and wounded him; but in warding a<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6021-00000023"/> furious blow his blade was shivered to the hilt, and he stood defenceless and at the mercy of the chief, whose gory blade circling above his head threatened his instant doom. The sweeping cutlass descended but harmed him not.</p> 
                  <p>"I spare you," said the chief in a terrible voice, as the point of his weapon, dripping with blood, touched the deck; "I spare you for now."</p> 
                  <p>He was spared; but for a fate far worse than that which had just threatened him; for agonies far more terrible than death's. Better had the reeking blade of the pirate pierced his brain, than to have spared him then. Leaving the young man in the hands of several of the crew, the pirate chief descended below. On deck the scene was horrible; covered with blood and strewn with bleeding, ghastly corses. What few remained of the ship's crew were entirely at the mercy of the pirates, who, begrimmed and blackened with powder, and besmeared with blood, resembled more a troop of fiends than human beings.</p> 
                  <p>Besides young Elmore and his wife, there were a number of other passengers in the ship, among whom were several females, who were subjected to the most brutal violence by the pirates, before the very eyes of their fathers, brothers or husbands, who mourned but dare not murmur. Every jewel, or ornament of any kind or value, about their persons, they were robbed of, and commanded to deliver up all valuables they were otherwise possessed of. Heart-rending cries of the females, and vain appeals for mercy, mingled with loud vociferous oaths of the pirates, filled the cabin. Amid this scene Seymour entered the splendid cabin of the Indiaman. The terrified females threw themselves at the feet of the pirate chief, and with clasped hands, and upturned faces, with burning tears gushing from their eyes, and with voices choked with anguish, they begged for mercy. But in vain were their supplications. With a face unmoved, and a heart of stone, Seymour gazed upon the agonized beings around him, then turned from the cabin into the state-room, from which he soon passed into an other, till at last he came to one the door of which was locked. Low, suppressed sobs came to his ears from within. He listened for a moment, then lightly rapped at the door. In a moment he again rapped louder than before. His summons received no notice.</p> 
                  <p>"Unlock this door!" he said in a loud, fierce tone, again rapping.</p> 
                  <p>But his summons was not obeyed. One blow from the pirate's cutlass, and the door flew open. As he entered, a young and lovely woman with a beautiful infant clasped to her breast, threw herself, weeping, at his feet.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, spare me! spare me!" she cried in a voice of the deepest anguish. "Spare my babe, my infant boy!"</p> 
                  <p>Seymour gazed for a moment at the fair being at his feet, with a look, not of pity, but of fierce, unhallowed passion. His lighted eye, his quivering lip and flushed countenance be spoke the fiend within.</p> 
                  <p>"By Heaven! this is loveliness," he exclaimed to himself, gazing with deep passion upon the kneeling woman. "Never before have my eyes beheld such beauty. By heaven! she shall be mine, and mine only."</p> 
                  <p>"Rise, fair lady," said he taking her fair, white hand, and speaking in a tone of voice that belied his heart; "rise, no harm shall come to thee or thy babe."</p> 
                  <p>The beautiful woman rose to her feet. Beautiful in form and feature; beautiful in sorrow, she stood before the pirate chief, a model of all that was lovely. Better had nature never granted her such beauty.</p> 
                  <p>"Thou hast said no harm shall come to my child, or me; but has harm come to my husband, my Edmund. Oh! tell me, tell me quickly!"</p> 
                  <p>"Thy husband? then thou art the mother of this child?"</p> 
                  <p>"I am."</p> 
                  <p>"Thy husband? was he young, fair in look, and brave of heart?"</p> 
                  <p>"'Twas so I thought him."</p> 
                  <p>Seymour gazed down for a moment in silence.</p> 
                  <p>"I fear me, lady, he is slain," he at length said, in a tone of compassion he felt not.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Slain! Oh God! my Edmund, my Edmund dead. No, no, 'tis false, he is not dead! You do not mean it, you trifle with me."</p> 
                  <p>"Lady, I have spoken as I believe."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh Heaven, is it so? Edmund, my loved, loved Edmund dead! and this poor babe left fatherless? Oh! would to God!-but 'tis his will."</p> 
                  <p>Clasping her infant closely to her breast, the young mother sank upon a couch, and gave way to the wildest paroxysm of grief. The beautiful infant boy smiled sweetly, unconscious of its mother's sorrow. Any but a heart of stone would have melted. The buccaneer gazed at the lovely, sorrowing woman, but his face betrayed no emotion; his eye relaxed not its guilty, fearful light. He spoke:</p> 
                  <p>"Lady, this wild grief befits thee not; cheer up. Thou mayst yet be happy. Beauty such as thine should not be wasted thus in sorrow. Lady, thou hast lost thy husband, but gained a lover. Nay, start not. I love thee. Wouldst thou wed me, wealth untold shall be at thy command."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh stay thy words, in the name of heaven cease. My husband, my Edmund murdered, and you, perhaps, his-murderer. Away!-away!" Frantic was her grief.</p> 
                  <p>"Hold, lady, calm your grief. I did but jest with thee to try thy love. Methinks thy husband is not slain, but yet lives."</p> 
                  <p>"Lives! oh, say you so; my Edmund lives? Then shall I behold him; again clasp him in my arms. Oh, lead me to him quickly, if you would not crush the hope you have given life, within this bosom." And she cast herself imploringly at the feet of the buccaneer.</p> 
                  <p>"I had spoken his doom; but you shall see him,-shall save him."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! lead me then quickly to him, if I can save him."</p> 
                  <p>"On one condition you can see him, and save him."</p> 
                  <p>As he spoke, her gaze met his. An expression of terrible meaning she read in his gaze. A fearful thought she realized.</p> 
                  <p>"The condition-name it," she said in a tremulous voice, her cheeks blanched to the hue of death.</p> 
                  <p>"Wed me, and he is saved."</p> 
                  <p>"Never! monster. Thou hast doomed him thou shalt doom me. And were it my doom to linger and perish beside the corse of him I love, I would embrace the doom, ay, cling to his corse till death, rather than wed thee."</p> 
                  <p>Her flashing eye, impassioned words, and look of bitterest scorn, produced no effect upon the fiend before her, other than it brought a smile to his face.</p> 
                  <p>"Nay; but it shall not be so. I will yet win thee." He advanced towards her.</p> 
                  <p>"Back, back, touch me not," she shrieked.</p> 
                  <p>His hand was laid upon her. Quicker than thought she plucked from his belt a jewelled dagger he carried there.</p> 
                  <p>"Now I am saved; now I am free," she said, as the pirate started back at this sudden, unexpected act. "Advance one step nearer me, and I free myself and babe forever from your power; my death be upon your head."</p> 
                  <p>Spirited and determined were the words of the beautiful woman, as she stood with the dagger raised in her right hand, above her bosom and her child. Seymour gazed at her for a moment with a kindled eye, then said:</p> 
                  <p>"By heaven! thou hast nerve and spirit too. Ha, ha! thou art well fit to be a corsair's bride, and thou shalt be; I swear it."</p> 
                  <p>He sprang towards her. That moment sealed her fate. Quick as lightning the dagger descended into the bosom of her child, and ere the arm of the pirate could stay her's, the reeking blade was buried to the hilt in her heaving bosom. Mother and child fell lifeless to the floor. Freed from dishonor by death, and beautiful even in death, lay the wife of Edmund Elmore, weltering in her life's blood.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
                  <p>FOILED in his damnable design, and muttering a oath, the pirate stooped down, and bending over the bleeding corpse of his victim, grasped the hilt of the dagger to draw it forth. As he did so a piercing cry of wildest agony smote his ear.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh God! my wife, my child!" were the words of young Elmore, uttered in a startling tone of horror as he at that moment sprang into the room. With a wild cry he sprang towards his murdered wife, and then as if with held by an unseen hand, he stood motionless and immovable, as a statue of marble. The point of the cutlass he carried pierced the floor; the hilt was firmly grasped in his right hand, while his left was buried in the flowing locks of his hair. His face was dreadfully pale; his lips colorless and quivering; his eyes seemed bursting from their sockets, so intense was their gaze. He stood-the picture of despair, and as he gazed at the corpse before him, his look was terrible. Suddenly the spell that bound him was broken; his face relaxed the rigid, fearful look; and life, which seemed to have fled for a moment, now gave him motion. He sank to the floor beside the corse of her he so fondly loved, and clasping her hands within his, exclaimed in a voice of anguish:</p> 
                  <p>"Louise, Louise, my loved, loved wife, awake! speak, thou art not dead! 'Tis Edmund, oh speak! Live, oh live for him; my heart's loved idol."</p> 
                  <p>In agony he pressed her hands within his own; kissed her cold fingers; to her lips, yet warm, he pressed his. Yet no answer came from the lips of his loved Louise. Her sweet voice he never again would hear. Again and again he pressed her hands; again and again he pressed those lips that had oft returned the kiss, but now they were sealed forever; he laid his hand upon her fair brow-the seal of death was there; then, upon her heart-but no life was there. His babe lay dead upon its mother's breast, over which its life's blood had welled: he placed his lips to its face, it was cold and he shuddered as he gazed.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh God!" he exclaimed in agonizing woe, "my wife, my child, my infant boy-dead!- both dead. Oh God! was this thy will?" Buying his face in his hands, upon the bosom of his wife, he gave way to the most poignant and heart-rending grief. Suddenly he started; drew forth the dagger from the breast of the corse, and grasping the cutlass that lay beside him, he sprang to his feet; changed, fearfully changed. Casting one look at the bodies of his wife and child, he turned to the buccaneer, who had stood with folded arms, a few paces from him during the sad scene. A fiendish smile played round the lips of the pirate as he met the gaze of the young man.</p> 
                  <p>"Monster! inhuman, hell-born fiend! this is thy work; this is thy deed. Look there!-if thou hadst a heart 'twould melt at the sight.-Thy myrmidons themselves, accustomed as they are to scenes of cruel slaughter and bloodshed, would weep at this sad sight. But thou, fiend incarnate! canst look with an unpitying eye, and unmoved face; but thy crimes are done: thy deeds are ended. By heaven! vengeance shall now be mine." With a force which desperation alone could give, he sprang with uplifted cutlass upon Seymour, who received the fierce blow upon the edge of his own weapon, but so powerful and instantaneous was the shock, that he staggered several paces back, and with a vain effort to recover himself, fell prostrate to the floor. With one foot upon the breast of the pirate, young Elmore stood; a faint smile played on his lips as he gazed down upon him. With a nerved arm he raised his cutlass. One moment and his vengeance would be completed. Poised above his head for a moment his weapon fell, but an interposing blade received the blow intended for the pirate chief, and saved his life.</p> 
                  <p>At that very instant young Elmore was seized in the powerful grasp of several of the pirates who had been drawn thither by the clash of weapons, and the heavy fall of their chief, who now freed, rose to his feet, and in a voice of unutterable rage said:-</p> 
                  <p>"Bind him quickly and convey him to the schooner. Let him not escape, on your lives; I have to do with him."</p> 
                  <p>His order was quickly obeyed, the unhappy man was conveyed on board the pirate schooner, immediately followed by Seymour and his crew. Their inhuman work was ended. The ship had been thoroughly rummaged by the pirates, and as much of the most valuable part of the cargo as could be conveniently stowed away in the schooner had been taken by them. The schooner was now cleared from the ship, and in an hour was lost from the ship, and in an hour was lost from view. It was on the following day that Seymour was pacing the deck of the schooner: an angry flush overspread his face, and his countenance betrayed the existence of some terrible thought within. Suddenly in a fierce tone, he ordered a boat, which had been taken from the Oriental, to be lowered away, and a running noose to be affixed to the fore-yard-arm. The orders of the chief were quickly obeyed.</p> 
                  <p>"Now the prisoner: bring him on deck."</p> 
                  <p>A moment elapsed, and young Elmore, led by two of the pirates, stood upon the deck-With an unfaltering step he walked between the two ruffians, to within a few feet of where the chief stood. His face bore the stamp of deepest sorrow, yet he gazed with an eye undaunted into the face of the buccaneer; and as he caught sight of the yard-arm a slight smile parted his lips, and he cast at the monster before him a calm yet scornful look of defiance. He knew he was doomed; yet his eye quailed not; he scorned to b8etray fear or emotion.</p> 
                  <p>"Young man," said Seymour in a chiding tone, "you are to die! I your death alone will appease those by whom you are surrounded. Pour of my crew, who but yesterday walked this deck, were slain by you; and now your time has come. But you shall have the choice of the manner of your death. It was for this I sent for you."</p> 
                  <p>Taking a small phial filled with a colorless liquid, and holding it forth in his hand, Seymour said:</p> 
                  <p>"This contains the deadliest poison; one drop and life is fled. This, the yard arm, or an open boat, are the three alternatives, of which you will have your choice. Decide quickly."</p> 
                  <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6021-00000025"/> 
                  <p>The eye of young Elmore rested for a moment upon the phial containing the fatal poison-one drop brought sure and speedy death. He glanced his eye aloft: the yard-arm with its dangling noose met his gaze. Death there was as sure from the poison, yet not so instantaneous and far more terrible to the mind: he thought of the boat drifting upon the open sea; with starvation, the most horrible of deaths, staring him in the face. Yet there was a ray of hope-faint, yet it was hope. For a moment he thought-his choice was made.</p> 
                  <p>"Have you decided?" asked the chief.</p> 
                  <p>"I have."</p> 
                  <p>"Your choice?"</p> 
                  <p>"The boat."</p> 
                  <p>"'Tis well! yet methinks my choice would not have been thine. Comrades, he has made his choice. The boat-away with him."</p> 
                  <p>Instantly the young man was seized and thrust over the side of the vessel into the boat.</p> 
                  <p>"Am I to have no food?" he asked, as the fiends were about to cast him adrift.</p> 
                  <p>"'None!" answered Seymour.</p> 
                  <p>"Water?"</p> 
                  <p>"None," he again answered with a fiendish smile upon his lips, as he leaned with folded arms against the bulwarks.</p> 
                  <p>"Inhuman monster, this is worse than death."</p> 
                  <p>"It was thy choice," he said, "'tis too late to retract."</p> 
                  <p>"Be it so, fiend, but I will yet live for revenge, revenge."</p> 
                  <p>Seymour with his own hand cast the boat adrift; as he did so a flask of wine was thrust into the hand of young Elmore, by one of the crew, the only one among them who betrayed a look of pity. This caught the quick eye of the chief, and a terrible frown darkened his brow. Drawing a pistol from his belt, he fired, and he who had been guilty of pity, fell to the deck a corpse.</p> 
                  <p>"That, for thy interference, fool!" he exclaimed in a voice of rage, as he returned the smoking instrument of death to his belt-"He'll make food for the sharks; over with him,"he continued in a fierce tone. "Such be the fate of all who meddle with my purposes."</p> 
                  <p>Elmore uttered an exclamation of horror, as the corpse sank in the waves at the side of the boat, and in a voice that smote to the hearts of all on board the schooner, exclaimed:</p> 
                  <p>"May God's curse descend on you in your dying hour for this!"</p> 
                  <p>A moment more and the schooner was beyond the reach of his voice. A short time and the boat was but a speck upon the ocean; then it was lost to the sight. With naught to protect him from the chilling air of night, or shield him from the burning heat of day; without one morsel of food, one draught of water, was young Elmore left to his fate.</p> 
                  <p>Such were the scenes that marked the first capture of the Black Vulture. Such were the deeds that commenced the fearful and bloody career of William Seymour. From that time for nearly a year the Black Vulture ploughed the Atlantic, the curse and scourge of its waters; and of her terrible fame we have alluded to at some length in the Rival Brothers. Seymour had hoisted the free flag in defiance of all others; but towards the star and stripes was his enmity the more exclusively directed. He had sworn himself forever an enemy to the flag of his country. He had sworn to become a terror to the Atlantic; his oath was kept.</p> 
                  <p>For nearly a year until the breaking out of the war, was his career marked by crimes of the darkest dye. Bloodshed and rapine every where followed his appearance. Favored by the superior speed of his schooner, as also the disguise he had prepared for her, he roamed the Atlantic with impunity, and many and fearful were his piracies; till at length with the commencement of the war the Black Vulture disappeared from the waters.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI</head> 
                  <p>THE war between the two countries had been carried on a year; when towards the close of one of the loveliest days of summer an American privateer schooner entered and came to anchor within the broad bay of the harbor of New York. At her peak floated the stars and stripes. At her main waved a small white flag, in the centre of which was represented the letter "R."</p> 
                  <p>A thousand eyes had watched the schooner from the first moment she have in sight, till she came to anchor in the bay; when a thousand voices swelled high upon the air with repeated cheers. The schooner was of the most beautiful model, and commanded praise from every lip. Her hull was painted a bright green beautifully relieved by a narrow red ribbon around her waist. Her snow white topsails, furled with all the nicety and precision of those of a man-of-war, contrasted vividly with the dead black hue of her yards and masts. The schooner had been an hour at anchor, when a boat was lowered over her side, and in a moment put off from her. Upon one of the slips, amongst the numerous spectators who had been watching the privateer, stood Fitz Alwyn, arm-in-arm with a young associate.</p> 
                  <p>"Ned, I believe she is making for this slip,"said Fitz Alwyn to his companion, pointing to the boat now half way between the schooner and the slip, and making as he said towards the latter.</p> 
                  <p>His conjecture was right; but a few moments elapsed, ere the boat touched at the slip, and a young man, neatly clad in a pair of snow-white flowing pants, and round, blue jacket, leaped lightly in the midst of the spectators, who gave way to the right and left, allowing him a passage. As he passed through their midst, his eye glanced round upon the hundreds, whose gaze was fixed on his, as if he sought recognisance. He had nearly cleared the crowd, when his eye fell upon one, who started as he met his gaze.</p> 
                  <p>"Fitz Alwyn!" he exclaimed, springing towards the young man and grasping both his hands, "Fitz Alwyn, is this you? by Heaven! you are the one above all others, whom I most wish to see."</p> 
                  <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6021-00000026"/> 
                  <p>"Good God! is this Bill Seymour?" exclaimed Fitz Alwyn, in a tone that expressed the deepest surprise. It is, as I live."</p> 
                  <p>"You have guessed aright," said the other.</p> 
                  <p>"But my name, not so loud here, if you please. How is this, Fitz? I see you don't sport the navy blue. How is it? has Uncle Sam graciously presented you your time, in consideration of past services, or did you leave him without his leave?"</p> 
                  <p>"Why, to tell the truth, Bill, that little affair of ours, by some means got wind, and some terribly knowing ones, asserting their suspicion that I had to do with it, made my quarters rather too hot for me, so to save Uncle Sam the disagreable duty of discharging me I discharged myself. Several days after, I had the agreable pleasure of reading in one of the prints, of one George Fitz Alwyn being cashiered from the U. S. N."</p> 
                  <p>"Ha, ha, that pleasure was mine once, and I've had"-and he whispered in the ear of Fitz Alwyn-"revenge. But enough, Fitz, an hour before midnight meet me at Black Ben's. Will you?"</p> 
                  <p>"An hour before midnight? yes I will."</p> 
                  <p>The two young men now parted, and Seymour walking rapidly through several streets, turned at last into a narrow and darkened lane, till at length he stopped, and knocked at the door of a low building.</p> 
                  <p>"Who's there?" asked a gruff voice in answer to the summons of the young man.</p> 
                  <p>"Open the door and you will know," answered Seymour.</p> 
                  <p>A bolt was withdrawn, and the door was opened by a tall negro, with a visage ugly and frightfully black.</p> 
                  <p>"De Lord! Massa William, dis you. Bress me if I ever spec to see you." Grasping the young man by the arm he drew him within, and bolted the door. "Lord bress you, whar you come from? Ya, ya, old Ben lubs to see old friends-old Ben lub Massa William."</p> 
                  <p>"I know it," responded Seymour, "you're the same old boy; black as ever, and have the same good heart. But Ben, I'm here on business now. I want a room, and pen, ink and paper. Here, take this," and he placed in the negro's hand a shining yellow coin.</p> 
                  <p>"You shall hab dem, Massa William, you shall hab'em, cum wid me."</p> 
                  <p>Seymour followed the black into a small room, where in a few moments were set before him the materials he had requested.</p> 
                  <p>"An hour before midnight," said he to the negro, "Fitz will come here to see me. Bring him here when he comes."</p> 
                  <p>At the appointed hour, Fitz Alwyn repaired to the house of Black Ben, and was shown by that personage into the room with Seymour.-As he entered, Seymour grasped his hands and shook them heartily, and after gazing into his face for a moment, said, "you are the same Fitz as you were two years ago when I last saw you. But tell me, how does the world go with thee? Does fortune smile or frown?"</p> 
                  <p>"Dame Fortune and myself are hand in hand," said Fitz Alwyn.</p> 
                  <p>"And how does she use thee?"</p> 
                  <p>"Well, a cool thousand she has yielded me this night, since three hours ago we met;" and he spread out the notes and coin to that amount.</p> 
                  <p>"Fortune, indeed, smiled on you to-night; to-morrow, and she'll play thee false. Fitz, you should lead a freer life-one like mine."</p> 
                  <p>"Privateering?" said Fitz in a tone half inquiring and half sneer.</p> 
                  <p>"The privateer wars with the flag her country wars with; there are freer flags afloat, Fitz." Seymour spoke this significantly, and he bent his keen gaze upon Alwyn who uttered a single exclamation-"Ha!" he glanced his eye at Seymour, and a sudden, dark suspicion flashed through his brain.</p> 
                  <p>"Seymour, what mean you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Mean! that there are flags that war with all others; such a one is mine. Is my meaning now taken?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is. By Heaven! you mean you are a pirate?"</p> 
                  <p>"If thou canst not find a term more courteous, why call me-pirate."</p> 
                   
                  <p>Springing back several paces, Fitz Alwyn gazed with a look of deepest surprise at him, while yet an expression of doubt rested on his face.</p> 
                  <p>"Fitz, have you ever heard of the Black Vulture?"</p> 
                  <p>"The Black Vulture! I have, and who has not?"</p> 
                  <p>"Did you ever see her?"</p> 
                  <p>"No."</p> 
                  <p>"You have. Fitz, I will speak plain and boldly. I am her commander; she lies at anchor not a mile from here."</p> 
                  <p>"Good heavens! you the commander of the Black Vulture?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ay! How would like the life of free rovers of the sea."</p> 
                  <p>"Well! by Heaven!" exclaimed Fitz Alwyn, his eyes flashing with fire.</p> 
                  <p>"Will you join me? you shall have the second command."</p> 
                  <p>"I will. I am yours," said Alwyn, offering his hand to Seymour. It was hastily grasped by him who said-"Fitz we are now one. I have placed myself wholly in your power. I am yours; you can betray me or not, as you will, yet I ask no oath of you. It was solely to find you that I came here. I have you and as I wished; I have that in my mind which can only be accomplished by your aid. Can I rely upon it?"</p> 
                  <p>"You can."</p> 
                  <p>"Then listen. Fitz, I loved passionately, ay, madly loved a fair and beauteous maiden. I had a rival-he was my brother. To him she gave her heart. The maddening truth that she loved not me but him, I heard from her own lips. I swore to thwart him in his love. I sought her, and would have ruined her, but he saved her. I fled, but swore terrible revenge. Fitz Alwyn, she must 'and shall be mine! It is now two years since I left home; and since then they have not heard of me save my death-"</p> 
                  <p>"Your death?" exclaimed Fitz Alwyn, with surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"Ay! they think me dead. List-a year ago or more, in New Orleans I was challenged-I fought and killed my man. He was a stranger there; none knew him or me. I gave my name for his and so it was reported. In a disguised hand I wrote my brother informing him of his brother's death. The letter was received as I learned afterward. One year ago I was in Boston, a short time after this war commenced. There I saw my father and her whom I once loved. I saw my brother-my hated rival in love. I whispered one sentence in his ear that thrilled the blood to his very heart. I had but uttered it, when he turned-his eyes met mine, but he knew me not-that sentence paralyzed for a time all bright thoughts within; it was a meaning one and has yet to be fulfilled. It was this:</p> 
                  <p>'The hawk is on the wing; let the timid dove beware its stoop.'</p> 
                  <p>Such were the words I whispered him, just as he was leaving the pier on which I stood for a schooner that lay anchored beyond-a privateer; her name was the Flying Arrow, and he, as I learned was her commander and owner, from his father. I saw the schooner depart; she was a beautiful craft, and had she been modelled after mine that lay anchored-disguised as she now is, within pistol shot of her-two crafts could not have been more like. I would have followed-would have fought him; but his schooner was manned by a hundred men. I had but forty. For twice that number, I would have given worlds, had I possessed them. Revenge was beyond me then; I will seek it now at my soul's peril. Ere three suns have set, the Black Vulture shall be anchored in Boston Bay. My brother is doubtless now upon the ocean; if he is, Clara Wildon is mine."</p> 
                  <p>"How and by what means will you accomplish this?" asked Fitz Alwyn.</p> 
                  <p>"Easily, and by means of these," answered Seymour, throwing down as he spoke three letters upon the table, each bearing a superscription; "Listen; your name, Fitz Alwyn, has often been spoken at home, as a friend, both by Warren and myself, and is familiar with<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6021-00000027"/> those to whom these letters are directed. They are written in my brother's hand and by heaven, he himself would own the writing, and yet forswear it. My plan is this. You are to have the command of the Rambler, as I call my schooner when in disguise. You noticed that her hull was painted green."</p> 
                  <p>"I did."</p> 
                  <p>"It is but a covering, that hides the blackest hull that floats the sea. But as I said, in this enterprise you are to have the command of the privateer schooner Rambler, and run her into Boston Bay. These letters you will deliver as they are directed. One to my father, one to the father of Clara Wildon; and the other to Clara herself. Her's is a tender epistle of love; love, ha, ha."</p> 
                  <p>Seymour laughed bitterly as he spoke, and tossing the letters to Fitz Alwyn, said, "you can read them all, and then I will seal the one to her. I have written them this evening and had but finished her's as you entered.-These letters," continued he, as Fitz Alwyn finished them, "will gain for you the most cordial friendship from those who receive them, filled as they are with warmest praise from Warren, from whom they purport to be. After several days have passed, inform your friends that you will have to sail on some near approaching day; and invite them on board the Rambler for a pleasure trip. Invite a goodly number and fail not in gaining the consent of Clara Wildon to be one of the number. Once upon the deck of the Black Vulture she is mine, and forever. You have now heard my plan and all I have to say. Are you mine in this or will you retract?"</p> 
                  <p>"Retract! no, by Heaven! I am yours. I like the game, and long to begin the play were it this very night."</p> 
                  <p>"You shall not long wait; ere tomorrow's sunset the privateer schooner Rambler shall be on her way to Boston. Meet me tomorrow at noon, at the slip we met to-night, or rather last, for it is morning now. I had not dreamed the time was so far advanced. An hour past midnight I had ordered my men to come for me where they had landed me-they wait for me. Fitz, remember, to-morrow noon; I will be there for you."</p> 
                  <p>Both now left the house of Black Ben, and separated till the morrow, when at the hour appointed Fitz Alwyn repaired to the slip where were in waiting, Seymour and half a dozen of his crew, with a boat into which he stepped, and soon after stood upon the deck of the Black Vulture.</p> 
                  <p>"Come below, Fitz," said Seymour, taking the arm of the young man. "You must see the cabin. Get the schooner under weigh," he ordered as he descended the companion way.</p> 
                  <p>As Fitz Alwyn entered the cabin, he was struck with astonishment at the lavish splendor that met his gaze, and he uttered an exclamation of wonder. The cabin of the Black Vulture was furnished in a style of gorgeous splendor and magnificence, that would have done honor to the seraglio of an Eastern Prince.</p> 
                  <p>"What think you of my cabin?" asked Seymour, after a few moments' silence.</p> 
                  <p>"Had I been taken here without knowledge of where I was, I should have sworn it was the boudoir of a queen rather than the cabin of a-"</p> 
                  <p>"Speak it out, Fitz, you mean the cabin of a pirate craft, do you not? ha, ha. You have paid it a compliment, Fitz, how think you it will please the taste of the fair Clara?"</p> 
                  <p>"Why, as to the luxurious splendor that is here, a queen might be content. But a bird ensnared, and imprisoned within a gilded cage, would pine for liberty; leave it but a chance to escape and it would quickly leave the gilded prison house for freedom and the green woods again."</p> 
                  <p>"Sentimental, Fitz, but right, I suppose," said Seymour with alaugh; "but there is no refuge on the broad blue sea, if once the bird is imprisoned here."</p> 
                  <p>"Ay! but first catch the bird; then keep it," said Fitz Alwyn, in a tone that savored slightly of raillery.</p> 
                  <p>"Well! I've set the snare; catch the game if I can. But come, let us on deck, the schooner id in motion. Do saying, they left the cabin.</p> 
                   
                  <p>The schooner was well under way as they came on deck; and at sunset of the second day afterward was anchored in Boston Harbor.-The arrival of the privateer schooner Rambler, the introduction of Fitz Alwyn, the delivery of the forged letters; and the too successful termination of the plotting of William Seymour for the abduction of Clara Wildon, have already been recounted in the chapters of the foregoing story to which this is a sequel; as also the sham mutiny on board the Black Vulture, and her departure with Clara Wildon, the victim of Seymour, on board and in the power of the pirate.</p> 
                  <p>When torn from her father by the two ruffian pirates, she swooned, and was conveyed below to the cabin, where was Fitz Alwyn, who had been released as soon as he was taken from the deck. Depositing the lifeless form of Clara Wildon on a couch, the two men were peremptorily ordered to leave the cabin by Fitz Alwyn, who instantly proceeded, by every means advised, to restore the inanimate form of the young maiden to consciousness. He chafed her snow white hands, laved her temples, and the most powerful aromatic drugs he applied to her nostrils, but without the lightest effect.-For a time his efforts were unavailing. The seal of death seemed set forever upon her fair brow. When suddenly a slight shudder ran through her frame, followed by a violent trembling-a fearful start-and her eyes opened, and with a wild, vacant stare, she gazed round the apartment.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh God! where am I?" she wildly exclaimed. "That dream-oh it was a terrible dream. Methought I was torn from my father, by savage men-but this place, it is strange to me;" and again she gazed round the room; her eyes fell upon Fitz Alwyn, who had started back, when first she had revived.</p> 
                  <p>"Fitz Alwyn!" she exclaimed, springing to her feet, "you here? then it was no dream, Oh God! is it reality. My father, oh where is he? Oh tell me, is he safe? is he unharmed?"</p> 
                  <p>"He is," said Fitz Alwyn.</p> 
                  <p>"Thank God! he is safe! but save me, Fitz Alwyn, from these dreadful men."</p> 
                  <p>"I will, I swear it."</p> 
                  <p>"But you were thrown to the deck and bound, and are now free."</p> 
                  <p>"It was so, Miss Wildon," said Fitz Alwyn, drawing near to her, and speaking in a low voice. "It was the work of treachery. Listen to me and you shall know all. It was through my agency, monster that I am, that you were placed here, and in the power of one who seeks, ay, one who has sworn your ruin. Who he is, you may not know, but shall ere long. I lent my aid in this foul play, freely, as mere sport. Oh! that I had withdrawn it ere it was too late. Nay, reproach me not, fair lady, I would have saved thee--"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, when too late," said Clara, bitterly.</p> 
                  <p>"It was too late, indeed, but the order to tack and run the schooner for the city, was upon my lips, when the signal for the foul outrage was given. The order was useless then, I should have betrayed my purpose, and been without power to befriend you now. As it was, I had well nigh lost all, when I gave the lie to him who was interrogated by your father, as to whether I had aught to do with the base deed. What I thought had betrayed me, proved to have a favorable, though mistaken impression upon one, who, had he thought that I would play him false, would order me, with out the slightest hesitation, to swing at the yard-arm. Yet I have played him false, he knows it not, that I have sworn to frustrate his abomniable design."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
                  <p>"WHO is he of whom you speak?" asked Clara of Fitz Alwyn.</p> 
                  <p>"Not now, but to-morrow I will inform you,"answered he. "I must now depart. But remember, Miss Wildon, in me you have a friend. No harm shall come to you while Fitz Alwyn breathes. Six hours ago I was his friend, now I am his sworn enemy, and thy friend; you will rest here to-night without fear. There is none who dare enter here, but one, and he will not this night, or never, if I can prevent it. Tomorrow morn, I will be here again; rest and fear not."</p> 
                  <p>Fitz Alwyn left the cabin. Left alone, Clara threw herself upon the couch, and burst into tears.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh cruel, cruel fate!" she exclaimed in her grief; "why was I torn from my home, from my only parent, whose grief is perhaps now greater than mine? My father, oh, why was I torn from thee? perhaps forever! The thought is torture. Oh, Warren! why were you not there to save? In whose power I am I know not; yet I fear-yes, I mistrust Fitz Alwyn alone was the author of this deed. His words to me I fear were false. The one of whom he speaks, I believe is none other than himself; yet he spoke with the semblance of earnest truth. He has said that he aided, but was not the originator. He says he is my friend, that no harm shall befall me while he lives. May heaven grant him the power, if his words are true, to protect me. Oh God! if he has spoken falsely, I fear a dreadful fate awaits me; I know not what. Oh! cruel, unaccountable destiny-but I should not murmur: 'tis the will of one who watches over all."</p> 
                  <p>She rose from the couch and paced the floor; and gave way to grief she could not banish. Hours she paced the floor of the cabin; rest came not to relieve the sorrowing maiden; sleep closed not her eyes that long, long night of harrowing grief to her, till breaking morn, when nature, exhausted by her poignant grief, gave way; she sank into a gradual and profound slumber.</p> 
                  <p>When Fitz Alwyn left the cabin, he went on deck; the sun was down, darkness was fast mantling the waters, and the schooner was flying rapidly before the wind, which swelled every inch of her canvass. He walked forward and met Seymour who accosted him.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, Fitz, the bird is caged, thanks to you. Ha, ha, she is mine now, and none can dispute it. Thus far my revenge is attained. Would that I could see my brother when he returns; when he leaves his schooner, proud of the laurels he has won, for the home of his loved, betrothed bride; when he leaves his schooner, buoyant with hope and love, to find her whom he fondly loves gone! torn from him forever. Ha, ha, would I could witness his agony when he learns the fate of Clara Wildon. Could I but see the burst of frantic, agonizing grief that will possess his soul, and rend asunder all bright hopes within him; then would the hatred that has long rankled within me be assuaged; then would revenge, which has long burned here," and he smote his breast as he spoke, "be accomplished. Fury!" he exclaimed, suddenly and fiercely, "I have missed half my revenge. Why did I not reveal myself, when I had my prize secure, and made known into whose hands she had fallen, that he, my brother might have known. But 'twill be enough for him forever. Ha, ha,"bitterly he laughed. "Will he not remember the words I whispered him? Will he not think those words of evil omen fulfilled? But enough, Fitz, how did you leave my fair captive?"</p> 
                  <p>"I left her recovered from her swoon, but overwhelmed with the deepest grief,"answered he.</p> 
                  <p>"That, of course, was to be expected,"said Seymour, in a light and heartless voice. "Fitz, what if I visit her to-night, and make myself known?"</p> 
                  <p>"It were not best, I think; wait till her grief somewhat subsides; to-morrow, or it were better if you would wait longer. To reveal yourself while grief bends her soul nearly to despair, would be a greater shock than her nerves could sustain. Be not now too rash, and foil yourself, Seymour. Leave it to me; I will prepare her mind to receive you, that your first visit shall not be an unwelcome one. That it shall be wholly unattended by the slightest fear or shrinking on her part, which your presence might otherwise produce. I will tell her of your love; the first, warm, passionate love you bore her. I will tell her it was love unrequited, rejected, that made you what you are. I will tell her that within your breast love yet burns as brightly for her, as when rejected first. That if she will but consent to be yours, you renounce from that moment the life you now lead, and devote yourself wholly at the shrine of love, and live but to contribute to her happiness. I will tell her all this, Seymour, and if I do not succeed in getting you into her favor, why, then you can take your own course; she is in your power."</p> 
                  <p>"Tell her of my wealth, Fitz; gold is a talisman seldom rejected."</p> 
                  <p>"I will speak of your wealth. Gold has a powerful charm, I know. It has turned the heads of kings. Priests have sold their faith for gold. It has bought religious converts. It has triumphed over honor. Friendship is but its monitor. Truth has yielded to its irresistible charm. It has turned justice from its course. It has shut the eye of the law ere now. It has compromised the darkest crimes. Gold has done all this, but it never bought the love of woman."</p> 
                  <p>"It has bought her hand, and her consent, ere now, Fitz,"said Seymour with a light laugh; "but I leave the management of this affair to you, for a spell, Fitz, as you request it."He turned and walked aft.</p> 
                  <p>"And I will manage to foil your hellish designs, monster!" exclaimed Fitz Alwyn to himself, as Seymour left him. "To me she owes her unhappy lot, and for her safety I will sacrifice fice my own life."</p> 
                  <p>The sun was just rising the next morn, when Seymour came on deck; he paced it several times, then descended the companion-way and stopped at the door of the cabin. He tried it-it was locked. Placing his hand against the door, he pressed firmly against it for a moment just above the small panel, which as he pressed, sank down without noise from sight. He looked for a moment through the aperture, then<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6021-00000029"/> thrust in his arm and turned the key. Replacing the panel he opened the door and entered. Clara Wildon lay asleep upon the couch before him. He stood for a moment gazing at her, then noiselessly approached to where she lay. The long, dark hair of the young girl was unbound, and fell loosely over her shoulders. Her hands were clasped across her breast, her long silken eye-lashes were moist with tears. Upon her cheek lay trembling a single tear-drop, glistening like a pearl thrown upon carnation's richest bed. Seymour gazed in silence at the lovely maiden before him; a bitter smile of triumph passed his lips.</p> 
                  <p>"She sleeps; I'll not disturb her now, but yet I will not deny myself what she would deny me."</p> 
                  <p>Bending over he imprinted upon her lips a kiss. She smiled in her sleep, and whispered the name of Warren. A sweet dream was upon her. Seymour drew back. "No, not Warren, but William!" he uttered in a bitter voice, which betrayed the unutterable hate with which he heard his brother's name. </p> 
                  <p>"Sleep on, fair maid, you are mine, sleep on. Your eyes will never again behold him. Dream on! dream you stand at the altar-his; wake, and find you are mine. Ha, ha, this is my triumph."</p> 
                  <p>Bestowing one glance more upon the sleeping maid, he left the cabin.</p> 
                  <p>Eight days passed away from the time Clara Wildon had been torn from her home, during the greater part of which time, Fitz Alwyn had been in her presence, as Seymour supposed with a view of creating in her mind an interest in his behalf. And as Fitz Alwyn had told him, he had succeeded beyond his expectations.</p> 
                  <p>"I have so wrought upon her mind," said he, "that I believe she has half-forgotten Warren, a d would, if you were to make an open and honorable offer to wed her, I believe, accept it."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you think so, Fitz? Faith, I have half-forgotten my hate, and love her again. I would wed her even now, though I had sworn when in my power, she would sue in vain for that boon. I will see her."</p> 
                  <p>"Not yet: I have gained an inch of ground in your favor, but be not over-hasty and take a foot. Wait, and I shall yet stand at your wedding."</p> 
                  <p>Thus he had kept him day after day from visiting Clara; and held him in suspense. He had informed Clara, into whose power she had fallen, of the whole villanous transaction, the success of which he had been instrumental in effecting. At her feet he had begged her forgiveness and received it. He had tried in vain to have Clara receive a visit from Seymour without betraying her abhorrence of him, as the only means of her safety. He knew that Seymour would not brook much longer delay; and would know that he had played him false. He knew he was bearding the lion in his den; but he had sworn to keep inviolable the person of Clara Wildon at the hazard of his own life. He knew that Seymour would reek his vengeance upon him in a terrible manner when assured of his treachery. But for this he was prepared. Of the seventy who formed the crew of the Black Vulture, thirty were bound to him by the most fearful oaths, in any service he required of them. He had determined, when he could no longer stay the impatience of Seymour, to fall, with the men sworn to his purpose, upon the rest of the crew, and gain the schooner, into his own hands.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
                  <p>IT was the afternoon of the eighth day-a terrible thunder storm had burst upon the Atlantic, and had raged with fearful and unabated fury for several hours. The rain fell in unceasing torrents, mingling the waters of heaven with the briny spray of the ocean waves which dashed in maddening fury, high, as if to rear their snowy-crested tops unto the blackened, frowning heavens above. The lightning was frequent, and its flashes intensely vivid. The thunder burst in fearful and incessant peals from above, and rolled heavily away.</p> 
                  <p>The pirate schooner under close-reefed topsails was driven with fearful velocity over the mountain waves; now borne on the very crest of a towering wave, high aloft; now sinking into the trough of the sea, while high above her reared the snowy crests. Yet like a feather she rode the waves, and seemed to scorn their tumultuous fury. In the cabin of the Black Vulture, upon the couch, with her face buried in her hands, and in a half-reclining posture, was Clara Wildon. She had always experienced during a thunder-storm the most abject terror, and was now more dead than alive, with fear. At every flash of lightning that lit the cabin from its two windows at the stern of the schooner, she would start, and an involuntary exclamation of fear escaped her lips. Each successive peal of thunder would send a fearful shudder through her frame. Her sufferings during that terrible storm were intense; alone, with no endearing friends around, imprisoned, and tossed upon the raging waters in that frail vessel, which every succeeding wave that bore it on, threatened with destruction. She had but thrown herself upon the couch, when suddenly at the door of the cabin was heard a loud knock. She started to her feet, but did not approach the door.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh God! if that should be him," she exclaimed, wringing her hands, while her face betrayed the wildest terror. Another knock. With a faltering step she approached the door.</p> 
                  <p>"Who is here?" she inquired with deepest agitation in her voice.</p> 
                  <p>"Fitz Alwyn," was the answer returned from without.</p> 
                  <p>Clara turned the key, and Fitz Alwyn entered. He closed the door and locked it.</p> 
                  <p>"Miss Wildon," said he advancing toward her, "I have come with words which I fear to speak."</p> 
                  <p>"Mercy! is the schooner in danger? Is it that, Fitz Alwyn?" She seized his wrist with a convulsive grasp. The tone of her voice was<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6021-00000030"/> fearful; for the words of Fitz Alwyn had created in her imagination a sudden thought of terrible nature.</p> 
                  <p>"No, it is not that,"said he, suppressing a slight smile that forced itself to his lips, at her vehement words, and look of fear with which she regarded him. "I have to tell you, Miss Wildon, that Seymour has resolved to see you. I can no longer stay him. He will be here within a few short moments. I have stayed him till now, to further a plan I have in view. For your sake I would have stayed him longer, but could not. He has resolved to see you, and I could as well withhold the hungry tiger from his prey, when he is about to spring upon it, as Seymour when he has resolved. You must see him; but in God's name, receive him with a slight assumed show of courtesy, if you value aught your life. Promise me that, Miss Wildon, for your own sake, and I will thank you."</p> 
                  <p>"Never! Fitz Alwyn.To you, for the care you manifest in my behalf, I am sincerely thankful. Your advice, given, as you gave it, for my welfare, I cannot accept. Never will I assume a falsehood, in word or in bearing. No, Fitz Alwyn, I scorn and abhor William Seymour, and with scorn and abhorrence will I greet him, though the worst should befall me."Her form dilated with excitement, and her eyes flashed with unwonted fire, as she ended. Her spirit, determined words and manner struck Fitz Alwyn with surprise. He seemed for a moment to doubt them; but a gaze at her now glowing face, a glance at her firmly closed lips convinced him her words were not merely spoken, but sealed with determination.</p> 
                  <p>"If this be your mind, if this is your resolve, may heaven protect you from the power of the pirate Seymour," said he in a voice that betrayed fear for her safety "Here, Miss Wildon, take these, they may be of service to you; quick, Seymour is already at the door."He spoke suddenly and in a hurried manner, at the same time tendering to Clara a pistol and dagger. She started back at the sight of the weapons. "Nay, take them,"said Fitz Alwyn in an earnest manner, "they will at least save you from dishonor, if you fear to use them in your defence. Conceal them quickly, in the name of heaven. If this should fail, the dagger will at least prove true,"said he as Clara took the weapons with fear and trembling.</p> 
                  <p>A slight rap was at that moment heard at the door.</p> 
                  <p>"Remember, Miss Wildon,"said Fitz Alwyn in a low tone, "I shall be near you; if he offers violence, fire the pistol; if you fear to fire upon him, fire at random. I shall hear the report which will be the signal for that which will draw his attention from you on the instant. His conduct here will determine whether he or I is the master of this vessel."</p> 
                  <p>He now approached the door and opened it. The buccaneer chief entered; a smile was upon his face. He advanced toward the trembling Clara, and knelt with one knee bended at her feet.</p> 
                  <p>"Monster! kneel not at my feet!"she exclaimed in a tone that spoke the deep scorn and loathing with which she beheld him.</p> 
                  <p>Had he knelt upon a writhing viper and felt its deadly sting at his vitals, the pirate would not have started quicker to his feet than he did at the words of the maiden before him. Mortification and rage were depicted in his face.</p> 
                  <p>"Monster! ha. This was not the appellation I had thought to receive from you, proud one," said he in a bitter tone, while a smile of fearful expression rested upon his lips. "Fitz Alwyn, how is this?" he turned but Fitz was gone. He turned to Clara; his gaze was fiend-like and fearful. He spoke in a bitter, ironical tone:</p> 
                  <p>"If you have no other term for me, proud beauty, why, call me monster; I like the term, it suits me well, as you will find it does. Let me hear it again from those pouting, ruby lips, ere I taste their sweets. Speak once more the mild term, pretty one. I see how it is,"in an altered voice, "I have been the dupe of Fitz Alwyn. But bitterly will he repent the hour he played me false."</p> 
                  <p>The dark eye of the pirate gleamed fiercely bright as he spoke, and his face was wrought with dreadful passion.</p> 
                  <p>"He has played me false; but it matters not since he and you, proud beauty, are in my power. What was his purpose, I know not, but it has availed him naught. He has wrought his doom.-You, too, shall know your fate; you are mine, and heaven nor hell shall snatch you from my grasp. Mine, in spite of earthly power, Clara Wildon."</p> 
                  <p>Terrible was the voice, and terrible the look of the buccaneer as he spoke. He advanced a step towards Clara, extending his hand as if to grasp her. She shrunk from his approach.</p> 
                  <p>"Touch me not, thou fiend in form of man! Advance one step nearer to me at your peril,"said she in a spirited voice, casting at him a look of scorn. The threatening danger of her situation had roused within her a courage to confront it, she knew not she possessed. Her eyes flashed brightly as she gazed at the fiend before her. He stood silent for a moment; her manner and words confounded him. Gazing at her for an instant, he sprang toward her, while a derisive laugh escaped his lips. Quicker than thought she drew forth from her bosom the pistol and aimed it at his breast. He sprang to its very muzzle, but quick as lightning darted back. He saw the meaning attitude of the maiden; the pistol aimed at his breast; he laughed not again. He saw she was not the easy victim he thought her. And he muttered a curse as he gazed upon her, foiled at her mercy. One movement of her finger would wing a bullet to his heart. He moved slightly.</p> 
                  <p>"Approach one step nearer me, William Seymour, and you peril your life," said Clara in a firm tone, taking a deadly aim at his breast.</p> 
                  <p>Seymour ground his teeth in rage, and his eyes flashed with hellish fire.</p> 
                  <p>"Am I to be thus baffled, and by a woman? No, by all the gods, I'll not!" he exclaimed in a voice of fury. "I dare the danger. "He made a sudden, furious spring towards her. The click of the pistol lock was heard, but the pistol missed its fire. Seymour grasped the weapon and dashed it to the floor.</p> 
                  <p>"Ha, ha, you are foiled, and are yet mine," he exclaimed with a burst of savage joy, as he grasped her form in his arms.</p> 
                  <p>She struggled in vain to free herself from his grasp, when she suddenly drew from her bosom the dagger given her by Fitz Alwyn. She raised the glittering blade above his head. He released her from his hold, and started back, but the point of-her weapon aimed with fatal precision, slightly pierced his breast and fell to the floor. At that very instant a flash of lightning, intensely vivid, lit the cabin, and the fearful light seemed to linger for a moment there. The flash was followed instantaneously by a terrific, deafening peal of thunder, as though the very heavens were rent asunder. Clara uttered an exclamation of terror, and sank almost fainting to the couch. Seymour started almost involuntarily, as though with fear. Hardly had the terrible burst of the thunderpeal smote his astounded ear, ere the cracking and rending of timber was heard, and on the instant, a fall and crash that shook the vessel to its very keel. So heavy was the crash that it seemed to rend the schooner in every joint. With a sudden bound he sprang from the cabin and darted up the companion-way to the deck. The sight that met his gaze drew from him an oath too fearful to repeat. The mainmast of the schooner had been struck by the lightning, and was shivered from its head to the deck. The long Tom was torn from its carriage, and was half buried in the deck. The bulwarks on the starboard quarter for a number of feet had been ripped up, and three of the guns lost overboard. Two men lay crushed beneath a portion of the mast. They had met with a sudden and terrible death, and their mangled bodies struck the crew with horror, as they gazed at them. Such was the scene that Seymour beheld. With an oath, he fiercely ordered, "All hand to clear the wreck." Hardly had the order died upon his lips, ere a cry from the lookout of "Sail-ho!" smote his ear.</p> 
                  <p>"Where away?"</p> 
                  <p>"To windward, on our starboard bow," was the answer returned.</p> 
               </div> 
               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6021-00000031"/> 
                  <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
                  <p>Turning his eye in that direction, Seymour discerned through the storm a schooner, with reefed topsails, bearing down and not a mile distant. He ordered a glass, and springing into the fore-rigging, levelled it at the approaching sail. He suddenly exclaimed:</p> 
                  <p>"By all the god! I should know that craft. 'Tis the Flying Arrow-my brother's. The furies seize him!" he exclaimed fiercely, as he sprang to the deck. "He is bearing down, thinking we are in danger, to offer aid, which, were I sinking, I would not accept from him. Curse this wreck; were it not for this, I would put to the test the speed of the Flying Arrow. I would leave the wake of the Black Vulture for her to plough, till her keel should wear away in pursuit. He knows not my craft-the fiends be praised for that."</p> 
                  <p>The approaching schooner was now within half of a mile, and bearing down with the wind's speed. A few moments more brought her within hailing distance; yet no voice of hail was heard. On she came dashing aside the salt spray, her bows now buried to their head in the waves, now rising, and her stern sinking in the hollow of the sea. What his brother's intention could be, the pirate chief could not conjecture. A few fathoms now only separated the two vessels.</p> 
                  <p>"Hell and furies! will he run me down!" wildly exclaimed the buccaneer, while his voice betrayed a fear as he spoke.</p> 
                  <p>The situation of the pirate schooner was critical in the extreme. The other had dashed on within a perilous proximity of the pirate, and bearing directly upon her starboard bow, threatened to run afoul. The pirate schooner, careened over by the wreck of the mainmast which had not been cleared away, obeyed not her helm, and collision seemed inevitable. Breathless anxiety pervaded all on board as they watched the other schooner.</p> 
                  <p>"Keep off, or you will sink us," shouted Seymour, in a loud, vehement voice, as at that moment the privateer was borne to the top of a wave that threatened to dash her with terrible force on to the pirate. His words came too late. Destruction seemed inevitable.</p> 
                  <p>A cry of horror burst from several of the pirates. The vessel had struck-no. When right upon them, as it seemed, the privateer was laid, by a skilful manuvre, broadside with the pirate, her stern with the bows of the latter. Grappling irons were thrown from the privateer, and the vessels were in a moment bound firmly together. Before they could recover from their surprise, the deck of their vessel was crowded with threescore of privateermen. So sudden, so unexpected had been their movements, that the pirates were completely taken by surprise. But a few of them were armed sufficiently for the fierce contest that must ensue between them and their foe. But these were instantly engaged with the privateer's crew, who were formidably armed for a fierce encounter, while the others rushed precipitately aft, and hastily arming themselves, joined their fellows in the commencing fray. Seymour who had gone below when his vessel was boarded, now came on deck, with a score of followers, and rushed furiously upon the privateersmen. One loud, wild yell burst from the pirates, and the fierce, sanguinary contest began in terrible earnest. The pirates pressed upon their foes with savage fury; now receding in a body to gain impetus for a furious charge, which the privateersmen bravely encountered, and in turn pressed hotly, and with equal force upon them.</p> 
                  <p>Thus they receded alternately, like the waves of the ocean, neither gaining any apparent advantage. For half an hour the fearful carnage raged, and terribly.</p> 
                  <p>The deck was strewn with the corses of pirates and privateersmen. Dead and dying lay heaped upon the gory deck, and were trampled by the feet of the fierce combatants. Every moment increased the fierce heat of the battle, and added to the number of the wounded and slain. The storm yet raged with unabated fury, and added to the din of the carnage. The privateersmen with their commander, Warren Seymour, and his friend Almont at their head, fought bravely against their savage foes. Wherever the fight raged the fiercest, Warren was in its midst. His blade had thinned the pirate ranks of a number. He confronted danger with a courage and daring almost fatal to himself. Several times during the conflict, he had caught sight of his pirate brother, and had striven in vain to near him. To cross blades with the buccaneer, was his earnest wish. Their eyes had met and the fierce fire that blazed in those of the pirate, and the look of hatred which he cast at his brother, told that the wish of the one was the wish of the other.</p> 
                  <p>The battle still raged. The pirates fought like devils incarnate; expecting no quarter, they fought with reckless desperation and fury. They had partaken freely of rum mixed with powder, which imparted a ten-fold fury to them. Their faces steaming with gore, their eyes gleaming with unearthly fire, and the fierce yells they uttered, gave them the appearance of a troop of fierce madmen. Their ranks momentarily thinned; yet they fought on with tiger-like ferocity, asking no mercy, giving none. With an impetuosity naught could resist, fought the crew of the privateer, against those fiends in human shape.</p> 
                  <p>Among them was one who by his reckless daring had made himself the terror of the pirates, and conspicuous among those with whom he fought. Who he was, was unknown. He wore a black mask concealing his face from view. Who he was or how he came into the ranks of the privateer's crew, was a mystery to them. His unequalled daring elicited surprise from all. Seymour had noticed him among his crew; he had seen the terrible effect of the death dealing blade of the stranger. He had watched him with surprise. He had seen several of the pirates fall beneath the fatal stroke of the stranger's blade. Thrice during the fight he had hailed him, but the unknown kept aloof and fought and felled his foes. The din of battle and storm increased. The ringing and clashing of steel-the loud, incessant report of pistols-the cries of the wounded as they were trampled to the deck by friends and foes, rose in wild confusion upon the air. The fierce lightning leaped from horizon to horizon along the frowning sky, darting to and fro in zig-zag streams of liquid fire-then quenching its fiery bolts in the raging waters. The deep toned<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6021-00000032"/> thunder burst in awful peals, and rolled heavily along the frowning sky-the wind howled loudly, and the angry roar of the surging billows was continual and monotonous. The elements of fire, air and water seemed striving in fiercest war-the blackened sky seemed like a gigantic funeral pall suspended over this scene of Nature's wildest commotion, and fiercest human strife. The deadly combat yet holds fiercely on. Neither of the opposing foes do yield. Victory hangs suspended, taking sides with neither.</p> 
                  <p>Mark the combatants. See how furiously their reeking blades fall around. Their blows how terrible and fatal-the clashing steel rings upon the air. How the fire flies from their well tempered blades. Mark, the red blood follows the ensanguined blade-how the wild cry of mortal agony bursts in piercing accents above the din of battle. See how they reel-fall-how they writhe in the last fearful agonies of death. A shout. Look there. The privateersmen give way before a furious charge of the pirate horde. But it is momentary-and with a force irresistible, in turn, drive back their demon like foes, and pile their corses upon the gory deck. Another shout rings out upon the air. The privateersmen gain-conquer-they press hotly upon their savage foes, driving them forward to the very bows of the vessel They yield. Look!-The rival chiefs have met-the buccaneer and privateersman-face to face the brothers stand. One moment and their weapons cross, clash. Again they cross, now raised high, descend with terrible force; edge meets edge, and again resounds the clash of their weapons. The battle on both sides had voluntarily ceased-the crews of both vessels watched with intense anxiety the fierce contest between their respective leaders.</p> 
                  <p>The brothers fought on. Many and fearful were the thrusts made at each other-but neither gained advantage. Both plied their weapons with equal skill and dexterity. Their forms dilate, their eyes flash fiercely bright; every nerve and muscle is brought into action, and strained with fierce excitement. But at length the thrusts and lunges of the buccaneer became more frequent and furious. With mortal hatred gleaming in his eyes, he sprung with the fury of a demon upon his brother, who now stood on the defensive. He withstood the assaults of the buccaneer with firmness and courage unyielding, and parried with coolness and dexterity the frequent and terrible passes made at him by his brother, who in his mad fury lost in a great degree, the skill with which till now he had fought, thus giving Warren the advantage.</p> 
                  <p>Of a sudden he bounded upon his brother, whom he fancied for a moment was off his guard, and aimed a terrible blow at his breast. But the ever ready blade of Warren foiled the blow, and the pirate's weapon fell ringing to the deck. With the quickness of thought he stooped to recover it; but in so doing he missed his footing upon the deck, slippery with human gore, and fell one knee upon it.</p> 
                  <p>"Now yield thee, monster, or take thy doom!" said Warren, poising above the head of the fallen pirate his heavy cutlass, "yield, monster as thou art. I would not be my brother's murderer."</p> 
                  <p>"Yield to thee! never! never!" said the buccaneer. "Strike, if you will, a fallen foe-strike deep to my heart; it were a deed that would well befit thy coward heart; strike, or if you shrink to do the deed, give me my weapon, and I'll show thee how I can be a brother's murderer."</p> 
                  <p>The bitter, taunting words of the pirate were uttered in a voice that spoke vividly the deep and deadly hatred he bore his brother.</p> 
                  <p>"Take thy weapon," said Warren, dropping his own to his side and stepping back a pace.</p> 
                  <p>"Though I give no heed to your words of bitter taunt, yet you shall have the trial over."</p> 
                  <p>The pirate grasped his weapon and sprung to his feet.</p> 
                  <p>"Remember, now," said Warren, placing himself in an attitude of defence, "it is life or death with us. Be it fair or foul I will not again spare you, nor will I ask of you to stay your hand, if you should prove the victor."</p> 
                  <p>A moment more and the brothers were again engaged in combat. It was a fearful struggle, but brought suddenly to a close. Warren, by a powerful, dexterous blow dashed aside the blade of his brother, and smote heavily upon his breast, and pressing upon him, bore him to the deck.</p> 
                  <p>"Now your time has come; brother though you are, that brother's doom I seal. But ere thy soul has fled, I would ask, though I expect no answer but what will tear afresh the agonizing would that gnaws my bleeding heart, caused by a brother's deed, I would ask of you what of her whom you so foully tore from her home? speak! relieve thy soul of one dark, guilty deed. I would know her fate."</p> 
                  <p>"Thou shalt know. You shall have my answer," said the buccaneer, writhing beneath the foot of his brother, planted firmly upon his breast, "you shall know her fate. I would see how well your nerves could meet the shock. Know, then, that she of whom you speak is lost to you forever. She is thy brother's mistress. A foul, dishonored woman; corrupted by one who hated her and thee, to gratify revenge. Ha! ha! ha! I swore revenge, and living, I attained it; and dying, I have revenge gazing at thee."</p> 
                  <p>"And I will avenge her, fiend," cried Warren, raising for the death blow, his weapon above his brother's head.</p> 
                  <p>The words of his brother fell terribly upon him; his nerves received a fearful shock.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER X.</head> 
                  <p>FOR a moment he poised the weapon in the air; the pirate writhed in agony; he knew his doom was sealed; the blade descended, but thrust between it and the pirate's breast was another blade. Quicker than lightning the pirate sprang to his feet, again respited. Warren was thrust aside at the moment, and between him and the buccaneer stood another form.</p> 
                  <p>Mark the pirate's cheek, now bursting, red with rage. See! it blanches to the ghastly hue of death. The color's fled his lips; they quiver. His eyes are fixed in a frightful stare upon the form before him. He speaks-wildly-in accents of mortal fear that come deep from his soul.</p> 
                  <p>"Does the sea give back its dead? Art thou form of flesh and blood, or a phantom come to mock at me?"</p> 
                  <p>"I am flesh and blood, no phantom!" was answered in a voice deep and thrilling. "Ha, ha," wildly laughed the form. "You are mine, mine only, for vengeance! I have lived, prayed for this-this moment-it has come. For the worst of deaths you doomed me, I escaped to live for vengeance. For wealth thegreatest; for honorthe highest; for fame the noblest; no-not for the proudest kingdom on the globe would I barter this moment of revenge that is mine. Take up thy blade and couldst thou invoke the powers of darkness to thy aid, and clothe thy weapon with all their power, I would foil the charm."</p> 
                  <p>He who was now the pirate's foe, and who spoke so terribly, was Edmund Elmore. The pirate grasped his weapon and the next moment it was crossed with that of his foe. Fearful is the clash of their weapons; fierce and deadly is the struggle. Thrice the blade of the pirate rang upon the deck, dashed from his hand.-As it fell the third time, Elmore whirled his high in the air, it fell, and the two lay crossed on the deck. More sudden than the lightning's flash upon the buccaneer he sprang. One arm he winds with a convulsive iron grasp round his waist-his right hand is upon his throat; how hard he presses, how he gasps for breath; he staggers.</p> 
                  <p>"Come with me, fiend, to the ocean depths below," said a terrible voice.</p> 
                  <p>Two forms dashed through the air and fell into the maddened waves-a wild hysterical laugh broke loud above the storm, then died away. Again it was repeated, and again; thrice, as the two forms rose to the surface of the waves-they sink for the last time. The raging billows now close over them forever-the doomed, and the avenger. Such was the terrible revenge of Edmund Elmore. This sudden, terrible mode of revenge thrilled for a moment all on board with horror.</p> 
                  <p>But ha-what is that? is it smoke that rises from the hatches?-it is."The schooner is on fire!" were the thrilling words uttered by a dozen voices.</p> 
                  <p>There was a rush for the deck of the privateer. From the companion way of the pirate schooner a column of black and'stifling smoke rolls fiercely upward. A moment more and it is pierced by the red flame as it shoots from below. Fearful mush have been the progress of the flames.</p> 
                  <p>"My daughter, she is not saved!" exclaimed a voice, in startling accents.</p> 
                  <p>Wringing his hands in agony of despair, Mr. Wildon sprang upon the pirate's deck. "Good heavens! it is too late! Oh God! must she die thus?"</p> 
                  <p>A form rushed past him; sprang down the companion-way-it was he who wore a black mask upon his face. An involuntary thrill of horror shot through the hearts of all who saw the form disapppear down the passage to inevitable destruction. Clara Wildon had paced the cabin floor in breathless trepidation during the time the battle lasted. Clara had been informed by Fitz Alwyn that it was her lover who had given fight to the pirate. Although cheered with the hope that her lover would prove victor by Fitz Alwyn, who had come to the cabin several times during the battle, yet a fearful anxiety pervaded her soul, as she thought how the battle might turn.</p> 
                  <p>"The fight is ended; why does he not come? Oh God! if the pirate has triumphed," said Clara, in a tone of apprehension.</p> 
                  <p>A moment more and the door was burst open, and he who wore the black mask stood before her. "Come lady, we must quickly leave this place. No, not there, the flames have cut us off The window, the window! 'tis our only way of escape. Follow me," and as he spoke the flames burst into the cabin. He dashed open the window and let himself out, till he hung by one arm over the furious waves, which dashed him several times with violence against the schooner's stern. With fear and trembling, Clara emerged through the window. Her form was half way out; her head swam. Entwining his right arm around her waist, her preserver and herself dropped-the roaring waves received their forms, and for a moment closed over them.</p> 
                  <p>When it was found the flames could not be subdued, the privateer was cast free from the pirate, yet there remained upon her deck, Warren Seymour, Almont and Mr. Wildon.</p> 
                  <p>"In the name of heaven, leave this vessel," said Almont, grasping the arm of Mr. Wildon: "'tis madness to remain here longer. Leave, oh leave, I pray you, I beseech you."</p> 
                  <p>"Away, away," said the father, "I will not go. I will perish with my daughter;" and he tore himself from the young man.</p> 
                  <p>Almont turned to Seymour.</p> 
                  <p>"Warren, if you love me, in God's name leave this vessel. With your aid we can get him into the boat. Fly, ere it is too late. Ha, what is that? Look, those forms, they again appear. One is a woman. She is saved! Thank God! your daughter is saved!</p> 
                  <p>The words of young Almont were uttered in a voice of rapture. Mr. Wildon and Warren turned their gaze in the direction Almont pointed, and they saw two forms tossed upon the waves. Almont and Warren leaped into the boat, and with a wild cry of joy Mr. Wildon followed, and exclaimed, "We can save them." The boat pushed from the burning vessel, and in a few moments, Clara Wildon and he who had so nobly striven to save her, were rescued, and in as short a space of time the boat had reached the privateer. As soon as they reached the deck, the unknown stranger sank exhausted; the black mask fell from his face, and<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6021-00000034"/> exposed the features of Fitz Alwyn. He was carried to the cabin; it was an hour ere he recovered.Then he started up from the couch, exclaiming,</p> 
                  <p>"Oh God! I am dying!"He grasped the hands of warren and Clara, and said, "Forgive, oh forgive me, lady, for the foul wrong I have done you, and I die relieved. You too forgive me, Warren?I have wronged you both. Let me know I am forgiven and I die happy."</p> 
                  <p>His breathing became heavy and difficult; the seal of death was upon his brow; he sank back upon the couch; one convulsive start, one piercing exclamation of agony and death closed his sufferings; but not until he received the full forgiveness of those he had wronged. He had worn the mask during the fight that the pirates might not know him.</p> 
                  <p>It was but a few minutes after Fitz Alwyn had been conveyed on board the privateer, that the fierce flames had burst above the deck of the pirate craft. One by one her guns had bursted from the intense heat, and their thunder sound boomed far over the waters.-What few of the pirates had escaped the fearful carnage, had betaken themselves on the first discovery of fire, to a boat and put off. The boat was not six times her length from the schooner, when she swamped in the heavy sea and every one on board found a watery grave.</p> 
                  <p>It was a sight thrilling to the blood, to behold the burning vessel tossed by the mad waves to and fro; the flaming mass relieved against the blackened sky with intense brightness; the flames have now licked up the foremast, wreathing round and round like a fiery serpent, to its very head. Now they wrap the yards in their embrace, and shoot forth a thousand forked tongues of flame in every direction. The fore and fore-top yards fell, and the mast with the top-gallant yard now stands a cross of flaming fire. A moment more, and it falls to the deck, when at the same instant, ten thousand burning fragments are hurled high in the air, and fall extinguished in the waves. The schooner had blown up. Naught now remained of her once beautiful hull, but the blackened fragments, that strewed the sea.</p> 
                  <p>The sun was two hours risen on the following morning, when Fitz Alwyn was consigned to the grave of the sailor-the ocean wave. Not an eye but wept at the burial of him, who had sacrificed his life in atonement for a deed he could not forgive himself.</p> 
                  <p>In a few words we will account for the appearance of Edmund Elmore on board the pirate craft. Cast adrift by the pirate crew, he was tossed three days and nights upon the sea, when he was picked up by a vessel, and thus snatched from the jaws of death. He was the same young man who had boarded the Flying Arrow, when she was about to leave in pursuit of the Black Vulture; and whom we alluded to at the close of the "Rival Brothers."</p> 
                  <p>The privateer now held on her way to Boston with happy hearts aboard, where she arrived in safety. One year afterward, in the mansion of Mr. Wildon, a bridal took place-the bride and bridegroom were CLARA WILDON and WARREN SEYMOUR.</p>

               <head>AN ITALIAN DUEL.</head> 
               <head type="sub">[FROM THE FLAG OF OUR UNION.]</head> 
               <head type="sub">BY FRANCIS A. DURIVAGE.</head> 
               <p>TWO men were seated in a vine-covered arbor, their elbows resting on a rustic table, smoking perfumed cigarettas. The elder, who seemed to be about forty, was tall and pale; his rich but simple attire was grave and somewhat military; as for the younger, he was chiefly remarkable for the careless elegance then so much the mode in Italy as well as France. It was he who resumed the conversation which had evidently been suspended for some minutes.</p> 
               <p>"'Faith, my dear Alfieri,"said he, delicately shaking the ashes from his cigarette, "I did not expect the pleasure of meeting you when I came to the waters of Abano."</p> 
               <p>"Yet it is the place for an invalid."</p> 
               <p>The young man looked at the count.</p> 
               <p>"Well," replied he, "I do indeed find you altered; you are paler than common. Have you consulted the physicians?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"What did they tell you?"</p> 
               <p>"What they always tell me. In the winter they promise my cure the next summer; in the summer they promise it for the winter. The doctors of Milan recommend the air of Naples, and the doctors of Naples the air of Milan. I take their advice. I do what they please-and I am quietly ending my life."</p> 
               <p>"What an idea! as if people died at your age!"</p> 
               <p>"Sometimes," murmured Alfieri, with a pensive air, as he lowered his head.</p> 
               <p>"By Jove! I have it!" cried the young man; "I'll wager that you are thinking of the prediction of your old sorceress."</p> 
               <p>"Am I wrong, Celini?I was but twelve years old when this woman foretold what has since happened to me. She warned me that I should leave Piedmont-that I should become a poet-and that my name would be celebrated."</p> 
               <p>"And that you would die at thirty-five. Who is not familiar with this story? You have written an admirable sonnet on this prophecy which all Italy knows by heart. But what of it?you have too much sense to be superstitious."</p> 
               <p>The count sighed without replying, and there was a momentary silence.</p> 
               <p>"Would you know what is killing you?"<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6021-00000035"/> resumed Celini. "It is your isolation; you are not really sick.."</p> 
               <p>"The physicians have already told me so," replied the count, smiling; "and I know that I shall die in very good health."</p> 
               <p>"Why don't you seek diversion? When you left Milan, you spoke of travelling. I thought you were in Spain?"</p> 
               <p>"I have just come from Spain."</p> 
               <p>"Well-you were to visit France."</p> 
               <p>"I have just come from France."</p> 
               <p>"Germany."</p> 
               <p>"I have just returned from Germany." Celini looked at him attentively.</p> 
               <p>"You have just returned from everywhere," cried he. "In fact, I remember that you are an expeditious traveller; you visit countries at full gallop. But you can't have seen anything."</p> 
               <p>"I beg your pardon; I have seen mountains, roads, cities, and in the midst of all, many men very busy in doing nothing."</p> 
               <p>"And what did you remark?"</p> 
               <p>"Three very fine institutions-the schlague in Germany, the police in France, and the Inquisition in Spain."</p> 
               <p>"You will always be the same," said Celini, laughing; "a misanthrope and republican; a true descendant of Brutus, though a subject of the Pope."</p> 
               <p>Then, assuming a more serious tone, he continued: "Do you know, Alfieri, that you do not deserve the favors which fortune has showered on you? All our theatres ring with your triumphs; all Italy is gazing on you; you are noble, rich, still young, and you seem discontented with life. What more can you desire to make you happy?"</p> 
               <p>"Who knows? something, perhaps, possessed by the humblest of those who gaze on me amid the crowd; an obscure happiness-a cottage hidden in the trees, and a beloved wife seated by my side."</p> 
               <p>"And what prevents your having this?"</p> 
               <p>Alfieri slightly shrugged his shoulders and sighed.</p> 
               <p>"You forget that chance has made me a celebrated man," said he, "and a celebrated man is a rare monster that everybody must see. It is in vain I seek obscurity; I must live perpetually in the eye of day, and an exhibition. All the world thinks it has a right to look into the very heart of my existence; my books are like lacqueys, which constantly cry out my name before me. As soon as I appear, good-by to free converse. Each one rises on tiptoe to see me over his neighbor's shoulder. In my presence, the women are silent from fear, or attitudinize from vanity; and you know, besides, Celini, that, brought up in the heart of the mountains (for a long time a stranger to the world), I carry into society an embarrassed sadness. All these looks bent on me annoy me, and cause me pain; unable to distinguish true sympathy from curiosity, I hold myself apart and am silent. They think me haughty when I am only unhappy. Ah! when poor and obscure, I could believe in the interest which was shown me, while now I always doubt the sincerity of an attachment; and I never know whether it is myself or my position which is <unclear>envied."</unclear>
               </p> 
               <p>'I understand; you are as unhappy as a king."</p> 
               <p>"You are jesting; but it is the truth. When I came hither, I thought to escape these annoyances. For some days I was able to live like all the world, a free and simple life, when the arrival of a man, who had seen me, I know not where, destroyed everything."</p> 
               <p>"See the injustice of fortune," cried Celini. "Your celebrity annoys you, and I, in spite of all my endeavors, am buried to the ears in obscurity."</p> 
               <p>"It is your own fault; you undertake nothing seriously."</p> 
               <p>"That's <emph>your</emph> opinion! Do you forget that I am in the pay of a stage manager, and have to furnish three witty acts every month? You don't know what the stage is, my dear fellow; a sort of wine-shop, where your wits are kept on tap."</p> 
               <p>"At the risk of running down to the lees."</p> 
               <p>"That's exactly my case. I have lived a long while on a dozen ideas. You know one idea can be presented in a thousand shapes; you put the beginning at the end, the middle at the beginning, and the people call you prolific. I went on so for three years, but at last, they saw I gave them turned cloth for new, and then-would you believe it? they hissed at me."</p> 
               <p>"And what did you do?"</p> 
               <p>"Egad! when I saw it was absolutely necessary to find something new, I determined to travel to renew my inspiration, and look out for subjects. So you see, my dear count, it is not I, but the Milan theatre which is unwell, and taking the waters to recover its health."</p> 
               <p>"And do you think this process will succeed?"</p> 
               <p>"I am sure of it. There is a crowd at Abano, and I cannot fail to meet original characters, to hear anecdotes, and discover intrigues. Fifty comedies, and as many dramas are acted here every day. The deuce is in it if I can't fathom some of them. So that I think of adopting the true part of a spy."</p> 
               <p>"Have you found out anything yet?"</p> 
               <p>"You may laugh-because I only arrived yesterday. What if I should tell you I am already on the track of an intrigue?"</p> 
               <p>Alfieri made a gesture of incredulity.</p> 
               <p>"Listen," said Celini, lowering his voice.</p> 
               <p>"Yesterday, very late, unable to sleep on account of the fatigue of my journey, I went down to the garden. You know the little pavilion at the end of it?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"Well-I had just got there, and was peeping beyond, when I heard either a door or a window suddenly shut. I turned, and found myself face to face with an unknown person."</p> 
               <p>"Go on."</p> 
               <p>"At sight of me, he stopped short, made a movement as if to address me, then seemed to change his mind, turned his back on me, and disappeared."</p> 
               <p>"Did you see his features?"</p> 
               <p>"As clearly as I see yours; it was a broad moonlight."</p> 
               <p>"Then you could recognize him?"</p> 
               <p>"I have already done so."</p> 
               <p>"How?"</p> 
               <p>"This morning I found him among the bathers."</p> 
               <p>"Do you know his name?"</p> 
               <p>"He is called Marliano." The count sprang up from his seat.</p> 
               <p>"Are you sure he came out of the pavilion?" he cried.</p> 
               <p>"I cannot affirm it-but it might have been so."</p> 
               <p>"And it was on the verge of the garden, near the poplar-trees, that you met him?"</p> 
               <p>"Under the windows of the marchioness d'Alcanzo."</p> 
               <p>Alfieri turned pale; his lips trembled convulsively, but he almost immediately mastered his emotion, and resumed his seat.</p> 
               <p>"You see that I have lost no time," continued Celini, who, entirely absorbed in his narrative, had not noticed the count's agitation. "I am on the track of a love affair, which may furnish me some excellent scenes. I had already noticed this Marliano for his ugliness; he has the air of a low thief. And seeing him follow the marchioness everywhere, who seems as if she could not endure him, I thought at first he was her husband. But I have been undeceived. This is a mystery you must help me to unravel."</p> 
               <p>It was one, indeed; but it was not the first time the count had sought an explanation of it. Celini was far from suspecting all the interest this mystery had for him, and into what anguish his story had just thrown him.</p> 
               <p>The Marchioness d'Alcanzo had arrived at Abano about three months before, alone and unwell. Alfieri had then affected to avoid her, and had neglected no opportunity of displaying his reserve; but the young widow seemed to make it a point to destroy the prejudices whose motives she was ignorant of. Consequently, the coldness of the count insensibly gave way to a benevolent kindness, then to an intimacy which became daily more familiar. It was the first time that he found the graces of a woman ennobled by an intelligence of which she seemed herself unconscious. Pleasant relations was soon established between the marchioness and himself. He soon felt that she had entered his<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6021-00000036"/> life, and was becoming the most precious part of it.</p> 
               <p>He was, doubtless, on the eve of confessing thus much, when Marliano arrived. At the sight of him, Bianca appeared to be disturbed; she received him with disguised terror; there ensued between them a silent struggle, from which the young widow issued, vanquished, and subdued.</p> 
               <p>Alfieri perceived that from this time she avoided him. One would have thought that this Marliano exercised a jealous supervision over her, to which she reluctantly submitted. What were the rights of this man? Alfieri knew not. If he were the lover of the marchioness, why did she seem to fear him? If a stranger to her, why did she seem to obey him? The count had in vain risked a few questions; she had refused all explanation. For the fifteen days which had elapsed since Marliano's arrival, nothing had revealed his true position with regard to Bianca. Celini's story seemed, at first blush, to dispel all doubts; but the count only believed it for an instant. His heart revolted against an injurious supposition, and he preferred mystery to suspicion.</p> 
               <p>Still, a heart-rending anxiety remained; to believe in the truth of a beloved object is not enough; it must not be discussed mentally. Then, who was this Marliano? What ground was there for fear or hope? A first examination showed him to be only one of those commonplace idlers who spend their lives in worldly frivolities and dissipations; but, with more attention, you soon discovered under this light covering a violent tenacity; he was evidently a man of ordinary and ignoble mind, sustained by an iron will. Alfieri had in vain attempted to sound this obscure soul to a greater depth; the Genoese had shrouded himself in an icy politeness which arrested him. The marchioness, besides, rarely permitted interviews which she seemed to dread, and which she always had the address to break off.</p> 
               <p>Matters were in this state when, one day, the count, coming down to the garden, earlier than usual, encountered the young widow, seated under the trellice.</p> 
               <p>It was the first time, since the arrival of Marliano, that he had found her alone; he resolved to profit by it. On seeing him, Bianca blushed, and Alfieri apologized for having disturbed her solitude. The conversation languished at first, and, finally, after some embarrassing turns, the count stopped abruptly, and, taking the marchioness's hand:</p> 
               <p>"What have you against me?" he asked, suddenly, "and why do you avoid me?"</p> 
               <p>The marchioness started.</p> 
               <p>"I! avoid you!" repeated she. "What could make you think so?"</p> 
               <p>"Think you that I am blind, madam? This is the first time I have been able to see and speak with you for a fortnight."</p> 
               <p>The marchioness, disconcerted for a moment, instantly recovered her self-possession.</p> 
               <p>"Are you very sure that the fault is mine?" she asked, with a smile. "We often meet only those we seek."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, madam, you cannot question my eagerness."</p> 
               <p>"Why so? I know how much my arrival at Abano may have disconcerted you at first; it required some days of intimacy to remove your prejudices."</p> 
               <p>The count blushed, and tried to defend himself.</p> 
               <p>"O, do not deny it," continued the marchioness. "Your conduct was reported to me. I knew that the necessity of waiting for some tellers alone compelled you to submit to my presence."</p> 
               <p>"I know not who could have informed you of these details, madam," said Alfieri, with noble simplicity; "but I know no more how to deny my faults than to hide my thoughts. It is true that, at the first moment, your name awakened a painful emotion in me which I did not seek to conceal. But if that, madam, is the cause of the coolness which, within a few days, has succeeded to your kindness, you are very cruelly punishing the prejudices which your presence was sufficient to dispel."</p> 
               <p>"And may I know what these prejudices were, sir?"</p> 
                
               <p>"To refuse to explain them, madam, would be to make you believe I entertained some injurious repugnance. When you came, I wished to leave, because the sight of you awakened a very painful reminiscence."</p> 
               <p>"What was it, sir?"</p> 
               <p>"That of an old classmate, madam, with whom I grew up, and whom I loved as we love in childhood, from a community of age and joyousness. We had parted for a long time without having forgotten each other. I think that he was living happily at Genoa; mutual friends sent me news of him from time to time. About a year ago I learned that he loved a beautiful, noble, and much courted woman; I wrote him twice without receiving any answer. At last I received a letter from his mother-his love had been fatal to him-arival had slain him."</p> 
               <p>"And your friend's name?" asked the marchioness.</p> 
               <p>"Julio Aldi."</p> 
               <p>On hearing this name the marchioness uttered a shriek.</p> 
               <p>"It was then I heard your name pronounced for the first time," continued Alfieri.</p> 
               <p>And seeing that the lady had hidden her face in her hands:</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me, madam," said Alfieri, in a tone of emotion and supplication, "I have awakened a painful memory-but I was compelled to do so. Now you will understand why I wished for a moment to avoid an encounter which reminded me of the loss of a friend."</p> 
               <p>"Good heaven!" cried the marchioness, sobbing, "you must have hated me."</p> 
               <p>"Do not think it, madam. I know that you did everything to prevent this duel, of which you were the innocent cause-that you even hastened to the place of meeting."</p> 
               <p>"Too late! too late!" cried the marchioness, wringing her hands.</p> 
               <p>"The fault was not yours," continued Alfieri, "and Aldi's mother herself did you justice. It was not you whom she accused in her grief, madam, whom a mad temerity had cast upon the ever-lifted sword of this Baron de Rocca. Ah! how many times have I myself condemned him for having thus voluntarily exposed to the chances of a duel, a life so full of promise for the future. I knew not then what rage jealousy may inspire; I knew not how painful it was to behold beside a beloved face another face whose tranquillity insults your anguish; to hear everywhere mingled with the accents of the well-known voice, another voice familiarly replying. Now I understand why Aldi preferred an almost certain death to these tortures; for I, a man of thought and revery, who never touched a sword, I have felt for some days the thirst of battle; twenty times, a defiance has risen to my lips, and I wished to find an arm at hand, to purchase, at the peril of my life, the privilege of loving without a rival."</p> 
               <p>Alfieri had raised his voice, his pale visage shone, and as he uttered these last words, he had stretched forth his hand as if it grasped a sword. The marchioness made an involuntary movement to arrest it.</p> 
               <p>"O, fear nothing," replied he, with a bitter smile. "I have thrust back my anger to the bottom of my heart. What right have I to constitute myself the rival of any one? Jealousy is only permitted to him who can inspire love. And yet," added he, after a brief silence, "what had I to risk in the chances of a duel? Am I not already involved in one between myself and disease? And has not the issue been foretold?"</p> 
               <p>The young marchioness, who had sat with her eyes lowered, lifted them suddenly on Alfieri, and clasped her hands in tender grief.</p> 
               <p>"Still these sad thoughts!" said she. "Why will you not hope?"</p> 
               <p>"I am suffering," replied Alfieri, in a sombre voice.</p> 
               <p>The marchioness insensibly drew nearer to him. Her eyes were fixed on the altered features of the poet, with indescribable anxiety, and she said, in a trembling and subdued voice:</p> 
               <p>"Good heaven! what is the matter with you?"</p> 
               <p>"Do you ask me?" said Alfieri. "Ah, know you not what my malady is, and what is requisite to cure me? Nothing but a little affection, which would give the desire and the joy"<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6021-00000037"/> of living? For a moment I thought that I had found it; my blood no longer burned my veins; I breathed at ease-I felt myself growing young and strong, because I was growing happy! All this lasted but a few days-and I soon saw that my hope was vain."</p> 
               <p>"How know you that?"</p> 
               <p>These words had been murmured rather than pronounced; yet the count heard them, and seizing the hand of the young woman:</p> 
               <p>"Bianca!" he cried, "have I heard aright? For mercy's sake, go on! go on!"</p> 
               <p>The marchioness was about to reply; but suddenly she uttered a low cry of affright, and disengaged herself from his clasp.</p> 
               <p>The count raised his eyes. Marliano was standing at the entrance of the bower.</p> 
               <p>He bowed coldly. On seeing him, the marchioness had sunk rather than seated herself on the bench of the arbor. He approached her, without seeming to notice her emotion, and inquired after her health with imperturbable politeness.</p> 
               <p>As for Alfieri, the arrival of this man at the moment when he was about to hear a confession so long desired, had at first provoked a gesture of anger, but his whole attention was soon directed to Bianca, whose troubled looks seemed to be supplicating Marliano.</p> 
               <p>The confidential interview in which they had been surprised by the latter, could not indeed justify such an emotion; what mattered it, after all, that he had seen their hands pressed together, even had he guessed the subject of their conversation! Alfieri's love had nothing which could injure Bianca: had not both of them the right to control their destinies? There must be some mystery between them to cause the marchioness to tremble before this man. Alfieri felt all his doubts revive-an invincible instinct revealed to him a rival in Marliano, and he resolved to do all in his power to verify his suspicions. Bianca recovered herself a little, though she continued, from time to time, to cast an uneasy look on the Genoese. Alfieri observed to her that it was the hour for repairing to the well, and proposed to escort her thither.</p> 
               <p>"I thank you, sir," replied the marchioness, in a constrained manner, "but I shall remain here. Do not, however, let it interfere with your plans."</p> 
               <p>"My plans are yours, madam," said the count. "You know that the only pleasant hours of my life are those I pass with you."</p> 
               <p>"The count, I perceive, succeeds as well in madrigal as in tragedy," replied the marchioness, with an effort.</p> 
               <p>Alfieri gravely shook his head.</p> 
               <p>"Do not give a jesting title to a sentiment which you know to be sincere," said he. "You cannot have misunderstood the change your presence has effected in me, madam. Before knowing you, I was unhappy, discouraged, and fatigued with having my sadness surrounded by that vain rumor which men call glory. I saw you, and sadness, fatigue, all have disappeared. Your influence on me is like the sunlight, and you have revived the life within me."</p> 
               <p>"Sir!" cried the marchioness, rising in terror. And she turned her frightened eyes upon Marliano-but Marliano was still calm. Alfieri had also followed all these looks and movements.</p> 
               <p>"I ask your pardon," said he, turning ton the Genoese. "Such confessions are not commonly made before witnesses-and I have doubtless violated some rule of propriety."</p> 
               <p>Marliano bowed.</p> 
               <p>"I must esteem myself happy," said he "to have inspired the count with confidence enough to open his heart before me."</p> 
               <p>"I am rejoiced, in fact, sir," replied the count, "that you heard me."</p> 
               <p>"I am the person to be congratulated," replied Marliano. "A great poet, in depicting his passion, possesses an eloquence one would vainly seek in their hearts."</p> 
               <p>The irony with which these words were uttered was so cold, that it produced on Alfieri the effect of those wounds which are not felt at first; but no sooner had he understood it; than a thrill of rage passed through all his veins, and his eyes met those of Marliano. Bianca advanced hastily and threw herself between the two fierce glances in which they exchanged their hatred.</p> 
                
               <p>"Enough of pleasantry," said she. "Count, I hold you acquitted of all gallantry; but I would not have you, for my sake, miss your accustomed visit to the well to-day; you shall bring me a bouquet of wild mallow."</p> 
               <p>The count hesitated, but the eyes of the young woman implored him. He struggled with himself, made a constrained bow and departed.</p> 
               <p>Marliano wished to follow him.</p> 
               <p>"Signor Marliano," cried the marchioness, "you promised to read to me."</p> 
               <p>The Genoese turned towards her; a strange smile wreathed his lips. "You are very much afraid of me," said he.</p> 
               <p>Bianca pressed her hand to her heart, and seated herself without the power of replying.</p> 
               <p>"Still you ought to be satisfied with me, signora," continued Marliano, in a bitter tone. "I allowed him to speak of his love to you. I suffered his insults-for he intended to insult me-I showed him patience enough to make him think me a coward; is not that enough for you?"</p> 
               <p>"I must go," cried the marchioness, in a tone of anguish. "I cannot remain here longer. I wish to return to Genoa."</p> 
               <p>"I am ready."</p> 
               <p>Bianca cast a look on Marliano, in which indignation was mingled with affright.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," repeated she, "I return to Genoa; but to renounce the world. I have thought of it often-and my course is taken. I wish to retire to a convent."</p> 
               <p>Marliano made a sudden gesture.</p> 
               <p>"What say you, signora?" cried he. "You! Enter a convent!"</p> 
               <p>"I am resolved on it."</p> 
               <p>"Impossible! you would not, so young, so beautiful, bury yourself in an eternal prison?"</p> 
               <p>"Am I freer, now?"</p> 
               <p>The Genoese gazed on her intently.</p> 
               <p>"So," said he, sadly, "it is to avoid me that you fly from the world; you hate me more than you love its joys."</p> 
               <p>"And even were it so, have I not reason to do so?"</p> 
               <p>And she went on vehemently to depict the terrors with which the fatal passion of Marliano had environed her, the fact that for a man to love her was his death warrant, for Marliano brooked no rival. The latter attempted to defend himself, but in vain. Finally it was agreed that the marchioness should leave on the morrow for Genoa, and they left the garden together. Celini had been a concealed witness of their interview, and reported it to Alfieri. The intelligence of the exact relation subsisting between the parties-the tyranny of Marliano, the despair of the marchioness, threw him into a strange commotion, and he resolved to break her fetters or perish in the attempt. He knew that to provoke a quarrel with Marliano was to rush upon almost certain death. Yet he resolved to brave all, and in this humor, parted with his friend, promising to see him again in the evening.</p> 
               <p>Alfieri employed the succeeding hours in regulating his affairs, and writing out his last wishes. Then there rushed back upon his mind the earlier scenes of his life, the mountains where he had passed his infancy, his first emotions, his first verses, the predictions of the aged sibyl which seemed about to be accomplished. He afterwards examined his papers, separating his finished compositions, and casting a sad look upon those dearer works, which, only projected, have not yet proved the impotence of genius. O, what dreams commenced, what glimpses of inspiration then returned to his memory! How many times his hand was raised convulsively to his brow, as of to pluck from it those treasures of thought which were about to perish with him! For such is the thirst of perpetuity in man that he cannot resolve to carry away with his an unuttered thought; he feels that all there is of intelligence in him is the legacy of humanity, and that to retain aught of it is a theft.</p> 
               <p>But time passed; the count rapidly finished putting everything in order; he wrote to his sister, bade a silent adieu to all that he had loved, and descended to the saloon.</p> 
               <p>He found Celini and Marliano alone.</p> 
               <p>Celini was praising a work which he held in his hand.</p> 
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6021-00000038"/> 
               <p>"I am not acquainted with it," said Marliano, coolly.</p> 
               <p>"Should you like to read it?" asked the young man, offering it to him.</p> 
               <p>"I never read."</p> 
               <p>Celini looked at him with astonishment. It was the time of that intellectual ardor which signalized the commencement of the century-particularly with the nobility who had made a fashionable affair of it,-the reign of pamphlets and social discussions; so that a gentleman who declared he did not read, seemed as extraordinary as a seigneur of the regency, who should have declared that he did not love. The count, who had just entered, remarked Celini's surprise.</p> 
               <p>"Signor Marliano is right," said he. "What can books teach well-bred people?"</p> 
               <p>Marliano looked at him, as if to be certain he was jesting; but his features were so calm that he did not know what to think.</p> 
               <p>"Then, my dear count," replied Celini, laughing, "you ought not to worry your eyes by reading every night."</p> 
               <p>"O, with me it is quite different," replied the count. "I am a poet-a madman. I love Plutarch. I make a serious affair of such ridiculous words as the country and liberty; I would have equal rights for all, and not deliver to each man, according to the chance of his birth, a patent of happiness or woe. I dream of a world where the rewards should be for the worthiest, power for the most patriotic, happiness for all. I have not common sense-while this gentleman is wise."</p> 
               <p>All this was spoken with so calm a tone, and even an accent, that it would have been difficult to question the motive. Irony lay concealed at the bottom, but it was felt, so to speak, rather than perceived.</p> 
               <p>It was one of those masked assaults, which wound the more surely since they cannot be repulsed, and which, after having irritated you by the pricking of a thousand invisible pins, lead you, necessarily, to open reprisals, which give you the part of an aggressor. Still Marliano strove to control himself. He felt that a quarrel might cost him everything, by driving the marchioness to a painful extremity, and he wished to avoid it. It was therefore in a tone of repressed impatience that he answered:</p> 
               <p>"I do not accept the praises of the count; but I leave to more skilful men than I, who assume, I believe, the name of philanthropists and philosophers, the task of re-marking the world, like a stage-play, between meals."</p> 
               <p>"What do you say of men skilled in matters of philosophy and philanthropy?" cried Alfieri. "Ah, you are too indulgent, signor. For shame! Men who wish to enlighten the human race-the wretches! who love their neighbors more than themselves, the blockheads! Skilful men are those who profit by abuses instead of fighting them; who adorn their harshness with the name of reason, gleaming some profit and some joy from every unhappiness, choice egotists who would set fire to a city to warm their hands at the blaze! These are the men who know how to live-men we ought to imitate. And it is an easy thing. Is it not the life of all well-bred persons? They ruin creditors, dishonor women as much as possible, kill a few friends in duels, and die with the reputation of perfect gentlemen."</p> 
               <p>While Alfieri was speaking, Marliano was a prey to increasing irritation. At the last words uttered by the count, he turned suddenly; then, as if he wished to avoid a quarrel at all hazards, he walked up to an arm-chair to take his hat, which he had placed there.</p> 
               <p>"I ask pardon," said Alfieri, who affected to interpret the movement immediately. "Perhaps I am wounding the signor's opinions. I should be extremely sorry to compel him to leave on my account."</p> 
               <p>Marliano tossed his hat away again.</p> 
               <p>"I leave for no man," he said, in a haughty tone.</p> 
               <p>Alfieri bowed with a vague smile. For a few moments the three gentlemen were silent. Celini, embarrassed, did not know what the count was aiming at, and the Genoese was evidently looking for some method of avoiding an explosion. He had approached the console to breathe the perfume of a few rare flowers which were exposed there, when his eyes fell upon a case of pistols which Celini had placed there on returning from shooting. He opened the case, took up a pistol, played with it, and approached the window.</p> 
               <p>"Do you like these arms?" he said, to Celini.</p> 
               <p>"Very much-they are Cosino's make."</p> 
               <p>"Will you permit me to try them?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly."</p> 
               <p>Marliano looked out of the window.</p> 
               <p>"I see a blossom, I think," said he, carelessly, "on that red camelia."</p> 
               <p>"Yonder. "It is out of reach." Marliano fired.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, signor!" exclaimed Celini.</p> 
               <p>"The flower has fallen," said the count, carelessly, who had remained at the end of the room.</p> 
               <p>"You appear to be jesting-but it is the fact."</p> 
               <p>The count smiled. He saw that the Genoese had just given him a proof of his skill, to frighten him.</p> 
               <p>"Faith, Signor Marliano," said Celini, who was still looking in the direction of the camelia, "if we ever fight, I shan't choose pistols."</p> 
               <p>"Why not?" asked Alfieri. "On account of that flower?"</p> 
               <p>"Not at all-on my own account."</p> 
               <p>"Pshaw! it is not unusual to see this astonishing dexterity disappear at the moment of danger."</p> 
               <p>Marliano started.</p> 
               <p>"I do not say this for you, signor. But the most skilful duellist cannot always sustain the look of a man of courage, and his conscience sometimes makes his hand tremble. There are even some who make a parade of their skill, to avoid a serious encounter, and who only give a proof of dexterity to dispense with a proof of courage."</p> 
               <p>"Count!" cried Marliano, springing towards Alfieri.</p> 
               <p>"Once again. I do not say this for you," repeated the latter, quietly.</p> 
               <p>"This assurance is useless," said Marliano, whose lip quivered with passion. "I know, sir count, that you would not dare to address such words to me. Poets are prudent; they only insult by allusion; they provoke only under cover of an oratorical precaution, and when one shows himself weary of their disguised insolence, they pretend not to perceive it; if need be, they even quote their infirm health, and say they are too sick to be honorable."</p> 
               <p>"You do not intend <emph>that</emph> for <emph>me</emph>," said the count, quietly.</p> 
               <p>"I leave you to judge for yourself."</p> 
               <p>"O, no," replied Alfieri; "for in that case Signor Marliano knows I might ask satisfaction of him."</p> 
               <p>"What prevents you?"</p> 
               <p>"So you recogonize that I have that right? that your insults are levelled at me? that I am insulted?"</p> 
               <p>"So be it."</p> 
               <p>Alfieri sprang to the Genoese with a bound, and seizing his hand, exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Signor! I have the choice of weapons."</p> 
               <p>"What is that to me?"</p> 
               <p>"You shall soon know."</p> 
               <p>He sprang to the console, seized Celini's pistols, and returning to Marliano, said:</p> 
               <p>"Choose."</p> 
               <p>"But one of the pistols is empty."</p> 
               <p>"The other is loaded, signor."</p> 
               <p>"What! would you fight?"</p> 
               <p>"Each man's muzzle on his adversary's breast, and God show the right!"</p> 
               <p>"Impossible!" cried Marliano.</p> 
               <p>"I beg your pardon," cried Alfieri. "I am the insulted one-you have acknowledged it; you cannot refuse unless you are a coward. The point of honor, which has served your turn so often, is against you now, Baron de Rocca!"</p> 
               <p>"You know my name!" cried the Genoese. "Enough-it is decreed that one of us shall die. Come!"</p> 
               <p>"I am ready, signor."</p> 
               <p>Both made a step to the door; Celini stopped them.</p> 
               <p>"You will not fight without seconds," said he. "Under the terms of this duel, it is impossible."</p> 
               <p>"You shall be my second," said Alfieri.</p> 
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6021-00000039"/> 
               <p>"Let the baron find another. In one hour we shall await you at the Fountain."</p> 
               <p>"I shall be there before you."</p> 
               <p>The baron and Celini went out together. Alfieri was wrapped in painful reverie, when the marchioness entered the saloon with a book in her hand. On seeing the count, she stopped short and blushed; but recovering herself almost immediately, she said, showing him her book:</p> 
               <p>"I was with you, signor, as you see."</p> 
               <p>Alfieri recognized the last volume of poetry he had published.</p> 
               <p>"Your books, count," said she, "are not like others, gossips to which we resort for diversion; they are friends with whom we share all thoughts and emotions, and from whom we cannot part."</p> 
               <p>"Therefore am I jealous, signora."</p> 
               <p>"Jealous of your books?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes-for it is they that are loved, not myself. Before knowing me, I am studied in my works, I am guessed at through my poetry, I am pictured as like the heroes I depict. Then, when they see a man like other men appear, they are astonished, and recoil, and the idol falls from the full height to which it had been elevated. You see this yourself," he added. "It is the poet that pleases you, and not the man. You love my verses, you say,-and you fly from me." "O, speak to me!" continued the count, noticing the emotion depicted in her face, and seizing her hands, and pressing them to his lips. "Why this embarrassment? You know well that I love you. If this love is not odious to you, why refuse to avow it? Why begrudge me this happiness-the last perhaps that I may ever enjoy?"</p> 
               <p>"What say you?"</p> 
               <p>"Who knows the designs of God? Know you not the fate that was predicted for me?"</p> 
               <p>"O, do not remind me of it."</p> 
               <p>"Bianca! dear Bianca! do you love me?"</p> 
               <p>"Do you ask me?" cried the blushing marchioness.</p> 
               <p>"Loved! loved!" cried the count, in ecstacy. "Now then, let my destiny be fulfilled. I have been happy."</p> 
               <p>The clock struck. The count started.</p> 
               <p>"Farewell, Bianca!" he cried, pressing her palpitating form to his breast, and imprinting a long, lingering kiss upon her brow. "Farewell, Bianca!"</p> 
               <p>And disengaging himself from her arms, he sprang from the saloon.</p> 
               <p>A fearful thought flashed like baleful lighting across the mind of the marchioness. She hastened to the garden. Alfieri was not there. She asked for Marliano. He was absent. Her heart beat as if it would break. She went up to the count's room without knowing what she did, and entered-it was empty! She rushed out on the balcony. At that moment, a pistol shot was heard. She uttered a shriek and tottered against the wall. Almost instantly Celini appeared in the garden-alley, exclaiming, "A surgeon! a surgeon!"</p> 
               <p>Bianca felt the flooring whirl beneath her feet; she stretched out her arms to support herself, and tried to leave the window; but suddenly a step sounded on the staircase, a voice was heard-the door of the room opened abruptly-it was Alfieri-safe! The duellist had at last expiated his crimes-Marliano had fallen, and the lovers were happy.</p>

               <head>THE MOTHER'S LESSON.</head> 
               <head type="sub">[FROM THE FLAG OF OUR UNION.]</head> 
               <head type="sub">BY AUSTIN C. BURDICK.</head> 
               <p>"O, BUT I will, though."</p> 
               <p>"No, no, Laura. You must not speak in that manner."</p> 
               <p>"And why not? Why, mother, to hear you talk, one would suppose that I were about to enter a nunnery instead of being married. No I tell you no husband rules me. I shall be my own mistress."</p> 
               <p>"Laura, Laura, be serious, now, and listen to me, for I can see the rock upon which your bark of happiness may be wrecked."</p> 
               <p>"But tell me, mother, would you have me the slave of a husband? Am I going to be married just for the sake of having a man to rule me? By no means. I know my rights better. He may be assured that I shall maintain all the privileges that belong to me."</p> 
               <p>"My child, you misunderstand me. You misconstrue my meaning. You know your husband becomes responsible for your support-"</p> 
               <p>"That's his own choice, isn't it?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, and he does it because he hopes he shall be happy in your society. A good husband looks for all that is kind and gentle in his wife. His home is his refuge from the cares and business of life, and there he looks for the sweet peace and content which no other spot on earth can afford, and if he find it not there, where then shall he look? O, Laura, I tremble, lest you should forget all this."</p> 
               <p>"Now mother," uttered the half thoughtless girl, "you will really provoke me. What is the use of making a mountain out of nothing?"</p> 
               <p>"Hush, Laura. Look upon what occurred last Sabbath evening. Then you betrayed a temper that made William really unhappy."</p> 
               <p>"Well, and didn't he provoke me to it?"</p> 
               <p>"No, by no means. He only wished you to wear a more suitable dress to the lecture."</p> 
               <p>"And I should like to know what business it is to him what dresses I wear?"</p> 
               <p>"A great deal, Laura. He only requested that you would wear something more around your neck and shoulders-something that would protect you against the cold; and surely a husband has a right to do that."</p> 
               <p>"Then let him wait till he is my husband, and even then I'll teach him that he mustn't expect to rule me."</p> 
               <p>"Laura, sit down here by my side, and I will tell you something that I have hither to kept from you. I will open to you. I will open to you a page in my<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6021-00000040"/> life-book that I had meant to have kept forever closed within my own heart."</p> 
               <p>The fair girl sat down by her mother's side, and looked wonderingly up.</p> 
               <p>"It is of your father, I would speak."</p> 
               <p>"He died before I can remember."</p> 
               <p>The tears gathered more thickly in the mother's eyes, and it was sometime ere she could speak, but at length she commanded her feelings, and laying her hand upon her daughter's brow she commenced:</p> 
               <p>"Laura, listen to me now, for I can hold up to you a mirror within which you shall see what may be your own future. I was scarcely eighteen when I gave my hand to James Burke. He was a man of kind feelings and a warm heart, and I know that he loved me truly and faithfully; yet his feelings were impulsive; his sense of right and wrong was keen and unmistakable, and in all his emotions he was sensitive in the extreme. He held his honor sacred, and to small things he never stooped. Let me tell you, my child, that William Withington is almost his counterpart.</p> 
               <p>"When I married my husband, I knew his disposition and feelings,-I loved him, and yet I had resolved upon no pains to meet his wishes and make his home happy. I forgot that love has its imperative duties-that the mere marriage relation may be made the most miserable on earth, instead of being the most happy. I forgot that my own happiness depended upon the happiness of my husband, and that he could not be happy unless I, too, was happy. A very small amount of cool reflection would have shown me all this, but I gave it little heed. I did not remember that the wife's dominion was the home of her husband, and that that HOME should be her earthly heaven. I only looked upon the surface of the marriage relation, and when I entered upon its duties, I only felt that I was then freed from all restraint, and that I had nothing to do but to grasp at all the transient pleasures as they flew past.</p> 
               <p>"Of course, the first few months of our married life were happy, but yet there were clouds flew across our way that should never have gathered there. At length I came to allow myself to forget some of my duties. In the presence of my husband, I was sometimes morose and sullen. He gently chided me, but I was governed by a false, wilful pride, and I would not own that I had been wrong, and I often accused him of being unfeeling towards me. He sought all in his power to make my home comfortable-my every wish was answered so far as it could be justly done.</p> 
               <p>"At length you were born. I call God to witness that I loved you most dearly, but yet your innocent cries, and your tax upon my time and care, I allowed to sometimes worry me, and when my husband would beg of me to remember the precious charge of my infant, and only smile upon its care, I met him with sullen looks and bitter words. Not long after you were born, my husband took a stand in the political field, and his talents soon placed him firmly in the respect and good will of the people. He was chosen a member of the State Assembly, and he began to devote much of his time to the duties which his fellow-citizens placed upon him. Instead of taking a pride in the talents of my husband, and lending him my aid, I only found fault because he was away from home so much.</p> 
               <p>"Once, when we were in company, a gentleman spoke to me of the high position my husband had gained, but even then I treated the idea of my husband's neglecting his business for such things with a sneer. He heard me. I knew that James had never neglected his business, and yet I said so. When we returned home he reproved me for what I had done. I was only angry. He begged of me to remember his feelings. I laughed at his feelings. He told me I was making him miserable. I didn't care. Then he assured me that he could not live with me if I continued to behave as I had done. I allowed this to make me more angry than ever, and I determined that I would not give up that I had been wrong, and I bade him leave me as soon as he pleased.</p> 
               <p>"Laura, I cannot tell you all that followed,-how I taunted that noble-hearted man-how I trifled with his feelings, and how I blindly, recklessly, unriveted the strong links that bound his heart to me. I saw that a change had come over his countenance-that it was deadly pale, and that his lips quivered. He went to the cradle where you were lying and took you up in his arms. He pressed you to his bosom and kissed you; I saw a tear fall from his eye, and I saw his lips move as if in prayer. Then he laid you back in the cradle and left the room. He came not back to me that night. The next day I received a letter from him, in which he informed me that he had placed ten thousand dollars in the hands of a trustworthy person, and that I could draw the interest semiannually for my support. I was frantic with grief-my heart was almost broken-my head whirled in agony-but I could gain no intelligence further. From that moment, Laura, I-I-never saw-my husband again!"</p> 
               <p>As Mrs. Burke ceased speaking, her head sank upon the bosom of her child, and she wept aloud.</p> 
               <p>"And you saw him not when he died," murmured Laura, winding her arms about her mother's neck, and sobbing with grief.</p> 
               <p>"I know not that he is dead, my child," returned Mrs. Burke, and as she spoke, she sank upon her knees and prayed that her daughter might be saved.</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>Laura Burke stood by the side of William Withington, and her right hand rested within that of the young man. It was evening, and she stood there to be married.</p> 
               <p>The clergyman who had come to perform the ceremony, was a stranger in the place, he having come from a distant part of the country, and at the present time he had assumed the duties of the pulpit for one Sabbath while the regular clergyman was absent from the town.</p> 
               <p>The magic words that made William and Laura man and wife were spoken, and the couple awaited the parting advice and counsel of the minister. He spoke of the important duties they had taken upon themselves-of the responsibilities they had voluntarily assumed. Then he fixed his eyes upon the fair bride, and while his lips trembled and his eyes gathered moisture, he said:</p> 
               <p>"To you, my fair child, I would fain give a word more of counsel. You must remember that the HOME-ALTAR is under your ministrations; and O, fail not to see that the purest of your affections are kept burning there, so that they shall ever light with a joyous brilliancy the life you have chosen. O, could you but know what happiness, what earthly bliss hangs upon your course, you would never-"</p> 
               <p>The clergyman stopped. His eyes had filled with tears, and his utterance was choked. At that moment a low cry broke from the lips of Mrs. Burke. The minister turned and caught her eye All present wondered at this scene, but when, in a moment more, the mother of the bride tottered forward and sank upon the bosom of the clergyman, they were lost in amazement.</p> 
               <p>"Amantha!" whispered the man, as he bowed his head. "Amantha!"</p> 
               <p>"My husband! O my husband. Have you come to forgive me?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes, my wife. Is there not happiness for us yet on earth?"</p> 
               <p>The mother would have spoken, but she could not. She could only cling more frantically to her husband, and bless him that he had come back to her. None were there but that wept at the scene, and Laura left the side of her new made husband to seek the embrace of her father.</p> 
               <p>At length the mystery was explained to those who had witnessed the novel scene. But to his wife and child alone did James Burke tell of all he had suffered-how he had wandered from place to place-and how he at length became a preacher of the gospel. He told how his heart had yearned to see his wife, and how he had forgiven her for all she had done, and also, that he had determined to see her once more, and for that purpose he had come back.</p> 
               <p>Years have passed away since that evening, and James Burke and his wife still live, but their old age is happy-happier far than their days of youth. And Laura, she is indeed a noble, true hearted wife. Her "MOTHER'S LESSON" was her salvation.</p>

               <head>THE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.</head> 
               <head type="sub">[FROM THE FLAG OF OUR UNION.]</head> 
               <head type="sub">FRANCIS A. DURIVAGE.</head> 
               <p>WHEN Mr. Dolland began business for himself in the city of New York, he made up his mind that, rich or poor, he would retire to the country at the expiration of twenty years, while yet young enough to enjoy life. At the expiration of the period assigned by himself for his commercial career, he found himself at once wealthy, and a widower with an only child, a dazzling beauty of a proud and imperious nature, and self-willed as an hereditary princess. Juliet, for that was her name, was averse to her father's project of retiring into the country, preferring rather to flash her diamonds and black eyes on the elite of the beau monde, than waste her costly toilette and destructive glances on plain country gentlemen. But on this point Mr. Dolland was inflexible, though on all others he was yielding and submissive to a fault. Juliet finally consented to a compromise. She magnanimously allowed her father to purchase a magnificent estate on the banks of the Hudson, on condition of being allowed to pass as much of her time as she pleased at the town residence of her aunt, Mrs. Rackett, a dashing widow, much of Juliet's stamp of character, who lived quite up to her income, saw a great deal of company, and was plunged up to the eyes in fashionable follies.</p> 
               <p>The villa of Mr. Dolland was a superb mansion, and the estate attached to it comprised more than two hundred acres of land. As little dependence could be placed on his daughter, Mr. Dolland placed at the head of his establishment as housekeeper, a very excellent woman by the name of Markham, a widow, who had been for many years attached to the family, rather as a friend than domestic. With him resided also, his only niece, Miss Mary Hamilton, a charming and modest young person, who, if she were completely eclipsed by the brilliant beauty and accomplishments of her cousin, far surpassed her in delicate and feminine characteristics. Mr. Dolland had another relative, a nephew, who at the period when our story commences, was with the army in Mexico.</p> 
               <p>The persons we have described above, with three or four servants, formed the household of our country gentleman. We ought perhaps to add Mr. Augustus Montague, a young man excelling in mustachios and polkas, whose acquaintance Miss Dolland had formed at her aunt's, and who often consented to run up from New York and favor Mr. Dolland with his company, remaining for weeks at a time, riding his horses, shooting his game, and keeping the "governor," as he called him familiarly, company over his claret and champagne.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dolland was not very fond of mustachios and high-heeled boots, and, as a general thing, ignored the gentlemen who wore them; but Mr. Augustus Montague was so civil and attentive, and condescended so kindly to hector the servants, a thing their employer never had the heart to do, that he was always very glad to see his brass-studded travelling trunk appearing from the steamboat landing. Besides, if anything were wanting to justify the esteem in which he was held, had not Mr. Montague once saved the country gentleman's life, when that worthy person, all unused to the perils of freshwater navigation, had belayed his sheet and bore away instead of luffing in a squall on the Hudson, whereby his boat was upset and he himself placed in imminent peril of drowning?</p> 
               <p>When he first made his appearance at River dell, Mr. Montague was very much struck with the beauty and accomplishments of Miss Hamilton, being observed to sigh and cast up his eyes frequently, to neglect his plate at dinner, to wander forth alone of moonlight evenings, and to produce dismal howlings by means of a flute, which set all the dogs in the neighborhood wild. But after he had obtained from Miss Hamilton, by means of very adroit questioning, the fact that she had no money, being a dependent on her uncle's bounty, his attention relaxed, his appetite improved, and the flute was fortunately restored to its case. This little incident occurred just about two years before the commencement of our story.</p> 
               <p>One morning they-that is Mr. Dolland, his daughter, Miss Hamilton, and Mr. Montague, the "friend of the family," were seated at the breakfast-table at Riverdell, when Mr. Dolland, who had been intently perusing his newspaper, suddenly exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Great news! Scott has taken Mexico!"</p> 
               <p>Juliet's black eyes flashed with fiery exultation-but Mary's filled with tears, and her voice faltered, as she said:</p> 
               <p>"And the killed and wounded, uncle!"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dolland took up the paper again.</p> 
               <p>"Major Clarence Huntly," he read.</p> 
               <p>Mary uttered a faint exclamation, and sank back in her chair, pale as death.</p> 
               <p>"Slightly wounded," pursued the old gentleman. "Thank heaven for that. The paper says he behaved most gallantly, and he is spoken of by Scott in the despatches. Upon my word, I'm glad of it-the young fellow is a credit to his family."</p> 
               <p>And Mr. Dolland wiped away a tear from his glasses as he laid them on the table, for the accounts of his nephew's gallantry had touched his heart.</p> 
               <p>"That sort of thing is very well," said Mr. Montague, carelessly, "for those who like it, but for my part I can't understand the philosophy of volunteering. If I were in the army when a war broke out, I should, of course, do my duty, but I should never think of offering my services to the government after the commencement of a row, as your nephew did, particularly if I were as rich as he is. I never run into unnecessary danger."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly not," retorted Juliet, with a slight expression of scorn. "To-day, for instance, when I took a five-barred gate in a flying leap, you got off your horse, opened the gate, and led him through it."</p> 
               <p>"Very sensibly done," said Mr. Dolland; "I don't approve of your mad cap equestrian feats, Juliet. And it strikes me that I have forbidden your risking your neck in that way."</p> 
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6021-00000042"/> 
               <p>"Dear sir!" said Juliet, "there's no danger. Why, the other day, my horse was baulky at a leap; but I made him take it three times running, and though he fell with me the third time, I was on my feet sooner than he was."</p> 
               <p>"Juliet! Juliet!" cried her father, "don't worry me by repeating such stories."</p> 
               <p>"You're so nervous, papa!" cried the young lady, with the slightest possible contemptuous shrug of her pretty shoulders.</p> 
               <p>Before they rose from the table, a letter was handed Mr. Dolland from his nephew the major, announcing that General Scott had insisted on his returning home to recruit his health, and that he might be expected at Riverdell almost as soon as the letter.</p> 
               <p>This news, you may be sure, threw the whole house into commotion. Mrs. Markham was at once delighted and disconcerted. "To come upon us so suddenly!" she cried, as she bustled about from room to room in a fever of preparation. Mary could not control the joy that dawned in her sweet blue eyes, and dimpled about her rose-bud lips. The worthy proprietor of Riverdell was unusually excited. Mr. Montague alone was impassive, as an effete dandy ought to be, and Juliet affected or felt a sort of haughty, nonchalant indifference.</p> 
               <p>"My dear child," said her father, "are not you going to change your dress?"</p> 
               <p>"What! on account of my cousin's arrival, papa? It would be gratifying the wretch too much."</p> 
               <p>"On my account, then," said the old gentleman. "I choose to have my daughter do the honors in all the splendor of her finest toilette. Recollect, Juliet, the charms of the Mexican senoritas have rendered the major critical, no doubt. And you know, my dear child, how near and dear to me this young fellow is. I should break my heart if he didn't become my son-in-law, as we arranged it before he went to the wars."</p> 
               <p>Juliet made no reply, but retreated, to comply with her father's wishes.</p> 
               <p>At last the major arrived-a fine, dashing young fellow, with a bronzed cheek and jet black mustache, his handsome figure set off by his undress uniform, and his appearance rendered more interesting by his wearing his left arm in a sling. He was, of course, warmly welcomed. Mary was almost the first to meet him, and her simple and affectionate greeting touched the soldier's heart. Montague, presented as the "friend of the family," was very patronizing, and assured Mr. Dolland that he considered Major Huntly a "very good style of nephew."</p> 
               <p>On his part, the major, who had seen the world, distrusted Montague, and took the first private opportunity of questioning his uncle about him.</p> 
               <p>"My dear boy," said the old gentleman, "he is what you see him. A dandy-an epicure-a good shot, a good talker and a good dancer. My daughter picked him up at Rack-ett's. He saved my life once, and there he is. Nobody knows much about his origin, but I have heard some reports injurious to his character, and have written to Sharples, my lawyer, to ferret out his history."</p> 
               <p>Their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Juliet, who was imperially dazzling. The young soldier was evidently struck with her beauty, and Mr. Dolland soon discreetly left the young people together.,</p> 
               <p>"Well," said the young officer, "here we are, Juliet, and it is very easy to perceive why your father has left us to ourselves."</p> 
               <p>Juliet cast down her bewitching black eyes, and sighed deeply. There was no affectation in that sigh.</p> 
               <p>"I see how it is, Juliet," continued the young soldier. "Your heart does not ratify the half-engagement that your father formed for it. Well-it's hard, perhaps, to renounce such a treasure, but, although I love you as a cousin, I will never marry you."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you-thank you, dear Clarence," replied the young lady, squeezing his hand. "But my father-if he knows that I have refused your alliance, will overwhelm you with reproaches."</p> 
               <p>"I will take all the blame of the refusal on my shoulders," said Clarence.</p> 
                
               <p>"How generous you are!" exclaimed Juliet. "Ah, Clarence! had I only known you sooner. You know not how much I stand in need of your friendship and advice. But here comes my father back again, and Mary with him."</p> 
               <p>"Of course," said Clarence, laughing, "he expected to find me kneeling at your feet in the orthodox lover fashion, your right hand in mine, your downcast head turned away in maiden modesty, and your cheek suffused with many blushes."</p> 
               <p>The old gentleman was rather irate when he found the major and Juliet indisposed to ratify the engagement, but was obliged to content himself with a promise that they would think of it, and so granted them a temporary reprieve. Was Mary Hamilton grieved at this aspect of affairs? We cannot venture yet to read her little heart.</p> 
               <p>After dinner, the major signified to Mrs.Markham that, fatigued by his journey and wound, he should like to lie down for a few moments,-and that lady immediately ushered him to the best room in the house, a beautifully furnished apartment, out of which an airy bed room opened. Montague had been occupying it, but the housekeeper declared that he must be satisfied with other quarters now, as it clearly belonged to the major. She had already had his baggage conveyed thither.</p> 
               <p>Clarence threw himself upon a sofa and soon fell asleep. He dreamed that he was lying at a solitary outpost, and that the guerillas had suddenly surprised his camp. He seemed to hear distinctly the clash of arms, and the yell of the brigands, and sprang to his feet broad awake. Just at that moment Juliet entered the room, and started back on seeing him.</p> 
               <p>"You here!" she cried.</p> 
               <p>"Didn't you expect to find me here?" asked the major.</p> 
               <p>"Yes-yes," said the young lady, in some confusion. "O, cousin!" she added, hurriedly, "I am glad I have found you-for I have so much to tell you."</p> 
               <p>Clarence made her sit down-she looked pale and suffering.</p> 
               <p>"Dear Clarence," she said, "I have a secret to impart to you. I am married."</p> 
               <p>"Married!" exclaimed the major, "and to whom?"</p> 
               <p>"To Mr. Montague," replied the girl. "I knew it was a rash and wrong step-for I knew very little of him. But he had qualities that dazzled a giddy head like mine. He won my heart. I knew my father would never consent, for, in the first place, he wished me to marry you, and, in the second place, Montague is poor-has neither a profession nor an income. But he overpersuaded me, and we were secretly united. But this secret is preying on my heart."</p> 
               <p>"Fear nothing, dear cousin," said Clarence, pressing her hand. "This news, it is true, has taken me by surprise, but I will befriend you to the utmost of my ability, and break the news, if you will, to your father."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you-thank you, Clarence," said Juliet, her eyes filling with tears, as she returned the pressure of her cousin's hand.</p> 
               <p>At this moment Mr. Montague entered the room. "Excuse me," he said, with a bow to the major. "I really beg pardon for intruding."</p> 
               <p>"The apology should come from me, sir," said the major, rising. "This room belongs to you, and I restore it to you. Juliet, I will see you again shortly."</p> 
               <p>And with another courteous bow to Montague, the young officer retired.</p> 
               <p>"I don't like that young fellow," said Montague, throwing his elegant person on the sofa.</p> 
               <p>"You are very wrong, then," said Juliet; "he is the soul of generosity."</p> 
               <p>"I never could fancy paragons and phenixes," said her husband, in the same dry tone.</p> 
               <p>"He has promised to intercede with my father, Augustus?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't want any of his interference,"replied the gentleman.</p> 
               <p>"He is the only friend I have left," said Juliet, bursting into tears.</p> 
               <p>"Confound it!" cried the adorable Augustus. "Don't cry. If there's anything in this world I sovereignly detest-it is a woman's tears. But, hark! I hear your father's step.<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6021-00000043"/> I'll escape by this side door. I don't care to meet him just now. Be prudent-and remember what I said about the Mexican hero."</p> 
               <p>"My dear child," said Mr. Dolland, folding up a letter, as he entered, "when shall the wedding take place?"</p> 
               <p>"O, dear father," cried Juliet, "you promised not to hurry me-and I have a secret to confide to you."</p> 
               <p>"Young ladies' secrets are very important affairs, I know," said the old gentleman, smiling, as he took her hand. "Is it some project for a new gown, or a new cap? But you tremble, my child."</p> 
               <p>"Thank heaven!" murmured Juliet, "here comes Clarence. The major has got something to say to you, papa," she said, as the young officer entered.</p> 
               <p>"Very well," said Mr. Dolland. "Let me hear what <emph>you</emph> have to say, major."</p> 
               <p>Clarence took the hint. "My dear sir," said he, "Juliet and I wish to solicit your clemency in behalf of a young person who is very much to blame."</p> 
               <p>"O, yes!" cried Juliet, "much more than I can express."</p> 
               <p>"What <emph>is</emph> the matter?" cried the old gentleman. "Has Mary anything to do with this?"</p> 
               <p>The major hesitated a moment, and then replied, "yes, sir. You told me this morning that a good while since Mr. Montague appeared to be paying attentions to Mary."</p> 
               <p>"True," said the old gentleman.</p> 
               <p>"Well-what should you say if she loved him?"</p> 
               <p>"I should be very sorry-for she has nothing but what I choose to give her; and I have just learned from Sharples that Montague has wasted the fortune his father left him, and hasn't a penny in the world-and no means or wish of earning a living."</p> 
               <p>"O, heavens!" cried Juliet.</p> 
               <p>"But what should you say, sir," continued the major," if, not daring to brave your anger, and led away by her youth and inexperience she has married this man whose address, you must confess, has even fascinated yourself?"</p> 
               <p>"Impossible!" cried Mr. Dolland.</p> 
               <p>"No, sir, it is a fixed fact-they are married."</p> 
               <p>At this announcement the old gentleman burst into a paroxysm of rage, and uttered many of those incoherent and unpleasing expressions which old gentlemen so circumstanced have a habit of indulging in. Even Juliet, proud and imperious as she was, trembled at the energy of her usually mild parent.</p> 
               <p>The major resorted to the usual emollients in cases of this kind. He stated the truism that "what can't be cured must be endured," and arguing from this proposition, finally succeeded in pacifying him, so that he consented to see Montague and Miss Hamilton.</p> 
               <p>"And now, sir," said the major, when the parties were brought before him, "I must confess that though my tale was true, yet, in order to gain time, I have taken the liberty of changing one character in my little drama."</p> 
               <p>"What do you mean?" cried the old gentleman, looking curiously at the faces which surrounded him.</p> 
               <p>"I mean, sir," said Clarence, firmly, "that if you could pardon a niece for an imprudent step, you are much more strongly bound to accord the same indulgence to a daughter."</p> 
               <p>"Juliet!" cried Dolland, in a tone of thunder.</p> 
               <p>"Father, forgive me! forgive my husband, rather," said the poor girl, "it was all my own fault."</p> 
               <p>"I forgive you, Juliet," said the old man, melted at her appeal, "but you have married a beggar."</p> 
               <p>"Not so, sir," said Montague, with much dignity. "I have been an idle, extravagant fellow, I confess, but I have resolved to shake off my sloth and go to work in earnest; and be assured, sir, that while I have two hands, and a heart equal to any trial, I shall be no beggar, nor shall your daughter ever regret having trusted her happiness in my keeping."</p> 
               <p>"But you have no capital to begin with," said the old gentleman.</p> 
               <p>"I beg your pardon," said the major." There are twenty thousand dollars subject to his order in the Bank of Commerce."</p> 
                
               <p>Montague grasped the young soldier's hand, and tears of real feeling quickly glittered in his eyes.</p> 
               <p>"O," cried Mr. Dolland, "if you come to that, nephew, Juliet shall not be a portionless bride. But my dear boy, I'm sorry I couldn't find a wife for you."</p> 
               <p>"If this dear girl," said the major, taking Mary's hand, "will condescend to crown the hopes of one who bore her image in his heart amidst the storm of battle, you will have no cause for regret."</p> 
               <p>"You are jesting," said little Mary, tremulously.</p> 
               <p>"Will you accept my heart and hand?" asked the major.</p> 
               <p>"You see she hesitates," said Juliet.</p> 
               <p>"No, no," said the poor girl, in the hurried accents of delight, "I accept."</p> 
               <p>"Huzzah!" said the old gentleman, dashing his spectacles to the ground in insane exultation. "This is the happiest day of my life but one."</p> 
               <p>Not long afterwards the two weddings were celebrated in the little church whose graceful spire is seen from the western piazza of Riverdell villa; and that night every window of the country-house blazed with festal illumination.</p> 
               <p>Sufficient time has elapsed since then to deepen the happiness of the major and the lady, and to show that the union of Montague and Juliet was an exception to the usual unpleasant termination of hasty and secret marriages, the "friend of the family" proving, after all, one of its best members.</p>

               <head>GOING AN ERRAND:</head> 
               <head type="sub">OR PLAYING DEADHEAD.</head> 
               <head type="sub">[FROM THE FLAG OF OUR UNION.]</head> 
               <head type="sub">GEORGE S. RAYMOND.</head> 
               <p>I may as well tell you by way of introduction, that about the year eighteen hundred and-, second cholera season, there were three brothers of us living in the village of Huron, a port of entry and embryo city, inhabited mainly by bullfrogs, bilious fever, ship carpenters and sailors, situated on the southern shore of Lake Erie, some fifty miles to the westward of Cleveland, and being at that time a town that could boast of a better cultivated graveyard than any other village in the whole west.</p> 
               <p>Well, there we lived-three brothers of us-Fred, the oldest, a ship-builder, with a wife and three duplicates-two of himself and one of Mary. Myself next, with the same amount of wife and children as Fred, and the commander of a little brigantine belonging to Huron, hailing from Buffalo, and running just wherever I could get business.</p> 
               <p>Last and least of the lot, was Hank, a small fellow with a very small wife, one miniature edition of himself, and master of a little fore-and-aft schooner, with which he was engaged in the rock trade, carrying stone from an island at the western end of the lake, for the purpose of building another as a foundation for a light house, at the entrance of the Maumee River.</p> 
               <p>We had all been there in Huron about two years, and the people began to take exceptions to us as citizens, inasmuch as they said it was a time-honored custom for every family to make at least one deposit in the burying-ground within a year after they became residents of Huron; and there we were, three brothers of us, families and all, and not a single tally for the whole during a residence of double the time prescribed by custom. They said it wasn't fair,-that among twelve of us, three at least ought to have died; and some few there were who spoke out boldly, declaring that if we wouldn't die, we ought to be killed or driven out of the place.</p> 
               <p>The suggestion was not acted upon, however, and we remained among the Huronites till the cholera set in, and then it seemed that the ardent hopes of the graveyard advocates must be gratified, for the fell disease was cutting down its victims at a rate that threatened the total depopulation of the town in three weeks of the scourge should last so long, and it seemed unreasonable for us to hope for an escape when others were dying faster than they could be buried.</p> 
               <p>The epidemic was at its height as I arrived in port from Buffalo late one afternoon, and scarcely had I got fast to the wharf, when Fred came running down all out of breath, and after informing me that Hank's wife was just taken down with the cholera, requested me to jump on board a steamer which was coming in just then, and go off after Henry, who was up somewhere among the islands.</p> 
               <p>"Why don't you go yourself, Fred?" I asked, "I haven't been home in six weeks, and I expect my wife will be sick very soon, if she is not already; that's what I've now come in for."</p> 
               <p>"I tell you she aint sick, nor wont be this week," Fred replied, impatiently; "and if she is, she wont die of cholera. I can't go, for little George and Frank are both down with this confounded fever, and Mary is almost worn out with nursing 'em, and-"</p> 
               <p>"Hold on, Fred; don't say another word," I shouted. "I'll go;" and off I started on the run, down to where the big steamer Cleveland was just ringing her last bell preparatory to shoving off.</p> 
               <p>"Captain Hart," I gasped, as I brought up at the gangway, almost out of breath, and looked up at the commander of the steamer on the hurricane deck, "Captain Hart, my brother's--wife is--dy--dying, and I want to--go up to the west-no, Middle Sister, after him. Will--"</p> 
               <p>"Yes-yes-I understand you. Jump aboard. I'll land you,!" and the next moment I was on the steamer's deck, and she was backing out of the harbor.</p> 
               <p>"You look tired," said Captain Hart to me, after a few minutes' conversation which we had together after the boat was underweigh.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I am," I replied. "Haven't slept a wink these three nights. Had two men die on the passage up from Buffalo, and-"</p> 
               <p>"Well, don't stop to talk, now; go right down and turn in."</p> 
               <p>"But, Captain Hart, I want to land on the island; and if I should-"</p> 
               <p>"Go down below and turn in. I'll call you in time. It'll be two hours-maybe three, before we get up to the 'sister,' as we stop at South Bass to wood, and you can sleep all that time-go down."</p> 
               <p>I obeyed orders, and in less than ten minutes I was sleeping like a marine off soundings.</p> 
               <p>I might have slept till the close of navigation for aught I know, had I not been aroused by the clang of the steamer's bell, and leaping out of my berth, I rushed on deck and found the Cleveland going like a race-horse up Detroit River, less than five miles from the city, and full fifty past where I ought to have landed.</p> 
               <p>"Blast it all, Captain Hart," I said, as soon as I could find him; "you've been and-"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I see I have; but, thunder! I got asleep myself, and didn't wake up till they called me after we came in by Bois-blane. It's too late now; but look here. You can go down with us this afternoon, and I'll land you, or you can take the steamer for Toledo, this morning, and she will set you ashore on Turtle Island."</p> 
               <p>"That's it, captain," I said; "I'll take the Bunker Hill, and I'll bet Captain Nickerson wont send me down to turn in, and then carry me past without letting me know it."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you can safely bet that; for if Nickerson offers you a berth at all, or anything to eat, it'll be more than he ever did to a dead head passenger yet," replied Captain Hart, as he went off laughing.</p> 
               <p>"Will you land me on Turtle Island, Captain Nickerson?" I asked, of the commander<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6021-00000045"/> of the crack steamer. Bunker Hill, a minute before she shoved off, and three minutes after I left the Cleveland.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied the dandy captain, snappish as a wolf; and as that was all I wanted to know, I went up into the saloon, took up a paper and made myself comfortable, expecting to be called to breakfast of course, according to lake deadhead custom, when the officers sat down. But I wasn't, which I looked upon as a little singular, considering the captain knew me very well as the master of a vessel. However, I said nothing; but after the officers were done eating, I went to the captain's office and paid my fare to the clerk who was a stranger, and took my ticket, which of course entitled me to breakfast,-and thus armed, I walked up to the table, and began ordering this and that, as though I were the owner of all the steamers on Lake Erie.</p> 
               <p>"Cabin passenger, sir?" inquired one of the waiters, eyeing me rather suspiciously.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, that says so," I replied, as I held up my ticket close under his nose.</p> 
               <p>"My stars, captain! have you been paying your fare?" asked Captain Niokerson, who was standing directly behind me.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I have," I answered. "It was the only way I could get a fifty-cent breakfast. But never mind, sir, it's not much-only a dollar-fifty."</p> 
               <p>"Not much!" he cried, in a tone of alarm; "it'll be much to me, sir, if the public find out that sailors are obliged to pay their fare on this boat."</p> 
               <p>"That's just what I thought, captain, when you told the steward I was a dead-head, and he need not ask me in to breakfast."</p> 
               <p>I caught him by guess that time, for I had heard nothing of any such order; but he colored up like a young thief, owned that he did give the order, begged my pardon, and then begged ten times harder for me to take my money back and give him the ticket. I hung off till he offered at last fifty dollars if I would take back the dollar-and-a-half, and say nothing about it. But after he was punished about enough, I took the price of the ticket, and agreed never to mention it on the lake.</p> 
               <p>I went into the lady's cabin about an hour after breakfast, where I became so deeply interested in the company and conversation of two ladies of my acquaintance, that I forgot all about my mission, and when I went on deck again the steamer was just abreast of the island, where I saw my brother's vessel in the act of getting under weigh, while square between us and the island was the big opposition Steamer Constitution, with which we were racing, both boats doing their utmost to get into Toledo first.</p> 
               <p>"You couldn't think of landing me, Captain Nickerson?" I asked, as I met him on the upper deck.</p> 
               <p>"Impossible, under the circumstances," he replied; and so I got a ride some fifteen miles up the river, while my brother went off towards the islands after another load of rocks, ignorant that his wife was laying ill-perhaps dead of cholera.</p> 
               <p>As I leaped from the gangway at the moment the Bunker Hill ranged up alongside the wharf at Toledo, I observed at the very next wharf below a miniature steamer, which was, apparently, just ready to shove off, and being well acquainted with her captain, I made up my mind at once to charter her if possible to go direct after my brother.</p> 
               <p>"Where are you bound, Sol?" I asked, as soon as I got within long hailing distance of Captain Solomon Phillips.</p> 
               <p>"To Sandusky. Want to go, captain? Jump aboard, if you do," and in less than ten seconds I was on the deck of the little seventy-five ton steamer Commerce.</p> 
               <p>"Look here, Sol," I said, as I shook hands with the captain, "I want you to take a sweep out by the islands, instead of running down along shore."</p> 
               <p>"Couldn't do it, captain," said Sol. "Got thirteen passengers, and they'll all get mad as Fan Slicer's cat, if I go off there."</p> 
               <p>"But, Sol, I have come up to find Hank; his wife has got the cholera-maybe she's dead fore this time, and if you'll only go off to the islands, so that I can find him, I'll give you fifty dollars-ay, a hundred, if you say so."</p> 
               <p>"Go 'way with your fifty dollars, captain! Do you think Sol Phillips is a mean skunk, and haint got no heart nor nothin? I'll go, sir; and if Hank's in among them islands, we'll find him, if it takes till next week. Go 'way! I wont have no fifty nothins; and if my passengers get mad because I go to look for a man that's got a wife dying, why, blast 'em, I say; they may get pleased again if they live long enough."</p> 
               <p>My heart was too full to admit of my thanking the noble-hearted young captain in words, and so with a silent grasp of his hand, I turned away, while he repeated my request to the engineer, and urged him to drive the boat through the water at her best speed till we gained the islands.</p> 
               <p>Sometime before midnight, we reached the Middle Sister, where I knew my brother generally loaded; but he was not there,-and then after hunting in vain for him among the other islands, we bore up at my own request for Sandusky, where we arrived about four o'clock P. M.</p> 
               <p>It was only ten miles from Sandusky to Huron, but there was no kind of conveyance, and so I leaped on board the Steamer Constitution, which was just leaving the wharf, making my calculations to a certainty that she would land me at Huron, as she always touched there.</p> 
               <p>But I made another mistake; for, on making inquiry after we got some two miles from port, Captain Robinson informed me that, having no freight or passengers for Huron, and being about five hours behind his time, she would not touch at any port till she reached Cleveland, just fifty miles farther than I wanted to go. There was no alternative, however, and so without a murmur, I resigned myself to-supper and destiny.</p> 
               <p>It was scarcely sunrise when we entered the harbor of Cleveland, and within ten minutes thereafter, I was on board the General Wayne, bound back to the westward.</p> 
               <p>I told Captain Pratt my story, and when he got over his laughing-fit, so that he could speak, he informed me that he would certainly land me at Huron if nothing happened. But there <emph>did</emph> something happen; for within two hours she broke one of her cranks, and the captain putting all his passengers on board the Buffalo, which was close to us at the time of the accident, bore up for Cleveland with one wheel, to repair damages.</p> 
               <p>There was no other passenger than myself to land at Huron, and I at dead-head, so that Captain Allen most respectfully declined stopping, and the next morning at daylight I found myself once more in Detroit, where as good luck would have it, I found the Columbus, a Huron boat, about ready to start, and as Captain Walker lived in Huron himself, I considered my chance of getting home about equal to a certainty.</p> 
               <p>We were off Sandusky about three o'clock P. M., heading in for Huron, when out from Sandusky Bay came the Commodore Perry, a rival boat, and a race ensued, in which Captain Walker swore he would beat old Wilkinson, if he had to run all the way to Buffalo without stopping.</p> 
               <p>The Columbus was the victor in the race; but she was within five miles of Cleveland when the contest was decided, and the moment the boat touched the wharf, I sprang ashore,-and making a solemn vow never to put my foot on board another steamboat until I had seen Huron, I started off at midnight on foot for home.</p> 
               <p>I walked the fifty miles in twelve hours, and when I arrived at home I found that Hank had been there three days, his wife was up and about the house, Fred's two children were almost well, my <emph>four</emph> (one that I had never seen), all alive and kicking, my wife almost half crazy about me, and the Huronites in general disappointed that, instead of the cholera having made one at least out of the twelve a graveyard fixture, we had become during the pestilence a baker's dozen.</p>

               <head type="sub">EMMA T. WILSON.</head> 
               <p>"HANNAH! Alice! one of you run into the front room and see if that carriage stopped here, or at the next house. I thought it sounded as if it stopped here. It may be a visitor, and here am I in my morning dress, and not fit to be seen," exclaimed Mrs. Tracey, to her two daughters. Hannah and Alice were her only children.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Tracey was simply a fashionable woman, and she endeavored to make her daughters like her. Hannah, the eldest, was the exact counterpart of her mother,-handsome, dashing, and fashionable; but Alice, although very pretty, and having such examples as her mother and sister always before her, kept herself free from love of show, and was a gentle, amiable, high-spirited girl. I will say that Mr. Tracey was a plain, kind, sensible man; and now I have done with description.</p> 
               <p>Alice, who had run to the window, quickly cried out:</p> 
               <p>"Why, mother! it is Mrs. Mansfield."</p> 
               <p>"Not that old Mrs. Mansfield, who was here last year?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it is, mother. But why do you call her old? She used to be a great friend of yours before you were married."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, I suppose in reality she is no older; but then she has seen a great deal of trouble, and always seems so very much older, that I have got into the habit of calling her old.'"</p> 
               <p>They had closed the folding-doors, and Mrs. Mansfield had been shown into the front room. When Mrs. Tracey and Hannah saluted Mrs. Mansfield, it was, "My dear Mrs. Mansfield, how do you do? I am very glad to see you." Alice said, simply, but earnestly, "how do you do, ma'am?"</p> 
               <p>"Now, Jane," proceeded Mrs. Tracey, "You have come, I hope, to make me a long visit. I shall be delighted to have you. You must make yourself perfectly at home, and do exactly in this house as if it were your own."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps, mother," suggested Alice, "Mrs. Mansfield would like to go up stairs and take off her things, and lie down awhile, for she has been travelling all night."</p> 
               <p>The offer was kindly accepted, and Hannah went up stairs with her, and soon returned with the tidings that Mrs. Mansfield would try and sleep, as riding in the cars had given her a violent headache; and she would like a cup of weak tea.</p> 
               <p>"That is the beginning; it will be get this, get that, and wait upon her from morning till night," exclaimed Hannah, pettishly.</p> 
               <p>"Don't begin to complain <emph>yet,</emph> Hannah," said Mrs. Tracey. "You will have enough to complain of before her visit is out. I shall tell Ann that she must do everything Mrs. Mansfield wishes her to, even if she has to neglect her work."</p> 
               <p>"I pity her, from the bottom of my heart," sighed Alice, meaning Mrs. Mansfield; but Hannah thought she meant Ann, and replied, accordingly:</p> 
               <p>"So do I; but somebody must be a slave to her while she is here, and it is better that it should be Ann than myself."</p> 
               <p>The cup of tea was taken up to Mrs. Mansfield by Ann, the under-house-maid, a cross, slatternly girl, who seemed not to take the slightest pleasure in anything, and did what she had to do in such an ill-humored way, that she was throughly disliked; but she was strong, and so Mrs. Tracey kept her. When Mrs. Mansfield received the tea, she sighed to think that neither Hannah nor Alice could have brought it to her. Had Mrs. Tracey forgotten the days when they were girls together? Many years had flown since they met, and time had laid on both his withering hand; but while Mrs. Tracey presented all the beautiful traits of a peaceful, happy decline into the vale of years, the countenance of Mrs. Mansfield was furrowed with the deep lines graven by sickness, sorrow and care. She had been much more handsome than Mrs. Eliza Tracey, in her girlish days, but trouble and sickness had dimmed that beauty without utterly destroying it. In one year she had lost her only sister, her husband, and an only daughter, who had just reached her seventeenth year. Her own mother and father were only children, and her husband an Englishman, so she was without a relation on this side of the globe. She, it was said, had only enough money to support herself with care, and that she contrived to make the most of it by visiting among her friends. Who does not pity such a woman?</p> 
               <p>At dinner Mrs. Mansfield made her appearance, looking much refreshed by her little rest. Mr. Tracey seemed really glad to see her, and was so kind and friendly that she felt that she was not wholly unwelcome. After dinner poor Mr.Tracey went back to his counting house, and the girls sat down to their work. The afternoon passed pleasantly, and in the evening they went to some place of amusement, Mrs. Tracey saying that an evening with only themselves must be very stupid for "dear Jane," who, nevertheless, protested that she would rather stay and pass a quiet evening, and would really have been much happier let alone.</p> 
               <p>The truth was, Mrs. Tracey dreaded an evening without some excitement. Poor Mrs. Mansfield was voted ungrateful by Mrs. Tracey and Hannah for not appearing delighted with the entertainment.</p> 
               <p>"So it will always be, Hannah! I never knew a woman who had changed so. When she was first married she was very pleasant, and I used to have a great deal of pleasure in having her visit me," said Mrs. Tracey.</p> 
               <p>"But, mother, do you think you could be half so calm and kind as Mrs. Mansfield, if you were without a relation in this world, and had met with as much grief as she has? I am sure I should not; I think I should be very peevish and hateful," put in sweet Alice.</p> 
               <p>"Child, you have not seen as much of life as I have, and don't know that people may be pleasant, and yet thinking hateful things all the time. "You don't understand such things."</p> 
               <p>Alice sighed. She thought she did, even<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6021-00000047"/> young as she was; but she said nothing, and kept steadily working on. She longed to show Mrs. Mansfield how much she loved her, but her mother had told her to treat Mrs. Mansfield kindly, but not put herself out; for if she did,</p> 
               <p>"Jane would spend the winter there; in fact, there was no knowing how long she would stay, as it was."</p> 
               <p>One day Mrs. Mansfield had gone out, but had returned rather sooner than she was expected, and going softly, as she always did, to her own room, she overheard the following conversation carried on in the next room, which was the girls' chamber, between Mrs. Tracey and her daughter.</p> 
               <p>"Well, girls," exclaimed Mrs. Tracey, "how are we to do about this evening? I cannot think of having you give up this party, for both Mr. Latimer and Sinclair will be there,-and I want you to secure them if you can, and leave no opportunity of doing so unimproved. I can't give up, myself, for I am getting wearied to death with this stay-at-home life. What shall I do!"</p> 
               <p>"Let me stay at home with Mrs. Mansfield?" asked Alice.</p> 
               <p>"Let you stay at home! and what is to become of the rich Mr. Sinclair?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't know what will become of him. I have said, mother, many times, that I don't like Mr. Sinclair, and will not try and win him."</p> 
               <p>"I know that you are an obstinate girl; and are nothing but a trial to me," exclaimed Mrs. Tracey, pettishly.</p> 
               <p>"Only think, mother," said Hannah, who was cross because the folds of her ball dress did not fall as she wished them to, "she says she would rather stay at home with that hateful old Mrs. Mansfield, than go to Mrs. Graham's ball. I don't believe it, for one. I guess she expects a call from Mr. Harvey."</p> 
               <p>"Hannah!" implored Alice, "how can you say so? You know Mr. Harvey is in New Orleans, and if he were not, I should not stay at home for him. As I said, I would like to spend the evening with Mrs. Mansfield. We have not troubled ourselves much about her."</p> 
               <p>"I told you not to pay her any particular attention," said Mrs. Tracey. "If people will come where they are not wanted, they must expect to be treated coldly."</p> 
               <p>"How Alice can pretend to like her, I don't see," said Hannah.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I do like her. I think she is a very loveable person. She is not half as disagreeable as old Mrs. Berritt, and I am sure Hannah gave up the opera to stay with her one evening when she staid with us."</p> 
               <p>"Why, what a goose you are, Alice. Mrs. Berritt is very rich, and has nobody to leave her money to. Of course I would make myself as agreeable as I could," said Hannah.</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me, mother," said Alice, "if I say that I think you ought to treat her coolly, and not make her think you are delighted to see her. Why, when after spending one week she was preparing to go home, did you urge her to stay longer, and then complain in private because she did? I think you ought to tell her she has staid long enough, and not practice such daily, hourly hypocrisy."</p> 
               <p>"Who taught you, Alice, to take your mother to task in this manner?"</p> 
               <p>Alice burst into tears and sobbed out. 'Mother, dear mother, I am not taking you to task. I am only telling the truth."</p> 
               <p>After a great deal more talking, it was finally agreed that Alice should stay with Mrs. Mansfield.</p> 
               <p>"Be sure you say that I never let either of you go alone to any parties, for I shall give that as an excuse for not staying with Jane tonight," said Mrs. Tracey.</p> 
               <p>"If she asks me, I shall avoid answering her, but I shall not tell an untruth," replied Alice.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Mansfield had not listened to this conversation from mere pleasure, but she hoped to get an insight into the character of Hannah and Alice. Eliza Tracey she knew was frivolous, but that she was unprincipled, she never suspected. "And I have been a bore. They have wished me gone, yet urged me to stay. Now I know that what I thought was indifference ence in Alice was not. That she dared not show me any attention. Dear Alice, I shall be able to know more of her in the evening;" so thought Mrs. Mansfield. She was interrupted in her meditations by a tap at her door, and Mrs. Tracey entered.</p> 
               <p>"My dear Jane, I came to apologize to you for going out this evening, but Hannah, childlike, has set her heart on going to Mrs. Graham's ball, and I make it a rule not to let them go alone to any parties. Hannah is so spirited she must have some one near to check her a little. You will excuse me. I shall leave Alice with you. She wanted to go with us, but I told her she ought to stay with you, and-"</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry she should be made to stay, for I should be just as happy alone. I shall tell her so," interrupted Mrs. Mansfield.</p> 
               <p>"O, no, don't! It will make her feel bad. Pretend you think she staid of her own free will."</p> 
               <p>"Do not be uneasy, Eliza. I shall say nothing to make her feel unpleasantly."</p> 
               <p>She left with her daughter for the ball, and Alice was happy at having an opportunity of showing Mrs. Mansfield some attention. They talked together some time on common themes. Mrs. Mansfield was pleased to find how well-informed Alice was. There were many things about her that reminded her of her departed daughter, and she struggled in vain to repress the tears that would flow. When Alice noticed her emotion, all her reserve was overcome, and putting her arms round her neck, she said, in her peculiarly sweet tones:</p> 
               <p>"Dear Mrs. Mansfield, they are happier now than you could ever expect them to be on earth."</p> 
               <p>"Alice was received with a warm kiss, as Mrs. Mansfield said:</p> 
               <p>"How could you tell why I wept?"</p> 
               <p>Alice blushed, for she had been thinking of her mother's behaviour towards the friend of her youth. They conversed for a long time, and Mrs. Mansfield told Alice of her husband and daughter, and Alice grew to love her dearly. In the middle of the evening the bell rung, and the servant announced "Mr. Harvey." Alice blushed, but the light in her eyes was brighter as she welcomed him.</p> 
               <p>"My dear Mrs. Mansfield!" he exclaimed, as she turned towards him. She was an old and dear friend of his mother. They were very happy, those three, that evening.</p> 
               <p>When Mrs. Mansfield went back to Boston, she took sweet Alice Tracey with her. Alice had been with her sometime, and was thinking of returning home, when Mrs. Mansfield was taken ill of a malignant fever. Alice watched by her night and day, but she soon found she must lose her friend. A few days before she died she requested Alice to write and summon Harvey. He came, and she was made happy by uniting their hands. She gave each a package, to be opened on their wedding day. She died, regretted by a large circle of friends. Alice and George Harvey went back to Baltimore, and when the term of mourning had expired, they were married. The packages were opened, and Alice's proved to be Mrs. Mansfield's will, bequeathing to her the sum of ten thousand dollars. Harvey's was a present of three thousand dollars, and the house she had lived in while in Boston.</p> 
               <p>"Only think!" exclaimed Hannah, "she was not so poor after all. "I am sure if I had known it, I should have paid her some attention."</p> 
               <p>"I am very glad you did not know it," said Mr. Tracey, quietly; "and I hope it will be a lesson to you to treat both rich and poor with equal consideration."</p>

               <head type="sub">[FROM THE FLAG OF OUR UNION.]</head> 
               <head type="sub">BY SYLVANUS COBB, JR.</head> 
               <p>WHEN Savage and Peter Paucet were neighbors, they both raised an immense number of apples, and one of the chief sources of their cash income was from the sale of this species of fruit when dried.</p> 
               <p>"Hallo, Savage, what ye got there?" exclaimed Paucet, as he stood by his gate one evening in the fall, while his neighbor was passing.</p> 
               <p>"A paring machine. It's called the Automaton Apple-parer," returned Savage, as he stopped at his neighbor's gate and exhibited a neat, handy machine.</p> 
               <p>"Well, that's a curious looking thing," soliloquized Paucet, as he ran his eye over the novel affair.</p> 
               <p>"Not only curious, but valuable," said Savage. "Just get me an apple and I will show you how it works."</p> 
               <p>Paucet ran and got an apple. His neighbor took it, stuck it upon a fork made to receive it, and then with two or three turns of a small crank a keen knife ran quickly over the fruit, and in an instant the paring was off as "smooth and slick as a whistle." Paucet's eyes stuck out with wonder.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I declare, that is a contrivance. How much did it cost?"</p> 
               <p>"Two dollars," returned Savage, "and I tell you, Paucet, you'd better get one."</p> 
               <p>"Two dollars-two dollars, I declare that's too much."</p> 
               <p>"Too much? Why, what are you thinking about, man? Just look at the amount of time and labor it will save. With this machine I can pare five apples while you can pare one by hand."</p> 
               <p>"O, no, not so many as that."</p> 
               <p>"Then I'll go into your house and try."</p> 
               <p>Accordingly the two neighbors adjourned to the house. Paucet seemed to have a great curiosity to soe the machine work, and he readily agreed to a trial of its merits, so he took a knife while his neighbor used his new purchase. A dozen apples were placed upon the table, and they commenced. Paucet plied his knife, and just as he laid his apple upon the table, Savage placed his sixth one by its side.</p> 
               <p>"Well, that is a machine," Paucet uttered.</p> 
               <p>"To be sure," added Savage; "and of course you'll have one."</p> 
               <p>"I declare, I don't know. Two dollars is considerable."</p> 
               <p>"I know two dollars is quite a sum for men like us, but then you should remember that this machine will soon pay for itself, and make money beside."</p> 
               <p>"I don't know about that," said Paucet, still eyeing the machine.</p> 
               <p>"Why, it's plain as day," returned Savage, with much earnestness. "Don't you see that you can pare more apples?"</p> 
               <p>"No. You can pare them quicker-but then these long evenings, I shall have nothing else to do, and I may as well be paring apples as doing nothing."</p> 
               <p>"You don't look at the thing in the right light, Paucet. Time is as valuable as money. We have other things to attend to besides getting clothes to wear and food to eat. For my part I want time to read some, and I think this machine will help me to it."</p> 
               <p>"As for that, Savage, I can find time enough Sundays to read all I have to read. I only have one paper, you know-our little village paper-and I've sometimes thought of stopping that. I don't feel as though I could afford it."</p> 
               <p>Savage looked into the face of his neighbor, and as he took his apple-parer under his arm, he remarked:</p> 
               <p>"I tell you, Paucet, your ideas of economy are false. You look upon money in a wrong light. If the laying out of two dollars now will save two more in time to come, then true economy bids us do so. You must remember that one of these machines will last for years, and only think of the amount of labor and time that will be saved."</p> 
               <p>"But I tell you I have time enough," persisted Paucet.</p> 
               <p>"There you are wrong," said Savage, with a good-natured smile. "No man ever has time enough to waste. Let me tell you that <emph>time can be laid up.</emph> O, you needn't laugh, for it is true. Time can be laid up as well as money. Now see: Suppose you have six bushels of apples to pare, and I have the same. You will have to work smartly every evening in the week to do it, while I can do it in one evening; consequently, I lay up for some other use, the remaining five evenings that you will have to spend at your task. You wouldn't think of digging up all your land with a spade because a good plough cost you a dozen dollars; nor you wouldn't think of getting in all your crops on a wheelbarrow, because a cart and yoke of oxen cost a hundred dollars. No,-you see at once that such a course would be mistaken economy. Well, this apple-parer brings up the same principle. Don't you see?"</p> 
               <p>"But I haint got two dollars to spare," said Paucet, in a subdued tone.</p> 
               <p>"Well, just as you please," returned Savage; "only let me assure you that it will be for your interest to get one of these machines."</p> 
               <p>"O, darn it, what's the use? Two dollars will buy me a good many things that I need."</p> 
               <p>And so the neighbors separated-Savage to go home and put his Automaton Apple parer in operation, while Paucet set himself down to pare his apples with a common hand-knife as usual.</p> 
               <p>"Come, Paucet," said Savage, as he met his neighbor a week afterwards, "don't you mean to go down to the village this evening? There's going to be a great lecturer there?"</p> 
               <p>"No, I guess not," returned Paucet.</p> 
               <p>"O, but you'd better."</p> 
               <p>"No, I can't. I should like to go well enough, but I haven't got time. I want to get all the apples pared that I can while it is such pleasant weather to dry them."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, that's it," said Savage, as a smile played over his features. "Now you see I've been <emph>laying up time,</emph> and so I have some to spare this evening. How many apples have you got ready for drying this week?"</p> 
               <pb n="100" xml:id="VAC6021-00000049"/> 
               <p>"Six bushels."</p> 
               <p>"And I've got forty!"</p> 
               <p>"Thunder," exclaimed Paucet.</p> 
               <p>"My apple-parer works to a charm," added Savage, as he turned away.</p> 
               <p>Time passed on till winter. One evening after the ground was covered with snow, Paucet called in to pass a social hour with his neighbor Savage.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, here's something new," said Paucet, as he took up a large sized newspaper from the table and cast his eyes over its mammoth pages.</p> 
               <p>"Where'd you get it?"</p> 
               <p>"O," returned Savage, with a proud, happy look, "I sent to Boston for it. I just sent two dollars in a letter, directed to the office of publication, and now myself and my wife and children will have a good lot of interesting and instructive reading for a whole year, beside the matter that we get in our village paper."</p> 
               <p>"But I don't see how you afford it," said Paucet, as he still looked almost seriously upon, the great sheet which he saw was filled brim full of reading matter.</p> 
               <p>"I'll tell you, neighbor, Paucet, how I afford it. You see every year, till the present, I have had between fifty and a hundred bushels of apples wasted-some that had got bruised, and would spoil before I could get them pared; but this year I got them all secured. Upon a close estimate, I think my apple-parer has not only paid for itself, but made me a clear profit of ten dollars. While you have had to throw away to the hogs and cattle more than half of all your wind-falls, I have pared mine all up. I think, on the whole, Paucet, that it is a very economical affair."</p> 
               <p>"By gracious, so it is," responded Paucet; and then he sank into a deep study.</p> 
               <p>The next fall Paucet purchased an apple-parer, and he paid the two dollars with pleasure. Before winter set in, he had saved enough to send for the paper he so much coveted, and saved time to read it, beside laying up a few dollars extra; and for the future, he resolved that he would never again be governed by his old ideas of MISTAKEN ECONOMY.</p>
