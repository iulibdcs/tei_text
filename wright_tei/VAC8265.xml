TO THE FRIENDS OF LIBERTY WHEREVER FOUND. TO GENERAL S GRANT, SHERMAN, AND BURNSIDE, AD     - OTHEF  OFFICERS OF THE ARMY AND NAVY; ALSO THE SOL- DIERS, WHO HAVE SO NOBLY FOUGHT OUR BATTLES :  MY admiration of the devotion you have shown to the cause of preserving the integrityof the Union, the unspeakable-joy of receiving from your hands Libertye Flag, and from your lips her words, Be free " and, above all, my confidence iu your ability to rekindle, through the length and breadth of my adopted State, the signal fires of " 76," are my inducements to dedicate this work to you. The part I bore in the trials and sufferings which form the subject of the following narrative, is my voucher for its authen- ticity.    &#xD;<pb n="0" xml:id="VAC8265-00000003"/>  PREFACE. THE prevailing opinion at the North is, that theire is but, little Union feeling at the South, and that of rather an equivocal character.' Should these pages be the means of convincing any of our Northern friends that there is a strong, imperishable feeling existing for the Union and -"Old Flag;" it will com- pensate in a measure for the trouble in bringing these pages before the public.  This work was mostly written at the South, more than two years ago, while these scenes Were being enacted. , The "inci- dents here related are true. The characters are drawn from life. The writer was Conversant with most all, while others, were related by the actors themselves. Liberty has been taken to weave them so together, as to form a pleasing narrative, and by this means they will reach, and be read, by a greater number, than could be found to read each isolated fact; and this knowl- - edge of the Unionist sufferings would be more generally known, and my promise to those heroic souls in part cancelled. The question has often been asked, both in public and pri- vate, what are the feelings of the Southern women in regard to this war, striking as it does at their homes iand domestic relations uprooting at once their long-cherished and inherent distinction, of mistress and -slave. To this part of the com- munity, these pages are chiefly confined. You are taken to their firesides and homes, during one of the greatest struggles ever witnessed by mankind. In this- respect, it will be found,  &#xD;<pb n="6-7 (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC8265-00000004"/> :'6 - *PREEFACE.  this work differs almost entirely from all others written on Southern life. The world has never witnessed greater devo. tion, nobler instincts, and heroic deeds, than has been devel- oped -by- these uncompromising Unionists. T hose brave, self- 'reliant, souls, who have shown such patient endurance, self- denial,and unflinching courage, are worthy of a ' niche in the gallery of Fame." In timeit will be admitted that the real heroes and heroines of this war are these Unionist. men and women.    -    - a How successful this attempt to portray the position and feel- ings, trials and sufferings, of our friends South; during this la- mentable strife, the public will now best judge. - .

But not with the pivateer and hiss white-winged victims, whose' arrival that salute healaed, nor with the exultant crowd which thronged the streets and landing, to see the Yankee vessels and their crews, have we to do at present.

He will be at papa's office at twelve o'clock; finish your breakfast, then take my carriage to town.  "And you will spend the morning with Maggie? I accept your offer, and will bring your brother out with me to dine." We will follow the ladies to the window, where they had moved, that their -conversation might not be overheard.       ' For some moments Helen Bierce, the early caller, sat absently drawing her gloves through her delicate fingers. Then, raising her head with startling ab- ruptness she exclaimed:  "Why does not Harry Blout fit out a privateer? he certainly has ample means for doing so. It is uniaccountable to me," she added, how any one can enter the a*my when such another field for serving the South is open to them. This privateer- ing would suit me splendidly I to secure two such prizes as the (Pigeon' has just brought in; to meet an arnmed turtle, put on steam, up and away, and, just when the danger of capture is most imminent, slip'over the bar, and up the river home I There -is no State in the Confederacy like our own for such sport,: for none has 'such a coast,-sand-bar 'on sand-bar! '  "Harry looks upon privateering as nothing less than piracy upon the high seas," said her companion; "I have heard him say, repeatedly, the luckless fel- lows,-caught in the act, would meet the pirate's  doom, and deservedly."           ' '"And I see by your looks,.Maggie,you are of the same opinion.

"So there-are; but none who can aid me so effi- ciently as you." "  ("My purse is at your disposal," was' the evasive : reply. 4"Your time would serve me-best."

EYE-WITrESS. they came, for there was his card attached to the bundles! i Spirited away they must have been,' we - cried, (for nothing could leave that store without cash down ' and we knew whbn Mrs. Vinton left us she had not a dollar in her purse, To all of our entreaties to make known her weapon of attack, she smilingly shook her head saying: - ' Time'is money; let Saturday night find this goodly heap made up into garments and packed for Richmond.' At night, when . the room was deserted by all but ourselves, she related to me the incidents of the morning's call. But. you are laughing, why?  (C Nothing much."  '-' Mr, Blout cannot hear us?" "His breakfast' and paper seem to, enross his , attention." At the name of M.-,Weasel, a close observer could'not have failed to notice that the loiterer at the breakfast-table was unusually cautious in setting down his cup, and-that hi paper remained unread in his hand.  Indifferen as the young man was to female' chit-chat, Helen, had she noticed it, couldd not have complained, for -that morning at least, of his taking only a negative interest in her conversa- tion. His look of- interest and inquiry, however, escaped her, and she chatfed on incautiously loud. When Mrs. Vinton's name was' mentioned in con- nection with Mr.- Weasel's, an irresistible impulse brought Maggie'sl head without the folds of -the lace drapery which graced the window., Her eye caught Harry's; the significant glance escaped detection,  but the unfinished- smile brought the question. Satisfied that Maggie alone heardj Helen resumed: v -, ^  -.  -         -   .' '   EYE-WITNESS.        13 "I must give you Mrs. Vinton's adventure in her own words:  I stepped into the store and found Mr. Weasel complacently awaiting customers.   I retfirned his gracious salutation, complimented him upon having so full a stock of goods at such a time, and selected some hundred yards of domestic,- but here are the packages, so I need not particularize. His alacrity in bringing down and putting up his goods, and in- sending out for -what he had not, was really quite refreshing. The secret is, his many refusals to help fit out our soldiers have aroused the suspicion that, at heart, he is a traitor. Conse- quently no one goes into his store except those whom necessity drives there. "( You are purchasing supplies for the soldiers, I perceive, madam ,'h remarked, glancing at the huge bundles as he tied on the last string and affixed his card; ' where wilyoq have them sent?' "( To No. 9, two-doors this side of the barracks." "You are a great friend of the soldier." c( Not more than yourself, sir, I hope." "Not more -than I should be, did I see the neces- sity for arming men."^ "Where was there ever a greater?"' "War, Mrs. Vinton, is with us, as yet, but an abstract question." "I cahnot agree with you. The recent fight at Big Bethel shows me this war of independence is fairly inaugurated,- a war, which may prove unpre- cedentedi in its expenditure of treasure and kindred blood, but one, which shall see the South free or blotted out of existence." "The fight at Big.-Bethel, madam, was a mere skirmish. A few more such, and some conciliatory 2  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8265-00000008"/> "  .     EYE-WITNESS. measures will be adopted, and then an end put to this strife, ruinous alike to North and 'South." !"This is a time for action, not argument, Mr. Weasel. Willing hands must work if we would fol- low up our successes." Then, seeing that I was deliberately drawing on my gloves, he said:- "Excuse me. At any other time we should be happy to have your name on our books, but now " - "No apology, sir. I have no desire tob'h;ve it there." "You see," said he, pointing to a white card above his head, on which two very black words were painted, "' My terms are cash.' Something very scarce, very precious, just now." "But not so precious as the blood, that has been already and is to be spilled before we can call our- selves free from Northern rule, Northern cupidity, Northern fanaticism. When this struggle is over, when you have found your security in the brave soldiers, who do battle for you,- for all; if this cash- account is not wiped out by blood, generously spilt, by suffering patiently borne; then, sir, I will sell my own flesh and blood to Northern vandals and 'cancel your claim with their villainous gold." , All very well, madam; all very well! but I have no use for any body's flesh and blood. I demand my money!" Not noticing his interruption, I continued- "When the call came for three hundred thousand men, our people uprose nobly. Who was ignoble, cowardly enough to think of the pay he should get!  Ours is a common cause; the old and infirm stay at home: they give freely, give all they possess; the, young and brave fight, women and children work.    EBYE-WITNESS.         5 Cash down r   Money I Serve your country, sir  imitate the example so nobly set by your country- men, and your one talent of money-making shall be as blest to you as the five talents profitably laid out by the wise servant in the parable," and I turned to leave the store. , Zounds! madam," I heard; "flesh and blood can't stand this!--it is theft, burglary of high order I -restore my goods, or, madam, you shall feel the full rigor of the law!" As I reached the door, Mr. Weasel was at my side; Pete, however, at my order, had driven on.. I left him in his store door gazing after the carriage, crying--too late! too later- Now, Maggie, was n't that well done? "No, Nellie, your own true sense of justice -tells you Mr. Weasel was right, when he said  4 such a procedure was burglary of a high order.' Let those give who do so willingly, not ,c Nonsense! Maggie," interrupted Helen, "you remember the old adage, ' the end, if a laudable one, justifies the means;' and if to put the screws on misers, to make them disgorge some of their ill-gotten gains, is not justifiable, it is, at least, merciful; for we spare these money-changers, these ' votaries of Mammon,' the horrible fate of- falling a sacrifice to their own devotions, by lopping off shoots of interest, as we would the boughs of a tree, breaking beneath the weight of its own fruit, - is it not so? - But let me finish my story: the week's close found our work complete, and the box packed and marked-' Sol- diers' Relief Society, Richmond.' It was left in the work-room, the door was locked and every window secured, -I am sure of that.  Monday morning, when Pete went to the building, the box was there,  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8265-00000009"/> 16      -  YETE-WITNESS. but not a shirt, comfort, sock, blaiket, or bandage, -no not one, to be, seen! Of course the negroes are accused of the theft; but Mrs. Vinton and my- self have discussed the matter thoroughly, and, having heard nothing from the belligerent gentleman of Store No. 70, are convinced that to catch a weasel asleep is no easy matter. We, however, shall match him yet; for let the public be fully assured that this Mr. Wea- sel is one of the proscribed set, Union men, and not one box-ful but his entire stock is ours." , (   CHAPTER II. TWO UNIONISTS CAUGHT. AN unusual noise from without, at-this moment, attracted the attention of Maggie and her gtiest, and fully conscious that the tumult was approaching the house, they arose' and through the open window stepped on to the verandah. As the curtain fell be- hind the retreating figure of her mistress, Lizzie from her lookout :groaned: "It makes my blood freeze to- har dem hounds; somebody' blood runin' swhen 4dey howl like dat )' Then dropping her work and her- self upon her knees, she prayed that the poor, hunted negro might find favor in the sight of the Lord, who made him,land be spared the torture of his white master. "Confound that-'- --  of an- abolitionist, - see how he bleeds! Swing him from yonder limb, or he'll die before we twist the necklace! He 'Ie fight for Old Abe, and nobody else--will he? Swing him, and let him try his strength:with--them buzzaids  yonder! Heqr 'em cracking their beaks -- hold on a bit, old fellows, the meat will soon swing!" Such shouts -rent the air as, -mounted and afoot, an,eager crowd pressed round their victim-p a  man not more. -than twenty-five, and a boy scarce eighteen-; whose { j 2*  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8265-00000010"/> 18,       EYE-WITNESS. clothes, if such rags might so be called, were mired and fearfully rent, displaying the gaping wounds where the bloodhounds had taken hold. Deadly pale, but undaunted, the man walked in thej midst of his merciless tormentors, seemingly uncon- scious of his own sufferings, though- the warm blood trickled from his legs and shoulder, where the burnt flesh showed only too plainly, the nearness of the weapon, the sure lodgment of a ball, which had buried itself in his broad chest. No persecuted runaway negro was he, kind reader, but worse, far worse,- a hunted, hounded, and de- nounced " traitor" - the victim of an enraged and maddened people. His crime, the oath to stand by the good old flag, and Abe Lincoln, forever! Again and again the prisoner turns a fond and encouraging look towards the sinking boy at his side; Wvho', faint with loss of blood, staggers on, now pitched forward by a kick from behind, then sinking from sheer exhaustion amid the feet'of the crowd; while large drops of sweat, mingling with the tears, his agony wrung-from him, poured down his face and bloodstained body. Human nature could bear no more.  The fierce grapple of the hounds, the kicks and oaths of the exultant captors, were now alike un- heard, unfelt. As the stalwart hunter's arm was upraised, bearing aloft the lash, now of a deep red dye, which told of the strength of its cruelowner, a cry went out from' the bloodless lips of the brother so heart-rending that for a moment the slave-driver was -cowered and his arm fell to Ihs side.  . Fiercely his victim tugged at the iron bands, which bound his hands before him. The flesh parted and $.                  ,   ! EYE-WITNESS.       19 the blood flowed at each endeavor, but the iron would not give; deeper and deeper it sunk into his flesh; it was not .fekt, but in his soul it-rankled and tore.

Athletic in figure, his large, black eyes dilated and flashing, his face a-glow with the honest anger which burned within him at the cowardly, dastardly act, Just perpetrated, - a perfect type of manly and pow- erful beauty, Harry Blout stood, as unconscious of the deference which, on being recognized, was obse- quiously tendered, as of the sun which beat scorch- "gly upon llis uncovered head. He bent down, and lifting the bleeding body handed it carefully to a servant, who had followed him to the road! "There is life yet," he said,placing,;his hand upon the-boy's heart; "'take him, Pomp,:to Aunt Lizzie.

But the fierce, hang-dog eye of Grimes, the hunter, brightened as he recognized the man at his side; for even this brute, rich in the possession of the fiercest pack of bloodhounds to be found the country around, who spent six days out of seven in the woods and swamps, starving his " pets " to fatten them upon the blood of the luckless runaways, whom they never failed to scent and fasten themselves upon, had heard of and seen the. city wonder, "the Cuban cousin;" upon whom was showered exuberant praise, such as- c rich as Croesus; " "C generous as handsome," " such muni- ficence princely revenues alone could support;" and the like. ("Never did a better chance offer to make good his losses," (in the -morning's scuffle, two of his hounds had been killed,) he said, in an aside to one of the crowd, and the natural repulsiveness of his brutal face was heightened by the smile which the comforting words :called up. At a stern gesture of command, the handcuffs were struck from the lacer- ated wrists of the prisoner, his wounds cleansed, and his weary frame invigorated with stimulants. Then, for the first time, turning to the hunter, Harry Blout demanded the- price set upon the boy's head. "No price," growled the man, the scowl which ,the question brought increasing as the unwelcome truth was drawn from him. "How came he in your power?" "Caught him with that d--  abolitionist yonder," pointing to the man whom Pomp, at the command of his master, had mounted upon his favorite saddle- nag. :' Why let your dogs take his life?"Harry asled  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8265-00000012"/> 22        EYE-WITNESS.   -!* sternly.

Captain Green bowed and gave the order for his  company to form.   With remarkable alacrity they  wheeled their horses into line, and, with the prisoner,  slowly paced down the road.3 " Swindled into Secession' by as diabolical a fraud I as could be pepetrated; straining every nerve to fill  her quota of troops; sufferin g her noble-hearted sons i to 1be denounced and imprisoned because suspicion mark ed them as 4'traitors."

THE POWER OF GOLD ON THE HUNTER,  SIMULTANEOUSLY with the departure of Captain  Green and his company, Harry Blout turned to the  slave-hunter. He was stooping low in the road,  vainly endeavoringto- staunch the blood which flowed'  from the bide of one of his pets," whose lolling s tongue, dull eye, and gaping wounds, tell of a fierce  struggle within,-a struggle which will never be repeated. Even now  he falls upon his side, and with imploring eye fegs for the caress his master 9 bestows with a lavish hand; his eyes close, his jaw drops; nothing but thd slowly wagging  tail tells  of his gratitude. Big tears roll down the fierce- visaged man's cheeks, for he knows his dog must  die,-yes, is dead already.  With a wild stare and a convulsive tremor of the bleeding body, a third victim of the morning's hunt has been offered upon  the altar of human rage and demoniac fury.  Fire flashed from the hunter's eye as he turned upon the one who stood by, an unmoved spectator of X the scene; and curses thick and fast rushed to his lips, but were checked as he noticed the cool, deter- mined face turned towards him.  A low voice met  X his ear bidding him name his 'rice for the remaining ',      ,      X a       '     XI 4 *  *        *i   EYE-WITNESS.        25 hounds, - would he sell? There was but a momen- tary hesitation. The negro-hunter worshipped his profession and his hounds, and he as devotedly wor- shipped the gains they brought, and to sell his dogs was to throw himself quite out of employment. Comforting himself, however, with the thought that with the handsome sum, such as he should demand, there were other fields where his talents might have full scope, he sig nified his consent to dispose of his pa ck. With the price named he growled, " not too much; give 'em blood--" With a gesture of disgust, Harry silenced further encomiums upon the '" pets," and handed the man the amount he asked; then, with a significant glance, bidding Pomp " take' care of the dogs," "he cleared the 6low gate with a leap and entered the house. For such as Grimes, war was a profitable thing Never was heard such a running away of negroes; and with the tales of bloody violence and vicious theft which followed, came the unceasing cry for "hunters and bloodhounds." But a degree of danger attended these hunts, -for not a limited number, but scores, hundreds of runa- ways infested the woods and swamps, which made even the boldest of them tremble for their lives and their dogs, when the scent was struck and the grapple at hand with a dozen or more stalwart negroes, who had scented the blow which was to waft them to liberty. Hunters were not infrequently found dead beside their dogs, and such negroes, as were brought in,  were but few in number, and, in most'cases, crippled for life. The pa, therefore, although fair, scarcely compensated for the risk.,  3,  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8265-00000014"/> 26        EYE-WITNESS.            So it followed that nine of ten of these followers  of the negro-hunt disposed of their packs to the more venturesome, and stood in the ranks as'substitutes,-- their services being purchased by such lukewarm partisans as cried "( war! war!" and then, with glass o and pipe, settled down to the comforting reflection that war, on the whole, was a good thing; for, if productive of no other result, it swept the streets of paupers, and city and country of a " rake-helly " set,  that lent themselves to be the instruments of any villainy, provided the pay were good. In the prevision of the ardent antagonist, however, there was no such inglorious end to a strife of which  they were the abettors and supporters, but a free and recognized South. Oone red field, one thunder-like  groan from a prostrate, suppliant foe, and a people  had attained their pre-ordained position, - that of f framing for themselves a new, bright destiny. But to the few, uncorrupted, undaunted defenders of Unity and Law, that " first gun at Sumter" was no signal-gun, arousing a people, oppressed, to rise and burst the shackles of despotic power. To them, that gun was a death-knell, booming over the South, bidding "( Chivalry" rise and finish the work, de- feated ambition and unextinguishable rancor and jealousy' had begun,-- the digging of their -own graves!    -  Having carefully chained his pack of hounds, Pomp followed on his master'sfootsteps. He stopped not ' at the house, but over the lawn, by thestables ,down through the orchard, he trudged; his eye flashing the intensity of his joy, which the proper time and place heard to roll out, peal after peal, from the very depths  of his capacious chest.   EYE-WITNESS.   v     27 Seeking tli shelter of a wide-spreading gum-tree, he stopped to-rest, and, holding his hounds at arm's length, thus soliloquized:- "Oh  Massa Harry, dis yer earth has no other. like yer; neber did dis yer old boy tink to be de massa o' sich a pack o' devils own impsI 'Pears like de good Lord knows I'se de man for dis 'ticular case; for wid his 'mission, ye old sinners, ebery one o' ye shall be dead 'fore mornin' breaks." The dogs yelled and tugged for freedom, as though in the eye of their keeper they read the doom which was to be theirs before the advent of a new day. Up and on, Pomp toiled; his cabin is reached at length. With a kick the door flew wide, and the glad cry which followed effectually silenced his ylp- ing prize. So did it also "( Robert O'Lincoln," who from a neighboring' tree looked with his mate the surprise he did not utter, then alighted upon the window-sill of that usually silent'abode and curiously twisted his bright head to see his old friend, the ex- ultant possessor of such a dog-prize, so uproarious. But, for a moment only did that dark form, stretched upon the floor of his sanctum, give utter- ance to hais exuberant joy, for work was to be done. With the agility of youth he sprang to his feet, and in a twinkling a staple was driven into a log and the dogs chained fast to it. One long, lingering look he fixed upon the snarling, fighting creatures before him, then turned and left them, Duty calls Pomp to the " big house; " ours is not so imperative; so we; will linger awhile 'in hid cabin.

The hard, pine floor, white as soap and sand could make it. the three rough but strong chairs,  a mirror and a couch, bespeak nicety and ease' and the clay pipe and long reed stems, show no neglect. The bed with its white spread occupies one corner of the room, and at the foot of it, into one of the logs of the cabin, Pomp had -driven the staple and con- fined the hounds. Fox and coon skins adorn the walls, interspersed with a rare collection of birds. These, we see so carefully stuffed and tastefully ar- ranged, were not brought down by his barrel; boys  would kill, and Pomp would expostulate but all to no purpose. Silently he would creep to the hldge,  where the ruthless hand had thrown a bird, and when  no care could restore life, he would stuff and cherish its beauty, as if a pet- of his own raising.  If we lift the h-uge skin,. which hangs at the foot of the bed, we are in possession of a secret,- - Pomp's Jong-cherished secret, which, for him, has Paradise in it.       - One look will suffiee.

There was a time when he pined so for freedom, that his little mistress, her father's pride, took pity on him; and, with childhood's winsome ways, sought to overcome her father's obdurate will. But this is all that came of her earnest entreaty: - "My darling daughter, grieve me not by asking what would bring misery, the most abject, upon Pomp. Dry your tears. Pomp's life is a happy one; he has all he leeds; lays up money yearly; is cared for, well housed; fed and clothed. No, no, my child, papa knowJ what is for Pomp's good, and will always shield him from want and harm." "But, Papa, you will die one day," the child would reply, " then ,Pomp shall be free, for I will make him so." "Not so fast, little heiress. Papa will have to make a will, which shall restrict his wayward darling ,;. and he would add, pressing her to his heart, " all generosity, all- love.

Justfar enough removed from the busy hum and din of city life,; stands a noble mansion, decorated by the hand of taste in possession of an ample fortune. Broad and sweeping lawns'; gigantic trees inviting repose beneath their vine-clad, out-reaching arms; garden plots, teeming with the luxuriant products of that sunny clime; interspersed with exotics from other countries; a rich, dark belt of forest trees encircling. the grounds on the north and west, -lent an irre- sistible charm to this beautiful home.

Light and graceful verandas adorn the front and sides; here the white scented jasiriine wanders in unrestrained luxuriance, clinging to and completely covering the light columns, curtaining windows, and over-topping the broad, flat roof, wraps the high chimneys in a green and deliciously fragrant mantle.             ; Nor had the taste of the owner confined itself to outward adorning.

But when his cherished schemes gave promise of speedy fruition and incalculable good, the thread of life parted 1 'The grief of the household was most profound; and the wail of the. orphan was echoed by many a sympathizing heart, which bowed and wept for a ben- efactor gone.

Amid the splendors of court-circles; amid the inexhaustible stores of priceless treasures which the  old world seductively displayed to the cultivated mind and artistic taste of the travellers, both felt the same irresistible vearniing for their beautiful, but shadowed home. On arriving in their own sunny clime amid the congratulations of friends, the news of the brother's sudden death, and the sad entreaty of the orphan that her uncle and cousin should share her desolate home, came, and admitted of no delay. - They embarked the day but one following their arrival home, for the 'I States.?' Only two days out, the vessel which bore them encountered a  terrific gale. Though staunch and strong, the waves engulfed her; she went down, and all on board perished, save one, who was picked up a bythe ship Champion, on her way in port. Strapped  to the survivor was the dead body of the father, both being lashed to a plank.

Too intent upon her mission of mercy to n'otice the strange tone; delighted to have some one near to relieve her hands, that she might fill them anew, she exclaimed, without turning her head, "Take these bottles, I have forgotten the camphor. No, no. I will see the bo, - here, take my keys and go to the buffet and bring the camphor bottle. Quick! now. The poor boy's life depends on our despatch." In her eagerness her keys became entangled and would not yield to her nervous fingers. Unbuckle my belt and the keys will fall,' she said impatiently. "Dear, dear, you are so slow!" Pardon me, madam, I am not accustomed to buckles, was the quiet reply. Eager as Maggie was to reach the sick-room, there was something in the voice of the speaker which made her turn to look. With one glance over her shoulder, down fell the bottles from her hands outstretched to save the fall which her overwhelming confusion threatened. Too late! but strong arms caught and placed her upon the narrow step now moistened with laudanum and ether. This was no time for apologies-none were expected. "I am seeking the sick boy," the stranger said, "one of your servants told me I should find him at the head of these stairs. Shall I take the remaining bottles up with me, or seek the camphor?" he asked with a scarcely perceptible smile. "Take the bottles, if you please; it is the room at the right," said Maggie, and with a light bound she cleared the glass-strewn steps and entered the house. The long hour which had elapsed since Maggie left her side, was spent by Helen Bierce alone in the   EYE-WITNESS.        41 parlor. Deep emotion, which pride had repressed while there were those near to witness it, now wholly overcame her; and, as with agitated steps she walked the long room, large, scalding tears, such as never before had stained her haughty but expressive face, - rolled down upon her bosom. , Why don't Maggie come?" at last escaped her; I will tell her all." Then wrapped in her own troub- led thoughts, she murmured- "I cannot appear as that man's accuser. How nobly he risked his life to save mine I how tenderly- he bore me in his arms to his mother's door! how kind his voice and his eyes - foolish, foolish girl!" she cried, springing once more, to her feet, (for she had thrown herself upon a couch to stifle her sobs in its cushions,)-" can this be Helen Bierce, thus to yieldl to tears and womanish ' pity! To my country's need I have pledged my     , energies, my life. God grant if it be mine to seal a traitor's doom, that this heart, these ears of flesh may be turned to stone!.' Not long, and Helen stood once more on the ver- anda, no trace of her recent emotion visible except in her heightened color and the unusual brilliancy of her eyes.    ^  Her attention was shortly attracted to her coach- man, who was untying a horse at the gate.      l "Whose horse is that?

Harry spoke with her shortly after her arrival, and she seemed much relieved when he prom- ised her to see Charley, (as she calls the elder,) before night.' ' To know the brother was in his nother's care,' she said, ' would nerve him for the terrible ordeal before him.'" "Maggie," said Helen, while a sudden whiteness. overspread her face, ' I have a sad tale to tell you, but not now, you Dust rest first." "SNay, tell it to me now.  This fatigue will soon wear off---and your story may serve to banish the fearful scene of this morning." ; A- deep, heart-felt sigh escaped Helen; but recov- ering herself, in a light tone she said, ( If talking will ease you, do tell me who that gentleman is who owns so matchless a horse, and what brought him here to-day?. Th horse is just such a one as brother Will wants, and has been the State over to find. Poor Dine, he says he shall never make her .loss good." "Dine dead! Nellie, when did that happen?" Waiving her question, as through the half-open door she saw Harry Blout- approaching, with forced gayety Helen pressed her inquiries concerning the stranger:--  r  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8265-00000023"/> "   ,    EYE-WITNESS6 "You saw him, Maggie "  "Yes."

( What is that?" asked Harry. - Maggie shook her head: deprecatingly at the ques- tioner, and, before Helen could make answer, said :- ( You speak of a likeness between the two.

But I speak what I know to be wholly true, when I say, thatfthe merit of these two Charlestonians cannot be overestimated.

"Richard Whadden a general! hTe, the embodied essence of selfishness, never!

THE calm hour of eventide found Maggie looking out into the gathering darkness for the return of' Harry, that she might bear tidings of the prisoner to the trembling watchers under her roof. At her side Helen still lingered, striving to nerve herself to the task of unburdening her heart, a heart whose better i impulses were being uprooted fast by stern war's  , hateful bane. Winding her arm caressingly about  I Maggie, as they sat side by si e, she said at length,  "-( Hear what I must tell you, and then strengthen i me for what I must do." Little did Helen think, that the one, to whom she turned for: support, for courage to crush the woman, so she might serve her cause, was of the tabooed set. - Yankee sympathizers. Maggie's seeming indiffer- ence to the exigencies of the hour was attributed to the great shock she had sustained in the death of her father.

They knew the irresistible-power of right, and they felt that right must ultimately pre- vail. , What troubles you, Nellie? tell me," Maggie said. "You know, of course," Helen replied, " that all of our city ladies, except a few like yourself, who from family troubles have not met with us, have bound themselves by a vow as sacred as mortals can utter, to aid the South in this unnatural strife. My trial has come, and finds me weak, vacillating, and wretched." -( Your trial come, you have had it with you since  these troubles begun," said IMaggie, as Helen stopped and turned away her face in the vain endeavor to recover composure.

Not long since, on one :of my begging excursions, the horses took fright as Jim was dismounting to open the carriage door. They dashed down Danforth andGreen streets on to Main,  and were within a few feet of the railroad track, as the cars came in sight. A terrible doom awaited me, but at this critical moment, a man on horseback leaped at the horses' heads, With a blow Dine fell to the ground. I sprung from the carriage; I wa calm, much more so than I am now, but, in jumping, I  caught my dress, and was thrown with great violence against some timber near the track.- I was not  whollv stunned, for I remember being picked up and borne by strong arms some-distance. After hours of unconsciousness, I awoke to find myself on a bed in a strange house; at my side sat a dear little girl, sob- bing bitterly.

Now his life was in my hands; the knowledge of that alone I felt would make him  desperate. Steps were approaching; my resolution was taken. I sprung from the bed and behind the door through which he was to pass. As he crossed its sill and advanced a step beyond it, I waved- my handker- chief; the sickly, flickering flame went out. With an oath he turned back for another match, and I heard him curse the night air for serving him such a trick. The door, which opened upon the veranda, was ajar; on a chair near it I remembered seeing Mrs. Coxe, on entering, lay her shawl - It was but the work of a moment to throw it over my head and reach the street. Swiftly I ran until I gained the railroad track, then stopped'to take breath.

Up the steep bank he climbed; I was safe I I raised myself -and crept half way up the embankment, and by the faint -starlight saw my pursuer examining the carri- age. Baffled there! I could have shouted; for the carriage was a new one, and I knew the light was insufficient for him to recognize Dine. 'Thank heaven for murky skier I I shall escape you yet!' I mentally exclaimed. But no, his attention is again attracted towards me. Could the winds have borne my unspoken words to him, or did my eyes, which glared upon him, draw him towards- me by some mesmeric power I Hateful thought! I closed them and my mouth firmly, lest my fierce breathing should betray me.

How my heart leaped when I heard brother Wil's voice! (he was urging on a man, who had lain down upon the church steps, declaring he would sleep the night out there) - and it made me strong to encounter further peril. The two finally moved on, and I glided away. In a few moments I stood upon our balcony. I knew where Will's night- key hung; it turned in the lock, the door opened and I stole to my room. I lighted the gas; then walked to the mirror. One glance sufficed: that Dr. Hall must be sent for was as evident as the necessity of my removing every sign of the direful disorder of my appearance before ringing for aid. I When the light of the coming day first streaked the horizon my task was complete. I rung for my maid; the cook an- swered my summons. I told her I was sick; that Dr. Hall must be sent for; and that Jim must come directly to my room. To satisfy my own curiosity as to the absence of so many of the family, she told mel on entering that papa had been called out of town and had taken his wife and Kizzie with him. I must- expose myself to the like, and I was determined that no one should know of that night's adventure but our good friend and physician, Dr. Hall, for in his judg- ment and keen sagacity I have the" most implicit confidence. Jim came to my room; and of him I learned, that, in attempting to follow the carriage, he had fallen, and, although much hurt, had managed to crawl home. In his uncommon fright, he said, he was waiting for his master to come in - to make known the accident, when Dr, Hall drove up. He told him I was safe, where the carriage was to be found, and bade him go for me in the morning. Dine he had v  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8265-00000031"/> 60        EYE-WITNESS. ordered shot; she was so crippled by her fall. To my inquiry, why he (Jim) had not sent for the car- riage, he said, ' he set the boys off for the live. horse, but he thought dead property might go until morn- ing.' I told him I would give him one hour to bring home the' carriage, andi dispose of Dine; that if he was not up to time I should report him to his master, and he knew what would follow. He moved qmickly* away, utterly regardless of the night's bruises, if one he had; and I heard him mutter, as he closed the door, -' don't 'gree wid young missis to git upsot; neber seed her look so like old missis afore.' "How impatiently I waited for the doctor; I felt I was sinking, and did so need my maid to nurse me. It was the first time papa's wife had carried her selfishness so-far as to monopolize one of my servants; and the want of Kizzie, at this time, made Ime feel more thoroughly angry towards the woman, who fills my mother's place, than any of her acts of petty tvranny, daily practised upon one and all of our household, had ever done. "W1ith my head upon the window-sill, I watched for that well-known buggy; I saw it drive up i then a strange giddiness seized me. Recovering myself, I found Dr. Hall at my bedside. My first question made him laugh outright. ' ] did not strike you, wilful girl,' he said. ' I came here at your bidding, and receiving no answer to my knock at your door, I opened it and found an empty bed. A shape, envel- oped in a window curtain, however, attracted my attention; I picked it up and find it has a tongue.' He scolded me well for risking-my life to secure home nursing; but not until he had bound up my arm  anew and had administered an anodyne would he sig- .

Very grave, he sat, and I even heard him sigh as I finished my recital. How my heart blessed him,1 wh!en he said, ' Helen, leave all to me; Iwill answer all inquiries, solve all mystery, and keep your secret.' And, Maggie, at my earnest solicitation, he promised to aid the young man, traitor though he is, to escape from the State. When I remarked, that Dr. Brown should be exposed, he said: ' He was a former stu- dent of mine; but leave! this affair wholly in my hands; you certainly can trust me.' With the prom- ise to report to me what success he might meet with, and that his delay should be as short as possible, he left me. A severe run. of fever followed that night of fright, exposure, an6d fatigue. When I awoke to consciousness, I found Dr. Hall in attendance. Of him I learned that, on leaving me, that memorable morning, he had gone directly to Mrs. Coxe's house. He found the family in great anxiety, concerning my mysterious disappearance, but quieted all their ap- prehensions, Without exciting a suspicion of the real cause of my flight. Dr. Brown, he said, was not to be found, and, giving up the search for him, he returned to the house to find me alarmingly ill. To papa, he had explained the accident, and the cause which had occasioned my flight from the house where I had been removed after my fall. He avoided giving papa the name of the people w o had befriended me, but said, in the delirium of fever I not only mentioned 'their namle, but aroused hi 3 suspicion as to their character. He told me also, -th t papa- had made inquiries with regard to them, and was now only wuiting my con- *   I               ,    &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8265-00000032"/> 62        EYE-WITNESS. valescence to ascertain of me if they were correct. And hee added: , the young man, Helen, is beyond pursuit, - I have done your bidding; now take my counsel and have-no words with your father on this subject for several days to come.' "What I told papa on the following day more than satisfied him that Dr. Brown was a traitor, and for him, we both agreed, there was no doom too igno- minious. When he mentioned my preserver, I pleaded headache; that a few days would find me sufficiently strong to tell him all that followed my fall. Considerate, as he usually is, he seemed deeply to regret the delay I urged, and said: , You spoke the name of Coxe. I know of but one family of that' name in town. It may be, yes it may'be, that my -memory has played me false.' "' What may be?' I asked. "' That this Yankee Brown's boon companion is John Coxe's son.' To my inquiry who John Coxe was, he replied - "'A bitter, bitter enemy of mine, Helen; a man of some talent, but low-born, and possessing little wealth; a man the world would never have known had- he not allowed himself to become the willing tool of the Whig party.  Twice was he elected to the Senate.

"At night papa came again to my room. He and his men had been, to Dr. Brown's, but their search there was fruitless. I needed not to ask of the other, for his look confirmed my worst fears. 4 Not caught,' he said to my mute appeal; ' but John Coxe's son, he is P' "' How did you know where to seek him?'*I faltered.

The basket, which Kizzie- had filled for her, she gratefully took; but it was only after much entreaty, that she would consent to accept the sum ,the purse contained. On leaving, she handed Kizzie a slip of wrapping paper, on which was written: ' The prayer of the poor and afflicted has been heard and answered; God has made you the almoner of His giving.

"For heaven's sake, Maggie, do not appeal to my feelings," was' the passionate response. "( Duty, stern duty, must be uppermost in my thoughts." "Is the call more imperative now than it was when you besought Dr. Hall's aid to assist this man out of the State?" "I was sick then," Helen pleaded, " and allowed my heart to pervert my judgment; I have not now that excuse for iniquitous faltering, when the path of duty lies open before me."

"Do as you would, if your brother, not Charles Coxe, had fallen into the hands of merciless harpies," was the firm rejoinder. "But we must not forget this man is a traitor, and for all such there is: a special reckoning, -a special doom," persisted Helen. "Cousin Helen, is it for us to pass judgment upon a human soul? Are you or I accountable for any one's sins but our own?

" Not here," said: Havry, drawing Maggie out of the night-dews (for at the sound of steps upon the walk, she had left the house, heedless of damp and darkness, to relieve her intensely anxious thoughts,) and seating himself by her side on a bamboo settee in the hall, he resumed: "Yes, there is one, and but one hope of young Coxe's escape from being lynched."

"Maoggie, you are the exception to all womankind; but in the kindness of your heart you allow yourself to be most egregiously fooled.

JULY 7th rose clear' and calm, but the sun's rays beat down scorchingly; and although , Lazy Law- rence" could be plainly seen in the dry, parched atmosphere,-- a sign for all but workers to stay within doors,--the streets were thronged.  Fakr- faced women, forgetful of tan and  burn, pressed hurriedly on under umbrellas, borne by Afric's dark sons, or languidly reclined in cushioned carriage's, fanned by spruce-looking quadroon maids, as perfedt in feature, and but a few shades darker, than their proud mistresses; while lawyers, forgetful of briefs, and doctors of patients, with well-to-do merchants, planters, and  boys, swelled the crowd, thronging towards the Court House. The doors turn slowly on their hinges and the eager press surges through, flooding the wide entrance and filling the spacious hall to overflowing. Seats were reserved for ladieS, but many a   bold look and undisguised sneer fellf upon the dear creatures, who, with immense. effortS, were trying to bring within prescribed limits fabu- lous folds of mnuslin and  astonishingly refract0oy hoops.

"You, Molly, take care! another such a sit down and we shall be flooredt" cries a distressed voice. -Miss Miffit, white with apprehension, had been watch- ing her plump neighbor, who, overcome with the compound jostle of the crowd, dropped with two hundred pounds' weight upon- the creaking bench. The catastrophe of being brought to the floor was for the time averted, much to 'the relief of the timo- rous few who occupied the same tottering support. We will turn from the crowd to look at the pris- ;oner.- Disfigured by wounds, pale and emaciated, but fearless, Charles Coxe stood before his judges. He had broad shoulders, a bold heart, and a loyal soul; to die 'for liberty was indelibly stamped upon his expressive-face. From him we will glance at his accuser, Helen Bierce; for it was her name, which, connected with the man's arrest, had filled so many seats with the city's fluttering fair. At the question, I( If -she had ever seen the pris- oner, Charles Coxe?" she raised her lustrous black eyes to his face. Their looks met. Calmly she scanned -hi features; except a slight twitching of the muscles of the mouth and an increased pallor of the face beneath such searching scrutiny, no emotion was visible: the preserver and the rescued, the suf- fering but undaunted rvictim, the high-born aristo- cratic belle, the loyal soul and traitor's dupe, alike the gaze of the crowd stood unmoved, unread, save by the eye which searcheth all hearts. Helen turned to the questioner; her answer was a firm, clear II No I 1"  &#xD;<pb n="72" xml:id="VAC8265-00000037"/> 72        EYE-WITNESS. Down came the hammer in the hand of brief au- thority to command silence, for a disappointed mob was growing unpleasantly demonstrative. In the same shrill voice came the question, "Do you know aught of this Charles Coxe?" t' Only what -I have learned since his arrest," was the slow reply, Mr. Francis Bierce, one of the number before whose tribunal the "traitor" was arraigned, then arose. A smile broke over his face, so self-satisfied and bland that, as it met the ladies upon his right, saddened under the unfavorable turn Helen's replies had given to the affair, it carried full assurance with it. , My daughter, state fully what befell you June 18thi." The eager earnestness of the crowd increased as Helen related what she had previously told her fa- ther; but at her concluding words - " that the pris- oner in your midst and the man who bcrre me to that rendezvous of traitors is one and the same, you have no proof, no valid testimony, only a negro's word," -the crowd became uproarious, and, for a time, resisted all attempts to be quelled. Amid the din Mr. Bierce stood, frantically beat- ing the air in the vain endeavor to -call attention to his words. Those near him heard, -  The rene- gade Yankee Brown has escaped us! but see to it that no more of the vile scum slips- through our fin- gers! Charles Coxe is a Yankee sympathizer, my- word for it! - Let- summary punishment be visited upon all -such!"

Spout ahead Yankee!" stifling the weaker cries, ," String them both up I -no speeches, no prayers for traitors!" , Who am I?" shouted the bold man; "I am Richard Whedden of South Carolina, brother' of your General, Arthur Whedden." A wild burst of enthusiasm greeted this avowal, for the name of Whedden was a household word. Men forgot the diabolical act which was to imbrue ' their hands in a brother's blood; and women, un- mindful of flies and gnats, dropped .their fans,. and gazed admiringly upon the towering form, that had gained the estrade, and, proudly erect, stood thereon.

The shaft of truth sunk deep; and, when the im- passioned speaker ceased, its effects upon that homo- geneous throng, where all the elements of riot were so fully developed, far exceeded his own and his sup- porters' most sanguine expectations. True, he' had often been interrupted by the mut- tering of the storm, which threatened, but which was kept unider by the' many, whose better natures had been aroused, and who clamorously shouted, ("More I more!" With the glow still upon his face, which warmed his heart, that his words had not been utter- ed in vain, RichardWhedden once -more arose, and, after a powerful appeal to their feelings in behalf of the prisoner, said, "I told you I was a South Caro- llnian; my ancestors died in defence of that soil.

More and more des- perate grew the deadly affray. Pistols were dropped, and "Down with Secesh!'" "Death to the Yan- kees!f" hand to hand the rioters engaged. Those at the windows were calling loudly for aid, when a crash, as if-the building was rent in twain, fell upon the startled combatants. The floor had yielded to the immense pressure, and a yawning chasm presented itself to the horrified vision of the few, who,' still in imminent perils, clung to the windows and broken beams. The platform, and that part of the house reserved for ladies, escaped the fearful crash, which had swept Rebels rampant, Rebels timorous, fearless Union men, and quasi Union men, into one common pit, where death in hideous guise held high carnival.

Thus the- programme for the 7th of July read: An execution was to tcope off, as the sun wheeled into the zenith; as the day cooled, a military pageant was to fill the streets with martial strains and war- loving people; and with, night was anticipated the presentation of a flag to the pet regiment of the county. But the curtain fell upon muffled drums, stricken mourners, and open graves I In happy contrast with the wretchedness whi h filled so many households, was the room where mother, sons, and little sister Winnie, clasped in each others' arm--, gave God thanks for this sig- nal manifestation of the protecting love he has promised to the widow and fatherless; they had sorely felt the sorrow, which endureth but a night; the joy, which cometh in the morning, was now theirs.

Francis Bierce was duly informed that the pris- oner had either made good his escape, or, what was more probable, was among those so .fearfully muti- lated as not to be recognized, and now buried. The next question was, who, and where were the inen who dared draw in defence of " tyranny and Abe Lincoln?"A thorough search was instituted for the " traitors," but proved unsuccessful. It was a stubborn fact, and one generally accredit- ed, that scores of men in the surrounding country were daily leaving their customary pursuits, planta- tions, and homes, to conceal themselves in the moun- tains; and, report said, preparing to take the-- field en masse, when the time should come to aid the Yan- kee, invader; therefore a picked guard was set to watch, with unslumbering vigilance, every avenue of approach to these fastnesses. Days went by, and, as no arrests were made, the watch grew daily less wary.           ; It was night, and the sheep on the hill-top, no longer, caressed by the flickering, dancing light of   EYE-WITNESS.         79 the bivouac fire, looked down and saw Liberty swing wide the vast portal of her mountain ranges and lead on braves in paths, still echoing to the tread of those gone on before. Not a bivouac fire, not a challenge, not a sentinel I No sound, save the tramping of feet treason could not shackle, broke the stillness. To cities and towns came the astounding news of the disappearance of the guard to a man! Where were they! Go to the loyal sons of Caro- lina, now fighting for the nation's life, -they can tell. . Double the oice set on, c traitors'" heads, -double the guard,- double the vigilance, but of no avail; for Lib-erty, with her shining cohorts, leads on the van! while treason's minions bivouac in vain on- the out- skirts of her retreat, nor dare pierce the shadow which she leaves behind. In the firm belief that the impending blow, which the "Grand Northern Army" was to wield at Man- assas, would effectually wipe out the Rebellion, men, who from physical inability could not brave the moun- taineer's life, tore themselves from loving arms, and sought the secure retreat which the cypress swamps afforded. From these almost impenetrable morasses prodigious trees loom up, whose limbs are covered with a grayish moss, several feet in length, and in such quantities as to curtain a safe abode for one or more runaways.--In and around, the rattlesnake, and his no less venomous companions, the. moccason, blaclk-runner, and copper-head, keep guard, signalling intruding footsteps with the deadly rattle or terri- fying hiss. In such secure haunts Black Dick and Yellow Dine meet, --both runaways from cruel mas- ters or brutal overseers; each, perhaps, representa-  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8265-00000042"/> 80        EYE-WITNESS. tives of different counties, but each alike seeking refuge from the white man's tyranny. As with 'the entire race, with few exceptions, courtship and the marriage ceremony are abridged to the simple form- ula, "' be my woman, Rose,'" " ask massa, Sam,"' so these poor souls meet, and, resigning all former ties, Dick takes unto himself a new wife. Driven from the haunts of man by man's unrestrained violence, nature takes the wanderers into her lap and lavishy spreads her mosses for a screen by day and a couch for night. Birds of rare plumage- and rapturous note fill the dim woods with melody; while fruits and luscious berries hang temptingly near, and, falling at-the touch, fill the hungry soul with nectarian juices. No mam- moth task; no stinted rations, no lash, no bleeding back and groaning pallet, here await runaways, but liberty and life, free and joyous, over acres of soil the traveller fears and shuns with hurried feet; and the hunter with spurred heel urges on his jaded beast, lest dark night should find him wrapt in the spectral- haunted shadows, which steal up from these intermin- able wastes- It was a fearful hour, for a tornado swept the land. Houses were unroofed, fences prostrated, and the tasseled corn, and blooming cotton-patch laid low. A sturdy oak, which had braved many a blow, mightier than this, in years past, yielded to the blast, and (" crashing, thundering, shook the ground." "God be praised!" rose simultaneously from many grateful 'hearts; for the threatened danger, just escaped, offered a temporary retreat for the pursued. The unfrequented road, down which they fled, was, now rendered impassable by the fallen tree; for it L was sheer madness for their pursuers to strike out   EYE-WTITNESS.        81 into the forest which bordered the road on either side on such a wild, dark night. A score of men, panting with the fierce excitement of the deadly chase, crept beneath the boughs of the pros- trate oak, and, in mud mid leg-deep, laid down,--and it was time ; for a lull in the tempest brought to their strained ears the tramp of approaching horsemen. Soon a body of men appeared, the lightning playing upon their weapons,-for they were heavily armed, -making their faces glare out horribly beneath their limp, water-soaked caps. The barrier, which neither man nor beast could surmount, was met with a volley of oaths. "Halt!" was shouted, as others came dashing up; "the devils have escaped us! Back to the fork! - down to the left? We'll have them, yet!" The savage threat which silenced one" or two, who declared they had seen objects creeping down the road after passing the fork, left no room for farther sug- gestions or aught but implicit obedience. The hunters turned upon their steps- and sought the left fork; they found it, doubtless, but not the mud-soaked, exultant creatures, who crawled from about the huge tree, and, with mighty strides and laughter-ringing shouts, defiant of storm and farther pursuit, pressed on for the big swamp."     - K 'The East was kindling with roseate light, when our bard of patriots, with hearts swelling with gladness for dangers past and mercies near, reached and plunged into the thickest part of the welcome morass. Sinking into the soft, spongy soil, springing upon some inviting log, to jump as quickly from it, as the king-snake, his domain being so rudely assailed, crawls out therefrom, and, with glistening eye and  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8265-00000043"/> 82      -  EYE-WITNESS. arching neck, strikes terror into the hearts of the in- truders,--widely they scatter. Pitching, tumbling, floundering, tied up, thrown down by the thick hang- ing vines, these dauntless ones push on; for succor is nigh, and hope warms the heart and makes the ills of the hour the subject of jest and hearty good-humor. To the hunter, to the naturalist, whom the fox or some rare species of bird tempts to their borders, these swamps seem  impenetrable. "No human Afoot," say they, "can pierce such a wilderness; for if once entangled in the matted verdure, which often conceals dark pools, extrication is impossible, death sure." But dangers, such as the pleasure-seeker turns shudderingly from, make men, hunted and de- nounced, bold to encounter, and fearless to brave every ill, than to suffer a crucifixion of the soul. Suddenly the leader stops and bends low. A long, sweet note escapes him, which is answered by the shrill piping of the quail: the well-known signal is followed by rousing cheers, and the hanging mosses - of a cluster of trees, but a few rods from the wan- derers, part, and disclose the retreat of the vocifer- ous band, which leaps forth,-- and fathers, sons, friends, neighbors, alike supporters of liberty and union, meet.       CHAPTER X. PRESENTATION OF   FLAG, NEVER did a more brilliant throng grace Gaston Hall than on this night, -the one which is to wit- ness the presentation of the flag, and which unforeseen events had deferred. Flags, rich in satin, fold and golden tassel, heavy with bars (but not luminous, for the greater part are starless), festoon the walls, and flowers of rich color and ravishing fragrance, the triumphal arches, which span the rostrum, where soft light, perfumes from innumerable wreaths, and secesh devices of costly jewels, bestow a charm, which nought save the presence of the belleof the season, .the presenter of the flag and suite, could enhance. Gaslight, that unsurpassed beautifier, shines down upon beauty and grace, richly attired in gossamer fabrics; on aristocratic general-officers, whose gray uniforms shine with the badges of their profession; on  privates, glorying in the braided sleeve, where fair hands have wrought, with exquisite skill, the letters  of the cause for which they have pledged their lives; and upon citizens, very happy and very boastful of coming victories. At a word of command, the crowd, draws back, and, amid a wild burst of music, the  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8265-00000044"/> 84        EYE-WITXNESS, - graceful fluttering of handkerchiefs, and prolonged cheering, the gallant 7th moves down the hall and forms about the estrade.  All eyes turn upon the dis- tant curtain, which, rising from the lower arch, discloses a bright and beautiful vision. Amid the cloud-like drapery, which, in soft undu- lations, wraps the willowy forms of the attending ton, stands the tall, dignified Helen Bierce, severely, plainly dressed in homespuA- -          - "With no bewitching curls, kissing as they go Her brow, her cheek, her bosom of snow." With no clear drops appending to the ear, no brace- let, or! precious pin, but clothed in a cotton frock- the work of her own hand--she, the cynosure of all eyes, meets the unaffected stare of the crowd, and, with irresistible appeal, calls the eye-worship of the throng to her face, which a truly earnest soul lights up with a beauty indescribable. As the regimental flag is placed in her hand, and with inimitable grace she steps forward to present it, the motive, which prompted thip self-sacrificing cour- age, bursts upon the crowd, and vociferous shouts and overwhelming clapping followed. "Col. Blassing," she said, "( to you, the commander of this regiment, our hearts' love, to be our State's boast, we give this flag; we, who have made it, and consecrated it to Liberty, ask of you, its brave defenders, to place it upon the dome of the Capitol at Washington, where floats the flag of a once happy, united people, now a thing despoiled and hateful to our sight. It has been said, and truly, that the want of everything is fully made up by the spirit: of the cause, and the soul within stands- in place of discipline, organization,   EYE"-WITNESS.        85 resource. Suchb is the spirit, which animates every breast in our young Confederacy. We may be crip- pled and impoverished by our powerful adversary; but we cannot be conquered, sand scorn defeat! Our noble Beauregard calls you for the great struggle at Manassas; we bid you go to meet a foe relentless, vindictive, unscrupulous, to suffer, to die for your cause, and the honor of your mothers, your wives, your sisters. And shall we be unmindful of the price of blood and treasure which our liberty de- mands? No I the duty the God of battles enjoins upon us, shall be unflinchingly met; our jewels, our once valued gems, we throw intothe common treas- ury, and, discarding the luxuries of which you are deprived, clad in the durable work of our own hands, await duty's call to the hospital, or amid burning shot and shell to carry the cup of cold water; and if need comes with adms in our hands, to fight bravely by the side of fathers, husbands, brothers; for living we will be victorious, or dying, our deaths shall be glorious." The gay and- dashing Colonel received the colors and replied gallantly, handsomely referring to the noble example the presenter had that night set for the mothers and daughters of the South. In con- clusion, he said,: -"This banner, dear to us all, shall by our blood be defended, and, God willing, not only over Washington, but over every foot of North: ern and Southern soil shall the Bonny Blue Flag wave, proclaiming to the world the life, the unsul- lied honor, the mercy and sovereignty of our glorious Confederacy." The main feature of the evening over, gay forms flitted down from high galleries, and with braves, 8   &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8265-00000045"/> 86        EYE-WITNESS. "( so handsome and manly to view," sweep the floor in the mazy round of the dance. Under festooned arches, in shadowy corners forgotten by the revel- lers, in the dimly lighted robing-room, low earnest words are breathed. The lingering pressure of the hand, the ,( blush of consent," which speaks in silent eloquence to the heart of the brave pleader, the rap- turous embrace which the morrow's departure sanc- tions, the vows of eternal love, the wild pulse-beats of hearts, so soon to burn, to expire amid the fierce tumult of battle, why further depict?  ' -     j    CHAPTER XI. A MSTAKE IN A PROFESSION. BEHOLD us once more in Maggie Blout's parlor. She sits waiting Harry's return from the hall ;- he enters even now, and, chiding her for her grave looks, draws her to his side. "( And you will go with the regiment to-morrow?" Maggie asked; struggling to keep back the tears, which formed beneath the long silken lashes. "I must," 'But you, are incapacitated for the field," she said, gently pressing the maimed arm; ( say that you will not go, dear Harry," she pleaded. "e Hear what I have to tell you, dearest, then you will cease to urge me to remain idle at home. Of the political state of America I knew little before coming here; and what has come-to my knowledge since, without the seeking, was enough to convince me it was for my interest and peace of mind to shun lukewarm partisans as well as radicals. Never did I for a moment entertain even a vague surmise that the antagonism of the rival factions of North and South, though so fierce and bitter, would culminate in open rebellion; but the truth that it would do so was forced home to me some months since, when conced-  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8265-00000046"/> 88        EYE-WITNESS.  ing to your uncle's request, although in direct oppo- sition to my own feelings, I entered the Court-house to hear, as^ was announced for the evening, an eminent speaker, on the one subject of the hour- ' The despotic influence of a majority.' What, he' said, would be the despotism of the North, should the election of Abraham Lincoln be secured; and of the long-continued and increasing, usurpations of those who made, and as unscrupulously broke, laws of their own caprice, tyrannizing at will over the South, because the weaker of the two, could be summed up in these few words,--Do as I bid, if you would live!  The man before, us, Maggie, was a powerful speaker, and the intensity of his zeal was such as to win disci- pies -to any creed he might advance; and at his con-  cluding words, ( Let the South band themselves toge- ther and the North will cease to be the masters; cold, calculating, mercenary, unmilitary as they are, they will find themselves powerless to coerce and resist is.' I felt it was the bounden duty of the South to ,o out from such an association, peaceably, if she ouldj forcibly, if she must. Under this fearful de- usion I threw into the treasury what,-now that my ;yes are no longer blinded, made'my hands red 'red ts the hands of those who, not blindly, there cast in vith me; for ignorance is no excuse for my mad act." Harry stopped, and for several moments walked he floor, fuming silently; then throwing himself gain upon the settee by Maggie's side, he re- umed: - "' The morning following the lecture, I met Richard Vhedden, and rode with him to his house. Before ve parted, the scales one by one fell from my eyes, nd I knew I had been fearfully and wholly misled;   EYE- VITNESS.  A85 that not '( right," but " rule or rumn," was the shibbo- , leth on every lip of those whose cause I had-espoused. Would to God, before I had lifted one finger to aid these robbers, these murderers, my life had been taken! Now my life, my all, is pledged to atone for that irreparable blunder." "Harry, it was a deplorable mistake, still, much good has come of it; your giving so generously, has allayed all suspicion of your real sentiments, and enabled you to secure the retreat- of scores of per- secuted men from the State; beside preserving my house from the intrusion of military detectives." , That- much I have done, Maggie, and I go out to-morrow, secure in the confidence of the Rebels, to- strike when and where the most effective blow may fall." "Strike for those you stand arrayed against? that will indeed be hazardous." "Yes; with all the power Liberty lends to man for her defence." "( But, found in the active volunteer service of North Carolina, you will suffer." "No matter what I may suffer, I have the spirit to brave all fate may have in store for me. Say, have you forgotten the wild,life I led when a boy?" "( I know your courage and intrepidity, but--' 4( But what?  Say on." ( "You may be shot, and in some hospital languish unrcared for. See here," she added, rising and drawing a serge garment from beneath the settee, " you say duty calls you to the field; as imperative a one. makes me join the corps of nurses, which leaves here to-morrow, for Manassas." "Maggie "  8*     &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8265-00000047"/> 90        EYE-WIT'NESS. "Nay, Harry, I have besought you to stay at home where your own interest and others' require your presence, but you must go, you say; so must I. ,Do not look so grave, nor make an attempt to dis- suade me,-- my determination cannot be changed." ".Have you counted the cost of such self-saori- fice?"Harry said, to break the painful pause which followed Maggie's avowal.- "Yes, thrice-over. The agony of suspense is in- tolerable;, the labor of nursing the sick, comforting: it is for you, and you alone, that I go into camp or hospital - anywhere to serve you best." "Your affection for me, Maggie, priceless as it is, must not induce you to neglect higher duties at home; next to you, in my heart's love, comes Richard Whed- den. To serve me best is to watch over him, to conceal him from the villains on his track." , And leave you to the neglect of hirelings, if sick or wounded?" ,'Neither, Maggie; I shall come back to thank you, under God's mercy, for my friend's life." After a short, but painful struggle, the promise "to stay " was given; and, to interrupt the expres- sions of gratified affection which followed, Maggie said: "Enough of ourselves, dear Harry. Now tell me of your two special charges, Charles Coxe and' Mr,. Whedden." "Charles Coxe, thank Heaven, has made good his escape. I saw the negro, who acted as guide to ' Coxe and his men, to-day. Though hotly pursued, he said they eluded the armed gang on their track, and reached the swamp in safety." "This is indeed good news; and now of Mr. W 5Yhedden. Is not the search for him given over yet?"   ,                \   EYE-WITNESS.        91 "N o: and I fear never will be. He is safe here for the present only." "Has his property been confiscated?" "Yes: I bought what he valued most, and left it in the house."  "His horse, what became of that?" - ' I take him with me to-morrow." , Then all of Blout's Rifles can turn cavalry if they choose?" said Maggie, archly.  ' "No indeed. I do about as I please. - The horses which you saw on the morning of the hunt were hired for the occasion; if I mistake not, these men will see the time when they'll wish for horses, or winged feet. The North know our strength, and go doubly armed to meet us; the fighting will be no boy's play, Maggie, for on the issue of this coming battle, I confidently believe, hangs a nation's life or death. Now to business," he added ix " see hpw late the night." At this moment a servant entered, and handed her mistress a note. She took it, and at Harry's request, as it was from Helen Bierce, read it aloud:-- "The torture of the evening is over, the arrange- ments for the morrow complete, and I am weary and sick at heart. O Maggie, shall I ever be reconciled to dear,.dear Wil]ie's death? Had he fallen at his post, my wicked, rebellious heart would check its grief;, but to be crushed, to be suffocated is awful I I cannot stay hereJlonoer. I have sold my nag, my jewels, my wardrobe  all I own - and leave in the early train for Richmond. My life, so wretched, shall be spent at the pallet of our sick soldiers. Come to me, dear cousin; I am so sad to-night- the last- in my father's house. Discarded from his lo e, the idol  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8265-00000048"/> 92        EYE-WITNESS. of my heart buried, with no one to kiss me good-by, I go wretched, unloved, alone! I heard your cousin say, as he passed me on the hall steps: " he left with his regiment." These are his last hours with you ; therefore do not hesitate to refuse my request, if in my selfishness I ask too much. If you do not come, write me one loving word. To be forgotten by all but you is my earnest wish.     H- RTRN." The silence which followed the reading of the note, was broken by Harry's saying: "For once in my life I must acknowledge, I have misjudged a woman. The petted, spoilt child of fortune passed out of sight, when Helen Bierce, in defiance of her -father's threat, said ( No," on that memorable morning. It cost her the affection of a fearfully depraved parent,-- but for that one act of heroism she will feel fujly repaid, when awakened to a sincere conviction of her duty." Then rising, he rang for the carriage, adding, "I can spare you for a few hours, for Miss Helen needs you. Just five minutes for bonnet and shawl, not a moment over," Maggie heard, as the door closed after her. rat -   \   CHAPTER .XII. FAMTTY HSTORY. THE world said, Mrs. Tull loved her riches with tile fervor of adoration. Born heir to thousands of acres, and as many negroes to till them;, taught: from infancy, that to lack money was to lack a pass- port into the pleasant places of God's earth; taught al- so to look upon poverty as a crime, a scar, and its sub- ject the despicable mark of the world's scorn and reprobation, she consequently had no use for any, save the well-to-da in the world, and would shun the plea of the suffering poor, as she would the vi- per's sting. She had married to increase her wealth; and, when death took from her side the one she had vowed to love, - ay, love Ifor his gold, -no grief or bitter reflection pierced her unnatural heart. The "diamond widow" needed no long wooing; the richest of her suitors bore away the prize amid the hearty congratulations of friends, - and Helen Bierce had a-new mother. Within a year, Helen and her two brothers were sent North to school. Annually their father visited them; his wife never. Years passed. On a return trip from New York, the proud father led -his beautiful daughter, to her mother's, side, thinking, witless man, the admiration *      admrtin 1m   &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8265-00000049"/> "       EYE-'WITNESS. she everywhere elicited, would at least command re- spect from his heartless wife. But her charms so completely eclipsed the mother's, that no other emo- tion but intense jealousy was aroused, and she took no pains to conceal it. Helen had no love for the selfish being, who had made herself and her brothers aliens fromn home;, and, but for her father's urgent entreaty, would have never gone back to a roof, once hallowed by a fond mother's love, now overshadowed by the sin of a cor- rupt woman. Judicious training and education had much modi- fied Helen's imperious disposition; but the air of the North could not cool her, blood; and it was with many secret misgivings Mrs. Winn--the truly Christian lady to whose care she had been entrusted saw her young and gifted charge removed from the quiet seclusion of her own home, and gentle but firm restraint, to mingle with the world. Helen's return to-her father's house was sdon fol- lowed by that of her brothers. Ralph, the elder, was a cold, stern man. Had he been blessed with the, gentle care and cherishing love of the mother who bore him, instead of ]being left to 'the neglect of a mercenary Northern teacher, he would doubtless have been other than we have to portray him. How Helen's heart ached, when, the first fond greeting over, she saw the change years had wrought inber bold but generous-hearted brother. She had felt he was changed, for of late years his letters had grown strangely cold and short. She should see him, she thought, then all would be explained. But when they met, her pleading eyes, her tremulous voice, were passed by unnoticed; no assuring smile to ban-   EYE-WITNESS.        95 ish forebodings, no loving word came, only the chill- ing look, which silenced every inquiry his haughty reserve excited. To Willie, Helen turned, and in that fond heart found the ever-ready sympathy, the loving response her kindly-nature craved. Like his sister, 'William Bierce had found kind friends in his Northern- home, and now he had returned to his native State, to glad- den at least one heart there, -his sister Helen's. Very proud was the father of his boy, who had left the North, rejoicing in the high honors his cadet- ship at West Point had won; but his mother passed him by as she did his sister, having no use for such." "What has the North done to provoke the South to secede, do you ask, boy?" said Mr. Bierce to his son, who, to stop the storm of abuse, which was daily heaped upon him for not volunteering, had ventured the ques- tion. "What has the North done?" he repeated; "( look to her progressive usurpations, so long, so un- complainingly borne by us. What are they? Why, enormous tariffs, unconstitutional, oppressive, unjust, which fill Northern vaults with golden ingots, but beggar the South; the fishing bounty, which we pay, and New England Yankees reap; the navigation laws, which carry all trade to Northern marts, com- pelling us to go up thither to be swindled and jewed by the insane cupidity of a community, which has no higher aspiration than- commercial gain; and, more than all this, a people, who trample under foot the law, which requires the return from the Free States of fugitive slaves to their masters; send into our midst abolitionists, ' demons reared in the blackest smoke of hell,' to incite our slaves to rise and mur-   &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8265-00000050"/> 96   -    EYE-WITNESS. der us, our wives, and little ones, with the promise of our Jlads, if, the butchery is thorough and clean I This is what the North is- doing now, and has been /doing for years, arid what we say shall no longer be done  W We: have lifted our voice, but of no avail,- we-now- lift our hands,-- let the North beware " t.

A month later sees our prediction verified. Mr. Bierce had fitted out a privateer, and desired his son to command her. This he resolutely-refused to do; but, at the unceasing solicitation of his sister, he finally gave his consent to go as mate. ;The Pigeon " sailed mid the booming of cannon and shouts from the shore. Long after the crowd had dispersed, Helen Bierce walked the landing; she loved the sound of the waves, which had borne her Willie from her; softly lapping the wharf, where she stood, they seemed to bear away with them to the mighty deep, one a tear, another a sorrow, until the weight which crushed her heart was gone. With a last fond look turned upon the -anishing sails of the privateer, these words escaped her:- - a ',Do your duty fearlessly, Willie; I have done mine in urging you to this step, -and God bless us both."  The 4"Pigeon" had been but four days out, when the intrepid mate made the attempt to scuttle her. ' c( Better that all should perish," he said, " than lend themselves to piratical sins." :The attempt proved abortive. One night an alarm of fire rung through the ship; but, by the unwearied exertions of desperate men, she was saved. A day later the pilot was missing, and the "Pigeon" struck firm and fast on the bar ; but again the Evil One lent a helping hand and set her afloat. So much ill-luck did attend the fated ship, the desponding crew were about to set sail for'home for repars, when the cheer- 9 i,    &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8265-00000051"/> 98        EYE-WITNESS. ing cry of"Sail ho!" from the look-out, roused the crew's failing courage and fiendish instincts. With all sail set, the "Pigeon " bore down on the unarmed craft and silenced all opposition to entering a Southern port, by the show of formidable guns, Another white-winged victim fell into the power of that piratical crew, and the ' Pigeon ' set sail home with her valuable prizes. Since the disappearance of the pilot; so vigilant was the watch set, that young Bierce-was compelled to abandon- further, attempts to bring summary vengeance upon the-buccaneers. We next meet this brave, loyal soul in secesh liv- -ery, uraging home a besotted companion; and still again in the crowded Court-house, mistake those who were near, heard amid the fierce tumult of that morn- ing, his shout, -' The Union and Abe Lincoln for- ever!" as he went down amid the struggling, fight- ing mass, which sunk beneaththe broken floor. -When his manly form was drawn from the ruins, suffocation had done its work, - a black and stiffened corpse he lay I             .

The richness of her attire, however, lends no charm to her haughty, disturbed face. Vine, a spruce-looking quadroon chamber-maid, answers her violent summons. "Please, Missis, Miss Helen is busy, and can't come.           ' "( Go back, Vine, you nigger! and tell her I say, Come directly." Mrs. Bierce, always impatient of delay, was to- night more irritable than usual; and, as Vine still delayed, ,she sprung to the bell,-rope, exclaiming: ', Hateful niggers, I wish the North had every one of you! and you, Vine, I heard you whisper to Jane the other night,' it wasn't for long you'd have such a cross old- missis.' I'll see if you will use my name again in that way: these Yankee notions I shall take upon myself to whip out of you." Then looking at her watch, "you shall have your first lesson to- night, for Francis will not be at home for .two hours yet;" a;nd again she attacked the bell.

The pain and the sight of blood, which trickled down her white neck, roused all the passions of her turbulent nature, and at the sound of approaching footsteps, she sprung to the door, exclaiming, ', You shall smart for this, Vine!" After the duties of the day were over, Vine's cus- tom was to steal down to the servants' quarters and relieve herself of the day's budget of news. : Once she had been hired out, and during that time had secretly been taught to read. As she possessed a remarkably retentive memory, she. was eagerly sought after by the servants in the Square, who con- gregated at nights in some spacious kitchen or un- occupied hut, and in smothered tones talked of the Yankees coming to set them free, and of the North- ern homes made ready for them. This night the sable group is largerkthan usual; and, as Vine still. lingers in the big house, and the thought is forced home that she may- not come at all, their, dark faces grew frightfully ugly, as seen in the flickering light of -the pine knot on the hearth. From the look-out, near the barred door, the girl is discerned at length tripping down the steps; now lost in the shade of the elms, to emerge into the broad moonlight, which silvers the brick walk her swift feet scarcely touch. The door cautiously-opens, and, with low exclamations of delight, their oracle seats herself in their midst. "There," she cries, (" do hear Missis' bell! here, you, Zip, you go hold the clapper till Pse through, and here's a sixpence for you." Then turning to the group - -,Missis did n't mind the news much to-day, ;ru    EYE-WITNESS.        101 she's so full of her own self; but while I'se dressin' her hair, I used my eyes handy. The Yankees is comin', every one of them, to kill, every man that's got niggers; the North is fighting for the niggers and nobody else; they swear they can whip the South all to nothin', and we shall be free and fine as white folks. There! I read them very words, and every one is as solemn and true as these big bumps. See here (stripping-up her sleeve) ,this is what I gets for what Missis calls laziness. When I reads the good news, I forgets my fingers, but not long; it takes Missis to scatter a pretty dream." A sympathet- ic groan from the dusky audiepce has the desired ef- feet, and Vihe is to-night more garrulous than ever; and, after telling all she knew, and a great deal which was' only conjecture, she finished, "saying: "And Miss Helen won't stay here no longer. I saw Kizzie packing her trunk, arid she told me she was going away with young missis, and neither of them was coming back no more.   Poor Miss Helen! Massa William's death has wellnigh killed her; old massa ought to be hanged for looking so cross at her as he does, because- she would n't swear to somethin'- about that abolition man. Hark'I if there is n't his call now for Jim, and I must cut for missis' room. Golly! what a tearing rbge she's in! but who cares for Missis when Massa's here." With a merry laugh Vine left the group, and, spinning the promised sixpence at the -head of Zip, who, perched upon a chair in the long hall, was with his might doing her bidding, she bounded up the broad flight of stairs, which led to her mistress' room, with the fleetness of a gazelle. To return to Mrs. Bierce, whom we -left in no -en-  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8265-00000053"/> 102       EYE-WITNESS. viable state of mind, awaiting her maid's reappear- ance., She was near the door when it opened, and her-daughter entered, " So you Wve come at last!  she screamed, asshe seized Helen, in her blind fury, mistaking her for Vine, who was but a shade darker, and quite as fresh looking ;- "C I'll skin you alive! I will! and we'll see if your master dares--" "Unhand me, woman I Are you mad, that you take me for Vine? 'e Helen's voice calmed the enraged being before her; she quickly dropped her arm, and staggered to a chair. "I thought you were Vine, Helen," she said at length. "You know you do resemble a nigger; oh my poor head (by way of covering her face to escape the withering look which was cast upon her) "( why don't you .hand me something to ease it? ' Helen did not move; very white and calm she stood, tapping the floor with her slippered foot. Presently she said:-- ,' I: came here at your bidding; what is your wish??' ,c I sent for you some half hour since, that I might be the: bearer of the good tidings, that your father has signified his consent to overlook the past, and take to his heart his Helen, so becomingly dressed in the work of her own hands;" - then scanning her closely " all the colors of the rainbow, well stirred up in cotton web, is truly appropriate mourning for your dear Willie; but no matter, so long as the scantinesst of- material finely displays the contour of so voluptuous a form!" and a; light, mocking laugh followed the taunting words. But words and laugh- ter fell alike unheeded upon the silent girl. Thor-   YEE-WITNESS.        103 oughly provoked by Helen's passive indifference, her merciless tormentor then hurled her' bitter venom at the only vulnerable spot,-so sinful a tongue could reach, - her affection for her deceased brother.' "( Hold, woman!," she, cried, tortured beyond all endurance " Speak not that sacred name here. I have borne insults from you long and patiently for my father's sake, but that is over now; this is the last night we spend beneath the same roof. I go, and you have the joy, if so depraved a heart can experience such an emotion, of seeing the complete 'consumma- tion of all your projects; I go' from my fathers roof, fully resolved never to enter his house again, while you are its mistress."   - Not caring to witness the triumphant smile, which she. knew her words would awaken, Helen turned, from the room. A -'she left the door, Vine entered by another into her mistress' presence, and, before Helen could reach her own room, a sound, which could not be mistaklen, followed by a heavy fall, made her turn quickly upon her steps, and re-enter the boudoir. At the same moment a carriage drove up to the house, and a gentleman and lady alighted. '( Helen, dear Helen, look up I Am I not wel- cqme?"  The sweet, soft voice of Maggie Blout aroused the suffering girl; she raised her colorless face, exclaim- in : "Maggie, is it you'?  Thank:God, I have some one near to ease my breaking heart."  The approach of morn had awakened -:light's drowsy sentinels, and, with a will, they were cheerily lifting the curtains' of the eastern chamber, when  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8265-00000054"/> 104 u      EYE-WITNESS. Maggie and her cousin rode away from Mr. Bierce's dwelling.  During their drive home, Harry Blout heard from Maggie the-fearful scene which, a few hours before, had been enacted in the house they had just left.' "Was the girl much injured?" he asked. Yes; but Dr. Hall thinks, with pPoper care, she may eventually recover; she is to be removed to the hospital to-day. Helen has been prevailed upon to remain at home; consequently, uncle Francis and his wife leave immediately for the country; and, as Vine not infrequently attends them on their journeys, her absence wills not be remarked. When they return, some kind of a story will be gotten up,- either that she was too saucy to keep and was sold, or she sickened and died, and so the matter will drop. O Harry, what greater evil could be visited upon man than slavery? It is truly a foe to religion, a de- spoiler of morality, and, as we have proof, almosto daily, makes the master, be he man, woman, or child, a despot of the highest grade. God grant, if this war must be, that it may ultimatelyY and com- pletely do away with slavery.'  A- few hours later and Harry was gone; - but Mag- gie still lingered at the window, from which she had leaned, to wave a last adieu as the cars swept by. I shall come back, Maggie," lingered upon the lips of the one, whose dark eye moistened as he re- turned the loving salute; and Maggie felt his last words were prophetic.   CHAPTER XIV. ESCAPE OF MRS. WEASEL-FINDS A FRIEND. ON the following morning, Maggie was awakened before light by her servant. "Dare was a woman down stairs," she said, " dat wants to see missis." "Who can she be?" exclaimed the startled girl. "She did n't give no name, missis; but she 'pears awful anxious like." ,' Did she come alone?," , No, missis; she has a boy wid her. See, har's a slip o' paper for you."         l Maggie glanced at the few words, then skid, hur- riedly, "Tell the good lady to, come here directly, - but stay; who admitted these strangers?" "AMe let 'em in; no other soul don't know they's har." "I am so glad, aunty, and do not speak of this to anyone."  ," Neber you fear, Missis; old Liz is as black as the grave and as hush, too.; she neber tells nobody's secrets and she'd diet all ober 'fore she'd tell yer's." "I know it, aunty; arid now that the time has come for great caution, your wise eyes and open ears must be my hedge. Go. now and bring the lady and boy here; there is work for us both, and we must-be about it."  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC8265-00000055"/> 106       EYE-WITNESS. Nothing pleased the old servant so well, as to be told she was of much account to her mistress; and the thought that she looked to her to fill master Harryv's place, sent the rheumatic old body spinning down the broad stair-case as if youthful vigor and not infirm old age turned the key of locomotion. Lizzie,-or aunt Lizzie, as Maggie'loved to call her, -was ripe in years and good works; she had been a faithful nurse to Maggie s mother, and ajt her dying bedside had received into her arms her infant daughter. 4'Promise me, Lizzie," said the sinking mopther, ' that -you will be to my babe what you harveever been to me, and I die happy ;" the mother heard ithe promise given, and on the devoted servant and her charge, her last, fond gaze rested. A mother's love and servant's fidelity were repaid by the strong affection Maggie ever manifested for hier black nurse;- and when, after her father's death, -she told Lizzie she was to be free, with money enough to live comfortably on, the remainder of her days, the-old nurse fell on her knees aind begged her young mistress to let her serve her alwsays she was rich enough, happy enough, she said, in dear missis's house, where she had promised dead missis to live for lherbabe arnd die for it, if the Lord willed.  Maggie, finding all remonstrance vain, finally told her she should never leave her; and that she might take the money she- -had :reserved for her, and buy her huesbag if she could ; and so old Jake was free. He:hired lmself out in the city, spending his Sundays with his yife and filling is heart With the praises ofw youg-Missis, which Lizzie's tongue never tired to tfter. A "Should violent hands be laid on you or yours, ^  *   ^         .'    ',   EYE-WITNESS        107 Maggie,' said Harry, on leaving, 'you need no more doughty champion than Aunt Lizzie." "And Jake?" said Maggie, ' is as honest as Lizzie, for all I know; he certainly possesses a fair share of her, sagacity, and the fact of your having purchased his freedom, secures you a powerful ally in -him; and be sure nothing in which you are concerned can transpire in the city, without his being conversant with and publishing it here.' But to return to Lizzie. Not long, and with the lady and her child, she reentered her mistress' room. Maggie's charming ease of manner, and the-kind sympathy, her words and looks evinced, soon drew from the stranger the cause of her flight, and the imminent danger, which threatened her, should her steps be traced. Calmly Mrs. Weasel spoke of the atrocities practised upon herself and family, because her husband refused to volunteer,--as well as all demands to equip troops. "When he was arrested," she said, because of hislIUnion principles, and thrown into jail, I could not murmur, for I felt he was safer in prison than out of it. With my children, I soughts shelter in an untenanted house of my husband's; but my persecutors found me there, and made my:life wretched with abuse; I should utterly have failed in courage, had it not been for a kind stranger, who heard of my distress and visited me. Through him I heard of my husbarid's well-being, and of the- successful flight of my brother, Dr. Brawn, with his family from the State. I speak of this noble young man to you freely, for I know he is- your cousin."   , "Neither are you unknown to me," said Maggie; ("I have heard Harry speak Of you often; and now,  .         -   &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC8265-00000056"/> 108       EYE-WITNESS. -that he is no longer here to assist you, you must let me be your friend and protector." t' He told me to come to you in my extremity,"- for the first-time her voice trembled, - I little thought it would--be so soon." "Don't ery, mamma," said the boy, who, with his head on' his mother's knee, had been intently listening to what she had related, - "I will tell the lady all the rest,-it makes you cry so." -Maggie drew the little- fellow to her side, and, smoothing his bright curls, said: "Yes, you shall t'ell me what has happened;, then I shall know how best-to aid-you." With childish eagerness, but with his eyes fixed upon his mother's bowed face, he said :, "Mamma told Cora, that's little sisj, and me, that when Mr. Blout's regiment went away, we should come to town to see him off; Mr. Blout was good to us, good almost as papa, and a great deal richer, I know." "( How do you know that?"Maggie asked. -' He gave mamma a heap of money, and when she would n   Ittaike it, he gave it to sis and me; it was a whole' hundried; papa never gave ,us more than dollars, sometimes only shillings. Well, sis and me were upl before, mamna waked, and were in the -ity by sunrise; we promised, faithfully, we would keep out of .he streets and stay hid, just where I knew the cars went through.. I knew all about the cars, for I went with papa to Raleigh oncp. We had been hid a long time when we heard some music; then we knew the cars were coming. We were covered up by some alder-bushes, but we saw Mr. Blout lean from the car window and/ wave something white; Cora jumped up and threw the flowers we had picked, ;o ,r4f   EYE-WITrESs.       109 at him; he saw us, laughed, and kissed his hand, then the train was gone. "Sis cried a little, but I told her papa- said it was n't brave to cry, and she hushed; we picked honey- suckles awhile, then we got tired and fell-asleep. Sis' crying woke me up, but I found I could rnot: move, my hands and feet were tied with vines. A heap of boys were teasing Cora, pulling her hair, pinching her and tearing her frock; they' were dreadful mean boys. I went- to school where they did once, and they called me such bad names, and beat me . so, papa took me away, and said I hould go to school no more, until these bad times were over. Papa says, I am a strong boy for one of my age; I know I was pretty strong that time, for t snapped the vines almost as large as my thumb, and got at my knife, and cut them -from my feet. I had my pistol- in -my pocket, -papa gave it to me, and- taught me' how to shoot too, -and I ran up to Jack White, and told him I'd shoot him if he kicked sis again. He said he'd kicked her three times, and should kick the Yankee brat 'till she was dead." Just as he raised his foot I put up my pistol and shut my eyes ;'after thee noise, I looked, and Jack lay on the ground very still." "Oh, myI son," groaned the weeping mother, "God would have punished him." ' "He did, mamma; when I shut my eyes, I asked- him to aim for me, and the shot went right into Jack; the boys all run -away then, and I went-up to Jack; I was glad he did n't move, for I had no more shot-for him if he should hurt Cora again. She was, bleeding awful, and, when I attempted to move her, she shivered all over. I saw a man coming up:the road in a buggy; I stopped him, and asked-him:to, 10  */                  --   &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8265-00000057"/> "O       EYE-WITNESS. take Sis home, she was so sic. He got down and went into the woods .a little way; Cora had stopped groaning tl-en, and never did anything, when he put. his hand on her, and afterward bound up her head with' his handkerchief. Whien he saw Jack White, he-stepped up to where he lay; he said, he thought the boy was dead, and asked me ( who shot him?' I told him, ' he kicked Cora until she fell down, and saidt he would kill her; then I shot him.' ' Served him right, the scamp,' he said, and called me a brave boy; then he, asked me whose children we were, and, when I told him, he turned quickly to his horse saying, ( Go home, and tell your mother all; Cora is badly hurt, but I will take good care of her, and drive round after night, and tell her how she is.' I Fran with all my might, but had n't got through telling mamma, when we saw some men coming down the road horseback; mamma said, they were coming to the house. We fastened the doors and windows, and she took, papa's revolver, and I my pistol, and we waited for them; they soon came up. Iv saw Jack White's father; he jumped -down first, and came to the door;, they all tried the door, and swore awful, because mamma would not open for 'them. She told them, they must tell her what they came for. They talked about me, and said they had come to get us both, Mamma said, she should fire upon the first one who broke into the house.. But they did n't seem  one bit afraid; I reckon they did n't know what a revolver she had. One man broke through the door, just where we were. He had got all in but one leg, when mamma fired, but it didn't hit him. I heard some one groan, though, outside of the door, where the ball went through.

I struck at it with my  pistol,/-and the revolver fell to the floor. As the man reacheddotwn, for it, mamma put out her foot; it went off, and the man rolled over on to the floor. Then-we kept very still, to see what the men on the outside would  do next. As we could hear nothing, we crept to the door, and I heard them call mamma a devil, and hay the house was full of them, and they must set a guard about it, and send off to the city for more men. They shouted for Bill White, but he did nt answer, then one of them rode away. Two only were eft, one was on the verandah and the other in the garden behind the house. Mamma whispered to me to load my pistol; that she was going to get out f the house and hide in the woods until night; but first, she said, she must frighten the guard away. She-went up to the man on the floor and took the revolver out of his-hand, and another bigger than, that out of his belt. She fired rilght smart, and the man in the garden ran as she said he would, andwe escaped from the house; crawled through the ditch in the {garden and reached the woods unseen.

"And ,this is all?" said Maggie with a deep sigh, pressing the little fellow to her side. A- large tear on the boy's hand, made him look up, and the sympathy he read in those eyes, turned so lovingly upon him, made him bold -to say, ,' Please ma'am, may the black woman give me something to eat? I had no dinner, nor no supper, all yesterday." Lizzie entered, at this moment, with the --morn- ing's meal, which she spread temptingly before the wanderers. Only after the most urgent entreaty, was Mrs.- Weasel prevailed upon to break her long fast; while Percy, overcame with excitement and fatigue, fell asleep with his food untasted; one hand holding the sweet cake his- hungry stomach craved, but which the weary mouthl refused to admit. There Maggie and her guest sat long after the sun was up, the one comforting, the other growing strong with the bold confidence her hostess expressed, rela- tive to her own and her children's safety in her house. The mother's heart throbbed once more with hope, when she" learned there were many in the city, as true to the Union as her husband and herself. c The influence of wealth and position now," said Maggie, (' Secures them from sufferings. such as you have experienced, but let success crown another raid of the Rebels and all, who refuse to take up arms in defence of Southern rights, will be condemned as traitors and treated as such.

HATT, was a man whom every one knew and honored, but no one feared. Secesh, respected him for his wealth and unbounded influence, and he duped them; Union men, denounced, penniless wan- derers, sought him and were fed from his table, sup- plied with his gold, and by his keen sagacity helped out of the State; while forsaken wives and fatherless children blessed the good Samaritan, who, all un- known, kept the'heart warm with shining messengers, ,which fed, housed, and clothed them. ' On issuing from the' sick-room he met Maggie. 4 C.'I've seen your patient," he said, "-and find * you've minded me to the letter; he's twenty per cent better than his case promised yesterday;" then bending down to her ear he whispered, , its well he's mending; I'm mistaken, or another dawn finds him out of these snug quarters i I tell you they are again- on his track, fiercer, than ever! one of the d--- rascals told me, this morning, the Yankee Whedden wasn't in town, and this day's work was to scour the suburbs! that's what brought me here, say, now, are you ready for them?"

"Can't hear, can't hear, time is- too precious to listen to a woman's rattle," and putting his hands to his ears, Dr. Hall began to ascend the stairs leading to the attic. ', But- you must -hear,. doctor,"' and the resolute girl laid a firm, detaining hand upon his shoulder. Dr. Hall turned, and reading the determination in her face, gave' a low whistle; then patting her flushed cheek,- said: "Blaze away I Maggie, I pity your sweetheart when you get up such a look as this." " Have you heard of a Mr. White's being shot?" Maggie asked, in a sharp; quick voice.

When the house was broken ;open, White was found mortally wounded, and one of his accomplices not much better off in a room adjoining the one where White lay.

"Yes, she is in this house; she wandered  all night in the woods with her boy, and reached here before sunrise." Dr. Hall dropped the arm, which he had grasped; and with his thumbs in the arm-sizes- of his waistcoat, gave expression to his dumb-foundedness in" ( shucks" vociferously uttered. Recovering from his surprise, and rubbing his hands, he cried - ( Glad of it! glad of it I I'll father that woman and her young ones; just the right kind of material to spill" one's blood for H-a life for a life. - I'm in for that -now!"            - "' Shall we come to that to-day? doctor."

The leader of the band of detectives, who thus assailed her- house, was Ralph Bierce. His cold, searching gaze was returned withkaughty surprise by Maggie, who, declining the proffered chair, said - "Cousin Ralph, is it thus you enter my house, after so many long years of absence?

"And do you, and your armed friends, look to a defenceless woman's house as a rendezvous for such ?" asked Maggie. " It w-as reported, that Richard Whedden was among the number crushed to death the morning of the trial; but information has been received, that he still lives; to seek himi, we are here, as it is quite natural: to suppose that he has friends in neighbors so contiguous to his former residence."  (You have the right to draw such conclusions as you please," Maggie replied, coldly, " but those who knew aught of Mr. Whedden, knew that he led the life of a recluse." " You have more knowledge of him, I see, than we," Ralph said, looking fixedly at her, "andwe now proposb to pursue our search here.?' "Ralph, if my father were living, I should not be subjected to such an insult; his good name should spare his 'daughter the indignity of being treated as an abettor of sin in any guise."   1 - - r   EYE-WAi'INESS.   119   "It is not to offer personal affront, but to satisfy the people, that we search here." I understand, perfectly, the popular voice sanctions the outrage of even our most sacred rights. Unprotected women, like myself, have no power to resist an armed force; but I do insist, that what you do here you do-quickly; my servant will take the keys and open the house for youw inspection, with the exception of my own chamber,   that, no strange foot shall enter." The dignified, determined manner of the lady of the house checked any expression of opposition, which her words might have aroused; as she left the room, Ralph Bierce turned to his men saying "Miss Blout is above suspicion; to save a scene, we will allow her the undisturbed seclusion of her own room." And the search began; up stairs, down stairs; from the crannies in the attic to the coal-hole in the basement was heard    the tread of heavy feet. Stables, barns, orchard, grove and garden,, were swept clean by busy, sin-blinded eyes, but nothing came of it-; and the watchers in the room fronting the street saw the heated, foiled band move off towards the city.  " Why does n't Ralph go ?" said Maggie, in a low voice to an elderly lady, who knelt by her side at the window; " he certainly can expect no civilities from me." At a low tap at the door, Maggie rose and drew the bolt. Lizzie entered; this is the substance of her story: - "The man with black whiskers had followed her from the roof to the dog-kennel, from the parlor to  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8265-00000062"/> 120       EYE-WITNESS. the servants' quarters, opening closets, stripping beds, and overturning couches, until '-nothin' 'taint as t was;- but, said Lizzie,- shaking with suppressed laughter, ;"Massa Harry '1! match 'em for't, when he comes back." "-Go son, what then?" said Maggie, impatiently. "Dey jest questioned me and Jake all to pieces, but we did n't know nothin'," "Jake, here? to-day," asked Maggie, "Yes, missis, he-followed de men har." "Well, what did you do after the men left, Lizzie?             -  "I -stole out to whar de sick man lay, and found him as comfortable like, as if he had n't no enemy in:  de world; and de little boy neber looked handsomer, ,den I saw him dar, playing Wid two owlets, he'd found in de nest ober his head." "Thank heaven! they are safe as yet," said Maggie. Her companion made no; remark, but behind her glasses great tears gathered, but were not allowed to fall. Brave, suffering mother, only trust, and the sorrows and pangs of earth's night shall be ex- changed for the eternal day, and the crown, which even now angal hands are twining for the faithful, that endure puto the end. 1 . ,       /   CHAPTER XVI. A STORK AND ITS EFFECTS. THE hall-bell sounded; Lizzie answered- the summons, and returned' sqaying, 'Massa Bierce wanted missis," -" , Inufferable! monstrous -I is he not satisfied with searching my  house I go back, Lizzie, and tell Ralph Bierce, your mistress will receive, through er servant, any message he has to deliver; but stay: I know Ralph's nature so well, my refusing to see him} will only delay is departure. I will - go this once, she said rising, and mind, Lizzie, open this dor to no one but your mistress. Ann will attendme. On dscendiang, she met Ralph in the halli he: was  coldly polite, as before; butit required a masterl control of her feelings to retain the haughty ai- difference she assumed, while listening to hls acwount of the fruitless search, when she heard him declare, with perfect nonchalance, his determination to take. up his abode in her spacious house. 'The situa- tion," he said, 4; was the most desirable the county round for himself and men; it afforded greater facil- ities for perfecting their plans, than any other, which could be-found." Maggie knew that his gaze was upon her; that -he was trying to read her very soul, and, with almoSt u- perhuman effort' she checked every expression, in-word A '-  ^:   :-   .S, '  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC8265-00000063"/> 122  -     EYE-WiESS. or, look, which might betray her trepidation and intense indignation. ( Her house to be made a den of robbers!'" she thought, -" her presence to be polluted by the leader of a gang of men tainted witl treason, whose souls, crime had darkened until they were blacker than* the smoke of the homes their hands had fired! I cannot suffer this outrage," and she remembered the promise she had made Harry. "Vengeance is mine, "  I will be a father to the fatherless," came to her throbbing heart; her hand dropped to her side, and she grew calm and firm; raising her eyes to Ralph's -face, she said- "This house is dear to me; it is sanctified by my parents' lives; ,dying they bequeathed-it to me:; before it shall become the rendezvous-of lawless men, I will \ lay it in ashes, and go with my servants into --the woods; and upon you, Ralph Bierce; shall rest the vengeance of a God, whose protecting care is the orphan's.- "' Cousin Margaret, you mistake my meaning; it is my iptention to be here certain hours of the day, I and the nights, of course; there are buildings near, for my men: and I can promise you, no depredations shall be perpetrated by them; on the contrary, they will be very efficient aid in protecting your property from the predatory excursions. of runaways, who infest the woods below." -Then, speaking more deliberately,:-. c I should certainly regret seeing this fine house in ruins, but should not hesitate to raze it to- the ground myself, should it prove an asylum for traitors, such as Richard Whedden or the murderer of Bill White.": ' And do you, who have shot down unarmed men inh the street, and followed up your persecutions with   EYE-WITNESS.       123 fire and insults the cruelest, come with unwashen haisds to my door and cry aloud for more victims! If my house were- an asylum for such, think you I would give them up? Never! I would fight for them, with them, until these rooms flowed with our blood." "t See to it, Margaret,' that you hold your house free from proscribed heads; and keep such sentiments to yourself, or your life will answer for it," Ralph said; and he turned upon his heel and left the house. "Oh! if Harry were only here I " sighed Maggie, as she ascended the stairs. "Ralph looked strangely at me; can it be that his penetrating eyes read my inmost thoughts! how strange he should have men- tioned this White affair, --he will come back!- oh!  what will become of us?" and she rested her aching head upon -the balustrade, as if her resolute spirit fainted within her. Suddenly she thought, ,' I have Dr. Hall to consult, why need I fear?" and with a bounding step she gained her chamber door. On being-admitted, with forced gayety she exclaimed- "'All right as yet, dear Mrs. Fay, (the name, cap, spectacles, and dress assumed, making the. hunted mother a nice-looking-elderly lady)- come' now and help me to uncage my bird." The two approaching the dressing-room, tapped gently, and, at gruff tones of welcome, entered, to find Dr. Hall well armed, and complacently whiling away the tedium  of solitary confinement with his meerschaum.  .   .   -. While Maggie related the events of the past two hours, he nodded most approvingly, but when she repeated the conversation held with Ralph, he burst in'; "Who in the----plays us false? there's a spy  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8265-00000064"/> EYE-WITNESS.  among ius! call up the niggers! let me catch the culprit, and 'll skin him alive I " Pomp, Lizzie, and Ann are all I have here now, and they are as true as steel," Maggie said. ^" There's mischief in one of them, call them up! I say, call them up! But what 's this?" raising the curtain, " rain, by my soul! ILook here, a storm is on us! -to the swamp  all hands of you I he's a dead man if he gets a soaking." Too late! the storm was already upon them, for when they reached the hall door the rain fell in tor- rents. CStay here!" cried the doctor to the hesitating group; " when I want you, I will signal from the tree; the storm is a mad one, but it will soon spend itself."  Then wrapping his rubber cape about him, be sprung with flying leaps towards the garden. They saw- him reach the grove beyond, then the blinding rain shut him from view. The blankets were folded and laid ready for use; the servants bidden to keep strict watch for signals from the swamp, and then Maggie, placing the arm of her friend within her own, drew her gently into the hall, saying- "Let us be patient; such a storm cannot last long; brave little Percy can weather it, I know." "Not of my child, but of the pick man I am thinking,"was the rejoinder; "it would be dreadful to have him prostrated by fever again; and he 'is so exposed." " Only until Dr. Hall reaches there," said Maggie, cheerfully, "' his rubber cape can quite cover the nest, and keep them all as dry as bob-o-link's nest- lings under his feathery coat. We will sit here, and   while we are watching the storm, I will tell you what a nice nest that is, and what two old birds own it. Beyond the grove is the swamp, which separates Mr. Whedden's grounds from these. Once Cousin Harry, while hunting, quite lost himself in that almost im- penetrable growth of reeds and underbrush, and only after severe labor, succeeded in reachiing a cleared place. There an immense sweet gum-tree towered, and by its side was a pine. Sorne twenty feet from the -ground these trees locked trunks, and mingled their boughs, forming a hollow capable of hoIding two persons comfortably. Harry has had a path cleared through the swamp so circuiiously, I would defy any one, without a pilot, to find it. In o6i nest, (Harry and I claim it,) that is in the bosom of the sweet gum and pine, Pomp laid Mr. Whedden; and there, too, is Percy, who- Pomp said, laughed at our vine ladder and climbed the pine like a, cat.. But see," she added, rising, (' the clouds are lifting; we shall soon see signs from the exiles; " and the two stepped out on the veranda.  True, the rain was falling slowly, and bright patches of blue were seen overhead; but the black clouds piling in the south, which they did not see, foretokened a storm fiercer than the one just passing away. There were no signals; and by night a tempest raged. Objects, within the house and without, were whitened by the blinding light; while thunder-claps, the raging wind, and' sounding rain held each heart hushed and awed.  " Every room, which faces the swamp, is brilliantly lighted; they shall see that we are thinking of them," whispered Maggie, as she turned from the door and  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8265-00000065"/> 126r EYE-WITNESS. bent over the chair in which Mrs. Fay sat, with ,her bead bowed upon her hands. A flasli, followed by a startling clip, told those fear-smitten hearts that something n6ar the house-had been struck, "On the lawn! missis," cried Lizzie, and Maggie followed her servant to the hall door. Up shot the fierce flames about a grand old oak not fifty yards from the house.  "That shot was a fair one," growled the storm- king to his swarming hosts, whose panting breath tossed golden streamers and banners of dazzling light aloft; "one more- charge and the revel is done." Another thunderbolt smote near, and a light beyond- the grove drew the household to the east  veranda.  Red, bright, and fierce rose the rioting flames, seeming to lick the thunderous concave overhead. The sweet' gum!" groaned Marggie, and she turned in speechless agony to the mother.   CHAPTER XVII. THE PATIENT AND BOY SAVED.!    - "NOT so near! not so near! missis, call your boy "  "Percy! dear Percy! where are you " but no answer came; the flames crackled and roared, and the cry was lost. "Dey are in de canes, no signs of dem har."' Yes, for the mother's eye has caught something; she darts amid a shower of blazing sticks, and springs back unharmed.  A small singed cap she presses to her lips, while tears pour down her cheeks. i"See, a paper!"  he cries, and she unpins the scorched scrap from within' the cap. "We are safe; come to the ;-   ," she reads, then a fierce gust whirls the paper from her trem- bling 'hand; it is drawn towards the flames,; again the fearless woman springs upon the burning fagots, but reaches her arms in vain. "It is gone!" she cries, as all ablaze it was whirled aloft, and fell, senseless.  An hour before tmidnight two men appear ap- proaching the house, bearing a .third; Lizzie and Ann follow, carrying a happy smiling mother, who holds her boy by the hand. Thougha her limbs are badly blistered, she heeds them not; for her heartA s overflowing with joy, that the lost are found. She  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8265-00000066"/> EYE-WITNESS. smiles bravely as the doctor dresses the fierce burns, and, when on leaving, he takes her hand and calls her a brave woman, a tear is obn his cheek. "A cold in head," he mutters, and dashes his hand across his face. Ah I: no.  Not a cold in the head, kind soul, for that was pity's tear, which 8o noble a heart as yours, Dr. Felix Hall, needt not be ashamed to own. "Now,    aie," he Said, when ihd two stood on the steps out in the night,  I shall call in during the d'a; to pay mny respects to your cousin Ralph.

", A capital suggestion !" cried the doctor, glee- fully,  I'll meet Frank at the. station and send him here; next to Harry Blout, Maggie, y  ou ld not have a wiser or 'a cooler head to consult with; he's a man after my own heart, firm arid true as steel." Dr. Hall was right. Before breakfast was served, a clattering of hoofs was heard on the drive, and, as Maggie turned to the window, she saw Ralph;and two of his men in the act of dismounting, and sigh- ing deeply, she left the room.  Some hours later she sent for Ralph to meet her in the parlor; and on his appearance, after a few commonplace remarks, with a forced smile she asked, "if he had any choice of rooms?"    The smile vanished, however, when he replied  /  : ,, The one front, which you objected to my enter- ing yesterday, wduld suit my purpose best." " That room is mine; it will remain so," Maggie replied. "Very well. I will occupy the one opposite; the view is, perhaps- equally as good.". ", That one I have reserved for Mr. McGowan, a gentleman I expect here to-day." ( Excuse me, I understood you to ask if I had a choice; j is restricted to what you have not already appropriated, I see. However, a room is of small motnent; you spoke of Mr. McGowan; is it Frank McGowan of Whiteville?" The same," Maggie said, more eagerly than she was conscious of. "Is he a relative?"  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC8265-00000067"/> 130       EYE-Wi'TSNSS. "A distant one; although I call him cousin." co A valued friend? perhaps." "Yes-. Do you know him?" ', I know somewhat of him, and can safely say he vill not hbe here to-day." "Why? '" -"I read in this morning's paper, that a man, answering to such a name, was arrested last evening, whilte on his way to this city, for expressing senti- -ments decidedly obnoxious to his travelling com- panions. The paper did not state what, but it seems enough was said to have him passed up the road to Salisbury.. At this moment Maggie was called from the room. With her usual grace) she crossed the long parlor; but the hall gained, and that stabbing voice lost to her tortured senses, she could restrain her feelings no longer.      ,  'I , Anything, "Lizzie,' she whispered, " only- leave me undisturbed for an hour." Lizzie looked into her mistress' face and forbore to make her request. She saw her enter the library; then clinching her huge hand she shook it before the open parlor door, muttering- "Yer'll kill 'er I yer old sarpent, if Massa Harry stays up yonder many more days! but I've swared to save her, and old black Liz. will do it!"   CHAPTER XVLL.     , INTRODUCING NaW onT'RAOC'rIKS. INTO one of the few handsome residences which grace the antiquated town of -Whiteville, let me transport you; reader. The house and its surround- ings bespeak wealth, and the cultivated taste of -the- owner. Our attention, however,- is drawn to tthe two persons who sit busily sewing upon the veranda, The elder is a noble-looking lay of some forty years; her face is expressive of goodness -and eauty; her eyes are full and earnest, and her smile, irresist- ibly winning. Those who knew Mrs. McG9owan most intimately, wondered how one bred in an atmosphere of pride and ultra refinement, could, so unreservedly, associate with theless favored ones, among whom, in later years, her lot wys cast. It was the Christian loveliness of her character, which endeared her alike to all, even the most prej4udiced of her neighbors, who, on her advent among them, declared --c They had no use for aristo;ratic Vir- ginians; too fine ladies for their town; for all athey could see they were as good as she, if not quite ap ladyish," &amp;c:, &amp;c.  The young girl at her side is her daughter; she has the same full eye and wavy brown ha   h } iher  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC8265-00000068"/> 132   :    EYE-WITaESS. features are regular, with a liveliness of expression, which portrays every change doffeeling. "Do see! mamma,"   she exclaimed petulantly, "how this thread will knot; if I were sewing for the Yankees, -my needle would go as smoothly as Aunt Lucy's shuttle." "',You would be less troubled, my daughter, if you would take more interest in. your work, and not' keep your eyes on the road so intently"  ', Nothing ever came of an attempt to accomplish, a thing the heart does not sanction; so good by- homespun ; some one else will have to sew for Jeff. Davis's soldiers, I can't longer." Annie tossed her work into her maid's lap, and, springing to her feet, clapped her hands for her pony, capering near. His attention caught, she pointed at the post, where the, saddle hung, then at the coachman. Away trotted the docile creature, and taking the saddle between his teeth bore it to the stable and laid it carefully down at the groom's feet. ,' Quick! John," shouted the little lady, 's and do you saddale the mare and accompany, me." ,then dropping her voice, she thus soliloquized - "Once in the woods and I can sing' Red, White, and Blue,' and ' John Brown,' to my heart's content. Mamma has never heard the latter; I believe I will surprise her with one stanza." Annie's voice was of singular sweetness and rare compass; and the verse was sung with such effect, as to draw many an ebon face from tasks assigned. With "Glory  , Glory, Hallelujah" still on her lip, she turned to note the effect of tabooed patriotism upon her mother, when, to her great discomfiture, she discerned one of their neighbors approaching.   EYE-WITNESS.         133 Thinking to escape observation she bent low behind some flowering shrubs near, whispering to herself: , If there is n't old lady Prue! I do wonder what she comes here for; it was only last week she said the McGowans were all Yankees and ought to be put in jail;- despicable secesh! I wish such as you would stay  away from those you affect to despise i" ,Annie," said her mother; but the young girl was too intent with her own plans, for the most consistent treatment to be tendered  an avowed enemy, to heed; at the second bidding, however, she arose and -walked deliberately up to the caller in the deep fly-bonnet. "How do you do?  irs. Prue," she said, extend- ing her hand. "How d'y, Miss Ann? I'm tolerable, are you well?" "Quite so; and your family?" "Are al1 up, I believe." The usual salutatory remarks over, Annie seated herself where she could escape her mother's eye and any gestures she might make by way of caution. Mrs. :Prue, at her hostess' request, laid aside the fly-bonnet, and drew her hoopless skirts about her; then, as her custom was, took from-her pocket a smalls tin box and brush. "Have a dip, Mrs. McGowan?     May be you have -a brush of your own." , Thank you, Mrs. Prue, but I never dip." * * This custom of dipping is almost universal at the-South,- - high and low, rich and poor, mistress and slave, practise it. The  slave makes the brush for her mistress by Chewing a little:tang. of a certain kind of wood, until the end is like a fine -soft bmah.: 12  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC8265-00000069"/> -134 -      -EYE-WITNESS. " But, Miss Ann, you will!? and the gill of mac- a boy was extended to 'the right. (','I -av'etn'any brush," said Annie, with well- feigned ygret, "I suppose you would n't use mine?" "MY daughter never dips," Mrs. McGowan quietly remarked. "' Well! well! neither of you dip? It 's a mighty fortunate thing these days. Snuff is growing so high ;it's a dollar a pound now, and hard to get at that. Whbat we are all coming to, if the Yankees dont stop this fuss soon, I can't for the life of me tell." The destruction which threatens, is appalling, certainly.      .  6"Yes, Mrs. .]McGrowan, bread and meat may be scarce; :money, however, will purchase food, and you and I have nothing to fear on that score; but laws-a- me! snuff, it can't be had in the Southern Confederacy two months longer-! It is bread and meat to me, and it :s something I can't do without." "HAVe yeou sent to Our larger cities, for it?" "Yes, verywhere in the State, but it can't be had,'" said rs, Prue, most despondingly. t"Why not grind up tobacco and put salt with it? our nigger do so'; a said Annie. Why , child, -it would be strong enough to starot every to6th in my head!

"e No, and, they say, they wont come until she has dropped them Yankee airs she has; but for my part, I can't see but she appears just the same as if she had n't been up to New York." "I am sure if Annie's young mates- should visit her, they would fndher no more changed than you and I." "They see her at church, they says and that's enough for them; them pink roses on the top of her bonnetrand on the inside too, they hate, they are so Yankeeish; there is n't a girl around here, little or big, who would wear them. So, Miss Ann, if you want the girls to visit you, you must leave off such miserable finery, and do as they do," : "How is that?"Annie asked, in so subdued a tone that the zealous neighbor was encouraged to admin- ister more wholesome advice. "Why, take off your hoops, and wear your old bonnet and old frocks, as all of us: have sworn -to do; yes, (more vehemently) sworn to deny ourselves everything of the kind, all -from principle, you see, until this war is over; just to match Northern shop- keepers, for sending their clerks down here to steal our niggers. Theyll learn, too late, whose money they've been living on I But we've shut our purses now, and never, never will buy or use another article of Yankee make; norwould you, Miss Ann, if you had the right kind of principle about you."

"  That is my idea, exactly."      i "Now, one word about fashions," said the mis- chievous girl, demurely; " you tell your daughters that they can wear their hoops, and the very nicest things they can find in our stores; for the styles have changed so much since our merchants went North, no one here can be accused of imitating Northern fash- ions, let them dress as they will." ' You are sure of that, are you? for my girls would die, before they would wear the first thing like them miserable Yankees." I "Yes, quite sure; just to look at Godey's last fashion plates -           - "Eave you Godey's last?" and the neighbor's chair approached the settee where Annie sat, moder- ately fast. ," How Hshould like to take one, just one little look into it; Clara and Sallie are dying for Godey, but there I they wouldn't touch it, nor Harper and  Frank.

"Steal, child,.steal!" said the slightly disconcerted neighbor, clearing her mouth, in a manner more decorously imagined than described, for a fresh dip, ( I feel we have thrown away a great deal of money upon Northern trash, Northern humbuggery, and it is my due to make it up when I can.

"No indeed I there isn't a dopen, no, not half that number, who would go if you were to be there. Your brother Frank's not volunteering has set people to, talking awfully about you all; if Frank knew what was good for himself, he would fall into the ranks before he is a day older." - ( Brother Frank is not a man to be intimidated into doing anything," was the emphatic reply; then, after a short pause, - ,but do tell me, what the girls will wear to-morrow night?"- 1 "Oh, dear! that's what troubles the whole of us -'(and still more despondimgly) their pink silks are badly faded anl their muslins wretchedly torn. They are worried to death nearly, for fear they shall not look as well as the rest."' , How cheap silks were sellig, when I bought mine," said Annie, absently; " the nicest kind for a dollar a yard; fortunately I laid in a supply of thread, needles, pins, shoes, And frock! of various kinds. Why, they told me at the store, yesterday, that in less than a month not a thing of the kind could be had in the market." "Yes, indeed, that's -so. Not a pin, nor a spool of thread can be had here, to-day, nor this side of Newhern.   I sent Diek there, this morning, and if there are none to be ha'd in that city, the girls will have to stay at Lome from the ball, and it will ell- nigh kill them to do that."

"Yes, we all saw yours 'last Sunday.  It sets your dress out awfully about the bottom; but if that s the--fashion, no matter ;" up came the chair and the capped head dropped again to the girl's blooming face; "Look here, Miss Ann, rather than have the girls stay at home and lose such a ball, --a real soldier's ball, -the first one we have ever had here, you know, maybe, if Dick brings no pins nor thread I'l slip round or send one of the niggers and borrow a  hoop for each of the' girls; they needn't know but Dick brought them from Newhern." Again Annie's face assumed a very grave expres- sion as' he said, "No, Mrs. Prue, they will never know anything about it, for it would be unprincipled in- me to lend my hoops, or anything else which has been condemned, or to help cheat anybody." A   small cough, another dip, and Mrs. Prue arose to go, saying, ---, Of course, of course, you can do, as you please. If the girls, oe  ,   have any,- thing which you would like to borrow, don't hesitate to send round; I like to be on good terms with all my neighbors; and tell your mother, she added, draw- ing on her fly-bonnet, " she must come round and see us; and you must come too, Miss Ann, when you can feel and act as every Southern Christian should." +         , .    .       .,   EYiE-WITNESS.  -     143- She turned to leave, when, stopping suddenly as a young clady rode up, to the gate, she exclaimed, "If there isn't Puss Smith!  I should n't think she would come here!" (Dear Annie, I have just got home myself, or I should have been here before," were the words Mrs. Prue heard, as, with her bosom rife with enmity and ranikling jealousy, she turned from the gate to tread the sandy road homeward. A twofold object had this neighbor in view, when she announced to her astonished family circle her intention to call upon the McGowans: the first, and most essential, she thought'to accomplish by goino through the garden, thinking to hear something "I on the sly," which she could hurl into the unquiet stream of conflicting rumors, whose black waves of error and exaggeration were so soon to engulf that cheerful and devoted home: the other, to obtain a piece of Yankee finery, and, with such adventitious aid, to "fine" her girls for the ball; and in both endeavors, we have seen, she met with signal failure. As Mrs. Prue passes from  sight; feeling as uncomfortable, inly, as the evil-disposed can feel, when the heart, expanding to embrace some cherished project, is made to contract sharply under the stab of mortifying defeat, - our best wishes that she may reach a hap- pier goal than the one she is now heading for, attend her. "4Why, Annie, the sun has set," said her com- panion, jumping up. "Who would have thought I had been here two hours and more - But there, I. cannot leave until I know what you will wear at the ball to-morrow hight." "I have had no invitation to attend the ball," and ,  .     o   &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC8265-00000074"/> "4       EYE-WITNESS.  'Annie repeated Mrs. Prue's remarks, adding, (, I do not care to go; I have said I would not wear those secesh badges, and I will not!" "Annie McGowan, now hear me,  I am head manager of this ball- your name I have seen upon the list of guests, and your brother's also, although great opposition was offered to his being invited. Why your invitation has not been sent, is something for me to find out. Did Mrs. Prues 'girls,' as she calls them, dare to erase your names during my ab- sence? I think not, but I will investigate this mat- ter thorouoghly-, and see to whom this bneglect is chargeable. The girls around here, from what I' hear,are envious of you, solely because you have more stylish clothes than they, and look so beauti- fully in them, too." "It is better for me not to meet with them, then, if, as you say, my presence excites envy." '"No such thing, Annie dear. Now promise me you will go to-morrow night, and wear the most stylish clothes you have; then I must be off." : "I cannot promise, for papa and Frank are both away, and Iwould not like to leave mamma alone." "Only say you will go," pleaded the young lady, "and: I will find your mother a companion. You know  we have a nice chatty aunt living with us; now she will be eighted to spend an evening here, to ventilate some of her odd notions about this war; say you will go, and brother and I will call for you in the carriage." Annie finally gave her cqnsent to the arrangement, and then followed a long discussion upon dress and baI-adornings.

"Well, if you distrust what I say, come and see for yourself." Then, with her face flushed with mor- tification, and her heart fired with bitter animosity towards the supposed author of her riches in rags, the excited girl stamped her foot upon the floor, ex- claiming - "Abe Lincoln shall yet pay for all these annoy- ances, all this scrimping and pulling to keep one's self decently clothed! You must know, Annie, we are to march from Washington on to New York, and from there, who can tell where? What folly it is for our people to say, we have no use for the North; now I would just like to know who cares a fig for a bonnet, or a garment of any -kind, unless it comes from New York? It's the Yankees, themselves, we can do without, but not their splendid cities; to think of our owning Washington, New York, Saratoga, and Newport!

"- What news have you, Miss Mary?" asked Mrs. McGowan, stepping out on the veranda and seating 13  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC8265-00000075"/> "6       EYE-WITNESS. herself beside the young girls. "Do to-day's tele- grams bring what is favorable to our arms?  "( O, Mrs. McGowan, I have heard no particular news; I have only been fitting a key to the lock our soldiers are to turn." "And what is the treasure so ponderous a lock withholds?" "Liberty." (What do you mean by that, Mary?" "To do just what one wants to do, and in a way it suits one best; -tiat's what I call liberty; and 'tis what we have known as little about, under Yankee rule, as those nigs yonder." "( How are we to get such unconditional power, if you mean by us, the South?" "Why, by whipping the North, ,as we are going to do at Manassas." ("Our soldiers are confident of victory, I know; but we must remember that those who stand arrayed against us, are powerful." "As to numbers, yes; but when we have God on our side, what good will men and money do/them?" ,' Are we sure we have the God of battles on our side?"  "Certainly, .for God always favors the right; and I am equally sure, that that rich Astor's money might as well be thrown into the sea, as to be handed over to Abe Lincoln. Just to think of one man giving a hundred million to prosecute this war, and promising to lend as many more! Uncle James says, those merchant princes of New York are made of gold; and we all know, now, that what has been said' of their being so grasping-and mercenary as to sell their own children for a sixpence, is too true."   EYE-WITNESS.        147 Mrs. McGowan cast an anxious, warning glance upon her daughter; she saw that her cheek was flushed, and it was with difficulty she could restrain her emotions. She waited until her passion had subsided, and then said:- 4 I have heard you speak often of Mr. Astor's wealth, Annie. Can't you set your young friend rigoht as regards a true estimate of his property? I saw the statement of his enormous wealth in our paper; but I am sure, although a very rich man, Mr. Astor .has not so many millions to give Mr. Lincoln, or any one else." But the young lady was not to be convinced. "She should believe the papers, the Southern papers, before any assertion Northerners might make." Annie yielded the point with a good-natured laugh, and her friend coming off conqueror, continued her storm of invective against the North, until words were exhausted, if her passion was not, and finished by extolling the efficiency of Southern troops and their ability to annihilate any force which might be sent down upon them, from North, East, and West. "My dear young friend," said Mrs. McGowan, "you must not be too sanguine; the wail of defeat may yet sound throughout- our young Confederacy. The North and South are one people; the valor, fidelity, and endurance shown by-one faction may be equally matched by the other,. We must be pre- pared for any event which may happen; remember great deeds are not always the sons of mighty resolu- tions." "1How little your mother knows about the Yan- kees," said Puss Smith, as Mrs. McGowan's foot- steps were lost in the distance. ,' Defeat, indeed I r     , W.  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC8265-00000076"/> -148       EYE-WITNESS. there s-not a Southern soldier but would die twice, before, he would run from, or suffer himself to be taken prisoner lbya Yankee I What can a set of Yankee mechanics do, when face to face with our men, strong and brave as lions I Why, of course, they will run,-run with lightning speed too, to their coal-hods, mallets, and spades, where they came from.

' "They- can be starved to it."  "Puss," said Annie lowering her voice, , do you want to see arms in our negroes hands?

I wish :the North had them,- every soul of them," said Puss, musingly, and then with more energy, -   I have heard papa say, time and again, he wished slavery could be done away with, that niggers wvere a torment, eating and destroying in one year more than they are worth; and, for my part, I amheartily sick of them, they are so 'mean."

"I, a waiting-maid, compelled to handle a broom, to hook my frock, and lace my boots, - never " said Puss, emphatically. "Why not? We     may all have to, come to that.

Not an hour after sunset is it safe to be out without proper escort, the niggers are so saucy. Oh, dear'! when will this state of things end?" she added, somewhat despondingly, as the two drew near the gate; and, before she mounted her horse, she bent down to whisper; "If you should, hear unpleasant things said about your brother, to-morrow night, be too sensible to mind them. If he is as rank an abolitionist as Aunt Fannie " "sFrank is not an abolitionist," said Annie, indig- nantly interrupting her. (c He is called so because he will not volunteer, and is accused of keeping others from doing so . I do hope he will not fall into his Uncle Calvin's power." "( Brother knows how to take care of himself,"' 'was the rejoinder, and the young friends parted. *   CHAPTER XX. IGNORANCE AND HATRED. "MAMMA," said Annie, as mother and daughter sat together in the aeepening twilight,' what a com- fort it is to be alone; we have scarcely had an hour to ourselves since my return. Curiosity, we know, brings the greater part of our visitors to the house, and I must say- I have no patience with them for not a third part of the people about here read a newspaper, but credit every idle story which is afloat." "Annie, there would be no merit in cultivating patience in our hearts, if there was nothing to bear; nor to bear cheerfully, if there was nothing to en- dure; trials make our faith perfect." "I But, mamma, how can one as hot-tempered as myself have patience with people, who, like dogs, swallow the bone the master flings at them, whether it is poison or not? I told Mr. Wilson, who rode up soon after Puss Smith left, of my conversatioon with one of our neighbors on our flag. He laughed heartily and said, the men in the gross were no better informed; he had himself, within a month, proposed as a toast the ' Red, white, and blue,' to a crowd who had been railing at and cursing the 'supporters of that very flag, and it was drunk with prolonged  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8265-00000078"/> 152        EYE-WITNESS. cheers.* I do not wonder at such ignorance in- an old lady like Mrs. Prue, who has no thought, no as- piration aside from what money can bring; but for men to be so grossly ignorant as to curse-and cheer the same flag in the same breath, is almost incredible. No marvel that Calvin Hicks and his party, under I false pretences, swell their ranks with thousands of such dupes. I hope to see the day their eyes are opened, and they are fully conscious of the game Jeff. Davis and his tools make of them." "Be careful, Annie, that you do not repeat any of Mr. Wrilson's remarks out of the house; he says here what he would not say elsewhere.    He is a marked man, and, like your father and 'brother, ac- cused of being a traitor, for declaring this war unne- cessary." Still later in the evening Annie drew to her moth- er's side, begging to know why her Uncle Calvin had, for years, shown such ill-will towards their family. ," What put that thought into your head to- night?" asked Mrs. McGowan, somewhat startled. ("Something which Puss Smith said on leaving, has filled my' mind with Col. Hicks, (I like-best to call him  so, mamma,) and I have been wondering what any one of us could have done or said, to have made him such an enemy." "It is a sad, sad-story, my daughter, and a trial to. me to fill your young heart with the sinfulness of an uncle, and  that uncle my only brother. But," she resumed with a sigh, "it is, perhaps, well that * This may, appear almost incredible to Northerners, but is. none the less a fact, for I had-it from the gentleman himself, be- side others of a similar nature.

Calvin, when a boy, was headstrong and passionate, and the cause of great anguish to our parents. I was the only one who exercised any control over him, and never entirely lost my influence, until his shameful, profligate life made me close my doors upon him, and discard his image wholly from my heart. His wife died here, you remember. When she fled from the persecutions of the slave, who had usurped the au- thority, privilege, and affection of the wife,- I:'took her home. But her days were few; we soon laid her side -by side with the beautiful babes God had given, but in his mercy removed,.before the sin of their father had tainted their young lives. Twice Calvin and your father were rival candidates for the same office; your father's success, and my meddling with his domestic affairs, as he called it, is the cause- of the relentless animosity he has shown towards us all. He leaves, however, with his regiment the day after to-morrow; then, I hope, your father and brother will be spared the contumely which, as -non-combat- ants, he has /neglected no opportunity to heap upon  them." "I will not go to the ball, mamma, for I am sure I shall meet him there." "No indeed, Annie, he has no taste for such gay- eties. It is my wish that you should go; if you are the good-natured girl there you are at home, I am sure your companions will forget the prejudice they have conceived against you. If annoyed by their re- marks, remember the efficacy of a soft answer," she '"  '        ',:  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC8265-00000079"/> 154       EYE-WITNESS' added, smoothing the brown head which had dis- -placed the work in her lap. "I will go, if you wish it; and if Frank prevails - upon Maggie Blout to return with him, they may be here iqnseason to attend with me." An hour later, and a carriage was heard upon the drive. "Heretheyare, now!"cried Annie, spring- ing to the door, to welcome the travellers. "Massa Frank, didn't come," shouted John, and the carriage turned from thlldrive to the stable. J  -   CHAPTER XXT. THE REVEL ----HOW IT ENDED. 'Beautiful being in robes of white, ' The prettiest nightgowns under the sun; Stockingless, slipperless, sit in the night, For the revel is done." "WILL they live to come back?" and the weary head of the speaker drooped sadly upon the mantle. "Why, Carrie, of course they will.

Carrie, if you are so timorous a woman, as to scream at shadows, you are no fit mate for the Captain.  By the way, how well he looked to,-night; and Ned, too; the majors seemed to have jumped from a nice little lover to a deity to be-worshipped." "Cousin Ned certainly never looked better; and you have rewarded him at length for his persistent devotion, Sallie?" "Why, yes, I suppose so," and the heightened color and sparkling eye which the confession kindled, chased away the weariness which was before apparent in the heavy eyelid and sinking voice. "Now that Ned is really going away," she resumed,  I feel. I  .- 4,       '   &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC8265-00000080"/> 156       EYE-WITNESS. shall miss him wretchedly. I have promised him, that I 4vill keep all my songs and smiles until his returni, and he has promised me, ' what? Carrie, I would try your powers for divining the occult." "To come back to claim the conslummation of vows plighted." "More than that: try again." "Never to run from or allow himself to be taken prisoner by a Yankee." "Carrie " burst in the indignant girl, ,' you in- sult your cousin Run from a Yankee I Allow himself to be taken prisoner!" and a scornful laugh followed the mocking words. "Think you he or any other man -would show, himself in my presence that ever stepped a foot from the path of Yankee scavengers! Over 'them, is the road to Wash-- ington!" Without waiting for further conjecture on the part of her companion, and with the angry flush still on her cheek, she continued, -"He has promised to come as an Indian warrior, with his wampum-belt decked with Yankee bones, to lay his trophiesaat my feet, -or he comes not at all, - and he is to me as *though he were not." "/Monstrous! exclaimed Carie, while a very perceptible shudder shook her lightly-draped figure, "-I hate the Yankees as much as you, Sallie, but I hate barbarity more." "My dear, little fluttering friend, you will be the first to borrow my Yankee toys!" - Never, Sallie Pmrue!

And O, Sallie," she pleaded, "Edward loves you devotedly, passionately, and do you require of him a sacrifice of honor, manliness, and humanity, in order that a cruel whim may be gratified? Dare you wrest from the heart, which you have made weak as a child's, the noble attributes God has placed there, and send him out to the- battle-field with the scalping-knife in his hand, and the ferocious passions of the savage within his breast?" "You are a goosey, Carrie, to run on so about savrages and scalping-knives. Everything is fair in war; and if worse than savages come out against us, tomahawk must mseet tomahawk, knife meet knife." "Sallie, how can you talk so wickedly?" "There, Carrie, dry your tears, and I will talk of something else, lest you dream of death-heads, ,and prate of my depraved taste to your soldierly lord that is to be. He, by the way, is as much like you, as two tears on pity's cheek. I am sure you would both nurse a sick Yankee, as tenderly as you would one of our own soldiers. As for the Captain, - we al know he is a splendid shot, - should he bring down a dozen of these Yankees, he would as quickly throw away his gun, rush to his game, bind up wounds, wash faces, and set the blockheads again on their feet; then, with a polite bow and encouraging smile, turn back to the ranks." "Captain Lee is a gentleman and a soldier-- he knows his dutyi and will do it honorably," Carrie replied. "Come now, and lie down, Sallie, we have talked long, and I am very weary. "Not yet.

Not she, indeed i she talks about our abolition neighbors as unsparingly as myself." "But she was the only one, to-night, who showed herself friendly to Annie McGowan." - "Were you in her set, when- her Uncle Calvin ac-" costed her so ungraciously?" "Hwas directly opposite her, and was, at the very moment, admiring her bright and beautiful face, and theperfect simplicity of her dress, which so charm- ingly set off her youthful figure and graceful move- ments."      - "Tell me just what she said, and how she looked, when she answered Col. Hicks." "I saw this dark, fierce-looking Colonel when he came into the hall, and I was told. afterward, that as soon as his eye rested on his niece; he stopped in his walk, and watched her through the figure. He then walked directly up to our set, and touched her upon the shoulder.. Miss Annie had been laughing with her partner, Lieut. Smith; but when she turned and saw the man who confronted her, her cheek lost its beautiful color, and her girlish face at once became , white and firm. When he -said, ' Col.

Oh! what a fierce look. he fixed on her sweet face, as she read those few words. Raising her eyes to those bent upon her, she said, ' This is your work.' "It is my work to seize traitors, wherever I find them," he replied, sneeringly. "Col. Hicks," she said firmly, "if you have any- thing more to say to me, select a more suitable place. You impede the dance." Then turning to her part- ner, she spoke in a low voice, and the two left the hall. With a smile which made me loathe the man, he watched her from sight; then turned on his heel, and joined a group on the, rostrum. In a few moments, the news that Frank McGowan was in prison at Salisbury, spread through the hall, and what rejoicings followed! I was glad- Miss McGowan had left. - It was this Miss Smith, or Puss Smith, as you call her, and her brother, who es- corted her to the carriage. I afterward heard Miss Puss sharply contradict many things that were said of the McGowans, and openly declare Calvin Hicks was the fabricator of every vile story which was cir- culated about the family."  \ , Well, for my part, Carrie, I am not sorry Frank McGowan is in prison; he is no coward, I know, but those who will not come out and openly espouse , our cause, must be against us, and the sooner such people are out of harm's way, the better. I am sorry that Annie should have heard such unpleasant news in the ball-room. But there, that is throwing sympathy away.

ONCE more the streets were thronged with volun- teers, and -wealth was lavishly poured into a depleted treasury; while earnest women plied the needle and robbed homes of needful comforts for those whose work was not yet done. Places of fashionable resort were for the most part abandoned;, and sea-breezes and all, the allurements of the visiting season forgotten; for a stern- and inex-  orable duty was upon men and women. The sick could not work, so waters of healing must be resorted to; and officers firom the Gulf -States also sought for their families a home, where a short furlough from the field of action could be enlivened by the presence of heart-idols. The " Home," * situated amid the hills of Western 'North Carolina, celebrated alike for the medicinal properties of its Springs, and the beauty of its scenery, and as its site commanded direct communi- cation with Richmond, which was but twelve hours ride, was doomed to a most uncomfortable notoriety.

And gentlemen were not a few; judges, lawyers, and planters, too old for active service, having given their sons and -wealth for liberty, sat down in the pleasant "Home," to greet the coming of the day, whose dawn was kindling the Southern sky. Bach- elors gay, and those too crabbed and crotchety, whose want of a wife was, for the first time, keenly-felt, (should master and overseer be called into the field without a head, those , held to labor " might enact a scene, detrimental, at least, to the master's interest,) gathered there.

IT was night, but no sound of revelry came from the brilliantly lighted ball-room. A holy hush per-+ vaded the entire house, while grief and weariness were legible on the faces of old and young; who, seated in groups, talked of the solemnity of a sol- dier's burial that day witnessed. An officer, on his way to the ball, given at the "Home" on the previous night, had been thrown from his horseSand killed instantly. A favorite with -his men, and no less popular with the ladies, his death was deeply deplored in camp and parlor. t Re- port said, his father was a Union man, and disowned his son when he took up arms against the Federal Government. Be that as it may, the deceased had exacted the promise from a brother officer, that, if he should survive him, his body should be buried where he fell, and his sword, his only love, laid by his side. "To think," exclaimed a young lady to her brother, who had just arrived, then on his' way to Virginia to join his regiment, '" of any man being so inhuman as to deny this young soldier a grave ;- giving an excuse, that niggers coulda-not be mhade to work on land where dead men lay.

".)id you ladies follow in the procession that dis- tance, in such a broiling heat as we have experienced to-day?"  "Certainly," chorused the group, to .whom the question was addressed.

You' must know,"--with true in- valid look and voice she continued, -"that I have beenin the habit of going to Saratoga yearly, and, in my present infirm state of health, Congress water is indispensable. It is, however, quite out of the question for me to think of going to Saratoga, New- port, or any other place North, until we have posses- sion of two or three of the Yankee States at least. Now, what I want to know of you, is, how soon we may claim, say, Pennsylvania and New York, as our own?                     " "Never! madam," was the emphatic reply.

We may look for wholesale falsehood among Yankee people, where lying is an indigenous talent, but-" -- "M'adam," said the Captain, interrupting, , the Post, which Judge Green read from, is a sensation paper, and no sensible person would waste -a thought on the matter contained in it.' "-What paper then contains reliable news'?" very despondingly was -asked. "The Richmond Examiner is, in my estimation, the only paper worth the reading." "- O dear! '0O dear 1 If what you say-be true, and our papers are up to lying, we can't expect to be prospered.  But do tell me, Captain, if the North does not offer to make peace, what we may expect next?" "A  fight, more sanguinary even than the last."  Then I hope Beauregard will be allowed to push on North, as he wished to do after the Bull Run af- fair. I am convinced, that if Joe Johnson had been out of the way, and Beauregard had beeh allowed to carry out his plans, I should now -be sipping my Con- gress water with the dignified grace of one, wh6o is monarch of all she surveys."       - 1"That was the -first and last chance that Dixie had for Northern conquest," was the rejoinder.

"But, Captain, if, with all the fight, which is in our soldiers, we can't hold our own and gain what is, absolutely essential to our comfort, let a draft be re- sorted to." " One thing we must have, and that is New York city, before Christmas, draft or no draft," said a merry voice at the Captain's elbow-. ,( You .here, Miss Mary? he said, turning; (, I thought the dance possessed irresistible Icharms-for you.

"And you class me among that weakly sort of people?       , "Yes, Miss Mary, and worse," said the blunt Captain. , I call all men and women cowards, who say the Yankee is yet to be born, who- can turn them one foot from his track; and I regret to add, not a , lady of my acquaintance here, but has avowed the same. As for- the men, they have perjured them- selves fearfully, if back to the foe' is written against them." "And do you advocate Yankee skedaddling?" "I recommend discretion in all things. 'Were I overpowered, and saw a chance to save my life by taking to my heels, I am quite sure I should make the attempt; and I am  almost as sure, should the Yankees approach your city and threaten to shell it, not one of you ladies but would seek an asylum in our Western hills." "!I, never! I would brave - danger and death even in defence of my beautiful home; were we in Baltimore, I could convince you my courage is not of words." "Washington may have its turn as well as Balti- more."         /: A merry laugh followed the Captain's suggestion. "Why not, Miss Mary?" '  "For the very stubborn fact, that it will' keep the Yankees sleepless, to defend :their own Washington; our troops are now at its very gates!" "We must not forget the North has a navy.

Now, if we are mad enough to burn what, at present, alone consti- " tutes our wealth, to prevent its falling into Yankee hands, and refuse to plant more, we throw away the only key which unlocks us to the world." A commotion was' at this moment heard in the outer hall; and a brother officer, with marked agita- tion approaching, whispered to the Captain, and^the two hurriedly left the room. * .   &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC8265-00000095"/> CHAPTER XXVI.

COME with me, reader, among other- actors on the world's wide stage, upon whom the 28th of August rose cloudless. Before the finger upon the dial of time marked the day far spent, wondering eyes were turned to the heavens. Quick, sharp thunder-claps- heralded a storm, but still no cloud obscured the blue expanse above; clap succeeded clap, yet- no storm- cloud, no flash. , Somebody is getting it," says the merchant, as he complacently rubs his hands. "The storm will not trouble us," and he turns from the lookout to the cool counting-room.     '     ' "'There's a storm brewing," growls the sportsman, and he shoulders his gun and whistles to his hounds. "Mighty big thunder," chuckles Sambo, in the corn-field; and he too scans the heavens for the rain- cloud which will send niggers to cover. But before night a sound was heard, which shook homes and terror-smitten hearts, as if an earthquake spoke. That sound- " The Yankees are on us! Yankee gunboats 0boom along our shores!" Maggie Blout, a prisoner in her own house, with a heart tortured by the uncertainty of the fate of one she had risked her life to save (who had been be- ,f        .   &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC8265-00000097"/> 190       EYE-WITINESS, trayed into the-hnter's power), and by the absence of her Cousin Hlry, whom the world called dead, - a-word had reached her that he was well, and would soon strike home for her, -endured the days of her captivity with that self-sustaining energy which defies calamities, beneath the weight of which weaker minds would sink. Frigidly affable, Ralph Bierce met his captive daily at the board; there he carelessly recounted the events of the hour; for all intercourse with the world with- out, and all, newspapers, had been 'interdicted from the moment Ralph's hand had fallen upon her trust. -'"Those are Yankee guns, Cousin Margaret," he s aid, as he sought her -side that August morning. "Iwill thread your needle; those, trembling hands can never do it." As Maggie quietly declined his assistance, he added- "1-Why so moved? you have nothing to fear." "Fear!I Ralph, conscience only makes cow- ards ,- (   You are very white, and I see your breath comes hurriedly; nay, do not struggle to conceal your emo- tion, for I can assure you the Yankees can neither harm me nor aid you.", , Your welfaree does not particularly: interest me, nor am I so selfish as to think of myself, when brave men are falling like autumn leaves, perhaps at each blast of those distant guns." "Were you to- die to-morrow, and a violent death might bea averted by those same Yankees pegging away at our forts, this booming of cannon-  R^alph, speak out; what do you insinuate?" -"W hat, by your looks,I know you divine. Why torture me so?"   EYE-WITNESS.        191 "Would, it ease your heart to know, that to-mor-  row Richard Wheddon dies?" ("If he must die," and Maggie spoke slowly and firmly, "better it should be so, than to drag out a miserable existence in a loathsome cell." " Such resignation is truly sublime! . I thought it woman's nature to weep, when robbed of heart's idols;, but you, Margaret, do sit here unmoved, as the rope swings, which is to launch a sin-smitten soul into eternity. What a commentary upon the faith- lessness of womanls love!"              - "That I do, Ralph, and smile ;oo, but not at thei approaching death- of a man, the daily beauty of whose life makes yours hateful"; I smile at the mean malignity thdt his unswerving fidelity to his country has aroused; for I know, and you know also, that, deadly as your enmity is towards him, rot one-hair of the head God has set his seal upon, can you or your minions harm." "Tell me, Margaret, where the waters of purifica- tion are to be found, where befoul traitors and ef-  fetes intriguantes go down, and come up saints and singing angels? I would dip, and be couttted worthy to be numbered with such shining lights," Ralph said in his usual sarcastic tone. "Your sainted mother taught me where the true waters of comfort are to be found." "Hold! my mother's name is sacred; speak it not!" and the proud man bowed his head as 'if smit-' ten by an unseen hand; then, rising, paced the room hurriedly.              * Maggie gathered up her -work-, and rose ito leave; her cousin's presence. As she, laid her hand upon} the door-knob, Ralph wasi by her side. "S Stay) and hear what I would say, "he said.  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC8265-00000098"/> 192       EYE-WITNESS. Refusing the chair he motioned tfor her to take, yet grasping his extended hand, Maggie said:-- -"Ralph; for your mother's sake, I wish we were friends. "   "(You speak of my mother. Had she lived; I should not be the man I am, wrecked and ruined by the woman who bears my father's name. Though so young when she died, I loved her with all the fervor of my nature; had she lived, a life's homage would have been too little for the wealth of affection she lavished on me. 'But she died, and I live to curse heaven-"  ( Stop, Ralph; curse ethe abode where your an- gelic mother calls you! Learn to love what she loved, and there is an eternity for you to spend together.'" "Go! Margaret," and, as he spoke, he dropped her hand; -" your woman's tongue unmans me."w She glanced up to the dark face, which was par- tially turned from her. Grief and contrition were plainly stamped there; and the sight of a tear on his swarthy cheek made her heart bound with inexpress- ible joy. "Cousin Ralph may be saved yet," she thought. "Love of thee, dear Aunt Mary, is the only ' green blade of joy' in that blasted heart. May thy angelic presence guide-the stumbling steps of thy first-born, best4oved child!" Through the long evening Maggie sat at her win- dow, and, although peals of distant thunder sounded at intervals, she paid no heed; for the execution of the morrow weighed heavily upon her spirits. "O Harry, Harry, why are you not here?" she breathed aloud; " no kindly sympathy, no loving word; dear, dear Harry come back!" A  step upon the walk aroused her. She raised   EYE-WITNESS.  X     193 her head, for her heart whispered, " he has come!" But no, " only Dr. Pill," she sighed. As she leaned from the window, she noted that the man, who was not an infrequent visitor of Ralph, was listening in- tently, and counting on his fingers the sharp claps which sounded now at shorter intervals. Ralph^s words, "Yankee 'guns," came to her, but she, shut her heart, and would not indulge the wild throb of delight, which his words at first excited. Pushing wide the blinds,':-"I will watch the storm," she thought. "God's voice is in the whirlwind; it may speak peace to my- Great God! and can it be?" burst from her, as her eye swept that quarter-of the heavens resonant with thunder-claps where not a cloud, not a miniature float obscured the dazzling brightness of the glowing concave. "God be praised! t the Yankees are here, on our very coast," and she clapped her hands in ecstasy of joy, as a continuous roar shook the air, and died, and rose gnew. "Amen to that, lady I " Maggie dropped her eyes, and they rested upon Dr. Pill. Stout, but misshapen, dressed in coarse garments he stood; uncovered as to his head, for his one hand held the felt hat, which a true feeling of chivalry had raised, although he boasted no " descent from English cavaliers." - Quickly she drew back. "There is something about that man which ]strangely affects me," she mur-- mured; " what can he have to do with Ralph?- : He- must indeed be an arch-dissembler, if a Union: man, to dupe my shrewd cousin. I remember now,;it was after one of his gcalls here, I found that :word from Harry, pencilled on papa's bust; he may have news  for me to-day. There, that was what I read in his 17 i .l     &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC8265-00000099"/> -\\ 194       EYE-WITxLESS. face:; .and he shall bear tidings of MrWhedden's im- minent danger to Harry." The few words were written with a trembling hand, and once more, with unwonted cheerfulness, Maggie 'had seated herself at the window to await the doctor's reappearance, when a summons came to meet Ralph in the parlor. (i" ar3aret,' he said, on meeting her there, ,news has just come whTcl calls me to the city. Dr. Pill confiirms what I told you this morning. The Yan- kees are upon our coast, ten to one of the force, which man our torts. Men have been sent for; I leave with the cop any which goes from our city." Then,* droppg 'hisice, he continued , TYour reputation, your l'fe is in my hands; one word of mine, and the prisoners doonm is yours. The negrd who betrayed you is dead; those you have here are devoted to you. I go away, Miraret,' but put not' out your hand again to rescue-these accursed Yankee sympathizers. This time I spare you, for I would hurt no thing my mother smiled upon;.but now I warn you, as there is power inm law, your life is forfeited, if you raise but a finger again to aid proscribed heads. The woman 1bsoughtohere'has slipped through my fingers. I have ::to thank you for that. I have track of her; you look as if you doubted it, but it is true. No -woman outwits me but once; remember that, and remember, also, what awaits you if you set aside my threat.,   . Y ithout waiting for a reply, Ralph turned away, and, with Dr. Pill,left the house. Hardly had the dooir closed upon them, when the loved bust was raiseda. There lay a slip of paper, and Maggie read thereon: ;-   '    ,  '        .     .

"Run, missis, run I old Butler'll. catch you," cried  her maid, bustling into the room. "No, Kizzie, never!

' Missis is a powerful shot, I knows, and a mighty sight braver than. them white folks runnin' yonder. See,-see, they come this way!"  Mistress and maid leaned ftrm thie window, and a scornful smile played over the watcher's face, as she marked the crowd of young men and maidens, old men and children, who, panic-smitten, rushed pell- mell through the streets to the depot.

With a blow, the low door flew wide, and a strong man entered. ("Be you Richard Whedden, what was to be hung?" he cried. "That is my name." A low chuckle, a whispered word succeeded,: and the tall, gaunt man sprung to his feet, and followed his bandy-rlegged, one-armed guide to the door, where a cart- and mule were in waiting.: With- a powerful lift, the prisoner was safely placed in the cart, and the rude driver, leaping in after him, shouted, as he lashed his mule amid the press of -fug- itives  ("Split ahead, Dixie!- clear the track, niggers!- jump in write trash! Yankee gun-boats, slam up to the city!" then to his mule, "mind you, Sal, what did I feed you for?  Tear ahead, Dixie,--forty miles to Weltown!

At the sound of his voice, with instinctive quick- ness, Mrs. Fay had shut off the gas, but had uncon- sciously dropped the valise. Over it the intruder tripped, and fell heavily upon the floor; and, before he had regained his feet, the door was closed and locked behind the, retreating- figures of Maggie and her friend.

Maggie possessed a quick, comprehensive mind,- one which could easily and effectively call into play whatever resources the emergency of a case might find within reach; and now, when such fearful peril threatened her friends and herself, her powers of per- ception seemed doubly quickened, and the project conceived found her with ready means for its execu- tion. ,      - , Mrs. Fay," she said, " you must not delay your departure longer than is absolutely necessary.

As Maggie spoke, she raised her'weapon; a sharp report followed, and the bat fell dead upon the news- paper, which Ralph held carelessly. "By Jove I Margaret, practice will make you a killing shot." The report brought Pomp into the room. He was a powerful negro, and powerfully armed, and no friend of Ralph's; that, the latter well knew. He glanced from the savage Iook of the athletic slave, to the Iiistress; her face, where beauty, purity, and dig- nity were so happily blended, was white as marble, and her eyes flashed intense indignation and stern-re- solve. Ralph was unarmed; and, seeing that there was no way of escape, he said quietly, "Sit down, Mar- garet.

("Move one foot, nigger," burst in Ralph, but Maggie was too quick for him; she reached the door first. "Lock it!" she cried. 'The bolt slipped, and Pompwas safe without. , Stand back!"Ralph shouted, but Maggie stood defiant and resolute. He looked at her, doubly armed, roused, as he afterward said, to perfect despera- tion; at the heavy door, securely bolted; at the open window, where he had so unceremoniously dropped a man crippled by a fearful wound; then, as no other alternative offered, he quietly walked back po his chair, and resumed his reading. An hour passed, and still another, and no sound broke the silence of the room, save the ticking of the clock on the mantel, and the monotonous turning of the leaves of the book, which Ralph held. "Margaret," he said at length, "you have the spirit of a martyr," and, as he spoke, he turned and looked upon his captor. As no notice was taken of his remark, and he noted that her face had assumed a sternness, which showed that, in her nature, there. was a strength of purpose not easily overcome, he spoke again; this time his voice was more gentle, almost persuasive. &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC8265-00000106"/> ^^-       EPE-WrEES. ;' Yes, RalTph, you are in my poqwer f0 this night, at least.

Before the door was opened, he was before it, confronting his cousin, and heard her softly whispered -caution, which so painfully precipitated un!ooked-for events. "All is plain now, Lizzie.

She had told Jake that some one was under her mistress' -protection; but, as she had promised- had never even whispered naimes, although Jake was always at her to do so.

He had been to tA'zie, and thld her Jake was a no-accoitnt niggerj and he meant- to tell his mistress; and was only-deterred from- doing so by her saying, if he made one complaint about JaIe, she would burn his cabin down; buts after what -Pomp had said, she kept her eye on Jake, and held her tongue, which so provoked him that he swore he would get another wife, and run off North.

He tried to bribe Ann to tell him what it was; but she called him a fool, and told him to get out, -that he didn't know what, he was talking about. Jake told Ralph what he had heard, and, as his assistants were outr on a scout, he was sent to the city for aid. In attempting to overtake the cart which bore the man Ralph had dropped from a window to his men, Jake was over- taken by Pomp; he knew him, and swore he was at the bottom of the fuss, and should smart forit.

He knew he should not live long, and begged tosee his wife; but that was refused him. One day Lizzie heard the guard say, "' That's a mighty nice cabin where that nigger is, but he'll have no use for it many more days." She thought it must be Pomp who was dying, and set her heart on reaching him. She did so by treating the guard freely to whiskey, and found, not Pomp, but Jake, sick unto death. He told her what he had done, and wanted her to tell her mistress it was for money to get off North, which had made him so wicked. He wanted her to sing "I'm going home to'die no more."' While she . was singing, he fell asleep; and for fear of detection- she returned to the house. The next day, when Ralph returned from the city, she heard the guard say to him,-( The sick nigger is dead;" she saw him throw them money, and heard him say, , See to it he is decently buried!"   CHAPTER XXX. UNEXPECTED FRIEND. "I SAW the Yankee prisoners," said Helen ierce, while on a brief visit to her cousin Maggie, after a somewhat lengthy visit in Newhern. Those that were wrecked off Beaufort during the late gale, Nellie?" ,Yes; I saw them as they marched from the depot to the jail, and I must add, though a very mean-looking set of men, they walked manfully, yes, defiantly amid the crowd, which abused them roundly ; afterward, through the kindness of Dr. Pill, I visited the jail, or rather, saw all I wished to of them from without the door.'

"Have your Newhern friends quite recovered from the Butler panic" asked Maggie, wishing to avoid Xfurther conversation upon Mr. Whedden's escape. "Yes, quite so, and, as you may well believe, are e-xtremely sensitive upon that topic.

Through Dr. Hall's aid, who alone of my friends knew of-my return, I had se- cured means-for his escape from prison-%walls, when ' that, to us, glorious Butler panic dispensed with further intrigue, and numbered Dr. Pill and friend among the ghostly throng which westward pressed." W"Well do I remember that memorable morning " "And Miss Helen does, also, I reckon*' "Why, Helen?  She, I was told, was the only lady in town that did not leave in the panic." Then followed the particulars of the freak of his mule before her door, and his gaining the possession of his own horse, Nise, from her stable. Recover- ing her composure, which Harry's exploit had for a time completely overthrown, Maggie said:-: "/Now tell me of your patients, the prisoners; are they very great suffererss?" rt Sufferers!

"I, Harry?" "Yes.

"Yes; and God grant that the work they have to do here may be unflinchingly and thoroughly done 1! But what have you there, a letter?" "Yes, from  my dear young friend, Annie Mc- Gowan; it was handed to me as I passed through the hall." "Read it aloud, Maggie.  Her father is as true a Union man as we have in the State."

He had a warrant to arrest John McGowan, Robert Wilson, Frank Graves, and some six others.

I stood upon the door-step, and looked up to those gloomy walls, which shut from sight papa, and all those good men whose names the jailer had given me. Their wives and children-must watch and wait; theirhearts ache, as mamma's and mine, and must keep on ach- ing until the Yankees come. Frank's words came to me: (A woman armed is more formidable to meet than a man, when the sanctity of her home is in- vadd.'  ' Frank is right,' I thought; ' women, nowadays, must study somethinghbeside patience; they. must fight, and they can'do it to save their loved ones from cruel- deaths. Who,' I thought, -had brought down upon us such misery? Who had- sworn never to rest until Jane McGowan had drank to the dregs the bitter draught his malignity had concocted? You, Calvin Hicks!' I involun- tarily shouted. I had gone to the gate; so shaken was I by the hateful thoughts, which tortured me, I had not noticed the approach of a horseman. At the sound of my voice, he drew rein, then walked his horse by the fence on which I leaned. The newly- risen moon shone fully on his face, so hideous, so ,..

Now, when smarting from a- blow heavier than the first, my merciless foe appeared be- fore me. I knew I was in the shadow offthe house; that, if seen, I could not be recognized; I felt those hor- rid eyes glare upon me, and I seemed to hear the glad -chuckle hiss from his teeth, that another M'c- Gowan was in his grasp, and that victim my papa! The thought maddened me; I drew my pistol- from the folds of my shawl, raised it, and took deliberate aim. As my finger pressed the trigger, he leaned towards-me, and I heard, Is that you, Sal?"I heard no other sound; but I saw the tall man reel in his saddle, then strike the ground.  "I reached home. I spentthe long night in the garden; I woke my pets, and fed them: I pickedl flowers for the vases, and, with my apron full, walked up and down the shadowy paths until morning broke; then I went to the house, to my own little room, and prepared for breakfast.

I read it, but so calmly, she pressed me to her, saying:- ' "'My daughter does not distress me by her usual violent expressions; now read,' she added, 'this note, which has just been sent in.' ' I took the note; it was -from the friend, who had sent news of papa's arrest. Therein I read of the mortal wound Calvin Hicks had- received during the night,- supposed to have been inflicted by one of his negroes, who had once before attempted his mas- ter's life.               ; "I could not speak; I bowed my face in my hands, and knelt down by mamma's bedside. ' Annie,' she said, ' while we may rejoice that God has removed from our path 'so violent an enemy, we must pray that he may be awakened to a sense of his own wick- edness; that his last momentsmay .be spent in mak- ing his peace with his Creator.' I made no reply, but kissed -mamma, and left the room. I went to the jail; papa was at the window. He had read my note, --I saw it in his face. The jailer told me Col. 'Hicks hMad been shot down at his gate, not a half- hour after I left- his house. 4, Will he die?' I asked.  "' The chances are ten to one that he does; the -wound has been probed, but, they tell me, the ball cannot be extracted. Ah!

'Twas that man, Hicks, who kept the colinty in such a stir about them; and, I can tell you now, he swore he would have every one of them shot, or in Salisbury, before the week was out; and' he would have made his threat good, if the Lord .hadn't put him'out of the way.' To-morrow, he said, I should see papa; that, now Hicks was dispatched, there was not a man living he feared. , The day has passed. As I kissed mamma  cgood night,' I told her I was to watch with a sick person. She either did not, hear, or was too engrossed with 'her own thoughts to heed my remark; for she smiled when I spoke, but did not question me. She is sleep- ing now; so is Percy, and I lay down my diary to go to duty as nurse. "' Dec. 5. Last night I watched with the sick man; no one comes to Calvin Hicks's couch, no ione speaks of him but in terms of reproach,; eventhe : doctor looks in upon him as if he wished it might be his last call. What a dreadful misfortune to live hated of all men I but what a terrible thing to die without raising one prayer for forgivenessA! Through- out the night, I sat by his couch, and: bathed his head, and cooled his swollen lips; while my ears were filled with the groans which his agony wrung from him. I knelt down at his -side, and prayevd-that my sin might not be, visited upon those I loved, that one short hour of consciousness might be allowed the sinking man for repentance. For myself tI ould not pray; I'felt no contrition, no grief; I simply felt glad that Calvin Hicks, the guerilla chief, the wife- murderer, the fiendish captor of my father and broth-' er, was powerless to commit further crimes, and, in * .    -  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC8265-00000115"/> 226       EYE-WITNESS. his own body, suffering the torments he loved to in- flict upon others. No suspicion of the deed would rest upon me, but I knew God's eye saw my heart, and from Him I felt my sentence must come. I left the house when day broke. I left him alone, for his servants, after robbing their master of everything valuable, had taken to the swamps; but, while he lives, mamma and I will see that he does not suffer for nursing. "I go to the jail at ten o'clock. Oh! the joy, the delight, of being looked in papa's arms again! I shall tell him all." Here the diary closed.

SCENES IN NEWBERN. -- THE WINTER OF 1862. THE season which followed the Hlatteras alarm was the gayest ever recorded -of the city of ---. Mar- tial strains and martial -sights filled the streets, and the lofty consciousness of "' irresistible might," and duty unflinchingly met, the hearts'which beat en mili- taire, and the more tender ones under calico an4 homespun. What though the blockade banished rich viands and Eastern luxuries? The guest was no less welcome at the hospitable board, and regaled with delicious decoctions of parched rye and sweet potato, which, sipped from china and silver, was pronounced more than a fair substitute for Java and Mocha. What though the salad was crude and unsavory, the light laugh and bewitching grace with which it was tendered, made the otherwise unpalatable bitter, sweet- ness. What though the hand which rested upon the gay cavalier was gloveless, how proudly it was pressed! Is it a marvel that-the warm blush kin- dled, as upon the manly form at her side, the de- voted maiden recognizes the suit which her- own hand had woven, with its warp of gray cotton and woof of silk,-- the very silk which once adorned that petite figure, cut, ravelled, carded, and:woven by the hand which now, in happy confidence, is laid ! la   i  'IA.

"Formidable, invincible, indeed!" laughed the young Confederacy: (" what had Southern braves 'to fearfrom a set of snivelling pettifoggers, pedlers, cob- blers, and colliers, such as New England had turned out to equip Burnside's expedition, - the nine-days' wonder." A hearty laugh is contagious; and the mere sug- gestion of this ' far-famed expedition" called forth such commentaries upon New England Yankees, - which, in Secesh parlance, can be more becomingly imagined than repeated here, - that convulsive cach- ination was universal.

Not' the least. gay is Mr. Francis Bierce's holsehold; not the least happy, Maggie Blout's temporary home, which is daily enlivened by Dr. Pill's jovial presence.  A bright March morning sees Francis Bierce pac- ing his office with agitated -steps. His usual placidity of expression has vanished, and now heavy forebod- ing 'arkens his brow, and sets deep lines about his mouth. :A friend breaks in upon his revery, exclaim- ing, "That was a capital speech of yours, Bierce, last night. Your patriotism will cost you something, sure."  "Not a cent," said the one addressed, drawing up his chair to his friend's side; " don't think I'm such an ass as to go down with this d-d Confederacy. I've secured a plank which will survive the wreck, and I reckon you are with me there, Dunn."

Why was our garrison crippled at Roanoke, just as the Yankees were on us? Why our own brave boys called out of the State, and South Carolina's sneaking d--ls sent here for our defence? What does Jeff care if our State is overrun with Northern Vandals, if he, and his army in Virginia, can fatten on our bacon, and fight from behind the ramparts which our boys' guns afford?" ,We are getting it! We are getting it! No doubt about that, andit comes of our letting the iron  cool before we struck. Kentucky and Missouri brag their flags were flying, before -the buntming of ours was woven.

Again the door opened. "Bierce," said a bustling man entering, , couldn't leave the city without tell- ing you what a heap of good your speech, last night, did me. - agree with you heartily, that a man is as much a' traitor. to his country; as a Yankee abolition- ist, who refuses to put the brand to his cotton and turpentine. I'm off now to follow your example ; if I haveIn' as many cotton bales by a hundred, I'm a little ahead of you in turpentine, I reckon. Our- President, our cause, need just such men as you to keep us sharp to the mark. Publish' your speech, Bierce; publish it in aHl the papers, and the Yanks may, hunt the Confederacy through for a pound of cotton, or a gill of turpentine, to gloat over." On the evening of the same day, Miss Helen Bierces parlors were brilliantly lighted; for there, were assembled the grave, young and gay, who, with pleasing rivalry, vied with each other in the sprightly saUy, and patriotic song, to drown the :humiliatin consciousness of the enormity of the disaster which hai dbefallen their State. The presenc e of Gen. Runn and staff, added much to the eclat of the occasion. : General, said  elen, turning from the-piano, where her brilliant, execution of the , Manassas Rout,"  the most popular piece ofthe day,--had eiUcited ihe warmest encomiums; :, how many weeks   EYE-WITNESS.   -    233 have we to enjoy the undisturbed possession of this, our adopted city?" "My dear young lady," was the reply; "you, like many others, and, I may add, the press univer- sally, give the Yankees credit for a display of prow- ess they by no means deserve. Among the Yankee pioneers of the West, we may expect to find pluck and dogged obstinacy, naturally the result of the wild life they lead, which may give us some trouble to overcome; but Burnside's men are mostly New Eng- land Yankees, and, my word for it, not one in ten among them can handle a musket soldierly, if they can distinguish the breech from the muzzle." "But you must allow, General,"   said Helen, "that they gained a decided advantage over us at Roanoke." "Yes, some little advantage; all owing to their great superiority in numbers, however. Let them follow the 4 ignis fatuus' which has led them on thus far, and they will find Newhern a bog from which there is no escape." Respect, paid to the opinion of superior officers, silenced- further remark upon the subject of Yankee capacity. Glances, however, were exchanged amid the crowd of eager listeners, and more than one eye flashed -saucily, as if something might be said to the contrary, if to disagree with so wise a General was not unpardonably discourteous. "Then -we are free from all alarm here," Helen said, glancing mischievously upon the group around; "this leaving home in a panic is distressingly un- sightly, to say the least." "Laugh at us, Helen, if it so please you; -we all know your courage, and th fact, also, that it was ! i     2*  . --  s-'-  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC8265-00000119"/> ,234   --    YE-W'INrESS. only at the command of your father, you left. As for myself, I am not ashamed to own I was. among the foremost to run from home at the Butler scare, nor to avow that, at the present time, I feel quite in the mood for ruralizing, although the season for the country has not begun."' To a remark' of one of his staff, Gen. Runn re- plied: ' "Certainly, certainly, the possession of our inland seas is of some advantae toour enees but not, as many think, an irreparable loss to ourselves. NWith the force assigned me, I feel confident we shall sus- tain no further loss, and shall ultimately drive the invaders from the State."

Here comes the Captain Selden; he is hon- est and outspoken; we will hear his opinion of the invaders.  "What is it," asked that officer, drawing to the side of the young lady who beckoned his approach; and, to her question, replied:-  "Donelson and Roanoke afford fair proof of some ability, surely." "But that does not satisfy us, Captain.' Wewish to know, if man to man the North and South should meet, which do, you think would come off victorious?" ("Miss Jennil, I have never met our enemy in the field; until I have, I cannot give you a fair opinion." "Nor never will, so long as your company is sta- tioned here."         s "It is by no means unlikely that your city will be attacked."  "Burnside is too prudent .a general to lead his men upon such fortifications." i( It  may prove so; but say, ladies, to look the matter full in the face, are you prepared for any emergency which may arise in case Newhern is tt- tacked! "-You surely do not mean to insinuate there is fur- ther flight for us, Captain?" said the startled Jennil. All present, in fact, the entire State, knew that, from the first incursions of the Yankees under But- ler, by unremitting toil and at enormous expense, Newhern had been rendered, to use the popular word, "impregnable." "For," said the press, 'C if the fall of Hatteras, and, more recently, the surrender of Roanoke Island, should be followed by the loss of Newhern, a great  &#xD;<pb n="236" xml:id="VAC8265-00000120"/> 236       EYE-WITNESS.  portion of the State, embracing the most valuable lands, -wealth, and, at least, one third of the slave population, would then be in possession of the enemy." So, by every scheme which human ingenuity could devise, the channel of the Neuse was- blocked, that the approach to the city might not be made by gun- boats; and water batteries and field fortifications reared a threatening front for miles around. The idea, therefore, of Newhern's falling into' the hands of the foe, was simply absurd; and the Captain's sug- gestion of a thing so improbable elicited general and hearty laughter. The quick eye of Miss Jennil, how- ever, caught the slightly significant smile which the Captain: cast upon the ladies, ere he turned away. It was too transient to admit of comment; but how forcibly it came back, when that- ride of forty miles to Kinston found her fleeing from shot and shell, - the ravishing flames of her own home lighting her fiight! But this is anticipating. A glad cry drew the attention of the thronged par- lors to the hall. Through the open door their radi- antly beautiful hostess appeared, leaning on the arm of a tall, dark stranger. A second glance assures us we are right, and, with the crowd, we exclaim, Ralph Bierce!" The exchanged Hatteras prisoner was returned.  &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-237" xml:id="VAC8265-00000121"/>   CHAPTER XXXTL THE RANLROAD BRIDGE SET ON FIRE. NEWBERN is situated at the confluence of the Neuse I and Trent rivers. The latter is spanned by a rail- road bridge, the most extensive and, by far, the most costly structure of the kind in the State. It was the prevailing opinion that Beaufort, a pleasant seaport town, not many miles from Newhern, would be the next- place attacked by the invaders; and, as this bridge afforded transit for troops and army sup- plies for that town, as well as the chain of forts ab6ve and below, it/was necessary that great, cautioni-should- be exercised to preserve it intact. It follows there- fore, that a strong guard and heavy ordnance de- fended its several approaches.- We have left the brilliant coterieat Mr. Bierce's dwelling;, and, as the midnight bell- is arousing dis- tant echoes, we stand upon the shore of the dark Trent, watching a skiff which, with -muffled -ars; drops silently down its unruffled waters. The -small boat hugs the east shore, and, in the friendly shadow of the overhanging trees, escapes the telltale beams of the moon, which, now in her first quarter, hangs low in the west.  The boat nears the bridge, and, for a moment, the-  oarsman lifts his paddle: but no s  ave, c( Who cooks, who cooks," from an owl on the woody shore, breaks the night's stillness.

The wary adventurer strikes the water once, twice, thrice ;v still, no sound comes from the sound sleepers, which the slanting moonbeams display stretched upon the earth, or, with heavy- heads hung low, studying repose with arms locked about muskets, as if danger threatened Rra, not the proud superstructure which bridged those placid waters. The boat now glides boldly out, but is soon lost to sight in the shadow of the middle pier. A half-hour passed, and the sentinel upon the city shore stops his measured tread to gaze upon his com- rade.- Over his face, which his hand supports, (for the soldier had thrown himself upon a pile of timber near,) a bluish light plays. It lights up the grass, trees, and, even now, is reflected from the tall spires and windows 'of the city. The guard leap to their feet, and, upon the night ahir,rings -out sharp and shrill, Fire! fire The' bridge,! the bridge!" Wildly ring the bells; fire- men spring to their engines, to find the hose-punc- tured an'd wholly useless! -and the wind is rising Bythe fmes -which spread slowly a surging mass of beings, a ppalled by the overwhelming ruin which the destruction of the bridge threatens, is seen near: . ing the shore.  And now, above the clamor of the crowd, the crackling flames,-and rushing wind, rises the startled cry, '- The Yankees: are on us." Eyes, distended with fear, see Yankee gunboats adown the river, and ears are horrified by screeching shell from outthe iron monsters.  Mute, terror-smit- ten, the tide, of human life sways back to the city. Horsemen with fixed bayonets dispute the way. c To the bridge, fools: I Cut down the cowards! cries a bold man, charging his horse upon the foremost of   EYE-Wr2asWSS.       239' the struggling mass ;'"to the bridge, or -we are lost I Not a d-d Yankee in sight "  The crowd part before the intrepid dragoon; his fiery words, his mad gallop to the scene of action, staggers them; they waver, they turn, and now, at double quick, rush to the shore. One glance is flashed down the Trent, glowing in the rioting flanmes of the burning bridge; grzm iphan- toms have vanisshed! -  Daybreak sees the flames mastered; and men, faint, scorched, smoked beyond recognition, but ex-, ultant, that their efforts have saved the bridge; move down the city's streets, homeward. Maggie Blout had passed a sleepless night. From her window, she had been a calm observer -of the burning bridge; as the last flame died out, she hid her face in her hands, exclaiming, ' All is lost!" and the low droop of her head spoke of great despondency, almost utter de- spair. In the morning -paper she read- of the unpar- alleled audacity of the midnight incendiary; that, had he accomplished his fiendish -deed,:the forts below and their garrisons would have fallen, without a struggle, into the power of a merciless foe; that it was Yan- kee sympathizers, and the city swarmed with them, who had disabled the engines, raised the cry of "Yankees,", and freed the teeming prison. Farther down, her eye caught a' name which -caused her breath to come quicksand short; and a whiteness overspread her face as she read: ( To the self-pos- session and keen sagacity of Ralph Bierce, one of the returned Hatteras prisoners, who came inthe- even- ing train, ,is our city indebted for its rescue from the overwhelming ruin which threatened it in the loss of the railroad bridge.

That day, and for a week, a vigorous search was instituted for the perpetrator of the diabolical act of firing the bridge. The result of the search was a boat, picked up a mile down the river;; but the com- bustible fluids, the tarred rope, and a well-worn straw hat, found therein, told no tales. v   CHAPTER    XXIt. MAGGIE IN PRISON  FINDS A SICK SOLDIER. IN a low, comfortless room, where, through chiniks in the ill-matched boards which. barred the window, dusty sunbeams wandered, we next meet Maggie Blout. She, too, was a victim:of the relentless per- secution which inaugurated Ralph Bierce's reign as Provost Marshal.               - Men of law, letters, and religion, had been rudely seized, and,. without the slightest investigation of :the charges brought against them,. cast into prison; it was enough that suspicion marked them as Yankee sympathizers.  In the loathsome -cell, on the straw pallet, dividing the coarse food, which -was thrown at them'as if they were indeed kennelled dogs; bear- ing all things, hoping all things, these brave souls, with unflinching spirit, sustained thbe torments of the day; for the light, which led on advancing columns, pierced prison gloom, and, awoke, in them -that--heroioc endurance which bears witness of the c"Godlike that is in man."      - I Maggie had heard of her many friends who had been forced -to exchange the felicitous delights of the home circle, for ;the suspense and incurable aches of prison-life; and, when her summons came she -was ready.  Throughout -her interview with Ralph, she sus-  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC8265-00000124"/> 242       EYE-WITNESS. tained her usual quiet and becoming dignity, coolly parrying his questions where she, herself, was con- cerneJd, and resolutely refusing to utter one word, when commanded to disclose what she knew of the spy,-' Dr. Pill. l "Yes, Margaret," he said, that Dr. Pill was a Yankee spy, and the villain, or one of his accoln- plices, who cut adrift the boat in which we were to make good our retreat, in case Fort Hatteras surren- dered. A man, answering to his appearance, .was seen by Helen on the day of the panic, making good his. escape after robbing our stable of Harry Blout's mare; he afterward came to this city, and, by the most adroit duplicity, palmed himself off upon the Vigilance Committee, as a surgeon disabled in the Bull Run affair, and secured a pass to the Yankee prisoners, as medical attendant. With them, he has disappeared; and there is no longer any reason to doubt he has accomplices in our midst, who drugged the men detailed for sentinel duty the night of the fired, and then cleared the way for his own and prison- friends' escape. His coat and boots, which none other but a Yankee clodhopper could wear, have been found on your premises." "The Yankees are reckoned a ' particular cute nation, " was Maggies reply, in no way disconcerted by the searching look which Ralph fixed upon her. c- Speak, Margaret, and tell me what you know of this Yankee- spy, or your traitorous deeds shall costyou your liberty, - your-" he stopped. ' Go on, Ralph," was the calmv rejoinder; " you would not hesitate to hang-any of the men you have arrested on suspicion of loyalty to the Federal Gov- ernment; and can I, whom you know to be uncondi-   EYE-WITNESS.        243 tionally loyal, expect clemency of you, who sunk to the lowest depths of infamy when you swore fealty-to treasorn's instigators." "The undisturbed seclusion of the apartments which I have assigned you, and simple diet, may, possibly, temper your bold speech, Margaret; I will see you again to-morrows" He tapped for a subordinate, and that official fol- lowed Maggie to the carriage in waiting. '"The Whitney House, Elm St.," he shouted to the driver, and the carriage rolled away. The third day of her imprisonment, -which, Ialph said on his last visit, promised to be a long one, Maggie detained the negro keeper, and obtained the following information:-         , "After a week's labor, the bridge would be pas- sable; that everybody seemed to be in a mighty, hurry, as if something was going to happen'; that men on the street said, ' A week rnore^ and, if at- tacked, we shall be able to give the Yankees particu- lar fits ;' that several arrests had -been made the past E two days, and sent off Kinston way; and that the man who groaned so in the next- room was a sick soldier from Beaufort, who had been dying a long time, and, as the money was all gone, he would be - nursed no longer." Maggie watched that night with th. sick man; , and, as, by the dim light of a wretched ,tallow dip," she gazed pitifully down upon, the ghastly face of the sufferer, it seemed to her that every breath-he drew served to hasten dissolution. ? '  "Poor man I " she exclaimed, as she- moistened his parched and shrunken lips; '( such suffer'ag as yours must atone for the sin of treason.' The first  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC8265-00000125"/> EYE-WITNESS. hours of the night, the soldier moaned and tossed, as if in great pain: and, as. Maggie had done allher limited resources allowed for his relief, she sat down upon the hard floor beside the pallet, and, to sustain her own fainting heart, sang a low chant. The paroxysms of Pain grew less violent, and, be- fore the strain was finished, tte soldier lay motion- less. At first, Maggie could not realize the magical effect of her chant; then it occurred to her that she' had read instances where music had been resorted to to soothe the last agonies of the dying. On the burden of. her melody had that poor soul winged its flight? She hoped so; but no, there -was a feeble pulse, and the chest moved lightly as-in natural sleep. "'So sweet a sleep will prove a salutary remedy; the sick man may yet live to make glad some watch- ing, aching heart," she thought, and turned away. Upon the roof-the rain fel-in torrents, and patter, patter, came the drops upon the wretched floor. As Maggie placed the saucer which held the "feeble dip," beyond the flow of the rivulets streaming from the broken ceiing, the sick man moved, and, as his nurse bent over his pallet, ( Sing," came faintly. She sang some plaintive melodies, sweet and low, so low at-last, it was as if. an angel whispered. Mag- gie slept,  "Margaret.

But it came no more. The dreary silence, which dragged the hours of the following morning, was broken by the thunder of ar- tillery.  ", They are but trying their guns atthe forts," the ; watcher in the Whitney House sighed; and her hands, which she had clasped in an ecstasy of de- light, as the report, so loud, so near, brought her to her feet, with the shout, "They have come at last!" dropped to her side, and again she sank upon the floor. "Who have come, the Yankees?" As Maggie turned to reply, she met the wild stare of the soldier, who had been roused by the guns, and was now supporting himself upon his elbow. The light from the window -fell full upon both faces; their eyes met. The sick man's, then unnaturally  brilliant, suddenly dilated with irrepressible joy ; a convulsive twitching of the lips followed; then his outstretched, trembling arms sank down, his eyes closed, and he fell back upon his pallet. ("Poor creature!" sighed Maggie, as she sprung to his side, and looked down upon his face, stamped with the rigidity of death; " can it be there is life -and hope for you, in the coming of the Yankee?" As she spoke, some sudden thought made her scan closely the white, gaunt; face before her  "' it -is the: Yankee soldier," she cried:; the one 21*      &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC8265-00000126"/> 246        EYE-wnTNEss. Harry said must die; but how could so benevolent a heart permit this poor soul to be so neglected?  The-door of tieroom was, at this moment, swung open violently. " Quick, missis, quick!" her keep- er shouted,; (' them's Yankee guns. Hear 'em bust  Gol-ee, what a big one " -Before Maggie could offer any remonstrance to the movement, she was thrust into -the apartment :as- signed her; she saw that her daily food was spread, and she knew that the closing door must debar her, for another long day, from intercourse from without. Quickly she drew, from the folds of her dress, her watch, and shook it before her excited keeper.  As if struck with a magician's wand, the door .stood wide open. - Dat r is a real beauty, sure. What does missis want for dat?"  ' A-doctor,: medicines, and some clothes, for, the sick soldier,--Dinah, and it is yours. See, these are diamonds:; some one will buy the watch of you, and give you a handsomnie sum for it." ' Diriah held out her black, bony hand; while her hideously ugly face glowed with the exultant joy which the possession of such a trinket could alone ex- cite. "The doctor and medicines, first, Dinah..  The eager hands/fell, and a scowl heightened the  habitual :repulsiveness of that brutal, face; while, in the deep gutturals of her race, she muttered: :"Now, dis miniti: White folks tink niggers cheat."

These are his words:-- '(- The -ship, in which I sailed from New York, was wrecked off this coast last, October, and, with the survivors of another wreck, I was brought to this town.

An attack upon this city was then daily expected; and the jailer said, (, Old prisoners  must be sent off to make rpom for-new ones."'

The Provost Marshal had use for the house which we occupied, and- had us removed into a dilapi- dated bhilding in the heart of the city. The, removal was made in the, midst of a drenching rain, and, tak- , ing a severe cold, a relapse of fever- followed. For days I was unconscious; once it seemed as if I lay on the battle-field, dying- of thirst, so hidden from sight as to escape the observation of the ambulance corps. The flitting of the-death-angel, whose icy touch had chilled to endless rest thousands on the same bloody plain, drew near. A vague sensation of some loved presence at my side made me turn from the stern figure bending over me, and I heard a voice which thrilled my inmost being. I knew it, Annie; it was not unlike your own.  I was spellbound. Once the voice ceased, and again came- the flutter of those dark wings; but-the song, which wasto me the elixir of life, rose up anew. The delightful trance, which followed, I cannot describe satisfacto- rily; a beautiful being seemed ever to be leading me on by her bewitching notes, by silvery streams, up beauteous banks ,through fields redolent with nature's blooms,  On and on we went, she ever turned from me, ever eluding my grasp.

There were six ladies and myselfinf the ambulance; and, with the exception of one, from- their conversation, I should judge they -were on' their- journey home.' Two of them were wives of' officers taken in a recent skirmish on the road we were travelling, then on their way to the Yankees, hoping to be allowed to go North to share 'their husbands' captivity. The other four were in search of effects left behind, and, if permission were granted them, o remain within Federal lines. All were bitter Secessionists, and it is certainly not un- becoming in me to avow that, from  my heart', I wished that those whom they so unmercifully reviled, might refuse them every petition they made, Some little idea of their -conversation may be gathered from the following, which, if not very courteously worded, was certainly expressive of -decidedly ruffled feelings. (Young lady left behind in the Newhern panic) - "' t It s, indeed, too true that the conductor, and not the terrified passengers, who put him up d'to disobey orders,/is the special object of our gallaht General's wrath.

(Stranger, sharply)  " ' If, in your censure, you include Gen. Runn, you malign a character you know-nothing of.

"An unbroken silence followed the speaker's em- phatic words; perhaps the ladies felt some compunc- tions of conscience for their free speech; if so, they expressed none.

A fold of cloth covers her face all but her mouth, through' which her breath comes intermittent. Two watchers, one on each side, alone are near her in her death agony,- Helen Bierce, and poor sightless Vine. "Lift me, Vine, and place the cushion at my back; there, that will do; now, Helen, you and Vine take my hands; I annnot see you, but I must feel you, while I utter my last words." The door opens, and a step is- heard. "Is that you, Charles?" and, as the one welcomed by an ex- pressive glance from Helen, drew near, and knelt down, the sufferer resumed- "You have all been kind to me. No act of mine, but God's mercy, has made you so, and RHe will re- ward you,---He, who took from me   my sight, but let light into my soul, black with sin, and revealed to me  blessed visions of a bright and living world, after night here.

It was for my jewels I  re-entered the burning house; I got them, but lost all, save this faint spark of life, which soon,   EYE-WITNESS.       273 now, will expire. The beam fell across mny face; Francis tried to lift it, but it was beyond his strength, and he left me to get aid. The Yankees found me; they carried me ,to the hospital, and cared for me ten- derly; they told me my burns were of such a nature that I could not live. The torment, the torture, and agony of those days, found relief at-last. A soldier was dying near me; a chaplain daily talked and prayed with him; and, although my stubborn heart at first refised to admit the truths he uttered, it yielded, and finally craved them. I called the chap- lain to me; he asked me ' if I ever prayed? I told him ' noo;' he said ' it was time,' and requested me to repeat after him the Lordls Prayer. I did so, and from that moment, all that, which was to me stern and awful in religion, vanished; for the ' peace which passeth all understanding,' was mine. c; You found me, Helen, a burnt and sightless be- ing; you found Vine, also, and removed us here; and, for your devotion to us both, God, who is ever near, will bless you. :"Charles Coxe, I do not ask you how you discov- ered Helen through her disguise. I do, not -care to know, so long/as I am sensible she has yielded to the voice of truth-and passion. My legacy to you both, is Vine, - poor sightless Vine, made so by my hand, and, for- which sin, I have passed through a fiery fur- nace, but found beyond ' the everlasting arms.' "Vine, be to Helen what, for the last few months, you have been to me. You have been wicked; I made you so, and God has forgiven us both." The sinking woman's voice failed her; and, as slight spasms passed over her wasted frame,- they laid her tenderly down, and, with moist eyes, waited   .

With a convulsive motion of the thin, white hands, and a quiver of the lips, it passed. An hour later, and Charles and Helen sat at the open window. The soft, calm light, from without, reveals traces of great and recent emotion upon Hel- en's face, and repeatedly, and fervently, she} presses her brother's diary to her lips as if it were, indeed, a sentient things Lifting her streaming eyes to the star-lit canopy above her, she breathed - "Willie, your appeal is not in vain; I uwill' do all to the glory of God.' Heaven grant- that my heart,- once so cold with pride and self-will, may yieldto be directed by a zeal as ardent and endur- ing-as your own.' She ceased to speak, and other thoughts, which she cared not to utter, kept- her eyes still bent upon the distant heavens. A moved, low voice at her side aroused her; and, yielding to the tender caress, whichlf, as his affianced bride, she had no wish to withhold, she murmured - - "Yes, Charley.  To-morrow is Maggie's wed- ding-day. You will see her; then tell, her all." ( And my mother i " Helen turned, and pointing to the dead, said: "I i' Your promise is no longer binding." After a few moments of increasing emotion, she sobbed: " Moth- er's death -has taught me how easy a thing it is to die; buiit what a- frightful thing it is to live, and not rightly!" .      -  -":'To know the right, and nobly to live up to it;, - is glorious," Charles, said cheerfully: and, wishing to divert her thoughts from the channel of bitter regret, hie resumed, layinmg his hand upon the papers, still in her trembling grasp-   EYE-WITNESS.        275 "You do not ask me how I obtained these.' ',The satisfaction of having them is complete; there is no room for curiosity; " with something of her former- animation in voice and manner, she added, "I saw Harry Blout in the hospital wards to- day; and so overwhelming was my surprise, for I thought him long since dead, that, involuntarily, his name escaped'me. He turned towards me, but I had recovered my composure, anid, conscious that I was not recognized, I ventured a remark about one of the patients." To Helen's infinite amazement, her companion re- lated to her Harry's motives for taking the field-; his adventures under the assumed name of Dr. Pill, and bis long and unavailing search- for her and her fath- er's family, while-in Secessia: "And,fHelen, he re- turned but yesterday to Newhern, to be present at his Cousin Maggie's wedding. Accompanying him, were several Union friends; among the number he mentioned John McGowan, who, through the influ- ence of powerful partisans, was recently released from imprisonment, -- his son Frank, having secured his escape some two months since, from like suffering. One other he alluded to most feelingly,-a Mrs. Weasel, whose husband died in Salisbury-; her chil- dren are "those you have often seen with Maggie Blout. Helen, dear Helen," he added most ear- nestly, " you must see Harry before the next flag leaves, - for he goes back to remain, he tells me, and hear the account of his travels through the west- ern part of the State. There, Union men, escaped from desolated homes, jails, and swamps, -do congre- gate, armed -with a determination to-maintain their rights, which sets dangers and tyranny at defiance. *    fi  st   I       .",  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC8265-00000141"/> 276,       EYE'WITIVNSSo And who, think you, is ,their avowed and devoted ' leader?

The mighty impulses of' his soul have been stirred to achieve mighty ends; and, with his unbounded lodve for the Federal Gov- ernment, who that hears him, and knows his cour- age, intrepidity, and unflinching purpose, can doubt that, to its sovereignty, he will yet gloriously return his adopted State." ( His field is yours, Charley.
