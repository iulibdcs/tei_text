He skiimmed the ponds, and breathed upon them his icy breath, and along the windows wrote his name in such fan- tast3tic shapes that the very chldren would roar with laughter, and point out to their parents the little tree-work and pic- tures that old Frost had left, when they opened their eyes to the morning light. There were hills and plains, and mountain-tops, and -every little while a fir-tree or a withered branch, which, as the wintry sun glittered on the sash, would seem to sparkle and be glad that it had been left there to please the --yopng hearts.

Then she thought of the merry sleigh-rides, and the beaux which would accompany her. Vain girl, was she not? "Blessed winter!" said the school-boy, as he looked abroad on the hill and plain at the sparkling snow, that everywhere covered the surface, and bid fair to allow him many a fine coasting frolic, while the ice gave him evident joy in antici- pation of fine skating on its glassy surface. "Blessed winter!" said the weary fainmer, who all summer long had been industrious, and had laid in a fair amount of winter stock, and was not sorry to rest a while from weary toil; his cattle well housed, his barns filled with provender, and his grounds cleared up and in order. "Winter again!" said the lonely widow, as she looked at her scant supply of coal and wood. "God grant it may be an easy one!" Mortal! blame not the Lord for what he may send you, but look abroad upon his works, and be glad you are able to look, and don't grumble; reflect how many are worse off, a thousand times, than you are, and don't cast reflections, when, as you are not a mere looking-glass, you have no real right to reflect at all, unless he gives you permission to do so. How few there are who are satisfied with matters as they are, but who would like something a little different; no matter how little! You who are clad in your sables and stone martens, - you who fare sumptuously every day, -forget not there is many a poor Lazarus, whose shelter is poor, even if he have a shelter at all; and, while you are thankful for your superior advan- tages, show your thanks by your benevolent actions and your   RATE STANTON.            7 deeds of charitable benevolence. Why send your money to endow foreign missions, when at your own door are those who are every way worthy of your aid and support, and in aiding whom you know just where your surplus funds are be-. stowed, and how worthily? Far be it from me to condemn actions of benevolence and. deeds of charity, and certainly not such as our New England princes are famed for achieving; but let a goodly supply tf your overplus be placed at your own door, and at firesides where its effeet may be seen and felt at large. Give me the man who bestows his wealth unostentatiously, be it much or little; it is like the widw's mite cast into the Jewish treasury--her heart went with it. Yes, Winter, with all its gloomy sadness of aspect, its bleak and unyielding front, is nevertheless welcome. Winter all around us. Everything we see and feel makes , the old blood chill in our veins! How the snow comes down  Each little particle dancing down, down, down, quietly taking its place amid its brother and sister flakes, till it seems they are all one family of flakes. How they chase each other through the air, as though each were vying to see which shall first reach its station on mother earth; and then, when fairly deposited, how each little fellow seems to rest, as though it knew just where it belonged, and not a bit indignant that another of the family should plump down beside it! Snow on! snow on! How beautiful you look! And now the last has fallen, and there they all lie in that beauty of intimacy, hardly to be likened to anything human, but only divine. - -4*  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6993-00000005"/> 8          KATE  STANTON. There is no winter away up there above, where they all started from, but a bright and all-seeing Omnipotence. God grant it that there be no winter in our hearts! "O, Winter! ruler of the inverted year, Thy scattered hair with sleet like ashes filled, Thy breath congealed upon thy lips, thy checks Fringed with a beard made white with other snows  Than those of age, thy forehead wrapped in clouds, A leafless branch thy sceptre, and thy throne A sliding car, indebted to no wheels, But urged by storms along its slippery way; I love thee, all unlovely as thou sccm'st, And dreaded as thou art."

It was the winter wild, While the heaven-born child All newly wrapt in the rude manger lies; Nature in awe to him Has doffed her gaudy trim, With her great Master so to sympathize! MLTON. THE wind shook violently an old wooden tenement in the north part of the city, and the old windows rattled, and the driving snow beat against them. The carpet rose and fell upon the floor, in furious undulations, as a strong current of air found its way under the crazy door. It was a raw and chilly night, and the few who were necessarily abroad but- toned their coats close around their throats, and involuntarily shut their eyes as their faces braved the frozen sleet. Within, a cheerful fire was blazing; and, although poverty was an inmate there, contentment seemed to reign, and each article of the somewhat scanty supply of furniture was so arranged as fully to testify that the occupants, in all their troubles, were people of neat and cleanly habits; and the attempt to make the best out of a little showed plainly that, as the phrase goes, "they had seen better days!"

Consumption had wasted her form; and her sunken cheeks, and hollow cough, gave too certain indication that the time of her final dissolu. tion and departure was drawing near. And she was ready to go when the dread messenger, that never calls upon us but once, should arrive and beckon her away; for she had lived the life of a true Christian, and her lamp was trimmed and burning. Her faith was strong, and the hope of a blissful ilmmortality beamed brightly within her breast. Life had been dear to her, though the last few years had been those of toil and labor. Her early days were pleasant, and memory, still green and youthlful, brought freshly before her, in vivid coloring, the recollection of many a heartfelt gratification and pleasurable satisfaction, which disease and privation had vainly attempted to eradicate and destroy. Her father died in her infancy, but left his only darling in charge of his brother, Mr. Robert Parsons, who reared her tenderly, and, until her marriage with Edward Stanton, she occupied his house and home. He, a bachelor, and alone in the world, was cheered by the smiles and devoted affection of his darling niece, and sought every means that wealth could afford, to make her contented and   happy. H e gave her a  good education, and stored her mind with all that was useful and beneficial, and instilled upon her   heart those precepts and  principles of action  which in after years descended to hler children. Edward Stanton, her husband, reared in the counting-house of Mr. Parsons,  on his retiring, sueeeded to' his prosperous business; but, lacking that inborn, indwelling tact, which edu-   c  KATE STANTON.           " cation rarely brings, however thorough it may be, his affairs did not prosper; but, in course of years, became embarrassed to so great an extent that failure was inevitable; and fail he did, carrying with him in his ruin a large amount of his young wife's property, which had been left her by her uncle, who died shortly before her husband's bankruptcy became known. Harassed and disheartened, pursued by his relentless cred- itors, and rendered almost frantic by their unceasing impor- tunities, he sought a refuge in the far-off West, leaving behind him that wife, now so miserable, and two darling chil- dren, a boy and girl, the idols of their devoted mother, and the only earthly solace and comfort of her lonely days. Edward did not intend to desert his family, but was in hopes of finding some opening, when, settled once more, and established in business, he could send for them and provide a new home. He lived on, and on, but trouble followed upon trouble, and soon his letters homeward became less and less frequent, till, finally, his whereabouts became unknown, and the loved ones at home mourned for him, and, lastly, gave him over as dead. The residue of his wife's property, owing to bad manage- ment and poor securities, dwindled away to almost nothing. And now, behold her in life's last scene, her beloved daugh- ter Kate sitting by her bedside, now attending to such varied wants as a confirmed invalid always requires and demands, and now completing some needle-work, upon which, or upon the profits of which labor, she was barely able to keep the  family together, ]particularly at this inclement season, when everything was high in price.                        l  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6993-00000007"/> 12        IKATE STANTON. William, the brother of Kate, and two years her junior, still continued at school, as his mother, even in her weak and dependent state, was unwilling he should lose the benefit of such an education as the public school could afford him; and, as he was an apt scholar, seemed to be benefiting by the instructions he received. She had intended he should fol- low some profession,--that of a lawyer or physician,-- particularly as his views were of a kindred nature; but she could not educate him upon her slender means, and hoped, if he could remain at school two years longer, then he could, at sixteen years of age, enter some store where he could earn a livelihood. "Where is William?" said Mrs. Stanton, as she woke from an uneasy slumber. "I sent him to the apothecary's," said Iate; "he will be here soon; but, as the prescription the doctor left you re- quired the making of some pills, it may take him some time longer." "  I am glad that for a few moments he is absent, as I want to say that to you, my Kate, which I had rather inform you of before he returns. I am about changing worlds, my dear daughter. I feel the death-damp upon my brow; and the chilly feeling throughout my whole frame seems to warn me that my final change is near. I cannot talk much, nor, as you see, very distinctly; but, in the intervals of my coughing fits, I will try to make you understand a dying mother's re- quests." "O, say not so, dear mother! You are fatigued to-night, !   KATE STANTON.          13 your sleep has been broken; you will not die yet, dear mother." (Yes, my daughter; be not deceived with any vain hope. Die I must, and I fear that the morning light will be the sig- nal light to bear me away. For myself I do not fear; I am willing to go; but I fear for my children. You, my dear IKate, are now only sixteen years of age, and it becomes you to have a sister's eye to the welfare of your brother. William is a good boy, and I doubt not will do all he can, and give you as little trouble as possible; but he is still a boy, and has a boy's feelings." ;' True, dear mother; but he has already a man's heart, and there seems to flow in his bosom a firm desire to do what he can. He asked me this morning to persuade you to let him earn something, to help us along; but I was unwilling to worry you at present in your weak state. I know that he loves me sincerely, and will do all he can to please me." "I am glad to hear you say so, Kate; and you must try that it may be always so; and in a great degree it rests with you, that it shall, or shall not, be so. But, as he grows to man's estate, he will feel the man within him, and may not be willing to submit to a woman for his government." "Fear not for me, dear mother," said William, who had just entered unperceived in the dimly-lighted chamber. "(I love you both, and it shall be my constant care to do all in my power to please you both." :' I do not doubt it, dear son; and know, then, that, for my- self, I hope to be allowed to look upon you both from the land of spirits, whither I am now fast hastening; and may I always find you both affectionate and loving. 2  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6993-00000008"/> "        KATE STANTON. "I do not know whether I may be permitted to watch over you; but, before I depart, let mia urge you both to guard well yourselves. You, Kate, had better go on with such work as you now obtain, unless your health should suffer; and you, my son, must seek something as an occupation that will aid your sister in a pecuniary way. You are almost a man in size; you must be a man in feeling, and in determination. "Have fewfriends; but make no enemies. Have no con- fidants; but keep no secrets from each other. Whatever you wish to do, William, consult with Kate about, and if you both agree, I think you will do little wrong. I say have few friends, for while you are poor, you will scarce find many; and, should you ever grow wealthy, those few, if they are real friends, will be as many as you will need. "I feel I am growing weaker, and each breath I draw seems to come heavily. There is a dead weight upon my chest, and the room feels close, and the air heavy. "Open the window a little way, Kate, and then close the shutter upon it again." Kate did as she was requested. The snow had ceased to fall, the fleecy clouds were fast dispersing, ande the pale full moon was coursing through the heavens, and the stars just venturing forth as the clouds separated; and each star twinkled, as, ushering in the natal day of the Lord, the Christ- mas bells began to chime. "What do I hear, Kate?" said her mother. The Christmas chimes, mother." ( And on this day I die. O, glorious privilege! O, my children, remember me; and, O, remember that Saviour, who died for us all! Kiss me, dear ones!"   Ci KATE STANTON.                  15 She lay silent a few moments, and then faintly resumed: "If you look in the lower drawer of my bureau, Kate, you will find a sealed packet. It contains my miniature, taken many years since, and a present from your father on my wedding day. You will always keep this sacred, I know. True I do not now resemble it much; but when it was painted it was said to be a striking likeness, and your father valued it much; but why he left it behind him, when he went away, I know not. ,I If he should ever be heard from, or visit the home of his early days, the possession of this, together with its com- panion in the other case, which is his own portrait, - though not so true a likeness, - will be sufficient identification; and your resemblance to me will be an additional aid. "In the inside of my wedding ring are his initials and the date, - I -I-  cannot say - " She said no more.  Life's last words were said in those that spoke of her long-lost husband; but her outstretched arms fondly clasped her children to her breast, and folded them long in a last embrace. A playful smile was on her face, and her look seemed to say good-by. Kate opened once more the shutter, and the rising sun lit up the silent face; but, O, so cold and motionless! The snow lay on the ground so calm and purely white, and the air was still! Within that chamber all was peace.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6993-00000009"/> CHAPTER     III. Doubts and uncertainties, uncertainties and doubts, Keep men in pecks o' trouble, and children in the pouts! Pray keep up your courage, man, be ne'er cast down! Ye maun na know vexation, save ye 're thrawn the town. X)   AULD BLACKLIE. THE last sad rites were over. The orphan children stood together in the room once rendered cheerful by her whom they mourned; but now how changed! All that before had ren- dered home lovely had now departed;^tTd the very empti- ness of the room, though still filled with the same furniture, yet looked to them as though there were nothing there whatever. "Well, Kate, what do you propose to do now?" said William. "( We can hardly live here; and yet I don't like to leave the old spot, worn and crazy as the house is." "I was just thinking of that," said Kate, " and am glad you asked the question, for I did not like to speak of it first; and yet it must be thought of, and that right speedily. It is now the twenty-seventh, and the quarter is up on the first of January.  The landlord will hardly renew to such irrespon- sible persons as we' must now be considered. As minors, we :/   KATE STANTON.          1.7   cannot take this on a lease, and, even if we could, I feel as if I could do little myself, at present at least." (I know that," said William, "and we know no one who would be bound for the punctual payment of the rent; so go we must. At any rate, the man cannot turn us out till quar- ter-day. Let me see, -four days left to look about in." "And little time enough, too," replied Kate; " but it is of no use to worry about that. If you can find some employ- ment that will part pay, I may be able to help you to the rest. We must rent two rooms somewhere, or else sell our furniture, and then board; and as provisions are so high, it might be better to sell at once; but this dear old furniture! I hate to sell it." "So do I," said William; "it would not bring much. They say furniture goes for a mere song now-a-days, except it be antique; and we have none of that, though it looks an- tique with the wear it has had. I don't want to see mother's chair sold. There's nothing pretty about it, but it is enough that she always used it." "It need not be sold, William. If we board, we could partly furnish our own rooms, and whoever took us could not object to that." "Well, then let us keep all for the present; for, if you say keep the chair, and I should add the table, equally precious, why, we should go through till we had enumerated all there is here." i  "Now, William," continued Kate, "what is to be done? The same families who have given me sewing to do, will, of course, continue, for all I can see. But what will you do?" "That's the trouble. I have hands, and am able and will- 2* I   &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6993-00000010"/> 18         KATE STANTON. ing to use them, and, of course, must do so, and give up my  schooling--though that is hard, too; but I have, I think, made some progress, so that I could do something at home evenings with my books, even if I worked all day abroad. Mr. Barnes wants some more boys to tend his bowling alleys; but I don't exactly like to go there, for it does not sound well. And as to selling papers for a living, that is rather precarious, unless I except steamer days, and horrid accidents, etc.; then papers sell well, and the most of the boys make way with all they can get. I think I will try Mr. Barnes till something better offers." " , William, I don't like it! You an alley-boy!" -. "Well, what shall I do? There is no occupation for a boy of fourteen. Were I sixteen, some store would offer; but no one takes a boy so young." "But you would be spoiled in two years, in a bowling- alley." "Not while I have a loving sister at home, who feels for me, and who I know is caring for me all day long." ("Well, you may as well try there. You'ieed not stay any longer than you can do better; but remember mother's precepts, and avoid temptation." "To-morrow we must set out together, and hunt up board, We shall find some one, no doubt, who will take us; and now let us prepare for rest," said William. "We have undergone enough for a season; let us not worry about temptations now. But be assured, dear sister, I will not suffer myself to be led astray." God grant you may not be! but there are so many temp.   KATE  STANTON.          19 tations in cities, that I look about me with horror and dread, not daring to think what may be ahead."  ( Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,'" replied William. "Let us not borrow trouble; the Lord has sent us enough in reality, to which we must humbly submit. Though you are older than I am, yet, I cannot help feeling the man in me, and the desire to see you cared for, as I feel quite strong myself." ( O, William, be not vain-glorious, or too self-confiding!" "I will not, dear sister, more than I can help; so let us together pray for aid from Him who alone can give it." The following day found them, ere its close, the tenants of two rooms at Mrs. Maitland's, a widow lady, who agreed to board them as reasonably as she could; as, she said, she herself was poor, but " did not want to make any money out of them." Thither they moved their furniture, and the old chair and table found a snug resting-place, and really the rooms did look home-like. And now, having settled them for the present, it would seem somewhat proper to say, for the benefit of those curious in such matters, what sort of looking body our Kate was, and how she 1X: dressed, how she wore her hair, and whether or not she was handsome.  Well, she was tall for her age; not very strong, as an in- door life, and waiting and watching over a sick-bed, are not very conducive to rosy cheeks, and a healthful and blooming complexion; but she was comely, well-proportioned, and withal a girl of sense. Her hair of a jet-black, and glossy,  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6993-00000011"/> 20        KATE  STANTON. and a pair of bright sparkling eyes, which, except when suf- fering and bereavement dimmed them, shone forth like two mirrors, reflecting all objects within her reach; and her gentle- ness of disposition, and perfect amiability of character, ren- dered her an object of interest to the few who knew her, and often attracted some who did not know her, but who gazed upon her placid face as she passed along the street. And what may be said of William? you ask. Why, simply this, that he was almost the image of his sister Kate, except that he was robust and vigorous, and apparently better able to contend with the buffets and hard knocks of this life. They neither of them approved of much mourning apparel; in part that they could ill afford it, and more especially as their grief was sincere and internal, and required no external em- blazonment. On the first of January, William went. to Mr. Barnes' bowling-alley, in -  street; a large brick building, hand- somely fitted for the purpose for which it was intended. The lower floor contained an "office," as it is called now- a-days, where orders for rooms were received, liquors mixed, and temperance bitters manufactured; and adjoining which was a small room, where were assembled and penned, as it were, some twenty boys, whose duty it was to tend the various alleys. Each boy was numbered, a little figure or figures being placed in his cap, in front, in a conspicuous position. Each boy was obliged to keep the alley, corresponding to his number, in perfect order, to sweep it out each day, and to see that everything about it was scrupulously neat. The i   jt        HbKATE STANTON.         21 boys were required to be present from eight o'clock in the morning, during the winter, until ten o'clock at night. Much of their time was passed in the pen already men- tioned, as the alleys, of course, were not always in use. What was William Stanton's experience will be found in another chapter.

W VELL, Stanton, you know the rules of the place; you must be either one of us in full communion, or you must fight us all, one at a time. You can't establish your place among us, till we know something of your spunk." "I won't fight," said William, " and I won't play cards with you. I am here for work, and while I stay I will work and mind my business; and let me see if you cannot mind yours, too." "I A coward! a coward!" shouted several voices. "A ring! a ring! let's see what he is made of!" "I am no coward, as you will find, if you don't let me alone. I am not to be trifled with, however; and, though I will not strike the first blow, if I am hit once, I will not be struck twice by the same hand. So look to it each of you, and stand your turns; for, if you do compel me to act in my de- fence, it will go hard with some of you. So take fair warning." "Let him alone, Ned Akers," said Charles Morley. "I will stick up for Bill Stanton; so you just quit your fooling, or I will see who is master myself."   KATE STANTON.           23 Charles Morley was a boy of courage, and, being the oldest and strongest of the group, the rest were awed by him, and "kept under," when he was present. No one dared to-compete with him alone, and William had now good reason to thank him for his interference. The boys were not usually quarrelsome, but they liked to prove a new hand.  William's manliness, and Morley's burly appearance, when determined, as he now was, checked further discord. , Light up number five!" shouted Barnes, through the speaking-tube. This was William's alley, and he stepped forward to obey. "That's right, move quick!" shouted two or three voices in derision; but no more violence was manifested, and William went to his work with alacrity, and a determination to " act well his part," though to him a very repulsive one. Number five was in the second story of the building, and thither he went, and was soon followed by a party of young men, four in all, who evidently showed unmistakable signs that on this evening, certainly, this was not the first house of entertainment they had visited. Of the four mentioned, but one, however, had the appear- ance of being much the worse from his libations. His name was Burton; and he was a very hard-looking character. The other three had the manners of those accustomed to good living, and were probably young men of respectability, when e! temptation was not too great for them to withstand. "Up with the pins!" cried Burton; "set up the pins, ; I young lazy-bones!" William did as he was ordered, He had taken the busi-  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6993-00000013"/> 24        KATE STANTON. ness in hand, and, having done so, he determined to succeed, and to do his duty to his employer to his utmost ability; but he had far under-estimated the duties of the office he had assumed. He could "set 'em up," and he did this well throughout the evening, picking up the spent balls and re- turning them down the ball-trough, and dodging them as they came every way around him, as thrown by hands too unsteady to often reach the mark at which they were supposed to have been aimed. One thing, however, he did not expect to be called upon to perform. The bell was rung for various " colored mixtures; " perhaps it was only molasses and water; perhaps, mind you; but, from the results that followed, there was evidently something besides. "Now for some fun!" cried Burton. "( Let's get this young chap drunk, and see how he will look among the pins!" "No you don't do any such thing, while I am here!" ex. claimed one, whose name was :Maxwell, and who was the best conditioned of the party. "We 'll see about that," said Burton. "Here, young scapegrace, come here and drink; it's all paid for." "I shall do no such thing," said William. , You won't, will you?" said Burton. "No, I won't!" exclaimed William, firmly. "I 'll see what you mean by won't, then. Do you mean you won't drink what's in that glass? What 's the reason you won't?" "It 's against my principles," said William. "Ha! ha! ha!" cried Burton. "Principles! Look here,   KATE STANTON.           25 fellows; did you hear him say principles? Principles! and in an alley-boy! Why, man, such things don't grow in such kind of soil. An alley-boy has no business with principles. You must be green as grass, young man. But drink you shall, and that at once. Here, take this tumbler." William refused with vehemence. "Why, then," said the ruffian, "I 'll make you!" and, seiz- ing the glass, he rushed upon the boy, and attempted to force it down his throat, when his hand was stayed by the interfer- ence of Maxwell, and a severe struggle ensued; whereupon the quarrelsome fellow, releasing the hand, with one desperate effort, that still held the glass, though no longer its contents, as the fluid had been lost in the scuffle, threw the tumbler with full force at William's head. Too true the aim, and severe the result. Down fell the boy, and broken glass was scattered around the hall. Maxwell ran to him ; the blood was oozing from a severe cut just above the left eye, and a portion of the glass seemed sticking to the wound. The boy lay still, apparently sense- less; at any rate, he made no answer to ar question put to him, and Maxwell looked as if he thought him in a critical idly state. On turning round, he found that Burton had skulked away, without so much as inquiring how much mischief he had done, and probably afraid to wait the consequences of the deed. Maxwell was humane, and now determined, as he could not help the occurrence, at least to do all in his power to aid the boy, and alleviate the poor fellow's distress. "Where do you live, young man?" said he, gently. Wil-   &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6993-00000014"/> 26        KATE STANTON. liam made no reply; but, the blood still oozing from the wound, Maxwell rang for water, while his two remaining comn panions were too much stupefied and bewildered to offer any assistance. Maxwell gently raised him up, and, with the aid of the waiter who answered the bell, placed him on a settee, and bathed his face plenteously. The cold water revived the boy at once. "How do you feel, my poor fellow?" said Maxwell. "Where amn I?" said William, "and what has hap- pened? Why, I am quite wet, and faint too!" Maxwell told him what the cause had been; but William seemed much hurt and somewhat delirious.  A conscious moment being seized before he again sunk into a sort of in- sensibility, he told where he lived, and, a carriage being at once procured, he was gently placed in it, and accompanied by his friend to his home. "Hark!" said Mrs. Maitland, "' a carriage at our door, and so late in the evening; what can it mean? Why, I have had no visitor for a long time; and so late, too!" said she, as she looked out of the window. "I can see two in it," said Kate, as the hack stopped just in front of the street lamp, "and they are helping out a third;" and she ran to the door. "This is Mrs. Maitland's, I believe," said one. "It is," said Kate, " and whom have you there? Why, it is my brother, and in this condition! O, what dreadful thing has happened to him? Speak, somebody! Is he   ?" Poor Kate, she dared not utter the word; a thousand thoughts and feelings shot through her system, and she felt   .. Ki sKATE STANTON.               27  very like swooning; but, nerving herself to the work be- fore her, she impatiently waited for more information. This was not long coming; but, as it could not be given in the cold street, the senseless form was conveyed within, be- tween the other two, who did not keep Kate in as long sus- pense as it takes to write it.  "He is not dead," said the surgeon, whom Maxwell had called for, on the way home, and who occupied the other place by William's side; "but he is seriously hurt, I think, and wants gentle nursing. I could give him but little exam- ination while in the carriage; by your leave I will do so now. "Will you please, Mrs. Maitland," he continued, ( furnish me with some cloth for ba-ndages? And you, my dear girl, compose yourself; your brother, though badly and cruelly injured, need not die, if you can keep him quiet for a few) days. He will be somewhat wild, and perhaps delirious, at times, but I think you can manage him; don't let him talk much, and keep the room partially darkened." Kate promised everything that was required, and the good doctor, after applying some adhesive plasters, and tightly bandaging the forehead, left his young patient to rest. "I shall call again soon," said he, as he took his leave;  "but if I should not, it may be well not to give your brother much stimulating food. Everything depends upon keeping the blood in a cool state."  "I wil do all," returned Kate, "and, with God's blessing,   my brother shall do well." "I have to thank you, sir," said she to Maxwell, who still remained, ( I have yet to thank you for your kindness to my     &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6993-00000015"/> 28        KATE STANTON. brother; but you have not yet told me what was the cause of this accident, as accident I suppose it was." "' I wish--I do most sincerely wish that I could say it was ondly an accident; but of one thing I can confidently assure you, your brother was not to blame, and could not ward off these consequences of what was, I am sorry to say, in plain terms, a drunken brawl." Mr. Maxwell related the circumstances as briefly as possi- ble, blaming Burton no more than was necessary; but that man, being the only one to blame, did not escape without some animadversion. Ahen he concluded, he expressed his surprise, in warm terms, that so gentle a boy in appearance as William, should have been in such a situation. "How happens it, Miss Stanton, that you should allow your brother to seek such an employment for a livelihood?" "Alas, sir! there seem to be few places where a boy of his age can find anything to do, that will at all 'pay the way,' as I may say. We are orphans, and he wished to do his part, though it were a small one, and he is too young for a store." "I think I might find him something more congenial to do, at least something more improving to himself, and by your leave will call again, when he has gained his strength once more." Kate thanked him heartily, and he left the house, promis- ing not to forget his protege. Whether he did, or did not, the sequel will in time show. William's couch was kindly guarded on that troublous night, and a sister's hand soothed the sufferer, as some un-   KATE STANTON.           29  pleasant dream would cause a start, and his frame seemed convulsed as if in sudden pain. It was no new thing for : Kate to watch by the bedside of the sick and ailing; her  ! mother's illness had been an instructive though saddening lesson to her; and now she could avail herself of that expe- rience and practice which alone make perfect, even in the sick-chamber. Who has ever watched through the long, still night, sooth- ing the pillow of suffering humanity, calming the nervous, quieting and cheering the despondent sick, and not felt a growing attachment for the invalid? Who does not feel the kindliest sensibilities awakened at the sight of wretchedness and suffering; and, whether in administering to a diseased mind or a feeble frame and worn-out body, does not feel an inward  yearning to alleviate? "Is it you, dear sister?" said William, as he awoke from an uneasy nap, and seemed collecting his wandering senses. ,Yes, dear brother; how have you slept?"  "I have slept as if there were a heavy weight upon my head, and something seemed pressing me violently down, and as though a band or cord confined me in an unpleasant posture. What do you sit up for?" "I wish to sit up to take care of you. You have had a hard blow, and have lost much blood; you had better lie qui- etly, and pot talk much, for the doctor says your life depends, in a great measure, on your being kept free from excitement. He fears a fever may follow this, and, if it should, you would be in great danger." "But, dear Kate, how long must I lie here? I shall take   &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6993-00000016"/> 30        KATE STANTON. a fever if I have to keep thinking, thinking, and worrying, as to how we are to support ourselves." "But you must not worry, dear William. As to supporting ourselves, we shall not want for fiiends if we do the best we can for ourselves, and Mrs. Maitland will not be hard with us in this instance." "I don't know as to that, Kate; she must live as well as we; and if you cannot pay our board she will not like to wait long; and she must think this a strange beginning." True; but IMr. ilaxwell, who brought you home, has told her all, and that you were not any to blame. I was glad to hear him say so, too; for though I felt that poor dear mother's lessons were not lost upon you, yet I feared, if you thoughlt you were not under restraint, you might forget yourself." "O Kate, how can you say so? you who know how deeply and fondly I loved dear mother, and how I mourn her loss, and how I desire to reverence and respect her memory!" ( I know you do, dear brother; but still you are young, and, perhaps, at times thoughtless, and may not always, when with companions of your own age, and mingling with them in their sports and pastimes, remember that you have at home a / sister who thinks much of you, and is toilinfg for you;--not/ that I mean you do not work yourself, but that I labor in mind as well as in body." "And that is what I want to speak of, Kate. I fear you are working beyond your strength; and even now you are still sewing while you sit up with me. Must you finish that work so soon, that you are obliged to exert yourself so much?" "Yes; I aim making some shirts that must be finished this L     - -----   K ATE STANTON. -; week without fail, as the person they are for, is preparing for a long journey; and while I am sitting up I may just as well be occupied." "Dear Kate, I wish you would just go to bed. I promise you I will be very good, and go to sleep again; at least lie down on the outside here, and try to catch a nap." - ate did as she was urged, and, in spite of her anxiety for her charge, nature would not allow herself to be robbed and imposed upon, so that the sun rose far above the horizon before she again awolke to consciousness. &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6993-00000017"/> CHAPTER      V.

"He looks placid and calm, BMiss Stanton. That iMr. Max- well has been here this morning; but I thought it not best to disturb you, though he seemed anxious and very earnest in his inquiries." "I should like to have seen him, but I thank you for your kindness in not calling me, as I must have been very tired." "You look as if you had watched all night, poor child; but now won't you try to eat something? Breakfast is on the table, and it will do you good.  You can let the chamber door stand ajar, that you may hear your brother should he awake." "Thank you again,  IMrs. Ilaitland; I will come directly," said Kate.   KATE STANTON.           33 Mrs. Maitland was a childless widow, who had seen enough of trial and suffering to know how to sympathize and comfort others; and in her Kate soon learned to find almost a mother. Her tender care and anxious solicitude were quite pleasing to Kate, and she was quite willing to acknowledge it in her words and actions. "Perhaps I ought to say, Mrs. Maitland, that our first month's board is likely by this accident to be somewhat de- layed in payment; but I shall ,try to-?' (You won't try to do anything about it, Miss Stanton; and you need not be bothering your head at all till yopr brother is well again. Don't I know and understand just how it is, and don't I see you would be punctual if possible?" - "But;" began Kate. "There 's no buts in the business. 'But me no bubi,' says- somebody, though I don't know who it was; but he was a wise man though for all that, and a good." "But," again Kate commenced. X ::?: "I say there is no btit.

I am not quite so poor as I seem, because I live all alone.

"But, iMrs. fMaitland, you keep no girl, and you do all your own work. Why do you do so, if you have means to do otherwise?" "I used to keep ' help,' as they are called; but that was years ago, and I had more plague than profit by it, too. It was Bridget here, and Phileen do this, and Bridget do that; and one would not do this, and the other would not do that, and this one wanted her evenings and Sundays, and that one wanted all her beaux here, and such a time they made me! "One help I had, broke the full amount of her wages in some of my best dishes; and, as I did not bargain in the outset, I had her wages to pay besides, and had to support a large Irish family all the time; for, change as often as I would, each and every girl thourght it no sin to carry off sugar, eggs, coffee, tea, - and tea went the most and oftenest,- and other groceries I had laid in. No, I want no help, such as one has to put up with these days." ("But are they all so?" asked Kate. "Pretty much all; I had one good one in about twenty, and she got married after I had her well trained to my ways, and then she went her way, and that was the last I saw of her." ( "Well, you won't object to letting me help you what I can while I am with you," said Kate. "Why, no; as to that you may do as you please; but I am somewhat peculiar, and I have some eccentricities I am sure, and if you were to do anything wrong, I could not blame yMo.

Not to-day, my dear; attend to your brother to-day, and to-morrow I will try you somewhat. At present you must work about him, as he needs you."  "What do you think of his case, Mrs. Maitland?" "Well, Riss Stanton, I am pained to say it looks rather dubersomne. I don't like to say so, but he is kind o' delirious at times, and his skin seems hot and parched. This must be the fever beginning, as the doctor said; but I don't say this to discourage you. It is bad to be a looking on the dark side,  and it may be sinful, too; but my husband-rest his soul!-. died of a fever, and I always have the palpitations when anyr one around me is taken down hard and fast."- Poor Kate! she had indeed worried much on her brother's i account, and such words as these did not make- her feel much : encouraged, as she went back to the chamber, and again seated herself by the bedside of the loved sufferer. William was still sleeping, but an uneasy and restless sleep. He tossed from side to side, and talked to himself often, !- a seeming to be thinking of by-gone scenes of action. His pulse ran high, and a burning heat had taken possession of him; and, as 'Kate sat by him, she hesitated whether or not  to ask Mrs. IMaitland to go for the doctor, when he knocked at the door. Kate rose hastily, and, as she ushered him in, she fixed her eyes upon his face, as if to read there the confirmation of her fears; or to find some encouragement, if possible, in his looks,  as the doctor approached the couch. "It is as I expected," said the doctor; "your dear brother  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6993-00000019"/> 83G6        AA KATE STANTON. has much fever, and the sleep he is now in is doing him but little good. He is apparently working very hard; observe how his brow is knit, and what a firm expression of determination is on his face." "And is that a bad symptom, sir?" "Not exactly a bad symptom; but it shows that the mind is not at ease, and that the body is laboring with a false strength - a strength not its own; and we must wake him, or else he will become too much fatigued." The good doctor gently waked William accordingly; but he was still but little conscious as to where he was. He called for his mother and sister repeatedly; asked what was the matter, and who that man was at his side; why he himself was lying there. "You have been quite ill, my young friend," said the doc- tor, " and, with what we may do for you, we, hope to make you well. What have you been doing in your sleep?" "I have been setting up pins all night, and it seems as if my head was full of blood, and it aches as though it would burst, and I am all out of order. Can't you cure me now? and must I lie here much longer?" "We shall do all we can; but you must have patience a while. In the mean time, I shall give you something to quiet your nerves and relieve your pains. The first thing for you to do is, to get this mind of yours into better working order; so I will just tell you that you are not going to be an alley- boy any longer, but, when you are strong enough, I shall recommend a journey to you. I have seen a friend of yours, this morning, and he will tell you more when he comes to see   KATE STANTON.           37 you, which will be as soon as you are able to see more com- r pany." "And who is this friend, sir?" said William. Il Mr. Maxwell," replied the doctor.  "And who is this Mr. Maxwell?" said Kate. A very excellent young man, Miss Stanton; one who, if you don't watch closely, and keep it well closed, may one day run away with your heart," said the doctor, laughing. ( Do you think there is any danger? replied Kate. O no, my dear girl! He is not at all dangerous; he is per- fectly harmless; but being a clever young man, though per- -/ haps somewhat wild once in a while, he may take' a liking to B you before you know it, some fine morning." Doctor Beach was himself a bachelor, and, though past e sixty, was yet quite young in heart and soul, and loved a good joke; and, like all physicians of the better sort, did not t object to a jolly laugh himself, even in the sick-room. He knew when to be serious, too; but all his patients were fond of him, for he was always cheerful and pleasant, and A knew well how to say something to make their pains appear, for the time at least, to fly away. Dr. Beach, however, never trifled where seriousness seemed most proper; but, even when visiting any one in the closing scenes of life, would assume a cheerful air, which was often i more befitting to such an occasion than a melancholy and i forbidding aspect would be; and many the poor and many the wealthy who hailed his-entrance into their sick-chamber with a heartfelt joy and satisfaction. And the good physician, on his part, gave his whole soul to the work in hand, till it was impossible to believe that a fee 4  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6993-00000020"/> 38        KATE STANTON. had anything to do with any manifestations of sympathy and  solicitude which might be observant in his manner and de- portment. Dr. Beach seldom appeared dejected, either; for, though no relative of the sick, in mistaken kindness, could ever in-  duce him to deceive a patient with the idea he was receiving benefit and final recovery at his hands, when death stood just at hand and ready for his victim; yet he maintained a reso- lute mildness and a gentle bearing, that showed he was un- willing to create unhappiness by a forward desire to make the Great Terror more terrible. On the other hand, Dr. Beach was apt to advise the sick man's friends to tell him truly--when at the last stages of consumption, for instance- that his dissolution was near; that, had he any preparation to make, any arrangements to consider upon, it could be done ere it was too late. Many thanked him for this course; and although tears, bitter tears, and parting regrets followed, yet he gained more friends, for they felt a reliance, a confidence upon his word. Children loved Dr. Beach. He never told them that the medicine was nice when he knew it was not; and how often has the child in simple confidence looked up to him, and in that open, that honest countenance, read volumes of love and heartfelt satisfaction  "Doctor," said Kate, as she followed him out of the cham- ber, "how is my brother?" "He 's sick, Kate." "I know he is, but how sick?  "Well, considerable sick."   KATE STANTON.           89 "Will he recover, or ---- ? "He 'll recover. Did not you see how he changed when I spoke of a journey?" "And what of that?" said Kate. "Why, this, bright-eyes! He has been thinking all night, as he says, about old Barnes' alleys, till he is almost beat out. Again, he has, doubtless, been thinking of returning there on his recovery; but he abhors it, and it needed but a hint to bring him to his senses, and to better feelings. Maxwell has a scheme for him, when he is able to hear about it; so now I'm off, but I must have a  The word sounded like a kiss, but was blundered in its de- livery, as the action was suited to the word, and Kate play- fully boxed his ears. "Pooh, child! I'm old enough to be your grandfather!" and away he went, and away the blushing girl went to com- mune with Mrs. Maitland. Bright and cheerful was Kate Stanton, during the remain- der of the day. A great load seemed lifted off her should- ers, and the words " he will recover" still sounded in her ears, and she thanked her Father in heaven that she had heard them, and placed her trust in Him, that he would give his certain aid. Quiet rest succeeding through the following night, William gained slowly but steadily. Kate worked on, and completed her shirts; and now let us see what was thought of them when they were completed. Let us see whether they suited. But this must be discovered in another chapter.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6993-00000021"/> CHA-PTER VI.

Her name should have been Fuss-well, as she did nothing  , I, h. it^ A1   KATE STANTON.           41 but fuss; and she did fuss well, if anybody ever did that to any degree of perfection. The room in which our lady is presented was furnished in the most elegant and gorgeous style that wealth could com- mand, and thought and mind could contrive. Mr. Fussell, the very opposite to his wife in everything, was a princely merchant on'change; of a liberal mind, and prosperous to a great degre. Successful in business, he had amassed a splendid fortune, and, though time had brought him cares, and many of them, his cheerful and complaisant disposition rose above and pressed down every obstacle that retarded his progress; and now, at the age of seventy years, he could look back upon a life well spent, and forward, when his time should come, to a cheerful change. But IMr. Fussell had no idea of dying at present; far from it. Marrying late in life, his family were still what might be called youthful; for he had two marriageable daughters, that were sought much for by many suitors, but "the right ones," as they said, 4" had not yet shown themselves; " and so they lingered on at home, willing to live and die old maids, if need be, rather than throw themselves away on some courtiers, who might prove but outside show, "Marianne," said Mrs. Fussell, "you are growing very- extravagant. Our means-will not allow of your dressing so much as you do, and in steh style." "Really, mother," said Marianne, " who can say I am ex- travagant, when I am not even on an equality with my sister in dress, or anything else I have?" "Do hear that, now!" said Ellen, the elder of the two: "As if you, Marianne, do not dress as well as I do I am 1 js    ' *   &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6993-00000022"/> 42        KATE STANTON. sure your clothes cost as much as mine; and, if they do not look as well, it is not'the dress-maker's fault. You have an ugly form to fit, and mother always said so." "Iy children," said the mother, " don't quarrel about your forms. I don't want to go into particulars; but I want to see less frivolous expenditures upon you both." "Now, mother, you're hitting us both," said Ellen. "AWell, I must," answered the mother. "And why must you?" said Marianne. "I do it for your good, my daughters. Because we live in a large house, and handsomely furnished, I see no reason why you should add to the necessary expenses of the family." "' And, pray, wife - " "Tife, Mr. Fussell! As though I were a farmer's help- mate," said madam. c"And pray, then, Mrs. Fussell, do let the girls alone. I 'm not afraid of their failing me.

The house is full of odds and ends,- remnants, the dealers call them,-- that you buy because they are cheap. You don't go shopping to get. what you feel you want, and must have; but you go out and look, to see what you will want, and then make up your mind afterwards. Better buy what you want when you want it, and not see what you want to buy. Sister Maxwell could give you good lessons in house-keeping, did you but allow her -"   KATE STAN TON.          48 "Sister Maxwell, indeed!" replied Mrs. Fussell. "She is no pattern of how a lady should conduct. She is forever buying, and is no economist. She is very often buying pins, when a little sealing-wax, carefully placed on the needles she breaks, would suffice, and save many pennies." "Yes, to buy wax with," said Mr. Fussell. "Wax costs more than pins, any day, my dear." "There you are, again!" replied Mrs. Fussell. When I try to be economical, that's all the thanks and all the praise I get." "Well, wife -" "There are you, again, Mr. Fussell!" said she. "Just as if I were an old woman!" "Well, Mrs. Fussell, then, have your way; keep your ideas of economy. Anything for a quiet house!" "Why, sister Maxwell wanted me to get her some shirts done for Charles, as she knew I could get them done cheaper than she can-" "There, now, Mrs. Fussell, don't say a word about grind- ing the poor; for here comes one of that class of unfortunates, and, I think, the shirt-maker, herself." "Yes, it is she, poor girl," said Marianne, looking out of the casement; it and how feeble she seems, too! O, what a hard thing it is to be poor, to be sure!" "You would not think Kate was poor, if you saw her smile of cheerful and contented disposition," said Ellen. "A bet- ter sample of patient endurance under trial have I seldom seen." A gentle ring at the door, and presently Kate's step was heard in the entry.  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6993-00000023"/> "        KATE  STANTON. "(Is Mrs. Fussell at home?" asked our heroine. "She is," said the servant, "but not to you." "And why not to me?" asked Kate. "Tell her I have  brought some work." O, you are to walk in; you 're the shirt-girl! The up- A startings of some folks is horrible!" said the servant, with a semi-pious ejaculation. Kate entered the drawing-room. "I have brought you some shirts, Mrs. Fussell, and I hope they will suit; but, as I have sewed on them late at night, perhaps the work is not quite so even as it should be." "How many are there, miss?" "Three, in all, and the pattern you sent for me to be guided by." ( Yes, I see; but they are not done according to orders. I sent for yoke-necks." "And these are made so, madam, if you please," replied Kate. "4 And so they are; but where are the gussets t Who ever made shirts without gussets, I wonder!" "(They are just like the pattern you sent me, and I have followed that strictly, except in one instance." And how have you dared to alter from that, miss, in your one instance?"                      i "I do not presume to dictate; but the pattern you sent could never have fitted very snugly; for whoever made it seems to have forgotten that the human neck is exactly in the middle, from each shoulder; and, as this is not so, I cut by a saucer; and, if you measure, you will find they will draw to a line." ,-   KATE  STANTON.         45 "Well said, miss," said Mr. Fussell, who was an eager listener; "though I never thought of that before." "' And what do you expect to receive for these, miss?" said madam. "Three dollars for the three," said Kate, modestly. "Three dollars! I can never give it in the world! Fifty cents each is fully enough, I am sure; and that is good pay for anybody." "Would you do them for that?" asked Kate, respectfully, but firmly. "Why, why- I don't know as I would; but if I were in your line of trade, I think I should, for such work." "The work is good, and will bear examination., Observe, it is hem-stitched, bosoms and wrist-bands; and a dollar each is not great pay for such as these," replied Kate. "Great or not great, I cannot give it; and fifty cents is a plenty, these times," said Mrs. Fussell. "Ah, these times, indeed!" replied Kate. "When every- thing is high and expensive, sure a hard-toiling sewing-girl should have her price, too; and that cannot be high." "Well, that's as you please, miss; it's all I 'll give, and that I cannot give to-day. You may leave the shirts, and call again in a few days, if you like." Poor Kate left the room, silent and sad. Her heart was full, and her eyes, if possible, fuller. As she turned into the passage, she became aware of some one following her; and, just as she reached the hall-door, to leave the mansion, a hand was gently laid upon her shoulder, which caused her to turn her head, when she encountered the cheerful face of Mr. Fussell.  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6993-00000024"/> "        KATE STANTON. "Come, miss, don't be cast down. It's my wife's way; she's always preaching economy to the girls; andthank my stars, I am able to pay such as you fair prices for their labor, and no grumbling. Put that in your pocket," said he, giving her a five-dollar bill. ," But say nothing to my wife of this,  though I am sorry." Kate gratefully pressed his hand; she could not speak her thanks, but one look was sufficient to show all she felt. "A little word in kindness spoken, A motion or a tear, lHas often healed the heart that's broken, Andt made a friend sincere." Her thoughts were everywhere. Her throat swelled with indescribable emotions, as she walked along the streets towards her home; and,- as she mused upon the actions of the past half hour, she sighed repeatedly, and wondered much what use there is in being rich. ( O," thought she to herself, " if riches close the purse- strings, close up all avenues to active and well-timed benev- olence, and lead their votaries even to rob and distress the poor, what is it good for to be rich " Ah, young girl, all are not so! Mr. Fussell, whom you have just parted from, is an exception, and there are many in this city who are other exceptions. Mr. Fussell is a real merchant; not of the drizzling, low-begetting, truth-forsaking sort; but who, with his partner and brother-in-law, Mr. Maxwell, father to Charles, are men of principle, and strict devotion to right, from motives of right,- the beau ideal of pure and upright dealing.                             ] ,   KATE STANTON.           47 They were partners in trade, and fond of each other, and  roud of each other's integrity and manliness. Their course f action may be sneered at by many who think that the buyer  iould have a hundred eyes, and if the seller can cheat the  hole hundred, he is praiseworthy, and deserving to grow       i i worldly grace; but yet they were men who cared nothing ,r the opinions of such, but kept the "even tenor of their Mrs. Maxwell, the sister of Mr. Fussell, was a model in1 wrself; of an open and generous temperament, though fond 'dress and show, 'as ladies are apt to be; yet, kept her ace in society more by unostentation than needless display, id, though economical, was not mean nor niggardly. In the Fair of the shirts, Mrs. Fussell had told her that she eam- oyed a young, but active girl to sew for her; but she had t told her that she would work for but half price, or Mrs. axwell would never have engaged at such terms.  Her son Charles wasabout starting on a tour through the uth and West, and she wished to have his wardrobe some- iat replenished, as his stay might be of a protracted na- 'e..                  .  His sister Sarah had done all she could; but, being not quite  irteen years of age, her usefulness was somewhat restricted, i part of the arrangements must therefore necessarily be rformed by strangers. Charles had never been from home, though somewhat passed nty-one, the age when men reallyfeel oldest and most ex-  'ienced. And now a mother's heart yearned for him, as he about leaving the, roof of his childhood and- youth, to igle with, and combat the varied world.,  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6993-00000025"/> 48         KATE  STANTON. She had few fears for him; for, though inclined to be wild, he was a youth of well-instilled good principles, that she felt  she had aided to inculcate and infuse; yet all mothers are anxious, and Mrs. Maxwell was one of that blessed number. His health had not been very firm for some time past, from perhaps somewhat of over-exertion in the counting-room of   his father and uncle. They were strict disciplinarians, though intentionally kind to their clerks and employes; yet, in a very busy season, when trade was brisk, they were liable to heavy days, and laborious ones. And, perhaps, this wildness already mentioned, something, a shade perhaps, on the borders of dissipation, may have done its part towards sowing the seeds of ill health and disease. And now it was thought best by both father and uncle that Charles should travel a little, particularly for his health; but that it might not be put to a wrong or careless use, they thought best that it should be a tour uniting business with pleasure. They therefore agreed that he should start upon a " collect- ing circuit" in the cities and towns of the fr West; and, fixing his head-quarters in Nashville, Tennessee, he might scour the country round about, and drum up the delinquent cus- tomers. They did not care to have him, at present,  "Forced to drudge for the dregs of men, And scrawl strange words with the barbarous pen ;" But chose he should join the varied crowd, Where the sons of trade are busy and loud!  - ,S a   KATE STANTON.          49 At Charles' earnest solicitation, it was determined that young Stanton should be invited to accompany him, as soon as his strength would permit him to leave home; and this was the scheme which Dr. Beach had in view, when he changed the suffering boy into a hopeful and grateful one. As Kate was returning from Mrs. Fussell's, whom should she meet but Charles Maxwell, who very gallantly offered to escort her homewards, as the gray dusk of evening was fast approaching; and she not unwillingly accepted his kindly proffered attention. "I am very glad to meet you," said Charles Maxwell, as they walked along; "' but I wish to inform you of my father's plan, and as regards your brother especially. He has de- cided I should do the collecting this season, and I have asked and obtained leave to invite your brother to go with me and aid me in my labors." "O, Mr. Malxwell!" said Kate, you are doing too much for us when you say so; but I cannot interfere in anything that will undoubtedly be for my brother's well-being. But to what are we indebted for this kindness?" "To nothing, and to no one, Miss Stanton. The matter is mutual. I want a young assistant to aid me in my writing and accounts, and your brother wants health and strength, as also do I; so we are even, and no obligation felt at all." "As to that," said Kate, c" the balance of benefit is with him, and the profit; while yours is the expense and trouble. I don't think I can consent to his going; I don't like the terms.". "If I am satisfied, and my father, why should you care? I want a companion, and neither of us has ever been abroad 5  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6993-00000026"/> 50        KATE STANTO N. much.  I can make him sufficiently useful to me to compenr sate entirely for all expenditure for his journey; and should I wish to return first, I can place him somewhere, where he can obtain much good, as well as pleasure and gratification." O, Mr. Maxwell! you are too generous; but I thank you heartily. I trust I have my brother's good too much at heart,  to refuse him any real benefit that can possibly accrue to him, and I do therefore consent to parting with him, though it be, as it is, I think, from the only blood relative I have in the wide world!" ( Thanks, Miss Stanton, thanks! for I feel it is conferring a favor upon me, especially, to have him with me. There is something in his face that seems to draw me to him almost irresistibly; and, if I can do him no good, I trust I may do him no harm." "I cannot help being grateful to you, Mr. Maxwell, for your kindness to him on that eventful evening on which our acquaintance so strangely commenced; and, if I could show my gratitude in any reasonable way, I should be almost too happy." "( Say no more, Miss Stanton; we are quits. I am pleased with the boy, and my father, whom, I hope, you may one day see, approves of my course, and is willing to take my word for it that your brother is all I tell him that he is. But here we are, at your door, where you can dispense with my services. Get your brother well and strong as possible, and as soon as Dr. Beach may say the word, we will be off to the far West." x, ,1   /; CHAPTER VII.

DAYS rolled on, and Kate, still quiet, thoughtful, and de-  1l bative, ran over in her mind what she should do, as. she resolved herself into a ," committee of ways and means," to- wards providing suitable apparel for her brother William. It was necessary to repair and replenish his wardrobe, to brighten up everything that needed brightening, and to make him as comfortable as possible in his absence. And it was a hard task for a young girl just blooming into womanhood, - for girls are women at sixteen,-- to have a great boy of a brother to arrange and provide for; to see to his wants, to mend his stockings, repair his shirts, and,- what most men make a fuss about, keep his collars in order and in good condition. William was not above wearing patched clothes; but all these things came under a sister's eye. And Ms. Maitland was ready to give her advice when needed, though she was    i not one of those who advise unsolicited and unasked, saying, "That 's my advice; follow it or not, as you please."  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6993-00000027"/> I2        K ATE STANTON. William was much pleased with the prospect of a journey, nd already began to plan for himself as to what he meant o do; but Kate reminded him that for the present he must :onsider himself in the employ of Mr. Maxwell, and must iave no plans of his own.  He had never been from home, and now, to leave his own nd only sister pained him, while it pleased him to think he vas going abroad in the world; so, with a mixed feeling of oy and sadness, he saw the various preparations that were naking for his departure, and his separation from the only Leing endeared to him. "O , Kate," said William, one day, "I hope you don't think do wrong in wishing to go, to leave you so lonely! I feel as hough I ought not to go, and yet-" "Give yourself no uneasiness, William. It is certainly test you should go; as, at your age, it will undoubtedly do rou great good, and may be the means of getting you into ome business that will be beneficial and profitable." "But what will you do, Kate, while I am away?" said William, anxiously. "O, I am not afraid but that I shall do well enough! Of ,ourse I must give up one of these rooms; it is not worth vhile to be paying for your room, and you not here to occupy t. Mrs. Maitland says she can let it; and all the furniture [ care about can be moved into my room. This will lessen )ur expenses considerably." "Thoughtful girl, that you always are, dear Kate! But, shan't you be very lonesome?  "Of course I shall; but I ought to learn that part, and let it form a part of my trade,- my stock in trade,- and set up ' ? '**   KATE  STANTON.         53 a store with a stock of goods; and the best goods in the store shall be patience and perseverance, and the poorest goods shall be those virtues I need the least; yet I must not sell patience, but keep it on hand, to lend." "I wish I could stand behind your counter, too," said Wil- liam, " and be a partner." "Why, what would you sell?" "I would sell all I ought not to keep - unkindness, mean- ness, and hypocrisy," replied William. "You have not any stock of them on hand," said Kate, laughing, ,"so you would have to assue hem merely. hat would be objected to by the female partner, on the ground of obtaining goods under false pretences, master William!" "dWell," said William, "seriously, what do you think of doing? '"Whatever I can," said Kate, so I do nothingmy dear brother would disapprove of, were he by to see me. Mrs. Mait- land is one of the old school; and she says I can succeed if I will; and if I have a will, she will find the way." "You must write me at Nashville, Kate, and keep me well informed of all that happens here. I suspect you will make a conquest pf some kind or other while I. am away. If Dr. Beach was a little younger, and his hair a shade darker, I don't know what name I might have to call you by on my return; but he is a dear good man, and has been almost a -father to me this winter,- he would make too old a brother." "Pie, William! for shame!" said Kate. The mantling blush would come, however, in spite of his saying, that day that the loud report was heard in the entry, he was old enough to be her grandfather! 5*  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6993-00000028"/> 54        KATE STANTON. Dr. Beach had been very assiduous in his attention, and had won both their hearts; so, had he wished to marry Kate, he would have had to take her brother also; which might possibly have been somewhat objectionable, to say the least. Physicians of this class are always favorites, even when asso-  ciated with hours of pain, and sleepless nights of torture and disease. "But what am I to do for clothes, Kate? I must have a supply of something or other, if I am to be away any length of time; and I must look decent, if I am to figure among Mr. Maxwell's customers." "True, William, I have not forgotten that, I assure you; and I am much troubled, to be sure. I don't like to rob the old chest; but I see no other way, at present, and in our necessity." A venerable box or chest, of somewhat ample dimensions, and a fitting companion to the old chair and table already mentioned, filled one corner of the apartment; and to this the young folks now hastened. This chest had been a sort of heir-loom in the family, the omniuZin yatherum for useful articles,- not, however, thrown in, indiscriminately, as the words might imply; but containing the cast-off garments, besides such bedding and household gear, not always in wear, that hlad found a convenient storage  there, away from dust, and carefully protected fromn the moth. To this old receptacle, then, the children repaired; and, carefully removing each article, as though sacred to the touch, they searched among the relics of former years, if, haply, they might find something which, by dint of thread and needle, might be made serviceable in this emergency. -I   KATE STANTON.           55 "O O, William, how our dear mother used to venerate and respect these things! There 's a quilt, every stitch of which was worked by her grandmother;- there was no slop-work in those days, if this be a fair specimen;- and here is another, with a border of flowers, that mother never would let any one touch but herself; see how nicely it is folded!" , "Ah, Kate, it does seem almost sacrilege to look at them, now; but necessity knows little of forbidden things. What's here?" This question was caused by observing one neatly-packed bundle, scented with a mixture of tobacco and camphor, scru- pulously arranged, so as not to come in immediate contact with the article protected, but stillto afford security from the house- hold pest It proved to be a coat of Mr. Stanton's, which he had' left behind him when he went away, and which his wife had faith- fully kept for him, in ease he should ever return; and year after year it had been kept, with, if it might be so termed, a maternal fondness. "O, William, how mother cherished that coat! I can, in fancy, see her now, as every spring she took it down from the clothes-press, where it always hung all winter long; and how she brushed it so carefully, then shook it gently, then smoothed the velvet collar, and, as the little particles of dust seemed to settle on it, would take a handkerchief and cover over it carefully, hang it up again, then take it down again, and . brush it gently, as though she feared she should hurt it! And then how she sighed, and sometimes would turn her head aside! I knew it was to hide a tear, for I used to hear her sob quite audibly."  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6993-00000029"/> 56        R AATE STANTON. "Yes, Kate; and when I asked her why she prized it so highly, she would faintly smile on me, and say it reminded her of other and better days; and I think she said it was father's weddilng coat." "Well, old tricnln, you must now be remodelled, and made over; no lonel r can you he suffered to wait for one who may never return hlome to claim you." , Remodelled, indeed!" said W\illiaml. "I wish it were possible to wear it as it is; but how odd it looks! Such a collar -larec enough to make two of, as they manufacture coats now-a-days; and O, so short-waisted! Could it have ever been in fashion? And such sleeves! large enough to put my two arms into each of them; and yet mother said father was not a large man." "It is a good fault, though, William; there 's cloth enough, otherwise there would be no use in our trying to do anything to it at all. It is a lucky prize, now. I do hate to cut it up, though." "Yes," said William; "it seems like cutting one's own heart-strings to remove these old associations, so hallowed and so dear; but there is no help for it; so lay that aside to begin with." "What next?" said Kate. "Here's another bundle, somewhat smaller. Why, it's a pair of unmentioZables ; but they must be mentionable, now, for they are just the sort for me. You can tack them up, and shorten them." "I suppose I must, dear brother; but the how is the ques- tiqn. It's a different thing, making boys' clothesrom the ordinary mantua-making trade I have followed, of late; but   K A T E S A N T O N.       57 necessity taught me that, and I suppose Madam Necessity can teach me further,- for it is out of the question to hire with our means." ( Don't think of it, Kate; don't think of it. Never say die! I never saw you undertake anything, yet, that you did not carry through in some shape or other." "Thank you, brother! It's well you have a fair opinion of your sister, at all events. It is a good trait, come what will. I wish we need not be separated; but I know I cannot always expect to keep you by my side, and I ought not to want to do so, now, if it is for your good that you do go away." "When is Mr. Maxwell going, Kate?" asked William, "In about a week, he says," said Kate. ( He is only wait- ing till you are strong enough to bear the fatigue of the jour- ney; and as there is some stage-riding to undergo, he thought your head, not yet quite steady, was not equal to the work required." "I wish the cars or steamboats went all the way," said William. "What do you care, William, how you go?  You don't know which you may like best." ' But they say that the cars are the only fit conveyances, now-a-days. I wonder if I should be afraid to ride in them." "I don't think there is much danger," said Kate. "You  know I went out to M-  in the cars, last month, and I only trembled a little when they started, and the locomotive made such a -noise." "Yes; this new invention is a noisy contrivance, and rather hard to manage, I should say. When I went to Portland, the other day, I wondered whether the motion of the great steam  -  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6993-00000030"/> 58        KATE STANTON. pump was the same in the land engine; and I asked some one who was winding up a wheel, and somebody else called out to me, 'No talking to the man at the helium! '- and I went away, though I should like to know what the hellum was. It seemed really rather warm around where the man was, and he was all in a glow, as he kept turning and twisting those great spokes!" "That was what they call the wheel-house," said Kate. "But where was the helium? It was much hotter down below, where the men were packing in the wood into the great furnaces." O, the helm, William! I understand you, now; that was the helmsman. le is to guide the rudder, which is at- tached to ropes that pass under the wheel he was turning around." "Ah, I understand it, now; but he need not have been so plaguy cross about it, though!" ' Well, perhaps not; but they have rules, on those boats, that are not to be infringed upon." "Here comes Dr. Beach! Now, look out, Kate, or he will carry you off!" said William. "H( ush, William! don't -" "Well, young folks," said the doctor, coming in, " how are you all? And what are you about, with all this clutter?  Not going to be married, are you, Kate? One would think so, eh! What are you doing with all these clothes? Ah, yes, yes, I see! fixing off the boy. That 's right, that 's right; and how is he, to-day?" "Right well; and right glad to see you, sir," said William. "Ah! right well, eh! So you think you have done with   RATE  STANTON.         59 drugs and doctor's stuffs, and would turn the old man adrift again, if possible." "Why, not exactly adrift, doctor; you don't get the drift of my feelings, sir;- I am pleased that I am about recovered, but not with the thought of losing your acquaintance." "No fear of that, no fear of that, young man; for, 'E'en dismissing the doctor don't always succeed. He will stick by, sometimes, like a sheep-tick. But it's my way, my way, boy! I am glad to see you so comfortable. So you are bound to leave us, are you? Well, if you want any worldly advice, I can give you some, as the professional is not needed. You are going out into the world, and must have your eye-teeth cut; you'll want them before youget through! I know the world; and, like yourself, I was not born with a gold spoon in my mouth; no, far from it,- about as far as you can go. Let me see-let me see-no-yes- yes, it must have been -well, no matter; but my parents were poor, and I had to scratch for a living; and I got along after a fashion; but a doctor's life is a gloomy one." "Why did you choose it?" said Kate. "Well, I didn't choose it; I rather tumbled into it, I was a farmer's boy at fifteen, and somebody in the neighbor- hood was sick that I used to sit up with and take care of; and I loved him, was attached to him, and got such a nursing spell upon me, that I took to the trade sort o' natural like. So I studied when I could, and worked when I couldn't study; and, by working late and rising early, I was, after a long while, able to earn enough to study physic as a profes- sion; and it has taken to me, or I have taken to it, just as you please.

"Well, you are young yet, sir," said William. "Boy!" said the doctor, vainly endeavoring to appear serious. ( Boy, I 'in past sixty "  "Sixty!" exclaimed both the children at once. "Is it possible?" "I guess you will think it possible, when you have been through all I have; but I 'm keeping you idle, so good-by, and a pleasant journey to you." "Doctor," said William, following him into the entry, "I want to see you once more before I go away. You will not be disturbed by my calling on you, at your office, even if I  do not come professionally. I have something to say to you." "Not in the least, not at all, my boy; come once, or as often as you please, and bring your sister with you."  "INbt this time, sir. This time I want to see you alone."  "Very well, William, when shall it be?" "To-morrow, sir, if you please," said he.  "If you please, my boy, and I am always at home, that is, when lam not out." "What a queer man Dr. Beach is, to be sure, Kate!" said ,*   KATE  STANTON.          61 William. "What a father he would make us! I wonder he never married." "He was disappointed in love, when a youth, I understand, and never tried again." "See what it is to be constant to one's first love! How un- like the men in this respect!" "What do you know about man's love, sister? Were you ever in a position to know about any one in the matter of love?" asked William, laughingly. "Not yet, I hope," said Kate. "Then don't judge too hastily. I don't believe all men are inconsistent because father went away." "O, don't mention him so!" said Kate. "Something seems to whisper to me that we may yet see him again, and that perhaps soon." "Not in this world, Kate. Don't think it, or he would have come back before this time." "We don't know. that, William; you remember I    am always hoping; 'Hope on, hope ever' is my motto; and 'Strive and thrive' must be yours." 6   &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6993-00000032"/> r CHAPTER VIII.

To-3IOmnOW came, - no, it did n't, to-morrow never came; well, suit yourself, reader, to-morrow did n't come, but some- thing called to-morrow came,- and found William, who had walked out for the first time since his accident, quietly and comfortably seated in Dr. Beach's office. A bright coal-fire was glowing in an ample grate; for, though spring had come, it had not brought with it the " ethe-  ! real mildness" that the poet Thomson wrote about; and a  fire was yet quite acceptable. The room, or office, was a basement story of a brick house,  pleasantly situated in the north part of the city, and not far from Mrs. Maitland's. The room was beautifully furnished, and an air of scru- pulous neatness pervaded the apartment.   KATE  STANTON.          63 The furniture was massive and strong, bearing certain evi- dence of having been made in honest times, when the maker was honestly paid for honest work, and when work brought its price, according to its style and finish. The old easy-chair, which now held the centre of the room, seemed an easy-chair indeed,- a real bachelor chair, a right- down comfort, - and so our William found it. The wall was hung with a few family portraits, and on neat brackets, around the sides of the room, were placed busts, said to be good likenesses of St. Luke and Galen,- for St. Luke himself was a physician of the body as well as of the soul. Nor were these all, for Messrs. Gall and Spurzheim had their places also. Besides all these, some well-filled shelves of much-worn and solid-looking volumes, gave token that the doctor was by no means an idle man, nor a slothful; and, to show also that he was a man of taste, and a gentleman of some sense, and fond of literature, a much-thumbed volume of Shakspeare lay upon the table. William had ample time to observe all these things while waiting the doctor's return from his round of visits; and he saw nothing to cause him to think otherwise than that this same doctor was a very agreeable man, and a first-rate friend, if he should continue to keep his right side. But William thought there were evident signs that this room was not only occupied by his friend, the doctor, but that some one of the gentle sex resorted thither, as he espied a work-basket on a side-bord, filled with nothing that the doctor could have used. "Why, he certainly is not married!" he soliloquized; " and yet this apartment is too neat for a bachelor --" Hark!  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6993-00000033"/> "        KATE  STANTON. the door discovers, on its opening, a tall and comely matron, clad simply, but with taste,--her dress rather short, and a black silk apron, with black open-work pockets, in one of which is displayed a bunch of house-keys. Ah! she is the doctor's sister, and a spinster of course. Observe how she pokes the fire. A sure sign, is it not? o And there, too! see what a likeness, a very duplicate of herself, from head to foot, though she certainly wears false hair,- shame on her! why don't she let the gray be seen?- and is rather more sallow-looking, owing to close confinement, and too great thought. She looks kind and benevolent in her way. Wonder if she and the doctor live peaceably here; for she looks somewhat stern, with all her kindness. O, that's her way, depend upon it! It does not signify; she is all right; and so the doctor thought. What need had he of a wife, who might not prove a help-mate after all?                    ! "And so you are the lad that got almost killed with the  broken glass, I reckon; a'n't you?" asked Miss Nancy Beach, the doctor's sister, and of age uncertain.           i "I am the boy that was somewhat injured," said William;  "but I am better now, and have become strong enough to     I make my first airing suffice to call on the doctor here. I am  sorry he is out." "He will be in quite soon.  There's lots of sick this  spring, and he's much hurried from morning till night.  There 's a sort of epidemic going about, that, though not often fatal, is rather contagious, though he don't say much about it to me; he thinks I am anxious, and so I am."   KATE STANTON.           65 "And so you are, Nancy," said the doctor entering: "A real fidget; and I don't dare to speak much to you, lest you may think I have brought the fever home with me, and show it in my speech and language." "God forbid!" said Nancy, shuddering and turning pale. And so say 1, Nancy; but I am not afraid of it, and you ought not to be. There is little danger if taken hold of in season. The neglected cases are those that are most fatal or dangerous. Why, I thought William here was going to have it after his wound; but with care and attention he has escaped, I think. Eh, William?" "But you thought I had a hard time of it, sir?" "And so you did; but your accident caused it, and not the contagious feature that I dreaded when I saw you the second time." "Doctor, I have come, according to appointment yesterday, to have a little talk with you; and am ready to speak, if you are ready to hear. " Miss Nancy left the room on hearing those words, and William resumed. "That I am going away is now certain. You have pro-; nounced me well enough; and nothing remains, but the fin- ishing of what little preparation I have to make, and then I am to take my leave. But one thing does trouble me. I have learned to look upon you as a friend, and into your ear I wish to pour my distresses." "Pour away, then, my boy; I am all attention." "I have a sister - " "I know you have. So have I  " ' She's young--" 6  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6993-00000034"/> "        KATE  STANTON. "So 's mine, I was going to say, but --" "She will be lonesome, and will hardly know what to do; and I am afraid she may be imposed upon, and come to harm; for, though older than I am, yet I feel I am her senior in in most things, and, though but fifteen years of age, bereave- ment has in some sort made a man of me, though I cannot tell exactly how. I feel older than I did a year ago, by many ' years; and it seems as if I were a sort of guardian over her." "And so you are, so you are, my thoughtful friend; and  you want me to take a look after her. Say it, why don't you?"  "I do, but-" "But what, my boy?- you don't know what to think about asking a young bachelor like me, eh?" 4"I know you are willing to do what you can for her, but- "But again! I understand your feelings; but my sister  will help me, and we will constitute ourselves her guardians, if she will let us.' "Yes; but I don't want her to know I have applied to you, and hence this secrecy on my part." ( Leave it to us, my boy, and rest assured all shall be well; and we will bring Mrs. Maitland to our side also. And she thinks everything of your sister, and, as to that, of you too," said the doctor, "I shall incur a large bill for favors done, as well as for  professional services rendered," said William.        : "Say not a word; they are both paid, and fully paid. I   i am a free-mason, and willing to bestow my mite occasionally; and this is one of those oceasions," replied the doctor,   KATE STANTON.           67 "O, you are too kind!" said William. "I have not mer- ited such indulgence, and shall insist on your receiving your full fees." "Young man, when I started in life, and opened this house and office, I made one rule with myself, which I am proud I am able to say I have not deviated from; and that was this (now listen to what I am going to say to you), out of each year's patients, to select one, at least, on whom I would bestow my advice and treatment free of cost, and see whether in the end I should lose by it. I am thankful to say I have been a large gainer, not only pecuniarily so, but in every sense. I began this year with you; you were the first new patient with the new year, and you are not likely to prove an exception to other of my patrons. "No - no thanks," continued he, seeing William about to speak. "I only think this to be my duty, and I am fully paid." "But will Kate be satisfied?" ' She must be; she cannot be otherwise than willing, when she knows my rule. Go home now to her, as I must make some calls that I found waiting on my slate to be attended to." "What on earth did you let that lad come here for, Ezra, eh?" said Miss Nancy, as William retired. "And, why not, Nancy?   That boy has won my heart with his gentleness, and implicit confidence and trust; and I like him." "That may all be; but we shall catch the fever, if every youngster that has had the symptoms, is perfectly free to come here, and contaminate this salubrious air, so redolent with the perfumes of knowledge."  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6993-00000035"/> 68        KATE STANTON. "'0, Nancy! for shame! Think what we were at his age; and he seems just as we were then, and his sister, too, just what you were then,- only, though I say it myself, much more fair to behold, even, than she is." "( Ah, Ezra, you always did delight to draw your mnemoni- cal interpretations of the becomingness of my fair and agile proportions; but, if I can always maintain my gynecocracy in your presence; it will continue to avail me much." ," Why, Nancy, what's the matter? You certainly want cupping! Let me draw a mnemonical interpretation on your arm, lest you faint!" "No, brother. 'Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed;' and I opine that the seemingly occult phrase belongeth in a measure to the other sex as well." i"Well, as you will, Nancy; but now tell me what can you aid me in doing for this young lad's sister? lie is about to travel; and she will be left alone, and must be provided for. He is my protcg6; oblige me by taking her under your wing." "Has she had the fever, too?" "No, nor is she likely to have it." "Then, what shall I do, at so intempestive a period, to intermediate among you?" "I tell you, Nancy, there is no fear of the fever. Come, sister,- you, a doctor's sister, and afraid of contamination! Where is your fortitude? Be yourself; and don't make me a woman, while I need all the energies of a man!" "Well, brother, I will try to ameliorate the condition of your friends; but don't have them coming here to take share and share with me." "Come, come, Nancy; remember our own childhood--the   KATE  STANTON.          69 old homestead; how we, as poor children, used to totter down ;j  the road, hand in hand; how we have grown together, been nurtured on the same tree, fostered by the same hand ;--and shall we not go hand in hand, as we used to do; and shall we not aid others, as we were ourselves aided? Shall this poor girl be less cared for than you were at her age? I have not said she is to come here; but I want to devise some plan with you, to keep her afloat till her brother returns to his own again." "Why perambulates he away from the vicinage of his home and his kindred?" "His health requires it, and his duty demands it, for a season." "I will turn me over in the hidden recesses of my pericra- cranium's inmost depths,- in modern parlance, my brain,- and see what occult material I can bring to the upper surface, that shall aid thee in this affair." "Thanks, Nancy, for your condescension thus far; and, when you have arrived at some feasible conclusion, we will commune together. Now, I must be off ohce more." Miss Nancy Beach, the doctor's sister, was no fool, though her much-jumbled words gave certain indications of an es- tranged or eccentric mind; yet she could talk sensibly when she chose, and, knowing this, her brother seldom checked her when riding her hobby. He well knew he had but to pro- pose any arrangement, to have it accomplished; and, though a woman of many words, and a perfect Eve-like curiosity- seeker, she could come down from her high horse, and con- verse as sensibly and rationally as most folks, when it suited ':' her to do so. ', i '  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6993-00000036"/> 70        IATE  STANTON. Her brother left her, therefore, well knowing that when next thay conversed, she would have some arranged plan for Kate Stanton's benefit; and could carry out, with a fixed deter- mination and hearty zeal, any arrangement that might be undertaken. "Ezra has taken a strange liking to this Kate Stanton. I wonder what there is i n her appearance so exaltingly captivat- ing! That's just the way; he seeks the young and the gay; and poor old homely me, if I only keep his habitation in order, and free from speck of dust or dirt, it is all I am fit for, I suppose!" Miss Nancy seemed to forget that she owed every pleasure in life to this same medical brother. He had brought her up, from early childhood, upon his own hard earnings, and she knew it; and, though she often complained of him, unthink- ingly, yet their differences were but "April showers,"- they always brought May flowers. Few there were more ready to aid the suffering poor, few more willing to comfort the afflicted, visit the sick, and admin- ister to the distressed, than was Miss Nancy; but she did not like that any one else should originate a plan or a'device. She wanted the credit of doing herself what she did; and to feel that she was the designer of the multitude of good deeds and benefits that her brother led her to perform. Thus it was that she was not willing at once to enter upon any arrangement for Kate; but, as the doctor left her to think it over, and reflect upon it by herself, and alone,- why, of course, she gradually relented, and was quite zealous to be the means of making her comfortable and happy. Many were the thoughts that suggested themselves to her   R ATE STANTON.          71 mind, as to what was the best course to pursue; now, whether Kate should reside with them, and go from time to time to see Mrs. Maitland; now, whether she had not better stay where she was, and be left to consider herself independent, but to have a pair of guardians, to whom she could come if she saw fit. Miss Nancy finally determined that Kate was to know nothing of any agreement that William had made for her; but that they were only to have an eye to her interests, in case she was found needing such; and, further remembering that they had no power over her, otherwise than such power as Kate chose should be exerted, she thought it proper to remain aloof from any immediate contact with her. Thus, then, she told the doctor, on his return to his office, that she thought Kate would do well enough where she was; and much better, perhaps, if she remained ignorant that she had any such friends, as she would be obliged to rely upon her own exertions, while she felt that on herself alone rested her means of living. ' The doctor coincided with his sister in her reasoning, and it was finally determined " to see from a distance only" that Miss Stanton was comfortable; and to make a confidant of Mrs. Maitland, when occasion should ever require any more immediate attention ;-- thus leaving Kate free in independence of thought and purpose, but, like the parent bird, when teach- ing its young the first principles or rudiments in the art of flying, to spread a friendly wing near by, to shelter in case of falling, and to uphold should danger or difficulty approach. Thus things went on with our friends; the young Stantons busied in preparing for Williamn' departure, Kate making H -     *    -   &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6993-00000037"/> 72        KATE STANTON. every arrangement for his welfare that affection and sisterly devotion could suggest might be needed, and her slender means could supply; and, with the Maxwells, similar matters were discussed and debated upon. Mrs. Maxwell again and again reiterated her most solemn charges to her son Charles, to remember himself, his position and standing in society, and the responsibility he was about to assume in the charge of his young friend; and, although wealth, on their side, contributed everything for Charles' comfort, yet Kate, in her poverty, was by no means behind in making her brother comfortable and easy. Charles' sister Sarah assumed every preparation that her youthful fingers were competent to perform; and William's sister, aided by Mrs. Maitland, completed his wardrobe to his satisfaction. Busy fingers in both houses had been hard at work; and the day was now rapidly approaching when every- thing was to be at an end. "Shall we not see your young friend before you go?" said Sarah Maxwell to her brother. "If you desire it, and mother is willing, I will bring him here to-morrow," said Charles. "O, do, by all means!" said his mother. "I should like very much to see him; and if you can prevail upon his sister, you talk so much about, please invite her, too, in my name." "O, let them come to-morrow to tea!" said Sarah. ("Do so, my son," said Mrs. Maxwell; " it will be doing them a service, and the lad will hardly feel at home here un- less she is by." c"And then, too," said Sarah, "his sister will want him with her, all she can, during the remainder of the week; so do insist upon their both coming to-morrow."   it.     IKATE STANTON.           73 "I am glad you feel for her, my daughter. Cherish those sentiments of sympathy; they are creditable in a woman, and are part and parcel with the graces which most adorn and beautify the sex." "What makes you blush so, Charles?" said his sister. t    " "Am I blushing, Sarah?" "Ask mother, Charles." "You are, Charles, most decidedly," said his mother. "Well, the room is very warm, and the air feels close," replied Charles. "I feel sure it will seem warmer to-morrow afternoon!" said Sarah, archly. "Why will it?" said her brother. "Don't you know that to-morrow is one day nearer sum- mer?" replied his sister, laughing. "Look out, Sarah! My friend William is about your age, and rather handsome -the brightest eyes and blackest hair that ever you met with!" "And what is that to me?" said Sarah. "Nous verrons, ma chere soeur!" responded Charles. The morrow came, and with it the afternoon; and, with that, the visit of our youthful friends, the Stantons. Mrs. Maxwell welcomed them both with open arms, and upon Kate's bright cheek impressed a kiss of encouragement; and each member of her pleasant household vied with each other which should do most towards making the young stran- gers perfectly at ease. Kate appeared well in company, as she did everywhere; and now she particularly made manifest that her education had not been neglected, but that those nicer traits of polite ?,          7 "I -'.  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6993-00000038"/> 74        EKATTE STANTON. society were plainly visible in her dignified deportment and easy demeanor. She was " at home " immediately; and Sarah Maxwell rejoiced that she, too, had found a friend, and, she trusted, a companion.        Her mother ad been Sarah had few intimate companions. er mother had been urgent that she should have a select few; and those few were such only as a mother would be sure to approve of. After the frst few civilities, usual upon entering, had been attended to, Sarah led the way to a beautiful garden in the rear of the house; and, considering it was only such as the limits of a Boston yard could afford, was well stocked with many choice and elegant flowers. The "lily of the valley " was there, so spotless and so pale; and the violet, the wild rose, and the moss, both white and red, though not yet in flower; the , Laburnum, rich in streaming gold;" the mezereon, the yellow broom, and, , Luxuriant above all, The jasmine, throwing wide her elegant sweets;" while the modest myrtle and the honeysuckle had each a place; and many other beautiful specimens, which Sarah as- iured them were planted and nurtured by herself,- though few of these were yet in blossom. "t And you are fond of flowers, are you not, Miss Stanton?" "O, tell me, who is nmore fond than I am, of these beauties!            ked Sarah. ", And have you any at home?" asked Sarah. ", Not where I live now. There is little sun in the yard; the rear being closeld packed .with brick houses, and quite damp withal."   ! ,         KATE STANTON.           75 ( We generally remove to N. in the summer," said Sarah; ( but I always start a few flowers here, for I like to have the neighbors enjoy them from their windows, and I hate to see a yard where the sun has so great a power as here, and yet nothing for the sun to warm and beautify; and this season our house at N. is repairing, and father says it will be late in the season before we can go there, even if we go at all." And don't you find it a source of much annoyance, Mrs. Maxwell, to remove each spring and fall, as you go out and come in?" asked Kate. "It would be- such, but that we keep our city house par-. tially open during our absence; and, of course, we don't move the furniture, but only ourselves; and Mr. Maxwell enjoys the farm so much in summer." ( And well he may, during summer; but save me from a winter's sojourn in a country house!" said Sarah. Aunt Fussell is just going out to pass the summer months i] -  as usual, I suppose," said her brother Charles. "She is," said Sarah. "Aunt Fussell," soliloquized Kate; " surely it cannot be the lady I met under such circumstances, and yet it can be no other; she talked, I remember, about 'Sister Maxwell.' -   WWhat a difference in two sisters!" thought she. "And can it be that I have been working for her son Charles? Yes, it must be so. I would really like to know, if I could ascer- tain without asking; and yet, what good would it ever do me to know? Those shirts were for some one about to start on a journey, and he must certainly be the person. I wonder if 1; . ,8  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6993-00000039"/> 76        EKATE STANTON. William will recognize the work when he sees them in wearing?" "It may be wrong to say so of one's relations, but I do hope that nothing will prevent her going away to rusticate this season," said Charles. "I need hardly ask you why," said Sarah. "Of course I can appreciate your feelings, but it will make little difference to you this year whether she remains in the city or not." "No, not on gmy account, certainly; I was thinking wholly and entirely of yours; she is so very fussy (I beg your par- don, Miss Stanton),f fssy by name and fussy by nature; and as you are to remain in town, Sarah, I would have you as separate as possible." "Thank you kindly, Charles. O, how I pity cousins Ellen and Marianne! But they are so patient, that they get along very well with her. I am not so Job-like myself." "But you would be, Miss Maxwell, if she were your mother," said Kate, half crying. "I might, perhaps, but I am not overstocked with that car- dinal virtue, and nmiht grow weary in the way of well-doing," replied Sarah. "But here comes father, and he does not enjoy hearing any one speak disparagingly of his own and only sis- ter; and I, too, beg your pardon, my dear Miss Stanton, for mentioning family failings in your presence." Good-evening, friends," said Mr. Maxwell, as he entered the garden; " and these must be our young guests, Miss Stanton and her brother. As no one introduces me, I must perform that service for myself." O, father, I forgot!" said Sarah; "I forgot that ceremo- I'   KATE  STANTON.

"And I, too," said Charles, advancing; " but allow me to introduce my friend William to you; he of whom I have spo- ken, and whom you were kind enough to allow me to invite to accompany me on my journey, to-morrow." "And allow me, sir," said William, " to thank you now in person for your kindness; and, let me assure you, I appre- ciate your benevolence." "Pshaw! pshaw! young man; it's all right, all right. You are a little pale yet; get up your color, and increase your strength, and that will be thanks enough for me." "Tea waits," said Mrs. Maxwell; and they all answered the summons, and returned to the house. The beautifully-lighted and pleasant tea-room brought to Kate's mind the remembrances of very early days, when her mother occupied the post of honor at the tea-end of the table; and she almost felt as if she could remember her own father at the opposite end; but so young was she, in those days when a father's face was seen at home, that she had no distinct remembrance; but so happy did the Maxwells seem, that she felt that her home may have once been pleasant also. O, delightful home, when day's labor is done, and the family is seated at the evening board, and all care and weariness is laid aside! Not so the breakfast hour; the mind looks for- ward in anticipation to pleasure or to gloom; the noon finds many hearts worried, and mind and heart harassed and fatigued. But now the day is over, the day-book is closed, the ledger posted, the accounts finished, and the merchant and the clerk, the mechanic and the journeyman, having hied 7*  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6993-00000040"/> 78        KATE STANTON. home to tea, in the bosom of their family and friends, the wife has her tale to relate, her day's experience to unfold, and the little prattler has to tell what new thing he may have learned at school or at play; and, when older grown, the youthful maiden or her brother, has something to say of their prospects or their schemes; and the happy parents listen with unfeigned pleasure and gratification, and live their own youth. ful days over again and again. This evening the Maxwells were, however, rather silent; and the usual gayety was somewhat dispensed with, as each reflected on the morrow's separation. Mrs. Maxwell, mother- like, pondered on what might befall her son before he should again behold their gayly-lighted apartment; and the father, with a calmer air, which he may or may not have felt, thought on what he should do without that son's presence; while Sarah had thoughts of a similar train, as she remem- bered their usual evening walks, and other pleasures. As for Kate, she felt for all; and in thinking of all, she could not omit, in a slight degree, herself. As for the ilmmediate parties, Charles and William, they could not yet realize the change which they were themselves effecting. Tea over, Kate reminded her brother of the necessity of early retiring, and they shortly took leave of their kind enter. tainers. "What a pleasant family!" said Kate; " and so wealthy, too; and yet so agreeable, and not showing anything that looked as if there were any condescension towards us, their inferiors in everything of this world's goods," said William. O, there can be little of that arrogance in the best of so-   KATE STANTNN.           79 ciety; it is only in the half-civilized, ill-bred classes of the wealthy, that lack of courtesy is perceived and realized," re- plied his sister.

"That 's the very thing," said Kate, " the courtesy I men- tioned that makes the guest feel perfectly ' at home' and at ease, without any studied and chilling formalities." i -  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6993-00000041"/> CHAPTER IX.

"I am up and dressed," said William, and he threw open the door.

"Don't cry," said his sister; but she was crying too, dear girl, and William must have been stoical indeed, not to have sympathized in that tearful eye, and manifested his share of heartfelt emotion. "Dear Kate," said William, "would you now have me forego this separation?" "No, I would not, dear brother; but we do not know the strength of our ties until they are called into trial; and now it seems hard to suppress my feelings, and yet I am not selfish enough to say ' Stay at home.' But come; Mrs. Maitland has breakfast all in order, and we have little time, even for the little we may feel like eating." William submitted, and though the food almost refused to be eaten, and his throat seemed very choky, yet he managed to pass through the meal in some degree of partial ease, but daring not to say one word. A sadder breakfast he had seldom eaten; and now the last mouthful was taken, and he rose from the table, and went to his chamber to take a last look of everything it contained, then shouldered his trunk, and brought it to the entry in read- iness for the carriage. Poor Kate busied herself with rubbing the brass nails on t , i  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6993-00000042"/> 82        K A T E ST ANTON. his trunk, and trying to brighten them as much as possible; but her blinding tears prevented her doing this last office with any degree of satisfaction. But still she rubbed them, and tried to fancy she was very busy, and then she hoped she was not crying; but if she was not, then nobody ever did cry. It was no use to say "Don't cry, Kate;" so she and her brother cried together, till the carriage arrived, and the driver knocked at the door. Mrs. Iaitland, who, out of respect to their feelings, had ab- sented herself, now came forward, and added her benediction; and, after once more clasping his beloved sister in one last, long embrace, William took his seat in the vehicle, waved an adieu, then sunk back beside his companion. For some time no word was spoken by either. Each had thoughts of his own, and the impressive partings and leave- takings prevented all attempts at immediate conversation. Little was said by either Charles or William during this ride; and they had nearly reached the station before they could command their feelings sufficiently to appear with any complacency before strangers. They soon, however, by masterly efforts, checked all out- ward manifestations of feeling and emotion; and, before they had proceeded many miles on their journey, were enabled to look about them with some degree of satisfaction. William wondered whether the people in the car with him all felt just as he did. So apt are we, when pursuing any journey for pleasure or otherwise, to think that every one else is interested, because we are, and by the same cause. He had as much as he could do, however, to notice the varied scenery, as they hurried along the railroad track. He   ;[:-        HKATE  STANTON.         83 observed with surprise the varied and changing landscape, and would at times appear to catch his breath, when the cars passed along any narrow defile, or when they dashed over some bridge, beneath which was tumbling and foaming some angry water-course. And he was amused, too, on observing the cattle spring aside, as the loud-screeching steam-whistle warned them of their danger, and with what appeared to him their look of wonder and alarm, as the noisy cars rushed by them. On, on they go, through mountain-gaps, over bridges, along water-courses, still rattling, puffing, panting, and screeching, awakening the very inhabitants of the leafy trees, and scaring every animal that was within range of ear-shot. All this was new to William; as has been already remarked, this was his first steam-ride, and he was surprised, too, that he was not frightened and alarmed. He was surprised at his own calmness, although he had heard of boilers bursting, of cars running off the track, and like casualties. At length, by car and steamboat, our travellers reached New York; and here they found all bustle and confusion again. The ticketed porters were running hither and thither, seizing the baggage of the unwary, and levying all sorts of taxes on those passengers who, like our young friends, they knew from W   their appearance, were unused to travelling, and easy marks on which to exercise their cunning and deception. After paying double fares, and something extra for their luggage, they were set down from a hack they had engaged to take them to a hotel; and here they were to breakfast, and rest if they could where everything was noisy and clam- ;   orous.  -  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6993-00000043"/> 84        K A T E ST N T N . Determining to remain here for a few hours, and look about them, they did not take the cars for Philadelphia till nearly noon, so that they arrived in the Quaker city at about dusk in the evening. And here let us for a time leave them, and see what their friends were doing at home. We left our Kate sobbing and crying, and we now find her wiping her swollen eyes, and trying very hard to show a ghost of a smile. ( Come, Miss Stanton," said Mrs. Maitland, it 's no use giving way to childish grief. These separations are only for a time; were they for eternity, there might be some show of reason in it. I want you to take a walk with me; it will aid to restore your fallen spirits, into something more congenial and summer-like. Help me to clear away the breakfast things, and we will then go out and see some poor people, in this neighborhood, that you may at least contrast with your condition." To finish their occupation, and prepare themselves for walk- ing, was the work of but a few moments. As they left the house they turned down a street to the right, and, after passing along something like a quarter of a mile, they came to a row of ten- foot buildings, not a great distance from Traverse-street, on the left side. To enter one of these houses required some degree of calculation, as the street had been recently graded, and the old and broken-down doorway was below the side- walkto the depth of about a foot or more. Stepping down this, and with a slight inclination of the head, to avoid coming in contact with the door-facing above, they gently pushed open the door, narrowly escaping from injuring a parcel of dirty children, who appeared to be wallowing in the muddy entry.   KATE  STANTON.         85 Leaving open this door to give them sufficient light, to prevent the certainty of such a catastrophe, they opened another door in the passage; and here broke upon their view one of those pictures of misery and distress, which many of our residents are absolutely ignorant of, and who scarcely believe that such needy humans are within their reach. On a wretched bed, with a ragged and torn counterpane, lay a poor woman, upon whose wan and withered features sore distress and want were firmly pictured, and whose wasted form but faintly showed the extent of her intense pain and suffering. A chronic rheumatism had for many years tortured her feeble frame, and her limbs were sadly drawn up, and her -   muscles seemed, many of them, to have changed places. Rest she could not; and to move or turn herself in bed without as- sistance was out of the question. Her easiest position was, when it could be done, to be supported upright in an easy- chair, and be propped up with pillows; but this was often denied her, for she could ill afford to fee a nurse, aid what at- tention she did receive was meted out quite precariously, and sometimes even grudgingly. :     In a corner of the same room, but rather behind the bed that Mrs. Crockett occupied, lay a man, her husband, but in a beastly state of intoxication,-begging the beast's pardon, however, for even a swine will never 'get drunk' but once,- helpless as his wife was; but by his own fault, while her trouble was her misfortune. Mr. Crockett had been a shoemaker in his better days; but that enemy to the family peace, the wine- cup, had taken the place of the lap-stone, and the fatal glass, his awl. 8*  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6993-00000044"/> 86        KATE STANTON. "Mrs. Crockett," said Mrs. Maitland, "I have brought a young friend to see you to-day; as I wished her to see with what patience you are submitting to the divine will. Here, Kate, is a woman, who says she is perfectly happy!" "Happy?" asked Kate. "And why not?" said Mrs. Crockett. "My pains are intense, and, as you must see, I am a most distorted-looking being; but within me there is no distortion. And thanks be to God, who has taught me to bear with patience, and, I trust, with resignation, all He sees fit to put upon me! Were not my husband such as he is, I should have few matters to disturb my peace." "How long have you been in this condition? asked Kate. "Just four years next month. For three and a half years I have not left this room; and I shall never leave it but once again." "Is your case then so incurable?" "So the doctors agree; and I have had several to attend upon me, of all sorts of systems of practice, as allopathy, hydropathy, homoeopathy, and quackery." "Is your general appetite good?" "It might be; but my powers of digestion are necessarily not strong; and of late, I feel I am sinking." "Can nothing save you?" asked Kate. "Nothing, child; and I care little how soon I am called hence.  I am ready; and by me you must certainly feel that your sympathy is hardly needed, for the Great Messenger will have no dread in my mind." Mrs. Crockett was all she appeared to be - a devout, though suffering Christian; and if ever there was one such, she was a       .       KATE  STANTON.          87 true Christian. Amid all her trials and agonies, she was never known to murmur; Put taught all who visited her a -, \   lesson of perfect and enduring patience. This is no fancy picture, but'a stern reality; and Kate left SAL   her presence with the feeling that she had seen something she could remember, and she hoped she might practise upon  .  in her own character and life. : "One more scene let us visit, if you can bear it, Kate; but you must summon all your fortitude. It is not such a *,$,4  one as I would wish you to see every day, and God forbid ::^  it should be common!" Passing down the stairs, they continued their walk to the further end of the same row of old buildings from which they had just emerged; and, entering the last one of the block, they went up three flights of clumsy-constructed and rickety stairs; and, on reaching the landing, they paused one moment before they entered the room now straight before them, the door of which was ajar. "This is the place, Kate, that I spoke to you of; and whatever you may find in this room you must think of, and brace yourself to bear to see, unflinchingly." '-I   "I will try," replied Kate. : tThey entered noiselessly, and found a large family in the   last stage of degradation, -pure, unadulterated degradation.    The wine-cup had been here too, and something worse than I:  the wine-cup. In the further corner of the room, and opposite the door at which they entered, was a bed, - or rather a large bundle of rags, improperly termed a bed, -upon the floor; and on ",  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6993-00000045"/> 88        KATE STANTON. this pallet was stretched the dead body of a female, wan and emaciated. As they advanced towards it, all there was remaizing of a man sprang towards them, and, staggering across their path, exclaimed: "What do you want here? You're too late; she's sung her last song, and she's gone. A pretty rig this is to leave a husband in! Her jig is up, and I wish mine was." "Mr.    ," Mrs. Maitland began. "Out with it, old beldame that you are! Why do you hesi- tate to speak your old friend's name? Time was you did n't mind to speak it, and to speak it often, and, perhaps, to my cost. Perhaps you cannot bear the sound of it again, ha! ha! ha! That's a good one, she won't speak her old friend's name " "Henry! do you know where you are, and who lies there so stark and stiff?" "Yes, I do; and so do you, Moll; and what of that?" "Moll! who is Moll?" asked Mrs. Maitland. "Blast it! I was thinking of Moll in the corner there, ha! ha! ha! She 's stone dead, dead, dead; and you or somebody knows who did it, iMrs. bMaitland." "Henry, do you know in whose presence you are standing, and you talking so?" "Yes, I do, in yoZurs, if you call this standing." "Yes, in mine, to be sure, but in a higher presence, too!" "c Don't conme here to talk to me of 'higher presences' now. I won't hear it, --I tell you I won't!" "Mother, mother, wake up!" cried a number of little voices; "( father 's come home, and he's - "   KATE STANTON.           89 iI "Poor children!" said Kate; "your motther will never rI!  wake again; she has gone to the spiritMand!" - Not wake up?" said one. "She 's dead; she cannot come back to you, but you can go to her." -"Ha! that they can," said the father, " and soon, too; they better be going." "Henry!" again began Mrs. Maitland. "Don't Henry me any more! If you have anything to say, why, say it, but don't stand mumbling and muttering there; I can't and won't stand it; I tell you I won't, and I won't. See, see! see that snake there; see him crawl, see him twist him- self; how he writhes! he starts again, he raises his head!" "Where is the snake? I see none," said Mrs. Maitland. "( There! there! he is around my feet; the thing is trying to coil up my leg; now, now he's coming. Ha! my throat! O! ------ Poor man! Down he sank, faint and exhausted; too many imaginary enemies seemed flitting around him, and the delir- ium tremens was wearing him out. "Let us go for assistance, Mrs. Maitland; we alone can do no good here," said Kate, shuddering. "One moment more.  See, he is opening his eyes again." "There, there, the snake!

"O Henry, Henry! the loath. some draught has done this for you; and you, my poor, poor niece, who have suffered so much from him! O that you had taken my advice, and never united yourself to so ungrateful a monster!" "( Was she your niece, then? And she has had this trial to bear alone." "( Yes, dear girl; but I did what I could, and no one could have done more. She was a lovely girl as one would wish to see; admired by many, and esteemed by all her friends, till, in an unlucky hour, she knew and finally married Henry Bowen, then a young and gay clerk. For some years they lived partially happy together; that is, they never came to actual blows. Years rolled on and on, and a number of chil- dren were born to them. You see here five of them, and they have buried three others, all older than these. Then he took to gambling, and when excited he drank deeply; and, to make a sad story short, he is now dying before you, and she has only a few hours preceded him. Her death, no doubt, was caused in part by a broken heart. Now, what 's to be done? I will stay here, if you will go for Dr. Beach. Though his medical skill can be of no avail, yet he had better be called." Kate went as directed, and was fortunate enough to find him at home, and ready and willing to accompany her back to the wretched scene. "( It is all over, doctor!" exclaimed Mrs. Maitland. "He has just breathed his last; his frolics are ended." "What! is this young Bowen,--the gay, the handsome Bowen, that used to drive the handsomest span of horses that   S^        KATE STANTON.           91 ever was known on the Neck? His race has been a hard one, and poorly won." "Hard indeed, sir; but the poor thing opposite was more tq be pitied. How she bore with'him, repenting too late their ill-mated and ill-assorted match! and now they will both share one grave!" "And these children!" exclaimed Kate, "what is to be -i.  done with them?" :   ("They must go to the home for the destitute, or the alms- house; there can be no help for them in any other way; they may then be adopted by some one or other; they are pretty children and may excite some interest," said the doctor. "A hard lot for my niece's children; but it is the best that can be done at present, I suppose." "Yes, unless you know of half a dozen families who would give them a lift, and a helping hand." "I do not, I am sure; for myself, I am too old now to un- dertake the rearing of a young family; so, if you will aid me, I will see to their removal to the Home; that will be better than the alms-house." Dr. Beach approved of this, and agreed to inform the trus- tees of the house. Mrs. Maitland made some preparations for a decent funeral for the unfortunates, and then proceeded homewards. She did not feel right about the children, but felt it was the only thing she could do at present. Though grieved for her niece, and distressed by her fate, she summoned all her strength to pay the last tributes of affection to her remains, and the unfortunates were in due time interred. -i9  t -'     -    &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6993-00000047"/> 92        KATE STANTON. This service over, and the first shock, caused by the sud- denness of the occasion, having somewhat subsided, Kate, slowly, but steadily and faithfully, fell back upon her more immediate duties of life, filled with the conviction that, lonely as the world had seemed to her, yet there were others a thou- sand times worse off than she; and she nearly succeeded in her search for happiness and contentment. There were times when her life seemed hard, and her lot seemed a trial; but her health was spared, and her strength maintained, and thus was she enabled to bear up under a great and severe load of difficulties. Whenever she felt downcast and forlorn, a walk in the open air, or a ramble to a neighboring town, brought vigor of mind and strength of resolution, back again to her aid and command. Thus passed her time as pleasantly as circumstances would permit, and her brother's absence would allow. N   It CHAPTER X.

"Say that again, Dick, and I'll show you some of it, lik  dinked sweetness long drawn out,' my fine fellow," replied'  Burton. "Come, come! fair play's a jewel," said Green. "What 's the use o' fighting and quarrelling?"  "Who's a quarrelling? Shut up your clam-shells, or I 'll give you something to open them for.

"You was rather too balmy--a little too much sprung; your man, Maxwell, learned too much of your character. I 'm afraid you've lost that game, and my share of the plunder with him, Burton." "I 'll bet high on it yet, though, for all you say. A few soft words will fetch him round again. He likes fun, and I can make it for him, only let me get out of this horrid den." "Horrid, surely! But why do you stay now?" "They say that boy's case is critical, and I may be wanted. They will search long, before they find me here, however, if you are all as cautious about coming in as I am about going out. Sam Swallow has been skylarking about Marm Mait- land's for these three days, to get a sight of the old woman,  and learn how the case is going, and he 'll be here to-night, when it's dark enough. What time does the watch change, Dick?" "At the dead twelve, Tom; old Ranger is on the beat to- night, they say, and he 's got the gout, or rheumatism, or spring halt; any way he can't walk very tall, and your time's good. If Sam brings good or bad news you may as well slope; and, if you choose, you can dodge old Ranger, and get back again after you've stretched your legs a bit." "Where 's the cards?

There's money to be made, and a pretty girl into the bargain." "No, no girls, Tom; they are the very devil to have around, unless you're law-locked with them, and that 's bad enough; they are always in the way." "Then, never mind the girl, but the money, the money, Dick. Pass that bottle this way. Are you sure, Dick, that Green is unconscious?" "Like a log, Tom. I'll give him another dig, if you say so." ' No, but help me here, and let us pitch hint into the old well-hole; it's dry now, and won't hurt him; and he can't get up till he's wanted particular," said Tom. "There you go!"

Now, I want to lie up there till the store is closed and locked for the night, and all is quiet and still. The large doors bolt on the inside, top and bottom; but they can be opened easily. To those doors there is no outside lock; every night the porter bolts them hard and fast, and double bolts, and draws a heavy bar across, and then goes out the single door at the side, and locks that door with a key, of which, as I said, I have a mould, but don't want to use it, ^ s t  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6993-00000051"/> 100        KATE STANTON. In this way I can easily let you in, when I hear you whistle our old signal; and then, Dick, for the plunder!" '    That all sounds very well, Tom, but there's too much of it to suit me," said Dick. "Not so much, after all, Dick; it's more in the telling, - that's all; and I could not spir it any shorter, even for you hist! hark whose cat is that?" ", Only our mew! all right! all right! Sam." "Ay, ay, old cock, all right it is, and likely to be righter and no tighter, old boys! I say, Tom, your chap is doing well enough, and is going to live it through." ", How did you learn all that, Sam?" said Burton. "Easy enough, easy enough. I found the old hen looking out the front door just as she was going to roost, and I made bold, I told her, to inquire after her son as was hurt so bad; and she was as communicative as a sieve, and I strained and drained till I pumped her dry of all she knew about him; but she said he was not her son, though; but anyhow he's doing well, and will recover; so there's for you, and what have I earned by it?" "A purse of shiners, which you shall have when I get them, which won't be long first, I warrant you, Sam," said Tom Burton.. ,' It was a narrow escape though, the old woman said. I don't wonder the bright red mark began to show on your neck; for you would have had to swing sure, as you are too good a boy to be let alone after another scrape." , Don't mention it; here, Dick, hand me the dark Otard to take the taste of the rope out of my throat. I almost began to choke already, as Sam spoke of the red mark. There, that will do finely, now; that's good prog, anyhow."   KATE STANTON.          101 "Now where's Green to be put?" said Tom. "He may as well be let out now." "Who's Green?  You don't call me green, eh?" said Sam, " and I don't see anybody else." "Can't you see through a mill-stone when there's a hole in it? Don't you see something green down there?" said Tom, pointing down the well-hole. "Am I an owl or a bat, to see in the dark, Tom?" "Mind your old bones then, or you will learn too soon. Show a glim here, one of you!" "There then, look now or never. So do I serve all eaves- droppers and cheats, when I want to do all the cheating my- self," said Tom. 6"He wanted all the blunt on the ring-board, and, as he could not get it by fair means, he sought it by foul; so I floored him, and we earthed him, and now let's get him up again." "Give me a rope, and the lantern," said Dick. "Now swing me clear, and I'll go down to him; easy now,- all right!" A moment passed, when Dick called out: "Tom, he's done for all eternity!" "You lie, I believe, you young rascal!" "Lie or no lie, come down if you will, and see for your. self; he's dead as a door-nail, and who shall say I did the deed?" "No one, if you will keep your tongue between your teeth, you hound! and you, Sam, what have you got to say for yourself, eh? You won't peach, eh?"

"I say, Tom," exclaimed Dick, " here's a go, and a goner. What's to be done?" "Nothing easier than to shove one mean spy after the other! So, make ready and grab him, quick! Grab him, Dick, and down with him!" "More than you two can do, and do your worst!" "Stop a bit. Look here, Sam; I've had enough of blood on my hands for one while," said Burton; " so, if you will swear, by our old oath, to secrecy, why, you need n't die just yet." (; And is it in you, Tom Burton, to say when I am to die or live? I who have shared so many of your wild pranks, and Harry Bowen dead too, or rather just going to die?" "What do you say, villain!--Bowen, and he going to die, - what mean you?" "Ha! I've waked you up, have I? Then let me say, Bowen's got the tremens bad, and his jig 's about up."  Bowen, say you? I think you lie. Who told you so, Sam Swallow? Speak quick, or you're dead now!" "I know it is true, Tom; and he's one of your best hands; quite a gentleman trickster," said Dick.

And even if I got clear by turning state's evidence, I could not make as much out of you strung up, as if you were to live on a little longer, with my help." "Fill him a glass, Dick, and then to our work; it's no use putting it off; I must leave this place, though it's held me safe so long." "Heave in a few of those old bricks, Sam," said Dick, " and let that be his grave; and it 's as good a one as he would ever have got, for he was born to be hanged, and the only differ- ence is, the old dissectors have lost a victim. There, that 'll do. Now heave a little of that rubbish on top of the bricks, and it will never be noticed; only we must set the place on fire, when we leave, and what with that, and the rubbish tumbling in, when the old shell falls, why, we are safe enough." "Dick," said Tom, "I don't half like this job. We never meant to kill John Green, outright; but there's one thing, it's done; and he's no wife to be looking him up, and as to his other relatives, I'll risk their asking for him." "No more they won't. Come, help us pocket what's here, belonging to the gang, and then we 'll leave this den. Nobody will ever occupy after we've done with it, and it's a grand night for a fire."

The wind was high, and, aware that they would not have to wait long to see the result of their work, particularly as they gently raised a window to procure a  draft of air, they deter  rined to conceal themselves behind a neighboring fence, and watch the progress of the flames. And now the fire burns, and now an alarm is raised; the bells ring on the midnight air, ad, as the fellows wait, the engines rattle by, and men place themselves for action. Too late for any good; the frame is all on fire; the flames rise on high, and the old building totters; it falls; and, in less than an hour, nothing is left but a pile of smoking ruins! The men in waiting peer out from their hiding-place, and gaze around them. The firemen have done all they can, which avails nothing; the wind is too strong for them, and the raging element conquers. Sloly the firemen roll up their hose, and quietly seek their homes; and under that smoky mass, which Burton felt must have completely filled up the chasm where lies the murdered man, the secret seems safe, and he and his companions breathe freely.             dtheir beds; the mur- They, too, sought their homes, and their beds the mur- dered and the murderers sleep, butnot alike!

The morning dawned at length, and where is Tom Burton, and where Dick Melcher? Afraid their own shadows might betray them, they seek the shady side of the street, for they can sleep no longer. Conscience has been at work, and, by a similar and not unnatural impulse, they both, by different streets, wend their way to the scene of last night's doings. A number of curiosity-seekers had already gathered on the spot, and the two worthies now mingled among them, intent to hear their conversation, and gather from their remarks what might be the general opinion as to the cause and origin of the conflagration. "Was not this set on fire?" said one. "This place was not inhabited," said another. "I don't know about that, sir. Strtnge noises have been heard around the building of late; and, though some say it was haunted, I am led to believe it was only the haunt of human spirits of evil. Be it as it may, it is as well it 's burned, for it has never stood very well in the town's estima- tion, and lately less than ever." "Old Reed broke up a gang of counterfeiters there last year, and, since then, suspicions are rife that it held persons of bad repute." "Suspicions of what, sir?" asked a man in a slouched hat, who had just come up.

IT is needless to relate that William Stanton and Charles Maxwell, after a few days given up to sight-seeing in the city of "brotherly love," and sauntering along its suburbs and vicinities, proceeded on their western tour. It is also needless to say by what route they journeyed; any guide- book will furnish the inquiring traveller with all that is neces- sary on this subject, and considerable more, besides, that is neither necessary, nor beneficial, nor interesting. Suffice it, kind reader, that they reached the allotted head- quarters at Nashville; that William devoted himself to the interest of Charles, which he felt must also be the interest and benefit of the firm at home. Suffice it, that here he wrote to his darling sister, Kate, a full and lengthy account of all his doings, journeyings, sight- seeings; not omitting an account of some little swindling and imposition he was a victim  to, in company with his friend i  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6993-00000055"/> 108        KATE STANTON. Maxwell. What traveller is not liable to this, who journeys for the first time? Six weeks they remained at Nashville, occasionally jour- ne-ying amongo the neighboring towns; and William soon be- came acquainted with what was necessary in order to make himself useful and valuable to his friend, and through him to his friend's employers. At the end of this time, Charles, having carefully remitted to Boston the result of their united labors, and having fin- ishcd all that his instructions, relative to business, devolved upon him, proposed to William to journey further west; and,   T if it should be feasible, on reaching Missouri, he proposed to leave William at a farm belonging to an uncle, who had long since made the west a pleasant home. To this proposition William joyously acceded, proud to feel that he had been of some use in the world, and to his friend;  and he was pleased, too, with the prospect still opening before i him of visiting those scenes, which the pioneer had but just made inhabitable, fatr westward. After a prosperous journey, in which, indeed, he observed more of a varied nature than he had before realized,- the vast and almost boundless prairies, covered now with the most beautiful and elegant flowers that the most fastidious could wish; and the nearlyInterminable cotton and tobacco   * fields, which promised a rich and valuable crop to the indus- trious and energetic planter,--he reached the abode of a wealthy farmer, in the central part of the State of Missouri, to whom Charles introduced himself as his nephew, and Wil- liam as his friend. Mr. Hanson, uncle to Charles Maxwell, had been bred a   KATE STANTON.           109 mechanic, and had in early years succeeded in obtaining a good livelihood in New England; but in one of those crises which equally injure the merchant and the mechanic, found himself behind in his business, and finally failed. His creditors seized everything they could find, and he had the usual vexations and embarrassments to sustain and en- dure; but, being a single man, he chose to push for the west- ern country, in order to retrieve his losses and begin the world anew. After living two or three years as a day-laborer, he was enabled to purchase a tract of land at the government price, and began to renew and improve it. He then married a strong and healthy western girl, and, though many years younger than himself, she proved to him a real help-mate, though wanting much of that polish which a New England home is calculated to inculcate and furnish. A log-cabin, rudely constructed, supplied them for a num- ber of years with sufficient shelter; and, by the time three children were born to them, they had so improved their acres as to have them in good cultivation, and well tilled. Of late, Mr. Hanson had largely added to his first pur chase, till he had a good farm of several hundred acres of prairie and timber land well located; and, still -later, had erected a house of hewn logs, that also boasted a real brick chimney, and even between the logs the crevices were 4" chunked," as it was called, with lime. Clay had till now been the building material as an accompanyment to the logs, and when this house was raised, the neighbors-the nearest a quarter of a mile away-thought it excelled by far any- thing they had for a long while seen. 10 ! *         &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6993-00000056"/> "O        KATE STANTON. Mr. Hanson's family appeared to William to be a very pleasant one. The oldest child was a girl, now about twelve years of age; the second, a boy of eight; and the youngest, a girl of about five years. They were pretty children; but the fever and ague - that   ^ plague of the new states-had taken off any ruddiness they might once have possessed, so that they appeared puny and somewhat delicate. Mr. Hanson, for the same reason, appeared to have lost    I much of the vivacity natural to his earlier years, and had somewhat settled down to premature stiffness of limbs, and a sort of languid temperament. The old smile, which, as a New England man, he had inherited, seemed to have left him; but he had not forgotten entirely his old jocular ways, and, when a little roused, could yet conduct his part in the enter- tainment, whatever it might be. "Nephew, I'm heart-glad to see you and your young friend here; it's many a year since I was east, and it may be many more yet before I go to the land of my youth; but I have not forgotten anything of the good old times, though the old ' shakes' have racked my bones, till I feel prematurely old and infirm." "Wthy don't you cure yourselves of this ill?" asked Charles. ," Why don't you cure the sun from rising, or the moon from giving her light? You might as well do so. I 've been here now some fifteen or eighteen years, and I don't seem much ( climated' yet; and I don't know how-I try the qui- nine as does everybody here, but it don't amount to much in the end. It's a singular fact, but nevertheless true, that   KATE STANTON.          11l those here who drink the most whiskey have the least of chills and fever; but I fear, with me, the remedy would over- balance and outweigh the disease I would try to cure. You may laugh now ; but by and by, and you choose to stay long enough here, it will be my turn to laugh at you, when you make up a great rousing fire on that hearth in mid-summer, the thermometer ranging at eighty-five to ninety degrees, and you roll yourselves in blankets and quilts, and lie down almost into the ashes, and then shiver and shake till actually your teeth chatter with severe- cold. I say it will be my time to laugh at you then; but it will be no laughing matter, when, in an hour afterwards, you are in a raging fever, every chord and muscle in your frame undergoing a sudden change, that will almost throw you into convulsions, and make you feel as though if you could lie down in an ice-house it would be as much too warm for you as before the fire you were too cold. There, how like you that picture, my young friends?" "Bad! bad!" cried they both. "And yet it is all true, and few here escape this or bilious fever in some parts of the year; and my farm is as high and healthful as any near here." 4"You do your own labor, I see, sir," said William. "Have you no slaves?" "No, they are only a bother and trouble; in some of the plantations below this place they are numerous enough, but I am too much of a northerner still to like them much, and I had rather hire what I need to have done among our own people. I have no near neighbors; but in this place, as you will see to-morrow, are a number of families, tenants of mine, who rent portions of my land, and who aid me in cultivation,  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6993-00000057"/> "2        KATE STANTON.                 t and receive their pay in kind. To those whom I supply with teams and utensils I look for half returns in the crops; and those who find their own, pay me one third of what they raise. Should I sell any of them a cow, or a few hogs, I take my pay in so many hundred rails for fencing, or so many  ^ days' labor; for mloney down is a scarce article, and except a drover comes along to buy cattle, as they often do, I see little of that commodity; or when I take a trip to St. Louis, for stores and such household matters that we cannot manufacture here on the farm, a load of hams or deer hides brings ready sale at that market." "And you like this mode of life?" asked Charles. (t Yes, on the whole, though it is hard work; but come, sup- per's ready, and I know you must be hungry," said Mr. Han- son, as he led his young guests to the i" keeping room." "And here is my wife, the partner of my cares and joys," resumed he, as they passed in. "A right sort of a one," thought Charles; a' at any rate, she appears to be so," as he saw the well-spread table. "We give you a western reception," said Mrs. Hanson, smiling,; " pork and bread, and bread and pork, in such vari- ety as may be." "And you make your own butter and cheese, I suppose, do you not?" asked Williamu.  "Yes," said she; " everything we have is of our own rais- ing and producing." "And you weave your own cloth, I suppose," said Wil- liam, glancing at a large loom, that occupied the end of the room. "Yes, and always have, except an occasional dress that   KATE STANTON.      113 husband brings home from St. Louis. Linsey woolsey is the chief fabric. What you see now in the loom is a quilt -" "Then you have sheep, too?" asked William. "We keep a few," said Mr. Hanson; " but they require much watching, and, at night, high penning, or the wolves would soon make them fewer."' "Wolves!" exclaimed Charles; " and are:you not always alarmed for yourselves and your children?" "4 O, no! We never give the matter a thought. They are cowardly things, these prairie wolves, and sooner run from us, than stay to attack; unless, indeed, they come in packs, and that they seldom do in this part of the country. While you are here perhaps I'll show you some sport in hunting them." "I think I should be afraid," said William. "There's nothing to be afraid of, not in the least; I think them harmless. It is the black timber wolf that may really cause alarm; and there are none of those in this vicinity, and have not been since I first settled here. A bounty was paid on producing their ears to the government agent, and they rapidly diminished in number." "And do you have any game to shoot?" said Charles. "That we do, that we do, indeed, and in abundance, too! The prairie hen,- the best kind of food,- and rabbits, gray squirrels and partridges, in abundance," said Mr. Hanson. "If you are fond of that sport, you shall have your fill of it, while you are among us." :; That mustkbe but for a short time, at present, as I must hasten home; but if my friend here can make himself suffi- ciently useful to you to pay his way, he would like to remain a while with you and your family," said Charles. o 10*  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6993-00000058"/> "4        KATE  STANTON. "Willingly; and we will strike such a bargain, that young Stanton will, I think, not find it in his heart to object to. Eli, my young friend?" "I have no doubt of it. I was not born to be idle, sir,"  said William; " and I don't mean to begin to be now."  "I want you to share, Charles, in one good wolf-hunt, be-  fore you leave; and, as it bids fair to be pleasant to-morrow, and it's best to be in a hurry about such things while the fine weather holds, suppose we name it settled?" said Mr. Hanson. "With all my heart," said Charles. "The horses are in good order now, and since we finished ploughing, they have had but little to do, and I don't mind  giving them a try," said Mr. Hanson. "I suppose you can ride horseback, of course?" "I can," said Charles. "And you?" "Not I," said William. "Never was on a horse's back in my life." "You will soon learn, my boy; we never walk much, here, when we can ride." Like all other mornings, the morning came; the sun rose clear, and all things betokened a pleasant day; and Mr. Han- son collected his neighbors, with their dogs and horses, and, breakfast being ended, started off in company. They were well mounted; and even William, somewhat timid, was with them. He was advised, however, not to ride after the wolf, at speed, but to place himself where he could see the sport. They soon reached the prairie; and the dogs, not at loss   K-A TE STANTON.         115 to understand what their duty was, found the scent, not of a wolf, but, as it seemed, of a deer, and evidently sur- prised, too; as, so cunning and watchful is he generally, that he is only captured after a long chase. Whether the wind was against him, cannot be now noted; but he started up from the high grass in which he had been lying, and in a few bounds a large dog seized him by the tail; but such a kicking as he received, soon made him release his hold. "Come in! come in!" shouted Hanson to the dogs; and back they all came to his horse's feet, whining and disap- pointed. "That's my best dog," said he. "Last spring, a deer crossed my house-lot, only a few rods from the house, and that  dog was lying outside, just beyond the fence, and, as the deer sprang over very near where he was, he started, and seized him by the throat, and brought him down. I happened to be near by, and the dog held on till I came up, when a knife soon finished him; and we had venison for some time. I would not part with that dog for his weight in old iron! But we don't want deer, to-day, Watch. As we are out for a wolf, why, we 'll have one if we can." "What are they smelling around now for?" asked Wil- liam, as they rode a little further along, keeping an eye on the movements of the hounds. "Probably for some other game; though it may be they are still on that deer's course. It's a pity-I think it's a cross scent; but see, there they go! Now for it!" shouted Hanson, as the dogs sprang forward once more. They ran thus for about two miles, when the dogs seemed again to have lost the scent; and they no longer kept a straight course, but appeared confused. l  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6993-00000059"/> "6       KATE STANTON. "There 's a branch! '" said one of the neighbors, riding up, and pointing to a small stream a short distance ahead. "He must have taken the water here, and the dogs are confounded. But there - no - yes, they've got it again! Now then!" Another run for about three miles, and Mr. Hanson called  out: "There he goes! I see him now; but he's a long way  ahead of the dogs,-just there to the left, along that edge of timber; he seems to be making for the wood!" "Where?" asked Charles.  "( There- now he's turning again; see him?- there, where the grass is cut through. He sees the dogs now; and they will hardly lose him, as they did before. See, they've changed their smell for their eyes; at least so it seems. It may be a long hunt yet; he runs fresh, and can't have been roused long. I don't know how long the scent keeps in the grass; but he must have nighted here -see how the grass is pressed down!" A few more miles' riding, and again the same neighbor who came up before called out: "They must have got him. Hear how they howl! He is probably baying them." "So I think," said Mr. Hanson; " and we'll have him now, sure!" Hastening their horses, they soon reached the scene where the dogs were assembled. They had caught the wolf, and he was showing fight; but they soon throttled him, and a hunter's knife put an end to his struggles. "Well, Charles, what's your opinion of wolf-hunting?" "It's exciting; but I am awfully galled and tired, it s so   KATE STANTON.          117 long since I have ridden so far. Are you going to cut off the ears?" "No; unless you want to show them to William. Perhaps he 'd like to see them; but it's not worth enough to show these to government; so we never cut them off, unless for curiosity. Take this knife, and I'll show you how to cut. There -draw it thus, so that the skin from between the ears is sufficient to hold them together in pair." "Wlat ails that dog?" said Charles. "He's bit bad," said one, "in the leg. That's the wolf's doing; he don't hold on when he bites, but he snaps quick; How he bleeds!" (And what do you do for it?" "Seldom much of anything; he cures himself best. If I were to bandage it, he would tear it off, and soon lick it well himself. I generally tie up a dog for a few days, so he shan't run, and get a fever in the sore; and I have had 'em bit 'most to the bone, and seen the muscles laid bare, as the loose skin falls away each side. But a dog is his own best surgeon." "Have you become tired of waiting for us, William?" asked Charles, as he returned with the company to where William was standing. "By no means; but I only wish I had dared to keep up with you in the chase. It was rare sport, I think; but what i?,(  have you there?" ")  "The wolf's ears. How easy to take a wild animal by the ears -ahem - when he's dead!" said Charles, laughing. "True enough, too," said William.  "William must learn to ride," said Mr. Hanson.

There are twenty-five; and they are of all grades, good, bad and indifferent." "I should like to do so, if I can find one gentle enough for  a beginner," said William. "If you are all for gentleness, you will find the old gray mare much the best. She 's fast or slow, just as you please, - walk, trot or gallop. She won't throw you, I assure you, though you may fall off; that won't be her fault; and, if you can balance yourself, you can go to sleep on her back, at full length, and, even then, she will carry you safely. I have tried that way more than once, when on a journey, and I have been saddle-sore from a long jaunt."- "It will be long before I can do that, I think," said Wil- liam. "O, you can learn to ride easy enough, if you only have confidence in yourself! You must often expect falls, and sometimes you will be thrown, unless you are riding old gray; she, I say, will not throw you; and she is a real lamb for you-- mere child's play to ride her. When you have learned enough to wish to venture more, I have a ' four-year-old ;' but when you ride her, you must never take off your hat while on her back. If you do, you will be on the ground before you are aware of it!" W( Why is that?" asked Charles. "I don't know," replied MSr. Hanson. "I suppose some- body taught her the trick.

"Queer beast, surely!" said Charles. "What other va- rieties have you among the horses?" "Well, there's an Indian pony, as fat as butter, and as round as a barrel-will do anything and everything. I bought him of an old Indian, who came along one day, being particularly struck with a very knowing look he seems to have, and an eye that makes one think he is laughing all the time; and I think he is. My babies set everything by him, and more too. He plays with them, will chase them all over the field, running at them, mouth open, showing his teeth, and shaking his thick mane at them. When he comes up to them, he will suddenly turn away, and then return, and lie down, and let them stand on his side, and he will remain perfectly quiet while they are there. Here he comes, now. See what a specimen of health he is!" "But do you let him run loose?" "Yes; my horses are always loose in the summer. They live in the open air, never going into the stable from June to November, except during the time I am working them, and t  then I must give them grain. Otherwise, they are no expense to keep; the prairie is their home, night and day, and grass is plenty." It  "Do they never strauy away?" asked William.

"I could give you many accounts of my horses; but you will see them for your- selves, and be your own judges of their merits and demerits, and I don't want you to rate me a horse-jockey because I have my favorites." "(I will not, for one," said Charles. "Nor will I, for another," said William. The horn now sounded for dinner; and, unsaddling their animals, and turning them loose, to go where they listed, they entered the house. A well-filled table greeted our friends; and well had they earned their noontide meal, and the staple production was fully welcomed. The old stand-by - by which, of course, is meant pork, in several varieties of cookery-was found upon the table, flanked with a pair of fine-looking prairie hens, contributed by Mr. Hanson's little son. "There, pap; a'n't there a fine couple for you! I caught them this morning in my four-trap. See how fat they be!" said little Henry, gleefully. "( That they are, indeed, my boy; and you must show our friend William how you do it," said his father. c Why, pap! don't he know how, as big as he is?" said Henry, opening his eyes very wide. "iWhy should he, my boy?  He never saw such game before." "Well, I 'll show him how it's done, unless he wants to shoot them instead." "No," said William; " you may show me your way first."   KATE   TANTON.        121 "It's easy enough; you've only to put corn under the trap, and you 'll find the hens all right in the morning; just as easy as you choose," said Henry. "Easy for you, I suppose, because you know how it's done," said William, laughing. "I don't believe you know how we catch the blackbirds that eat up our corn," replied little Henry. "And how is that?" asked William. "I don't know as you will think it just right; but I tie horse-hair around the little kernels, and sometimes I bore a hole in the corn and thread the hair into it; then I throw it on the ground, and when the bird eats it, why it only chokes him; and that's the way." "A strange child this!" thought William; and stranger yet he thought him, when he learned that he could ride any horse his father owned, except old Roan, who was too vicious and ugly to be mounted with safety by so young a hand. "Now, pap," said little Henry, after dinner, "you said you would show me the hickory roots; and will you go now?" "That I will. Come, friends, let us go with this young scamperer into the woods," said his father. And away the party sauntered; and, on reaching the tim- her lot, they searched in the bushes and shrubs, among the hickories. "Here they are, by jingo, pap! Here's your fine hickories, a'n't they?" For the benefit of the uninitiated, let it here be said that the young shoots from the hickory trees, and the slender stalks, drawn out by the roots, are very fine and sweet to the " -   &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6993-00000062"/> 122        KATE STAN TON. taste, if eaten as soon as drawn from the earth; and the longer the root, the better for eating. "(How can we get them up?" asked William, as they took with them neither shovel nor hoe, but only a small hatchet. "I will show you," said Mr. Hanson; and, cutting down a small sapling, he fashioned it into a prop or lever, around which he twisted the pliant stem of the young hickory; then, placing one end of his lever upon the ground, he pulled strongly, but quite steadily, and forth came a long, milk-white root, which made Henry shout for joy. One after another they pulled upon, now drawing them out, and now breaking the withes, till, finally, they obtained enough for present eating, and for roasting in the ashes when they should reach home. "It don't know," said Mr. Hanson, "whether these are peculiar to this western latitude, but I never saw any in the woods at the north; but here, when I have been at work away from the house, I have often dined on these roots, and wished nothing better." "( They are good, indeed," said Charles; " and may, very likely, have been the food of the Indians in former years." "I have no doubt of it," said Mr. Hanson.   CHAPTER XII.

ANON. "O, Is not this delightful, mother?" said Sarah Maxwell, as she stood, in the bright moonlight, by her mother's side. "It is, indeed, my daughter; and I am  not sorry we came out here, even as late in the season as it is; as it was only complimenting your father for the neatness and tastiness with which he has repaired this old and lovely dwelling." "Yes, mother; particularly as he did not expect to get the house to rights, and the repairs ended, so soon. I really be- lieve he meant to surprise us, and let us imagine we should have to stay in Boston all summer; and it had become so hot there, too, and so sultry as to make us feel as if we  were melting all away!   It's a charm to be here at last," said Sarah. "How is Kate, to-night, Sarah?" "She is asleep, now, and seems to be easier." As I am thankful for that, poor girl!" said Mrs. Maxwell.  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6993-00000063"/> 124        KATE  STANTON . And how comes it that our Kate is here, in the country? you ask. Mrs. Maitland, soon after William had left for the west, was taken violently ill; and even the kind attention of Dr. Beach, aided by the anxious solicitude of our heroine, who soothed her pillow by night and day, was of no avail. For a few weeks she lingered, and then gently sunk to rest; as quietly as the flower, that closes its leaves at nightfall, and droops its head upon its slender stem. After the last sad rites were completed, Dr. Beach urged Kate to make his house her home, and thither she removed, though rather reluctantly, as she disliked being a burden; and the kind doctor, feeling that she had much need of rest and quiet, refused to allow her to labor in any way. And truly did she need that rest. Overcome with excite- ment, and much watching over the sick-couch of Mrs. Mait- land, she was herself quite feeble and careworn; and, instead of deriving that benefit which the doctor felt a change of scene ought to bring to her, she grew rapidly worse, till she had become a mere shadow of her former self, and caused him alarm. At this juncture, Dr. Beach, calling upon Mrs. Maxwell one day, and speaking of his young ward, and her feeble con- dition, urged the necessity of her breathing a purer atmos- phere, where such might be found; and in Sarah Maxwell he found one who coincided with him in his solicitude, and she volunteered to ask her mother that our Kate should become a member of their family, for the present at least. To this, both parents willingly consented; and, full of joy and pleasure, Sarah called on the doctor at his house, told her   KATE STANTON.          125 success, and, after a very learned and lengthy tirade from his eloquently eccentric sister, prevailed on Kate's removing to their house, as they were just going into the country. And now we find them at N., and Kate, weary, suffering, Orf'  feeble Kate, resting among friends, who are doing everything in their power to alleviate and amend "How beautiful this water sounds!" said Sarah, as, with her mother, she still continued to stand on the little foot- bridge, in the bright moonlight-- "purlin, urlinrling along; and it seems as if talking to itself, and as if it were happy, too; and how it bubbles and bubbles along over the coarse gravel-stones!- and O, see that bright trout, as he darts along, just at the edge of those reeds!-now he has slipped under that large stone. The stream seems almost as clear as noon-day. But, mother, why are you so sad, to- night?" asked she, earnestly. "I am not sad, my dear daughter; but I was engaged in thought,-so entirely, as hardly to realize you were beside me, my dear." "And will you not read me your thoughts, mother dear? ' "I was thinking, as I look back in memory, of the days and years long gone by; of the early years, when, younger than you are now, even, my little feet used to patter along this same little bridge. The same stream was then as bright as now; but not the same water--no!- all that has long since found its way to the ocean, and been lost among its rushing and mighty waters! And still the stream floats along; and on its surface many and many a time have I floated little chip boats; and my young brothers and sisters sailed their boats, too; and each little boat, slowly, slowly, but : II 4 1*  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6993-00000064"/> 126        KATE S T A N T O N. O, so steadily, floated down the stream on its course! --and yet this little brook keeps flowing on. "And those brothers and sisters, too,--they went out on the broad ocean of life; but, like the waters of this little stream, were soon engulphed in the larger and nobler stream, that floats onward, onward to eternity! "Yes, one after another sought that rest to which I also am hastening; and this young girl, your new acquaintance, reminds me of one, and another, and another! "Trip along; ripple, ripple on! Mingle your peaceful waters in the great ocean tide; but O, as you lose your identity with this once gentle stream, aid the great ocean itself to ebb and flow forever! 4' Yes ; and thus must it flow forever!" "But, mother, is the thought a painful one, that it makes you so serious and reflective?" "No, my daughter; but reveries of the past are always more or less gloomy, as, in their review, I must of necessity call upon memory for the loved faces and forms of those I may never nleet with again this side of eternity. Here was I born; in that house erected by your great-grand- father, on the very spot where he found the wigwam of the savage Indian; and here was I bred in homelike simplicity; here was I taught the great lessons of life and death; for death, as I have implied, often entered here, and young and old and middle-aged felt the presence of the Eternal!" "( Mother, did you say that this is a part of the original Indian purchase?" "Yes, my child. From the road in front of the house, as far as your great-grandfather could ' throw a stone, or shoot a   KATE STANTON.          127 rifle bullet, on either side of tim,'--such was the traditionary bargain,-'for a hogshead of fire-water, and a case of tobacco, given, granted, sold and otherwise forever conveyed by him,' the old sachem granted and thus deeded this land. Genera- tion after generation have divided and sold parts of it, but yet these six acres remain together, and will, I trust, long remain in the family as a portion and an inheritance. The few alterations necessary to be made on the house have been thus made when such necessity required and demanded, but the main timbers are the same that have held the old man- sion through many, many years; and with God's blessing may they long continue to do so!" "And amen! say I, dear mother; and do you suppose the Indians used to fish in this brook?" "I don't know why not, my daughter; it has been a fine trouting ground in my day and generation, and I doubt not for a number of long years gone by. Old as I am, my dear daughter, I remember to have seen my grandfather draw out fish after fish from this stream; and, as of late there has been but little fishing done here, the brook must be rather full;- but hist! my daughter, who is that approaching hither? He has just walked up on the railroad yonder, and is climbing the wall, and here he comes, indeed, full towards us." "It is Charles, mother!" "Charles! no, it cannot be, and so soon returned from his journey; it cannot be, child!" Indeed it is, though, mother, for here he is to determine it," said Sarah, gayly. "Charles my son! And how came   you here, and at this hour?  and when did you return from the west? and how  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6993-00000065"/> 128        K ATE STANTON. do you do? and how are all our frienlds?" exclaimed his mother. "; Why, mother dear, how you follow wit-h question after question! I came because I wanted to come.  I have fin- ished my workc at the west, had a glorious time, seen every- thing and more too, done everything you carn land ctannot im- agine, and here I have returned safe and sound." "Thank God! thank God!" exclaimed IMrs. IMaxwell. "Amen!" said both the children. "Well, my boy, are you well? and are you strong and hearty?" "Look at me, mother, while the moon is yet on my feat- ures, and tell me, am I not the picture of health itself?" "( So you seem, my boy; but what have you done with your friend William, who went with you? where is he?" "; Safe and sound, I trust, mother." "Trust! don't you knowz how he is?" "I left hini well." ,' Left him well! how's that? Is n't he with. you?" "No, mother; I left him in Missouri, and at Uncle Han- son's, in the tallest kind of clover." "( Aas he willing to stay, Charles?" asked Sarah.

"And his sister, Charles, his sister! what will she think of his being left out there?" said Sarah. "Sarah, do you ask what will she think, -she, a sensible girl as she is?

"Have you been to see her to-day?" asked his mother, with a knowing look he did not notice.    4 "No, mother, I did not arrive till just in time to take the cars home, as, in your last letter, Sarah informed me I should find you here, and I came from New York in the day line." "And your baggage    ?? "I left that at the depot, at the village; I can send Mike for it to-morrow." "Don't you want to see Kate?" asked his sister, smiling. ",-Perhaps I do, and perhaps I don't; but what is she to me, I should like to know?" "Ha! ha! ha! Charles--you, and ask me that!  You, to ask me wzhy you want to see her! Don't you love her to dis- traction?" "I hope not quite so badly as that, dear sister; but I can wait till to-morrow, when I go along the street she lives in, as I go to the store." "What would you give, my son, to see her before that time, if you could?" "Why, I suppose I would give something, mother; but why do you ask? and why do you, Sarah, nudge mother so?" "She is here," said his sister,!" and yet, you cannot see her at present." "Why not, and to-night?" ( There, there, don't be so impatient, Charles! I thought you was not anxious to meet her, from your appearance." "But what do you mean?    Is she really here, mother?"  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6993-00000066"/> 130        KATE STANTON. "Yes, my boy, but very sick, and confined to her bed, and must be kept very quiet." "I think," said Sarah, "(she will not live long, even should she survive this attack; and that she is too good for this world." "Fie on you, Sarah!" replied her brother; 4'too good for this world! that 's an old maid's saying! Don't make yourself one at present, if you please. It's always the way with some folks,-if a person is what one ought to be, he's too good to live! Dear me! I pity the rest of them, that's all. A poor compliment to this earthly sphere if none but the meanest and lowest are the longest dwellers on its surface." "But she seems so pure, so disinterested and forgetful of self, indeed, so self-sacrificing wherever she can be of any ser- vice, called or uncalled, that it seems as if she could not be long spared to do so. She now suffers on account of her great exertions during Mrs. Maitland's severe illness." "I know, I know --you wrote me about it. What does Dr. Beach think of her condition?" "He says little, but I know he thinks the case criti- cal in the extreme; he has been out here twice to-day, and, though she rests somewhat easy to-night, he says it is but an even chance of life or death; and that a few days at farthest must decide her fate. She is fairly broken down; her strength nearly gone, and only her buoyant spirits left her." "Poor, poor Kate!" murmured Charles. "Then you really love her, Charles?" "I do, most sincerely, my sister." "And yet, how wide a gulf between you!"   KATE STANTON.          131 "How so, Sarah? "She is---- Poor, you would say; and so she is, as far as go this world's goods; but, you yourself say, so rich in heavenly attributes!" "Would you brave the world's opinion, Charles? Would not people say, the rich young Maxwell married a sewing- girl?" "Let them say what they will; I care little for the scorn or applause of the wide, wide world, if people will only go no further than their tongues may lead them." "I know, dear brother, you value little the words of the meddler; and best it is that you do not, for you must live the easier; and I am very glad you feel as you do about Kate, for I have only asked you this to try you." "To try me?" "Yes, I wanted to know what were your real sentiments towards her." Well, are you satisfied, my sister? Will we not do for each other?"  "I think so, surely; you are rich in this world's goods, and she in those of heaven. Your riches may fly away, as such things often do; but hers are of a more abiding nature, that storms and gales only serve to strengthen and attach the stronger." "Well done, Sarah! you are really poetic in your praises to-night. Now, cannot you make some fine episode to yonder moon, ere we join mother, who is sauntering away there by herself? It is just now a beautiful theme; almost at full, and, except for that halo around it, would make this a perfect    &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6993-00000067"/> 132         KATE STANTON. night, indeed. They have a strange story at the west, about this same halo. They think it foretells some great wonder, and that the number of stars in it, is an index of so many years to come between the present time and the aforesaid strange thing; but each one has his folly." "If i give you anything of poesy, it must be of a borrowed nature. What do you think of these lines, from Gray? 'Now night in silent state begins to rise, And twinkling orbs bestrew the uncloudy skies; Her borrowed lustre growing Cynthia lends, And on the main a glittering path extends, Millions of worlds hang in the spacious air, Which round their suns their annual circles steer; Sweet contemplation elevates my sense, While I survey the works of Providence! '" "Very good, and very well remembered are they, Sarah. And now you will remember what the poet Milman says: c Dost thou rove, Idolatrous of yon majestic moon, That, like a crystal-throned queer in heaven, Seems with her present deity to hush To beauteous adoration all the earth? Might seem the solemn silent mountain tops Stand up and worship; the translucent streams Down the hill-sides glittering cherish the pure light Beneath the shadowy foliage o'er them flung At intervals  .

"He should be here soon, but he has much to attend to, even when not called by business of the store. Every- body wants him to attend to every one's else wants, and he goes hither and thither, -now a church meeting, now a Sunday school teacher's gathering. To-night a book and pamphlet society is organizing in the village, and he has gone there. Last night he was wanted at a political meeting-- always some- where; and, even when at home of an evening, people of all kinds call and take him by the button, to aid in some work or other." "And why don't he decline?" "He says, if he does not go forward, that no one will do anything; and he feels such a desire to do what he can, that he rather overdoes." ' Just like him, Sally ; he feels, I suppose, that the village is on his hands, and without him it would fall." "It does really seem so, Charles; at all events, when we came out, the Sunday school was in a poor condition, and the min- ister called upon him, with the request that he would become superintendent. I was in the room when he called, and such a piece of work there was, to be sure!" "How's that? - a quarrel?" "No; I wish there had been, for then father would have done nothing about it; but, as it was, the minister, Mr. Lane, -who is a preacher of the word, by the way, but not a doer, --wanted him to take the charge, and he did say he would, "i without much consideration or reflection; and weall winked and scowled at him, but father did not look at us once during Mr. Lane's call; so he was booked for that."  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6993-00000068"/> 134        KATE STANTON. "Of course, Mr. Lane visits the Sunday school, and says a kind word occasionally, sister." "Not he, Charles; he is not the sort for that. On the other hand, he says he is not able to do so at all, though any- body can see that it is not for want of strength, but be- cause of downright laziness." "A pretty character you give him, Sarah!" "It is a true one, nevertheless. Why, he never makes a call in the whole village, unless he wants something done, as in this instance. The people don't know him. He don't even go to perform a funeral service, unless especially sent for, and regularly invited. A strange state of things really; but yet this statement bears the full impress of truth and soberness." "Why don't you and mother reform him?" "It is no use to try, Charles. Can you bend the tough oak, or change the ocean's roll?" said his sister earnestly. "Father is too willing, Sally; and yet it is not for the sake of empty praise, or fulsome flattery, that he allows himself to be drawn into the public vortex; but he does cer- tainly get in strongly, I fear." "He says that he loves the excitement; but I think he has care enough of his own, without intermeddling with other folks' affairs." "My children," said Mrs. Maxwell, "question not your father's motives. But would you know more, let me say that he wishes to build up the town, as far as one mind alone can do so; but it is a very hard work, since he is hardly seconded by any one, and particularly by those to whom he feels he has a right to look for aid in these matters."   E KATE STANTON.         135 "But, mother," remarked Charles, " why need he labor so in an almost hopeless cause?" "Because, my dear boy, no one seems willing to sacrifice himself for the public good, and it has fairly come to this, that to close the yawning gulf, a,Curtius must plunge in." "And why should he be that Curtius? Why don't the village people take care of these matters for themselves." "They won't, either from indifference or a lack of ready zeal," said his mother. "Here comes father, at last," said Sarah. "What, Charles here!" said his father, entering. "Why, how did you arrive, and so unexpected?" "But not unwelcome, I hope, father?" "By no means, my son. You are looking well; is he not, Julia?  "Quite the picture of health and vigor," said Mrs. Max- well. "Ready, then, to buckle on the armor again, to-morrow, Charles?" "I am, sir; though, for want of practice, my hand must be rather unsteady; but it won't take long to bring all right again, I trust. You are busy in town affairs here, I learn. Are you not doing more than health warrants, and prudence dictates, father?" "I trust not, my son. It 's hard to see things at sixes and sevens, and not a helping hand held out to protect, to save, or to improve."

"Do you not fear to become the mark for scandal to aim at, and that idle gossip will invent a less plausible motive for your line of action, conduct, or pursuit? Such, I think, is the habit in many country villages, and I doubt much if N. is far behind its compeers, in the prevalence of the words that burn, and the wounds that spread, rather than heal!" ( What have you done to-night at your meeting?" asked Mrs. Maxwell. "It was determined to have a subscription reading-room." "And make you chairman of a committee on the papers, I suppose," said Mrs. 3Maxwell. ( You are wrong this time, Julia; though it was proposed to do so, but I declined serving in that capacity." "O, I am glad of that!" said Sarah. "Yes," said her mother, "so am I; but whom have they chosen in your stead?" "Guess, Julia." "Not Mr. Lane, the minister -" "The same!" said Mr. Maxwell. ("How? Did he accept, pray?" ("He did; but he seemed nettled with the idea he would have to do something in the village. I am glad of it; and he had no chance to decline; so he is fixed for that, at least; as the chairman always has the work that is to be performed upon his own shoulders. I was obliged, however, to accept as one of the same committee."

THE day had been hot and sultry, with scarcely motion enough to dissipate the feverish dryness of the close atmos- phere, as Mrs. Fussell and her twd daughters stepped aboard the steamer that was to take them to the Glades, whither they were going to pass a few weeks in idleness and genteel dissipation. It was towards evening, and nature seemed hushed, save where, just above the horizon, was seen a dark and angry cloud, ominously black and threatening, from which issued occasion- ally a bright flash of forked, chain-like lightning, and fol- lowing which was heard the distant-sounding, grumbling thunder. All else was still, and death-like in it silence; and   KATE STANTON.          139 1   after the low, grumbling, muttering sound was silenced, again nature seemed sinking into repose. But nearer and nearer seemed that cloud, and again nearer and brighter flashed that lightning, and deeper, louder, and heavier reverberated the sound of the distant artillery. And now it seemed tumbling, tumbling, rolling, and jarring, as it appeared to pass away, angry in its sound. Hark! Again that low muttering, and now that grumbling; and again that louder peal, as if earth were shaking in her orbit, and struggling to get loose from the heaven-created bonds. "It rains now, on the Blue Hills surely, I think," said Ellen. ( O, how beautiful the horizon looks, as the sun is thus sinking to rest, with that long, low, golden line, so con- trasted with the blackness just above it!" "O, yes," said her sister; "( that streak of golden light, so splendid, and so typical of the realms above!" "Where is mother, Marianne?" "She is below.

Would you believe it? she is sitting in the saloon, with a feather fan under her feet, as she says that is the safest method to ward off the electric fluid. And she gave me her watch, and all her rings and jewelry, to hold for her till the storm is over." "Just like her; and yet she could not have thought that you were rendered a conductor with all these gew-gaws on your person." "I know, I know; but never mind, if she feels safer.

"I hope she will not suffer from her fears; but it does pain me to see how childish she grows from year to year, and I had almost said fromn day to day; and with each new cause of trouble or anxiety, straightway she tries something or other to cheat old time." She does," said Ellen; " and, as it appears to divert her from her views of ultra-economy and selfish frugality, I feel a degree of inward relief and satisfaction. I hope we shall land and reach the hotel before the storm." "So do I," said Marianne. "Has father done all that is necessary for our accommodation at the hotel?" "He has," replied her sister; "two beautiful rooms open- ing upon the balcony or piazza, and adjoining each other. He engaged them a month ago, and he has given me a line to the lessee." "And why did he not come with us?" asked Marianne. "It does not look well, sending us on this trip alone!" "Fie on the looks!" replied Ellen. "I am sure I care little for that, as we shall reach our quarters before it is quite dark, though it would have been more agreeable to have had him to wait on us, and see us safely in the coach; but he had some business to detain him in town to-night, and will not come till to-morrow evening, and then he will be here over Sunday." ' That is well. I wonder what they have at the hotel to distinguish Sunday from any other day?" ( O, they have good preaching, they say, at the little church on the hill; and I hear there is a very instructive preacher boarding at the hotel this season, who has been engaged to officiate," replied Ellen.   KATE  STANTON.         141 "Here we are at the landing," said Iarianne, " and there's the hotel." "I will get mother ready, if you will see to the baggage," said Ellen. ^"I will, and I am sure your job will be the most difficult; for if you wait to collect all mother's little duds, you will have your hands full for one while." "Come, mother," said Ellen, as she entered the saloon, "we 've arrived at the landing." "Arrived where, my daughter?" "At the Glades, mother; have you forgotten our destina- tion?" "Why, no, my child, not exactly; but I don't see why I should move at present. Don't it storm? I still hear the roaring thunder." "Let it roar, mother, and welcome, as it does not rain yet, and if we hurry we may still escape the tempest that is threatening so violently." "Don't hurry, so; don't hurry so, Ellen; you forget I am so old,-- humph, what was I saying? - not old, Ellen, but- but-older than you are, my dear daughter." "Yes, I think you must be a little older than I am," re- plied Ellen. "Older my dear child, well-perhaps--perhapsa--O dear yes! O, what was I thinking of, to be sure, Ellen, my dear child?" "I don't know, mother, but probably of me, as you have named me twice or three times in one short sentence." "Never mind the sentence, my child." "I won't, mother, unless it be to keep me here all night." X4  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6993-00000072"/> "2       KATE STANTON. "My child, my child, when will you respect the aged-I mean your elders, my dear?" "When you smile on me, mother dear." La, child! there now, will that do?" said the old lady, as she attempted something that resembled the ghost of a grin. "Now, mother, let us land, and I will help you with your luggage. What makes you carry so many packages whenever you go anywhere to stay ever so short a time?" "I cannot help it, my child; but I have not many this time, I am sure; only about thirteen in all." "O, mother, thirteen! - and do you not call that number many?" "Why, child, there are only my four little bags, two brown-paper parcels, one collar-box, one cap-box, one curl and hair box, one umbrella, one parasol, one leather bag, and one small valise--that's not many, I think, daughter." "Well, mother, never mind, let me get them together; the coach will hardly wait if we do not hurry." "But I cannot hurry, Ellen; it's out of the question." "O, yes you can, mother; only try a little." "There, there, my child; take care, or you 'll drop some- thing. Don't go so fast." "Nevenfear, mother, I 've got everything." "No, I am sure you have not, Ellen." "What do you miss, mother?" "My collar-box- my box of collars." "No, I have that safe; see here, mother, under my arm." "Then it's one of the paper parcels." "O, I slipped one of them into your pocket."

Satisfied at last, Mrs. Fussell was persuaded, and slowly followed her daughter from the saloon to the deck, and from thence to the wharf. "Where's Marianne?" said her mother. "There she is, beckoning to us by the coach, yonder. Come, they are all waiting for us." "O, my child, you always are in a hurry You don't re- fleet I am a little older than you are, and cannot go so fast." "Forgive me, mother; I will not hurry you any further; they will wait now, as they see us coming." To gain the coach, and soon to reach their destination, was the work of but a brief period; but Mrs. Fussell would have it that something must be missing. What it could be Ellen could not divine. She again named over each article, from the small valise, in regular order, end- ing with the four little bags; and when they were finally deposited in the apartment selected for her mother's use, she counted them anew; but her mother was again somewhat mys- tified, and thought she remembered something being dropped in the coach, or out the coach window, or in the hall below; something was wanting, she knew. "Ellen, my child, are you sure you have everything all right?' "Yes, mother." "I don't see the other paper parcel, child." "Probably not, mother, as that is in your pocket." "O, Ellen, my child, how you trifle with me!"  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6993-00000073"/> "4        KATE STANTON. "No, mother; what do you call this?" said Ellen, as she drew from her mother's pocket a long parcel, somewhat tum- bled and crumpled. "( There, my child! I knew something was wanting all the time. O, I am so tired I must lie down a while! ' While she is resting, it may be well to see what the girls will do with themselves as they enter the adjoining apart- ment. 1"Is not this nice, Ellen?" I( Yes, everything looks comfortable here; but we shall have very little comfort ourselves, mother is becoming so childish, ' and it is gaining so fast upon her; she seems fairly breaking up." "I see it, I see it; but there is nothing to be done but to bear with' her; she was always doing and doing for us, any- thing and everything, and it is our turn now to aid and sup- port her trembling steps." ( I should not mind it," replied her sister, "if mother would only realize that she is old, and not try to dissemble with herself so much, for she deceives no one but herself." "Yes," said Marianne, " and father sees it too, I know, though he says nothing about it; he looks careworn, and evi- dently feels a great deal more than one would suppose, unless well acquainted with him." "Now it rains merrily," said Ellen. "Did you ever see such vivid flashes, and hear such tremendous thunder, in all your life?" "I never did, certainly; and how dark it is growing! that must have struck somewhere. How very near the report sounded! Aro not you afraid?"   KATE STANTON.-          145 "Not I, indeed ; are you-?" "I do confess I feel somewhat so," replied Marianne, shuddering. "Don't let mother know your fears, or it will make her feel ten times worse than she does now," said Ellen, going towards her mother's apartment. "Is she awake, Ellen?" asked Marianne, softly. "She is not; but she might as well be, as she is talking very distinctly in her sleep, and appears to be counting. I suppose she is thinking of her bundles, for they have been worrying her all the afternoon," said Ellen, " and I have done my very best to make her satisfied." "Better she should be thinking of them, as she may be, than worrying about this greater cause," said Marianne. "I wish I knew that Martin is as safe as all her packages are. He must be very near here now, as the vessel was spoken some days since off Halifax, and ought to be in port very shortly, I should suppose." "Yes," replied Ellen, "though I think he must have put into Halifax for provisions, and, perhaps, for a market, and may, therefore, not be quite so near as we fear he may be; for I would rather he were five hundred miles at sea, than off this coast in such a wild time of wind and tempest." "So would I," said Marianne. Martin Fussell, the only brother of these young ladies, and but a few years their senior, was a gallant captain of a smart and stanch clipper craft, well built to stand sea-ser- vice; and he became his vessel, and the vessel became him; the one seemed born to command, and the other seemed well  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6993-00000074"/> "6        KAT Z STANTON  adapted to be commanded, and to be made subservient to his will. A fine crew had shipped with him on his last voyage, which was for Calcutta and a market; and they all as one man seemed devoted to Captain Fussell and his interests. His friends had often heard of him and his vessel, since he sailed away from home, about two years before; and his vessel was spoken a number of times during the passage out--was heard from at Calcutta, and, as we have seen already, had since been heard of as off Halifax, on her passage home. Martin was a man of much promise, of a fine figure, and of noble bearing; tall, yet well-formed and proportioned, and adapted for the profession he had selected. He had followed this for a number of years7 in all the grades from cabin-boy, green-hand, foremastman, in the naval and merchant service, till he arrived at the distinction of captain of the clipper ship Adrian, owned by his father and uncle Maxwell, in their joint copartnership. When in the naval service, he had been in some skirmishes with the free-traders in the Mediterranean, and had seen some share of fighting for the protection of the American com- merce; but, preferring to represent that commerce in a more advantageous position, that might be afforded in the merchant service, he resigned his place in the former when the time of his enlistment had expired, and was placed in command, as has been narrated, in a vessel well fitted for this purpose. Twice had Martin Fussell sailed in the Adrian to the Indies, and the present voyage ought now to be about concluded, and the gallant captain safe in port once more. Poor Mrs. Fussell had worried much about her son during   KATIE STA NTO N          47 the past few months, and that, too, without any apparent cause, other than that her advancing age was rendering her more than usually sensitive and timid. ,After the conversation just alluded to, the young ladies repaired to the drawing-room, from which they had long heard the sound of sweet music; and, as they entered, they found seated at the piano-forte a young lady of about the age of Ellen, and, to their mutual surprise, an old and valued ac- quaintance of hers,-no other than Miss Everson, the ad-, mirer of Martin Fussell, to whom  she had been long engaged, and for whose return she only waited to complete and close the said engagement by marriage. "I did not know that you were here, Ellen," said Miss Everson, smiling very fondly upon her. "No, we only came this afternoon, and have remained in our apartments till now, :when, leaving mother asleep, we wished to change the scene, so came below; but, dear Miss' Everson, I am delighted to see you here! How came you to come to the Glades at just this time?" "I knew Martin was expected home this week, and his vessel was yesterday spoken so near that I felt I would come here -  which I did last night -and watch for her, and then go back to Boston in the steamboat, and, perhaps, land about the time he will, and so meet hin unexpectedly; but I have had such fears and presentiments this afternoon, the storm has been so severe, the weather so very squally, and since dark has become extremely foggy and dim, that I dread the consequences to Martin and his ship. I have been play- ing on the piano to drive awaydull care; but all to no pur- pose. 1 cannot feel gay; and I have just heard guns, which I  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6993-00000075"/> "8       KATE STANTON. fancied to be signals of distress, and if such be really the case it is as liable to be his ship as any other." "But why borrow trouble?" said Marianne. "We have had so much to do to keep mother in blissful ignorance of Martin's danger, that we are both determined to wait till trouble arrives; and, though it may be his vessel, there are enoughl others only waiting for a wind to enter the harbor, to be either of them." Thus did these friends endeavor to enliven each other, and allay all fears of accident and difficulty, though each and all felt alike that their friend and brother was in extreme peril and danger; and their prayers that night at least were fer- vent and sincere that his life might be spared. At early dawn on the following morning, Ellen aroused her sister, and, going out upon the balcony, endeavored to peer through the surrounding mist. Miss Everson, as might have been expected, was there before them. The storm had driven wildly throughout the night, and little indeed had been her sleep; but, weary from watching and worrying, she was the veriest picture of unrest, with her long hair hanging in neg- lected clusters about her face and neck. "Do you see anything?" asked Ellen, gently. "I do not," said Miss Everson, "but I hear too much; listen to the roar of the swelling waves as they dash against the rocks, and throw their spray so high that even, with the gath- ered mist about us, I fancy I can feel a portion of it on my face. I trust this fog will rise when the sun comes up the horizon; it is now but half-past four." ,I Have you heard any news this morning, Miss Everson?" asked Marianne,   KATE STANTON.           149. "Yes, that two vessels have struck, and are fast. One off Nantasket head, and the other just below Minot's light ; - no, I don't mean Minot's light, but Harding's ledge; a place it is said almost as dangerous." "And the vessels' names?" "I did not hear them, and the man I inquired of did not know certainly himself." "Can anything be done?" asked Ellen. "I fear not much; but I learn that there is one of Fran- cis's metallic life-boats here, and I have prevailed on the owner to raise a crew; and, after much urging, he has done so, and I am going in her myself." "Miss Everson, are you mad or crazy?" "I hope not either; but I cannot stay longer in suspense, and I had rather go forward, and realize, or rather relieve, my fears, than remain quietly here in this worse condition, that of a chained female!" "Miss Everson, if you go, I go," exclaimed Ellen. "If Martin is to be your husband, he is my brother, and his claims upon me are as great as upon you; and, if Marianne will remain to keep mother calm, and ignorant of our course, we will set out as soon as the boat is ready, which is no doubt just about this time." "Ellen, you have loved our brother no better than do I myself; and if you go, I should also go," said Marianne; "Am and we will live or die together in this service." "Marianne, it is impossible; hear to reason and our wishes. Martin will, if alive, need some assistance, and Miss Everson and myself must suffice. If we perish in the breakers, our mother will have one child left to her and father, if you re- -n o t r '1  3  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6993-00000076"/> 150        KATE  STANTON. main on shore. Dead or alive, if found, we will bring Martin with us, and to your presence. Will that suffice?" "I suppose it must. So, if you go, God be with you!" "Amen!" said both the adventurers. Gathering together a few cordials, and such dry clothing as the boatmen could furnish, our fair fieight was placed on board the life-boat, when the willing oars soon set their load upon their way. "Who is captain of this boat?" asked BMiss Everson, of one of her companions. "I was," said one; "  but I yield the command to you, so far as our course is concerned. Where shall we pull to first, miss?" "To Nantasket head- it is the nearest point; but hand me the glass - yonder vessel may be the one we are in search of," said Miss Everson. "Take it, miss; but with it this life-preserver, lest there be more lives lost than saved. And here is one for your com- panion," said the man, as he handed two neatly-arranged and light cork-jackets, which the girls at once drew on. "That vessel has outrode the storm. See how she looms up in the fog!" said one. "Can   you make out her name?" "It reads 'Sand-piper,' " said Miss Everson. "Ay, I know her. She's a stanch coaster as will live through anything and everything," said the man. A shriek was now heard from Miss Everson, who still held the glass, and would have dropped it, had not Ellen caught it as her hand faltered, and she fell back fainting into the arms of an oarsman.  KATE STANTON.           1 "Cheer up, lass!" said he who now held her; "this is time for high-strikes, and faints, and such like." A few dashes of water from the skipper's hat soon broug Miss Everson to rieon once more ; before which, howev Ellen had learned the cause of her outcry and lalarm, as E read on a ship, lying bowis on, on the rocks of :Nantasket he, the name of the ADRIAN! "It was foolish in me to give way at such a moment," so Miss Everson, dashing away a tear, 1" when I wanted all r energy; but fhe start was too sudden.

WILLIAM soon became domesticated in the happy family of Mr. Hanson, and though the life he now led was different far from any which his youth had ever experienced, or his thoughts had ever dwelt upon, yet he found the truth of the ancient adage, that this "variety is the spice of lifc." Autumn was drawing near; the golden grain was ready for harvesting. The summer had been passed gayly, yet busiedly. William had become somewhat accustomed to toil, and inured to hardship and privation; and, although health and strength remained to him to the fullest extent, no one else in the house had escaped intermittent fever in its varied form and type. Being the only well inhabitant of the house, he was not alone in offering his services to the less fortunate members of it; and it certainly was not long that those members accepted such important and attentive bestowal with any degree of hes- itancy or indifference.   KATE  STANTON.         153 No one thought of applying to a physician to relieve or to cure fever and ague; but every house was prepared with the never-absent phial of quinine. This was ever the grand re- storer, or, as they called it, the grand reliever of the " shakes; " generally effectual, when used to break up the fever, if ap- plied in the outset. It was at this time that William, ever mindful of his absent, but ever beloved sister, seized every moment he could call his own, to talk over, on paper, the many scenes that occupied his attention, and he wrote as follows: "MY DEAR SISTER: It would take a volume of paper to tell you all the queer things that are happening here with me in this far-away land; so different from anything I have ever experienced before, and differing widely from what I may ever see again; and yet in nothing does it seem to compare with any experience that might be obtained or met elsewhere. "The broad swelling prairie, a real sea of the most beautiful flowers that one would wish to see adorning any home garden, and of every color and shade of color; - I have been revelling in strawherries, which grow wild in the utmost profusion and unending abundance;- the beautiful woods teeming with the brightest-colored birds in endless variety; game, ay, game of every description, to be found in plenty, sufficient to satisfy any sportsman. I am perfectly delighted to feel that I am here, and only regret that you are not here to share with me in my delight and happiness. Think not, however, that your own and only brother is so fairly captivated and carried away with all he sees and enjoys here, that he at all forgets his home, and his beloved Kate,  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6993-00000078"/> 154        KATE STANTON. far from it. I would I might now return, and hold you in one loving and long embrace; but, as our friend, Charles Maxwell, has been so kind as to allow me the privilege of coming here, and remaining so long with his relatives and fiiends, I feel that I ought to stay long enough to work for them and requite in some degree the many, many favors and pleasures I have been enjoying. "Mr. Hanson will want all the help he can obtain in getting in his crops this fall, and he offers to give me board and clothes for what work he may receive at my hands. Too liberal an offer for so young a workman; but it is evidently brought about in some measure by Charles, who had, I think, taken a singular fancy to me, though SMr. Hanson does not tell me that his nephew had any peculiar reason for any such preference; but I am just presumptuous enough to think that you are somewhat extensively concerned in the matter. "Now, Kate, don't think I am flattering you; but from all Charles has hinted to me, since our acquaintance first com- menced, I am inclined to think that you are of more interest to him than you think you are, and than he would wish to discover to you at present. "But I did not commence this epistle to you in this strain, to lead you to expect a love-letter, or any other silly nonsense; but to tell you what I am doing, how I am doing, and how I am succeeding in this new vocation, that of a farmer's boy. ( Mr. Hanson, as you are already aware, has a very large farm, of many hundreds of acres, much of it under extensive ti   cultivation. One field alone contains at this moment above two hundred and fifty acres of corn, nearly ripe for harvest-   KATE STANTON.          15 ing, besides a fine wheat-field of fifty acres, not to mention large tract well supplied with other vegetables. "His timber land consists for the most part of hemlocl maple and oak, with no small sprinkling of very majesti, looking black walnut trees. "These black walnuts are beautiful specimens of trees very handsome, and, when made into doors and window-sashe have a very rich appearance. 'I had always looked upon this wood as very rare ar choice; but when I saw, in this house, the meal-chests, boxe and in fact almost all the furniture, of this material, I wa amazed. "I have had no fever and ague this season; but I hav seen all the family, from the oldest to the youngest, shiverin and shaking as though they would shake themselves i pieces. Perhaps I am very cruel; but I cannot help laugl ing, as, in the warmest days this summer, I have seen the: build up a fire as large as is needed in a winter's day, rc themselves in buffalo robes, and then lie down on the hearth "Ah, boy,' said Mr. Hanson, as I stood one day laughiE at him, 'your time will come, and then see if I laugh you!' I cannot help it; the laugh will come, in spite of a I can do. "I have learned to ride on horseback, the only means c locomotion here; and though I have been often thrown off, has been seldom accompanied with any special bruises,- though it is rather hard work to carry a large bucket of flo in one's hand, or support it gently on the horse's should in front of me, and not fall off myself. "And it is rather har4:to have to go to mill, where all tl  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6993-00000079"/> 156       KATE STANTON. grinding is done by horse-power; to arrive at the mill just at night, too late for my grist, and be told I must wait till morning. "Henry and 1 tried this last month. The grist-mill is twelve miles from here; so, each taking a bag of corn on horseback, we sat out, and, on reaching the place, were obliged to remain all night, and almost without shelter. The  mill is only a machine, with a roof over the top of it, with- out sides to keep out rain or snow, or any change of weather. Here we slept, or tried to sleep,- which we might have done tolerably, had it not been that the cows in the neighborhood  kept walking in, and rubbing by us, and occasionally a hog would come snuffing and grunting along, without so much as saying, 'by your leave.' With these inconveniences, how- ever, I, for one, did get some sleep; but was not sorry to see  morning dawn, when, untying our nags, which we left outside, to feed or lie down, we fastened them to the mill-beam, and ground out our corn, cider-fashion; after which, by means of a  crank, to which I applied ' one hand-power,' I bolted a little  wheat I had brought for the purpose. Rather slow work, you  may imagine, but the only way it is done here.        i "I went last Sunday to church, if I could call it by that 4 name; and yet, I heard some good preaching. Picture to yourself a building without a floor, other than what nature  provided; without other window than a square hole, made by  r sawing out a piece of a log, and with no furniture of any description. I do not mean that there were no seats; but they were very rude, as you will think, when I say they were only made by having posts driven into the ground, and rising up about two feet, on the tops of which was supported each -t   KATE STANTON.          157 end of common rails, made no smoother than the woodman's axe could make them. The pulpit was of the same material, being merely a single rail, placed on two upright pieces firmly fastened into the ground, for the minister to put his hand on, for book he had none. "His sermon was good,- yes, excellent,- though peculiar in its style of delivery; and his voice, as he led off in the singing, was full and very melodious. He would repeat two lines at a time, and, they being sung, he would say two more lines; and so on to the end of the hymn. Whether he made up the piece, or not, I cannot say. I never saw it in print, and it seemed new to the audience. "He is a circuit preacher; but works here on a farm, during the week, as hard as any one. Hie gets no salary, is paid no money, lives by what he does in the week time, and is a very smart man in every sense. He is one of Mr. Hanson's ten- ants, renting a part of his land at the extreme end of the farm. "Yesterday a neighbor came to borrow a mattock. I asked him what he was going to do with it, and he said, to dig a child's grave. I accompanied him to the burial-ground,-I cannot say, the church-yard,--and there I saw a sight I shall not soon forget. It was nothing else than a small common, or pasture, with the usual zigzag rail-fence. No marble piles were there; no towering columns, to mark what memory had done to perpetuate the name and deeds of the loved ones who had too early perished; no monuments, to mark the spot where lay the wise and good; no sculptured stcne, to tell that here lay a man of spotless reputation, or that beneath' that " A Jg  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6993-00000080"/> 158       KI ATE STANTON. pile reposed a woman of rare character, and uncommon virtues. Simply, indeed, it was almost a place ' Where the pale flowers grow rank and wild, In that sequestered solitude; Where seldom hath the sunshine smiled,         j And steps may not intrude.' "Nothing marked the spot to tell the passer-by whose ashes filled the place; but around each mound, or large or small, long or short, was set a square-built rail-fence, some three feet high, merely to keep away such animals as might seek to depredate there. "It made me feel sad to think how little form was required, in this far-off place, to enable one to die and be forgotten; and I could not but look upward, to-day, as I attended the funeral of the little one, and think that above the bright vault and broad arch I saw, might be arrayed many a fond form; and then I thought of mother! "No neatly-arranged coffin sheltered the poor child's mor- tal remains; no varnished casket held his body; but a plain black walnut box, hastily, though neatly, put together, con- tained all that had been! No plate of silver, gold, or other metal, told its name, or dwelt upon its sad history; and when the present generation shall have passed away, none will ever  know the name or nature of to-day's deposit.  "Sad thought, that man is so unmindful and indifferent to his neighbor's interests of pleasure or of pain!--but this I will say, that here, in this little settlement, is seen no dry eye and unmoistened cheek, when the heart's grief is so abun- dantly poured forth.

"I am no great writer; but when I think how near at hand is the time when we were called so much, so bitterly, to mourn, on that chill Christmas day, I cannot but indulge in a few sad thoughts, as they do brim up and well up to the surface of my heart's reflections. "I did not intend to write you so sad and moralizing a letter; but my excuse must be the association of ideas; and I know my dear sister Kate will excuse and receive all. "I don't know when I shall return, but probably not till next spring, when, Charles writes me, a place will be ready for me in his father's store. I don't know how I have mer- ited such kindness, and so many favors, at his hands - God knows what I have done; but I do not myself know the mo- tive of his line of action. "I hope, my dear sister, you will not be anxious about me; for, though mother bid you watch over my deeds, and, if pos- sible, my 'thoughts,' as you said in your last letter, yet I hope I am in good hands; and I trust I may never forget her who bore me, or her who is now so desirous I should live up to my mother's respected character.

Meave you, as Mr. Hanson says that all his cattle have got into his stack-yard."   "I am glad," said Kate, as she finished reading her brother's letter, "(that William is so happy; and more glad still that he has not heard how sick I have been. And it is well he has not; for I would not break in upon- his joys and pleasures, which he says have been so full and enlivening." "And well may he enjoy all lhe does!" exclaimed Charles Maxwell; "( for he deserves to enjoy and be happy, when he does so much for others." "(I hope you do not flatter, though, in your high praises of him. I trust he does not himself know what his nearest friends think of him; for I would not have him learn to be vain." "He is far enough from that charge, Miss Stanton, I assure you," said Charles. The afternoon of a mild October day found our heroine re- clining upon a rustic couch, favorably situated under a wide- spreading elm-tree, near the brook, and adjacent to the old foot-bridge already mentioned. Kate had been carried thither to enjoy the refreshing breeze; and nature seemed almost to have provided the day on purpose for the comfort of the invalid. Propped up by pillows, she had just finished the perusal of her brother's welcome letter; and she rejoiced heartily at the success he had already met with. As she now listened to the little purling, rippling stream, as the water ran along over the gravelly bottom, she thought of her brother's past life, his early days, her mother's parting injunctions, her own faithful   I   KATE STANTON.   promise to aid and watch over her brother; of his succeeding suffering, when nearly destroyed by the ruffianly conduct of Burton; of his present absence; but more especially of the prospect held out to him for the ensuing spring. "You did not tell me of this plan," said she; "of this renewed manifestation of your peculiar interest in my poor brother." "And why should I tell you? Surely, I left your brother to tell it, as he has, himself, thinking it would give him the greater pleasure so to do; and also the greater pleasure for you to learn of it through him," said Charles. "We shall never thank you enough for ail your kindness to us, my dear friend. Had I but my health, I would certainly attempt, however faint it might be, some manifestation of our  real gratitude; that you might know we are not unmindful altogether of the vast amount of obligation and indebtedness we have incurred," "Say no more upon that subject, my dear Miss Stanton! The debt is fully cancelled by your own devotedness to not only your immediate friends, but to many whose claims upon your generous sympathy are few and ill-founded. Only regain your health once more, and all else will follow in good time." "I am indeed gaining strength daily, and almost hourly, surrounded as I am by so much that is alleviating and com- forting; and by such disinterested attention and untiring de- votion to my wants and needs," replied Kate. What was the promise you made your mother in her ill. ness?" asked Sarah Maxwell. "I promised her I would be every relation to my brother, -every relation in one; that I would watch tenderly over :^4-      &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6993-00000082"/> 1f62       KATE STANTON. him, look well to his interests as she would as a parent, give him such advice as I sister should, such counsel as an elder brother might render, and such aid as a warm heart might give and bestow; and I trust I may be spared long to fulfil that sacred promise." "And nobly was it made, Miss Stanton. I trust you will not blame our family if we lend our aid to you in this matter. Sick as you are, you cannot prevent it; and when you are recovered in full, we trust you will not try to change it." "I have no desire to do so, Sarah, though I cannot for the life of me discover why it is that you, all of you, have done so much, and are still lavishing all you can upon me and my brother." "I know, myself, that we only follow out our own incli- nation in so doing, coupled to be sure with a notion of our father's, that we do so on account of some idea of his own, which he will no doubt one day or other make known to you." c; Sarah!" said her brother, hurriedly. 4( Charles!" exclaimed Sarah, inquiringly. t"Sarah, don't say too much; we have no right to say any- thing to MissStanton, other than what we may know father would himself approve of; and whatever he wishes her to know he will explain all in good time," said Charles, in an -F under tone. "Be it so, then," said his sister, in the same voice, ,( though I am impatient that our dear friend should know all we know." As the shades of evening began to gather around, and the dampness of the grass reminded our friends of the necessity   KATE STANTON.           163 of the utmost caution, and careful management towards their suffering friend, Kate was gently' raised in their arms, and as gently borne into the house, where Mrs. Maxwell had fur- nished the sofa with all that was requisite for ease and repose for the invalid. c"Who is that coming this way?" asked Sarah. ( I won- der if she is coming in?-yes-no-yes, here is indeed Mrs. Bentley." "O dear!" said Charles. "O dear, indeed!" murmured Kate. The various ejaculations of "c O dear," and the cause there- for, are best explained as the individual, on whose account they were uttered, herself entered the house for an afternoon call. She was a sort of town nurse, whom everybody employed, and who, indeed, expected to be called upon whenever she could be of use as midwife, nurse, or undertaker, to any and every one. She never took money or pay for her services, but did not refuse to receive presents when offered by those whom she had served. She was a goodly dame, of no particular age, but still able to stump about, thoughl so portly and abounding in flesh that it often did excite some surprise how she did it. This afternoon she appeared in pretty good case, and per- haps neatly dressed. but such an admixture of old and new fashion in her style, as to render it extremely doubtful to what generation,-old, young, or middle-aged, she belonged.   -Her bonnet was of black silk, wide, and certainly large J   enough for two heads instead of one to find shelter in, were it  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6993-00000083"/> 164         ATE5T TANTON not that it was so full of bright flowers that two heads might crush them. Her dress, which was extremely short-waisted, was also of silk, but a color between a pink and a yellow,- if anybody can tell what that degree of shading deserves to be called, - and so short that her pantalets were fully visi- bl, while her large feet were crowded into a pair of very small morocco shoes. On her armn she carried a full-stuffed bag, and in her hands, not on them, a pair of light thread gloves, besides the usual accompaniments of sunshade, fan, and snuff-box; and this the tout ensemble. Having thus described our lady, let her enter the room where the family are seated, where Kate is reclining, and where nobody wishes to see her, but must, lest she be offended; and to offend such a woman would offend the town aye and aye; and all chance of salvation, according to her notions of Christianity, would be blown to the four winds, also, for aye and aye. ( Good-afternoon, Mrs. Bentley," said Mrs. Maxwell, kindly. "And good-afternoon IMrs. Maxwell," said Mrs. Bentley, in return. (Lay off your things, IMrs. Bentley," said Mrs. Maxwell. "O, I could n't, certainly; I've been out a calling this afternoon and can't stop a minute, but as I was agoing by thought I'd just drop in and say how d' ye do, and all that; and how is your darter to-day?" "O, I'rrm quite well, and at your service," said Sarah Max- well. "But I mean this other darter; this thin face here."

"No, no; spare her blushes, do," said Mrs. Bentley. "Is there much sickness in town, ma'am?" "There be considerable just now, and specially among chil- dren; the scarlet fever 's round some, and quite serious, too, though a'n't none on 'em died yet, as I know on." "I suppose you would know if any had," said IMrs. Max- well. "Why, yes; there 's nobody born nor buried in these parts without I have something to do in the -matter, and have done these thirty years; yes, these five and thirty years!" "You are justly proud in saying so. I see that you are always busy in one way or another." "Yes, somebody must be around, sort of handy you know, where there 's any goings on."  I know you are always ready and willing with a helping hand; but are you never afraid of contagion?" t"La, no ma'am!

"Mrs. Towne has met wsith a sad loss in her daughter," said Mrs. Maxwell. Yes, ma'am; I was there, and I always say she did n't die  right; and if I 'd 'a been in Mrs. Towne's shoes, I 'd had that there tomb watched a week, before I 'd given it up so easy like," said Mrs. Bentley. W What do you mean?" "Why, ma'am, I was there, and I closed her eyes myself, and was n't she the prettiest corpse ever I laid hands on? and I say slhe did n't die as she ouglht 'a done, by a long ways!" Is there any one way to die??" "Lord, zooks, yes, there is, now! She ought to have sort 'a stopped breathing, and then 'a gone on and breathed three times, before she passed away." "Is that necessary?" asked Mrs. Maxwell. "I think so, ma'am, and you know I have had some expe- rience in that line; and it seldom fails when they finally die." "Don't you think Sarah Towne was really dead?" asked Sarah Maxwell. "I would n't like to tell my thoughts, miss; but if I was 'a going to take my Bible oath, I 'd 'a said that Sally Towne was a live girl after I closed her eyes; and if she did die then, she did n't go out with the tide as she ought 'a done." Strange notion this -and yet how very prevalent is this opinion among old nurses and watchers, that the sick person dies generally when the tide goes out! In the present in- stance, when Sarah Towne lay to all appearance dying, early .   KATE STANTON.          167 in the morning, the whole family,--father, mother, two sisters, and brother-in-law, himself a physician, --standing sadly grouped around the bedside, and this old beldame hov- ering there too, with her solemnly-knowing eyes glancing around to see what these others were doing, she would ever and anon grasp the sick girl's hand, and then chafe her bosom, and, as she appeared insensible, say, in a voice loud and chill- ing enough to be heard by all, "She 's dying, ma'am; she 's going with the tide!" She had probably consulted the alma- nac that morning, as she always carried one in her pocket. But she did not die with that tide; the water ebbed and flowed again, and still found her living, though senseless; and, as each time came for the turning of the tide, this old woman, this learned old woman, would ejaculate, "Well, she 'll go" with this tide sure!" For the benefit of the knowing ones, it may be well to state that Sarah Towne did die as the tide was coming in, not going out, "Mrs. Towne went often to the tomb, I heard," said Mrs. Maxwell. "She did, ma'am, she did; and Mr. Call, the sexton, told me that she had the coffin opened every day for a week ;.and I should 'a been worried myself, for the features hardly changed; but, la'atn, she was a pretty corpse " This was about as much as Sarah Maxwell could bear, and she was obliged to leave the room for a while, for change of thought, at least.

"Has she gone?" asked Sarah Maxwell, just peeping into the room. ( She has," said her mother. ( I am glad of it, then, I am sure. HoI-o did you bear it, Kate?"

Be quick, though; the Charlie has just passed down the street," said Dick. No bolt was quicker and more noiselessly drawn than that of the side door already mentioned; and, in another moment, the two men were side by side, and the door again fast as before. "Now, Dick, we 'll have a time of it here! It is Saturday night, and we need not be in a hurry; first of all, supper ' ready." "What do you mean, you old gallows-joker?" "I mean that I have become fat and lean again during the last few hours; that is, I stuffed my clothes full of all sorts of eatables before I came this way, and I 've made a clean skin of it since. Look there," said Burton, pointing to a table that stood in a dark corner of the room, and cautiously mov- ing his dark lantern for the purpose. "How did you do this, Tom?" asked Dick Melcher. "Easy enough, I assure you. I learned a week ago that the porter was sick, and I engaged myself to take his place till he should recover, and, as it is typhus fever, I knew there was no hurry about his getting well. I was disguised so that young Maxwell did not know me, though I was tarnally afraid he would; but he has n't." H    "t But you don't keep the keys?" "No; the boy locks up, and carries the keys to the book- keeper's house.

So, as soon as it was dark, I slipped off to the cellar, and presently heard the click of the locks; then said I to myself, ' All right, Tom Burton, all rirht; ' and that's all about it." IIa! ha! ha! Tom Burton a porter, a lumper! ha! ha! ha! I say, ' Burton take this to the post-office; Burton, take this up to my house, and tell Mrs. Fussell I shall dine at the club; Burton, sweep out this room; Burton, have you been to the- the- the '-- anywheres and everywheres?"

"Here's a bag of money, tolerably heavy; lay that in the pile to go; it may take cold to remain here over Sunday."

A   ood round jump tough, Tom; but lere goes it, when you say the word," said Dick. ", Take the plunder, then, while I take the tools; but, first, let me scratch a card, as the theatre folks say, to the book- keeper." This done, our worthies, without more ado, gently dropped themselves and luggage from the rear window most in the shade, and, as this opened on a back passage-way, it as quite safe for their purpose.

I have a smart-sailing craft just outside the light, and a good gang of men; their time and duty paid for, and no questions asked; a good cabin to ourselves, and victuals and drink in plenty, for a merry cruise. Where do you want to put for, Tom?" "For Hiavana, of course. Eh, Dick?" "Nothing short of it, at any rate, Tom."' An hour's rowing brought our adventurers to a small fishing-smack; and a few moments more only elapsed when the anchor weighed. The party were now, for the time being, safe. As Sam informed his principals, he had chartered this smack for an excursion to Cuba; and so plausible was his story, and the tide at three o'clock in the morning so fair, and wind in the right quarter, that the skipper, though he had some mis- givings of their object, determined that it was none of his business to complain, so he was paid for his trouble; and ac- cordingly trimmed his craft for the work in hand. "Lock that door!" said Tom, as he with Dick Melcher w,  nand Sam Swallow (three precious-knaves) entered the cabin. The door locked, and all quiet, Tom, who, be it remem- bered, acted as principal in this night's adventures, - as indeed he did on all occasions of the kind,--produced the plunder he had brought with him, and which he now counted out, with the assistance of the other two. ,4  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6993-00000090"/> 178        KATE STANTON. The bag of specie contained in gold, and all in half and quarter eagles, five thousand dollars; having been drawn the day before from the bank, to pay custom-house duties with, but, for some reason or other, had not been applied thus ;-- while the wallet, containing bills and memoranda, counted of sufficient amount to defray the skipper's charge; and, as these, being only current in New England, were very service- able in this respect, and of no use in Havana, Burton decided to place them aside for that purpose. The package of papers, as has been said, that was marked for ftture reference, was found to contain sundry govern- ment land-warrants, surveys of land, and claims properly en- dorsed, and all in readiness to be executed; a few stock certificates in railroad and bank-stock, but of little or no value to those who had so surreptitiously obtained them; and the remainder consisted of a number of letters, to be spoken of hereafter. And now the package of deeds and mortgages, already men- tioned, was untied, and placed before the scoundrels for ex- alination and investigation. rhe first paper that met their eyes was a bill of sale and deed of the store in Boston. This they burned, as being of * no value to them, involving no safe course for obtaining possess- ion. The next paper, a deed of gift of sundry lands, free- holds, and such like, somewhere in the State of Georgia, and voted worthless, was also burned. The next, a bond for a deed of a tract or parcel of land in Medway, for future occu- pancy; decided to be burned. The next, the only paper copy of an origiuda purchase of the Indians, of a tract of land in N., which Burton decided to lay by for his own " investigation."   AATE STANTO    .       171 Next was found a deed of no special importance to til present narrative; but, lastly, was discovered a paper contain. ing a will, and described as the last will and testament of an old and valued friend of Mr. Fussell, and which shall be more fully mentioned hercafter. Suffice it to say, that this latter document was seized slyly, and carefully concealed from his companions, by Burton himself. Having thus obtained possession of what Burton esteemed as the most valuable of the booty, and allotted to his compan- ions such parts as he least cared to be himself burdened with, and having also satisfied them with a certain amount of the specie, he adjourned, as he said, " the present meeting," to decide in private how he might best put to account and his benefit the papers he had himself reserved. A few days of delightful weather and fast sailing brought the fishing-smack to the port of Havana, where the skipper lcft our adventurers, after having been fully recompensed for his time and trouble, and ireturned to pursue that vocation which this voyage had interrupted. Here then arrived at the island of Cuba three precious scoundrels, three notorious villains, that had long been a plague and annoyance to Boston and vicinity; and two of whom, as has been narrated, had partially served out a term in the state's special service.  After remaining a while at Havana, they took the cars for Guines, whence, after a short sojourn, marked only by a few minor criminalities, they again started, taking all the various towns en route to St. Jago de Cuba, at the further end of the island. And from this port they crossed to Port Maria in the island of Jamaica, where for the present we will leave them.

"STMrUOARD your helm!" cried Captain Fussell, in a voice like thunder. "' Hard to starboard; jam her down; all hands mnake ready to take in sail; let every man be on the alert, then work with a will!" So spoke Captain Pussell; and every man on board the Adrian knew that voice, and obeyed it with alacrity. That morning had the ship made little progress on her hlomeward course; by the captain's reckoning, the vessel was about half-way from Halifax, in course for Boston. A dead calm had succeeded a number of days of steady winds, and all was as silent as death. Along the horizon was seen a little cloud, so small that to an unpractised eye it seemed to mean nothing, and to lie there, and form the only exception to what might have been called a cloudless sky. Not a breeze fluttered a sail; the little pennon at the mast-head hung listlessly, lazily down against the mast, like a tired thing, not strong enough to stir itself. That cloud, to the eye of the experienced seaman, was ful!   KATE STANTON.          181 fraught with danger and peril. The mariner saw in that bit of vapor the seed of a tempest and a storm; and the very stillness of the atmosphere seemed to him but the forerunner Alp}  and precursor of a wild hurricane. Lk    The ship lay like a log upon the water; scarce a ripple seemed to ruffle its glassy surface, and scarcely a yard of pro-  gress did that gallant vessel make in lessening her distance from home. The morning passed away, and with it the calm also. That cloud rose higher in the heavens; the wind began to blow with an intensity that put life and animation into every heart on board; but, as the sun passed the meridian, the wind became higher, and blew with more force, and the little cloud became larger and blacker, arid, ere the sun went down, the whole face of the heavens was changed. The sky was black, and, save a bright streak along the horizon, all* was dark; and anon that bright streak became black and gloomy with the rest. The thunder rolled portentously, and the bright lightning flashed. The creaking of the rigging, and the hurried, though deter- ::    mined command of the captain, plainly showed that the ex- pected strife of the elements was at hand. No pains were spared, no exertion omitted, which experience and caution suggested were necessary to place the ship in a condition and position to cope and grapple with a powerful antagonist. Captain Fussell was everywhere, doing everything that an ex- perienced mariner should do when winds blow fiercely, and the low-muttering and distant thunder too plainly tells him that something special is about to happen. The sails were all taken in but the top-sails; and, as the 16 it                     ',47s  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6993-00000092"/> 182        KATE STANTON. storm arose, these were split and torn to ribbons. The sea was white with foaml, and dashed mountains high; the huge waves rolled over the deck, and, for an hour, it seemed doubt- ful which momentt would be the last to that ship's crew. As night closed in, the storm abated; but, all night long, a double watch was kept on board, and not an eye was closed in sleep. The second morning dawned, and the second evening closed, and the third morning dawned, and again the storm arose, and the winds blew again with increased rigor. The ship had during the interval made much headway, and the captain was in hopes to reach his port in safety before the elements were again at war together. In this, however, he was doomed to be disappointed. Towards noon of the third day the wind suddenly shifted, the dirge-like air-wailings increased, and it seemed as though every wind at once had been let loose upon the ocean. Again rose the waves, and onward tossed the ship in its maddening career. Fiercer and fiercer blew the wind, and none but a seaman knows what a storm at sea is, and it was then terrible in- deed. The vessel rolled and pitched; the darkness came on; and then arose the dreadful cry of "A man overboard!"No earthly arm could save him, as none could then check the course of the ship. The sailors threw overboard whatever of her coops and other lumber they could reach; but the waves closed over him, and he was lost in them forever! ( A man overboard! a man overboard!"  O, shout of s hout$ at sea the saddest! And now at night, each one I  , p   'ATE  STANTON          1 183 :i   peers through the gathering darkness strivi that little band has gone to his lastto see who 'o         whoe fat  r  il d   asn account; to see whose widow, whose fatherless children must receive the sad news ,oftheir bereavement when the vessel shall arrive in port.

"( Joy, O joy " cried Ellen; but again had Miss Everson fainted, for she had become so anxious that, till now, her in- tense feelings had buoyed her up; but since exertion seemed no longer necessary, she had yielded with her failing strength. "Whom have I to thank?" said Captain Fussell, coming towards the group that were now busy around Miss Everson. "Whom shall I thank for this timely deliverance?" "If your thanks are due anywhere," said the old skip- per, "they are due to this young lass, who is captain of my boat for the trip, and, indeed, the projector of our plan." "What! women on such a morning, and on such an errand! and whom do I see? - not - surely - not - Clara!" "Yes, your own Clara," said Miss Everson, at once aroused at hearing her lover's voice; " and I thank God you are alive to hear me say so; and here, too, is another who has shared our rescue party," and Ellen rushed into his arms. "Thanks, indeed, beloved ones! hut how came you here?" "A brother you, and ask us that?" !:i"A lover you, and ask us that?"

Be it well and truly remembered that Pandora's box was quickly closed when disease after disease had flown out into tihe world; and even the proverbial curiosity of her sex did not tempt her again to raise the lid, for behind, and fluttering also to get loose, and shake off confinement and shackles, was Hope. Kate and William found a new home for themselves, and, according to previous arrangements, William was welcomed to the store of our friends, Fussell &amp; Maxwell. "I La lpleased, my lad," said Mr. Fussell, "to welcome You aMth1o  us in our busy hive. A mercantile life is not a bed of' roses, and the life of a boy in a store not one where he can have reason to expect much that is otherwise than lab)orious and full of toil; but we desire to make your path with us as pleasant as may be under the circumstances. i "We are not of those who believe that the knowledge our clerks obtain from us while in our employ is an equivalent to their services rendered. Too many youths have suffered from such course, where the remuneration has not been equal to the labor bestowed. Too many have been the cases where a bright youth has entered a store with the understanding that his services were to be paid with the knowledge he would surely gain; and, unless the poor fellow had in his pocket ' the wherewithal to keep the devil away,' he often faltered, 1and, alas, too often fell! !"Few can pursue an apprenticeship, in any business, even with the strongest principles at heart that may be inculcated, without feeling a want, and a reaching forward to obtain what   RIATIE STANTON  189 may be almost in his grasp; and although we are of the old school in mercantile affairs, no clek inur employ ever has or ever shall labor for us without receiving a fair remu- with us, as long as you properly attend to all duties assigned to you; and now go you among your fellows here, who will show you what is to be done, and how." -And now, behold our William, fairly entered upon his duties Surrounded with temptations on ever  d pn his duties, -with -xed principles in his breast -pinciples a mother placed there and nurtured; and shall he falter and fall?

They were by no means an cxceptiofn in this respect. A blight had fallen in the family circle of Mr. Fussell. His helpmate, his household partner, was at length stricken down. Full of years, her mission accomplished, her sand was slowly running out. The silver cord was loosened, the golden bowl was broken, t  pitcer broken at the fountain, the grasshopper had become a burden, and her soul as prepar- ing to return to Him who gave     eallotted 1cr life, which had been lengthened out beyond the all e threesroe years and ten, hhad been one of comparative ease and pleasantness. asving been reared in the lap of luxury and pleasantness.  un,        littlBuffering, and and refinement, she had exprince but littl e uffe ar- Time had ever dealt gently with her. ontrastig her char- acter with that of her liberal husband, she did not really well sustain the test; but hers seemed inborn, and elling in her heart, though her nature was quite kind and indulgent. her heart, though her i  ;;^    k  this ay have As has been remarled, Be    of, pherr As     1- been the fault of years, rather than of character, as her chil- dren had imbibedl no such sentiments of immoderate frugality or parsimony.

Gathered around her couch were her aged partner, Mro Fussell, her two daughters, Ellen and Marianne; her son Mar- tin, and his friend and affianced Clara Everson. It seemed well that this sad event, the departure of the wife and mother, should take place when she could be thus surrounded by children and husband. It seemed fitting that she should die at home, where all her happiest years had been passed, where her family had been born and reared. "My dear children, I know you all," said she, and a faint smile for a moment lit up that wan and wasted countenance; "and I thank God that he has permitted me to know you all i once more on earth, before I go to meet you again in the heavenly mansion above. And you, my dear husband, I know you, and only regret my dying will leave you so much alone in these your latter years.

"Dear mother," said Ellen, " give yourself no. pain on that subject. We, your children, have rather to ask of you pardon and forgiveness for our many faults, and for the trouble we have always caused you; but, dear mother, we have never intended to be ungrateful, nor forgetful of your kindness and care." "No, mother," said Marianne, " we feel that our lives have not always been devoted to see what we could best render you as a requital for your long solicitude for our happiness; but for all the wrong and trial we have ever cost you, we do humbly ask that you will not pass away unforgiving." "i( y dear girls, afflict not yourselves on my account, and mourn not for yourselves. I do not think of you as ungrate- ful. You may have at times been thoughtless; but it was only the thoughtlessness of your childhood, not of your ma- turer years. I die satisfied with your conduct towards me. Preserve ever towards each other those sentiments of love and affection most pleasing in God's all-seeing eye, and I can ask no more." "( And you, my dear Martin, my only surviving son, in bidding you good-by, I would that we had been better ac- quainted with each other. I would like to have had your pro- fession one that would have retained you at home; but as that was not to be, it is probably as wQll as it is.

Look at these girls, my boy; they want some one to look after them. 3My dear children, I am growing weaker, and can say little more. I am only thankful that I have been permitted to say as much as I have, and been able to take a leave of you.

"Be quiet, miss, or I 'll put the ruffles on to you!" "What's the row, Charlie?" asked a pleasant-voiced gen- tleman, whom the contest brought up. "One of the common stamp, doctor; the old story."  "Dr. Beach!" cried the girl franticly. 17*  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6993-00000100"/> 198        KATE STANTON.  "Surely I know that voice; but no-it can't be; but - yet  it seems very familiar too - Kate - Kate Stanton!" 1 It is you, doctor! O, save me from this man, who has mistaken my calling'!" "And what wonder he should, Miss Stanton, since you fall in his way, and at such an hour too; but let her be, Charlie, I will answer for her myself, and I am sure you can trust me." "That I will, and glad to be rid of her so easy," said the watchman, as he sauntered onward. "Now, Kate, what does this mean, that I find you in such a plight, and at such a time? It is lucky I was rung out of bed to-night, or your face would have worn a strange appear- ance in Court-square in the morning." O, doctor, am I crazy? Perhaps I am; but this head is almost ready to burst. I've watched and waited the whole night for William to come home, and when the clock struck two, I could bear it no longer, and came out to seek him." "Poor girl! Where did you indeed intend to go, had not that watchman arrested your steps?" "I should have gone first to the store, and, failing of finding him there, should have wandered the night long, or what remains of i itin search of him." "Exactly so ; and that 's all folly, Kate. Let me escort you home, and then, wlien I have visited my patient, I will go to the store myself; so calm yourself, child, since you can do no better, - and if I hear anything I will return." "If I must, I must; but, O, doctor - " "I know all about it, poor thing. I know all you would say; but it 's no use doing as you were. The watchman won't i   KATE STANTON.          199 believe your story, and some station-house would soon hold you, where you would have to remain till daylight; and all you could say would avail you little with the gentleman that presides at the court-house. Believe me, I do not seek to trifle with your sufferings ; but let me heal of no more night- wanderings, as I may not be always near when I'mn wanted." Kate thanked her kind friend, as, with tearful eyes and throbbing heart, she reached her door, safe from her perilous walk; and, throwing herself into her chair once more, sobbed as if her heart would break from its fastenings. "O, William, my dear brother! if you only knew, if I only knew" -and, sobbing and sighing, she mourned the night away, for sleep was not in her thoughts With the morning light she rose, and after a hurried break- fast, and a vain attempt to wash away the sad effects of her night's vigil, she sallied forth once more, taking the doctor's house in her course. Dr. Beach kindly offering to escort her, she accepted his proffered arm. He had no news to tell her, and, having found all quiet at the store, he had not called again on Kate. Thither, however, they now repaired, feeling that at least they could there gain some intelligence; and the tale tiey there heard did little towards brightening poor Kate's prospects. Entering the inner counting-room, they found Mr. Fussell there alone, and he looked up sadly on their entrance. It was not necessary for Kate to ask any question, for she read on that old man's brow that something was wrong there, which he hesitated to make known. Gently closing the door, and closing also the ground glass  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6993-00000101"/> 200        K ATE STANTON. sashes, and inviting his early visitors to be seated, Mr. Fussell began: "I regret, Miss Stanton, to be the one on whom it now devolves to tell you a sad piece of intelligence, and I had rather it should remain unsaid; but I would not further em- bitter your wounded heart by cruel suspense, where even the truth, once said, might relieve your anxiety, though it will heighten your trouble, and enhance the grief you are now suffering. I would have sent to you last evening, but I had not the heart to speak even to you; and IMr. Maxwell, n:y partner, felt it even worse than I did. 4 Suffice it, then, to say, that we have discovered a discrep- ancy in the cash transactions of the store, which demanded a careful investigation, in order to place the responsibility of the matter on the person n whom it belonged, and to ex- onerate the guiltless from all possible appearance of blame. "In doubt and uncertainty, we questioned every clerk in our employ, but each one singly and alone, and as privately as we are now holding this conference. The conclusion to -hich we have arrived is this: your brother, as one of his duties, has done our banking business, taking the book daily from the hands of our cash clerk, making the deposit, and returning the book when made.  (i Yesterday being the beginning of the month, our book, returned from the bank as usual, was found to vary one thousand dollars fromn our figures, and from the margin of our  check-book. Knowing that something was wrong, our clerk showed me the entries, and checking off each item marked  where the difference had occurred, and the day when. This  done, and with care too, I questioned your brother, and he at ,        ,n   KATE  STANTON.         201 once denied all knowledge of the matter. My clerk, in whom I place the highest and most perfect confidence, asserts that the items of deposit, on leaving our store, in the book were perfectly correct. The bank clerk and the teller both assure us that the cash of the bank is correct. "This is a long account, Miss Stanton; but the inference is plain, that your brother is the guilty party in the trans- action!" "Mr. Fussell!" cried Kate, " it cannot be, I know. I can fully exonerate him--his character is pure--he is gold itself! Where is he? O, let me go to him, and at once!" "We have found it necessary," continued Mr. Fussell, "to place him in confinement until he can undergo a legal examination." "In confinement!" shrieked the girl. "In jail do you mean?" "( I do, Miss Stanton; though I grieve to say it." This was enough. Poor Kate swooned in the fulness of her agony. Dr. Beach strove to restore her. "I would have spared her this, friend Fussell. I, too, be- lieve her brother to be innocent." "It may be so; but evidences are much against such belief. The examination is to take place this afternoon." "This afternoon, say you? I would I could be present, but my engagements will not permit of it; but look you, Fussell, if the lad is committed for trial, name me as his full bail for any amount the judge wants and the case demands. O heavens, that it has come to this! I would sooner have believed myself the guilty one. Let one of your young men  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6993-00000102"/> 202        KATE STANTON. get a carriage for our young sufferer here. My chaise is broken, and I 'm a-foot to-day; else my horse should lend his aid." A carriage was soon procured - the poor unconscious girl  was lifted in - the doctor followed. i"You shall hear from me to-morrow," said the doctor; and to the driver, "Quick to be sure now to street, and your fare shall be doubled." Away rolled the carriage, -for even hack-horses can be hurried when money drives them, - and the passengers were again landed; but this time at the doctor's mansion. "Lend a hand here, Nancy!" cried the doctor. "This case needs your kind offices more than mine now, and do your best." Here, then, true to her nature, Nancy threw aside, for the time at least, all those eccentric and unwomanly airs, which had usually marred her better appearance, and, with that de- votion of spirit for which she was remarkable, gave all her attention to the feeble girl, who slowly revived. Where am I?" said Kate, awakening as it were from a deep sleep. "low came I here? Ah! I remember all now, and William is in-- I cannot, cannot say the word. Dear, dear doctor, tell me, my best friend, do you think William guilty of this wrong he is charged with?"  "I do not, Kate; but it really looks dark, and that clerk swears to the tickets he made up his accounts with, and cannot be moved,-he seems as oburate as a very pagan. Keep up a good heart, Kate; it is ever the darkest just before daylight; and who indeed knows what may come out of this gloom? How do you feel now, my dear?"   KATE STANTON.          203 Very weak and feeble," returned Kate, as she sighed. ' 1My strength seems indeed gone." "Rest you here then till evening, when I hope to bring you better news." "God grant it, doctor! Any news should be good news, for I can bear none other now." "Be a woman!" whispered Nancy encouragingly. "I will try, indeed," said Kate; "but, O, how can I nerve myself in this struggle, - my poor brother in confinement, and I not by his side to cheer and to soothe him in his sadness and grief!" "I trust," said the doctor, "to bring him to you to-night, if I may be admitted as his bail; as, during your swoon, Mr. Fussell said he would be brought to court this afternoon for examination and investigation, and, should the clerk then swear as positively as he now does, your brother will of ne- cessity be committed for a regular trial; but I will get him home, Kate. I will get him here, and you shall clasp him to your arms, and he shall stay here, or with you, till the trial comes on. This I pledge myself, Kate." "O, thank you, thank you, doctor! God reward you, my friend, for all your thoughtfulness and attention to the lonely and the suffering." "Why, Kate," said the doctor, blubbering in spite of him- self, " what else could I do?" Kate rushed into his arms. Did she refuse a kiss now, think you? Slowly and drearily wore that day away. Kate, feeble and exhausted by her emotions, reclined upon the sofa; and, during the doctor's absence with his engagements, his faithful  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6993-00000103"/> 204       KATE  STANTON. sister tenderly soothed her; and, as evening approached, together they listened to the sound of vehicles as they passed and repassed, in the hope that one at least would stop.  They had not long to wait. First came the doctor's chaise, just repaired, and looking as bright and new as possible, and  out jumped the doctor. Kate said nothing, but her eye sought his imploringly. "I  have not been to the court-room," said her fiiend; "but I made arrangements to have our boy here, and -"         I "Here they are!" said Nancy, as a hack drove by the window, and stopped at the door. Kate roused herself from her reclining, and her strength seemed returning for the occasion, as presently the parlor-  door opened, and in walked Mr. Fussell, and with him  William.  Pale as death itself, and sad as sad could be, he approached  his sister, and took her hand, but doubtingly. At a sign from  the doctor, he with the others left the room; and now our young friends were left together.  William doubtingly looked in his sister's face. She raised  her eves to his; a faint smile lit up her features, and in another mlollment the two were clasped in one close embrace;  and t thentheir .sobs were audible, mingling together in sad corn- mnunion. For a time not a word was spoken by either; but those hearts were speaking unutterable words. At length the long silence was broken. "Then you don't doubt me, Kate? You don't think me guilty of this charge?" "Never, O never, William! I would I might die first, and be indeed with our mother on high, if I could be thus   KATE STANTON.          205 permitted, rather than live toa. think I had a - for a brother!" "O, Kate, I thought much of you all last night, and I prayed that my innocence might become known to you and the world. I felt that you certainly would acquit me in your heart; though I did not know but that some might poison you with reflections upon myself, and that was why I was uncer- tain just how you would receive me to-night." "Dear William, we have both been sufferers, O, great suf- ferers! but how much more, how much greater, our pain and unhappiness, had you been untrue!" "' But, Kate, I am not yet proved innocent. Mr. Curtis swears to the correctness of his accounts, and I am to-day committed for trial at the next term of the court. Mr. Fussell arranged my bail between himself and Dr. Beach; and thus am I allowed to see you to-night." "(Something tells me, William, that you are innocent of this charge; but if you are guilty-" "Guilty, Kate! Do you express any doubt of my inno-. cence? O my sister, when the time comes that you, my only love, can doubt the sincerity of my conduct and behavior; when the hour arrives that you can point the finger of scorn at me, and say with truth, ' There goes one who is not to be trusted;' then, indeed, may I sink into nothing, and be as though I had never been! Your counsel and my own inno- cence buoy me up under every trial and difficulty." "M y dear brother, I do not think you guilty; but, O, this aching head has suffered much during the last eighteen hours, and although you are found again, yet my nerves are all unstrung." 18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6993-00000104"/> 20()       KATE STANTON. Supper was now announced; and the good doctor, entering the room once more, welcomed our young friends to the social board. Certainly they felt little like eating in their mutual grief; but they could not slight the doctor's good cheer. Mr. Fussell excused himself on the ground of his family be- reavement, and had already departed for his gloomy and melancholy home. Together, then, the party seated themselves, and Nancy did the table honors. "3Mr. Fussell bids me say," said the doctor, "that, under the present circumstances, you will be excused from attendance at the store, till your innocence shall be made manifest. This of course you expected, and cannot, therefore, be disappointed. In the mean time, I can give you employment here. My papers want attention; my books need posting, and now, just at this time, my bills must be made out. It you will aid in these matters, you shall have the same, salary that the firm were paying you; and you need devote no more hours to the occupation than you have been accustomed to heretofore." William heartily thanked him; and our Kate, smiling through her tears, like a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day, re- iterated his heartfelt acknowledgments. At the close of the meal a carriage was at the door, and in a very short time Kate and her brother were once more at home. It were needless to relate what little occurred from this period to the time of William's trial. He went daily to the doctor's office, and there did everything to the pleasure and satisfaction of his new employer; while his sister Kate,   KATE STANTON.          207 bed with hope, revived again as William's presence soothed her.  How fortunate is it for us, poor mortals, that we cannot view trouble and unhappiness in advance, but that blessed HOPE can animate and renew an otherwise sinking spirit, and raise in the mind bright images of happiness and delight! But all things must end, whether happiness and delight, or uncertainty, doubt and grief; and the day of days with Wil- liam, at length was at hand. Through the kindness of Dr. Beach a good and efficient counsel was obtained for William, and all necessary steps taken to be in readiness for the occasion. It came at last. The court-room was densely crowded with an attentive audience; William was placed in the prisoner's box,' and his sister was seated as near him as possible, and, as each word was uttered by the various dignitaries of the court, she kept her eyes alternately on the speaker and upon her brother, as if she would read in his face what emotion was passing there, and how the language was received, and its effect. The jury had come in and answered to their names; the indictment against the prisoner was read, charging him with having committed the crime of embezzlement from his em- ployers; in that, in various ways, manners, and so on, to embrace all possible grounds, he had withdrawn, taken, ab- stracted and. conveyed away from, and out of their bank- book, the sum of one thousand dollars, intrusted to him, with other funds, bills, drafts, and checks for deposit in --  Bank; said embezzlement, larceny, appropriation, theft, and the like, having taken place in the day-time, in the manner afore- said, in and during all the month of --.  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6993-00000105"/> 208       KATE STANTON. To this indictment William Stanton pleaded "not guilty." His sister stole a glance at his face, as he rose in his place to hear the indictment, and at its close she thought his reply was the very type of innocence, so manfully did he utter the words; while the officers of the court, too well accustomed to such replies, were as sure it was only an answer of bravado and cunning, rather than the words of a free and courageous heart. The witnesses for the prosecution were called, and the cash clerk mounted the stand. He swore positively that each day during the month he had placed the money, ready for depositing, in the hands of William Stanton, for delivery and deposit, and that, at the end of the month, when the book was examined, the deficit was discovered; that he had then checked off every item, both debt and credit, and that on a certain day, entered therein, he found it short from his figures one thousand dollars. He swore that his own cash balance was the correct one, as he kept his bank account on the margin of his check-book, deducting and adding as checks were drawn, or bills and checks deposited; that, as the balance in bank was always large, he never was notified of any over-draft in the account, and, consequently, as he pursued his own system, there was no necessity of referring to the bank-book much oftener than once a month, and then only when the book was returned, and the items checked off; outstanding checks were noted on his own check-book, and the balance again carried forward as -before. He swore, further, that no one but Stanton had made any deposit for the firm during the entire month, and he was the   KATE STANTON.          209 more sure of this, as their deposits were always made at a certain hour in the day, which was when William was on his way to dinner by way of State-street, at dne o'clock, when he always retained the book till he returned from dinner, and then placed it in the drawer, where it was always kept, at the desk. - The teller of the bank was sworn, and testified to the cor- rectness of his cash balance; that on the --  day of--- last, he received from Stanton, whom he now identified, a cer- tain sum of money in bills and checks; that the packages did not come out full count by one thousand dollars, that he de- ducted said one thousand dollars from the deposit-ticket, and entered the correct amount in the deposit-book; did not remember whether or not he informed Stanton that there was a variation; thinks he must have done so; is not sure, how- ever; it was his general rule to notify of all discrepancies; thought he could not then have varied from his general course. The deposit-ticket in question was here produced, and shown to the jury, with the deduction upon it as specified by the teller, and sworn to, as being his handwriting. The evidence of the teller, and also that of Mr. Curtis, the cask clerk, was clear and concise; some other witnesses were examined, but no new facts were developed, and here the side of the prosecution rested. For the defence a number of witnesses were produced, who testified to the good character of young Stanton; but nothing was brought forward that seemed in any way to contradict or controvert the testimony on the other side, which had been 18*  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6993-00000106"/> 2l10       IKATE STANTON. given with great clearness, and had also undergone a strict and careful cross-examination. The l]awyers on both sides closed their arguments, and sat down. There was evidently but one opinion in the court-room, and Doctor Beach, who sat by the side of Kate Stanton, could only whisper vain words of comfort, and sentiments of encour- agement which he certainly could not feel, except so far as his well-balanced mind swerved somewhat in favor of William, his protege and his hope. Kate pressed the good man's hand in return; she could not, she dared not, speak; her heart was full to bursting; her confidence in her brother was still unshaken and undis- turbed; she felt he was innocent, though every appearance was against him, and she would not yield. The venerable judge now rose to deliver to the jury his solemn charge. The jury rose as usual to attend. "Gentlemen of the jury: the case before you, as the in- dicttent has set forth, is one of embezzlement; embezzlement of property, embezzlement of money - of funds deposited and placed in the hands of the prisoner at the bar, for the purpose of depositing in the bank to the credit of his eml- ployers. That prisoner is young-not yet of age; but he has already arrived at an age of discretion, at an age when he knows, or indeed should know, the difference between right and wrong, and is able to judge between them. "He took the deposit-book from the hands of Mr. Curtis, the cash clerk of the firm by whom he was employed, with the understanding on Mr. Curtis' part that it was to be safely   KATE STANTON.          2" delivered at the bank, to which place it was destined. Of this, gentlemen of the jury, there is not the least shadow of doubt or uncertainty; the grand starting-point, then, gentle- men, is clear and indisputable--I mean the delivery of the book into the hands of the prisoner at the bar. "No one, gentlemen, has disputed the fact, or attempted to deny that when said book was delivered to Stanton, the amount contained therein was correct, and correctly stated upon the deposit-ticket which accompanied the money. i This is a strong point, gentlemen, and one I would of all others particularly impress upon your minds. I mean, gen- tlemen, the fact that the correct amount was delivered, and that the clerk's cash at the store was correct and vouched for. "(Ie tells you, gentlemen of the jury, that he is not in the habit of examining daily, after the bank-book is returned to him, as in the margin of the store check-book, and in his own handwriting, are the figures upon the accuracy of which he relies, with that certainty which the figures give him, that he is correct. Gentlemen, the testimony of Mr. Curtis has not been im- peached or doubted; it stands before you as he gave it, clearly, and with a straightforwardness which his professional duties of an accomplished and thorough accountant enabled him well to maintain. "His cash account, then, gentlemen, was correct, as his figures show. Here is the check-book, which has been the I    subject of some discussion here. You will observe the figures are distinct, well made, without blot or blemish; there have been here no scratching out, no erasures, no cross entries; the j   &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6993-00000107"/> 212        KATE STANTON. account is a fair one. He tells you, gentlemen, that the ac- count was a large one, and here you may see the balance this moment in bank. A goodly sum, indeed, gentlemen, and not drawn down even to the semblance of overdrawing. (4 Look next, gentlemen to the evidence of the teller of the bank. He informs you that he counted the packages daily, and that, on a certain day of the month in question, he found the ticket to vary one thousand dollars from the count of the cash clerk, Mr. Curtis. "He says he does not remember positively, gentlemen, whether he informed the defendant of the deficit and discrep- ancy; there is only reason to believe he did, from the fact, as he tells you, that it was his invariable custom so to do. "Errors are by no means rare, gentlemen,-would to Heaven they were - and often are the instances, of course, where the packages are found to vary, and must of necessity be altered and made to correspond with the amounts regis- tered on the straps, and also on the tickets. "The teller informs you, gentlemen, that his cash was also correct; and it is an exploded idea, gentlemen of the jury, that banks do not rectify errors when in favor of their custom- ers. This was said, as you all know, in former years; but the world has changed in this respect, and, if it has not grown wiser, there is every reason to hope it is better. "The teller, gentlemen, has a great responsibility on his shoulders; and, although there is often much slipping in high places and in stations of trust and responsibility, our witness must be believed, as he, too, stands unimpeached, and I trust unimpeachable. "I need not recapitulate, gentlemen, the testimony of the   KATE STANTON.          213 other witnesses, since there was nothing elicited from them which can in any way alter or change the evidence before you; but I proceed now, gentlemen of the jury, to examine the evidence of the defence. "There is nothing in this evidence that can falsify the statements already given. There is no contradiction, by any witness, of any fact thus far elicited. "The defence bases its whole column of argument upon the previous good character of the prisoner at the bar. A good character, gentlemen, is priceless,-more precious than rubies, and will sometimes sparkle with more brilliancy than the diamond itself; it is indeed, gentlemen, the diamond of life; and it will glow with yet the greater radiancy and fervor amid the darkest clouds of suspicion and distrust! "They tell you, gentlemen, he has borne a good character. Gentlemen, has there been one of the number of embezzle- ments and breaches of trust, that have been developed and brought to the light of day, during the past year-has there been one, where the defendant has not been called a man of good character? !"But I would not detract, gentlemen, one jot or tittle from his good character till the present instance. "The defence tells you, gentlemen, that the prisoner is an orphan, or believed to be, and asks your sympathies on this regard. "Gentlemen of the jury: this is no time nor place for sympathy. Your business is with the evidence before you, and your sympathies must be smothered and subdued! "Did I wish to summon forth your sympathies, I would point your attention to that weeping sister, who is here before  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6993-00000108"/> 214        KA TE STANTON. you.  I would picture her to you in all the loveliness of heart fondness; her true and sincere affection for her brother; her watchfulness over his interest. And you who have sisters, dear household treasures, yet clinging to your hearth-stones, and twining in fondness and truth around your family tree, should have each and all of them brought before you here in imagination, and sympathy should win for them where the law and evidence fail! "But, gentlemen, here your business is with the evidence, and on the evidence must rest your verdict. If you are satis- fied that the defendant received the funds said to have been committed to his charge, and if you are also as satisfied that they were not deposited in bank, as tendered to him for that purpose, then you must enter your verdict as guilty of the crime of embezzlement. Let no sympathies for the prisoner have any weight with your verdict; but, as I have already said, base it upon the law and the evidence, justified by the oaths you have taken, and on this law and evidence alone!" The judge ended and took his seat. All was silence in the court-room, save the ordinary bustle occasioned by the depart- ure of the officer with the jury. The judge took up the newspaper; one lawyer, with cat-like tread, passed across the room, to converse with another, the newspaper reporters sat back in their chairs and yawned; the parties most interested occasionally exchanged glances with each other--and what glances! - full of hopelessness and anxiety. Kate visibly trembled; and William, although he felt his case was lost, yet maintained a firm front, that consciousness of innocence alone can acquire.   A E STANTON.          215 "Bear up, Miss Stanton," gently whispered Dr. Beach. "Bear up now - put on all your fortitude. With the return of the jurors rests your brother's fate; and, from the judge's charge, it is easy enough to see how they will render their verdict!" Those twelve men entered--the reporters resumed their pens in readiness - the wandering lawyers regained their seats, and all was silent. "Gentlemen of the jury! Have you agreed upon your verdict? The prisoner at the bar-is he guilty, or not guilty?" "Guilty!" said the foreman, A slight rustling is heard in the court-room - poor Kate had swooned --the doctor caught her in his arms. William, forgetful of self, of the place, of his situation, of the verdict, of everything, attempted to dart forward to reach her; but he was gently put back by the officer who attended by his side. While the doctor was endeavoring to restore her to con- sciousness, the judge thus addressed his prisoner: "You, William Stanton, prisoner at the bar, have been tried by this court, and the jury have now brought in their verdict against you of guilty of embezzlement; of converting to your own use, unlawfully, a certain sum of money, to you intrusted for a special purpose; that purpose you knew well was to deposit in the bank, where your employers did their business and kept their account. "Had you not been a common carrier, the law is the same. It has become somewhat common, of late, to term such matters  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6993-00000109"/> 216        KATE STANTON. breaches of trust, and they have been rarely awarded the amount of penalty they deserve. "Yet the crime is the same, and it is necessary the court should make an example of the offender, that justice may not appear to have grown slack upon this subject. For you to have committed this offence against society, is not very remarkable, except that, at your age, you may not be hardened in guilt; for such breaches of trust have become, alas! too common in this community. ("At the expiration of your sentence, it is to be hoped you will come forth with a determination to become a better man, and a more useful member of society, which, by this wrong that you have committed, is necessarily outraged. "( In accordance with the laws of this commonwealth, for suA cases made and provided, the court awards to you the term of two years imprisonment in the county jail!" And then, -yes, reader, and THEN! Will a year's confinement in a jail make an innocent man a wiser or a better citizen? IIow many, alas, who have passed that period in the county jail, come out from thence proper members of society?  But this is no part of ours; we enter on no controversial questions, but would merely proceed with our tale as it is, without varnishing or any other coloring than the lights and shadows of the real facts may give to the subject. "And, then," thought William, as he heard the sentence through to the end, and fell, rather than sat, down on his seat once more, " farewell to home, and friends, and society! If an innocent one cannot be believed, if this circumstantial evidence, so hard against me, must be my condemnation, who   KATE  STANTON.         217 knows what kind of a fellow I shall be when next I issue olth, say two years hence, intQ the broad free light of day? Who will employ me then?" A soft voice seemed to whisper in his ear "Hope!" So sure was he that he heard a voice, that he raised his head; but no, was he mistaken? The court was adjourning, the officer was by his side, ready to conduct him to his new home; but he at least, with all the roughness which usage had taught him, yet retained a feeble spark of human feeling. The officer-that seeminly hard man--was himself trying to conceal an emotion with his coat-sleeve. His heart was speaking, and though he could not struggle with and contend against his dUty, yet he was unnerved, and he it was who whispered " hope " in the ear of the poor forsaken one. Yes, hope! sacred blessing of God to suffering and forlorn humanity. Iope! endowing the mind and heart with all that is left to make him shun the evil one! Yes, hope! that ray of divinity, that remnant of life's pleasures, when the world grows dark and dim!. William glanced around the room, and in that sweeping glance saw enough to give him evidence of the state of feeling existing in that officer's breast. Doctor Beach was endeavoring to rouse poor Kate, that she might say one word to her brother ere he was conveyed from her sight; and for this one word was the officer waiting. Kind fellow! had more of your class your feelings, then pris- oners, guilty or not guilty, were' less forlorn; and that h-ope of which you whispered might inspire them with ambition to improve, and to live down their shame! 19  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6993-00000110"/> 218        KATE  STANTON. At length was Kate awakened to herself, and to perceive the real loneliness of her situation. '"O," said she on advanc- ing with feeble steps where William staid to say "' good-by," O, that I could change places with you!  O, William, I know you are innocent!" it God knows I am so, Kate; but I must submit for a time to this punishment. It may in some way work round aright once more. "One thing assures me, in the prospect of living alone the next two years, that I can suffer no pang of remorse for wrong done; but it distresses me to see you looking thus, dear Kate. God alone can comfort you now!" "Dear, dear brother, good-by!" He pressed her once and again to his breast, then allowed himself to be conveyed away to his cell. By different ways, through different doors, they parted; but when, O, when, to meet again! Poor Kate was crushed and broken-hearted; -even hope seemed now to desert her. She wept like a child in the doctor's arms. She passed into the street; from thence, for he could not leave her now, be took a carriage, and'once more landed at his own door. Here thn found she a home; and now the scholastic but devoted Nancy became more devoted to her thlan ever. With these friends was she willing to remain, for their sympa- thies were with her and her cause. The shades of evening were gathering round, the stars shone brightly, the moon gave forth her splendor; but in William's gloomy cell came no light to cheer or to gladden. ]I   t              KsATE STANTON  .        219 He paced his apartment slowly and pensively - and wept! In the presence of his sister he restrained himself, that she might not know his sadness; but now he poured forth his' grief unnoticed and unknown. In the memory of his sister, he knew they had never quarrelled -no unkindness had; ever caused them tears; but now his overflowing heart threw off every bond, the full springs were opened, and his tears gushed forth plenteously. And O, what have I done, that I am thus immured?  O, mother, are you looking down on me, your afflicted son? Do you see me now, and know what I am enduring, how much I am suffering, -for what I have not done? "O, this bitter, bitter world! That voice said hope. Pray what does hope mean? There is no hope for me; I am indeed wretched! i, If Curtis' cash had nbt come out right; if it had only been wrong when this accusation fell on me, there might be a chance of a more thorough examination into it; but now what good will it do for me?   Who ever reexamines fig- ures when the work is done, and proves all right?      No- body. Then I am here for two years! What sort of a being will I be when those two years have passed away, and I am free again?  I shall not be employed anywhere, and I must beg, steal, or starve! "Starve, I will not; beg, I don't want to; and as for stealing, why, I should then be entitled to board and lodging here, to which now I have no right. O, you law-makers, how many have been the victims of mistaken law; been pent up here in innocence, only to come forth villains and out- throats!"  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6993-00000111"/> 220        K AT E STANTON. Thus reasoned William; and how near to truth, may be ascertained by any one who chooses to read a few pages in any court calendar. They are all alike,- the innocent are immured with the guilty; their misfortunes gain them strange friends and associates, and few, save those whose early principles are too deeply fixed to be rooted, escape con- tamination.   CHAPTER XIX. Why, they'd blow on each other, were they caught; But who's to catch them? SATTER'S HOME. "WHAT 'S the name of the next game you would be playing, Tom?" said Mr. Richard Melcher, one day,- to his particular friend and follower, Mr. Thomas Burton. "I don't know, Dick. I hate to be idle, as much as any man; but it is so safe here, that, while the money lasts, I don't care to venture foot again on Uncle Sam's dominions. There can't be much fun in dancing to the tune of (Peace, troubled soul;' and, as for dancing on nothing, at present, it is not just according to my mind. What do you want to do, --something in the bold line, or the sneaking way?- for you are good in either." "I cannot decide for myself, either; we may as well lie by till something handy turns up." Do as you please, Dick. I have half a mind to study for the church. They say that the laborers are few, and I may stand a chance; and I need a new cloak. My old disguises are getting threadbare, and I must have a new one." "Ha! ha! ha!

When does your reverence begin your discourses?" "Hold your tongue, Dick Melcher! Do you s'pose I'm going to preach? Don't you see, with that poor pair of eyes of yours, that the legal functionaries are in search of me in the States, and religion is the only metal that will pass cur- rent there, and no questions asked, you fool? Have not I sported the lumper and portage business, the walking gentle- man, the man of fashion, the charcoal-dealer, with my face as black as a nigger's, and did n't old Reed smell me out of all that?--and his successor, old Clapp, is another just such an one, that can see through an inch board!" "H a! so he can,- when there's a knot-hole in it! Did n't he grab a gentleman in the Merchants' Exchange, a short time ago, taking him for a noted pickpocket? - me, Tom, me, he was looking after, ha! ha!--and didn't he have to apologize to him? Just because he was walking about in there, reading the papers, and so on, with Superintendent 1Whipple's card in his pocket, and by his invitation,-just, I say, because he wore a moustache, and looked foreign. I guess, if he blundered on all that wear their hair under the nose, now, he would have to apologize or be kicked?" "That he would - ourselves, for instance! Eh, Dick?" ( Scarce, Tom; now ye are stepping on delicate ground, as the lady said." "About those papers, Dick. It is quite time to do some- thing with them; and we may as well summon our council, and see what use to make of them. They are worth heaps of   KATE STANTON.          223 money; but it is in poor shape to handle. I shall have to be brassy, and face old Fussell."      6u1 The devil you will!" said Dick. "The devil I must, Dick." J     4 "How?" ( Religiously, my boy; religiously, young man!" I Ha! I take you now. The Reverend Mr., &amp;c., &amp;c."

"You are making a mighty din, for gentlemen of your stamp; unless you have changed your tactics, Tom, and then it is always time we changed ours." "What if we do hollo and yell, what business is it to you, 8am?" asked Burton. "None, in the least; though, perhaps if you had heard the news, you might be keeping scarce, just now!" "Wat news? what news?" cried Tom and Dick, simul- taneously. "O, I've waked you up, have I! And perhaps it may be eome business of yours to find out what the news is I might tell, if I chose to do so." "Speak out, you fool!" said Tom; " or perhaps it may be some business of mine to make you, Sam." "Well you needn't be so cross and stuffy! I was only going to say that if, any of you want to see an American ship- of-the-line, there's one just at the entrance of the harbor; and perhaps this ship-of-the-line may want to see some of us, for all I know," said Sam.  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6993-00000113"/> 224        KATE STANTON. "I don't believe there's any danger of that, Tom," said Dick; " they can't expect to find any clue to us here; and, besides, I dcubt very much if the Jamaica people care to have anything to do with us, either, as far as that goes." "To the devil with your fears and doubts!" said Burton; "but one thing I will do, and that is, I'll ship in that craft. If the rest of you choose to follow, then do so; if' not, then stay where you are." "So you mean to apply for the chaplain's berth, do you, Tom?" "Look here, Dick Melcher; 'no more of that, an' thou lov- est me!'" said Tom.  I 'm going to t try to get aboard." "What a fellow that Burton is!" said Dick, as his late companion had got out of hearing. "He is as changeable as the wind'; you never know where to find him. He will put his foot in anywhere he likes; and, lucky for him, he don't get his neck in somewhere where he cannot draw it back when he pleases.  I've been in many a scrape with himn; and, like a cat, if he falls, he always comes right side up." "Well," said Sam, " we are well rid of him, at all events. I have suffered much in his company; I only hope I have seen the last of him." "Lucky for you, if you can say so ! For my part, I '1 go you ten better, that you 'll both of you turn up somewhere in the United States, and be fast friends, yet." "Look you, Dick Melcher; that ship is bound on a cruise she will not see the end of for these eighteen months to come. If he ships in her,- as most likely he will,- depend upon it, he has some scheme in that wild pate of his, that we know   1 KATE STANTON.        225 nothing of. He 'll have to toe the mark till he returns; and, then, look out for squalls!" "A. word with you, Sam Swallow. If Tom Burton chooses /f:   to break with us now, why, the blame be upon his own head; and I tell you again, Sam Swallow, what- I would tell no other man living, that, rather than see that Burton again, I would cut my throat from ear to ear, and then sprnpg from the rocks into the sea!" "Whew! whew! you're going it strong, now! What's in the wind, I wonder, that makes you talk so? I believe you're out of your head, Dick." 4 Look you, Sam Swallow; it may n't be the fashion for a villain, such as I have been, to be a-turning round, and being pious, and all that, unless it be for the purpose of disguise, and playing my part over again; but I tell you that the blood of John Green starts up before me every step I take; and, go where I will, do what I will, it is just the same! I see it on my hands, and his frightful form, all bruised and. mangled, is torturing me like a devil! Every time I turn, I see it; and always before me. If I turn, IT turns; if I run, IT runs, or walk, IT walks Sometimes I go and stand with my face to the wall; and it is no matter,- somehow or other, THAT stands in between me and the wall! I close my eyes; but I cannot shut out the sight of it." "Bah! Dick Melcher, your brandy is poor, and you don't see straight, my boy!" "Sam Swallow, laugh and jeer as you will, and as long as you please! I tell you I am not drunk, nor sprung; but I see that awful sight, and it will be the death of me, sure!" "Well, I s'pose it will; but not just now. I s'pose there's  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6993-00000114"/> 226        KATE  STANTON. some hemp-seed sown in the States that will be ripe enough, when Eveleth has orders to string you up. You can't be touched for it, if you stay where you are." "Do you want to drive me mad, Sam?" 4"Why, no, not exactly! I shouldn't make anything by it. There's no show for wild beasts in these parts; and you would n't pay the cost of transportation to any other place. I could n't make anything by that spec, any way." "Have done, have done, Sam Swallow!" ;  Why, man, you're drunk," said Sam. "Will you be quiet, you hound? If you know what's best for yourself, you will." "Bah! you make me sick!" "I'll make you worse, if you don't be quiet." "Nay, now, Dick; you want tuning." "Beware, Sam! You are no hand to tune me, though," said Dick. "There, now, Dick, say no more. Pass the bottle; and, if you've got a psalm to tell, why; out with it. I won't bother you." "O, you won't, will you?  So you have made up your mind to be obliging! All the better for you. But I want you sober just now; so give up the bottle." The bottle was yielded; and then Dick resumed his speech. "I say, Sam Swallow, all I want to see of Tom Burton, I have seen. O, this bloody, stiff, stark, staring form! Out of my sight! I shall surely go crazy. And yet, I didn't strike the blow,- and I didn't throw you down the well-hole alone, John!

Ias he sent you to claim his own, John O0, Sam! hY    I 'm-I 'm-" The wretched man - the victim of self-torture and direful remorse- seemed to have had before his sight more than hu- man eyes could bear to gaze upon, and not quail before the view; and Dick fell quivering and fainting to the floor. A glass of water, thrown in his face by his companion, aroused him to consciousness; and, raising himself on one elbow, he east a hasty glance around the oom. At first, he seemed to see nothing of his tormentor; then, as with returning delirium, he saw once more the object of his terror, and once again he swooned. "This won't do," murmured Sam; " he wants bleeding;" and, suiting the action to the word, he whipped out a knife, and, slitting up the seam of Melcher's coat-sleeve, made a deep incision, that soon had the desired effect. The poor man rose slowly, and trembling as if with great weakness; then sunk into a chair. "What's the matter? How came my arm so wet, Sam? It's blood, Sam; whose is it?" "It a'n't -John Green's, Dick; so be easy and quiet. You've been sick, and I've doctored you; so rest a while," said Sam. "Well, I believe I was sick; but I have had an awful dream - and yet, how real it seemed!" "It was real enough, by your actions, Dick; you fright- ened me." "I remember all, now; but my vision, my dog, my tor- mentor, has seemed willing to give me a short respite; and now, Tom, I will say what I was going to at first. I say this will be  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6993-00000115"/> 228       KATE STANTON. the death of me. I shall go off in one of these fits, yet. Sam Swallow, it's awful to commit a murder, and I a'n't used to it yet!" "No, Dick, you ha'n't much pluck, to be sure; but you mnust keep your hand in, now; you've done a swinging mat- tor, and you know it." Sam, I did not mean to kill that man. You came late lhome that night, and did n't see the whole of it. Burton :ccused Green of cheating, in the cards, and knocked him senseless, where he lay, till Tom thought he was coming to, and then we together dropped him into the old, dry well, where - but you know the rest. I did n't mean to kill him, and he must have struck against the stony sides when he was falling down there." "Then why do you let your conscience trouble you about it, Dick?" ,( I don't know; it does, though." "Don't let it." "I can't help it." "You can, Dick " "How?" "Just kill a few more, Dick, and conscience will stop its troubling." "Villain! you are worse than I, bad as I am." "I am not! AWho dares say I ever killed a man?" 'Perhaps not; but you needn't look so wild. I don't accuse you of it. I tell you, Sam, that Tom Burton will have to answer, yet, for that murder; and if I dared " Hfold, there, Dick Helcher!

"What's it to you, on whom I blow? tell me that, now. What's the scrape now, that sets you on fire, Sam Swallow?" "Scrape enough; a'n't I a party to the facts?"  Yes, I s'pose you are; and I 'd take my oath you would be the first to turn state's evidence on your fellows, and hang us, to clear yourself, like a knave." ( Dick, you know I would n't." "I know no such thing; you would do it as soon as you would drink a glass of brandy." "I tell you I would n't; but, for all that, I won't have any of the gang blowed upon while I can prevent it; my blood is up, and Sam Swallow a'n't the man to flinch, after he has said the word to go it strong." "Look here, you devil's brag, or whatever else you may call yourself! I'm not afraid of you, and all you can bring to back you up; but I do say, you are more afraid of Tom Burton than I am; and, when he's by, you don't dare to call your soul your own; and you know it." "An I, though? Prove it! I dare you!" "A'n't you always sneaking and snivelling, I should like to know? I say, Sam, how was it on the night of the murder, when Tom was on the point of sending you to keep poor Green company? -Wan'i your teeth chattering like an ape; and did n't you shiver and shake in your trousers, as though you had a fit of fever and ague?" "I back out, Dick; say no more 'an' thou lovest me;' go 20  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6993-00000116"/> 230        KATE STANTON. on with your yarn, only don't talk of blowing on your best friends, for if I anm afraid of one of them, I a'n't the man to stand by and see them or him blowed and poached on, when I can prevent it; and if I can't prevent it, why, then  "Yes, why, then you can't, you meant to say. Now, hear me through, Sam Swallow.  I am afraid of Tom Burton when lhe's around, and 1 a'n't ashamed to own up to the fact, and I'll tell you why; and that's more. I was a small boy once, and may be you were, unless the devil made you at first of the bigness you now are, just to suit his own purposes the Detter; but I was a boy once, and I may have been a good boy when I was born, and perhaps until I was past four years old; but there 's no knowing that, either; any way, I never knew my mother, -believe I was found by some one, but I never had any knowledge of anybody's laying claim to me, till I found myself in Burton's hands, and he brought me up - and how, think you? Why, I took a life's lesson in crime, of him, from the very first recollection I have of this unhappy world. He first taught me to lie to the charitable street-passengers, to whimper a tale of want and woe, to start their tears; and then they'd give me something, which I would clutch, and run round the corner of the street, where he would be waiting to take my beggings. Then he made me go to the confectionery stores, and ask for water, and, when the woman turned away to fetch it, I was made to steal the cakes that the counters were full of; and I did this time and again. As I grew yet older and bigger, he made me pick pockets; and then, when I did not make out very well, he used to beat me, and send me off to try again; then I would run away, but he always found me, and, after trying this a   2I RHKATE STANTON.                 231 few times, I gave up in despair. I did not dare to dispute him or cross him; for, if I did n't mind his orders, I used, to get blows that often laid me stiff for the nonce. Finally, I was his young mate, as he called me when he was good- natured; then he taught me to drink. Once he drugged my brandy,- for, when it was pure, it took a big dose to upset me; and when he got me just in trim,' as he termed it, he made me rob a house with him. I could not prove, on the trial, that Burton forced me to steal with him, so we had to hammer stone for the state, and, like Othello, we did the state some service. When I left the prison, I was fit for any game, that presented itself; and, knowing no other trade, I was soon again engaged with Tom, and, ever since then, we have lived and labored together. I never knew any other life; but, now I tell you, Sam Swallow, I mean to be free. I 've robbed for Tom, I 've forged for Tom, I 've lied for Tom, I 've killed for Tom; but I hate him, for the life he has taught me, and I tell you, Sam Swallow, once for all, I won't hang for Tom. He has always twirled me around his finger like a plaything. I have dared to do nothing else. I feared him, but now he's gone; and, like the bird the snake tries to charm, but loses its power and influence when the eye-glare ceases to meet, he shall charm me no longer; and, once for all, I 'm free!" Fool, Dick Melcher! He's your friend, and you can't live without him; you know you can't. Tom knows his power, and, like the snake you tell of, he but dances off a little while -only again to bring you nearer to his coil." "He shall not do it, Sam; by --, he shan't! My blood is up, I say, and I 'll duck to no man I 've seen yet. That 3   &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6993-00000117"/> 232        KATE  STANTON. murder has done my work. I s'pose the devil will have me, now, body and soul. I can't help it, but I did n't mean to kill him, Sam, I did n't." "Who said you did, Dick?  "Whyi, no one, but ---- "3ah! Drink, I say! drink a drop; it may do you good, Dick.  You've got the tremens a coming on, old chap, and nothing but it, Dick." "To     with your brandy! I tell you, I give up brandy, and you with it, forever! O, that form again!- he's coming, I see him -that battered head, that bloody face -those eyes, those eyes- O, John, I didn't mean- I did n't mean - don't come nearer me - O, Sam, save me from this devil's man! - I - I' m I ' " O, remorse! O, guilty conscience! There is no rest. Even it would seem the murdered man cannot rest in his place, but must, like Hamlet's father, have his foul, unnatural murder avenged and made known to the world. Again fell Melcher to the floor, faint and exhausted; that form seemed to flit before his gaze, and vainly he tried to shut out the sight by holding his hands before his face; lut, ah! that sight was within him; and, like the worm that dieth not, seemed feasting on his vitals. As well might he, standing on the bank of Niagara's mighty stream, attempt - to close his cars against the roar and rush of its awful waters. That sight was within him; he could not shut it out, and he knew it. Long lay Meloher, in a fainting-fit, and only awoke to find a fever settling upon his fiame; and his companion placed him on a bed.   CIAPTER XX. Truth, crushed to earth, will rise again! The immortal years of God, are hers; But Error, wounded, writhes in pain, And dies amidst her worshippers. Six months had our William Stanton been in jail. His kind friends at the store, particularly Mr. Fussell, had now almost arrived at the conviction that Stanton was really guilty of the offence for which he was suffering. "And yet," said Mr. Maxwell, "I cannot help feeling that we have acted hastily. I would I could recall his sentence and confinement." "And I, too," said his partner. ( Numberless are the times, Mr. Fussell, that of an after- noon I have walked down to the jail, and stood at the grating; and I have always found William full of trust, and his bright eyes beaming with a clearness that seemed almost to reflect innocence itself. O, that I could be the bearer of more joyous news! And his sister, too, so full of love and hope for her brother! she has not yet doubted his truth." "You may well say that, friend Maxwell; and did I not know he would-not accept a pardon, I would move for one to 20*  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6993-00000118"/> 234         ATE ST ANTO N. be granted at once. Do you think he will allow himself to be set free before the expiration of his sentence, -I mean, of course, unless he is fully acquitted of all suspicion on the premises?" "I know he will?not, M1r. Fussell. I suggested to him that I had lopes to obtain a pardon for him, and I shall never, to my dying day, forget the glance, the look, he gave me. 'Pardon! said he; (I ask pardon of no one, and neither will I accept pardon for an offence I have not com- miitted ; it would be acknowledging the crime as my own.' And he further told Inc that he was buoyed up with his con. sciousness of' innocence, and his only trouble was his sister's anxiety for him," continued Mr. Maxwell. "They are, indeed, much bound up in each other." "I never saw such an instance of kindred affection in my life; quite unusual, I fear, between brothers and sisters." "Have you visited her at the doctor's?" asked Mr. Fussell. "But rarely; though I learned that you have been a fre- quent visitor," returned 3Mr. Maxwell. "I have, I assure you; and such an instance of Christian fortitude has done me good; and I have wept more on seeing her, during the past six months, than, excepting when be- reaved of my wife, I have done since our little boy wandered away so strangely, years and years gone by," said Mr. Fussell. (Strange that nothing was ever heard of him. I know it was very long, before you gave up all hope of seeing him in life." "Y es; every effort proved unavailing; and, although we   KATE STANTON.          235 searched the city through, you may rest assured, a parent's hope remained long behind." Remembrances of early days thronged thick and fast over the old man's mind. He thought of his marriage with her who had lately departed for a new life in another world; he thought of his first-born son, and his short career among them. He remembered him as a bright and laughing child, who used to climb his knee, and play bo-peep with his hand- kerchief; and then he thought of the day the child wandered away from the house,- the family lived then in the same house they still occupied; -the day was a fine one; warm and genial was the air; the hall door was open; his child was seen standing in the entry-way, his curly hair dancing in the breeze, and, as the little ringlets waved above him, the boy would chuckle and shout; then presently he disappeared. As the old man's memory reverted back to that old time, his tears flowed thick and fast, and he did not try to restrain them: they relieved his surcharged heart, and he let them gush forth. Mr. Maxwell did not try to soothe him, for he felt there was comfort even in those tears. Presently a knock was heard at the door of the inner counting-room, where this scene was passing. Mr. Maxwell slowly opened it, and Mr. Curtis, the cashi clerk, entered and closed the door behind him.  "May I be pardoned for this intrusion, gentlemen?" said he. "We are not engaged, Mr. Curtis," said Mr. Maxwell, and Mr. Fussell quickly wiped away his tears. "I am sorry for myself, as the cause of much trouble and  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6993-00000119"/> 236        KATE STANTON. vexation, gentlemen, but quite glad for others. William Stanton is innocent!"  "Innocent! say you?" cried Mr. Maxwell. "Innocent!" exclaimed Mr. Fussell; "are you as sure this time as when your accusation called him guilty? Have a care, Mr. Curtis, O, have a care!" "I would, sir, that I had more care before; then I had not been the unlucky cause of all the poor boy's suffering. Shall I tell you all nlow, gentlemen?" "Yes, and quickly too!" exclaimed Mr. Fussell. "Every moment here is a moment added to that boy's incarceration!" "Gentlemen," said Mr. Curtis, "here is a check for one thousand dollars, which I found just now, as I was examining into an old account of Mr. Blanchard's, and of which I had to make a duplicate. It seems that, in filing away those papers, this was also put into the wrapper, which must have laid on the desk when I was making up the bank deposit, and this was put into the bundle of duplicate accounts instead of the bank-book, I suppose. I must have checked it as entered on the 'deposit-ticket, and then put it in the wrong place, as my. cash did not vary." "A case of absence of mind, young man, that has caused more pain and suffering to an innocent person than can be easily or quickly forgotten; but come, Mr. Maxwell, we must not lose time. Stanton musfr be set at liberty before the sun  sets, and we must act together in this matter." "May I accompany you?" asked lMr. Curtis. "May you?  You MUST! You will be wanted to clear this up with the judge, to whomnwe must first go." The trio left the store, and, after the necessary prelimi-   K A I S T A NO.         237 nary arrangements were made with the proper officers, they hurried to young Stanton's cell. Few were the words spoken there. With hurried and ner- vous exclamations, old Fussell showed authority for releasing the prisoner, and in a little less than seventy minutes from the discovery of the error he breathed the free air of heaven! Kate was seated in the doctor's office, with her back to the door, busily occupied in making out his bills and accounts, which had been done by her brother just six months before. It is needless to say what occupied her mind, or whether the papers that lay before her held her entire attention or not. The doctor himself was absent, and his sister Nancy was in some other part of the house, engaged in domestic affairs. Kate did not hear a very modest ring at the street door, nor a little bustle that was made in the entry; neither did she hear the handle of the office door turn round, nor did she hear a soft step along the carpet; but soon a dark shadow was cast upon the paper before her, as of some one pass- ing between her table and the window behind her, and she turned her head to meet the intruder. It needed not a word.  William was before her, and clasped her in his arms; and, when the first burst of feeling was over, and the first emotion subsided, his companions en- tered the room. To Mr. Fussell and his kind partner she gave a cordial greeting and a willing reception; but when she saw the face of the clerk, she shuddered - her cheek flushed, then paled. Varied emotions of dislike and hatred seemed mingled there; for her heart told her that before her now stood the  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6993-00000120"/> 238       KA E  STANTON. author of all her wrong and unhappiness, and she knew not what to do. "Miss Stanton," said Mr. Curtis, advancing. "Come no nearer me, sir, if you please. I cannot bear it." "But, Miss Stanton," resumed the clerk. "I can hear nothing from you, sir," interrupted Kate; " there stands he whom you most have wronged, and to him belong all apologies, if you have any, for your baseness. A man that can stand in open court, and debase and injure the fair name and reputation of a brother of mine, must hold no con- verse with me. You may tell me you did not mean to do it. or some other childish excuse; there stands one more injured than I am, and to him must you sue for pardon, if to any one." ' Then to you, William Stanton, I appeal, in and with the recollection of all the kindly intercourse we once enjoyed, before the late circumstances occurred which have brought so much ill and unhappiness. To you I appeal sincerely for pardon and forgiveness. I did not intend you wrong, you must be already aware; yet, under all circumstances, how could I judge otherwise than I did? The statement I made to our employers you have already heard, and will you con. demn me, for a course which, though unpleasant in the ex- treme, was the only one that could then be adopted? I as- sure you that I have been a great sufferer during your con- finement, and I now feel as if it would do me good to hide my head in very shame at the discovery of my error." "I think, my young friends," said Mr. Fussell, " that Mr. Curtis is sincere in his present feelings, and the result of this day's experience will teach him a lesson he will not soon for-   KATE STANTON.           239. get, - that of extreme care how he enters evidence on a pub- lic trial, where circumstantial evidence only can be found, and on which only must depend conviction or acquittal." "And I would add my voice," said his partner, " that you, William, and your dear sister, may find it in; your hearts to pardon this sad indiscretion. We are all mortal, and liable to error." "At your bidding, then, be it so," said Kate, extending her hand to Mr. Curtis, and then transferring it to William, who also took it kindly; "it seems our fortune to bear affliction, and fain would I might hope it could end with this." "You had better return to the store, Mr. Curtis; and be assured all further notice of this transaction is at an end," said Mr. Fussell. UGlad to be relieved so easily, Mr. Curtis, with another apology, left the room. "I am very sorry," said Mr. Maxwell, " that Doctor Beach is absent. He should be here to share our pleasure and hap- piness at this reunion." "He is coming," said Kate; "that is his chaise just stop- ping at the door." Where's his sister, Nancy?" asked William. "I 'll send for her," said Kate, touching the bell. "What have we here?" cried Doctor Beach, entering. "What! my William? I called at the - ahem- this after- noon, and heard you had left very suddenly. So it's all right, eh? Gentlemen, your pardon; but my young pro- teg deserved my first salutation. Pray be seated." "No apologies, doctor, we beg," said Mr. Fussell; "we  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6993-00000121"/> 2410       KATE STANTON. only awaited your arrival to take our leave; but, in leaving our young friend with you now, we trust it is only to wel- come him again at our store when he shall have become fully recruited in health and strength, under such care and atten- tion as you may dictate; suggesting only, and you join me, brother Maxwell, that a short journey may do him and his sister no harm ; and our store, doctor, shall become responsi- ble to you for all expenses and outlays." "That's the very thing, neighbor Fussell; the boy wants building up, if anybody does, and I don't mind taking a va- cation myself; it's years since I had one; and I may as well take Nancy along, and shut up the house." The door of the office opened at this juncture, and Nancy entered, curtsying to those assembled, and took a seat without further ceremony. "Sister Nancy!" cried the doctor, " is that the way you do things? Don't you see who's here, Nancy?" "Well, who, for wonder?" "Wipe your spectacles, sister, and look around a bit." William was not proof enough to stand still while'the in- vestigation was going forward, but sprang at once into her arms. "Well, now, I declare, it is you! I have n't dreamed three nights running of cranberry-pies, not to know some- thing was to come of it! So you a'n't a ---- then, after all? Well, do tell, now; this is a comfort, I do declare!

As the door closed behind them the doctor began: "That boy is in a very bad way. Confinement- hasn't done his frame any good; and his sister is a mere shadow to look at. A minrd at unrest, gentlemen, is the hardest thing to cure." "It must be so, doctor," said Mr. Maxwell; i but, since the cause is removed, I trust the effect of the change will be shown, particularly when the mountain air is felt, and the genial breezes of the countr fan their faces." "Doctor!"exclaimed Mr. Fussell, t we yield all claim to the b oy's s ervies , till you pronounce him well and vigorous. He does look wan enough." "n'e shall have every attention, gentlemen, that science can dictate as the proper course to be adopted and pursueu ; but the most suitable plan, at present, is change of scene. He has a heart I have seldom  seen equalled; and it hall not be my fault, if he does not revive at once,-and the heart has more to do with the rest of the body than the mere bundle of flesh signifies." "I believe you, doctor; and pray teach him, while he is with you, that we are his friends, for there does seem to be a lingering feeling of supposed wrong, done by us, still in his breast, which kind words and deeds can only eradicate and destroy. O, that Curtis could ever have suspected such a  boy of crime!

Maxwell, tell the doctor what we have agreed upon." "I will gladly do so. It is this; that, in consideration of the deep sense of injustice done to Stanton, and in view of the high moral worth, which we feel he is possessed of, we have determined to promote him, young as he is; and we think him competent, also, to a clerkship in our store. This situation is about to be vacated' and, his previous duties having had no reference to the books, we feel he will be pleased with the change, particularly as the salary increases in pro- portion to the responsibility taken; a course we have always adopted, and, for the most part, with the best results." (4 Are you going to keep that lubberly fellow that brought all this trouble to pass, friend Maxwell, and give him a chance to try the trick again?" asked the doctor. "It's rather too Christian, according to my way of thinking." "' To err is human; to forgive, divine, -eh, doctor?-and with all your feelings for young Stanton, and they do not ex- ceed my own, we must be merciful, even to those who show no mercy!"

Can these things be real? St. VINCENT'S DREAM. THE events narrated in the last chapter were scarcely ten days old, ere our young friends, accompanied by Dr. Beach and his sister, started on their proposed journey. It is unnecessary to follow them on their course from the metropolis of New   England, as they pursue their pleasure-     I track  towards the White Mountains, from  thence to New      I York, visiting all the remarkable places usually visited  in    : that state.     . It is needless to speak of their varied emotions on behold- ing the  indescribable grandeur of Niagara, the majestic beauty of the mighty lakes; but, to continue our tale during    :- their absence, it may be necessary to state that Martin Fussell and Clara Everson  were duly married, and were located        I at once in the family mansion  of their father, and were cordially welcomed thither by their sisters, Ellen and Mari- anne; thus partially making good the vacancy occasioned by      I the decease of their mother. 1f  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6993-00000123"/> 244        KATE STANTON. Residing also with them, at present, was the Rev. Mr. Parsons, who had brought letters of the strongest recom- mendation from a business firm in Calcutta, and who claimed to be a lineal descendant of Mr. Robert Parsons, of whom mention has already been made, at the commencement of this volume, as uncle to Mrs. Stanton. The Rev. Mr. Parsons was tall, well-formed, and quite dignified in his appearance, and his whole bearing seemed that of a gentleman; at least he possessed all the needful attrac- tions which polite society requires. "I don't understand it, sir; I assure you, I don't," said Mr. Fussell, one day. "I don't see how you could be a son of my old friend. Why, sir, we were boys together; we grew to be men together; our sports we shared, and our pas- times were the same. Yet you tell me you are his son, and I never knew it - never knew he had a son so old as you are; no, sir, I can't see it." "I am sorry, sir, that you are obliged to doubt my iden- tity; but, verily, I marvel that you do, since he was abroad so long a time, and out of the country." 4( But, sir, to speak plainly, my old friend Bob Parsons, was a bachelor, a regular old bachelor; and, if he were living now, would be about my own age. No, sir, it must be a different individual you sprung from - some other Mr. Parsons." "My dear sir, allow me the pleasure of undeceiving you. Your old friend, you must of a truth remember, went to Cal- cutta during his business career." "He did, he did. Well, sir, what then?" "You must certainly also remember, he was absent, as I am informed, three years at least."   KATE STANTON.           245 "Yes, I do remember that. What then, what then?" "Why, sir, then he must have married there!" "It does not necessarily follow, sir," said Mr. Fussell. 'No, sir, it does not necessarily follow that he married there, because he was there three or even four years- not a neces- sary consequence at all, sir." ( Remember, sir, what the gospel teacheth, when it saith, Be not faithless, but believing.' He was married there, and I am his only son; ay, his only child." "O, I cannot, cannot think it! Why, sir, my friend Bob Parsons would have gone almost crazy, sir, at the very thought of marriage. He never liked the sex sufficiently to entertain the most remote idea of ever asking one of its number to share his bed and board." "( Verily, sir, I know it is hard removing an old man's con- firmed opinion, when it is confirmed, and that it is very difficult to undeceive one who has ever enjoyed, as he thought, the confidence of a well-tried fiiend; but, sir, I do not come altogether unprepared for the service which I have undertaken. I have proofs, sir, proofs that you yourself must see the force of, when I place them before you in proper time and place." "Well, Mr. Parsons, I am ready to see them now, here in this room, as we sit together. Sir, I beg to assure you that this very room has often echoed to the treadand voice of my old and dear friend; and in this room, and seated in this very arm- chair which now contains myself, has he shared with me, and I with him, our mutual confidences. Your -proofs must be solid as gold, to change that full trust. I feel that he never kept anything back in the story of his life.

"I need'not go far, sir, to do that. I will then, sir, begin by showing you his marriage certificate, which of itself is a fair proof of my assertion." "Indeed! I   " "You see, sir, there is no connivance there; well drawn, and somewhat in the New England style, I think, sir." "True-I see; but-" "You are thinking this is the original. It is not, sir, but is a copy of the record of the clergyman who performed the service, and to whose papers I have had free access." "A copy only, then, sir. Then the proof is imperfect to commence with. I want no copies; I ought to have the real documents, to prove your assertions to my satisfaction." "I cannot satisfy you then on this point?" "Not yet, reverend sir; though I confess to being somewhat shaken in my former belief. What further papers have you that bear upon ' tlis point,' as you term it?" "I have also a copy of the entry made by the town or parish register, of the death of my mother, and recorded as the late wife of Robert Parsons." "A copy again; but of course I could not expect to see an original town record." "Then here, sir, is another paper, which I feel confident you will recognize as the very handwriting of your old friend, my father, or I very much mistake." "Reverend sir, how can I further doubt your claims upon me! This paper, then, is a will, drawn up and fully attest- ed, as the law requires; and this, I should say, certainly   KATE STANTON.          247 is Robert's writing-his will- and naming me and my partner his joint executors; and 'revoking, and annulling all other last wills he may have made; and bestowing all moneys and property, real and personal, after arranging certain legacies, upon his son, Thomas Parsons, of Calcutta, now residing there as missionary, &amp;c., &amp;c.' Well, Mr. Parsons, this-shall be duly looked into, and we will confer again upon the subject, in as short a time as may be possible. In the mean time, reverend sir, believe me, I will exert myself, to my utmost ability, to substantiate your claims with my partner. One word, however.  How is it that you have allowed so long a time to elapse, since your father's decease, before you endeavored to establish a claim to his estate, and enter upon your succession?" "Simply, sir, because this will did not until quite recently come into my possession, owing to being placed with other papers, which were marked as miscellaneous, and, from their appearance, seemed to be of but very little value; and since the receipt of it, I had a number of pressing duties upon the station, which demanded my personal attention, and must needs be completed, before my conscience would listen to my earnest appeal to be released from my labors, in order to pursue a voyage to the United States." "Do you remain long in the city, sir?" "At present, I shall not, as I have business to trans- act some miles away.  When this is finished, I shall be pleased to return, and learn your decision upon the subject matter before us."

A strange story this," said Mr Fussell, as he rapidly paced the room, after the departure of his visitor. "Yes, a very strange story; but I am slow to account this all true. This missionary has, I should say, been imposed upon in some way or other. He seems honest enough himself, and evidently thinks his claim is good, and secure enough to him, at all events. I can hardly believe that my old playmate did really marry. He was a wild boy; perhaps he, - no, he would Il't do that though,--and yet he did go to Calcutta --he did stay there nearly four years -he might have married in that time. O, I'm  a fool to think the world sincere, if Bob married out there, and then came home, leaving his family, if he had one, and never telling me one word about it! He never looked very taciturn either. O, how can I believe it? Yet, that will looks genuine, and is his writing surely. I aml afraid there is no mistake after all. This son of his seems of proper mould; but his features don't much resemble Bob's- a warm climate, perhaps, and the brownings of many suns. Well, I won't hurry about it; at any rate, there's time enough. If this young man has seen fit to wait all this while, it won't hurt him to tarry a little longer. It rather upsets my plans, however, and must be looked into somewhat more care- fully. Brother Maxwell, of course, must be called into council.

Mr. Carter was not naturally a vicious or even a thought- less young man, but yet his views of morality were not on a footing with what should be deemed upright and open-faced. One day he said to William, "Don't you want to make some money?" "To be sure I do, provided it can be done with safety and propriety." "H Propriety! do you think I would counsel you in anything that was not the very essence of propriety and straightfor- wardness?"  Why, no, I suppose not; but money is not to be made always at just the time you want it, Carter, and not always to be had for the seeking either." That 's true; but every year I do a little of this; and, though I am not over-successful, yet I keep trying each year, in the hope of coming or hitting right at last; and as the wheel of fortune is said to be ever turning, and always moving, it may come around to my turn at last; but I have not yet told you my scheme - my modus operandi.' "Well, what is it?  1 am all attention." u Did you ever hear of a lottery, Stanton?" "Of course I have; but you don't mean that such is your plan for making money -to engage in such trash, Carter?"   KATE STANTON.          253 "Trash or no trash, there is much money made in the business." "Yes, and much lost, too, Carter." "But the chance is more to be the winner, as you only risk what you invest, and nothing more; and, as you stake, you make up your mind that you are willing to risk so much for the sake of greater gain." "I have no funds to throw away, Carter, and yet I have a mind to try my luck; but what do you know about it? There is no office in the city where one can buy tickets." "'Yes, there is; but it is somewhat 'underground,' and known only to the initiated, lest the police should find it out, and blow on the agent. The man I mean is a selling agent for a Baltimore house; he keeps the tickets with him, and has daily communication by telegraph with his principal. I each year buy a few quarter, half, or eighth tickets, and am going nowto try again. There is a fine scheme just adver- tised, and the drawing is about to take place; don't you want to join me in my project?" "I have half a mind to do so. Where is the office?" "I cannot tell you, for I am bound to secrecy; but this I will say, that it is not far from State and Devonshire streets. What say you, Stanton?" "I say I think I will follow you, and see where you go." "You could not do so, even if you were mean enough, which I know you are not; for I shoul4 not go directly to the place, lest I might be watched and -discovered. Will you join with me or not?" "I will see, and let you know in time." 22  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6993-00000128"/> 254        KATE STANTON. "Well, that time is just now, or never; for I am going out now, and am about to invest for myself a bit, and will take along your order, if you will only say the word." "How much do you want, Carter?" "Give me ten dollars, and I will do the business, and go you halves, taking myself all the risk of holding the tickets." "How much are yoa going to invest for yourself?" "I shall put in a ten myself." "Well, tlihecn, here is mine, though my conscience says no; but my pocket wants replenishing, and salary day is some- what distant. I will try the ten to begin with." With these words William handed Carter the ten dollars demanded, and he at once repaired to the agent's office, say- ing he should soon return and roport progress. When Carter returned, which 4ie did in about an hour, he displayed to William's eyes a number of elegantly-embel- lished papers, of checks regularly numbered, and adorned with the broad stamp of the State of Maryland. (t So far so good, Stanton. Our twenty dollars bought a package of quarter tickets!" L( When is the drawing to be, Carter?" (I shall hear to-nmorrow afternoon the full result." "( What! so soon '? At least we have not to wait long in suspense. What's the scheme?"                 I "The highest prize is thirty thousand dollars, and so on down to five-dollar1 prizes."

William's   KATE STANTON.          255 hopes were on the real high-pressure system, up to the full in castle-building and fancy plans for the future. Like a good brother, he at first thought what he should do for his dear sister Kate, if he drew a lucky prize. ("She shall be out of necessity and anxiety, at any rate, if I am successful," thought he; ("and who knows but I may get the highest prize, or, if not, say the next to the highest, in the scheme?" Had every schemer his whim granted, the very skies would be reached with lofty edifices of every kind and description; gold would be but dross and valueless- unsought for, not wanted in life! Had every dreamer his realization, what would the world be? The much-wished-for to-morrow finally came, and also the afternoon. The other clerks were just returning from dinner, and William was anxiously awaiting Carter's entrance, also, as he said he should return by way of the agent's office, and see what the luck was; and, when he did come, he brought little of hope or satisfaction. "( What luck, Carter?" whispered William, as he entered the counting-room. "Poor at the best, Stanton. Our package brought half its cost, and your half is five dollars, less the usual commission; but I have had so much dealing with the agent, he said he would not charge me anything, and I have invested the bal- ance, to try our' luck once more. Only think, the man who bought just before I did, drew a prize of fifteen hundred dollars!

"Not quite, Stanton, not quite; the other five is invested, you know." "Invested, yes - to draw its two and a half, and so on down to nothing,- a nmere list of blanks. You need not report what the five draws, as I ant not sanguine enough to believe there will be anything fall to my lot. I never was very lucky in scheming'." ( Still, for all that, I will render you a true account of what your five dollars may bring, which will be decided to- morrow." "Always one day forward, is it, then? Heigh-ho! I wish I had never tried my luck. I am a poor hand when I for- sake the old and beaten track to wealth and happiness." "A setting hen never grows fat, Stanton." "Ay, but a rolling stone gathers no moss." "I hope you are no such stone; moss signifies dulness, not bright and blooming flowers of industry," said Carter, smiling. "Be that as it may; I don't care to toss proverbs with you, or handy words of no avail, or of no importance. I must make some mloney; for I am somewhat in debt, and am quite harassed for the means of payment." "What say you, then, to trying your luck in the Broker's Board? There 's a fair chance for you; though the risk is proportionate to the gain to be received." "And to the loss to be sustained, I suppose," said William. "I have had loss enough for one while, though it be but ten dollars."   KATE STANTON.          257 "Don't grumble about that, Stanton; wait till to-morrow; you have five at stake still." "O, this to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, that never comes, but is always in the distance!" i"But, you know, "t is distance lends enchantment to the view,'," said Carter. "Very true, it does; but did you ever know of its being paid back? This view is a poor debtor, though he may never become a bankrupt." "You are not so blue, then, but that you can joke and pun, yet," said Carter. To-morrow came at length; and, on Carter's return from his friend, the lottery-agent, he had the satisfaction of inform- ing William that he was successful, and at once placed in his hands a prize of two hundred and fifty dollars! -and, while William was too much elated at once to express in words his feelings and emotions, Carter said to him: "Now, Stanton, take your money, and buy some fancy stock, and grow rich, and live easy." "Easy, Carter? More easily said than done, I fear, my friiend." "Not at all, not at all, Stanton." "How am I to manage, Carter?' "Simply thus: go to a broker, buy some stock on credit of thirty or sixty days, and make your deposit with him, as is customary. This money will just do it for you." "How shall I go to work? I must not appear green to the broker I am to deal with, by any means; and I know nothing of his trade." 22*  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6993-00000130"/> 258        1 ATE STANTON. "The whole system is quite simple, plain and easy. For instance, you want to buy twenty-five shares of stock in rail- road, of some kind or other. You go to your broker, and say, 'I want you to buy for me so much stock, at buyer thirty days; ' and all it goes up from the price you give, of course, is yours, less the broker's commission for buying and selling, which is a quarter of a dollar each share, both ways,-that is, fifty cents a share for the whole transaction on all the stocks whose par value is one hundred dollars a share; and any stock, of which the value at par is fifty dollars a share, you only pay an eighth per cent. upon, instead of a quarter." "I see, I see," said William; "but, allowing all this to be true, - and it looks very pretty, and quite feasible,-- suppose, instead of rising, the stock should fall on my hands, what then?" "Then," said Carter, "you would lose, of course; but you must watch the market, and only sell during the rise, and not on the falling side." "And if I lose all?" "Then you are what is called a lame duck, that's all; and, when you are buying on time, you are termed a bull, and, when selling on time, you are called a bear." "By the way, I have a fiiend among the brokers, who is not exactly a familiar acquaintance, but one I know well; and I think I will give him a try, Carter." "Do so, Stanton; and success to you, my friend. Say, do I share in any good luck you may have?" , Willingly, Carter, if you will also bear your proportion of any loss I may sustain." "I don't care about that, Stanton; but, as you have your   KATE STANTON.          259 two hundred and fifty dollars for an outlay of only fifteen, it will be no great risk, even should you lose the greater part of it; so I need hardly share that with you." When William went home that night, he pondered much on Carter's conversation; and, had he confided it to his darling sister Kate, would have saved himself much trial and suffer- ing, that speedily followed upon the undertaking he was planning. He was fully possessed with the idea that it must be very easy to make money in the way prescribed; but, alas, poor fellow! too well the result proved the shallowness and short- sightedness of all his hopes and expectations. Though our sex is looked upon as less energetic than the "sterner sex," yet, with woman is found more self-possession, more real thoughtfulness, and a certain slowness, when any great undertaking is advanced, or any new scheme proposed; a certain slowness in the matter as to taking too sudden a hold of such as may prove frail and uncertain. Woman seldom perils her all on the turn of a die; neither is she prone to risk all in one game of cards. She is surely more cautious than man, though seldom can man be found to own and acknowledge it. William felt proud of the acquisition of his lottery prize, yet he felt ashamed, at the same time, of the whole transac- tion; and, though he did not wish the money was where it came from, yet he hardly dared to let his sister know how he acquired it. "I am likely to make money," thought our young friend, "and I don't see why it is not rather sure than otherwise; for, really, speculation is high this season, and things seem  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6993-00000131"/> 260       K A TE S T A N T ON. to be advancing. Yes, I will try to-morrow, and see what I can find." The elated fellow pondered and pondered; and so full was he with his thoughts that he slept but little during the night, and even arose with the dawn of day, so eager was he in erecting air-castles and similar shadowy habitations. As he walked down town, and neared his place of business and toil, he became much pleased with what he called his (brilgt prospects;" and even fancied himself hugging his precious gains, so rapidly, in his mind's eye, was he coining treasures untold. AWilliam wans not selCsh, not mean ; but, in all his thoughts and anticipations, his sister stood in the foreground. In every scene he conjured up and brought to his imagination, her comfort was his theme; her happiness his highest hope. Stepping into a broker's office, he found Mr. C. just perus- ing his morning paper. "Good-morning, Mr. C.," said William, as he entered. "Ia! good-morning, my young friend; but how is it I see you here? What do you need in a broker's office? Do you want to borrow, or lend, or exchange, this morning?" "I want to buy, sir," said he, proudly, and rising to his full height. I Wh at shall I sell you?" "What kind of stock do you think well of, now, for an investment ' " "All stocks on the list are looking up-- yes, all looking up -grand time to buy, sir-yes, grand timhe- no better money's easy- everything low - everything certain to rise S  ---- ---J------o*   KATE  STANTON.         261 soon, at least in sixty days - no mistake about it, I tell you, sir, upon my honor." (' What do you recommend as the best?" Why, Stanton, they are all best; and I don't just know where I should choose myself-- one can't very well buy amiss now." "I don't want to buy a miss nzow, sir,- I am not mar- riageable, at present; but I do want to buy some good stock, that stands the best chance of improving in the shortest time, and the least risky." "Ha! ha! ha! You are as much of a joker as ever, Stanton! - but, never mind what I say; if you want stock for safe investment, I can recommend a number of kinds. Let me see-- there 's Vermont Central Railroad, good stock; rich state, you know, Vermont is--good stock that, and worth about eighty-three at the Board - I can buy it for that to-day. Then there is Norwich and Worcester, that is worth fifty-six, and is doing well; and then there is what, indeed, I ought to have named at first, as the best of all, and that is the Reading mortgage bonds. Those are the things for your money, Stanton." "At about what price for five bonds?" L Let me see, let me see-you want five, do you? Ah! yes, well - yes, I will be generous with you, as this is your first call on such business. I have five of my own, that I bought yesterday; they are selling at fifty-one at the Board, but I will sell them to you at fifty net, at buyer sixty days,- and there 's a bargain for you, my young friend." "I- H "They are sure, are those bonds; none of your fancy sort,  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6993-00000132"/> 2b I       KATE  STANTON. that are good for nothing, but the real artielb, the best stock iu the market. Take them, Stanton. I will bet you will make fifty dollars a bond in a fortnight: and, to do that, they must only sell for fifty-five, every dollar, you know, increasing ten, as they are thousand-dollar bonds. Take them; you have only to put up five per cent., say two hundred and fifty dollars, and they arc yours. You 'll miss a fine chance, if you don't, I assure you, Stanton!" "I 'll take them, then, at your recommendation," said William. Right; so there they are, Stanton." "IAnd there's your money," said William. "There, Stanton, you have done a thing to-day you will make money on, without fail." "I hope I shall find it so," said William, as he left the officc.   CHAPT ER    XXIII.

SHAKSPEARE. "WHAT makes you look so gloomy and glum, fair sister mine?" asked William, gayly. "Come, you often draw me out when sad; and a change about is always rulable, you know." "I cannot tell you, William; really, I cannot. You must excuse me this time, - the only time, indeed, I ever did deny you the right and privilege of knowing my thoughts and feelings; therefore respect them now, and don't question me." "Nay now, Katie, so much the more reason for my plead- ing, since I have never been denied." "I cannot tell; really, I cannot, William. O, please do not ask me!" "Ah, I know then all about it!

I thought it was not well, judging from your well of tears, Katie darling!" "I mean, what if he has been here?" ( Why, nothing, except that you have seen him." Well?" "Well again, is it? I thought it was not well, according as I understood your reception of him." Then he has told you all?" "Yes, all, Kate. He made honorable proposals to you, and you rejected his suit; and now you are sorry for it." (' I am not sorry I refused him; and yet - " "Ah, yes; and yet-- you love him!" I do, most fondly; and yet I rejected him." "And why, Katie dear?" "I am afraid I have done wrong; but I felt it would be dishonorable to take undue advantage of his love for me. And when I refused him, he looked as if he felt hurt and wounded; and this has made me wretched." "O0, Kate, was it right?" asked William. ("At least, I felt it was right and proper. Consider the difference in our stations in life, in society, and say if I ought to accept his heart and hand, when his course might be higher, and his prize less lowly. Say if his father would have approved his choice of a poor unportioned girl." "( Perhaps not - perhaps not, Kate. You have done right, I think; but you're worthy any good man's taking. I, too, love fondly, passionately; but, ah! how hopeless a love it is!

"Noble girl! I knew you would refuse him; and you are therefore a thousand times more dear to me. Were your positions any nearer each other - were our conditions a very little nore similar, it might have been well; but, bless you, sister, it is better as it is." "I try to feel so," said Kate, smiling through her tears; "but it is very hard." "Were we even rich, Kate - were our fortunes cast nearer theirs, such an alliance might be for the best. For myself, I have my day-dreams, that, should the time ever come when I :  could fold his sister in these arms, and call her mine, my hap- piness would be almost complete; but, alas, she is altogether too far off, I fear; and too many years must elapse before I could enjoy such felicity! Some one of fortune's favorites will inevitably step forward, and bear away the prize, and I can only stand in the background of the picture, and look upon his happiness, and try to call it mine." Let us then, dear brother, live for each other. You are doing well in your clerkship; my needle is still at hand, to add the fruits of its use, and may it be long before I allow it to grow rusty "     f "Dear sister, there is no man, of any discrimination, that might not be proud of you; but he must be proud of you who shall ever obtain your consent to call me brother." "You do not think I did wrong, then?" "I do not, indeed," replied William. 23  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6993-00000134"/> 266        KATE STANTON. "And will you say one word to Charles, in further ex- planation?" "I will, Kate." "Then say to him, I find no fault in him; but I pray for his future happiness." Any one who could look into William's heart, that night, would have read there that he held in higher estimation than ever, that dear sister Kate; and who could blame him? "My sister," thought he, "should marry no one, who might in future feel he was making a great sacrifice in being united to a girl without a ' dot.' She is herself a dowry!"   CHAPTER XXIV. Then is the luck all against me? Go where I will, sure some dirty spider, or other Vermin, has always the upper hand with me. This is the very worst of all unluckies. M MESTIE'S SOLILOQUY. !"Air, Mr. C., my time for holding those cursed bonds is fully up, and how much am I in pocket?  Rather a hard bargain, Mr. C." "I know it is, Stanton; and, I tell you, I am sorry. It is the very devil's luck. Who would have thought that those bonds would have gone down so?  Why, sir, a week ago things looked so flattering that I would have let you off by paying me my commission; but, Stanton, I'll tell you what it is - the devil always seems to help the bears! "So I should think, sir. I don't see how I can blame you; but I hate to have to pay you this loss. Let me see, I gave you two hundred and fifty dollars -that's all gone,; and another like sum besides!" "Well, you needn't feel lhad about it. Why, only three days ago, a customer of mine, who had 'put up' four thou- sand dollars, left this office with only four hundred remaining of it.

My loss is as bad, or worse than his, since his resources were of course larger. But I must try again, I suppose." "Well, I'll tell you what I will do with you. I will get some stock, and pledge it for security; and you need advance but very little,- a mere nominal sum." "What stock?" "Norwich and Worcester railroad. Sure stock, and likely to move soon." "Which way, sir?" ", up, of course. This is no time to sell short." "Then the ' devil is n't going to help the bears just now?'" "I think not. Everything is so flat down, that nobody is selling short at present, but all are holding on for a rise." "What is going to occasion a rise?" "Congress is about adjourning, and when that takes place, and the appropriations are distributed, times will be easy, and things will go up in a flash. This is your time to buy." "If you say so, I suppose it is all right." "Well, it is not always my say-so. You outsiders have often a better opportunity for judging of these matters than we do at the board. ITowever, if you choose to try again, you may do so. Give me a memorandum of what you owe me, making it payable next month some time. I'm not par- ticular just when. I want to favor you some, as your first attempt turned out so badly." "Thank you, sir; and as to the Norwich stock, I 'll think of it, and report." "You better let me take your order now, to buy for you in   KATE  STANTON.         269 thirty days. If I shouldn't, and you see it reported, to- morrow or next day, a little higher, you'll wish you had bought." "Well, get me fifteen shares." "No; that's too small a number. Don't say less than twenty-five." "About what price can you get it for to-day?" "I can buy it for about fifty-eight, or say fifty-eight and a-half, net. When I bought the bonds for you, the other day, this stock was selling for fifty-six; so you see it is doing better already. Better let me take your order." "You may get it for me." "How many?" "Twenty-five shares; as you say you don't want to get me a less number." "Why, no, that is a good quantity; and, among the fancies, such amounts are most obtainable." "Put me down for twenty-five, then. I think I will risk it." And sadly did he risk it. Bad news came from Europe- - the President vetoed some important bill passed by Congress - cotton was down - consols low - heavy failures abroad --trouble at home-"anything, everything," so said the brokers, " to kick down the stock " -the bears made again- the bulls lost heavily, and lame ducks were plentiful. "What makes you so unhappy, William?" said Kate to her brother, as he appeared remarkably gloomy. "Unhappy! and when you are by?" "I think you are unhappy; and you sit so still and moping." 23*  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6993-00000136"/> 270        KATE STANTON. "( Then I will be cheerful." "Something seems troubling you, brother. I wish I knew what it was, I am sure." "tDon't worry about me, Kate. It's all right with me," said William. "Is nothing going on wrong at the store?" "Nothing, Kate." "Then I know there is something the matter somewhere." 'Why?"  's Because, perhaps you are not aware of it, but I often  look in upon you as you sleep, as mother used to do; and  last night you appeared fast asleep enough to be sure, but you  tossed and tumbled about, and kept mumbling, murmuring, and muttering sometlhing-- something, I could not make out what; but it troubled me to see and hear you. Now tell me, dear brother, do." kg Dear sister, I tell you it is nothing, nothing particular.  Some bad dream, perhaps, that tormented me."  "Would I could feel it was only that; but, ah! dear brother,  I am certain there's something not just right within; and  you should have no secrets from your sister." ( Alas!" thought William, c" what shall I do? what shall I say? I cannot, I dare not, tell her the cause of this gloom that she sees too well.

How can I sleep in peace and quietly? My nerves are all unstrung." Evening - night cane.  Again was young Stanton in his chamber; but not to sleep. No; that was denied him now. Sad, sad thoughts filled his breast, and oppressed him there. He threw himself upon the bed in agony of spirit - then rose again and paced the room - then his mind seemed to wander, and his thoughts to stray. From one end of the room he paced to the other- now slowly and steadily, now rapidly and wildly, as thought chased thought across his brain. Again he seeks his couch - he cannot sleep. His sister is in her chamber. She, too, cannot, dares not sleep. A dread of impending evil is brooding over her- she knows not what. Now she hears her brother's heavy tread in his chamber - it joins her own room. "That cannot be innocence " she cried. "O, has he lost all confidence in me? Has a sister no right to a knowledge of his affairs? It must be, there is something wrong. O, hear him walk so furiously! William," said she, "is there no gloom and sadness now?" and she gently opened the door. "Why, sister, what are you up for?" "Why are you up so late?" A little sickness, Kate. I shall be better soon. Do go to bed, dear sister." "O, William, is it only sickness? Surely no sick man would storm about as you have done these three hours past." "Is it three hours?" "Past one o'clock, William.

"Ys, if your mind is calm; but, O, my brother, if any. thing is on that mind, that rests too heavily, let a sister share and lighten it." "It's nothing, Kate; do get to bed!" ";I go, Williaml, but not to sleep, unless you are quiet." "CWll, I an quiet now, and will sleep too." "Good-night!              Y   , "Good-night!"

For an hour lie y there in apparent peace; but tou bitter thougt, was at work;- e could not close his eyes. "O, this is dreadful---horrible! I cannot, cannot bear it! iate must be asleep now; all is still and quiet in the house." Once again he rose, and slowly and carefully opened the  door and listened. He heard no sound. Down stairs as quietly and cautiously. One stair creaked under his tread. Has he a listener? He unlocked the house-door. As the key threw back its guard a slight click in the lock caused him to start. lie listened! All quiet! Ite passed into the street, and shut the door gently behind him.

KATE STANTON.          273 The moon, dimly shining, cast a shadow along the street, and in this shadow some one walked as close to the one in ad- vance as possible without being detected. As Stanton approached the Mill-dam he paused and looked down into the water. "It looks black," murmured he; "but it will not be blacker for receiving one more trust within its welcoming arms. Peace is there at least." Some one touched him  on the shoulder. He turned. Kate! is it you?" "Wlilliam! Willam! is it you?  What are you doing here?" "Only getting some bait for the fishes." "What do you mean, William?" "( I may go a-fishing to-morrow, and I'm looking for a good place. Why did you follow me? This is no time for a woman to be abroad. You must go home, Kate, home." "Not alone, not alone, William!" "Baffled!" muttered he; then he said aloud, "No, Kate; we 'll go together. Why did you trust yourself in the street alone? and this is not the first time, you know." "Love for my brother -for one who will not give me his confidence!" "I can tell you nothing, Kate." "(You could, if you would." "Kate, I cannot; be trustful. All may end well." How? Another night came, and another time of watchfulness and dreaded anticipation, but anticipation only of the future.

A fit of drowsiness stole over her, and she sought her couch, all dressed as she was. At first she would start up suddenly and assume the attitude of a listener; but, overcome at last with weari- ness, she sunk into a deep though troubled sleep. Again William  paced the adjoining chamber.  Sleep refused to return, and lend a blessing; the power to rest and  sleep was gone. Bitter, bitter thoughts flitted through his fevered brain, and something of a choking sensation seemed rising within him.  "I saw C. to-day, and he allows me one more day before :v he says he must expose me. I cannot bear the fact. My brain, my brain! Kate won't watch me to-night. Why,  why? Ha! she cannot! no, she cannot! But, why, why? I say. Yes, why? I drugged her tea! I dare not that she  should watch me to-night; and yet, can I leave her without  a parting look? The dose was powerful; she will not wake  before daylight, and there is still time enough."  William left his chamber, and sought his sister's. Poor girl! how unconscious she lay there! Her face was yet damp with tears; but, O, how quietly she seemed sleeping! He stole carefully to the bedside, and then, stooping over his sister, gently kissed her face. A tear seemed start- ing from her eyes; he wiped it away; then kissed her again. Then he smoothed her glossy hair, as it hung in wild disorder around her cheeks; then, again and again, he kissed that  sleeping form; he knew the strength of the opiate; he feared not that she would wake; yet, as he softly passed his hand over her face, as with sympathetic feeling she gently and sweetly smiled. He could not bear it longer. Once   KATE STANTON. more, and only once more, he kissed her; for one moment took her hand, and twined her still fingers with his own; then m  iurm uring, "'Poor, poor Kate - farewell!" he left theroom as he had entered it. Once more young Stanton gained the street. He crossed it, and looked up at the windows. All was silence there. He then walked hurriedly away. The moon was obscured with clouds, and yet there was light enough for him. Long time he walked, uncertain, as it were,wha course to take. Three tites he returned and passed by the house. Certainly he had not been missed. Then, for the fourth time, he started; this time with more rapid strides than before, and in a different direction,- through the city of Ioxbury, -still he hurried on. Passing up East-street, he hard low voices. He stopped to listen. He was near Putnam's coal-yard; -the voices came from thence, and he went in. Some men were stealing coal there; they ran when they saw him, and appeared to drop into a boat. On, on he walked, -back again towards Brookline; through that village, towards the old Cambridge road; through Cambridge, to Cambridgeport; thence to the bridge. Arriving there, he stepped upon the planking; then waited, paused a moment; then started again, and walked till he reached the middle of the bridge, where the channel is. There he paused again, and looked down once more at the water, as he did the night before. ", It looks dark and chilling; but the struggle will be short; and, then, O peace, peace, and mother!" he muttered to himself.                   e diveted No sister now to beckon back his steps!

"They may be the means of showing where I was last on earth; but what care I whether they find my body or not? Never mind; I'll keep them with me." Just as he was preparing to take the plunge that was to end his woes and misery, his movements were arrested by the sound of fire-bells, and a new thought seized him. "lHe would die in the flames," he said. Running with all the speed he could muster, he once more regained the city; and, by the time the fire had made some progress, he stood before the burning building. He recog- nized it at once. Sheets of flame seemed bursting from the doors and windows; the roof was one mass of fire. Look- ing up, he espied a young woman, at one of the windows of a room which the flames had not yet reached, vainly striving to be heard and rescued. A man in the street was rushing frantically hither and i  thither, and only checked by the crowd from throwing him- self into the flames, in the vain hope of saving his daughter. i    E "Back, back!" cried one and another; "rash man, it is useless!" Ai    i"Ay, say so, all you who have no children in peril!" cried the man. At this moment, all breathless with his unusual exertion, young Stanton dashed through the crowd, and made for the tallest ladder, against the protestations of those below, and rapidly ascended, and was soon lost to view in the burning t-, building. She whom he had come to rescue had disappeared; and, we   IKATE STANTON.  almost blinded with smoke, he called aloud. The crackling of burning timber, and the falling of heated brick and stone, seemed his only answer.

She had fainted in the intensity of alarm, and was a dead weight in his arms. "t They're safe! they're safe!" cried many voices, as the twain were seen on the ladder. One moment more would have been too late, for, just as his feet touched the ladder, and he held in a tight grasp his precious burden, William heard a crash, and, turning around, discovered that the floor of the room he had left had fallen in the ruins. Down the ladder he carefully carried his load, as anxious now to save his own life as before he was ready to lose it; and ere many moments had elapsed, he placed the girl in her father's arms.           a  cclamations long A deafening shout now rent the air, and aclamations long Old Maxwell, for it was he, was too much overcome to speak, but pressed the hand of his child's preserver.

Strange that I should be the means of saving Sarah Maxwell's life! There is some one now who will care for me, and perhaps aid me in my present need." h On reahinig home, he asrain sought his sister's room. Still she lay ill a placid sleep; bu, O, with what differcnt feelings did lie bend over her now! He seemed to have taken a new lease of life. Gently he kissed her, and again smootred down that disordered hair, and combed it with his fingers. At length she awloke and gazed on him. "Is it you, William? '" "It is, dear Katie!" "Where have you been?" said she, as, by the light of early morning, she observed his blackened face. "Fishing!" said he gayly. "Fishing, William?" "Yes, and I 've caught a noble fish, too!"

"So you were the gallant preserver of my daughter," said Mr. Maxwell, as he entered his counting-room the fol- lowing morning. "I had that satisfaction, sir," said William, proudly. How shall I reward your bravery?" "I cannot sell such commodities, sir," said William, in a tone that savored a little of indignation or displeasure. "Nay, now, my dear fellow, I did not mean to undervalue the service rendered; but can I do nothing to aid you, and  express my gratitude for the preservation of one I hold as dear as my life?" "Aid me you can, sir, and to a great degree, provided you will do so as a loan for future payment, not for your present gratitude."

It seemed as though they were ascending to the roof, so high did they climb. The attendant was familiar with the passages, and presently opened a low door, where, by a dim light, was displayed a very dirty and uncomfortable bed, a few very common chairs, and other furniture of the most ordinary character. On the bed lay a man of about thirty-five years of age, although disease and emaciation seemed to claim more years by many. His hollow features, that seemed hardly able to hold together, plainly showed what ravages were there, and how that frame had been torn and wasted. At the bedside sat the good physician, our friend, Doctor Beach. "I am glad you have answered my hasty and unwelcome summons, Mr. Fussell. I would it had been otherwise; but this man has something on his mind, which he is desirous of communicating to you, and. which, he says, you will wish to hear; and, knowing that he cannot have many hours to live, I have consented to disturb you at this early hour." ( No apology is needed, my dear sir; let us, then, lose no time in relieving your patient." "He is asleep now; but, I can assure you, you will not have long to wait." "That form, it appears to me, has borne much hardship and trial; and the man's life has not been a luxurious one." "Far from it, Mr. Fussell. Crime, sir, crime is at the bottom of it all. Depend upon it, he need not to have died at this middle age; it is remorse, sir, remorse! He's waking - now's your time, sir."   KATE STANTON.         283 Has - he -come -doctor?" i He is here, young man." " Where?          ."  "T -ere, sir; and ready to aid you, if I can, young man," returned Mr. Faussell.

The man did go on; and, with an earnestness of expression, and a sincerity, only understood by those who have witnessed a death-bed repentance, related a' sorry account of long years of criminality and vice, to which 1Mr. Fussell was, at first, an indifferent, but, soon, an eager listener. "I am sorry," said Mr. Fussell, "to hear so long a cata- logue of wrong; but I cannot upbraid one who must so soon be in the presence of his God, the great Avenger of all. I will not add to your present anguish and remorse by any chidings; and threats are here of no avail.

His sins and follies will meet such a recompense as the All-wise shall deem fit. For a few moments the old man bent over the form that still lay there; then turned away with a sigh. What was it that for those few moments had appeared to  chain him there? iS i    1 CHAPTER XXVI.                   !

I "STANTON," said Mr. Fussell, "oblige me by meeting me at my residence this afternoon, and bring your sister with you; I want to make her acquaintance.- Mr. Maxwell, you, of course, will be there. I can answer, also, I trust, for your son Charles and his sister." "Cheerfully; it will give them pleasure," replied Mr. Maxwell. "Business requires my absence this morning. Should the Rev. Mr. Parsons call here, appoint a meeting at my house this afternoon. I shall be ready to adjust and settle his claims." "It shall be done as you request," returned Mr. Maxwell. In the afternoon were assembled in the capacious apart- ments of Mr. Fussell's splendid mansion a numerous group. The lovely Kate was there, her beauteous face all glowing with smiles; and the happy look that she gave to Charles Maxwell indicated that she had almost forgiven his rashness.  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6993-00000144"/> 286        KATE STANTON. The gentle Sarah was there, too; and she could hardly keep her eyes from William Stanton, in whom she had discovered her preserver; and the few glances that were passed from one to the other, as their eyes met, were full of hidden meaning. Mr. Maxwell was to be seen, in quiet, though earnest conver- sation with the Rev. Mr. Parsons; but he who had invited these various guests was not present. "What keeps father away, I wonder?" said Ellen to. Clara Fussell. "I don't know," said Clara. "Singular!" replied Ellen. "To invite these guests, and not be here himself, to act the host, is strange." "He has reason," said Marianne. "Any that you are aware of?" asked Clara. "I can guess," replied Marianne. "Does it concern these young folks, or the elder ones, think you?" "Both," said Marianne.  "You see the families are all present, except brother Martin; he has been closeted with father all the forenoon. You know he ate a slight dinner, and they walked out together." "Something is going to happen that concerns us all, I think," said Ellen. "Observe how Aunt Julia is watching first her husband, and then the minister, and then her children and their lovers." "Their lovers!" exclaimed Marianne and Clara in concert -" their lovers!" "Yes; can't you read that riddle?  Don't you see how happy Kate Stanton looks, and Sarah Maxwell, too?"   KATE STANTON.          287  1fi "Here comes father, at last, and with him Martin and the  doctor," replied Ellen. "Good friends, I may owe you all some apology for my  absence, when so many of you are favoring my house with your presence, but it was unavoidable; and, as it is closely connected with a little business I have convoked you all to  aid me in, I trust, when I name it, you will all be satisfied.  Brother Maxwell, you are near the bell; oblige me by ringing   i it." Mr. Maxwell did as he was requested; and there were      i ushered in two gentlemen known to but few of those present. "Be seated, gentlemen," said Mr. Fussell.  ( My good friends," continued Mr. Fussell, "I am glad to see you all, and you are right welcome, young and -middle-  aged. Doctor, you belong to that class, and so does brother Maxwell---yet you both smile.

"Now, my friends, pay strict attention to the facts in the  iI case, which I will briefly run over, as follows:         : "3My old friend, Robert Parsons, a successful merchant,  and a bachelor, as I always supposed he was, died, leaving his  i property in charge of Mr. Maxwell and myself, whom he      f named as his executors.                     ;i "At his death, which occurred about eighteen years ago,    !

Before that time  arrived, however, this will had disappeared,-in fact, was  stolen, with other property, from our safe, and, perhaps, irrecoverably.  "In the mean while, the reverend gentleman present ap. peared and presented claims, of a later date, that seemed to make the other will invalid; and so strong were the proofs  of his veracity, and so perfect his chain of evidence, that i the strict confidence I held in the faith of my old friend Robert Parsons had become somewhat shaken.  That he could marry, and not let me into the secret, was, I felt, an almost unpardonable offence; but before you to-day is his son, and to him must we yield the balance of the property, provided he will give up all claim to the said legacies already distributed and divided according to the will we then had in our possession, and believed to be the only one in existence.  Do you, Mr. Parsons, agree, before these witnesses, peaceably  and willingly to yield all claim to what has already been  divided and distributed according to the tenor of this first, and, as we thought, only will of your- father?" i "Verily, sir, I must do so, since it was done with what knowledge you possessed, and since the parties receiving have so long held these bequests, that to question their right and title would involve too great expense and litigation; though you cannot but readily admit that my claim is good for all that my papers represent; but, gentlemen, it would be oppo- site to the character of my sacred calling, did I presume to   KATE  STANTON.         289 " dictate other than the most generous measures in these pro- ceedings."  ' Taen, sir, and good friends," said Mr. Fussell, "do me the favor to give me your attention to the last will and testa- ment of my old and valued friend, Robert Parsons, of this city, deceased: "(In the name of God, Amen.

If a thunderbolt had shaken the house, the reverend gen- tleman could not have been more horror-struck and alarmed; and Mr. Fussell, observing his disturbed appearance, resumed his remarks. "Ay, Tom Burton! The dying man has spoken out; and I stand here impeaching you! I stand here to unmask you, to charge you with burglary, forgery, and murder!" "The charges are false!" cried the man. "Who is Tom Burton, who Richard lMelcher, that you bring such a tirade against me, because I am in possession of a few sheets of paper, which possession I may be able to account for satis- factorily and fairly?"  Mr. Fussell was not to be deceived, or frightened from his premises, by anything which he felt satisfied was merely bra- vado and cunning.                         ( It is useless for you, sir, to deny your name, or misrepre-  sent your calling.

"Say on, then, base profligate!" "Do you say, old man, that Dick Melcher, on his death- bed, told you all? Do you know whose eyes you closed?"'  "Ha! what say you, villain? Beware how you trifle with me, sir!"                     . "Hear me, old man! That dying wretch was your own      : son! Look back, sir, long years ago. I was once a clerk-- a boy in your counting-room. For some offence against your rules, you discharged me from your employ; and I swore ven-  geance. Bitterly I swore it, and I have got it. Ha! ha!   (i' ha! I have GOT it! Yes, I have got it! Passing your house, one day, I saw in the entrance-way a curly-haired boy, and I knew him for yours. Coaxing him with sugar-plums, I won his confidence-ay, I stole him away. You could not find him in the rags I clothed him in; the large reward you offered for his return or discovery had no inducement for me; and I brought him up as I chose. Yes, old man, as I chose! I  taught him to rob, to steal-ay, and from his father, too!  All that he may have told you is, no doubt, true; but, ha! he did n't know he was pouring the tale into a father's ears! "There, that will do; take me away- take me off! My revenge is complete! Ha! ha! ha!"             h Poor Mr. Fusscll heard but little of all this. At the first  mention that Richard Melcher was his son, he sank, fainting and heart-sick into Dr. Beach's arms; and that kind friend gently placed him on the sofa. His daughters sprang towards hina, and endeavored, in every way, to minister to his needs. What was there in the wretched man's appearance that had   KATE STANTON.          293 brought back in all their freshness the realities of the past? His crimes, his sufferings, his dying looks, had all been vain in disguising from the father, that before him lay one whom he had once known and loved. O, what was there, in those eyes he closed, that had drawn forth so deep a sigh? The prisoner had scarcely been carried away, when the old man became again conscious. Feeling very weak, however, he bade Mr. Maxwell finish the reading of the will, and also state all that had been agreed upon between them. Mr. Maxwell then resumed the reading of the document which had been so singularly restored. Suffice it to say, that, after mentioning that Mr. Parsons had willed to his niece, Emma Stanton, a large portion of his  property, he added that there was bequeathed to her children, on their coming of age, the pretty sum of twenty-five thousand dollars. "'This sum," said Mr. Maxwell, "was scrupulously placed where it could earn a goodly rate of interest; and, as you are a good accountant, William, I need hardly tell you how much it has increased above the first amount. "Soon after your father's unfortunate failure, which involved the greater part of your mother's property, she removed from where you had all formerly lived; and, until a few years ago, we lost all identity of the interested parties. "Had we known of her great need and destitute condition, her wants would have been supplied, and her latter years made more comfortable; but it was not until my son Charles so accidentally met with you, William, on the evening of your  almost fatal wound, that the clue to the whereabouts of your 25*  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6993-00000148"/> 294        KATE STANTON. family was ascertained, and a closer care manifested for your  welfare.                       o "In our subsequent undertakings, we have had the coSper- ation of our dear friends, I)octor Beach and his devoted sis. ter; and, I need not say, further, that your character, and  that of you ler ear ister Kate, have fully realized, yes, more  than equalled our fondest hopes and anticipations. Mr. Fussell joinls Mie in saying, that the business in which we have to- gether been engaged has been a very prosperous one; and, ast we are now growing somewhat mature in years, and are not  quite so active as we were some fifty years ago, though still as successful, perhaps, we have determined to step aside from the road we have togetlcr trodden, and place the helm of our business ship in younger hands, only reserving for ourselves a  pIlace in the old counting-room, where we can look on, and, if need be, occasionally render aid and assistance. What say  you, my young fiiend, to the proposition?" Amazed, gratified, pleased beyond measure with the result of this afternoon's investigation, so far as it concerned him and his sister, William was dumb. He could scarcely mur- mur his thankfulness, but his tearful eyes gave full token of whatt was passing in his heart. "Conme to me," said Mr. Maxwell, gently; and taking Wil- liani's hand in his left, and his son Charles' in his right, he led  them both to where his aged partner was reclining on thel couch, and said: "My young fiiends, we wish to see you   .  united as partners in the house we have so long maintained, and we trust you will always remain side by side, with that steadiness and integrity of purpose which characterize the  upright and successful merchant. Be friends, young men!"   KIATE STANTON. 2.5 "' I need no one to urge me to that, father.

"Willingly," said William, c"do I accept the trust, and fondly hope this friendship may continue long. But there is one thing more. May I venture?" Without waiting for a reply, he gently disengaged his hand from the grasp that Charles held upon it, then, going to where Sarah Maxwell sat, he softly whispered to her, then led her, with much naivete, to her father's side. "May I venture, too?" said Charles smiling, and in a mo- ment brought the yielding, but blushing Kate to the other side, and thus, in a half-circle around the sofa, they all re- ceived an old man's blessing. 4M Iy dear children )" said Mr. Fussell, "I have truly been bereaved of a dear child, and I learn that his life h a been one of unhappiness and wrong; but, O, can I think him guilty, when his whole life, from four years of age, has been passed in such company, and without any instruction except  in vice? But when I see you all so happy around me, and the prospect bright before you, I must, for a time at least, for- get my own sorrows in the general joy.

I 'll have a kiss now, Iatie darling, though at sixteen years of age you tried to refuse me. You need n't look jealous, Charley Maxwell; I don't injure her lips by taking off a pearl."  "Al, Doctor Beach, what a pity you were never married," said Charles, " and had a real right to kiss as much as you  pleased"                           ,: "Nonsense, boy then I could only love one; now I can  love all: and I ant too old a bird to choose a mate.

As Thomas Burton does not appear again in these pages, it may be well enough to state, that his trial took place soon after his arrest, and, but for some informality, he would un- doubtedly have met his deserts on the gallows; but there were, it was said, some collateral circumstances that prevented such a consummation; and he was sentenced for a long term in the state prison. He never escaped again, but, in a few years, he died in his cell, without "pitying friends or lenient foes" to soothe his lonely pillow.

His own name had become hated by him, and, as he grew better, he changed it, that it might not remind others, with whom he came in contact, that he had ever been otherwise than what he became in later years. Ned Akers was forgotten, because he did not come to any- thing worthy of himself, except as an alley-boy, and Burton's assistant in vice; and what became of him was never known. Whether he reformed or not is uncertain; at all events, he was never a representative, senator, or other office-holder, so far as the authoress of this volume is informed.  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6993-00000150"/> CHAPTER      XXVII.

ALL that remained of Richard Melcher, or Richard Fussell   i as he should be called, was borne to its final resting-place, in the sadness of grief. He who had never known in life one pitying friend, -who had never shared the pleasures and comforts of an endearing kindred,-who had never realized the blessings and privi- leges of home, sweet home,- in death was mourned by those    I who would have cherished him living, who would have de-     lighted in leading him to paths of virtue and honor.      J The old wound bled afresh, when Mr. Fussell sadly and     I mournfully accompanied those remains to their lait home;    . and when the sod was placed over them, and he, with his    i family, was returning to his own abode, his grief found vent in bitter, scalding tears. He remembered his boy, as he  3 was in early childhood, when in innocence he played and prat. ; PW   KATIE STANTON.          299 tied; he remembered how sadly he and his helpmate had mourned for him when they believed him dead, and, now that he was really dead, and buried from his sight, he could not restrain himself. "And yet, father," said Marianne, " how much better to feel that he is really at rest at last, where we have laid him, than that, as you have always mourned he might be, he was in some unklnown grave, in the land of strangers!" "True, my child; there is comfort in that; but, O, think what years of pain and sorrow have been mine and your mother's!" "I do, I do, father! but here at least is now certainty. Do you believe that his deeds will be visited upon him in the spirit-land?" "a Dear Marianne, what a question to ask a father! But, yet, I will in some manner reply; and be content if you understand my meaning: ' For unto whomsoever much is given of him shall much be required.' May I not add,--but he who 'has received but little, in this life, of good instruction, the same shall be dealt with gently?" It was a bright and pleasant day when Charles Maxwell with his darling Kate, and William Stanton accompanied by Sarah Maxwell, were walking through Mount Auburn. All was still, and the air was redolent with the perfume of many 'flowers, which kind and sorrowing friends had placed there, in memory of their departed loved ones. As on they rambled, and to Williaml and his sister appar- ently without any special object, other than to view the vari- ous tokens of friendship and regard for those friends who had gone before to a brighter world, they came to a lovely  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6993-00000151"/> 300       KATE STANTON.  nook, where, well sheltered by wide-spreading trees, they be- held a marble monument of beautiful and tasteful proportions. From the appearance of the earth around, it had evidently been there but a short time. As our friends approached the enclosure in which it stood, William and Kate together evinced much surprise and emotion; and, with one accord, but without a word, turned inquiringly to their companions for explanation; for oa that marble tablet they both read the words, "EIMMA STANTON."  "My dear fiiends," said Charles, "this is mother's doing; and it was her wish that you should be led here this after- noon. We have been very anxious to commemorate our mother in this manner. Yes, Kate - our mother; for yours, though now in heaven, is mine, is Sarah's!" O, Charles!" said William, grasping and wringing his hand, " we cannot thank you, but we feel it all-yes, all the kindness that prompted this action, that is to perpetuate her  memory. ,' "Mother must have all the credit that is due for this," said Sarah. "She planned the whole, from the selection and purchase of the lot, to the completion of the monument, and the setting of the fence." "And beautifully and excellently arranged," said William: "Did she plant these fine flowers here?" "No; Charles did that," said Sarah." "They would Ilavc looked much prettier," said Charles, "had they been allowedl time to bloom more fully; but Sarah was so impatient to show what had been done, that I could put her off no longer, and, therefore, came to-day, lest her patience should become exhausted; and, in her hastiness, she   KATE STANTON.          301 should disclose all to you before we could finish our arrange- ments and conduct you here." "I acknowledge it, William; but Charles himself was  almost as impatient as I; so allow for once that, though it may be seldom the case, a woman can keep a secret faith- fully," replied Sarah. As our friends walked slowly away from the beautiful me- morial, a man of about fifty years of age--though care seemed to have written more years still upon his frame- advanced towards the enclosure, and, leaning against the fence, conned the inscription carefully. His beard was long, and what could be seen of his hair appeared quite innocent of all knowledge or acquaintance with a comb. His clothing, coarse in the extreme, was clean and whole, but so patched as to render it difficult, if not altogether impossible, to discover what was the original pattern or color. Long did he remain standing, and evidently trying very earnestly to master the inscription. Then he seemed to mutter to himself, vainly attempting to remember something. So earnest did he seem, and so eager was his gaze upon the tablet, that Charles Maxwell turned to a workman near by, asking if he knew the stranger. The workman replied, that he knew very little of him, that he had been there but a few weeks himself; but that shortly after he commenced his labor, which was that of grading the different lots, the stranger came to him, and, without saying as much as " by your leave," took up a spade, and began to work with him. 26  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6993-00000152"/> 302        KATE  STANTON. "So steadily did he work," said the man, "that I allowed him to continue; and, from that day, he has been so attentive and faithful, that I have regularly paid him good wages. lIe never asked me to give him more; made no bargain, and en. gaged for no time. He enters the cemetery at seven in the morning, and leaves it at six in the afternoon." "Do you know his name?" asked William. "I do not, sir." "Did you ever ask it?" said Charles. "Never; but one day I heard him mumbling and muttering to himself, and he frequently, during that day, repeated the name of Edward. Since then, I have'always addressed him as Edward; and he has thus f:r replied to it." "Is he sane, think you?" "I do not think he is. Sometimes he talks rationally, but knows nothing of his past history; though at times I catch him busily muttering to himself, in a low voice, evidently trying to recall something he seems to have forgotten."  "You say he works steadily?" "Yes; until yonder monument was erected.  Since that time his mind has apparently wandered still more; and very frequently he leaves me, and leans on the fence, as he is doing now, to read and study the words on the stone. Then he appears again to ponder, and, as he returns to his spade, I  hear him repeating--' Emma Stanton--'Emma Stanton.' Then he works briskly awhile; then hies away to the fence again." "Do you intend to employ him much longer?" asked Kate. "Yes, miss; I shall do so as long as I have work for him, for he really needs employment, I know, and he is so willing too."   KATE STANTON.           308 "But," said Sarah, "so many interruptions must annoy you very much, and he cannot be worth as much to you as he was at first." t As to that, miss, I don't mind it, as he works so much faster, after he has made each visit, that I think he makes up  the time lost while he is away. He's coming now. Observe  how he mutters as he walks along. You can see his lips move. Hark!" "Emma Stanton -Emma Stanton-- Emma Stan-- yes, a very pretty name. She must have been very handsome,- Emma Stanton - I wish my name Was Emma Stanton- she must have been a good-- yes, Emma Stanton - Emma-- that sounds well-.I wish I could remember - I wish I could remember-" "You seem to like that name," said Charles, addressing him. "' Like what name?" "Why, the name on the stone there, that you just came froIm." "O, on that stone! Yes, on that stone - yes, a very good stone, a very nice stone- a very good stone, and a good name on it, too. Don't you think so, young man?" "I do!" replied Charles. "So do I; but I am losing time, young man - losing time - yes- Emma Stanton -Emma-- I'm losing time," said the man, again seizing his implement and working, as if he thought he could call back and overtake the flying moments of time. There was something very strange in this circumstance; this man, this insane man, to be so pleased with an inscription  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6993-00000153"/> 304        ICATE STANTON. on a stone in a cemetery, and to reverence it so highly. Kate thought so; so did William, and so thought they all, and they wondered what it meant; but Kate pondered more than all. What could it mean? "William," said Kate, after a pause, "try to make the man talk of the past." "I will try what I can," said William, and, approaching nearer to him, he beoan  "You are a stranger in these parts, sir; are you not?" "A stranger- a stranger?" "I mean, do you live about here?" "Not among the tolmbs-not among the tombs--not Elmma - Emma - Stanton -   " Tell me, friend; do you live near here?" "Friend!"I have no friend.  Ha! ha! that's a good one. Friend! ha! ha! ha! I don't live anywhere." (WThat is your name?" "Edward - young man- Edwarld." Your other?" I don't know!" ( Not know your name?" "I never had one, sir--never had one--they call me Edward - or Ned, if you choose- " "Have you no recollection," said Kate, gaining courage, "have you no remembrance of other days, when you were young yourself?  The poor man rubbed his forehead, and seemed lost in thought; then spoke aloud: "Never, miss, never!"   KATE  STANTON.         305 "Try to think, poor man. Think if you never had any one who was kind to you, who cared for you. Think if ever there was any one who nursed you when sick, who watched over your pillow when you were suffering." "No, young lady; none." :' Come," said William to his sister, "it is growing late, and we must return to our homes." "Yes; unless I can make this man remember something." "It must be useless, miss," said the workman. I have tried him myself, but all without effect." "Then, sir, promise me you will, by some pretext or other, detain him in your service till you hear from one of us again," said Kate. (I will try to do so; but he came to me suddenly, and he may leave me as he came. To-day he is here; to-morrow I cannot answer for his making his appearance." "Then," said Kate, " take measures to watch him, and find out where he lodges, any way, so that he may not escape so far that you cannot retain knowledge of his whereabouts, and youePshall be remunerated for all the trouble it may cost you. lie interests me, and I am willing to bestow some care myself upon him.

"COME, Dr. Beach, put up the Materia Medica and Dis- pensatory, and listen to me," said Kate, as she returned from 3Mount Auburn. "Why, lass, what's the matter? You look rosy, and you are as excited as if Charley Maxwell had just popped the question, instead of your being lovers engaged lang syne. What do you want of your old bachelor friend?" "Doctor, don't think I am crazy; but, if the thing is not altogether absurd, I really believe I have found a father at last, and not dead neither!" "God be praised! But, Katie darling, can it be? Have a care, child! Don't let your hopes carry you so high, that disappointment will be rendered the keener and more un- bearable. Better far he were dead, as we have always believed him to be, than to think him alive, only to mourn about him. But what do you mean, child?"   KATE  STANTON.         307 Kate related what had passed at the cemetery, and the im- pression she had received from the conversation and the man's appearance; and she entreated the doctor to accompany her on the following day to aid her in pursuing, if possible, the investigation. ( How do you mean to proceed, Kate? Have you any clue or proof to bring to your aid in this business?" "Very little, really, doctor; but a strong conviction that this man, though in a very sorry plight, is indeed my father." "Have you any memento, anything left by your mother, that your father may ever have seen, or cherished, as belonging to her?" ' Yes; her miniature and wedding-ring." "The best means that I know of, Kate. The most certain instruments we can use. Won't your brother accompany us?" "His duties and engagements will not permit him to do so." To-morrow came. Kate, and her friend, the doctor, pro- ceeded to Mount Auburn. On arriving, she directed his attention to the monument her friends had placed there in memory of her mother, and were fortunate in finding the stranger at work as before. As our fiiends drew near, he appeared to recognize Kate; and, as if he thought her approach was for the purpose of visiting him, he stood apparently deliberating whether or not to fly; but reassured, by her looks of kindness and good-will, he resumed his spade. "There, doctor," whispered Kate; "I call that man my father. Am I mad, think you?" "Mad! Katy darling. Heaven forbid!" "But do you think he looks like-   &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6993-00000155"/> 308        KATE STANTON. "Like you, are you going to say? Let him make his face resemble more that of a man, and less that of a bear, and I'll answer you according to my judgment." "Nay, doctor; nay, now, be charitable, pray!" urged Kate. "Charitable, Kate? Who the devil (I beg your pardon) could be charitable, to see such a mug as that man carries, and hear you talk of calling him father! I shall grow very jealous, Kate, very jealous, indeed, if you bring me here again to help you claim any one, who may soon take my place as second in your affections-- your Charlie being, of course, the first!" "Don't fear, dear doctor; you have indeed always been a father to me; but, surely, if any one needs my love and duty, you will not object to my bestowing both." "Not if any one can establish a fair claim; but look you, Katie, you have never known a father - have always lived as if you felt that he had long ago perished. In fact, you have as good as given up all idea of ever seeing him in life; and now you say that you think that yonder being is the iden- tical parent." "No, doctor, I have never given up all hope of his return- ing. I have always trusted, though perhaps unreasonably." ( Well, where's he going now?" said Dr. B. "To the enclosure," replied Kate, as the man renewe his visit. "He goes there very frequently, his employer sais, and-observe his lips in motion.  Let us approach him."

"Look here, my friend, what's your name?" "Edward, sir, or Ned, as you choose, as you please." "Your other name; what is that?" "I don't know!" "Don't know! What do you mean?" "I never had any.

"Do as you will, Kate! do as you will!" "Tell me, poor man, did you never have any children to be happy with; no bright smiling faces to look up into yours; no lovely and affectionate little ones to sport by your side, and climb your knee? Did you never have a dear wife who loved you?" "I don't know; - I don't remember any." "Has every one deserted you? Was there never a heart that seemed to beat with yours?" "I don't know!

It is said to be a fair likeness of the original face," said Kate; and she earnestly watched his countenance, as she displayed her mother's pic- ture full before his gaze. Long, long he looked, and then rubbed his forehead; then looked again; then rubbed his forehead; then looked once more; then uttered one piercing shriek, that reached the very hearts of his listeners, and which they never forgot; then fell fainting to the ground!

Doctor Beach, with the assistance of the workman, placed the unconscious stranger in a carriage, saying, as he did so, "Retain anything that may be due this unfortunate man, as an offset for this very unceremonious and abrupt departure; if you are in his debt, consider it discharged. I assume his guardianship for the present at least. If he has agreed for any unexpired time, name the forfeiture, and I will meet it willingly." "There's nothing, sir," said the man; and they drove away. Some hearts in that vehicle beat rapidly!

"HE sleeps now,' said the doctor, " and, I think, will, on awaking, know more of the past, though he may awake only to be delirious." The sufferer was lying in a room in the doctor's own home - Kate Stanton's room. It was furnished with Kate's own furniture her mother's formerly. The chair, twice already mentioned, the old table, both were there; the old chest, that had always occupied a corner, and the bedstead, now adorned with one of the two quilts spoken of before. Every- thing was neatly arranged; and Kate hoped these would re- call to the poor man's bewildered mind some faint shadow, some dim recollection of former years. For two days had he lain there, sleeping, or dozing,-it could not be called sleeping,- much of the time. From the fainting- fit he had apparently passed to a sort of dreamy state, ac- companied with fitful starts, as something seemed to flit   KATE STANTON.     -     31 across his brain. On the second day he became more easy, and his sleep apared calm and peaceful; and this gave the doctor much to hope for, and much encouraged the children. "He is waking," whispered the doctor.  "Kate, place  yourself opposite to him, where his first glance must rest."  She did as the doctor requested, and had scarcely taken her position when the man opened his eyes, and saw her at  once. "O, Emma Emma! I 've had such a dream!" said he.  "Father, it is not Emma."  "Not Emma!  Who is it, then? Am I dreaming still?  Then I would be again, for it was delightful. Who are you,  if not my Emma,--my darling wife?"               1 "Dear father! look at me -your daughter!" "It cannot be; my child is small-a little tot of a  thing." "I was small once, father, but it was long ago! :" - "No, no! it cannot be!  What do you mean by long ago? I am sure you are my Emma. Your features are  hers; your face her own. Why do you mock me?"          L "My dear father, look at me; is there nothing to re-  mind you of your little Katie? You must be my father! I know you are my father. I have mother's features, I know." "No, no! I tell you my child was small; a little thing, just able to climb my knee, and play bo-peep in my dressing- gown." "Dear, dear father! that must have been long since. You 27 I- t'  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6993-00000158"/> 314        KATE ST ANTON . have been away, and have just come home. I never knew you; but I feel and know you are my father " "Have I been away?" "O, yes, father, these many years; for I have forgotten how you looked, but William has your miniature." "William! who is he?" Your onvn William, father!" said he, coming to the bed- side; "your own son." "Don't, don't mock me! I don't know either of you. I want my Emma, and surely you are she!" ("No; I am not your Emma; she is in the spirit-world, and all that remains of her here lies at Mount Auburn." "Is my Emma gone? -is she then dead?" "She is, father; we trust she rests in heaven!" Another shriek, and again the unhappy man relapsed into insensibility. "This will not do, doctor," said William; "this must not be. lie will never be better than he now is; he will never remember us!" ( Be patient, my friend, be patient; let him rest awhile; one more season of sleep may work a great change, and I trust it will. Preserve all your fortitude, both of you. The trial is a severe one; but only nerve yourselves to endure, and you will surely succeed. He has caught your mother's looks in your face, Kate, and that augurs well, in fact, as well as I could have expected, and, indeed, better than I feared. Therefore, be patient, both of you." They both promised, and were well rewarded, for when Edward Stanton again roused himself, his memory itself was rousing. Long years of adversity, like Macheth's line of   KATrnE STANTON.         315 ghostly kings, came up in procession before him. He remem- bered his wife as she was before he left his home; his chil- dren as they were then, mere little prattlers. Then he re- membered his departure; but his brain was evidently quite weak, and much time must elapse, the doctor said, before it could be taxed with safety. Kind treatment and gentle nursing were what Edward Stanton needed, and these he now received, abundantly, from  willing hands and devoted hearts. His was no slight disease,   i no simple alienation of mind, but the result of years of mis-  ery and neglect. From what could be gathered, at times, when the misty  curtain appeared to be lifted from the poor man's feeble mind, his friends learned that, during the first few months of his absence from home, he had met with continued reverses and discouragements, and these finally produced a severe and serious brain fever, which, while it threatened to end his life and misery at once, left him in imbecility and weakness. His earlier years had become a blank page to him; memory had left its throne, and the sufferer had become awanderer and a forlorn outcast. Strangers took pity, at first, and lent him aid; they soon tired, however, and instinct--not reason, for that had flown--alone supported him, and showed him the means for obtaining a precarious support. Where he had been, for a number of years following his illness, was quite uncertain, as he could give but little explanation. As he recovered his mind's vigor and strength, he spoke of inci- dents which had occurred to him, by which his friends  learned how much he had endured --how severe had been his sufferings and privations; but now that he had reached y't ' ^  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6993-00000159"/> 316        KATE STANTON. that happy haven of rest and peace, - that abode where dwelt his loving children,--his want and destitution were alle- viated, his distress removed. It is unnecessary to dwell upon Edward Stanton's recov- ery and restoration. As his mind gained strength by repose and quiet, the varied scenes through which he had passed became at length linked together in his memory, until the chain was complete and entire. Truly did he mourn the loss of his Emma, who, though long since departed, yet lived in his Kate --his daughter. On her face he, in fancy, traced the features of his dear wife; and, as he wept in bit. terness of grief, she mingled her tears with his, while she used every means to comfort and console him. "' And you, my children, are spared to me. I thank God for that. HE has not left me altogether desolate and alone! I can realize I have been away so long, only when I hear two such children call me father! They, that I left so small and young, to have arrived at maturity! - but I dare not reflect upon it. I feel that my brain is not sufficiently strong for the effort, and I must forbear." "You need not, father; save your strength," said William; "we only wait now your entire restoration, to aid us in our marriage services and ceremonies." "Then am I to lose my Kate, now that I have just found out who and what she is? Am I to part again so soon with my children?" "No, father, no! Live with us; and may your declin- ing years be peaceful and happy, passed in our midst. So may you forget all that should be forgotten and ob-   KATE STANTON.          317 literated, and only cherish what may be cheerful and agree- able." "But not to live in idleness, children; that will never do. I must not be a burden and a check upon you, my dears!" "' Talk not of that, dear father! It will be time enough to lament when we complain; so see who tires first!" 27*  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6993-00000160"/> I CHAPTER XXX. The gallant bridegroom, by her side, Beheld his'prize with victor's pride; And the glad mother in her ear Was closely whispering word of cheer. TIiE LADY OF THE LAKE. WITH Edward Stanton's recovery came the marriages of his children; and as they stood side by side, and plighted their vows of faithfulness and affection, the hearts of those present seemed to beat in unison, and one prayer for their continued and unending prosperity was breathed by all. They were happy hearts, that day, that assembled in the old family mansion of Mr. Fussell, by his express invitation and urgent request - Mr. Maxwell's house not having yet been rebuilt. Happy indeed were those gathered there, both middle-aged and young. The venerable doctor was there, though to call him vener- able seemed almost ridiculous. Why, he was the youngest of the party-only afew years past sixty. His quaint and prim sister was present, talking very learnedly, though a little offended, however, that the young folks should be so sinful as to think of marrying; - she never had (perhaps she could n't).   r 8319 KAT   STA ANT ON ",She did n't see," she said, " why others nee be in such a Shrry about fastening the connubial GorFian-complicatea entanglement; that it as lamentable institution to incidate so unseasonably in their animated existence, " Of course everybody laughed at this speech, and Nancy become at length composed and recondiled to the change, and joined in their glee.              at  e The good doctor was unillin to iel   up his "Katie aarling" evet to her husband; but she smilingly told him he couldn't hp himslf and he thought so too; his sister Nancy retinded him of the poet, -ho said he never had a young gazelle" that did n't run away or die just as h had become attached to its society. The old mansion at N. was refurnishec; though Sarah Maxwell (now Sar Stanton) would not listen to any attempt towards alteration of the house itself. It had sufficed for her parents for many years, with only such repairs as the ravages of time required and demanded, and she would hear tono amendment for her. Her mother had alwa ys promised that the house should be hers on her marriage, and that promise was now fulfilled; and thither she went with William Stanton, immediately after the mrriage-service, not even first per- forming that foolish, though fashionable custom, a wedding journey.                      . Opposite the old manson,an at he other end of the six acres, had been erected a house for her brother Charles and his Kate; and thither they repaired as sensibly as the other couple had gone'to theirs t of that felicit Here, then, we leave them to the enjoyment of that felicity which only faithful hearts and affectionate dispositions can  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6993-00000161"/> 320        KATE STANTON.  achieve and enjoy. Here on the threshold of their married existence let them pause, and agree that no cloud, of their own construction, shall rise to mar and disturb their bright and cheerful prospects; that no hasty word, or no word capable of double-entendre, shall ever be uttered, to brinn disagreement and disaffection among them. Edward Stanton lives with his children-sometines with hils son, sometimes with his daughter; and it is extremely difficult to ascertain, with any degree of certalnty or exact- ness, to which house he actually belonlls. ie, at the very outset, demanded and obtained the exclusive privilege of keeping the yards and gardens, in the immediate vicinity of the houses, in perfect order, and good condition, leaving to the old servant, Mike, the charge of the heavier labor of the farm, which was cultivated in common for the consumption of' both households. Dr. Beach, who had determined to retire from the arduous  duties of his profession, has taken a house near his prot6ges,  that he may always hold them in recollection, as he remer  bets the old adage, i"Out of' sight, out of mind;" though he  says he thinks , his Katie darling will not entirely forget her old friend;" but he does not attempt to kiss her now, lest Charlie Maxwell should become jealous," though he is old enough to be her grandfather." Nancy, of course, lives with him; and though she has not holly forgiven her young friends for seeking new acquaint- nces, yet she does occasionally make some ceremonious halls, and tries to be quite sedate, and somewhat distant in her la:ners. But William laughs at her, and then she becomes ,rceable, and throws away her erudite incongruities, and    KATE STANTON.          321 becomes, what she really is when 'she chooses, a sensible and pleasant companion. Mrs. Bentley has made one of her disagreeable calls upon the new-comers, perhaps with the hope of some day being needed; but they remember her former unpleasant visits, particularly when Kate lay so helpless on the sofa, years gone by, and will now have nothing to do with her, though, for peace sake, they treat her kindly, and with a degree of  cordiality. Mrs. Towne and family had become quite familiar in the houses of our friends. Their visits being generally, it seems, to see what they had in the house, what dresses they wore, and to borrow patterns. The young doctor's wife, in particular (Mrs. Towne's daughter), wanted her husband to get her something just like what Sarah Stanton had; and he said, "Now, sweety-wifey, you must have a dress like that; and, sweety-wifey, you must have a collar like Kate Maxwell's." For some time it was a pleasure for our friends to keep up much social intercourse with the Townes; and William Stanton and his sister Kate were ever ready, when needed, to nurse them when sick, and to perform many little neighborly attentions for them when possible, convenient, or necessary. This was all very well, until one day, a new family, very con- genial in their character, moved into the neighborhood; and because our young friends visited them, and found them sociable and agreeable, the Townes became miffed, as the term goes, and agreed to part. Our friends were not sorry to drop the acquaintance, as now they could have what cups and saucers, and even plates, in the house, they chose or needed, without their being  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6993-00000162"/> 322       KIXATE  STANTON. counted, or the inquiry raised as to " whether they were theirs or borrowed." Mr. Maxwell and family reside hard by their old home- stead. Mr. Maxwell, tired of trying to reform those who have seemed for years content to live on and on, as they pleased, without plrogressing or advancing one jot or one tittle from their old self-appointed way, has determined to let the village take care of itself, while he and his family, Dr. Beach and sisters and the two young couples, together with the new congenial family just spoken of, - who, by the way, is that of a young lawyer of great promise,--form a sort of coterie by themselves. Thus they let the world wag on as it will, and cherish those sympathies which congenial spirits so well understand, and happy, contented hearts so finely appreciate. 3Mr. Lane, the minister, --the cold, unsocial man; the preacher, but not the pastor, - has, to the surprise of the whole neighborhood, even deigned to notice this little colony, and even to visit, to call upon its members. Some say he is really waking up, and may, if he is allowed to live long enough, some time come to be worth something as a spiritual adviser and fiiendly counsellor; though, to be this, he must reform  his entire nature, and remodel his whole being; for Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs from thistles?" The elder Mr. Fussell, preferring a city residence, and be- coming well advanced in years, chooses still to occupy the old family mansion in the city, where he is well cared for by his affectionate children. At his father's request, and remembering the dying wish of his mother, Martin Fussell has given over all idea of sea-life; and, with his devoted wife, shares the same   RATE STANTON.          323 house and home, where with his sisters he maintains "watch and watch" over the welfare and interest of his surviving parent. The Adrian has been repaired, and is now owned by other parties, and is still a stanch craft, The old and weather-beaten sign is still allowed to hold the same place which for nearly fifty years it has maintained, and served to mark where deeds of uprightness and integrity were strictly performed. The old sign has held its place, while many of its neighbors have changed their coatings and their character; and the young successors to the old and respected firm agree that it shall still serve as an ancient landmark not to be removed; but, on each side of the main entrance may be seen a bright and handsome board, bearing, in letters not to be mistaken, MAXWELL &amp; STANTON. Long may the new firm continue to prosper, and long may it maintain the character and high reputation which have ever marked its predecessors! And may those bright and golden letters be all effaced and obliterated from the boards they now adorn and beautify, ere one blot, or one blemish, shall light upon the fair fame of their owners and possessors!  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6993-00000163"/> CHAPTER XXXI. "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, anrd where thieves break through and steal ; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven! For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." KATE IMAXWELL, who had ever been a kind and loving sister, a dutiful and affectionate daughter, was now a fond and devoted wife. But she was more than these. Nurtured, as she had been, with care and attention, she had imbibed from her fond parent all those requisite qualities which aid her now in becoming a Christian mother. Two beautiful buds of promise, that only bloomed for a brief period, withered and wasted away; two gentle beings, before they could lisp the endearing name of mother, were removed from earth, to become dwellers in the spirit-land - and a third child was born to her; but it seems doubtful whether its hold upon life is sufficiently strong to warrant the hope that it may be spared to arrive at maturer years. Affliction is ever hard, and the pangs of parting with those we love are always heavy and severe; and to those who have not the hope and promise of the gospel truths to cheer and illumine their gloom and heartfelt dreariness, death comes with   KATE  STANTON.         325 increased terror, and appalling reality. But those whose lives have been framed with a lively hope that heaven is a resting-place for the released soul, see the messenger enter their abode without flinching and without faltering. Yet the heart will cling to those we love and cherish; and, with all of Christian devotion, or worldly philosophy, the bit- terness of grief is difficult to be borne. Kate found it so. She tried to feel that it was the will of a merciful Providence; but, though her heart did not rebel, yet she felt how weak it was; and nothing, save the reflection that she should one day join her loved ones in heaven, and with them be at rest, sufficed to buoy her up, and nerve her to her duty. As she watched her remaining child, as it lay in her enfold- ing arms, she could not but notice how frail a thing it was; and she sighed as she thought and feared she might be called upon to place this also in its kindred earth; and she sobbed a prayer to the Father of all for His protection and guardian- ship. It still lives, and may it long live, to be a comfort and a solace to its afflicted and desolate parent! William sat alone. His wife was attending to some domes- tic duties that required her immediate notice; and, as he mused on the events of past years, a little prattler, of four years of age, came bounding into the room, and scrambled to his lap. It was their only child, and they loved the boy with intense affection; and the little one knew it, too, as he nestled in his father's arms. 28  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6993-00000164"/> 326       KATE STANTON. As William held him there, the little fellow had much to say about his merry sports and infant pastimes, and his father listened to him with infinite delight; but yet his whole atten- tion did not appear to be fixed upon his child; and, boy-like, the young thing was not long in making the discovery that his father was not as mindful of what he was telling him as he evidently thought he ought to be. "It rains, father," said the little one; "and my face is all wet." "( No, my dear, it does not rain in the house." "Why, it does, father; only see my cheek!" Then, looking up into William's face, he said: "And it rains on your face, too, father!" William bent forward, and kissed his lovely boy. "O, father, the rain is on my face again, and it is dropping from yours!" "What do you think it is, my boy?" '. Now I know; but I did n't know that big, large folks cried. I thought only little boys and girls cried, father." "Large folks cry, too, my child." "Well, then, Aunty Katie cries, too; the rain runs down her face most all the time!" "i Do you know what she cries for, Charlie?" "Yes, grandpa' told me. But I didn't think it was crying." "What did he say?" "Because my little cousins are dead!" "Yes, my dear boy; but do you know what that means?" No, father; but grandpa' says I shan't ever see them   KATE STANTON.          327 again, and then I cried, too. What made them be dead, father?" (' Because God wanted them, Charlie!" "Was he good, to want them, father?" "Yes, my dear." What's he going to do with them?" "He wants them to live with him, Charlie." "Where does he live?" "Away, above the clouds you see, up in the sky." "How did he get up there?" "Dear boy, I cannot answer that!" "Shall I ever see my little cousins again?" "I hope you will, some time." "When, father?" "When God wants you, too, Charlie." "When will that be?" "I cannot say, darling!" "Will it be to-morrow, father?" "I hope not, dear one, so soon as that. You don't want to go away, and leave father and mother, do you?" "No, father; but won't you come, too?" "Some time, dear, some time." "Is grandma' there, father?" "I trust so, my dear boy." "Was that what made you cry, father, when I came to sit in your lap?" "No, dear, not that." "What was it, father?" "I was happy, darling!" "Why, father, happy, and cry, too?"  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6993-00000165"/> 328        KATE STANTON. "Mine were happy tears, my boy: I was thinking of you, Charlie!" And so he was; but only as following a long train of thought. William had been revolving in his mind the inci- dents of his life;-his mother's death, his own unrighteous imprisonment, his return to happiness and friends, his unfor- tunate and almost fatal speculations, when impending ruin stared him in the face, and death stood before him, as he hesitated to take the plunge that was to end his misery. Then he thought of succeeding incidents; and, while he thanked God that he was spared, he shuddered as he remem- bered that awful night when he stood with his eyes riveted on that black and gloomy river. Then he thought of the moment when he rescued her who finally became his beloved wife; and, as he held his child and hers to his bosom, it "rained down his face " in very joy at his altered life and feelings. "Thank God! thank God!" he inwardly cried; "yes, thank God, who has spared me, I hope and trust, for wiser and better purposes! "O, cursed stocks! wretched speculations! foolish and wicked bartering of the real and certain for the false and doubtful! "O, how many of those I have known, who have died sud- denly, been found drowned, or who have been found in bed dead,' as the coroner will have it, with 'some disease of the heart,' that really ended their lives because they did not dare hold them, and be known as having been ruined, body and soul, by the accursed STOCK EXCHANGE!

"Yes, thank God," said William, "I am yet alive; and, with His blessing, far above temptation! I bought my expe- rience-yes, and I paid for it, too, by seasons of bitterness and woe, by hours of despair and wretchedness! Ah! I can read stock-quotations now without a wish, without one desire, to traffic in the commodities they present to notice.

Why, then, a final note prolong, Or lengthen out a closing song, Unless to bid the gentles speed, Who long have listed to my rede? "ENVOY. MAIMON. YES, why prolong a final note, or lengthen out a narrative which hmay have already reached a fitting stopping-place? I would fain have pictured my dearest friend Kate as sur. rounded with every luxury and comfort that wealth could purchase -a happy and cheerful mother; but truth warns mle to forbear. I would show her to the reader as a gay and lovely girl, still youthful and hopeful -and hopeful, indeed, she if; but of that hope which affliction brings, that last gift to mankind from an all-dispensing Providence. Devotion was hers; religious truths were her consolation and solace; and as, with tearful eyes and a throbbing heart, she looked beyond her gloom, she felt herself in presence of an Almighty Power, and to Him she prayed with a fervor which is only known to the suffering and thes-opressed in spirit. Now came to her remembrance the many useful lessons her   KATE STANTON.          831 mother had taught her, -the many years of conflict and dis- tress that fond mother had borne, when her own husband, Kate's father, was a wandterer. The tracing hand would still' dwell upon the exalted char- acter of the good old doctor, the dear, dear friend of Kate. I would direct attention to him, as he still administers conso- lation and words of comfort to that sickening, that fainting heart - that heart he knew so well of old, when she, a girl of seventeen years, had only to express a wish, to have it granted freely, and so heartily! There is a balm for those who weep, a help for those who sigh; and this the good physician proved, and gave his sympathy with no stinted hand. I would one moment pause, to see a group assembled on the little old bridge, where the stream runs so merrily, so laugh- ingly, along over the stones. I see there Charlie Stanton, now but six years of age, coaxin is baby cousin to play with him, and the wee thing scarcely able, from her very littleness, to toddle along; and Charlie feels all the grandness of so superior an age, as he acts the part of guide and chaperone. Grandmother is there - Grandmother Maxwell; and with what fondness and admiration she gazes on the darlings! Kate is there, leaning fondly on her husband's shoulder, and directs his attention to the children, too, and sighs because theirs is so puny; and Charles says nothing, but, with a fond glance at his beloved partner, points with his finger upward to the skies, where so many of their treasures are! "I know it, I know it, Charles, and they are happy there; but O, why need we be so desolate?" "Ah, my children," said Mrs. Maxwell, approaching them,  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6993-00000167"/> 332        KATE STANTON. "ah, indeed! look up; but only with thankfulness on your hearts, for there is peace at last!" "True, O true!" said Kate; "if I could so read a les- son of faith and submission! When I can feel that the spirit- world and this are closely connected, and firmly joined, with bands invisible, but strong, then may I feel that the transition is brief, and then may I look forward with a livelier hope to immortality." "And there place your hope, Kate," said her father, "as I do; that where there is no more sorrowing, no more sighing, no more wandering, THERE we may meet those we love, who have only gone before us to prepare for our coming, that we may join them in the realms of glory, even to everlasting life!" The little stream still journeys on, ripples on, till, the wide ocean reached, it mingles with its mighty waters. Each drop in this rivulet is blended and lost in the boundless tract of water- still this gentle stream is running on, coursing on! Our souls still journey on, travel on, till, reaching that happy state, the great unknown Eternity, each finds its place, its sphere; not lost, like the drop of the streamlet, in the vast ocean's tide, but each soul is there distinctly known and acknowledged as a burning and a shining light!   i    &#xD;</p>
