ELECTROTYED AT THE BOSTON STEREOTYE FOUNDRY, NO. 19 SPRING LANE*    "FE AND A TONE. CHAPTER I. IT was dusk, - that dim, dull hour which shuts out day, and precedes the social candle-light. Within a small room, into which opened a large closet ar- ranged with shelves to serve the purpose of divers apartments for a play-house, and crouched upon the floor, beside the open closet, was a young girl. It was her wont to sit there at that hour, gazing vacantly upon the many toys strewed around, with thoughts wandering far from play or playthings. It may be that constant solitude gave her a disrelish for them, or that the long-indulged habit of thinking and talking to herself prevented her finding the least pleasure in things which one might imagine would interest a girl only twelve years of age. Death, the grave, sorrow, eternity, with its mys- * (s )  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7083-00000003"/> 6-    b    LIFE AND ALONE. teries,--all were themes for thought in her young mind; and she indulged in earnest longings for an indefinite something, hardly assuming shape sufficient  to be called hopes, being only faint tracings of a fu- ture; peculiar, because the burden of an older heart with which childhood should have nought to do. Wearied of her silence, at length she gave expression to her thoughts thus, aloud : -- "My mother I I wonder she should be so sad.     How little she seems to - love her home or me I In- deed, if she were not a Christian, I might think my- self almost an object of hatred to her; so cold every word and look she bestows upon me. Alld father too-his lot seems hard and strange. 'What mean the dark sayings thrown at him? And those long hours my mother sits weeping? Indeed, I pity her too. Kind words, one caress, would make me more  than pity, even love her. Alas I life is very wretched. I do not see that my mother's religion makes her any happier. The Christian's faith is hers; but it does not banish sorrow. She trusts in God, but faith-- what is it? It does not always make the person happy; yet if we pray for anything, believing in the power and willingness of the Almighty to grant our desire--that is faith, and our prayer must be an- swered. We know it will, and that knowledge is   "FE AND ALONE.        7 trust. I think I will pray that we may all be happy to-night, have no hard words or tears, believing -all the time, as I wish, that it will come to pass." Then, as she had done often before, yet perhaps now with a stronger effort to lose all other thoughts in earnestness, Edith Merton, the heroine of our story, knelt and uttered the simple petition that God. would command harmony to reign in her narrow home circle; that father, mother, and daughter might be happy in each other. Then, trying to believe her prayer was heard, Edith went down to the sitting- room. One little scene will serve to describe home life, "Where is father," exclaimed Edith, on entering the room. "Hasn't he come home yet?" "No. Your supper is ready," was the mother's response, in a cold, chilling tone. "Shall I have something for supper beside bread and milk to-night? I do hate that so r " "No; you are too dainty to live. Eat what is set before you, or go to bed." "I should rather go to bed without nly supper than to eat this stuff." "You may see the day "-and a tear glistened in the mother's eye as she spoke--" when a piece of bread may seem a luxury."  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7083-00000004"/> 8        LIFE AND ALONE. That tear- how it smote upon the child's heart! Had she dared to show the feeling, she would have thrown herself upon her mother's neck, and wiped away the tear which perhaps her petulance had caused; but how, thought the little one, would any mark of'affection be received when she seems so cold and stern? Thus the fear restrained her, and the little act which might have stamped Edith's life with a. new aspect altogether, was never indulged in- this time a mere thought, a golden moment lost. The prayer came back to her mind, and questions succeeded as to its use. The simplicity of childhood's trust in God was marred by doubts, and the evening meal was finished in gloomy silence. The mother sat at the table pale, statue-like; yet her face was beautiful to look upon, and always there was something fascinating in the high-bred repose of her manner. She wore a black silk dress of a sort of wrapper-like make, confined at the throat with a diamond cross. A black cord with tassels was drawn tightly around her waist, the sleeve fitted close to her arm, and she wore neither collar nor cuff to relieve the sombre hue of her dress. Massive waves of jetty black hair were parted upon her fore- head, carried back above her ear, and confined very low and loosely by an exquisitely wrought gold comb   "FE AND ALONE.        9 of antique fashion - the hair almost lying upon her neck behind. - er eye, sunken but very black, seemed to reveal a world of thought, and its slightest glance was full of expression. Her form was slim and graceful, yet comprehending one's whole idea of dignity in its every movement. The usual expres- sion of her face was a deep-settled melancholy, sel- dom relieved by even the shadow of a smile. Her voice was loud and clear-few enough were her words at any time; but when she did speak, a tone of bitterness and sarcasm pervaded her whole con- versation, and her manner, always so cold and pas- sionless, lent an additional sternness to every word. Her mind was deeply stored with knowledge; and, by an habitual reserve shut in from any display to the world, perhaps the rich resources she had within herself were what made life bearable. She possessed no showy or flimsy accomplishments, but every day's employment was hard study-many hours devoted to writing, and one at least a day to the dryest read- ing. There were hours also of long, sad musing- of the past, of the present, of the future. Who would tell? Edith hoped this night, as her father did not return, that her mother might not be as silent as usual; that she would talk with her a little; but no sooner was the meal over than she received a com-  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7083-00000005"/> O       LIFE AND ALONE. mand to practise on the piano, and an hour of weari- some drumming followed. No word of encourage- ment made her task easier; but when finished she very gladly heard her mother's proposition to read aloud. The book chosen was Ossian-it was Mrs. Merton's favorite author; and while reading, her whole manner changed to more of brightness; her soul seemed struggling to lose itself in the beautiful imagery. Sorrow, self, were forgotten, except when some sublime passage of grief trembled in the voice, or she breathed a low sigh in unison. The reading was interrupted by a servant coming into the room to inform his mistress that a beggar boy was below, and wanted both food and lodging. "O, give him something to eat," exclaimed Edith; "but do not keep him all night; it would frighten me to death, and father away too! Do, mother, give him some money to buy lodging elsewhere." "You must get rid of these foolish fancies and fears," answered her mother. "What possible harm can a poor boy do you? He may have both food and lodging here; but first I wish to see him I And, turning to the servant, she ordered that 'the beggar should be shown up stairs. Edith urged a few moments longer, and then for her importunity was dismissed to bed. Passing through the door,   "FE AND ALONE.        1 face to face she met the object of her terror, and, im- pelled by curiosity, stopped and gazed. Never did rags cover one before who seemed so little fitted to wear them. There was an evident embarrassment, for the moment, in the boy's manner. His clear, olive complexion warmed with a deep red at sight of Edith. His keen black eye flashed its full light, and fascinated her to stand still and look. Then she distinctly heard him call her by name. That "Edith " was spoken with a voice whose very tone, -a thrilling sound,-once heard, so rich, so musical, could never be forgotten; and the rare beauty of his face mir. rored itself on the instant deep into her heart. Here, new, was food for reverie. How dissimilar were the boy's dress and manner! How'did he    know her name?  Why did he look so strangely at her? She went direct to her chamber, and taking the usual seat upon the floor beside the open closet door, she pon- dered over the above questions for a long time, and wove a  whole future's story just from hearing her own name uttered by a stranger youth. Sleep only wove these thoughts into a   more vivid reality by dream, until she was awakened by a strange noise, and sprang   out of bed to listen. She could not be mistaken in the sound. It was the voice of the beggar boy in conversation with her mother, and   &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7083-00000006"/> 2       LIFE AND ALONE.            ! they were in the room next her own. She could hardly catch her mother's words, but he seemed to be replying to some questions asked, and Edith quite distinctly heard him saying,-  . "The man was no niggard with his money; he gave me sufficient to defray all the expense of the journey; he seemed to command my going, and there was no alternative but my submission. re know an artist has a higher position in Italy than here; but that is all nonsense. Painting shall be a mere pas- time; to acquire wealth, my one motive for exile. I know that Edith may have- other suitors, and the wanderer's claim be as if it never existed." ITe paused a moment. Edith could not hear hero  mother's reply. Then their voices sank lower and lower, and she crept back to bed. There she lay, wide awake, revolving a purpose in her mind. She would wake up early in the morning, and see the beggar boy before he quitted the house. With an aching head she tried to sleep; but busy, excited thought took the form of questions, and kept her, mind disturbed and active with these queries:-- What was the nature of the wanderer's claim? What was his name? Whom had she known, or even heard mentioned, in the almost eternal silence of home life? Memory could recall no name of   "FE AND ALONE.       13 friends. Nay, even acquaintances she had none; nor her father and mother any, to her knowledge.  No guests were ever visitors at their house; nothing like conversation ever passed between her parents in her hearing. But to these questions thought could give no answer, and long before break of day she dressed herself with quiet speed and went out into the garden. She crouched down, back of some bushes on the cold, damp ground, near which the boy must pass as he went through the gate. Very patiently she waited for his appearing. The cold, gray mist of the morning fell heavy and damp upon her; but burning with curiosity, she heeded it not. Child as she was, she fancied the morning was drear in pity to the poor exile, and the birds had failed to herald in the day with their usual notes of glee. Presently there was the sound of approaching steps, and the tall and noble-looking figure of the boy appeared, show- ing by daylight how much less suitable seemed the rags he wore. Taking off his cap, he lifted dark masses of waving hair from his brow, flung back his head with some proud gesture of thought, and Edith gazed fully upon his face. There was no trace of boyhood there- more like the stern features of a care-worn man than the gleesome look youth should ever wear; and yet to perfect beauty was only   &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7083-00000007"/> "FE AND ALONE. wanting the radiance of a smile. The intense light of his eye seemed to have been kindled from the very depths of his soul. It was no sudden lighting up of countenance, but the steadfast, clear revelation of mind kept bright by active thought. There was that about his appearance which made Edith also at once give up all idea of discovering herself to him, and she only watched his every movement with suspended X breath, and listened to the last echo of his tread. Then she got up, and passionately exclaimed, -if j with a child's voice, a woman's feeling, - "This boy, once seen, to be forgotten? Never! A claim upon me-? It is well; he shall be the some- thing my heart has yearned after to love. What matter that he be nameless unto me? If I give him my thought and life, that's name enough. He shall be the spirit of my solitude; his face my ideal of s beauty, at which I may cast all the loose thoughts so long spent in aimless musing. Loneliness has lost its drear meaning to me; henceforth solitude will be rich with a heart companion. What matter nqw the wintered home where my sad or joyous mood finds little notice? Little care I now for any sympathy but his." And, in this excited state of feeling, with difficulty she refrained from calling the boy back, and offering to go with him, even to the ends of the   e LIFE AND ALONE.       15 earth. Only one thought arrested her - recollecting she must meet again in full the light of those deep, searching eyes, perhaps bent in more curious gaze upon her with all their unreadable expression; and she shrank from the' encounter. Better for her had she been detected by her mother that morning, and salutary punishment driven this first tangible folly from her brain ; but there it lay - a germ of evil amid a heap of rubbish, rich material with which to effect some lasting injury on her char- acter, a thought sprung up in an hour of idle cu- riosity to grow intensely, and now to become the very life-food of a mind hardly having passed the threshold of childhood. This thought shall banish by its very nature all the charming simplicity of her youth and age over her face, which thus early in life should be only a portrait of happy innocence. This idle thought will stamp a romance upon her charac- ter which ought to come years hence, when heart may meet heart, thought exchange thought, and two lives mingle into one. During the day Edith, with an inward smile, made many inquiries of her mother concerning the beggar boy; to all of which she re- ceived evasive answers, until her mother, as if wea- ried with her importunity, in no very gentle terms bade her drop the subject, and never refer to it again.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7083-00000008"/> 16       LIFE AND ALONE. "It were better thus," muttered Edith, "than any attempt to deceive me. I know there is a mystery about him." And a new feeling of respect sprang up in her heart that her mother should scorn a false story to be given in answer to her questions; though she felt deeply the sting her mother's words and manner always conveyed when addressing herself. I wonder if she can love me, I wonder if all mothers are like her, was ever the after-thought when she held any long intercourse with her, or rather at- tempted it. This time Mr. Merton's absence from his home continued for several weeks, and his wife thought that all memory of the beggar boy's visit had passed from Edith's mind. She saw her silent and sulky,- but not more so than usual, -and she did not follow her even in thought, when, at the allotted play hour between daylight and dark, Edith sought her own chamber, and sat down upon the floor beside the open closet door, and did wlat she called her pleasant thinking. She always had her doll in her lap, for fear some person should come in and wonder at her quiet. The subject of her reverie was now always the beggar boy, imagining scenes in which they both mingled, and sometimes breaking the silence of her chamber by fancied talk with him, in close imitation of the sound of his voice, and carry-   JLIFiJ AJ N AL VN,.    L1 ing out the deception-if overheard-by saying she was talking to her doll. All the little circum- stances of his coming, his stay over night, and the conversation she had overheard, took such hold upon her very vivid imagination that her mind never grew weary of the thought. Hour after hour, day after day, every moment she could steal away unobserved, crouched down on the floor, she fed her mind with the mystery. With double speed her daily lessons were learned, and the few light household duties enjoined upon her by her mother's strictness performed. All thought, all life, all energy were wasted upon reverie - sleep at night driven from her pillow as long as youth could effect it; but Mrs. Merton, enveloped in the veil of her own impenetrable grief, had no inti- mate knowledge of the little one by her- side, and, with self-imposed duty coldly performed, was con- scious of nothing wanting in maternal care. &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7083-00000009"/> 105 LIFE AND ALONE. CHAPTER    II. YOUNG Rothschild, or, as Edith called him, the beg- gar boy, pursued his solitary walk over a tract of country little calcultted to arrest his attention by any peculiar natural beauty, or variety of scenery. Nothing could be more drear and uninteresting than the road he travelled, over a barren hill, with here and there a solitary house to give life to the scene; but then his way turned into a more pleasant grove, out again into the open high road; and thus he went on for a couple of miles. Mr. Merton's residence, where he had passed the night, was situated just on the outskirts of the little village of Middleton; and if quiet be any recommendation to a place, Middleton reigned supreme. That its inhabitants were alive was best known to themselves, not to each other. Mr. Merton's house was the home of an English country gentleman of not superabundant means, as far as outward show went, nor did his grounds dis- play much taste; still there lacked not an air of corn-   fort about the place. The village was like all other small places, where there is no union of feeling or public spirit--pretty enough looking cottages, with their neat palings, more antique dwellings with nicely trimmed hedges of hawthorn, four dingy shops with groceries and calicoes displayed at the same counter, a stone church half covered on one side with moss, and- the prettiest feature of the place-a red-roofed school- house with open green in front. At the close of the day, men, as well as boys, might be seen amusing themselves with a game of cricket. As Rothschild tramped along his homeward way, he seemed looking for a certain landmark, and came to a rough wooden cross standing where two roads met. He turned into one of these paths, and penetrated every moment deeper into a thick grove. A light, curling smoke from a cottage hardly gave evidence of life, even in that retired spot; and a woman in the noontime of life was standing in the open door, her eyes far search- ing amid the tall trees, either her ear listening to the birds' matin song, or she standing there in expectant mood of something. Her appearance hardly merited the appellation of grandma, with which the boy ac- costed her, and added,- "You hardly expected a 'good morning' from me?"&#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7083-00000010"/> ZU       LIFE AND ALONE. i None the less welcome, my boy," was the an- swer; "but what has happened?" "O, nothing, only, as Mr. Merton was away, I staid all night at the house, instead of starting on my travels; and I have come back to breakfast with you once more. This disguise was just the thing. I don't  believe a servant knew me, and I sat up nearly all the night, talking." "Well, well, child; come into the house. Many lonesome meals I shall have when you are fairly gone; but it is best as it is." "Not at all best, grandma; and when I think of you alone here, it changes my whole purpose, and I feel willing to find employment in the village, to stay with you, and be content with just that." "Not so, my boy; you were born to better things ; and should you ever be recognized by your family, there must be no room for mortification. If unclaimed it be your fate to live, still your talents must have free scope. An education will be very necessary to make your own position in life. Mr. Merton is right, though it be only ill will to me which induces him to send you hence with his large promises." "The coach goes in about two hours," answered the boy thoughtfully; "keep the muffins hot, grand- ma, until I pull off these rags, and then I'll tell you something."   "FE AND ALONE.       21 In a few moments he came back perfectly metamor- phosed. Could Edith have seen him then, her romance might have deepened; but his grandmother only smiled as he took his place at the table, and asked,-- "What have you to tell, my son?  "That I have Mrs. Merton's promise that she will look out for you; and you know how quickly a few years will pass. Then I shall return, rich enough to buy all this land. Where the old cross now stands shall be the entrance to a splendid park; in place of this hut, a magnificent mansion; and then, you know, Edith is to be my bride. Is she not worth working and waiting for?" "Well, well, my boy; have fancies now; they are youth's portion; but let them slumber when you really commence lifers work, and give your undivided mind to study. You may be obliged to make the name your bride shall wear, and God alone knows what is in store for such as you. One watchword I give you, and let it sink into your heart forever: Truth I be true to yourself, true to your teacher, true to your God." "You seem to forget, grandma, that I have plenty of money, and letters to high-sounding names. The one I deliver to the old priest - he will have nothing to do but impart to me the rich stores of his hoarded   &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7083-00000011"/> 22       LIFE AND ALONE. knowledge; and the others will give me an entrance  into society where I shall see men and things as they  really are."                   X "I know nothing about it. I trust all will go well with you; but if so, you will be more favored than many of your kindred. It is ill enough with some of a them, I may tell you. You will see plenty of iniquity; ! but keep securely and secretly the little casket of  spun gold -on no account open or take it off your neck. I suppose Mrs. Merton enforced that upon  i you. You can hide the chain under your shirt collar,  and if fortune ever comes to you, it will be connected  with that trinket; and much sorrow also if time does  not banish some of the fancies flitting through your i brain. And it will be well for you to have your mind i prepared for prosperity, exile, or even shame."  "Not very cheering prophecies, grandma, with which to start. I think solitude has put foolish fancies into a your brain, and made you think everything evil; but I shall live in the world, and shall have no time for  fearful forebodings."       , "'Tis all the same, my boy; solitude teaches us  the sin in our own hearts; society, the evil in others'. I do not know what is best for you; the abb6 will decide." ' "He shall never decide me for the priesthood, Ki   "FE AND ALONE.        23 grandma, and I told Mrs. Merton so; but I must be starting; and once more, good by." "Virgin Mother, bless my boy! Holy saints pro- tect you 1 " She pressed him close to her heart an instant, and thus they parted. She knew it was forever; but one sorrow more or less made little difference to her. As days passed on, the boy journeyed rapidly towards Rome, his destined home, and she, his only known relative, left behind thus lonely, pursued her daily vocations with a shade more of sadness and a total forgetfulness of smiles. In the morning, with her own hands she performed the simple duties of her house- hold affairs, and varied the afternoon with manifold kinds of embroidery or lace-making, fruits of her foreign education. The evenings were all spent in reading or writing. Did she stagnate with such a -fate? O, no I the past had traced such a story for her, no future but death could obliterate the memory. Having reached Rome, Rothschild sought out the Abb6 D'Estrand, presented his letters, and immedi- ately put himself under the priest's guidance. With constant and hard application to books, he endeavored to redeem what he called lost time; but his reception precluded all ideas that his grandmothers forebodings &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7083-00000012"/> 24       LIFE AND ALONE. would prove true. His was a glorious project if its aim had been for the right end. Individual happiness is not worthy the concentrated effort of an immortal mind, endowed with powers too exalted to merge into  one earthly selfish wish. It is more in accordance with the true nobility of life to garner knowledge for the good of others, to send out sympathizing and cheering influences from the depths of a loving soul; and what we do for others secures the nearest ap- ' proach to happiness for ourselves. In the boy who had thus ventured to earn his own place, if necessary, and that an exalted one, in society, Nature had fur- nished the richest material with which art ever had to work. Genius lay slumbering in his bosom, ready to. awake at the first summons, and overcome every ob-  stacle. His was no common eye, about, for the first time, to cast its glance over the field of literature, but one to scan every page of a book, and look its con- tents back upon a volumed memory. From one idea received, the power was within him to send forth rich stores of created truth; and every line of poetry he read was but his own breathing effort to express thoughts which had slumbered in his mind for years. IIis inner life full of thought and beauty, it was easy to apply the torch of others' burning words, and clothe,  his own idea in fitting drapery.   "FE AND ALONE.       25 The Abb4 D'Estrand pronounced there could be no failure in the boy; then sighed as he remembered that the cold light of genius never afforded its possessor joy, the most glorious intellect never satisfied the heart, or could compare for happiness with that hum- bler heart wherein were placed household gods to love. Rothschild was proud of his tutor's approba- tion; but the cherished remembrance of Edith Merton was dearer to him than all his success in study, and he loved to dream over again and again the last inter- view with her mother. Mrs. Merton had then en- joined upon him never to lose sight of Edith's inter- ests. She had darkly hinted their fate must be united, and spoke of her own death as an event likely to take place at any moment, and with very little warning; and she had told him that entire friendlessness would be Edith's portion unless he remembered her. .Roth- schild had entreated her to speak plainer concerning Edith, - why she would not still be an object of care and solicitude to her father,--but from the vague replies received could only understand that when she became of age Mrs. lMerton wished a union to take place between himself and her child. From his ear- liest remembrance he had received proofs of the lady's favor; and hardly a day passed that he had not seen her at his grandmother's cottage, been taught by her,  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7083-00000013"/> 26       LIFE AND ALONE.  every boyish whim gratified from her purse; and always, during Mr. Merton's frequent absences from home, she had spent days and nights in their humble abode. In no way could he account for Mrs. Merton's deep and manifest affection for himself, or the strange inconsistency of her refusing to allow Edith to be his playmate. The wild wish sometimes crossed his mind to try and break away all the mystery in which his birth was enveloped; but then, he could never get hold of the slightest clew with which to commence investigation. Inquiries urged upon his grandmother were skilfully parried, and only by dint of persist- ence was the information given that she had no right to the title he gave her. At last he felt convinced that Mrs. Merton alone could enlighten him; but the fear- 1 ful state he had seen her once thrown into by his im- ! portunities prevented a repetition. When he asked  that Edith might be his companion, if only for an hour, 2 her reply was,-  "I 'will educate her for your love and care, and after I am gone, you may make return to Edith for what you call my kindness unto yourself."      With a romance natural to his character, perhaps increased by much he sought in vain to fathom, Roth- schild wove his own fancies as it regarded his birth and Edith included, and he gave her name to what was in   "FE AND ALONE.        27 truth his own ideal. Mrs. Merton had taught him painting, hoping he would prefer the art to the society of the village boys, and was not disappointed. He never tired of his easel, and she purchased of him every picture, and kept them as her valued treasures. Though the two so seldom go together, she found him no less inclined to music, and gave him lessons faith- fully; but her art could add little to the rich voice or the car with which Nature had endowed him. All this sweet intercourse was not to last. Cognizance, of the boy's existence came from a quarter little ex- pected, and effectual measures were taken to remove him to different guardianship. Mrs. fMerton bowed her head in silent, uncomplaining anguish. It was the last bitter drop in a cup already overflowing, the full bitterness of which quaffed was a gnawing secret in her own breast. She 'knew it fed upon her life-blood ; and now that mental agony was at its height, Nature could hold out but little longer, and her struggle was drawing to a close. She possessed a strength of intellect which enabled her to screen much suffering from observation, and tremblingly she clung to a hope beyond the grave, enough to live by, to exist merely her allotted time, but yielding little of the joy of a Christian's earnest, unclouded faith. A weight seemed to hang over all the performance of her daily duties  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7083-00000014"/> 28       LIFE AND ALONE. too heavy for her will to exert itself and remove. Perhaps there might have existed self-condemnation, and the conviction that deservedly she had become an object of intense hatred to her husband; for duty would have suggested to her to rise above any un- worthiness in him. The religion she professed would have enabled her to have laid that burden at the foot of the cross; but her story was all a mystery. Her charity was labor for the poor, not mere alms-giving. As a mother, the daily wants and comfort of her child were attentively considered, and no part of mental discipline was neglected. Her manner towards Edith might have been the result of her peculiar notions of female education. True, there was an entire want of the usual confidence existing in such relationship; but the child was peculiar, and the mother might not have dared to seek a sympathy which would have necessi- tated lifting the veil in some degree that shrouded the anguish Heaven had laid upon her to bear thus alone  and in silence. Mr. Merton was a man of very common capacity, firmly supported by self-pride; his position in society was good, as few knew the man intimately-none, I should say. He was honorable in his dealings, and yet screwing honor down to its narrowest admissible point. He was naturally of a suspicious temperament,   ijLij i -AI J AI LV1AYi D. ti and home afforded him plenty of opportunity for its exercise. There was a low cunning about him, in- creased by circumstances, but yet it could be traced in every day's business transactions. To read char- acter, penetrate motives, understand men, was a dar- ling study for him, and nothing was too little or mean to be made use of in that endeavor. This kind of effort to discover mystery where, perchance, none exists, often plunges the seeker into depths from which it is difficult to extricate one's self with perfect integrity. It certainly dwarfs the growth of higher nature, and creates misgivings in the breast, which, sooner or later, work themselves into the peace and happiness of such a person. These doubts destroy all confidence in his fellow-man, and clothe almost every qoble action in the hue of a devil's motive. A suspicious tempera7 ment is bad enough when there are health and pros- perity to carry on the struggle; but at the last hour of life, when the claims of a higher power are assert- ing their supremacy over the mind, that knowledge of human depravity a man has garnered by study and observation is apt to come home with double force, and preclude the hope of his own entire for- giveness in a Saviour's mercy. The good derived in effecting a purpose, formed from an intimate knowl- edge of mankind, in few cases, is more than balanced    &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7083-00000015"/> 5U       jlIFE ANU AND lA ,       j^W by the deep hurt seared on one's own heart. In no instance could Mr. Merton meet a man giving him credit for a simple-minded frankness, with no hidden sinister motive. The Abb6 D'Estrand, into whose guardianship Roth- schild was committed, was a man fully coming up to one's idea of a Jesuit priest; though, in fact, he be- longed to an order less strict in its requirements, and less deep in intrigue. At the time our story com- mences, he had just quitted the seclusion of his con- vent to assume priestly duty in the family of the Baron de Montville. There he lived in a style of elegance in strange contrast with his former obscurity, and had every means within his power to conduct young Rothschild's edu- cation as taste directed. A very warm attachment sprang up between master and pupil, while the con- fessional afforded the abb6 an intimate knowledge of the past and present of the boy. The only shade of bitterness which ever for a moment clouded the be- nignant countenance, always beaming deep love upon his pupil, was when the romance of the boy's charac- ter became known to him, and the name also of the person beloved. Then some fearful passions seemed aroused, and his anger nearly burst all bounds ; but his subtle mind soon suggested to itself that anger was   "FE AND ALONE.       3 no method to eradicate a folly, and he treated the sub- ject of love with keen satire and outspoken contempt. He admitted it might serve for a stepping-stone in ambition, when both genius and money were wanting, but added, - "The man who owed his aggrandizement to a woman's favor would reap a harvest of his folly in lasting repentance." The boy was silenced in bandying words on the subject with his tutor; but nevertheless, the name of Edith lay in his heart, a trust to be sacredly guarded by thought, a something to be gained in the future, ere manhood could acknowledge earthly happiness to be complete. The family in which he found himself domesticated and treated as a member, consisted of the Baron and Baroness De Montville, the young count, their son, and his wife, by each of whom the abb6 was looked upon with the greatest veneration and respect, and their temporal as well as spiritual interests seemed under his control. The mystery of his birth still remained as impenetrable as ever to him. The abbe forbade his mind even dwelling upon the subject under strictest penance, and directed him to amusements suited to his tastes and age, firmly trusting to time and his own influence to make the man realize the promise of the gifted boy. Rome  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7083-00000016"/> 32       LIFE AND ALONE. was a fair theatre for his work, the confessional a fair means to his end; and yet, how far from that famed city did the priest's influence, singly, too, as in secret, reach -controlling the life-story of more than one gifted boy, and perfectly cognizant of homes a thou- sand miles off? No one who gazed upon the closely- shaven head and marble features of the priest, with his brilliant eye ever bent downward, would have imagined his every thought was foreign to his posi- tion, his story the burden of many a simple heart, and his daily life an act of expiation. Little real hold on him had the religion he professed, and with his pupil he was wont often to throw aside entirely the priest and the master, showing himself only the brilliant com- panion and guide.   "FE AND ALONE.        33 CHAPTER     III. UPON the floor beside the open closet door, deeply engaged in one of her reveries, sat Edith Merton, when a servant, entering the room, informed her that her mother wished to see her immediately. Forget- ting to ask where her mother was to be found, Edith sought her in the parlor, in the family sitting-rooms in the dining-room, in all her usual resorts, and then, with some trepidation, went up stairs to her chamber door. No answer was returned to her timid knock, and she passed through that room into the one ad- joining, into which she had not been a dozen times during her whole life. The apartment was small, - little larger than a common dressing-room, --con- taining books, a writing-desk, and very few pieces of other furniture. No little articles strewed about gave indication of a pleasant withdrawal into this re- treat from family cares, or a book misplaced, that some hour had been beguiled with reading. Edith now stood there with an indefinable feeling of dread, 3  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7083-00000017"/> 84       LIFE AND ALONE. in no degree relieved by the cold tone in which she was told to be seated. "Many moments of silence passed, as if Mrs. Merton had forgotten her desire to speak with her -child, and she sat with contracted brow, as if with the most painful thought. At last, rousing herself, she exclaimed,-  "Edith, your father and I have concluded to send J you away to school. My health, so variable, will hardly admit giving the proper attention here at X home to your studies, and you will go to a Mrs. Ber- trand's seminary in Norland. The distance is so great, your vacations cannot be spent at home; but I  have made the most minute inquiries respecting the school, and feel confident you will be very happy I there. At least, it will depend upon yourself whether  you are or are not, and I have sent for you this even- ing to give you some hints how you shall conduct yourself when thrown for the first time among those of your own age. It is hardly necessary to enjoin industry upon you, and constant application to study, for I have no fears on that subject. The discipline of the school is such, that no idlers are allowed to remain. Respect to your teachers is also something you will be forced to observe, and certain punishment will be inflicted should you treat them with any impertinence. Habits of order, as well as industry, will be enjoined;   "FE AND ALONE,        35 but there is one very important matter, entirely over- looked in all large seminaries--I mean a want of care in preventing the contraction of intimate friend- ships among the school-girls; foolish fancies they form for each other, which later in life often prove most injurious. I have arranged with Mrs. Bertrand that you shall room alone, and have done all in my power to prevent your having any intercourse with the young ladies, except what is unavoidable in the different classes. I should prefer for you separate recitations, but that is not practicable, and I now lay the command upon you: avoid intimacy with any member of the school, - understand me perfectly, - under no circumstances be at all intimate with any of the girls, form no friendships or be in the slightest degree familiar in your necessary intercourse with the young ladies. Guard scrupulously a line of distance and reserve.") "Shall I be intimate with the teachers?" asked Edith, interrupting for the first time. "You will probably have no opportunity," an- swered her mother, sternly.  "It is true there may be young teachers, but it will hardly comport with the dignity of their position to seek your confidence or favor; however, the strict command that I give you is perfectly comprehended in what I have written  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7083-00000018"/> 86       LIFE AND ALONE. on a card and placed in a Bible which I shall give you. By this means it will meet your eye daily, and make forgetfulness impossible.' I might, if so dis- posed, show you the importance' of obeying my wish by telling you of fearful effects--the sole result of no attention being bestowed upon this most important subject in youth, the time which gives the whole col- oring to one's future; but the fate of an early friend of my own is so sad a confirmation of my words, I do not feel equal to the task of telling it, and simply command you to obey me." "Then you had an intimacy, mamma?" "Don't make me repeat, Edith. I do not intend giving you any passage of my own life-story. I'prefer you should obey this simple command, with nothing to strengthen its performance but the mere fact --it is your mother's wish. Let it be your first thought before entering upon your school duties in the morn- ing, and every night put the question to yourself after this form: Have I faithfully obeyed the very letter of my mother's command this day? If there are overtures of friendship made to you by your young companions, shun them; refuse them kindly, but most decidedly. If you manifest no weak hesita- tion in your manner, few will be bold enough to re- peat their advances; and at least into your Qwn   "FE AND ALONE.       37 chamber none will intrude. You can obey me, and yet never show your fellow-scholars any unwillingness to oblige, or any unkind feeling towards them. They will soon discover that your object at school is study, not play, and respect your efforts if you are only con- sistent. If you should fail to obey me at one time, and try to at another, you will be misunderstood by your companions, and they will despise your change- able moods, and your life in school will be rendered uncomfortable by your own failure in duty. Mrs. Bertrand will supply all yours necessary wants by the yearly amount of money your father will send her, and through her you will hear from home as often as is convenient, and she will send us monthly, or quarter- ly, tidings of your welfare, as the case may be." "When am I to go?" inquired Edith, sick at heart with the last item, that no letters would be sent her direct. "Early to-morrow morning, with your father ; and now, as I have some few things to attend to, you may go. Good night." With a courage she afterwards thought of and wondered at, Edith drew near and embraced her mother. She felt the caress was endured, not re- turned; and with eyes near swimming over with scalding tears, and a steady voice, almost breaking  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7083-00000019"/> 38       LIFE AND ALONE.        i her young heart in the effort to make it sound as usual, she said her good night, and retired to her own chamber. Hastily turning the key, she flung herself down upon the floor, and gave vent to a hearty burst of weeping; then, passionately wiping away her tears, she exclaimed, - "t What a fool I am I What am I crying for? Can any place be worse than home? But, then, if she had only kissed me I Perhaps it would have made' me feel worse. Now I shall have nothing to mourn for in leaving her, for I know that I am not loved. My room here? I shall feel sorry to go from this dear place; but how many girls have been obliged to leave their homes, and very dear friends besides! It won't be so hard for me, after all." A knock at the door interrupted her, and springing up she opened it. Withi an exclamation of glad surprise she pulled a young servant girl, who stood without, into her room, and locked the door again. "Why, Janet!" she exclaimed; "how soon you have got back. How far is it? and have you seen the house?" "Yes, miss ; been to the very door. It is about two miles from here; " and she then went on to give a minute description of the road leading to the beggar boy's home ; and ended with, "You cannot miss the   "FE AND ALONE.        39 way, Miss Edith; but, if you care to wait, in a half hour or so, Jim will be driving within a very short walk of the cottage, and you can meet him, on his re- turn, at the fork of the two roads, where the big red cross stands. Mrs. Merton is locked up in her room, and won't be out again to-night, 'tis no way likely, and this is your best chance." "' I know that," interrupted Edith, " for I am going away to school to-morrow." Janet's countenance fell, and the tears welled up to her eyes. "Don't feel bad about it, Janet. I thank you a thousand times for what you have done for me; and here is a little money for you." The tears streamed down the young servant maid's face as she stood and only gazed at Edith, repeating the words,- "Going away? What does it mean?" "I am going to school, Janet. There is not any- thing so strange in that; only I have just been told of it to-night, and I am to leave to-morrow morning." "That was so you should have no time to cry about it, miss,' sobbed out the girl. "Very likely," dryly answered Edith; "but here, take this money, and buy you something to remember me with; for it is the last present I shall make you  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7083-00000020"/> 40       LIFE AND ALONE. for a long time; and for fear I should never come back here, I thank you again and again for all your kindness and the many hard scoldings you have taken on my account. Now go ; watch when Jim is ready to start, and let me know." The girl mechanically took the money, hid herself in the hall for a few moments to give vent to very honest tears, and then muttered to herself, - "Well, this is the queerest of all-sending her off in such a hurry." She then hastened away to enter into the adventure of the evening with full zest, and see that her young mistress both left and reentered the house unperceived by Mrs. Merton. Pretty soon Edith, enveloped in a large shawl and hood of her trusty maid, was seated in a light wagon, and rapidly driven to the place designated by the red cross. Giving direction to Jim not to wait for her on his return more than five minutes, she sprang lightly from the wagon and entered the wood. There was not a particle of fear in Edithll's self-reliant heart, though the way she trod was dark and dreary. Her 'mind was fully made up to see the beggar boy, and this time talk with him. This night was her only chance, and the fact kept up her spirits. She knew that her walk back would be cheered by the light of the moon -perhaps by his presence--   "FE AND ALONE.        41 and if by neither, solitude and darkness were no draw- back to her young, bold spirit. Her mother would believe her to be safe in bed. it Pooh!" she said to herself, as she dismissed that thought i "mother will not think of me at all." Janet was wrong about there being but one path from the cross, and Edith, coming to a sudden stand- still, Was obliged to retrace her steps and go back to that landmark. There was a wooden step at its base, and she seated herself a few moments to look around. Now her undertaking seemed almost to assume a holy character from its nearness to this sacred symbol. Then she began to ponder what she should say if the beggar boy should not be at home, or how account for her visit, and finally determined to inquire the road back to her home, as if she had lost her way, - should he be absent,-and be governed by whom she saw, in her conversation. Of the beggar boy himself she intended to ask why he had come to their house, and what meant the remarks she had partially over- heard between him and her mother. She now struck into the other path, a little wider, and looking more travelled, than the first taken. The late friendly light shone no longer on her way; the wind sighed mourn- fully through the tall trees, and the fallen leaves, at sport with the ever-increasing breeze, sounded like  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7083-00000021"/> 42       LIFE AND ALONE. the footsteps of some creature behind her; but there shone in the distance ahead a bright light, and with renewed courage she hastened on. The light pro- ceeded from a cottage window. The curtain was drawn up, and Edith distinctly saw two women seated together in close converse. The form of the one could not be mistaken; to the other she gave scarcely a half look. Surprised, frightened to see her own mother there, she waited not an instant, but turned and fled. Jim had not driven her faster there than her two feet took her home again. Though wearied and spent, she did not feel the full weight of her ill luck until safe in her own room, with the door fast locked. She thought over her disappointment, and cried bitterly. As usual, she followed the old habit of reasoning with herself, and then concluded there was some consolation in having seen the home of the beggar boy. With this thought, sleep gently pressed her eyelids, and visions of an older, happier life haunted her wet pillow. The next morning she sat at the breakfast-table alone with her father. He good-naturedly pressed upon' her the forbidden coffee and hot rolls; but her young heart was too sad for eating. "Why, Edith, you have not eaten enough to last to the first stopping-place. We must take a hamper   "FE AND ALONE.        43 of lunch; but hurry up with your good byes; the carriage is at the door." To whom should she say good by? Her mother Was ill in bed; Jenny was indulging in a hearty fit of crying; the cook was cross ; the parlor girl and she did not agree; cats she detested. Her last fond gaze was bestowed upon the furniture, the familiar rooms, the lawn, the retreating trees, and her fare- well was spent. For one week she enjoyed all the, varieties of travel. Her father was uncommunica- tive; the newspapers and ale made him sleepy; the beauties of nature were not for him; and Edith was a thoughtful, serious, not a talkative child. One day, after a late dinner in a very nice hotel, which Edith wondered at because it was situated in a very small village, her father informed her that two hours' drive would bring them to Norland, and as he must return to the hotel that evening in order to take the cars early in the morning, he would drive over to school with her at once, the regular coach not leaving until eight in the evening. This, then, was the end of her journeying. She said nothing, but seated by his side in a light wagon, she would fain have waited, and gone all alone with her trunks by the stage; and her heart sank within her as she rapidly neared her future home. Yes, it would have been better to  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7083-00000022"/> ":        LIFE AND ALONE. have arrived later, and gone right to bed, where she could rest, think, and cry. She had formed no con- jectures of the place, nor when they reached it did she-as any other child would have done--look around, and endeavor to use the little daylight re- maining to form   some idea of its attractiveness. Ushered into a small room near the hall door, they there awaited Irs. Bertrand's appearance. Mr. Mer- ton remarked to the lady,-   - "I presume you received my letter, madam. Here  is my daughter." Without waiting for any reply, he took a very hasty v leave of Edith, bowed stiffly to the teacher, and was gone. Mrs. Bertrand had seen all varieties of hu-  X man nature, and did not show in her countenance the S slightest surprise. Edith was too weary to scan the i new face before her, and she sank down into a chair,  as her father closed the door after him, and, with her  eyes fixed upon the carpet, seemed to await with per- . feet indifference what should come next. Mrs. Ber- trand, noticing her fatigue, summoned an under teach- er to conduct her to her chamber. Dreamily Edith passed through the long halls, and found herself ush- ered into a  small, square room, with the barely neces- tary pieces of furniture put stiffly against the white- washed walls. The teacher set a  candle upon the   "FE AND ALONE.        45 table, then, thinking her duty done, passed out with no words of kindness or welcome to relieve any feel- ing of homesickness the little stranger might be sup- posed to have. "What a plain, sulky-looking child l" was that teacher's mental ejaculation; and when a group of girls gathered around her to ask of the new pupil, to her shame be it told, this first impression was de- livered. Edith gazed around the room, then, with a glad bound, sprang towards a door opening into it, and found, to her great delight, a small closet, with, besides the pegs for her few dresses to hang on, three shelves; and here was something which awoke pleasant recol- lections. Forgetful of fatigue, she sat down beside the open closet door, and gave expression to her thoughts in the low, murmuring tone she always used when talking to herself, or doing her thinking, as she termed it. "Here I may sit and dream as I was wont to do at home, my solitude made bearable, as of old, with bright fancies. By and by this spot will be as dear to me as its like at home. How I wish I could have brought my playthings, just to see them round on these shelves I But no matter. I am so fortunate to have this closet I'   &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7083-00000023"/> Her thin lips parted with a smile, and she whis- pered, "Edith!" for memory harped upon the dear sound, the name uttered 4y the beggar boy, in that insinuating tone, as she had passed him in the door-  way on that well-remembered evening. At morning prayers, among a group of happy-faced girls, some fifty in number, a lean, awkward figure crept slowly into the room, with both hands, in uncouth stiffness, i hanging down at her side, and with eyes bent upon   I the floor. The little person seemed in imminent dan-  i ger of falling headlong over one of the benches.   I Her dress was plain in the extreme as to material,  I and of an awkward style.   Her hair looked as if it had just- been hacked short in her neck, and was worn far off her face, as if a most useless encum- brance.  One could not see its hue or glossiness in the few ends which stuck out of her net. With head   I hanging so low down, her features were hardly visible;  but the name answering this description was Edith  Merton, the new  scholar. A half-suppressed titter came from some of the girls, falling quickly upon the child's sensitive ear. She had expected it, and, as f prepared, stopped suddenly in the middle of the   i 'oom, raised her head with slow dignity, and let her Wye rest for a moment upon every individual there. rue, the face thus turned on teachers and pupils was o              peculiar in its plainness; it was more so in the old, deep meaning of its sad expression. No look of happy, careless childhood was there, no feeling to be read thereon, with which the young have aught to do. A smile might have made much change in that early- matured face; but it was as impossible to imagine one as to escape the fascination of those weird-like, deep- sunken eyes, or read their language. The teacher motioned her to a seat; but Edith stood still with her wondering gaze fixed upon her. Then, in a peculiarly rich, mellow voice, which fell with a thrilling power of reproof on every ear, heightened by its exquisitely clear tone, she asked, - ( Ilad I not better go back to my chamber?" This unexpected remark, when the pupils usually awaited in solemn silence the morning exercise of prayer, created a momentary embarrassment even in Mrs. Bertrand, which was relieved by a tall, elegant- looking girl stepping forward, and, holding out her hand to Edith, requesting her to come and sit be, side her. "' No, I thank you," answered Edith. "It is being intimate." Every girl looked up in surprise; but Mrs. Bertrand in a moment seemed to understand, and assigned a seat to Edith near herself- at the same time exchanging a meaning glance with the young  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7083-00000024"/> 48       LIFE AND ALONE. lady who had so kindly proffered her services, and resumed her seat in perfect unconsciousness that she had received a rebuff. Edith had resumed her de- jected attitude, and during prayer-time never raised her eyes. It was the custom in the seminary for the young ladies to study in their own rooms, and to meet at stated hours in classes in the several apartments for recitation - the time being announced by the ring- ing of a bell. Although Mrs. Bertrand was the head of the establishment, there were male teachers for dif- ferent languages, and, indeed, one for almost every department. During the day, Edith was examined, classed, and lessons given her to prepare for the en- suing day. She was found far advanced in her studies, and a good position was assigned to her in the several classes. Dismissed to her own room again, she first mastered. her lessons, and then found there was one hour of study time remaining in which she had noth- ing to do. She concluded not to inform Mrs. Ber- trand of this extra leisure until the morrow, and so prepared to enjoy it in her own way. She bolted the one door leading from her room into the hall, and opened the one leading into the closet, then seated herself flat upon the floor beside it, and began her thinking. It was no reverie of home, or pining for its inmates, she indulged in; neither of school nor its   "FE AND ALONE;        49 novelties. She whispered the name "Edith," and thought wove its chart of the beggar boy's wander- ings, thrust him into innumerable difficulties, and in- geniously extricated him. After tea a bell sounded for the evening walk, - the time looked forward to with so much pleasure by every girl, -when each selects the one best loved, and has her, in school-girl phrase, all to herself. What whisperings, what confidences, in that twilight hour! Even old hearts can never forget their charm. Edith shrank back, pained, from every effort made to induce, her to join the romp or the more sedate. She mechanically walked alone, scarce glancing at those around her. The young lady who had offered her a seat in the morning at prayers drew near, and kindly asked, - "Are you homesick? Would you not be happier to walk and talk with us? Perhaps we should make you forget to feel sad." "O, no," replied Edith, soberly. "Home is not at all unlike school -the same lessons ; and I am very happy in my room. I never forgot anything in my life. Please don't ask me any more questions." With a puzzled look Clara Melville turned away; but imagining that Edith would attract less observa- tion than if left entirely alone, she walked in silence 4  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7083-00000025"/> 50       'LIFE AND ALONE. by her side during the hour of exercise, and her neigh- borhood protected her from anything like rudeness from gay, thoughtless girls. When Edith told Mrs. Bertrand that she -had one unoccupied hour during those allotted to study, she was given a new language -that of Italian--to learn. This brought her in close contact with a new master, whose name was Gonsalvo. Ills services had been but lately engaged for the school, but he promised to give better satis- faction than any before filling his department. If a highly polished exterior, quiet manner, and handsome face were any recommendations, he possessed them in an uncommon degree; and his credentials were of the highest order. If she could, Mrs. Bertrand would have dispensed with the former, and his age was a most unanswerable objection in her mind. Although she would hardly have allowed the suspicion that any young lady in her establishment would act out a romance, yet she looked with little favor on the ex- treme personal beauty of her Italian master. Per- fectly cognizant of the fascination of the language, its romances and poetry, hearing the unqualified ad- miration the pupils expressed for their new master, at times her heart misgave her. Then noting well his bearing and their increased progress, the latter decided her, and Gonsalvo felt sure of his post. It would   "FE AND ALONE.       51 appear as if no pupils could be so stupid but he could impart to them a portion of his own enthusiasm. His whole soul seemed in his work, and his patience never for a moment flagged. In Edith Merton he found dif- ferent material from all the others to work with. She possessed a retentive memory, and the rare order of mind which grasps easily the rudiments, and builds thereon its own fair appreciation of beauty and order. At the first sound of her voice in the repetition of some quotation he gave her in his native language, he started at the purity of her accent, and could hardly believe it was her first attempt. With difficulty he refrained from giving her more than a due share of his attention, such music was it to his ear, hearing his own language read in tones of unrivalled sweetness. Perhaps Edith's knowledge of Latin aided her to com- prehend, in part, the meaning of what she read, and thus give it greater effect. Already Gonsalvo imagined her through the rudiments, far ahead of the class, and alone with him, revelling in all the delights of Italian literature. Though her face bore no resem- blance to the daughters of his own land, and lacked all the beauty which might attract a man, yet, such was her wonderful progress in the study, he believed she must have attempted it before, and she became at once his marked and favorite scholar. One day, de-  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7083-00000026"/> 52-       LIFE AND ALONE. taining her after the recitation on some pretext or other, he inquired if she liked Italian better than all her studies. "O, no," she replied; "but the beggar boy lives now in Italy, and it is very necessary that I should study hard to speak it fluently with him." Before Gonsalvo could look his amazement at her answer, she had quitted the room. He must have mis- understood her English. Though most astonishing was the progress she made in all her studies, Italian took strongest hold on her imagination. Among the scholars her music was most remarked upon, her splendid voice in singing, her peculiar style of play- ing. No; the girl herself was most talked over- her habits, her love of solitude, her splendid talents, her peculiar looks, her sallow complexion, her un- gainly mode of dress. Edith made such strange re- marks, whenever she did speak, that the girls would have set her down as a half idiot, only her position in the different classes forbade that. Finally all came to about the same conclusion - that she was a genius, very odd and strange - all the young ladies, except Clara Melville, who looked somewhat deeper into char- acter.  Clara had been for years a pupil at Mrs. Ber- trand's- the one brilliant girl who had borne away every prize, gained the favor of all the teachers, not   "FE AND ALONE.       53 because she was of high birth, and her very name was sufficient to give much {clat to the school, but for her own individual merit. No pupil had ever stood on a par, with her, and yet she had escaped exciting envy. Her personal beauty was extreme, and the most indifferent could hardly look upon her face with- out acknowledging some magic charm. Her features were regular, but with an everchanging expression of light and thought, like marble endowed with life. Her manner, though tinged with reserve, had yet its own peculiarly fascinating grace, and won hearts with- out an effort. Her smile was sufficient to remove every appearance of haughtiness, and with both teach- ers and scholars she reigned, the favorite pupil, pre- eminent. In her sumptuous home she was hardly less of an idol than in this same school, and beauty of character shared with mental gifts this well-merited favor. For reasons perfectly incomprehensible to her- self, she felt strongly drawn towards the little awk- ward Edith Merton. Too haughty or reserved to force herself on her as a companion, yet she would never neglect an opportunity of showing her kindness or of saving her from ridicule. It is not to be supposed that Edith's strict adherence to her mother's command could save her either from some bantering or unkind remarks; but Clara's influence in the school being so  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7083-00000027"/> 54       LIFE AND ALONE. unbounded, her unobtrusive guardianship of Edith was most effective, as it was apparently unappreciated by the object. She never thought of pitying the lonely girl, because it was impossible to entertain the feel- ing towards one so gifted, yet peculiar. Such rare tal- ents as Edith's won the respect, but not the love, of Mrs. Bertrand, as had Clara's, in unison with so much engagedness; but, after all, the reason was--she did not understand her pupil, nor did the scholars their companion. How true it is in the family circle that the member least comprehended, often the most deserving, is the least loved I In every-day acquaintance, she, shrouded with any reserve, however high-toned her qualities, is the least cared-for. Unless manner very pleasing ac- companies great depth of character and worth, and an outgushing sociableness meets one at every step, the most absurd, erroneous, harsh judgment is passed upon an individual, and dooms her until some star- tling event brings her out, and causes a nine days' wonder, and the comment, "Why, I never knew she had so much in her." Poor, short-sighted humanity, caught by the glare and the tinsel, never penetrating the solitude of a being apart, even in thought, nor knowing some history must have placed one thus within herself!   "FE AND ALONE.        )55 CHAPTER    IV. IT wacs towards the close of the fourth term of Edith's school life. A public examination was to take place; and one rainy afternoon some ten or twenty of the girls had met together in the music hall, and sundry yawns and groans gave evidence how wearisomely the time hung upon their hands. "What an insufferable bore it is to be shut up in the house, girls!" exclaimed Emma Beresford. "You'd better add," said another, "T What an in- sufferable thing is idleness I And even our tongues, as well as hands, seem paralyzed this afternoon. I should think one of us might be spokesman to the rest, or else we take turns in being entertaining." "You seem to be making the attempt, Miss Ken- nedy; but do not ask how you succeed," remarked a third.        * "O, no, Agnes Walters ; knowingly I would never afford you the opportunity to make an ill-natured remark."  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7083-00000028"/> 56       LIFE AND ALONE. "She does not wait for opportunities; she could not make any other," chimed in another voice. "I propose," said Nellie Wheatoh, "two subjects for your choice, in such a dearth: viz., Gonsalvo or Edith Merton."      A "As for the first," replied a Miss Serle, in a most sarcastic tone, " you and your confidante might prefer to discuss him in private; and on one who pays us so little notice as Miss Merton, there would be a sad waste of breath." "It is rather squally in doors, as well as out," laughed a merry-hearted romp, nicknamed, by her companions, Kitty Clover--her true name, Kate Mellan. "Come, girls, don't stop; your entertain- ment is truly edifying and amiable. Laura, why don't you speak?" ":For the best reason in the world; I  haven't anything to say. But why not send and invite Edith Merton to come   down here and give us a song? We should all enjoy it, and I think it would be a great deal better than picking her to pieces." "I don't know about that, Miss Laura; but what do you suppose Clara Melville would say? Here she is: you can ask her." "Clara! Clara!"' screamed a dozen voices; " we are just on the point of quarrelling, and nothing but   "FE AND ALONE.       57 Edith Merton's last song will lull our disturbed pas- sions. Will it do to ask the favor of her?  "I see no harm in it, if you all wish it." "And ask politely, you mean to add," interrupted Miss Serle. "No, I never thought of that," replied Clara, with dignity; "your own good feelings would prompt po- liteness, not insult." "Well, Clover, it was your proposition; go to her room and present our compliments, with the request." "She won't let me in," said Kitty, demurely. "There is no need of her letting you in; you can speak-can't you?" v Had Clara Melville not been present, there would have been some sport about venturing even to the door of Edith's room; but a glance at her grave face decided Kitty to go without further remark. She presented herself, half timid and half laughing, at the chamber door; and her sudden rap aroused Edith from her usual posture, where she was just about to in- dulge in an hour's reverie. She opened her door, and showed neither surprise at the request or its manner of delivery, but silently followed Miss Kitty back to the music hall. Clara Melville politely stepped forward, opened the piano, and thanked her for so readily obliging them. For a moment Edith  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7083-00000029"/> 58       LIFE AND ALONE. bent awkwardly over the keys. Certainly her posi- tion was comical, and the young ladies resorted to their handkerchiefs. Not Clara Melville - she stood with folded arms, and faced the whole group. Then Edith raised her head and struck carelessly a few notes, apparently not in the mood for singing. Again and again she swept her hands over-the instrument, uttered a few shrill, discordant notes, and half rose. It seemed as if she would not yield to her own re- luctance, for, reseating herself, she hung her head in deep dejection, and played a few very soft, solemn notes, then burst forth into a song of the saddest melody. It was the whisper of her own heart finding full expression; while the tones of the instrument were so faintly heard, they seemed only the distant echo of her song. There was the plaint of her own loneliness. breathed forth in a few bitter words, then lost in a deep, resigned strain of melody, as if her spirit was wandering in dreamland, and improvised a delicious reverie. All could see she restrained, by violent effort, the louder, longer outpouring of a vol- umed song. In her haste, rising, she overthrew the music-stool, and, without waiting to replace it, left the hall. Clara Melville followed her. What a mine of deep feeling had such music disclosed in the awk- ward child threading the long gallery towards her   "FE AND ALONE.       59 chamber I Her very step fell upon Clara's ear with the power of mystery in its tread. She logged to lay that younger head upon her breast, and plead the offering of a sister's love, to break away the icy re- serve which barred all intercourse with that silent one. The effort should be made, and stepping quicker, she entered the room with Edith. "Why," she asked, " will you not tell me a way, dear Edith, to gain your love and confidence? No endeavor, on my part, shall be wanting to prove worthy." Edith's deep-sunken eye rested upon the beautiful face thus pleading its offering before her, then turned coldly away, and replied, - "No; 'tis being intimate." Not another word could Clara gain; and by her manner she saw plainly Edith wished to be left alone. Puzzled, disappointed, and yet charmed by the singu- lar child, she would not repeat her request, but left her with a few kind words. "Who do you think will carry off the examination prize, after this music we have just listened to?" asked Agnes Serle, as the last echo of Edith's re- treating footsteps died away. "Not Edith Merton,' answered several voices in unison. "It would be only an insult to offer a prize for such une'arthly music."  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7083-00000030"/> "I do verily believe," said Kitty Clover, solemnly, "Clara lollowed her from the room to see if she did not melt away into thin air." "Perhaps you have turned magician, Clover, and summoned by your art some spirit to- give us music, in a shape which has deceived us all in the form of Edith." "What nonsense I " returned Miss Serle. "I don't know  what art is necessary to summon that skeleton of an Edith Merton, or what deception is practised upon us, hearing her mumble a  dirge. I, for one, don't call it music."  "Why, you this moment said she would gain the prize, Miss Serle."  "I said no such thing.  I think her music is per- fectly horrid, and her voice sounds like a sizzling pancake."  "A   novel comparison for the divine art, and worthy the fine taste of the classical Miss Serle. Pray, did Dido fry pancakes for AEneas? This gathering of aristocratic young ladies might be called the Bicker- ing Club," said Kitty Clover, " for no one has made a remark but it has been picked to pieces. Now, somebody, say there is nothing of me to pick, as an aspiring effort of tired wit." "Well, Clover, who do you think will get the prize?"   J-A Y E  A t D  A L U A tC fB 1 'Clara Melville, without a doubt, and deserve it, too. That is, she will get it if she can beat me." "Ah, Clover, all the study in the world would not put an idea into your head." "Thank you. As there are three weeks yet before examination, and your remark is so encouraging, I think I will set about trying for the prize." A merry laugh followed, at the expense of the greatest dunce-in the school. Kate Mellan was a merry-hearted romp, whose whole life was fun. Her father, Lord Mellan, thought more of his parliament- ary duties than of a troublesome girl of fourteen, sole legacy of a, wifeh still less loved; and servants had had the management of the young girl, until, in turn, she managed them, and had been placed at Mrs. Bertrand's.  Now and then she would take a little advice from Clara Melville, being her room-mate; and, as their homes were situated near together, the good influence was kept up somewhat during vaca- tion. If Edith Merton could be said to have formed an opinion of either of her school-mates, it was one of unqualified dislike for Kate Mellan. She shunned her even more than she did the other scholars, and her manner, when forced, perchance, to exchange a few words, was cold and abrupt as possible. There was, likewise, little sympathy between Clara and her  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7083-00000031"/> 62       LIFE AND ALONE. room-mate; but, their families being intimate, her companionship was endured, as a matter of course. One morning Mrs. Bertrand entered Edith's chamber, holding an open letter in her hand. The edges of the paper were black, and a huge black seal hung dangling. She sat down and read to the child the sudden intelligence of her mother's death, and paused as if waiting to know how best to offer consolation. Edith turned towards her, fixed a long, earnest look upon her face, but spoke not a word, or let fall one tear; and thus the two sat fronting each other. Mrs. Bertrand saw deep enough emotion, but singular, for a child, in its kind,--only a death-like, increasing pallor spreading over her countenance,--and she was at a still greater loss what to say, for such a quiet display of deep feeling. At length, tenderly she remarked,- "I will remain with you this morning, my child." Then Edith started, as if an adder had stung her, and exclaimed, - "O, no.  I asked about the teachers, and death does not destroy the claims of duty. I thank you, but you will please leave me alone." Mrs. Bertrand saw how much in earnest she was, and accordingly left her. In the hall she met Clara Melville, directing her steps to Edith's room.   "FE AND ALONE.        63 "You had better not go there, Clara; you can do no good to the poor child, and if you will step into 'my room, we may as well now, as any time, have a little conversation about Edith." Clara did as she was desired, and Mrs. Bertrand, continued, --- "It does not seem just the thing for me to grant your request, and allow Edith to pass the coming va- cation at your father's; for I really do not think it would give you the pleasure you anticipate, or her either." "But, dear Mrs. Bertrand, will it not do Edith good? in some 'degree draw her out of herself, and make her more like pther people?" "She may give you great uneasiness, Clara, from this very singularity; though, I own, I think it hardly right for her to be so much alone, and with this new sorrow. Now, perhaps, new scenes might relieve her grief. Her mother's death makes me half inclined to grant your wish; but I will think longer about it, and give you permission to speak of it to her, all in due season, if I decide it best for her to go." "What injury should you fear to her?" asked Clara, anxiously. i"Injury, my dear, is not exactly the word I should use. I rather dread her leaving me, occasioned by  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7083-00000032"/> "       LIFE AND ALONE. an indefinable fear I feel for her welfare. Not but that you would be all that was attentive and kind, my dear Clara, but, as I read this child, she has very deep feeling, has been early taught to restrain and curb every emotion, and from this concealment of her true feeling has attained greater delicacy and refine- ment. Hence she is liable to be wounded when a less sensitive nature would see no cause. While your guest, any appearance of gloom or sorrow in her would- give you pain." Clara, however, continued to urge her request; and some of her arguments being unanswerable,-Mrs. Bertrand half promised, and then the subject was dropped for the present. Upon the floor, beside the open closet door, sat Edith, her hands crossed upon her breast, her head bowed low. "Life and alone!" she murmured, in a tone of heart-rending  anguish. "Yes; this is  life-- an  expression given to sorrow  by death. Sor- row! that has ever been   the unexpressed bur- den of my loneliness, the shadow  over my path- way.  The only voice with which I have ever had to do was a whisper from  the death kingdoms, to mock me with my loneliness. There is no mockery now, but a deep, eternal truth, comprehended in the single word-loss! O, life is very bitter; and it ngle wor loss I    r and i   "FE AND ALONE.        65 was to her. Will she care to hover near the bounds of her prison-house and watch over her child? Will not her way lie farther off from each drear scene, even in deep forgetfulness of earth and all its mem- ories? Why suppose, for an instant, that she will exchange the seraph's song for the burden of life's discord, or wish, even with sainted vision, to haunt my steps? O, mother I thou art borne upon the wings of the morning beyond the home of the winds, the cloud, and the rain. The glad smile .of freedom has haloed thy path, and, queen of some spirit-land, thou art dwelling in glory. If thou wilt not come back to earth, O, people my solitude with notes of thy harmony; sweep over the strings of your golden harp one chord of love for thy lone child; let her know that there is a note never silent in heaven for her. Mother I I'll hear it in the morning, and it shall lull me to sleep at night time. Mother dear, I have lived long on the memory of a voice which mur- mured Edith, and treasured it as the one joy of my youth; but now I claim a pity I never dreamed to beg. A life with the dead I urge as a recompense for faithfully obeying your command.  Ten thousand% winters could not freeze my heart, as I have frozen it at your request.

There is language enough in heaven, and to spare. O, give me a note of its joy to cherish here in my wretchedness. The winds sport there with angel voices; they are heavy and wasteful of rich sound. Of my mother's voice, too, they have more than they can bear. O that one single note could travel earthward, laden as their burden, unto mel" Next, Edith rose from her low posture, flung both hands wildly in the air, exclaiming again and again in her anguish,- "Life and alone ( Do I not know the full meaning. of that word, alone?" she continued. "Was it not first felt, then lisped, and now my very soul steeped in its gall? 'Tis a word with a mighty meaning. Few comprehend its full power.  O, I could tell them of its blighting strength, its blackness on the soul, its thraldom  over life, and the life-blood with which it washeth out the day's revealings." Such was, in part, the expression given to Edith's grief. It formed now  a part of every reverie; and then, with the strangeness of her nature, that reverie would be changed into quiet thoughts of the beggar boy, and her tears would in this way be quenched. A  week went by. Dressed in deep mourning, which gave another and more interesting character to her   "FE AND ALONE,        t whole appearance, Edith took her usual place in the class, and but for the outward change in dress, no one would have supposed she had had cause for sorrow. She shrank with increased aversion from Clara Mel- ville's proffered sympathy, and, when invited to pass the coming vacation at Melville Castle, replied,- "It makes no difference; wherever Mrs. Bertrand says." Kate Mellan, who had overheard the remark, ex- claimed, -- "Really, Clara, I do not think the number of your friends so limited, you need expose yourself to such an ungracious reception of kindness." "And I would give them all," answered Clara, quickly, "if I could secure for myself Edith's friend- ship." "You value them highly," retorted Kate, turning away in displeasure. "Go with her, Miss Melville," said Edith; "you may lose a friend, and in me you will never gain one; for I now see in a different light a command I once thought very hard to bear." "I make no reference to our being intimate," said Clara, cautiously; " but surely we may speak together. Tell me how you like Italian." "I could not," answered Edith, her whole face, as  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7083-00000034"/> 68       LIFE AND ALONE. it were, glowing. "It is the language of the beggar boy to me, and just what the voices of home are to you, I suppose." Clara, unwilling to show she did not understand her, carelessly continued, - "And Gonsalvo - how do you like him, as a teach- er?  "You are being intimate," said the child, and ab- ruptly left the room. The morning of the examination day broke clear and cloudless. Not so the daylight in the young hearts that greeted its approach. In some minds were the anxious forebodings of failure, the convictions of non- preparedness, and many useless tears were shed- for misspent time-too late their flowing now. From all parts of the country had assembled the parents and friends of. the pupils; and from the high repute of Mrs. Bertrand's seminary many strangers were there attracted. Teachers and pupils alike thought the con- flict of prize-gaining was between Clara Melville and Edith Merton. The self-possession of the former gained her the day. Clara was used to such scenes; Edith was not. Just before the final recitation, Edith was vainly waiting for an opening to pass a group of ladies and gentlemen, who stood conversing together during the short recess which intervened for every new class.   "FE AND ALONE.       69 Edith's little figure was lost under their towering forms, and she heard one lady say, - "What a lamentably plain child that little Merton girl is I It was painful to observe her during the reci- tation." Edith pushed forward to -the speaker, and gently touching her arm, asked, - "Madam, are only the -beautiful loved? at the same time fixing upon her the full power of her deep, but brilliant eye, in its most beseeching look. The lady was abashed, and found it impossible to frame an answer; and -another lady, coming to her relief, in- quired, - , "Why do you put the question, my child?  "Because," answered Edith, "I was thinking of the beggar boy." Here a summons for Miss Merton to take her place in the French class prevented further talk with her; and the child, as if her thoughts were indeed with the beggar boy, hesitated, stammered, answered entirely wrong, and lost the prize - unhappy result of an un- lady-like, ill-timed remark. When Edith sat down again beside her open closet door for reverie, the re- mark she had overheard came back to her mind, with the painful foreboding - the beggar boy might think her homely, and love her less. Her awkwardness,  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7083-00000035"/> T0  -     LIFE AND ALONE. she fancied, time would cure; but was her face so "lamentably plain it pained one to look at her"? The loss of the prize did 'not occasion her a moment of grief. "For what matters it" she said to herself, i" until the term comes, when the printed reports are sent abroad? Then, perchance, one might meet the eye of the beggar boy, and I should care for my position in the school; but now, who is there to be interested if I gain or lose a prize? ' In the evening a musical exhibition was to take place; and every young lady had performed her part, when it was discovered by the teacher that Edith had not been present at all. It was late, but the guests were requested to be reseated, and Mrs. Bertrand sent Clara Melville for the missing one. "But I have no piece prepared," pleaded Edith; "the choice was left to me, and I forgot all about it." "Play anything, dear, only come; because the com- pany are waiting for you, and I fear Mrs. Bertrand will be displeased." Into the brilliantly lighted hall, among the gayly- dressed people, entered the little shrinking figure, in her school black dress, without ornament or extra adornment, and walked straight to the piano. Her eyes were red with weeping, and her position at the   "FE AND. ALONE.       71 instrument awkward in the extreme. There was no sheet of music before her, and Clara trembled for her success, feeling anxious Edith should have one prize to replace the loss of that other, which, she could not help feeling convinced, ought to have been given to Edith, and her failure ascribed to the true cause- fright, not ignorance. Soon Edith, as if with sudden thought, changed her position to one of perfect grace, played a short prelude, then poured forth a song of the wildest, sweetest music. As suddenly her voice was hushed, and rapidly her fingers swept the keys, and gave a no less brilliant proof of skill. Again and again . her voice broke out in song- a rich melody, full of glee, and in strange contrast with her usual mood. The words of her song were of her own composition, and Clara Melville could compare it to nothing but the long, pent-up gladness of childhood bursting from the heart in wild disorder. She had done, and the eyes of the astonished guests were their only language of praise; and Mrs. Bertrand in silence put the prize for music into her hands. In the confusion of break- ing up, Edith sought out the lady who had made the remark concerning her appearance, and in a low, hum- ble voice, asked her if plain children did not some- times grow up to be beautiful.' The lady turned quickly, stared her full in the face, and exclaimed,-  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7083-00000036"/> 72       LIFE AND ALONE. "What a strange child I I don't know what to make of you." Edith glided away- with the painful thought added, - "Not only am I plain, but there must be a some- thing in my manner unlike all other girls, and very far from pleasing."   "FE AND ALONE.       73 CHAPTER V. "CLARAI CLARA!" shouted Kate Mellan, "your brother has just come. He is in the hall. Where are you? I have been hunting for you this hour." "He has just come, and you have been hunting for me an hour i" laughed Clara, as she hastened to the embrace of her brother. "But where is the little elf, sister mine?" asked Gerard. "I mean the one you intend to impose upon us the next six weeks, when I thought to have you all to myself." "O, Gerard, you shall not begin the very first mo- ment to speak in such a way of my friend. She is a splendid girl." "My sister, I beg a thousand pardons; but did you not write us she had refused to be called. your friend?" "I wrote home that she was singularly interesting, and not intimate with any one. But how soon do we go?"  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7083-00000037"/> 74       LIFE AND ALONE. "Right away," answered her brother. "I will give you ten minutes to get ready and hurry the - what shall I call her?" "You know her name, Gerard; now do try and like her." "Not until I have been regularly presented," said Gerard, " shall I be able even to remember her name. As to liking her, that is another question." At this moment Edith entered the room, and Clara formally went through the ceremony of introduction. Gerard Melville's critical eye took in at a glance her whole figure, even to the colored pantalets. He was too well bred to smile; but his sister's eleganty-dressed form struck him in queer contrast with the comical little person before him. Feeling the necessity of say- ing something, he remarked, - "You are not as tall, Miss Merton, as I fancied from my sister's letters." "O, no," said Edith, "I don't look as tall, because I wear pantalets. But why do you call me Miss Mer- ton?" "Because I have seen you only a few moments, and feel that I must treat my sister's friend with re- spect. " "I am not your sister's friend; but there is no   "FE AND ALONE.        75 reason why we may not be intimate. Call me Edith. And perhaps you know the beggar boy." "I have not the honor,' returned Gerard, laughing; and he found this to be the Edith Clara's letters had been so filled with; { but if we are to be intimate, why did you not give me the same greeting as Clara -a hug and a kiss?" Clara stood by, half displeased with his familiarity; but Edith saw nothing in it. She flung both arms around his neck, and giving him a hearty kiss, asked if Clara had done more. "Yes ; one more, and now we are Edith and Gerard forever," was his reply. Clara witnessed the little scene in mute astonish- ment. It was the first time she had ever seen an approach to an affectionate disposition in Edith, and her amaze was destined to be on the increase. In the carriage Gerard found himself amused, perplexed, and fascinated with the strange little being, who had in- sisted upon taking her place on the back seat, at his side. She was grave or gay as he might lead the conversation. She told him the story of the beggar boy, which to him was a perfect enigma, while Clara joined little in their talk, only now and then checking her brother for some too familiar remark, which she feared might give offence. It was all the same to  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7083-00000038"/> 76       LIFE AND ALONE. Edith; she heeded not his manner, but gave herself up to the rare delight of talking, imbuing even non- sense with a rare peculiar charm. There was an end- less variety in her topics, exciting a lively expectancy for what next she might say, and Gerard would not suffer her to be silent hardly a moment. The hours of the day's journey flew by on wings of wind, and it was nearing twilight when their carriage turned into an avenue thickly wooded on both sides with tall, waving trees, which formed an archway with their branches, and increased the darkness threefold,  even to the very entrance of Melville Castle's lodge. The iron gates were already wide open, and Gerard exclaimed, -- "Welcome to Melville and to home, Edith; " and by a short turn in the road, as he spoke, the brilliantly- lighted mansion burst suddenly on their view. ." And now; my new little sister, are you very tired?" Edith heard or heeded not the question. Her eye was strained upon the figure of a young man descend. ing the long flight of marble steps, and hurrying to- wards the carriage. Clara's eye was fixed in earnest gaze upon that form, and Edith heard her faintly whis- per the name Irving, as if the joyous tones of her voice kept guard over some secret. "O, do speak to him; I want to hear his voice,"   "FE AND ALONE.        7 exclaimed Edith, in uncontrollable emotion; but Ir- ving was lifting Clara from the carriage, and bending down he gazed into her eyes, to read all his heart craved there. In the joy of that .first moment of meeting, Clara had forgotten Edith; but on turning round, she found her weeping bitterly, and poor Gerard entirely at a loss what to say. Provoked at her own thoughtlessness, and remembering Edith's aversion to her sympathy, she hastened to present her to Irving without noticing her tears, when, at the sound of his voice, the strange girl flung back her head, and, turn- ing to Gerard, exclaimed, - "O, that is not the beggar boy's voice; but he does look like him." Gerard burst into a loud fit of laughter; his polite- ness could not stand the test of her comparison for the superb Irving, while that gentleman cast a glance full of haughty contempt on the child, and entered the house with Clara. Edith had noticed his scornful look, and now joined heartily in Gerard's mirth, with some expressions not very flattering to Irving, as they fol- lowed the others in. Gerard dared make no reply, for he saw the frown had gathered also on his sister's brow. With mock composure he drew Edith's arm within his own, and led the way to the drawing-room. Clara's warm greeting from her parents over, he pre-  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7083-00000039"/> s8       LIFE AND ALONE. sented Edith, and the affectionate, winning way of the child, as she embraced both Lord and Lady Melville, completely won their hearts. Several friends were present, all claiming Clara's notice; and Edith, plead- ing fatigue, retired to the rooms allotted her. Alone again, the family sat until a late hour in social chat, and their conversation turned upon Edith. Gerard took up the subject fervently, and spared no praise for the strange little elf, as he persisted in calling her. Clara spoke warmly of her talents and position in school. Irving with difficulty repressed an expression of contempt at Gerard's continued panegyric, and ab- ruptly bade good night. "What an absurdity," said Gerard, laughing, " for Irving to take such a dislike to a child during a mere introduction I Do follow him, Clara, with some sooth- ing words; he is more unbearable than ever." Without reply, Clara was gone. In an instant she has reached the library door, softly entered, and glided round to a table where a lamp was wont to burn deep into midnight. She found, as she had expected, the lonely student seated there. "This is kind in you, Clara," said he, " for I have sought in vain a moment to express my joy at your return; but that child seemed to engross all your at- tention."   "FE AND ALONE,      -   9 "She is a stranger, Irving, and you would not have me neglect her; butt I fear my thoughts were not at all with my attentions." "My greeting shall not take the form of chiding, dear Clara; " and fondly passing his arm around her waist, he drew her to a seat beside him. Again he poured into her ear his oft-told tale of love--words she never wearied of; but to him her words were few in reply, as if she fain would not lose the music of his voice for a moment. He could read in the ever- glowing light of her eye a response too deep for words to his every look and tone. And now a word of this young man. Lord Mel- ville, the intimate friend of, or, rather, dear as a brother to, Irving's father, had been chosen by that gentleman to be the guardian of his son; and at a very early age, before he could know any other parent, Lord Melville and his wife had received him into their family. Why or wherefore the child should be sepa- rated from his natural parents was known and kept an inviolable secret by Lord Melville. He gave the in- fant boy his own name, and treated him as his son. At first the marvellous beauty of-the little Italian won all hearts; but it was the early discovered genius in him which most riveted him to the heart of his adopted father. Gerard, a wild, reckless dunce, was far behind  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7083-00000040"/> 80       LIFE AND ALONE. Irving in all studies, and the father's attention was fixed upon the latter to realize all the fond hopes in which Gerard had disappointed him. It was a grati- fying moment to Lord Melville when this boy of his pride and love demanded permission to wed his only daughter, and become his son indeed, by closer bonds. One more year at school for Clara, and he had prom- ised his consent to their union. Lord Melville fan- cied that he thoroughly understood the character of his young ward, and blinded by the fascination of Irving's true genius, he ascribed every dark shade of passion to the excitability or peculiarity of that genius. He saw in him the future statesman, the marked man for his own party, and the one to take his place when old age and desire for rest should drive him from the field of politics. Had Gerard evinced the slightest taste for the business nearest the father's heart, he would gladly have directed in part his ambitious views towards him; but Gerard was too content to leave things of weightier matter to Irving, and follow the bent of his own idle inclina- tions. A student he never would become, and he only added his voice to the universal praise bestowed upon his adopted brother. Notwithstanding the-dif- ference of their habits, a warm .attachment subsisted between the youths; no envious feeling or assump-   "FE AND ALONE.        81 tion of superiority ever marred their intercourse; for if Gerard was proud of the beauty and splendid tal- ents of his Italian brother, Irving no less admired the elegant frank manners of the whole-souled young no- bleman, and the power to impart a portion of his own joyous spirit unto all with whom he came in contact. Lady Melville noted the friendship between the two youths, and was glad; but oftentimes an anxious fear would intrude into her heart at the thought of trust- ing Clara's happiness to Irving, his mood was so changeable, his passions, when excited, -so strong and wild; and she noticed a dark, malignant spirit some- times showing itself, which could only forebode misery. She indulged the secret hope that the year which must elapse before their marriage could take place might bring about some change. 'This self-delusive hope must have been dispelled whenever her eye rested upon the marvellous beauty of irving's face; and she remembered that the genius and intellect within far outshone the fair exterior. The fire of his brilliant eye would burn deep into the heart of every woman he deigned to love; his words, tinctured with the spirit of his genius, have a power to win, and his manner a devotion no woman could ever once receive and be willing to resign. His love bestowed would be no passing sentiment, to meet and lose a heart at ran- 6  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7083-00000041"/> 82       LIFE AND ALONE. dom; and fearful indeed the intensity of return that love could claim. And then, again, her husband had no shade of sympathy with these doubts. Alone in his strange genius Irving stood, far ahead of all com- petitors, influencing all around him by his talents, but never emerging from his isolated position, save before that one idol which his heart had elected. For her alone a smile, at rare intervals, would dispel the almost settled melancholy of his face. It was but a trembling sort of happiness to call forth that smile, and Clara Melville always felt an oppressive weight of a coming woe if love assumed a kind of gladness, and changed the deep light of passion in his eye to a glance of merriment, or wreathed those proud lips in laughter,--scarce parted but to breathe to her isome deep-toned, thrilling word of tenderness. It was this very silent mood of Irving which was to Lady Melville great cause for uneasiness. Lord Melville read it differently, and some brilliant effort and suc- cess in his service would raise him to the very pin- nacle of favor, and would satisfy as to any and every -mood apparent. And what to Clara were looks or mood? There was a life to her, all full of joy, to be where he had been, to mark the book which had borne the pressure of his hand, the flower on which perchance he had bestowed a glance on passing: all   "FE AND ALONE.        83 things, so insignificant to others, to her were full of love's revealings. Her very being was steeped in the mystery of life's one beauty-love. Her soul in that bright element threw the sweetest veil over his dark moods. And this was the girl who, -the mother thought, might change in one short year. If true, her fears might indeed assume a worse shape; for when change was wrought in such a love as Clara, only a blank, a wreck of beauty, would be left. Strange the mother did not discover that the essence of her daughter's life was love; that her very breath was heavy with its happiness, that her heart was closing itself to all other influences, save Irving's, for weal or woe. Edith had gazed in childish wonder at the beauty of her room - the books, the flowers, the statuary; even the furniture claimed her admiration from its rare ele- gance. What pleased her most was a harp. True, she could not play on it; but then she could sweep her hands over the strings, and call forth broken sounds, like answers to her own wild thoughts. Clara came in to bid good night again, and, seeing how she was em- ployed, proposed giving her lessons on the harp every morning, - as in all probability they would be left to themselves the early part of the day. Edith eagerly assented, and they parted for the night. Clara would  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7083-00000042"/> 83 :      LIFE- AND ALONE. gladly have shared the room with her; but Edith manifested the same disposition as at school, and, she forbore to name it. The music lessons were begun the next morning, and lasted for an hour; then the greater part of the forenoon was spent by Edith alone  in her room, practising or reading. She never volun- tarily sought Clara's company, but occasionally went to Lady Melville's dressing-room, sure of a warm re- ception. Unless in her mother's presence, she and Clara seldom met, until the dining-hour brought the whole family-together, and driving and company fin- ished the day. Edith shrank from strangers with painful- bashfulness, and Clara sometimes doubted if she enjoyed her visit. Irving never vouchsafed her the slightest notice; but every day Gerard became more and more interested. He was the chosen com- panion of her drives and walks; her conversation an inexhaustible source of pleasure to him. She treated him like a brother, and met all his attentions with a frank, fascinating confidence. More at her ease with Gerard than with the other members of the family, she seemed cheerful and happy; but it was with a hardly suppressed feeling of relief. Early as possible, every evening, she would say good night, and seek the retirement of her own room, joyfully lock herself -in, and with childhood's habit, never relinquished,   "MFE AND ALONE.       85 seat herself upon the floor, and pass whole hours in thinking. Quickly then she forgot the scenes in which so lately she had mingled. If her mood was sadder than usual, her loneliness was the theme for musing; but the memory of the beggar boy always came in to brighten thought, and-his whispered "Edith," heard as distinctly as on the night it was uttered, was the; charm to enliven her spirits. One morning, rising earlier than was her wont, she decided to go down into the hall, and practise on the grand piano there, before any of the family should make their appearance, and with less fear of being overheard. As she passed the library, the door of which stood open, she changed her purpose, and fancied to prefer an hour's quiet reading. She entered, and, spying a manuscript upon the table, carelessly took it up to examine the writing. It was in Italian. Some few sentences won her in- terest, and she read it all through. "It must be original," she thought, as she read aloud, unconscious how much pathos and beauty her voice lent the composition. "Whose can it be? Not Gerard's I for I have only succeeded in getting mio caro through his dull brain; not Clara's, for she would not have left it here. No one but Irving could have written it." She heard a half-drawn sigh, and, looking up, there  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7083-00000043"/> 86    -    LIFE AND ALONE. he stood before her. Not in the slightest discom-  posed, she put the paper down, saying, - "An attempt at Dante, and a most complete fail. ure. I suppose it is yours; sounds like you." "It is," coldly replied Irving. "Your thoughts, Mr. Melville, as penned here, seem to have been wandering to the dark land from whence light and love are excluded; and words and imagery are here put down, which might have adorned a more noble theme ; at least, conveyed a better moral lesson."  "I had almost fancied," said Irving, in his lowest, sweetest tone, " that my poor effort was of some worth, as I listened to the justice you did it in reading." Edith looked up in astonishment at the change of his manner towards her, met the full glance of his eye beaming only admiration upon her, and exclaimed in- voluntarily, - "Yes, you are superbly handsome." Then, chan- ging her tone, she went on: "But yours is a beauty, after all, of rare expression. The man is elegant; but this composition would give one the true idea of your face, almost always." "What does my face usually express?" asked Irving, smiling. "What! a smile from you? 1" said Edith. "Dark and gloomy thoughts are your wonted expression."   XlIt'F  A NIN  ALIWN Z- ix a. "My fate is dark and gloomy," answered Irving, Idly; "my life's purpose a bubble, which may urst any hour; my very parentage unknown. I ve in constant fear of what the morrow may dis- lose." "The seeds of your own destiny, Mr. Melville," nswered Edith, somewhat touched, " may be planted y your own hand, nourished by your own efforts, ear fruit a thousand fold for time, and a harvest for "eternity." "Very true, Miss Edith, in words; but the result nay be spurned, as you have spurned this little trial." I thought nothing of it," said Edith, rising to uit the room, " because it was of forced growth- ieither one thing or another; choose a purer element or thought, and a more Christian manliness to por-- ;ray." He made no effort to detain her, but sat musing. The night before he had read his composition to Clara, and received her most unqualified praise. Not an evening passed at the Castle, that Clara's music was not one of the entertainments of the hour; but, Edith had never once been asked to play or sing. Why was she overlooked?  Clara Melville had often tried to make the effort, and conquer a feeling she knew to be degrading, and give to her  e.

When her mind was made up to proffer the request, her eye involuntarily turned upon Irving, and she failed. Of late she had noticed how the first coldness of his manner to Edith was wearing off; how much sympa- thy there was in their opinions on many subjects; and in the expression of any new and brilliant thought, how Irving would turn to Edith to read its purity in the sunken eye of the- child. Edith's con- versational powers were wonderful; no less so were Irving's, and he seemed to possess a charm to draw hers out to their fullest extent. If she were sporting with Gerard, then he gave all his attention to Clara; but, if sitting apart by herself, he would approach, and with winning manner and gentle words lure her 'to converse with him, sometimes in English, oftener in Italian. Edith did not enjoy these moments, but was compelled to answer him by a power she could neither understand nor resist.- It was when one of these side talks had lasted longer than usual, that Clara, unable to restrain herself, drew near. Edith looked up, and fixed upon her a glance so unmistaka- ble, that her resolve was taken in an instant; and, giving back look for look, she exclaimed, - "Edith, will you take my place at the piano to- night?"   "FE ANfD ALONE.   '    89 Was the look pity with which Edith assented? Clara could not tell; but from that moment she dated feelings of bitter hatred towards her guest. Could she have betrayed-herself? For Edith's song was improvised, and a true expression of the change in her own heart.  When the words, "Love has ceased to trust me," in most agonizing tone, were poured out, all harmony was hushed, and only a spirit wail listened to. 'All were affected unpleasantly by the song-. Gerard gave a sigh of relief when it was concluded, and no one spoke a word of praise. Ir- ving's face looked black as midnight. Clara trembled with the full consciousness that she was harboring unworthy thoughts--jealousy and envy--in her breast; and the awful truth struck home with force -the beauty of her inner life was marred, indeed; while Edith, apparently unconscious of the effect of her singing, bowed smilingly, and quitted the room. "Poor child!" said Lady Melville ; " she is young to sing such words with so much depth of feeling; her mind is too old for her years." ( Clara, dear," remarked Lord Melville, "I do not remember such a song among your collection: have you it? Whose are the words?" "Edith improvised them, papa, for the occasion." "And will forget them to-morrow," said Lord Mel-  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7083-00000045"/> UU       LIFEi AN 1 ALVIN JD. ville; "and 'tis well she should. That is one of the blessed prerogatives of these geniuses. Their agony is all spent with harmless power, and hilarity returns after the most desolating tirades. This Edith Mer. ton, Irving, is like a flower of your own land; and I should not be surprised if time should develop much beauty of face in her." "Yes," answered Irving, thoughtfully; "she has probably had no childhood, and it will come at the time when another woman would begin to fade. Her youth will be eternal, in life and mind." A -pang shot through Clara's heart, but her glance met Gerard's with a smile at Irving's praise of Edith.   "FtJE AIN1v AJUJ. 'U CHAPTER VI. IT was the celebration of Clara Melville's birth- night. Carriage after carriage rolled up to the castle door, bringing guests without number to fill the brilliantly illumined rooms. The night was dark and lowering; but the in-door gayety gave little heed to the thickening clouds without. While nobility and beauty shone preeminent, Clara Melville was outdone by none. Many thought the character of her face changed since she was last at home, and had a former birthnight party given. A joyous, careless look was gone, and in its stead a more sedate, a sterner beauty reigned. Queen of the hour, she seemed to tread with a prouder step than had ever before marked her haughtiest mood. In her reception of every arrival the lips were parted for a smile; but from the cold light of her eye shone forth no welcome, and her few words were of simple, polite greeting. Irving stood by her side. Had they changed characters? A sun- beam of an inner joy diffused itself over his features;  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7083-00000046"/> 92       LIFE AND ALONE. his eye was brilliant with its flashing light, and his manner forced every new comer to linger a moment near him, -a tribute to its fascination,-while his words were an impressive greeting, the very heart- echo of kind wishes, at least for the passing hour. Gerard, handsome, frank, and winning, as always, had just renewed an acquaintance with our old friqgd, none other than Kate Mellan, the respected" ( Clover " of Mrs. Bertrand's school. Poor girl it was easy for any looker-on to see that she was giving more weight to the pleasantries of the young nobleman, and to his assurances of delight at their meeting, than he intended to convey. Her blushes and half- timid reply fed well his vanity, and it was easy to continue a strain costing no effort to SQ patient a lis- tener.  Gerard's capacity for talk being restrained within the limits of fun, and his companion seldom transgressing the bounds, mutually they interested each other. "There's Lady Blanche, there's Lady Blanche," was whispered through the room; and- every eye turned towards the door, as a lady of most surpass- ing grace and beauty entered. She might have been in the meridian of life, but her face told no tale of her age.  Her dress was without jewel or flower- some simple white material floating around her, she   "FE AND ALONE.       93 looked a Peri within a cloud of gossamer. She leaned slightly on the arm of a heavy, inane-looking old man, whose' face seemed to have worn a long-indulged fit of ill humor. His companion's face, in strange contrast, had a look as of childhood left, so bright and pleasing; and her manner, the very promptings of a warm heart, so unstudied and natural. Nothing spoke the woman but the grace of a slight and gentle dignity, as if her married state had made that incum- bent upon her. Approaching Clara, she withdrew her arm from her husband, and taking her hand with Irving's, placed her own upon them, sjmiled her good evening, giving to each an arch, intelligent look, and quickly mingled with the crowd. Her eye first fell upon the animated face of Kate Mellan, her niece, talking with Gerard, and, with an amused look, she watched them for a few moments, and then drew near, exclaiming, - "Kate, where is your young schoolmate? She must be a stranger here, and ought either to be with  you or Clara. Point her out to me." "I do niot see her, auntie, and she would not care for attention from either of us." "What! Is she so independent as not to feel strange amid strangers?" continued Lady Blanche. "Gerard, I must insist upon your leaving this young lady, and finding your sister's visitor for me."  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7083-00000047"/> "       LIFE AND' ALONE. "That the Lady Blanche should ever lay a com- mand upon me impossible to obeyl The quadrille has formed, only waiting for Miss Mellan, ad she awaits myself - her partner." "Go, then; I will try my own skill, for it is no difficult matter to tell a school-girl, anywhere. No disparagement to you, Katy; hasten to your dance." The Lady Blanche was thwarted in her purpose; for a crowd of admirers soon hemmed her in. She was not unmindful, however, and narrowly scanned every group which passed her, if any one might an- swer the description her niece had given her of Edith. She suddenly became lost in thought, and gave absent answers to the flatterers which surrounded her; but any word'from the Lady Blanche was considered fas- cinating, and whether silent or talkative, she held her usual court. Late, very late indeed, there glided through the crowd a small, airy figure, dressed in black crape.  The length of the dress gave that figure its natural height, without any of the awkward- ness formerly ascribed to it. The hair was of braid- ing length, and wound round her head, and its heavy richness contrasted finely with the marble whiteness of her complexion. The face had no pretension to beauty. It was only uncommon, and once seen could never be forgotten. And yet had this person,   "FE AND ALONE.       95 in whom the reader must have recognized Edith Mer- ton, never approached so near being beautiful as on this night; while in perfect keeping was her thin black dress to the passing shadows resting lightly, and yet visibly, on her youthful brow. Color would have changed her into a beauty; but the reigning harmony only stamped her face as interesting. Advancing towards Clara, she exclaimed, as if in apology, - "I was thinking, and the hours slipped by un- heeded. Is it too late to wish you much pleasure this evening? ' That peculiar voice - every tone told of grief, of solitude; and it was more like the murmur of the wind, heavy with sighs, breathed into words, than the voice of girlhood. That tone, that simple ques- tion asked, fell on the ear of Lady Blanche. With a sudden start she quitted her circle of admirers, and hastened towards Clara. Her face showed plainly emotion; and, just on the point of speaking, some one roughly touched her arm. She turned round; her husband was at her side, and said, in a low voice, - "It is useless to seek an introduction with the child; the carriage waits, and I choose to return home immediately." "And   I choose to remain an hour longer, my  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7083-00000048"/> 96       LIFE AND ALONE. 1prd ; perhaps two," said Lady Blanche, in her sweet- est tone; "but pray go home, and fear not for my admirers; I am about to suit myself to a child's com- pany;" and, smiling sweetly, she again turned to- wards Clara. My lord, with a half-smothered oath, remained. t"Yes, stay, 'old fellow; quell your passion for another hour, only to wreak vengeance on your victim, later, at your own hearthstone," were the words al- most hissed into his ear. "Who spoke to me?" said he, turning quickly round. "No, sir; I did not," answered Irving; but the expression of his face fully denied the assertion; while the angered old man, unconscious, mingled with the crowd, hoping to recognize that soft, hissing voice again. "Clara, won't you present me, properly, to your young friend?" asked Lady Blanche, " though I am very sure I know her already; " and she smiled kindly upon Edith. "Edith, this is the Lady Blanche Glenville, of whom you have heard Gerard speak so often, Kate Mellan's aunt; and, Lady Blanche, Miss AMerton." While Clara quickly moved aside, Edith slightly bent towards the lady, in acknowledgment of their   "FE AND ALONE.        9T introduction. An awkward pause ensued, -and for once Lady Blanche was at a loss what to say. The uncommon self-possession and dignity of the child so surprised her, she hardly dared venture on nonsense. Perhaps she feared those deep-sunken eyes would glance full reproach on her, let her say what she would; and, at length, half timidly, she asked,- "Shall we draw near the harp, and listen to the music?" "I do not call that music; the sound here is painful to me," answered Edith, coldly. "You play yourself, then, and much better, per- haps." "I play," answered Edith, " but my music is not liked, and I am never asked to play a second time. But look; Clara seats herself at the harp : her song will be in Italian, and I always listen to that." "Do you like Italian music better than any other?" asked Lady Blanche. { I like it," replied Edith, " because it is the lan- guage of the beggar boy. But what is the matter with Clara's voice to-night? How unusual it sounds! ' "I observe no change, Miss Merton; I never par- ticularly admired her singing. But tell me how you like school life?" "All places are alike to me." z  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7083-00000049"/> 98       LIFE AND ALONE. "Have you formed no pleasant intimacies there- Clara, for instance? She is very lovely, and a friend wort, having." "I only study at school, ma'am." "But in hours of recreation, I mean, when you girls are all together." "I do not understand you, ma'am, and would like to listen to Clara." The child's manner was perfectly polite, so no of- fence could be taken; and Irving joining his voice in the song, Lady Blanche was content to listen. After it was ended, she made a second effort to engage Edith in conversation by asking how she liked Ir- ving's singing. "It is very like himself," was the reply.. "What, then, do you think of him?  I never think of him, at all." "Now you will sing for me, I know." "O, no; excuse me, Lady Blanche; " and for fear of being urged, the little black figure glided like a phantom from the room. "She is indeed like her mother," thought Lady Blanche, as Edith disappeared, "and yet unlike." Then, as if overcome by some sudden emotion, Lady Glenville watched her opportunity, and, unob- served, escaped from the room. She hastened to her   "FE AND ALONE.       99 carriage, and alone there wept unrestrainedly. The object for the evening was accomplished, and the home scene to which she was returning was of too frequent occurrence for her to care much, or to shed such bit- ter tears about.

To one of her vivid imagination the scene was fairy-like. The clouds had all dispersed, and the lamps of heaven were bright again. The gentle breeze stirring, freight- ed with the perfume of flowers, seemed to lift the weight off her brow. "Yes; Nature is kinder to me than aught else," she thought; "for her breezes have balm in their whispers, and her silent language a communion with my spirit, pure and true. I am happier here than Clara within;" and she seated herself on one of the garden seats, in the very luxury of content.  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7083-00000050"/> 100       LIFE AND ALONE. "Edith here, and alone?" uttered a low, deep voice near her. She raised her eyes, and beheld Irving opposite, leaning against a tree. "Yes, Mr. Melville; life and alone is no such bit- ter fate, especially with Nature, that you need always speak to me so pitifully." "You have mistaken the tones of my voice, if you thought I meant pity for such as you. Listen now; my story shall be short, but must encroach upon your solitude because it is meant for your ear alone. May I tell it?" "Life and alone, Mr. Melville, is my fate. I feel little sympathy in anything you may have to commu- nicate; but if you choose to occupy a few moments of such a waste, why should I care?" "I would your permission had been given more graciously; but I cannot let this opportunity pass to speak with you alone. More than a month ago, a few rods from this very spot, I saw you first, heard your first words about some fancied resemblance I bore a beggar boy. I scorned the title then; I wear it now. You have beggared me of peace, of hope, of joy. You have stolen into the deepest recesses of my very being, and borne hence with you all wherewith I had to live. .The treasures of my mind, with which I   "FE AND ALONE.        101 hoped to create life's mockery of joy, you have plun- dered, and left me but a beggar. You have entered my heart's most secret chamber, and become the idol there. This soul, formed for Heaven's worship, as you say, is a beggar at your shrine, asking, nay, humbly entreating, the alms you, of all the world, can give. Say, Edith, do you not recognize the beggar you have so often named suing at the threshold of your own heart?" "I am a listener, Mr. Melville." "Ten thousand thanks for even that, dear Edith; but more I crave. O, restore to me the desire for life, the boon which you alone can grant. Be the one my being craves to live, to love, to die with. My mind with yours, in commingled light, shall gain a lustre bright as lasting. Edith, thou art that other thought my mind began life's journey in search of; and dear to me must be the found, so ardently desired, so long sought. A voice has wandered through the archives of my inner life claiming its echo; you spoke, and it was heard. How long a time I fought off the recog- nition of this truth, my first assumed coldness, and disregard of you, apparently, bear witness. I have unravelled every thought of mine, and find in their every fibre a craving for your love. Say, Edith, will you grant this beggared heart the dear possession  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7083-00000051"/> 102      LIFE AND ALONE. of your love--the richest treasure the universe can offer?" "Listen now to me, Mr. Melville, for my story may have a bearing upon yours. In the disguise of a beg- gar, a boy came to my own home, and my name was upon his lips. When I first saw you, I noticed so strong a resemblance I fancied it was he. You spoke; I perceived at once my mistake/ Until this hour I imagined dislike was the only feeling with which I regarded you. Judge, if you are able, if you retain one spark of honor, of the surprise with which I have heard you. Let me tell you, my only feeling now is contempt. Dislike has merged into a sort of loathing, whose mildest term is contempt. I tremble lest I may be tempted to act the part of friendship, and warn Clara Melville of your baseness. Htad my mother not commanded otherwise as her last injunction, I would do so. Rest assured, no feeling for you keeps me silent." She ceased speaking, and was gone. Clara Melville had stolen out into the night air. Tired of her guests, she had sought a moment's respite, and heard- enough. She went back into the house. The night came on apace; group after group had bade adieu to the stately beauty, who now, instead of looking wea- ried, urged their longer stay. There was a flush of   "FE AND ALONE.       103 richer glow upon her cheek, a brighter eye, and more smiling grace of parting than there had been of greet- ing. The last carriage had rolled away. Clara bade her admiring parents good night, smiled at Gerard's compliments, and left the drawing-room. She hastened to the library where she was wont to meet Irving, and exchange some dear and last words before seeking her chamber. She found him seated there as if in a tired mood, with head leaning upon his hand. She stepped towards him, bent low, and pressed a kiss upon his brow, murmured, "My brother I " and hastened from the room. Only a few moments did Clara Melville re- tain her maid that night. She ordered the fire replen- ished, her hair to be unbound, brushed, and that was all for the girl to do. Once more alone, the young mistress stood in the centre of her apartment, and laughed a low, wild laugh; and then, for fear of madness, she pressed both hands upon her brow, and exclaimed, - "O, let me weep I " The hot, scalding tears which flowed were scarcely a relief. An hour went by. "O, this is folly--folly in the extreme; these tears shall be the last evidence of my weakness. Henceforth, life and alone I What!

Mine is a common story; 'tis a common fate--a weakness which excites no sympathy. Let it be hid- den even from my own consciousness. Surely I can acquire a strength which shall crush every feeling, deaden all of woman, and leave me cold and passion- less as I could wish. Let my power to love sleep eternally, and no coming hour prove me unequal to the struggle. Hush, hush, my heart, your beating, for fear one throb may be for him. Let me make some amends for a life-long wasted affection, for its degradation. Irving, I would not condemn you; merely give utterance to my soul's farewell; look upon your beauty, and know that it makes no impress on my heart; meet the glance of your eye, and feel that it does not burn into my soul; listen to your voice, and imagine no summons back to joy; know of the higher flights your genius will take, follow and mount upward too in the clear cold of a wintered freedom. But can I give him up? What I resign my life of life! Yes, yes; 'tis said! O, agony, 'tis done I Henceforth and forever I tear the past from memory's keeping into atoms. My God, my God I the struggle is over. Why remaineth this sense of wretchedness? O, where is peace? I ask not for joy, but for calm, for rest."   "FE AND ALONE.       105 She flung herself upon her knees, and uttered the prayer,- "Heavenly Father, I have wandered from thy love, and chosen an earthly, which has failed, me. O, in thy infinite mercy, raise me unto thyself; give me strength to be wholly thine. Pardon my long neglect of thee; pardon all my sins. Save me from a return; save me from myself.' I desire to be thine - wholly thine; and thou wilt forgive because Christ has prom- ised, and in his name I ask." The morning light found her still kneeling; but as its gray dawn increased, she rose, and with restored calmness began to disrobe herself of ornament and dress. There was a look of wretchedness, when all was done; but without sign of emotion she lay down for rest.- Short and fitful was her slumber; and ere the day was far advanced, she rose and dressed. On entering the breakfast-room Irving was at the door, and her kind good morning was uttered with a smile. Edith was found, and her lesson on the harp given with more attention- and kindness, if possible, than ever. After dinner Gerard proposed a horseback ride. Clara won the race with Irving, Edith with Gerard. In the evening all attended a small party at Kate Mellan's. The hours were a heavy drag to Clara, yet she bore her part bravely; nor, returned to the soli-  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7083-00000053"/> 106       LIFE AND ALONE, tude of her own chamber, did she give vent to a single regret. The evening prayer was uttered with the sim- plicity of a child; the high-born, haughty heiress seemed to have suddenly changed into a humble seeker after God. Her misery was put aside, to be no more thought of. It lay there, the invisible cross, upon her breast - the diamond one she always wore did not even re- mind her of the one scarred upon her breast. It was suggestive to her, at times, of a father's kindly gift, and, never-ceasingly now, of those deep revelations which cluster around that symbol of our holy religion. Her thoughts were gathered now from the garden of Gethsemane; her hopes were nourished by angels in their own bright homes above. Already were they laboring upon the crown of gems to grace her brow, and her robe of spotless purity was in the loom of heaven. Early one morning came a note, from Lady Glenville, addressed to Clara, but containing an invi- tation for Edith to pass a week with her. When seated at the breakfast-table Clara gave the message, and asked Edith if she would like to accept. "O, yes; I wish to go; but when does she ask me?     - "She urges your coming at once.' "Then I will go to-day." "Seems to me you are in great haste to leave us,   "FE AND ALONE.       107 Edith, for the Lady Blanche," said Gerard; "for my part, I think she is the silliest woman in all England; and how Irving and Clara can see so much to like in her is beyond my comprehension." "I am sure I don't like her," -said Edith. "Then why should you want to visit her?" "That is the very'thing I cannot tell; but I do." "Irving intends to ride there after dinner, and he will take you over," said Clara. "No, no; Gerard will take me, and he can give Kate Mellan the call he promised on his way back. The ride together would give neither Irving nor my- self any pleasure, and I don't see why Gerard should look so cross about it: only think of Kate Mellan." !"Nonsense, Edith; I should hardly take the trouble to go a mile out of my way to call on her." "Not when you suit each other so well? She never talks with Clara without mentioning you." "She has one idea which is like you; for all you ever talk with me about is school." "Do you really know anything?" "Not much; but would you have me learned. like Irving?" "O, no, indeed; not his kind of knowledge. That is dark and unsafe; but some to make use of in every- day life."  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7083-00000054"/> 108      LIFE AND ALONE. "I think I will offer myself for English tutor to Mrs. Bertrand," said Gerard, laughing. "That would never do," returned Edith; "you would try to get all the girls in love with you, and grow more vain and conceited than ever. Sometimes I think I would have you just as you are." "I wish you would," said Gerard, perfectly serious, as he quitted the breakfast-room to order the horses. Irving had sat in gloomy silence, apparently occu- pied with his meal, but losing not a word of their talk. "Your friend, Clara," remarked Lord Melville, pleasantly, "has- one rather unfortunate trait for a female -a sharp tongue." "I suppose we all have that, papa, if provoked," said Clara, quickly. The ride to Glenville Castle lay through a most charming country, over hill and dale, dotted here and there with elegant country-seats, whose extensive parks ravished the eye with their verdure; and then soon the road wound through a thick forest vocal with song; and next ran along the quiet border of a stream of water, which looked like a silver thread amid the surrounding green. Edith walked her horse thought- fully through the deep shade, and, once more on the open turf, cantered along with merry glee. Gerard was unusually silent; he had taken his first heart-   "FE AND ALONE.       109 lesson, and the knowledge sat strangely upon him. He was revolving in his mind if it were best to lose this present moment for speaking - not that he feared a refusal at all; but in what words could he best prove to Edith his sincerity? When riding through the wood she would bid him hold his tongue and feel sober; and in the open country her speed would prevent anything like conversation. The turrets of Glenville Castle rose full upon their view; a few moments more and they have reached its arched stone gateway; and Gerard fancied he saw its fair mistress leaning against one of the massive pillars, and that she had already spied them in the distance. Not a moment was to be lost: drawing closer to Edith, he laid his hand upon her horse's rein. Why could not the animal have stood still under that nervous grasp? Alas! he began to rear and prance, and in no little vexation Edith used her riding-whip on the offending hand, exclaiming, - "What do you touch my bridle for? Let go. Lady Blanche will think I manage my horse badly." There was no danger of William the Conqueror's  scene with Matilda being acted out here; for, by a skilful manoeuvre, Edith loosed his hold and preceded him to the entrance of the castle. Without assistance she sprang from her horse, tossed the bridle to a groom in waiting, and turned round to greet Lady Blanche.  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7083-00000055"/> "O       LIFE AND ALONE. The lady stood on the steps in a simple morning cos- tume, making her look even younger and more attrac- tive, while her greeting of Edith was kind in the extreme. Lord Glenville and Ida, the only daughter, were absent; and Gerard was not urged to prolong his stay. Lady Blanche gave him unceremoniously a commission to execute for her at her niece's,-the sooner attended to, the better for her pleasure, and he was rather compelled to hurry his adieu.   IJE AWD AWiNEi.       1" CHAPTER    VII. EDITH found the aspect of this new place one of gloom. The castle was a pile of buildings of dark stone, fortress-like, and very scant the beams of sun- light which could break through the closely iron- barred windows; the small diamond-shaped panes of glass were very ugly, and inside, light was almost effectually shut out by the massive folds of colored velvet draping all the windows. Numerous pictures hung one above the other on the walls, -whole gen- erations of ferocious-visaged ancestors looking grim- ly from their black frames in one eternal stare. The dark, oaken, high-back chairs and seats seemed fas- tened to the walls, or too heavy ever to be moved. No light, fanciful pieces of furniture graced any of the rooms. Everything was heavy and dark, and measured for its place. From the ceiling hung bronze chandeliers, with no gilding whatever, and filled with dark-green wax candles: lighted, they only made the reigning gloom more apparent. In the  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7083-00000056"/> "2       LIFE AND ALONE. music-room the entire furniture was of black velvet. The dining-room, with its horde of massive gold and silver, wore a brighter look. Edith's heart sunk within her as she entered the chamber assigned to her use. The stately bed, with its curtains and the draperied windows, effectually shut out both light and air, and no little fancy articles, here and there, gave evidence that the room ever was occupied before. She could only hope that all things would look brighter out of doors, where, at least, she could spend most of the time. Even there she was doomed to a feeling of disappointment; for the grounds around the castle seemed in unison with its inner gloom. Not a flower was to be seen; the walks and paths were bordered on each side by high, well-trimmed hedges, impossible to look through or over-; a small sheet of water was darkened by the. shade thrown by the trees on its , brink ; birds of bright plumage seemed to have de- serted the spot, and those of darker hue only made their homes amid the trees; and quantities of brown ivy and gray moss hung over the turrets of the castle, creeping -down along the windows to aid in shutting out sunlight. In this gloomy abode the servants -wore a solemn, grave aspect, looking more like additional pieces of furniture than living human beings; while Edith, in her black robe, did not en-   "FE AND ALONE.       113 liven the' scene. Truly, the only sunbeam In the house was Lady Blanche herself, gracefully moving to and fro, like an embodied spirit from some brighter realm. "Edith," asked her hostess, as the two sat together the evening of her arrival, " shall I not invite Kate Mellan here, to make your time pass more agreeably, especially as Ida is not at home?  "O, no, Lady Blanche; she would be entirely out of place here, and give offence to the very portraits on the wall. I think this place would do for Irving - just dark and sombre enough for his home." "And Clara, to share it with him, I suppose you would add." "No ; she is too good to have his moods inflicted upon her." "But," said Lady Blanche, " she loves him; and do you not think she could be happy in his society even here?" "No; I think not: she would soon find out he was not the real truth of her high-souled ideal; and his bad influence would gradually steal away her good intent to mould him, -if it be true we grow like the stronger-willed with whom we live." "You do not like Irving, I see plainly, Edith; but what do you think of Gerard?" 8  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7083-00000057"/> "4:      LIFE AND ALONE. i"Gerard -has not brain enough to go mad any, where; though I think he would groan away his life here." "Poor child I if you feel it so dull here, what must it be for Ida?" "She has her mother, Lady Blanche; though all places are alike to me, for thought is as free in one as another.,' "Can you tell me anything about your mother, dear, or of your own home?" and' Lady Glenville's voice trembled, and her whole manner was strangely agitated, as she put the simple question. "It is nearly two years since I was home," an- swered Edith, " and in the mean time no letters have been sent me, and I have not much to tell." "Poor child I I dare say not." ' "You call me, poor, Lady Blanche ; and yet I have all my wants supplied. Another lady called me lamentably homely; that was her expression of sym- pathy. I would give a great deal to be handsome, like Clara. Is Ida beautiful?" "Persons say she looks like me." "Then, to my idea, she has not beauty; for I have seen no change in your face since we first met." Lady Glenville yawned, rang for lights, their talk flagged, and Edith pleaded her long ride for excuse   "FE AND ALONE.       " to retire early. The next day, Lady Blanche kindly offered to continue Edith's lessons on the harp; and, while waiting in the music-room for her appearance, Edith took up -a simple English ballad, and sang sev- eral verses. She had nearly gone through the whole song, when a shriek fell upon her ear, -with the words, - "It is her mother's voice." She turned quickly round, and saw Lady Blanche fall heavily on the floor, and lie there without sign of life. Edith had not heard her come in, and did not imagine her singing was the cause.  What should she do? There lay Lady Blanche, pale, and motion- less; and the frightened girl gazed, for the first time, on what she  supposed was death.  But the scream had sounded loudly through the quiet house, and soon brought servants to her aid. They bore their mistress to her chamber, and, as Edith followed, one said to her,- "You had better not come in, miss. Mhy lady is often so. Rest and quiet are the best restoratives." The day wore away, and still Lady Blanche re- turned not to the parlor, nor, until evening, seemed to even remember she had a  guest. Then came the message that a severe headache would prevent her seeing Edith until morning. Edith, tired of wander-  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7083-00000058"/> "6      LIFE AND ALONE. ing about, and with nothing to do, began to think school was pleasanter than visiting. Her chamber had no closet, and the old habit was denied her, and night-time was long enough to be in that dreary room. The words of Lady Blanche, as she fainted, came back to her mind, and the question arose, Could she have known her mother? Had they been friends? Perhaps so; and she was the intimate friend referred to in that last interview. To show kindness to her child must be the reason she was invited to Glenville Castle. A thousand conjectures flitted through her brain; then slowly crept over her a chilling, strange feeling of fear; the portraits seemed to step down from their frames; her head grew dizzy; she at- tempted to rise, and fell forward into Irving's arms. Ie laid her gently down upon the sofa, called for no assistance, but bathed her head and hands in cologne, and seated himself by her side. Slowly she recov- ered, opened her eyes, and seeing who was near her, exclaimed, - "I know now whose presence called forth those horrid phantoms. I can almost feel their cold grasp again. Lady Blanche is quite ill; why do you re- main?" "To see you, Edith; I would guard you from, rather than excite, fear in you."   "FE AND ALONE,      117 ' You do excite my fears, and you could not guard me; your very presence is hateful to me. When my thoughts are occupied with you a moment, I feel a nameless dread. Say, is this love?" and she laughed wildly. Irving waited until her excitement was over, and then mildly replied, - "You know what love is; for you say the beggar boy is dear to you; and he is a mere phantom, a cre- ation of your own fancy. I would be the reality of him you dream about. Now, you do not know what you love, and this vague, haunting idea may prove a madness unto you. Let me warn you of that." "Irving Melville, are there any words stronger than I have used for me to express my detestation of your proffered love? Does my language fail to convince you, that you thus dare to renew the sub- ject? Do I not read you plainly enough, that you would give me another insight into the heart which has proved so false to Clara, so ungrateful to her parents, who love you as their son? I see evil in your eye, I hear it in every word you utter." "Edith, is there, then, so much sin in loving you, in finding you nearer my ideal than Clara, whom 'twas habit to love?" "Do you think to recommend yourself to me upon  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7083-00000059"/> "8       tIFE' AND' A;LONE. the ashes of another love, that you speak thus to me? or do you date sin from that event? Go back to your boyhood. Can you remember a holy thought, an unselfish action? Only a few weeks have I known you; but I firmly believe some selfish motive prompted your betrothal with Clara; for she could never lose in comparison with any one." "Then, Edith, what prompted my more sincere love for you?" "A difficulty in your way in the form of a mere school-girl. Your talents could not claim her respect; your beauty too slight a veil upon a world-incrusted heart; your fascinating manners could not conceal the little real gratitude you felt for your kindest friends; but this is idle 'talking, and, that we may for- ever understand each other, I consider every intima- tion of your love to me an act of perfidy towards Clara, whose guest I am. I intend no act of friend- ship towards her; your secret is safe; but in pity, as a stranger might feel compassion for another's woe, do I grieve for her, and despise you, who have laid this burden on my heart to bear." She left the room, and from her chamber window saw Irving departing in mad speed, horseback, down the avenue. A violent storm ushered in the ensuing day; and, as Lady Blanche and Edith sat together in   IIFE AND ALONE.       119 dull silence, gazing out upon the pattering rain-drops, the former suddenly exclaimed, - "Edith, I would like to hear you sing again." "No one likes my singing, Lady Blanche, and you fainted the only time you heard me." "My fainting had nothing to do with your music, dear; I am subject to those ill turns, and one hap- pened just at that time." "As you please," said Edith; and she rose to comply with her request; but in spite of herself, her voice sounded sad and dirge-like, while Lady Glenville wept, but said,-- "Go on, go on; these tears are a luxury unto me, and your singing reminds me of what I might have been." Sadder and sadder grew Edith's strain. The pent- up feelings of the child were spent in song, instead of expression given them to any human being; and her heart poured out its craving for sympathy in un- earthly melody, and heavily they struck the chords of memory on her who was a listener. The youthful songstress was perfectly unconscious of the power in her music. It had no effect upon herself, save a feeI- ing of relief when she got up from the instrument, as if she were ready to start anew on life's journey, with an increase of strength to suffer alone, to hoard  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7083-00000060"/> 1zU       LIFE AND ALONE. up feeling until another hour of music should give it vent. Lady Glenville listened with rapt attention, and when she had done, involuntarily exclaimed,- "Edith, there never was but one voice like yours." "Yesterday, Lady Blanche, you said, 'It is her mother's voice.' I have no recollection of ever hear- ing singing at home; but, O, if you know aught of my mother, tell me;" and she flung herself upon her knees before her, adding, passionately, "She is dead! Surely it can do no harm, and my heart aches to know something of her history." "Answer me, Edith, was she ever happy?" "I do not know, Lady Blanche, but I think not. She was cold and silent. I never heard her laugh, and she was strange to me." "And your father -what of him?" "He. was seldom at home; but why do you ask me these questions?" "Because, Edith, your mother and I were school- mates together, and I felt interested in her fate." "Were you intimate friends?" asked Edith, look- ing anxiously at her. After a pause of some length, Lady Glenville replied,- "No; we were not friends. I knew her but little; and our intercourse was not of a pleasant nature." Edith rose disappointed. What to her would be   "FE AND ALONE.       121 any tidings of a relative, now no more, from a person who owned she disliked her? and she said, sadly,- "Then, Lady Glenville, you shall answer none of my questions, or those I would have put; for very sacred to me is the memory of my mother, and I would have her name mentioned only in terms of love and respect." "And I would speak of her in none other, Edith. You have misunderstood me. In a very large school the interests of the girls sometimes clash, disturb- ances arise which are nothing in themselves, yet leave an unpleasant impression on the mind." Edith made no reply, and the conversation dropped; but she felt her first feeling of dislike towards Lady Blanche ever on the increase, and she wished daily her visit was at an end. The evening of that same day Edith was surprised by her hostess referring to their morning conversation, by putting into her hand a small locket, and asking if she would like to see a miniature of her mother. A burst of tears was the only reply. Lady Blanche continued, - "In the back part is her hair; but a name is en- graven there I do not care for you to see." Edith gazed upon the painting. It was a true like- ness, and her companion expected another burst of grief. Not so. Slowly she turned her deep-sunken eye upon Lady Blanche, and asked, -  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7083-00000061"/> 122      LIFE AND ALONE. "How came this to be in your possession, and you not friends?" "Chance threw it into my hands. I told you there was a name engraven on the inside; and that prevents my parting with it. Otherwise it should be yours. You see the little plain ring I wear; these two arti- cles are all that remain to me of love and happiness. It was to have some private talk, and show you this miniature, that I invited you here; but I find, not- withstanding my wish, I am totally unfit to talk much of the past. Your next visit here will be under hap- pier auspices. Ida will be at home, and I want very much that you two should like each other." Before Edith could reply, a loud ring startled them both, and Lady Blanche exclaimed, - "I know that ring; he has come sooner than I expected." A few moments more, and Lord Glenville, with Ida, entered the room. "Ha I I thought so," he exclaimed, on seeing Edith, while Ida occupied herself with her mother. When the four sat down to the supper-table, there was restraint visible in the little party. Ida attempted to talk, hoping that the manner of her parents would escape Edith's notice. She did not know how discern- ,ing was the little mute person opposite her--how y   "FE AND ALONE.       123 quickly she had comprehended that her presence was not wanted by- her host; and it was that conviction prompted the slight excuse given to withdraw to her own room as soon as the uncomfortable meal was over. "What new-consolation does the Lady Blanche seek in the company of this child?" asked Lord Glenville, in his most contemptuous tone. No reply was vouchsafed, and he went on :- "Did I not make known in terms sufficiently ex- plicit that there should be no intercourse with even the youngest member of that family? I am aware of your whole system of duplicity; but this new medium of communication shall pretty effectually be stopped. This small baggage can be removed with little cer- emony." "Ida, go and seek Edith," languidly remarked her mother. "I am not blind to your daughter's danger, madam, and shall avert all injury by placing her with my sister." "Ah, indeed!" sneered the lady. "I will, at least, save my child from your pernicious influence, madam, and also, if possible, keep from her the knowledge of her mother's degradation." "You are correct, my lord; my degradation was  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7083-00000062"/> [24      LIFE AND ALONE. commenced when I married an old reprobate for his wealth." "And for his name, also, madam." "No, sir; the name I would have borne, by some foul means, is known to you. You can well imagine how hateful yours is in comparison." "Your confession comes too late, Lady Glenville." "Yes; too late for my own happiness; but if you have anything to complain of, have I no injuries at your hands? What use have you made of the knowl- edge of my early error?" { Error, lady I You call vice by a very gentle name. No need of more disguise; I am now in possession of all the facts." "Decency, Lord Glenville, would have won them from me at any time; a more gentlemanly bearing to- wards me would so have worked upon my better feeling that you might have possessed my respect." She had overshot her mark, and roused the worst passions in the man before her. The barrier of cold ceremony usually maintained in their interviews was broken down, and a torrent of abusive epithets was showered down upon her head. Facts and falsehoods were so mixed up together in his tirade that she was thrown off her guard by the many startling revelations, and at last seemed a crushed, if not a guilty, woman.   "FE AND ALONE.       125 Did the old man deem his satisfaction equal to the ruin he caused? The last frail tenure of home-peace was broken. He knew all her secret - and by what neans? There had been times in her married life when Lady Blanche had dim revealings of a wife's duty, and had attempted to redeem the past by efforts to regard kindly, at least, the man unto whom she had sold herself; but now -the pleadings of a better re- solve would never be heard again.

The hardest part of life for the two ill-mated to bear, will be when chance throws them together. The decency and restraints of society no longer observed, the quarrelsomeness of age and discontent shall find full vent on the defenceless -woman. O, who shall lift the veil, and show in the sacred hours of home the deceived and the deceiver without their masks? No eye would care to scan the page which teems only with disgust, and the more revolting, the nearer to the truth would be the scene if depicted. Though Lady Blanche ceased to cajole the old man, I know not but that it was a deeper deg- radation to live on in the outward expression of a full contempt. In the morning Ida knocked gently at the door of Edith's room, and was admitted. She bore in her hands a small tray with breakfast upon it, and set- ting it down, she blushingly remarked, - "There is trouble in the lower regions, and you would have had no meal if it had not been for me. Last night papa decided, suddenly, to leave home with mamma. The servants are all busy, though he is just as likely to change his mind again." Edith ate her breakfast in silence. Ida went on. "The carriage is to take you home first, and mam- ma bade me say good by for her, as she is suffering with one of her ill turns this morning. We shall meet   "FE AND ALONE.      1I soon at Mrs. Bertrand's, and mamma wishes it ar- ranged that we room together, and be very intimate." Please say good by to your mother for me. It is impossible for us to room together. I am not intimate with any one, and we shall scarcely see each other at school." "Then it cannot be so very pleasant there. Are not the girls allowed to associate together?" asked Ida. "Some do--nay, all--I believe. I only said you would not be intimate with me." "I am very sure I shall not wish to if it is disa- greeable to you," said Ida. Edith smiled. She felt another enemy was gained, a proffered friendship lost; and hastily bidding the offended beauty good morning, went down stairs, found the carriage already at the door, seated herself, and, as she was whirled back to Melville Castle, occupied herself with these thoughts : "A few more days, and I shall be at school again, in the same old room. I did not know before how much I loved it. Why did I imagine visiting was to be so pleasant? and how mistaken Mrs. Bertrand was in saying I should en- joy it! Next term I shall have two new studies- German and the harp; but I shall not drop my Italian."  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7083-00000064"/> 128       LIFE AND ALONE.  .  The last thought was the torchght to memory, and the still pleasanter image of the beggar boy ruled the hour. The carriage drew up to the castle door, and there stood Clara, beautiful as ever, to welcome her back. Edith could hardly restrain an unusual impulse to fling both arms around her neck and give her a kiss; but, 'tis being intimate, was the quick thought, and she received, or rather suffered, Clara's embrace, giving inone in return. Gerard was loud in his wel- come, and declared if she had not come that day he should have stormed the castle, and brought her back by force; but he added,- "s You look thin as a mummy, Edith. Now confess you were moped to death." "Indeed I was, and frightened also. Last night Lord Glenville came home, and I took to my bed at once. . I can assure you I was glad enough when Ida told me this morning I might come away." "How did you like Ida?" asked Gerard. "O, I have offended her; and Kate Mellan I have not seen at all." "Poor child I you have been pursued with ill luck, you see, since you parted from me ;, but you must have had an early breakfast. Come, eat now; and you had better eat for a week to come, instead of talking, or we shall have to be chasing the air for   "FE AND ALONE.'       129 you. I, too, have pined during your absence, and shall be glad to resume my usual appetite." "I must go to my room now," said Edith, " and take my things off. I will listen to your nonsense when I come back." On entering her chamber, Edith saw-a package upon the table addressed to her. It was the first time in her life she had to untie one addressed to herself, and she experienced all the delight a younger child might feel looking for Santa Claus gifts some Christmas morn- ing. Clara came in and told her that among a num- ber of books sent Lord Melville, from Germany, was this small packet directed to her; and in a letter his friend had desired her father to forward it to a Miss Merton, pupil at Madame Bertrand's seminary. "And as Miss Merton happened to be here," added Clara, laughing, "I hope'it'contains some glad sur- prise for you. But this is all papa or I know of the matter.' Alone again, Edith did not open her package, and in the evening, on Clara's asking what it contained, was obliged to confess she did not yet know. The following day, as if she had waited until weary of imagining, or had battled with her curiosity, she took her package, slowly and carefully unwound paper after paper until she came to a small morocco case.

Yet it is my own, thought the astonished girl, as she gazed with glowing cheeks upon the sparkling stones. The family no less wondered from whom it came. Lord Melville read his letter again, but he dis- covered nothing new. Edith's active imagination did not let it long remain a mystery to her, and her solv- ing was: The beggar boy had gone to Germany to pursue his studies, had never ceased to think of her, and had embraced the first safe opportunity to send her .this proof of his remembrance. As to its value, she might know by that how well off he was in money matters. And this explanation added no little intensity to the pleasure with which she clasped the chain around her neck. Gerard laughingly asked why she did not wear the cross, as Clara did hers, without seeming to know she had one on. "Because," answered Edith, "Clara7s is nothing but a gift from Irving." "And, for all you know, yours is a present from me," said Gerard. "I know better than that; you would have given me a dog or a side-saddle."   LIFE AND ALONE.       13 CHAPTER    VIII. "IRVING, I wish you would give me your advice," said Gerard, one morning, following him into the library. "I declare I am a most wretched fellow." "What now, Gerard? Fred Erskine's horse won, and you a heavy loser?" "Pshaw! Who said anything about horses? Do you think nothing but losing a bet can affect a man? I tell you I am desperately in love." "You had not told me this before ;'so I was igno- rant of the cause of your misery." "Yet you do not ask whom it's with." "Very true; but having been a spectator of your devotion lately to Kate Mellan, and hearing you speak of none other the last four weeks, I fancy I know without asking." "Then, for once, the clear-sighted, far-seeing, deep- thinking Irving Melville, is confoundedly mistaken; for I would not give my best racer for a dozen Kate Mellans. Try again."

"Then, Gerard, I am at a loss; unless you have discovered some latent charm in Lady Blanche, and your dislike, so often expressed, has been only to con- ceal a different feeling." "A different nonsense I Where are your senses, Irving?" "In my own possession, which I fear yours are not." "My senses are; but my heart for a long time has belonged to Edith Merton." "Good Heavens! Do you know what you are about?" burst from Irving's lips; then, controlling himself by a masterly effort, he calmly said, - "To Edith Merton - did you say?" "Yes, Irving; and I knew you would be provoked. Your love for' Clara prevents your seeing anything amiable in any other person; but you must overcome your prejudices against Edith, and like her for my sake. Why, man, how pale you look!" "It is nothing; I am not over and above well this morning. My advice you wanted. In what way can I be useful to you?" "Not your advice, exactly, but your opinion. Should you not judge Edith was attached to me?" "Indeed, she may be; I cannot tell," said Irving, hoarsely.   "FE AND ALONE.       133 "No; she is such a queer elf, no one could tell; but have you not noticed she is more familiar with me than with any other person?" "Yes; but that would not tell in your favor." "Well, Irving, I'll tell you what: if Edith is not mine, I'll forswear forever all womankind. I never was really in love before; and I honestly think if you had not been engaged to Clara, you would have found out how fascinating Edith is; and her music is superb. She would have given a rare song on Clara's birth- night; but when I tried to find her to urge her sing- ing, she nor Clara was not in the rooms, and after- wards Kate Mellan did put it out of my head." "Can I do anything for you?" said Irving, rising. "Why, no; your melancholy face would never speed my wooing. Besides, Edith dislikes you; but if I succeed, you might break the matter with my father, and put in a word there." "Then you have doubts of your success?" asked Irving. "Yes; every modest man should doubt in some degree his power of pleasing; but still I think she loves me." "A modest acknowledgment, truly," muttered Ir- ving; then added aloud, "I must leave you, Gerard. I have business with Lord Melville; but, when you  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7083-00000067"/> 134      LIFE AND ALONE. wish, command me; I will do everything in my power." "That I know you will, my dear brother;" and the two parted. "I wish I was as sure of Edith's love as he is of Clara's," thought Gerard; "he knew quite surely his way was clear there; but Edith is not so easily read. Once mine, some of her queer ways I'll alter. That deuced fuss she makes about a beggar boy, ask- ing every person she meets if they know him; but, after all, there is little I would change in her." Clara entered the library in search of a book. "What, you here, Gerard, alone? Who ever saw you in this room before? You must have taken up Edith's habit of thinking." "Clara, how quickly this year will pass I and then you will become Irving's wife, and go to some other home." Hastily seizing the first book she could lay her hand upon, without a reply, Clara left the room. "Well, she might have staid a moment," mut- tered Gerard. "To go out just as I was about' to open my heart to her! and then to blush so at such an old story perfectly ridiculous! O, misery-- this having to bear trouble without sympathy I will find Edith, and know my fate at once." W   "FE AND ALONE.       135' In the hall he encountered Kate Mellan, just come in for a visit, and conducting her to the drawing-room, in most pleasant chat he forgot his feelings of misery. "I have some news to tell you," said Kate. "Ah!" replied Gerard; "let us have it, Miss Mellan; this family are on the rack for the uncom- mon article." "O, it will not interest you; only the young la- dies, and Edith especially." "Then, of course, it interests me; but go on." "Well, sir, what do you care to know that my cousin, Ida Glenville, is to become a pupil of Mrs. Bertrand's, and room with Miss Merton, at the espe- cial request of Lady Blanche?" "You are mistaken there," interrupted Edith, "for nothing would tempt me to room with her, or any one of the girls." "You are very complimentary to Clara and myself, Miss Merton." "Edith has only spoken the truth, Kate," said Clara; "we should all prefer to room alone, and I will take this opportunity to tell you, it is my ipten- tion to have a room to myself this last year. I can study better alone, and you will have no difficulty to accommodate yourself with a much pleasanter com- panion."  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7083-00000068"/> 136       LIFE AND ALONE. Kate bit her lip with vexation as she replied,- "Indeed I shall, Clara, and be forced to put up with Ida--a rather poor substitute for you. I do hope you will change your mind, and let us room together, as last term." "Impossible, Kate. I have much to learn the com- ing year, and solitude will be of great advantage to me." "I shall see nothing of you," urged Kate. "You will see her, but have no long talks with her," interrupted Edith. The words were simple, but they had struck home, and darting an angry glance at the apparently uncon- scious Edith, Kate rose to take leave. The angry flush upon her cheek deepened as she wondered to herself if Edith Merton could have discovered how much she was interested in Gerard. No particular affection for Clara prompted this desire to room with her. The charm of her society was -she was Ge- rard's sister. Edith had easily read the motive, and again thought she saw the wisdom of her mother's prohibition, and felt she ran no risk. Her own feel- ings towards Clara were undefinable; she tried to think as little about her as possible, lest she should break the spirit of her mother's command. "Come, girls; .let us have one more horseback i    "FE AND ALOV J, Li. ride," exclaimed Gerard. "One more before you will return to school. Say not nay, sister mine; for I am determined. Hurry up, Irving." Gerard alone seemed to be anxious for the ride; but to oblige him all agreed. The open air did some- thing towards removing the evident depression of the little party. What was unusual, Edith kept close to Clara, and at length Gerard, after sundry sly hints at her horse, plainly asked for a race, adding, in an un- der tone,- "We will leave the lovers behind to say a thou- sand last tender words." Edith bent her deep-sunken eye upon him, and sat- isfied that his ignorance of how matters stood was not assumed, put her horse into a canter, and was out of sight in a moment. Gerard pursued in mad terror, fearful she would lose command of the gay steed on which she was mounted; but she rode well, as she did everything else, and, when it suited, reined in her horse, and permitted herself to be overtaken. They were far in advance of Irving and Clara, and Edith turned her horse's head to ride back and meet them. Gerard pleaded in vain for her to go on to a place where was a charming view he wished to show her, till, losing all patience, he exclaimed, - "I verily believe, Edith, you are determined I shall  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7083-00000069"/> 138      LIFE AND ALONE. have no opportunity to tell you how dearly I love you." The woods rang with a merry burst of girlish laughter; but the ice had been broken, and Gerard waited until her mirth was spent, and then said, - "You may laugh as much as you please, if after- wards you will grant me a sober hearing." "Then tell me, again and again, that you love me," said Edith, "and I shall have food for fun." "You are at liberty, Edith, to ridicule my manner of telling you; but throw none upon the fact, I be- seech you." The tones of his voice sounded unusual. Edith saw in a moment that he was in earnest, and turned towards him with a beseeching look, as if, had she dared, she would have begged for no more in that strain.; but his face forbade. "Will you hear me now?" asked Gerard. "Would you have me listen to a tale of love when I have no regard for you save the mere liking of one for another?" "Yes, Edith; give me the poor satisfaction of tell- ing how dear you are to me, how truly I would study your happiness in every thought and act of my life. I may not appear now all that you might wish for, but my aim shall be to prove myself always at least   Ll'FJ AtND AJUM . LN Y worthylto be loved. Even if you do not care for me now, may I not hope to win you by my devotion? I will wait, and wait, and struggle to be worthy of your love." "You are worthy now, Gerard, and of -a better love than I could offer. It is myself, so strange and unlike others, who would be unworthy to fill the place you would put me in." In a transport of joy Gerard poured out his grati- tude. "For what?" thought Edith; "for my refusing him?--There, Gerard, I knew you would rather I told you the truth. Kate Mellan will make you a much better wife than I, and would have you for the asking." "Ask whom?" said Gerard, in no very gentle terms; "what can you mean, Edith? Do you not love me?" "No, not at all; but I like you. Did you not un- derstand me before?" Gerard was speechless. The words so nicely ar- ranged, with which he meant to plead his cause, failed hin in the utterance. That one moment of joy, suc- ceeded by disappointment so effectually silenced him. Edith quickened her horse's pace, and rode on alone. Must they part thus? had he not been kind to her?  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7083-00000070"/> "O       LIFE AND ALONE. She would- go back; and suiting the action to the thought, she rode towards him, saying, - "Gerard, you have been very, very good to me; we will try and forget forever this last hour. After to-morrow you will not see me for a very long time. I have not been forbidden to be intimate with you; and shall we not still be good friends?" "Yes," answered Gerard, taking hope again; "and you will try to love me, Edith, as Clara does Irving?" "I will, as Irving does Clara," replied Edith. "A thousand thanks, dear one, for that happiress, and I will trust all else to the future." "Be silent, Gerard, or you will make me hate you, as I do Irving. You are determined to think only as you wish, and misunderstand my every word." "What shall I think you mean, then?" asked the poor, bewildered Gerard. "Nothing; only that I hope you will one day marry Kate Mellan, and that I shall like her better for your sake'." "Edith, are you crazy? ' "No; not crazy, Gerard, only lamentably homely. Tell me, now, do you think I shall always be so plain? Sometimes I fancy that as I grow older my eyes will come out fuller; they have grown darker since I have been here. Of course I shall never be blooming, like   "FE AND ALONE.       141 Clara; but then, you know, I am black, and she is fair. 'How very beautiful she is! I wish I looked like her." Gerard rode by her side in gloomy silence, and Edith continued,- { Are you tired of talking, Gerard? You seemed languid when you began. Let us go faster, and meet Clara and Irving." "Edith, remember you promised to love me as Clara does Irving." "No; I did not say that. Besides, you called me crazy; and I like you even less than I did. I don't think I care to be intimate with you. How strange that you don't feel that you will certainly marry Kate Mellan!" "I do not love her; so why should you say so?" "Because you ought. She does you, and you are so much alike- so perfectly suited to one another." "You speak the truth, dear Edith; I have not sense enough for you." "I did not say so, dear, dear Gerard." "O, Edith, I feel it, and you have made me 1wretched." "I never made any person otherwise. Life and alone, thus far, has been my fate.

I shall feel that I may exercise the power within me, and make others happy? My school days must be ended, and then I can make friends. O, they shall be only the good and the sad. I shall try and become like the good, and comfort the sorrowful. Gerard, if you will promise faithfully never to tell, --for I hardly dare own it to myself, at least in words, I do intend to marry." "And what girl does not? And, Edith, you will let me have the hope that I may be the happy man?" "Happy? 6, yes. And now, Gerard, never lisp one word; but I do, soon as my school days are over, hope to marry the beggar boy." Gerard was answered. He could doubt no longer his own fate, nor had he mind enough to really appre- ciate the strange girl who had rejected him in so comical a manner. She only fascinated him more and more. He now thought himself added to the list of martyrs who had died, or were dying, for love. Prob- ably from that moment all Nature put on her darkest hue for him, and his life merged into the deep shadow of a vanished happiness. At least, he thought so; but time proved he had only lost a fancy. He ima- gined he had dived into dark waters, and brought up the bitterest woe the human heart could bear and live. I would not be sure, but it seems to me the words   "FE AND ALONE,       143 "Iife and alone " fell from his lips. In truth they were the burden on his heart. He determined to brave his hard fate without sympathy, and called up on his woe-begone countenance anything but the ex- pression of a rejected lover. His only pleasure now should be in the remembrance of the little 'elf. He had fancied her former allusions to the beggar boy to be some joke best known to herself. Now he did not doubt there was some person to whom she was cn- gaged, and had bestowed upon him that odd title. As for himself, he should never be married. Where should he find another Edith? Then the thought crossed him that, after he had seen her settled in life, it would be pleasant to recall that she had recom- mended Kate Mellan to him. Miss Mellan's image, as he rode on now in silence, at length took absolute possession of his mind; and as he jumped from his horse to assist Edith from hers, he muttered, - "Thank Heaven, I need fear no rejection there; " and his sorrow was comforted. It was 'the last evening of vacation time. There was no need of disguise; gloom evidently rested on the home circle at Melville Castle. Even the transient guests, there for the past week only, could not but feel regret at the near departure of Clara for so long a time. Conversation was at its lowest ebb, and music  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7083-00000072"/> "4       LIFE AND ALONE. was asked for. Clara's and Irving's voices mingled together in song. Was it chance they did not har- monize? Clara felt it with a shudder, and, turning to Edith, asked her to take her place. "I had rather sing alone," said Edith, as she took her seat at the piano. "I do not feel my voice is in tune to-night." Could it be that she feared a failure, and really made an effort to sing? If so, she sur- passed any former attempt. The sound of the instru- ment was lost in the voice which swelled forth its fullest power in long, rich tone. No sadder, softer notes mingled in her melody. To an ecstasy of pleas- ure, in unison with her present mood, she raised her auditors and kept them there in a transport of delight. It was the gladness of childhood rolling over her heart, to which her voice gavie utterance in appropriate words. One note lent its strength to another, until her whole heart seemed ringing out with unearthly skill-its highest key of joy. Few ever heard Edith laugh but in song; and the garnered merriment of years to-night burst out in strains of most melodious glee. In her usual singing was a tear in her voice; but more pow- erful, if less sweet, was it when laughter trilled every note. Soon she seemed to change her magic strain to the quiet of a smile, and, clear and calm, sung on her beautiful words; but they were only a prelude to the   "FE AND ALONE.       145 next wild burst. Clara turnedher eye upon Irving, marked well the proud despair with which he listened, and the cold blood trickled drop by drop round her heart. Gerard had bowed his head in both hands, and experienced some faint idea of his lost hope. All present were differently affected by the music they stood entranced to hear. What a poor tribute to such power of song would have been the language of praise I Not one word was spoken, and Edith thought, as here- tofore, that her music gave no pleasure. How unlike this cold silence to the applause Clara always received! It was not praise she craved; but her heart did yearn to thrill for a moment with the knowledge that she had given pleasure. That night Clara Melville drew her chair by the embers of a dying fire, unmindful of heat or cold, sleelk or darkness, as she sat alone in her chamber, and held long and solemn commune with herself. She probed her heart with stern questions: Was it the strength of a sinful pride which enabled her to quell all emotion, and meet Irving with the gentle converse of a sister's love? Was it a revulsion of feeling, and now only deep contempt for him who had wronged her? Was it an energy of recklessness growing out of the depths of despair which enabled her to give up the sun to her life? And her heart made response to each query with the clearness of 10  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7083-00000073"/> "6       IFE AND ALONE. truth. She had dethroned her soul's ideal, and given the remnant of her love unto Him from whom it so long had strayed ;*and the strength with which she met each day's revealings was from above, and unfail- ing as the source from whence it sprung. There was no change in her feelings towards Irving. She knew there could be no death-note to love like hers. It ty aside in her breast, to be no more thought of in this time-world of ours, but in eternity to become again a recognized joy. Purer was it in its repose than when sullied by a thought, holier in its slumber, for it bore no dross of earth. There was no despair now in her heart, but the germs of a perfect resignation. It is true Nature at times had the control, and the cold blood trickled round her heart; she felt, and shrank from, the icy drops; there came with them a warning, a sinking sensation of every faculty; but always strength was granted her to suffer and endure. The strong-minded girl allowed herself no luxury of grief; she feared to lose in a burst of feeling her own self- respect, and weaken her powers of control at another time. To-night there was no indulged-in reverie over the events of the last six weeks--that short period of time which had wrought such a mighty change in her destiny, in her whole character. There was one regret which did travel back into the past,--her transient   "FE AND ALONE.       14:Y feeling of envy and dislike for Edith, - and she num- bered it among the things to be repented of. Before retiring, she wrote a long letter, locked it, up in a box, and attached the key to her chatelaine. For the sake of Irving's present position with her father, she was forced to conceal their relation to each other. He was on the threshold of some political aggrandize- ment, from which a word' from her might hurl him; and, however her father might feel compelled to vent his vengeance upon him, she knew enough of human nature to understand that another feeling would clash with parental love. The parent would grieve for his child, the man would lament the failure of his ambi- tious projects. Knowing how ambition also swayed Irving's mind, she had no fear that he would thwart her purpose by a premature disclosure. She had wit- nessed, with concealed surprise, the perfectly unem- barrassed ease with which he treated her in the pres- ence of others; and when alone together, his proud, stern nature gave no evidence of consciousness that he had wronged her. Clara could not complain, for on the very night of the denouement she had herself established their future position. She had pressed the kiss upon his brow and whispered, "Brother!"He, wrapped in one wild thought of Edith, would hardly own to himself that Clara had ever been other to him.  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7083-00000074"/> 1i8      LIFE AND ALONE. The memory of a long devotion was lost in the passion of a few short weeks; setting forth, in simple truth, the depth of man and woman's love at the stage when a new fancy usurps the place of the feeling of years in the breast of the one, while the other meekly bows her head and resigns all claim. The question, Had Irving ever loved Clara? will solve itself in coming circumstances, though in individuality of character Edith was his counterpart. Lord Melville announced at the breakfast-table his own intention of taking the girls back to school; but, imagining he read disappointment upon the faces of the young men, he smilingly added that the party could be enlarged. His offer was rejected, and the moment drew near for the final adieus to be spoken. What a world of feeling trembles upon that simple word, good by! Clara found it easier to say than ever before, and Edith's was uttered in cold uncon-  cern. She extended her hand to Irving because Clara did, but drew her glove on first, saying, - , I fear to paralyze my hand if it touches yours, so prone to wield the pen in bold and impious thought;  and then, laughing, she turned to Gerard with, "How sorry Kate Mellan will be not to see you with us I but I am glad your father is going. I shall not dare   "FE AND ALONE.      149 attack his dignity with my nonsense, and we shall have a charmingly quiet drive; so good by." They were gone. The young men glanced at each other, and ITring broke the silence. "You have offered yourself, Gerard, and been re- fused? ' "Zounds! How do you know that? Our last con- versation was of an acceptive-rejective nature. If there be any such terms, your learning can inform you. - "I am sorry for you, then, Gerard; a doubt is hard to bear d "Precious little doubt I bear as to ever having Edith Merton for a wife." "' Then, Gerard, you are not made so wretched by her rejection as you imagined.' "It is no fault of yours if the wound be not probed and painful enough;" and the first unkind feeling in his breast towards his brother had its date from that moment. But Irving was too well versed in human nature to allow the sting of his words to remain. With con- summate skill he soothed Gerard, drew from him the whole story, and held out flattering hopes for the fu- ture. Well might Irving fear, under existing circum- stances, to rouse any suspicion in Gerard's breast, or  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7083-00000075"/> 150       LIFE AND ALONE. to anger him. Arrived at school, teachers and pupils gave warm welcome to Clara Melville, while Edith passed unnoticed to her own room. Again in that dear spot, she was amply compensated as her eye fell upon each familiar object. Her first glad impulse was to throw herself down upon the floor beside the open closet door, and think. Poor child I there is an alloy even in the simplest pleasures. Thoughts of her mother presented themselves first to her mind; it seemed as if they had been parted, and now met again.  "Mother dear," she exclaimed, "I will be true to your command; but you must strike that chord upon your harp which is Edith's note, and let me hear it in the peace of heart I shall have when thinking of thee. I have gazed once upon your likeness ; but I love bet- ter to think of you in your present happiness, and to hear your voice from the spirit-land thrill my being. I know you are wending your way farther and farther from earth; but sound can travel back without ever growing weary. I can feel the changed melody of the note as you rise higher. It is clearer, mother dear, and more powerfully urges me onward to fulfil every duty. Sleep does not drown it, and morning brings a brighter consciousness of thy blest destiny." Her thoughts then lost all tinge of sadness, and the   "FE AND ALONE.       151 image of the beggar boy resumed its sway. She would be very near him through the study of her German books; and now she wondered if the cross he sent her might not be more significant, perhaps an emblem of the religion he had embraced; but that was a solemn mystery she would leave for him to re- veal. Mrs. Bertrand had followed Clara to her room, who knew for what purpose, and nerved herself to answer any questions. Mrs. Bertrand first inquired if she had attained her object in Edith's visit, and Clara answered, No; she had been no more intimate with her than at school. "Do  you not understand her any better, my love?" "No, ma'am; I think I both admire and love her more; but she is as unreadable as ever." "In society, dear, was she not more like other girls?" "She was modest and retiring, and her peculiarities less marked; but if noticed, she was her own singular self, and always interesting." "Well, my dear, I am so glad you enjoyed her so- ciety, and did not regret your invitation!" and with another embrace the satisfied woman quitted the room. Cold curdled the blood round Clara's heart; drop  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7083-00000076"/> 152       LIFE' - AND ALONE. by drop, longer this time, it fell with startling chill, as she murmured to herself, - "No; I am sure that I do not regret the invita- tion." Soon a summons came for her to rejoin her com- panions. - Solitude at that moment would have been a luxury to her; but there were no lessons to excuse her remaining in her room, and she sought her fellow- scholars, entered warmly into their pleasure at re- union, kindly relieved the embarrassment of the new comer, answered smilingly the thousand and one ques- tions of the vacation, its amusements, and of Edith. She might have said that never before was the gabble of school-girls so distasteful to her, and have envied Edith her very singularity, which obtained for her such unmolested quiet; but these suggestions were -banished on the moment, and she remained with her schoolmates until her withdrawal would pass unob- served. Clara Melville gone, a group of girls gath- ered round a new comer, and a dozen voices put the questions, "Is she not beautiful? Don't you like her? She is always just so pleasant, and we call her the queen of the school." "' Well you may," said another. "Nobody in any of the classes ever takes precedence of her, and, strange to say, we do not envy her."   "FE AND ALONE.       153 "I suppose the reason is," said a tall, thoughtful- looking girl, " she bears her honors as if she did not perceive them, and will leave off a lesson any hour to enlighten the veriest dunce in the school." "Well," said Kate Mellan, "if you think Clara handsome and so charming, you should see her broth- er Gerard; he is splendid, and as much more agreea- ble as day is brighter than night." "Not a good comparison, Kitty, for night has a glory -of its own, and the stars show us truths no day can reveal." "O, pshaw, Miss Percy I I did not intend to rouse any of your high strikes; you are always so high- flown.  Gerard Melville is full of fun, and a very intimate friend of mine. You need not look so, Ida Glenville; he has been devoted to me all this va- cation." "Why, Kate, you were only introduced to him at Clara's party, not quite two weeks ago, and I am sure he seemed a great deal more pleased with Edith Merton." "-Pleased with Edith Merton!" laughed a chorus of girls; " that seems a likely story. Why, it would not be a possible thing for that sallow face of hers and sepulchral voice to chain a gentleman to her side five  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7083-00000077"/> 154      LIFE AND ALVONE. minutes 1 But you say, Kitty, your friend is full of fun; perhaps he was making sport of her." , Very gentlemanly," muttered Ida. "You know he is a gentleman and a nobleman, Ida," said the now enraged Kitty; and putting her arm within that of Agnes Walters, she went off to make her the repositary of her secrets. t      ,   "FE 'AND A LONE.      155 CHAPTER    IX. MANY go back to their school days as to the hap- piest portion of existence, forgetful that then the trials and vexations of every day were as hard to bear as griefs of a later date, proportioned to the judgment, strength, and experience to meet them. The view Edith Merton took of life was, perhaps, as well as another's--to find exquisite pleasure in reverie and anticipation, to be contented with the present, to possess a cultivated strength of mind which should prevent despondency and disappointment in realizing so far below the standard of imagination-a faith beautiful in its simplicity, strong in its exercise. What would be thought hard and unnatural in the mother's injunction was of great benefit to the child. If she were deprived of pleasant intercourse with those of her own age, she gained hours of study, which well prepared her mind to struggle with all changes and chances of life. If her hours of reverie were of an enervating, tendency, no less would have  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7083-00000078"/> 156       LIFE 'AND ALONE. been the foolish jabbering of school-girls. If the difference of her peculiar views and mode of life sub- jected her to mortifications, these were good lessons in humility. Thus far the trials-of her school life had mostly grown out of her isolated position, and had been bravely borne, sustained by the consciousness that she had been true to her mother's command. The following term presented some of a different kind. Soon after her return to school, though term bills were regularly paid, a former allowance for clothing, &amp;c., was sensibly diminished, and at length ceased altogether. Other faculties of her nature were called into exercise -to plan, to mend, to make, to econo- mize in every way; and the effort was harder to her than would have been the mastering of the most difficult language. A depth of pride was disclosed which the child never dreamed was among her faults; and hours of reverie seemed to merge, at last, more into the minute study of her own character. While the tedious hours of sewing passed, her thoughts were busy with self-examination, and dreams of the beggar boy were reserved for the twilight hour only. In time the poverty of her dress attracted attention from the scholars ; and many revenged themselves for what they considered a slight of their acquaintance by sly hints upon the rustiness of her 'black, and a   "FE AND ALONE.       157 thousand mean innuendoes which have such power to wound. True, it was little and contemptuous, un- worthy any notice, and would-have been little heeded by Edith, could she have foreseen any remedy; but future wants rose, before her, and every taunt of her schoolmates excited anew anxiety for that future. There were those in school bad enough to note the deeper flush on her cheek when any allusion to dress was made, and they would continue the subject until she felt every word was aimed at her. All this would take place while waiting in a recitation room for the teacher's appearance, or in the music hall. One day a paper was handed round for names to be put down opposite a required sum of money requisite to pur- chase some presents for the teachers, and it was pre- sented to Edith to sign; then all her native dignity had to be summoned forth to hand back the paper and look calm, as she answered,- "I have nothing to give I " To  whom, or how  at all, to any one -intimate with none - should she go and ask for help? or in what way raise a small sum of money herself? It was difficult to carry any plan into execution without Mrs. Bertrand's knowledge; and Edith shrank with renewed sensitiveness from asking her when she re- membered her name was not found among the long  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7083-00000079"/> 158       LIFE AND ALONE. list of others who had presented her some token of their regard. One morning, after a German recita- tion, Gonsalvo handed her two small volumes of Schiller, most elegantly bound, saying,- "I knew, Miss Merton, you would soon want these books, and, while purchasing some for the class, made choice of these two for you." Edith took the books, saw the mark upon them, and knew she was unable to pay the amount. Her hand trembled, her eye filled with scorching tears; but she laid the books upon the table without a word. The quick mind of the Italian comprehended instantly her dilemma. With a well-feigned air of disappoint- ment, lie exclaimed,- "Then you refuse this poor expression of my ap- probation for the best scholar in my class." "Is it a gift?" said Edith, raising her dark eye, full of the heart's burden, upon Gonsalvo. "I could ill afford such expensively bound books for study, when cheaper would answer the purpose as well." The effort had been made- to tell the truth; yet she did At know but the exposure of her limited means w/uld lower her in the eyes of the teacher she best liFed. She did not understand the expression of his ountenance, or know of the delight with which his whole soul was filled at her confession.   "FE AND ALONE.       159 He still pretended to feel hurt at her manner of re- ceiving his gift, and finally urged it upon her in terms which she could not reject and show him proper re- spect. The books were accepted, and she went back to her room saved from a present annoyance, as in a few days these new books- were to be needed by the class. Gonsalvo had achieved his purpose on the unsuspecting girl. He had thrown the first coil of his chain around her, and now, with caution and prudence on his part, could place her under obligations from which she could not extricate herself. He had spoken the truth when he called her the best scholar in the class, and he warmly appreciated her genius. To him her -face was a thousand times more beautiful than the faultless features of Clara Melville; but his true purpose was a scheme deep-laid and diabolical in the extreme. One day Edith sat in her room pon- dering how she should raise some money to replace her wardrobe. She could think of nothing but to part with her watch or diamond cross. The watch had been her mother's ; the cross was dear also; but when the two, as precious gifts, were considered, the watch was the dearest thing she owned on earth. She could not part with that. The diamonds also brightened as she gazed on them, and their lustre too was borrowed from the thoughts which had clustered  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7083-00000080"/> 160       LIFE AND ALONE. and lingered so often around the beautiful ornament. Still, she must part with it, and she thought the best thing would be to consult Gonsalvo as- to its value. He knew something already of her poverty, and there would be fewer questions to answer than if she ap- plied to any other person. The money raised from its sale would supply her wants for a very long time, and the day might come when she could redeem it. With these reflections she tried to hush the bitter regrets she felt at parting with it, when a knock at the door startled her. It was only a servant with a package for her. She opened it, and found a large roll of bank notes, together with a letter written in Italian, sighed Gonsalvo. She counted out the notes to the amount of two hundred pounds, and the letter ran as fol- lows : - MY PUPIL: The noble and dignified avowal you made of your present circumstances won my entire admiration and respect; and I offer the enclosed as a loan, to be paid whenever convenient. I know well the delicacy which will cause you to start back with disdain from this proffered loan: perhaps you may even deem me impertinent; but I take a very differ- ent view of the matter. As your teacher, I have a right to know and administer to your wants. No rel-   "FE AND ALONE. atlve has any claim upon me. As a rich and idle literary man, for the sake of pursuing a pleasant oc- cupation, and perhaps doing some little good in this far-famed institution, I am here; but not to earn a livelihood, I can assure you. Therefore you need have no hesitation in accepting my aid, that you by so doing could embarrass me; not at all. I should beg your acceptance of the amount, and be amply re- paid by your quicker advance in study, did I not feel your own good sense would refuse me, as I know it will aid you in not refusing to accept it as a loan. Your teacher, GONSALVO. Such was the wily Italian's note, and Edith' felt to refuse would be ungrateful and impossible. Nor had she any wish to: if no money came from home, she had still the means of payment within her power, for there was her diamond cross ; and -joy to her heart --she could retain that a little while longer. Gon- salvo was her teacher; there could be no harm in placing herself under obligations to him. Edith dwelt long upon his kindness -how quickly he had relieved her distress about the books, divined her present wants, and so delicately aided her. If, as he said, -p-rogress in study could reward him, how cheerfully  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7083-00000081"/> 162.      LIFE ANP ALONE. would she double her diligence No wonder she made astonishing advancement in German. Itwasa language well fitted to call out her thinking powers, and to fascinate completely. She roved throughits rich fields of literature, gathering materials for thought, and at every step of her onward way some faint idea arrested her. She had herself conceived the beauti- ful idea, and now found it expressed. Some days passed before she found an opportunity to thank Gon- salvo for his generosity, as she saw him only i the class; and at length she was obliged to make one by staying in the room after all the others had left. She walked straight up to the table where he sat, laid her hand upon his arm, saying,- "How can I thank you for so timely a relief from much embarrassment?  I must soon have tidings from home, when your money can be repaid; but never, I fear, the kindness which prompted your The bold eye of the Italian fell before the calm, steadfast look of the grateful girl, and he was at a loss for any reply. Hie had expected more embarrass ment in her manner, instead of this frank acknowledg ment of the favor he had done her. He saw nD repugnance in accepting what he considered a bol( move; but there she stood, calmly waiting for him t speak. After a thoughtful pause, he said,-   "FE AND A LONE.       163 "Let it never again be mentioned between us. I would do a service to any of-my pupils with the greatest pleasure." "But you will take my thanks, now," said Edith, " and something more substantial hereafter- will you not?" "Your thanks, certainly; but let the debt take care of itself." "I do not wish to' dismiss the subject so easily, signor; and, in the mean time, if I could only prove to you my constant remembrance of your goodness I " "What time do you practise the harp?" abruptly asked Gonsalvo. "I have now the hour from four to five, which is the exercise hour for the whole school but me. I go out later for a walk with one of the teachers." "Well, as you wish to show me favor for the slight one done you, it is in your power to do so. I had once a dearly loved sister; she was what we call in Italy an improvvisatrice: music was her passion, and the harp chosen of all instruments. It would be a ,melancholy, though very sweet pleasure to me, if you would allow me to be present sometimes during your practice hour. Mrs. Bertrand and the young ladies would probably consider this a very weak request from the Italian teacher -perhaps it is; and do not  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7083-00000082"/> 164 yLIEl AND AJB1UT. grant my request out of pity or gratitude, or if I should be the least interruption in the practice of your lesson." "None at all," replied Edith ; "the favor you ask is indeed small. Come whenever you care for music, though I must, in justice, tell you no person likes my singing ; but- I can learn the songs your sister knew, and perhaps give you some pleasure." , I shall draw largely upon your permission, and find it difficult to resist coming every day." ' Wait until you have heard me," laughed Edith. "I shall never expect to see you but once in the music hall." They separated. The wily Italian, with a glow of satisfaction on his face, sat down to ponder over the simplicity of girlhooad. Iis first idea had been, in S  h ho had initded to oin the d Edith make carrying out his purpose, to have had Edith make such rapid progress in German that she would have had to recite to him alone; but Clara Melville kept pace with her, and that was impossible. On some pretext or other he restored both girls to the regular class; and all had the benefit of the remarks with which he had intended to win the admiration of his genius scholar, and then her love; thinking that genius could only love the master power of its own tastes; forgetful or ignorant that the avenue to the   "FE AND ALONE.       165 heart of the most brilliant lies not always through a field of knowledge, that such a friend would be re- garded more as the book daily used, or a well-stored dictionary- good enough to refer to, but a dry mor- sel to love for life. The mind, though it may glory in the possession of knowledge, and find its chief happiness therein, wearied, does at times turn with envy to the careless ignorant, and find in their soci- ety relief from their own aching thoughts. In the solitude of her own chamber Clara Melville put to herself the question, Why was she thus struggling in the race of study with Edith Merton? Though her talents were of a high order, yet long hours of application could only accomplish what Edith's genius mastered at once. The stern monitor of the heart asked if her motive was to win back Irving, and every emotion responded, No. There was the strong desire to equal her who unwillingly had blasted her destiny for life to equal his new love. If it cost health and life, firm was her resolve to be at the next examination without a rival. Not from love of praise, but to stand alone in study, as was to be her destiny through life; and an uncontrollable impulse urged her to take Edith for a standard. A feeling had lately taken possession of her mind that she had never come. up to Irving's ideal, as Edith had; and now sho  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7083-00000083"/> 166       LIFE AND ALONE. wished to be worthy of the love which once had been offered her. The purity of her motives enabled her to ask God's blessing without a doubt. It might have been that the excitement and effort of study filled the void in her heart, were it not, when she lay down to rest, thoughts, chained no longer by the day's duties, rested calmly upon a higher hope than had ever brightened any earthly vision, and sought a love purer and dearer than the deepest tenderness one hu- man heart can give another. She who had known the wildest passion of an earthly love could rest in gentle peace, with her mind's eye lifted from the wreck, in faith, on scenes above. Put the question three months ago: 'What is the acme of all life's pleasures? and her whole heart's response would have been, Love. Ask it now, and every energy of her nature would have urged the glad answer, Love-- but of Christ, her Redeemer, not man. Thus we change, and the story of one is the history of thou- sands. One morning in the hall, Edith and Clara passed by one another; both stopped a moment, Edith to rest her impassioned gaze on the features so perfectly beautiful; and the thought passed quickly through her mind, Will she ever thus continue to grow more lovely? for it seems to me, each passing day develops some new expression of beauty. But   V an ANu AWONE.       167 Clara's eye rested on a sealed letter Edith carelessly held in her hand: it dropped; she picked it up for her, and recognized Irving's writing. The cold blood again fell drop by drop adown her heart, a dizziness rooted her to the spot; but Edith passed on uncon- scious. She was carrying her letter unopened back to the post-bag, to have it thus returned to Irving. In a few moments Clara Melville recovered her strength, but not so quickly from the thought her emotion had betrayed her into; and, in her room again, she exclaimed,- This feeling must be an agony of nature for its lost happiness, over which I can have no control. Thoughts, I can bid them go to sleep. Fears I can crush, and fill my being with the leaden weight of for- getfulness; but these strange spasms, this shrinking, and pressing round my heart cold drops of blood, taking almost my breath away, falling within me like ice bolts, - what mean they? Irving! No power can reach that instrument of torture which keeps alive the truth--we once have loved.  Say, if Edith's re- jection has such power over you, then are we united in suffering; " and she laughed long and wildly. That sound brought back her wandering senses, and the conviction of her weakness. Then followed the long probing of conscience, the new resolve, and,  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7083-00000084"/> 168      LXFE AND ALONE. at last, the restored peace of right endeavor. The tasks of the day seemed harder than usual; the strings of her harp vibrated less easily to her touch; she moved among her companions with a brighter look, joined their merriment with a louder laugh, than was her wont. She joined a group of girls of whom Kate Mellan was spokesman. "' Ah, Clara, you have had news from home: I see it in your eye, and that tell-tale blush upon your cheek reveals whom the letter is from; not Gerard, I am sure." The eye of the haughty beauty suddenly lost its lustre. She could ill brook, at any time, references to her personal matters, and her cheek paled to a -deathly hue; but she did conquer herself, and tho same sweet, fascinating smile played round her mouth, as she replied,- "There you are mistaken, Kate; my letter is from Gerard, and in it you are mentioned. Come and walk with me, and I will read you the part which re- fers to yourself." Nothing loath, Kitty Clover linked her arm within hers; and how could she divine having caused a wound? As a precious half hour went by, the two strolled up and down the terrace in front of the house, in kind, familiar chat. From her chamber   "FE AND ALONE.       16, window Edith Merton gazed out thoughtfully upol them, and murmured to herself,- "These, then, are the sweets of friendship I an never to know; for when School days shall have passed, will I not be too old, or powerless, to gain friends?

IT will be remembered that the exercise hour tor the school was from four to five in the afternoon; but Edith Merton was excused to practise the harp at that time. But few minutes of the hour passed before Gonsalvo would make his appearance, and, in silence, with a low bow, then take his seat near the instru- ment. At first Edith laughingly told him he had bet- ter wait until the last half of the hour, as she never practised but one song at a time, and then her singing would not have the tedious sound of learning; but he preferred to sit the hour through by her side, and dis- claimed that the repetition was tedious to his ears. Too engrossed in the occupation she loved so well, he was no interruption to Edith, and her eye never met the gaze he so passionately riveted on her face. If her mood was to improvise for the hour, then the un earthly music, added to her own conception for word, to accompany it, was well calculated to arouse th Italian to-a sense of his danger, and prove to hin   "FE AND ALONE.        I that at every interview his love was becoming a deep- er passion; and restraint was hard upon him. Upon the stage Edith would have realized a fortune. Gon- salvo had his eye upon that fact also. She would there have received all the applause which sometimes she wondered was never given to her now. Before a few individuals there was hardly time to recover from amazement, both at the music, the musician, and their own emotion. Singing before a crowd, the effect might have been the same ; but the expression of approbation which a theatre would warrant would have been given her in tumultuous applause, and relieved the oppressed feeling of the audience. The very restraint put upon one's delight in listening to her left an unpleasant im- pression, a sense of pain, a wearied, melancholy pleas- ure, a travelling back into the past of thought, or dim, uncertain glances thrown upon a lowering future. Gonsalvo saw in her the true element and poetry of all song, which could not fail to interest him in the girl of genius, who thus, by its power, gave glimpses as to her real life, embellished, of course, by constant cultivation, yet preserving a simplicity and originality her very own. Gonsalvo firmly believed in his own strength to restrain every expression of his love until it suited him to speak; but during one of these same practice-hours he lost all self-command : Edith's hands  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7083-00000086"/> 172       LIFE AND ALONE. were snatched from the harp, and on her bewildered ear fell a tale of strange and startling import. Her first thought was of his insanity, -that in his story to her of a sister, he had substituted that relation for some loved one who had died or disappointed him; and perhaps her singing had had an unhappy effect upon him in thus recalling the past. With deep sym- pathy she pressed his hands and turned towards him. The movement was misunderstood. The Italian's lips once more unsealed, and with all the fervor of his own beautiful language he gave expression to his love most powerful in words. . Edith looked and won- dered. It was to her more like some translation they had read together, than any scene of real life in which she was to bear a part. Then came the necessity of reply. Plainly and calmly she spoke of her surprise, how little in unison were her feelings with the sub- ject, and her hope that the hour might never be re- called to the memory of either. He was prepared for every objection, and begged her to defer all answer until school days were ended; said that he had been betrayed into this avowal of his feelings by the depth of his passion, but that he should not regret it if she would hold out to him some little hope for the future. His voice was low and entreating, his earnest eye fixed upon her with a mellowed light, and the more o   "FE AND A LONE.     1  3 quiet avowalof his love gave no indication of a wan- dering reason; and, unwilling as she was, Edith was forced to answer again. Her reply was, that every book she read would recall the kind teacher, and by that cherished name he should ever live in her memory; but that never, under any circumstances, would she allow him to hope to call her wife. Her words were few and simple, uttered with kindness and good will; and once more her hands swept the chords of her harp to end the interruption. Gonsalvo saw' there was no wavering in her decision: her self-possession was re- gained, and she seemed to have forgotten his pres- ence. This only added fuel to his fiery nature. This time he rudely snatched her hands from the harp, swore that she should listen to him yet another hour, and his strong clasp prevented her leaving the hall, while he exclaimed, - "Would you carry the tale to Mrs. Bertrand? Then add the truth. You have received presents, allowed for weeks my company here, and are now debtor to me for a large amount of money: these facts will reveal an intimacy the worthy lady would be slow to credit to your advantage, and render your whole story in her eyes a fabrication. Or, if you pre- fer, I will request an interview, and state the facts which our many pleasant hours, so privately spent, would tend to substantiate."  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7083-00000087"/> 1.74:      LIFE AND ALONE. The whole truth at once flashed upon Edith's mind. She had voluntarily put herself in the power of a vile man, and the net bore strongly the marks of her own spreading; and her character would be lost by the very. truths she would have to confess. Would he be- tray her? were the words almost trembling upon her lips. Then, spurning the fear, she poured out the full indignation of her soul to him:-- "You have dared to pollute my ears with your love, and enforce your baseness with a threat vile as the skill you employed to conceive it, and now you make it serve your purpose. 'Tis well that your character betrayed itself as soon as the avowal of your love, or I might have left you with a feeling of pity for the wound I unwittingly had caused. Now, if it be true you are wounded, may the knowledge of the contempt I feel for you keep the wound ever bleeding." Gonsalvo gazed upon the little fury he held in his arms, and, with new insult, goaded her on. With a strength almost supernatural, Edith sprang from him; but Gonsalvo placed himself by the door. The child before him was no weak antagonist in the war of words, so exasperated she became; till, angry in his turn by her free expressions of dislike, he made a last proposition, - either she should accept his love, or he would demand an interview with Mrs. Bertrand, tell   -"mat ANu ALONE.       1 the whole story, and present his bill of the loaned money for payment; and what would be the result for her? Edith could not understand the derisive scorn in which he now spoke-- this sudden change in his manner from pleading love to the ruin of her- self; and again the idea of his insanity flashed on her mind. Iter determination was being given in gentler terms, when the door opened, and Agnes Walters en- tered with a music-book under her arm. In their stormy interview both had forgotten the ight of time. Edith's hour had long since passed, and, if Miss Walters was punctual to her own time, she must have overheard the greater part of their conversation. Gonsalvo cast one look of contemptuous pity upon Edith, coolly bowed to Miss Waters, and departed. Edith waited but to hear the last echo of his footstep, and in silence  quitted the room. Her calmness re- stored, she seated herself in the quiet of her chamber to think over the present position of affairs. All that seemed possible for her to do was to pay the debt as soon as she could. Her diamond cross, she imagined, would bring more than the sum needed, and she did not hesitate one moment to part with it. She rang for a  servant, and immediately sent it to Gonsalvo. Early in the evening a  note came from him, which threw her anew into perplexity. It ran thus: "My  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7083-00000088"/> 1]6      LIFE AND ALONE. darling: The diamond cross shall be accepted as a peace-offering, and to be worn upon my heart as a pledge of your sincerity for the future. The love so tardily offered me is accepted with the deepest emo- tions of pleasure, and all which might wound forgot- ten ere you read this. Yours, as ever, GONSALVO." Edith had sent him the cross without a written line of explanation, thinking her object could not be mis- understood; and now his strange reply to her act filled her with uneasiness. The cross had evidently not been received as payment for his debt, and now was lost to her forever. What would be her fate if Gonsalvo exposed her to Mrs. Bertrand? To be ex- pelled from the school, and a lasting disgrace attached to her name. Long, long time she pondered; but her way grew no clearer, and the future was dark indeed. Clasping her hands, she exclaimed, - "This is the first time, my mother, when your pro- hibition to my forming any friendships has seemed less wise and less good for me. One little word from a person who really cared for me, one word of sym- pathy or to suggest something for me to do, would surely be a valuable kindness; but I have no one by the, name of friend. Clara Melville would help me. But no; such confidence would surely lead to, or be, intimacy. This trouble has brought me to the very   lIUEi AD ALOINE.     1 verge of sin. O, mother, if thy pure eyes have read mny soul, the thoughts of my heart have been to thee the sin committed, and a new grief is added to my burden. I'll banish the passing wish for sympathy, and henceforth and forever life and alone be mine." There was a gentle tap at -the door, and, without waiting for any answer, Agnes Walters entered. Edith started up. It was the, first time any scholar had sought her room, except when Clara Melville might have brought some message from Mrs. Bertrand, and she coldly asked a reason for the intrusion. "Your own good, I trust, Miss Merton. I came only to ask an explanation of the scene I witnessed in the music hall." "Who sent you here?" asked Edith. "No one; I came only from a sense of duty I have not mentioned a word to Mrs. Bertrand." "I was not  aware, Miss Walters, that listening was one of our duties; and I beg you to quit my room." "Then you refuse me any explanation." "Certainly, lMiss W alters; your curiosity must go unsatisfied.  t"Mrs. Bertrand may not be so easily put off, Diss lMerton. I came here first only as a friend, to offer " y sympathy, and to ask your confidence.

She turned to leave the room. "Stay," cried Edith. "Have you a father, mother brother, sister, friend? and can you deny me, wh have none of these, the poor privilege of keepin. in my own breast what concerns me alone? I scor to ask you not to carry your tale to Mrs. Bertrand but leave it to your own conscience if what was ol tained in so unworthy a manner will acquire mor virtue in communicating." "Your reply, Miss Merton, implies a consciousnes of guilt. ' "And your request, Miss Walters, if granted, woul be a violation of a dead parent's wish. Dare you urg me any more?" "I do not understand you; but I must say tha appearances are strongly against you. Even the rept tation of the school is at stake, and I would avert an; calamity in my power." Edith fixed her deep, sad eyes full upon her, ant replied, - "May your motive be as pure as your words im ply; and the pleasure of adding more wretchednes to a crushed spirit be as intense as the pain yot cause."

She must judge from its perusal how far he had been to blame, and her decision was law to him. Much more was said; and as Mrs. Bertrand deemed this a most manly avowal on the part of her Italian teacher, it served rather to elevate than debase him in her opin- ion. The lady again repaired to Edith's chamber; but from her all that could be obtained was, - "I can say nothing; 'tis being intimate." Mrs. Bertrand bade her give up any letters from Gonsalvo she might have in her possession, or be searched. Edith, indignant, handed the only one kept, the last received, which seemed to fully confirm the Italian's story; and she read her doom in Mrs. Ber- trand's eye, as twice she went through the note aloud. To the questions - Had she been in the habit of meet- ing Gonsalvo during her practice hours? had she re- ceived presents from him? had she borrowed money? -Edith simply answered   Yes. Mrs. Bertrand, firmly convinced of her guilt, and with a feeling of loathing she had never before experienced for any young lady committed to her charge, bade her remain   "E AND ALONE N I, xm)X.     181 in her room until the punishment was decided upon. The teacher little knew she had granted the child all of pleasure in her power to bestow; for Eith's only idea of peace and happiness was in the solitude of her own chamber.

" hat can you mean, Edith? You must speak, nd clear up your own character. It is assailed by a ad man. I know that you are perfectly innocent; ut Mrs. Bertrand thinks differently, and I have come o you, as a friend, to hear your story and prove to werybody that you are guiltless." "Miss Melville, if there is one word I hate above "others, which, if uttered, sends into the farthest distance a seraph's note, --the only music of my life, -that word is friend; a temptation to my spirit and a bane to all my thought. It ever places me upon the threshold of an awful doubt-whether I shall serve the living wish, or still enjoy the note of an angel's approbation; and this wavering I know is in part the sin committed." "But, Edith, the few words you spoke to Mrs. Bertrand only condemned yourself, when I know, if you would explain them, they would only serve as proofs of Gonsalvo's baseness. O, why will you not, when your own good name demands it?" "Dark indeed, Clara Melville, must be the spirit which can thus urge me to sin; and, if it is always beauty's dower, I'll mourn no longer for the charm I do not possess." "Edith, listen to me for a moment. I urge upon you a duty, no sin. You are placed here under Mrs.   JLJUL'^1 AlL AbUX      A Bertrand's entire control. She fills the place of parent to us all; from some mistaken motive you have refused her any explanation. Set aside my friendship as you please; but, in justice to yourself, give me what I demand, and I will set it all right with your teacher." "You are mistaken, Clara: if Mrs. Bertrand exer- cised the right you give her, she would bid me not to speak, either to you or to herself." "Why so, Edith? I do not understand you." "No, Miss Melville, you do not; and I thank you for those words." "The bell is ringing, Edith; Mrs. Bertrand will not permit me to stay a moment longer.   I have failed in what I came for. My sole wish was to serve you. I promised Mrs. Bertrand I would not urge a confession from you,'- merely ask for one;- and I do not dare to say all I want to. But rest as- sured, whatever be the consequences of your silence, I shall think you all that is good and pure, and in me you shall forever find a true friend both here and else- where.' "And I hope, Miss Melville, no temptation will ever so far overcome my strength to meet it that I should recognize you by that title. Sooner than be intimate with you, I would bear all the accumulated  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7083-00000092"/> "FE ; ALLY avJUW disgrace Gonsalvo could heap upon me-ay, more; even the loss of the beggar boy' s love." " Edith, I know you spurn my friendship, and I wish it was more worthy of your acceptance; but you have no power to prevent my warm love for your- self; and one word more of warning. Do you know you must suffer the severest punishment Mrs. Ber- trand can inflict? A public dismissal from the school -sent home in lasting disgrace; and all this from some mistaken motive of self-sacrifice. I know, as well as if you told me in so many words, that you are perfectly innocent; but you are ruined if l salvo's version of the affair be known. O0 Edith  will you not arouse your love of truth, and offer some- thing in your own defence ? Can you not see how necessary it is to save your reputation in this semi- nafy so far and so well known ? What can I do for you, if you will not help yourself?" " You are now assuming, Mliss Melville, the office of a friend, notwithstanding the plain terms in which I have disclaimed all interference in my behalf. In answer to your remarks, or anything further you can say on the subject, let me tell you, my silence shall be kept as long as the principle lasts which enjoins it upon me; and Heaven grant, when I forget the duty owed to thee, my mother, I may be asleep in the cold arms of death."   Perplexed and saddened, Clara left the room, more convinced than ever herself of the purity of Edith's character; but she knew that her own convictions could not sway the minds of other people. She easily understood how little improprieties, not known as such by the child, from the natural simplicity of her character, had favored some motive of Gonsalvo to do all in his power to injure her. She had also un- derstood from Mrs. Bertrand that Mrs. Merton wished her daughter to room alone, and diligently improve her time; but the extent of Edith's horror of being intimate with any one she did not in the least com- prehend, nor one half of the child's vague hints upon duty. In relating to Clara Gonsalvo's story, Mirs. Bertrand had remarked, - "But two opinions could be entertained upon the subject, -the one that he had told the truth, and de- scribed Edith exactly as she was; the other, that she might be insane, and not responsible for such despica- ble conduct." Remembering these words, Clara determined not to describe her interview with Edith. She would not cast such a blight upon the talented girl, -brand her witli insanity, because she was strange or peculiar, and not easily read. Still she had very little faith in the only alternative left her-to use her influence with  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7083-00000093"/> Mrs. Bertrand, and avert the impending punishment. At a former time the united entreaty of the school had not succeeded to prevent a scholar being expelled, and her fault was trivial in comparison with that of Edith; and besides, so strong was the feeling in school against Edith that many articles discovered just at this time to be missing were laid to her charge, and the whisperings amid many a group of girls branded her with the name of thief. Clara treated this with indignant silence; but almost every scholar refused to sign a petition that she should once more take her place among them. They assured Clara she was blinded by Edith's talents as to her real charac- ter; and, as the argument ran high, they went still farther, and loudly and openly condemned her inter- ference. Clara would not yield one iota of her asser- tions that Edith was innocent, and this was the cause of her own loss of popularity in the school. She who had walked queen of their number was now almost on a level with Edith, the disputing concerning her had grown so bitter. " Why,?' said the girls, " should Clara Melville pre- tend to deny guilt, when it has been acknowledged, just because the offender was a protegee of hers, and her pride must suffer in consequence? or why insist that Edith should go unpunished, when no forgiveness   has been asked for by the culprit herself, or even the humility of being sorry shown ? " Hard, indeed, was Clara Melville's position in the school; but two voices were silent upon the subject -Kate Mellan's and her cousin Ida's. Both had re- fused to sign the petition; yet did so without unkind remark. Agnes Walters was loud in her.detestation of Edith's conduct, and had so often repeated with embellishments her story concerning her that she suc- ceeded-to a sort of popularity in the school, -as the one who could give the most information upon the exciting topic. In the class every eye was fixed upon Gon- salvo, to see how he bore the loss of liis genius Scholar. No allusion was made to her but once, when he asked if a certain translation had ever been given; and Clara Melville answered promptly, that it was too difficult for the class; only Miss Merton had rendered it aright. The lesson through, Agnes Walters assem- bled her clique around her, and described in glowing terms the dark frown which had passed over the ex- pressive features of the Italian when Clara Melville had the boldness to mention Edith's name. " I think this must prove," continued Mliss Walters, "how thorough his contempt must be for her now; and 0, could you only have heard, as I did, the dis- dain with which he refused her plea to elope, and his  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7083-00000094"/> reason that it would bring such lasting disgrace upon the seminary, you would say, What a noble-minded man     ! I declare I am half in love with him myself." Clara was appealed to, to hear this new sentiment of Miss Walters; but she listened in contemptuous si- lence, with which was mingled a feeling of sadness, aris- ing from disappointment in all of her companions that they should seem so eager to hear and believe every word against Edith. Where was the generosity of character in those she had trusted and loved ? or even common goodness of heart, to feel so little sorrow for a fellow-scholar's disgrace ? Could it all spring from wounded pride, because Edith had taken so little no- tice of them ? and was this mean satisfaction their cruel revenge ?  Even Mrs. Bertrand's strong ex- pressions of dislike for her pupil Clara could not help thinking arose in some degree from prejudice, or she would see that there was a mystery in the whole affair; and she often acknowledged to herself how much dearer to her was Edith Merton alone in her chamber, bearing the opprobrium of all, than any one of those who had been her companions the last eight years at school-Edith, a comparative stranger, who had re- fused her friendship, and blasted the brightest hope of her life. Apart from' the other girls, -in fact, almost always now left to herself, - during an exercise hour,   Clara strolled, always thinking about Edith, analyzing her feelings with regard to her, and more and more convinced of the depth and unselfishness of her affec- tion for the strange girl who so unwittingly had wronged her; but ingenuity failed her to discover why first she was so drawn towards one who had so little attraction. It was easy to understand the pres- ent charm: Edith displayed so much talent, and they were rivals in the classes and final struggle for ex- amination prizes. Formerly no one had pretended to stand in competition with herself, and with a sweet humility - the true principle of moral grandeur - she bowed to a more brilliant mind. She loved to recall that hour of morning prayer, when, with the added awkwardness of a new comer, Edith stood before them all, and her heart went out with a mighty gush of sympathy and tenderness, never felt before in the same degree for any schoolmate. Mind called unto mind; hers alone gave response, and recognized its sister- genius. She remembered also that short, if bitter, had been the time when intense suffering had tarnished the pure recognition of a being more gifted than herself. It is hard to give up idols for any cause ; harder to see them taken and feel no hatred, to look calmly on pleasures left while the heart is crushed within; to go   &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7083-00000095"/> 190      LIFE AND ALONE. forward and meet the cloudy day, knowing there had been a time when the sun in its meridian glory shed light upon life's pathway. And thus had Clara Melville conquered envy, and--risen from despair, and from this very trial through Edith Merton -seized upon the golden promise whose perfection and fulness she shall realize to outweigh all of earth.   "FE AND ALONE.       191 CHAPTER     XI. THE time Mrs. Bertrand had allowed herself to dwell upon Edith's conduct had passed, and the day for her final decision came round. In a few hours this decision was to be made known to Edith, and Clara Melville, risking the loss of more than one per- fect recitation, begged first to have an interview with Mrs. Bertrand. The teacher hesitated to grant her request, it being study hours; but, finally, loath to re- fuse the favorite pupil anything, she was summoned to her private apartment. Few of the young ladies had ever entered this beautiful room, exclusively the retreat of the lady principal, and fitted up in a style of Oriental magnificence, well securing to her a very luxury of retirement. Clara entered the room with too heavy a heart to admire aught new or rare there, or even feel the compliment paid herself thus to meet Mrs. Bertrand as friend with friend. She entered at once on the subject uppermost in her thoughts. "I have little from Edith, my dear Mrs. Bertrand,  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7083-00000096"/> 192      LIFE AND ALONE. to plead in her favor, or any new reason to give you for my stronger belief that she is sinned against by Gonsalvo. Agnes Walters every day adds to her original story, which has created this strong feeling in the school against Edith, added to the envy felt for her superior talent. Until this late affair, who of us could compare with her in the performance of every duty, in a beautiful consistency of conduct, a quiet perseverance in study, and an observance of your slightest regulation, even those not strictly enjoined upon us? Let this, with her lonely, friendless situa- tion, her singular lot, plead in her behalf ere you make up your mind to expel her." "You must be aware, Clara, her fault can have no other treatment." "Then, Mrs. Bertrand, if your judgment decides that to be the punishment, can there be no mercy shown to a girl so young, and already crushed with a sorrow we are as ignorant of as of the true extent of her fault? It seems to me there could not be so sudden a fall from the perfect model to what you deem her." "Clara, do you know what you ask?  Where is your fair, impartial judgment? Totally obscured in a most romantic interest for an abandoned child. You would sacrifice the opinion of the whole school for ,    "FE AND ALONE.       193 her; and you insist upon it, giving for a reason only a vague idea why I should fail in the performance of my duty. What reason for my conduct could I give the teachers and the scholars, when the naked facts are as well known to them as to me? and this whole school, with the exception of yourself, is now waiting to see if I will yield to a weakness, or, strict in prin- ciple, act out my duty. Shall I tell them I pity Edith Merton-the worst case which has ever come under my observation? Shall I tell them I pardon her be- cause Clara Melville, the nobleman's daughter, the favorite pupil, asks it of me? fow absurd The strict discipline we pretend to here must be carried out, or we impose on the public, and lose a reputation which has never been assailed. Would it not be really one of my greatest pleasures to grant any re- quest made by you? Yet we are pledged here to allow ourselves no such gratification; your persist- ence only adds much to my sorrow, and makes still harder the course I am compelled to take, without being of the slightest advantage to Edith." "But I believe her to be innocent, Mrs. Bertrand." "What of that? Have you been here so long, and now find it difficult to acquiesce in my more ma- tured judgment?  We must have no more words about pardon until you can give sufficient reasons to 13  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7083-00000097"/> 194       LIFE AND ALONE. excite in my mind a doubt of Edith's guilt. If you can bring forward such, I will hear." "I think," said Clara, slowly, " some idea of duty, unappreciated by us, restrains Edith from making a full confession, and thus proving herself innocent." "And- yet, Clara, you must allow there is, under ex- isting circumstances, a higher duty owed to me, her teacher, whom she should be made to obey. She is not at an age to mark out a course of conduct, and pursue it, independent of those under whose care parental authority has placed her; but even her parent's influence ceases here, if it clash with any rule of mine." "I think, perhaps, Mrs. Bertrand, her idea of duty may be of a religious nature, and she would set that claim above yours." "I think I understand you; but her religion should teach her this very obedience to me. I have com- manded her to tell her own story; she persists in refusal, and I somewhat fear, Clara, that even your ideas of right and wrong are clouded in the mystery you are pleased to fling around this wayward girl, whose only strangeness that I see is a desire - un- like most young persons - to shut herself up within herself, and devote all her time to study. This is un- common, I will grant, but savors very little of mys-   "FE AND ALONE.  tery. Were Gonsalvo false, he would hardly have sought my advice in the matter, and so frankly told' -every little circumstance of their intercourse; and if Edith was in want of on   o Edith was in want of money, would it not have been more natural to apply to me or to you for some than to Gonsalvo?" "I should think, Mrs. Bertrand, that might be a plot on his part to entrap her." "Very well; what do you make of the gift of the cross, which the letter in her possession explains, and fully condemns her; besides that strong desire she manifested to have that particular hour for practiing assigned her, when all of you were gone out, and her obstinate silence prove to me her inability to say one word in her own  defence. For the last time I put the question to you, Clara, which shall govern me ,- these facts or your conjectures? ", "I can only say, Mrs. Bertrand, I wish you thought as I  do." "Very well; Edith and the school also must now be told of her punishment; but this I will grant lot that there is any doubt of her guilt in my m ind, 'ut on your account solely: there are several weeks ret remaining of the term;  if, using discreet means, OU can give me reason to think I  may possibly be taken, I promise you to defer her expulsion from 'hool until the end of the year."  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7083-00000098"/> 196       LIFE AND ALONE. Clara eagerly thanked her for that little conces- sion, but felt she had another favor to ask; viz., that Edith or the school should not be informed at present what was to be her punishment. Perhaps the teacher divined her request; for sheogently but firmly termi- nated the interview, and went directly to Edith's room. On entering, Edith cast upon her a look full of anx- ious inquiry, as if she understood the purport of her coming, but said nothing. "I have waited thus long," began Mrs. Bertrand, coolly, " with the hope you might clear yourself of at least some of the charges brought against you, or offer excuse which might palliate your guilt; but my waiting has been in vain. You have chosen to keep silence, which of course is a tacit confession of guilt, and I am compelled to pursue the usual course for misconduct deemed sufficient for severe measures. You appear too hardened to receive benefit from any remarks I could make upon your fault, and too bereft, of delicacy to appreciate them. It only remains for me to say that you will be publicly dismissed from the seminary on the next examination, the explana- tory report read aloud by one of the committee, and their reproof given you. Until that time, continue your lessons as usual, and with your class pass an ex- -anination, .where, I have no doubt, you will do your-   "FE AND ALONE.       197 self much credit; and I grieve that it is my duty to destroy the results of your diligence. At the en- treaty of Clara Melville, I have promised to receive, however tardy, a confession from you, and, if I deem it expedient, change the mode of your punishment. I trust she may not be disappointed in the hope you will give one." Edith raised her eyes, and fixed a deep, earnest gaze upon the stern face of her teacher, then, in a low, mild voice, spoke: - "That confession would require a degree of confi- dence not allowed me to give; nor have I gone thus far to fail at the most tlying moment." She ceased, 'and Mrs. Bertrand continued,  "I have but little more to add, except that your position in school is changed; and I fear no efforts of mine can prevent your punishment commencing from   the time you come among     us again. You will suffer in the altered manner of your companions; by humiliation in the presence of Gonsalvo; in the contempt which you will read on the face of every teacher. The way of sin is always hard, save unto those whose conscience is seared, which God forbid, thus early in life, should be your "fate; and may He grant that a speedy repent  - ance save you from so dreadful a future.  To  con. science and reflection I leave you now."   &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7083-00000099"/> 198      LIFE AND ALONE. "Stay one moment more," exclaimed Edith, impet- uously; and she rose and flung herself upon her knees before her. "If I beg and implore you to de- vise some other mode of punishment than expelling me from the school, think not I fear disgrace in the eyes of those who may be present. Teachers, guests, or scholars, are nothing to me; in their approbation or scorn I discern no difference; but listen, and be moved to pity when I tell you. For the sake of one upon whom every hope is built, who has been the one thought to relieve the anguish of my solitude- change the punishment. Let it be bread and water, years' confinement- anything; but brand me not with this disgrace. Doom me not to the full realiza- tion of the words life and alone I - to be hated where I have been loved. The only voice which ever uttered 'Edith' in love and hope you will banish from my side forever." Astonished at the manner in one so calm and pas- sionless, and at such words, Mrs. Bertrand could only think she referred to Gonsalvo; and her answer was in accordance with that thought. With a gesture of proud impatience Edith arose, and waving her hand towards the door, exclaimed, - "It is enough; you have not understood me. I see again the justice of my mother's prohibition. I   AIFi ANUL ALUJNiE,     19 pray God to give me strength to bear, when the time shall come, the disgrace you have decided for me." Mrs. Bertrand lingered with the hope of hearing more; but the suppliant had changed her manner to one of proud indifference, and she stood before her teacher with that calm, deep look, so hard to read, until Mrs. Bertrand asked if she had nothing more to say. "Let me not detain you another moment upon my own account," answered Edith, still keeping her eyes fixed upon the puzzled woman. As they stood face to face, the power seemed to be in the young girl, and the woman undecided, shrinking from a something she knew not what. Edith's gaze fascinated her to the spot, till by an effort she regained the cold dignity with which she had entered the room ; and she turned to go out, saying,  "Let your lesson's be prepared for to-morrow as usual. I will send Clara in time to show you where they are." She was gone. Did she hear that sound of strange laughter as she passed along to her room? I trow not; or again she would have paused upon her late decision, and waited long ere she blasted the reputa- tion of a young girl whose peculiarities in some way she had failed to comprehend. "The deed is done," thought Edith aloud. "The  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7083-00000100"/> 200       LIFE A1ND ALOUNJ. printed report will give the beggar boy intelligence like this: 'Edith Merton, expelled from Mrs. Ber- trand's far-famed Seminary for disgraceful intercourse with an Italian teacher,' and on page after page his eye may scan the details. And I have now no cher- ished thought to fall back upon. Henceforth reverie will be a burden; to think, the curse of life." She pressed her hand upon her brain. "Ay, let to-day be marked by life's farewell of the beggar boy. If he has earned the name he sought, he would not tarnish it by a union with disgrace. The cross, too! 'tis gone! WAhat pain is this which forbids me to say farewell to him? Do I fear to hear the echo of his soul's response? Ha I ha I The sound comes travel- ling on; let it break into my heart; but, mother, re- member your note must be louder to fill the void there. Come back, strength of mind; enable me to look calmly upon life's anguish. Hush, every emo- tion, while I bid adieu to what has gilded life for me. Love is to take its departure, that life may be alone. O, let it not linger upon the shadow of a hope that she may relent; for the awful disappointment might not find me as strong to bear even as now. Is it true we create the one half of sorrow by the view we take of it? Then cold as one dead, firm with the strength despair alone gives, I sever the past from the. present and its future. I resign what the beggar   "I'Ey AND ALONE.      201 boy called his claimi, and bid the remembered tone of his voice go out from memory forever. We are parted, we are parted! 'Twas not, but 'tis now life and alone, the revelation of fate." She flung both hands wildly over her head, smote her breast as if to stifle feeling, then pressed her brow as if to ease some acute pain there. Then fol- lowed that unusual sound from her-a long, loud laugh: the noise partially recalled her to herself, but her head began to grow dizzy. The room swam around her, and darkness, black as night, bound every sense. At this moment Clara Melville knocked, and receiving no answer, gently opened the door, and said, - "I have come to show you where to-morrow's les- sons are." Her eye fell upon Edith as she lay stretched out upon the floor stiff and cold. "I expected as much," exclaimed the noble-hearted girl, as with al- most supernatural strength she raised the stricken form, and laid it on the bed; but nothing she could do brought back animation; and when the physician sent- for had come, he could not account for such a sudden and complete suspension of the laws of Na- ture. He gave as his opinion that fever, and perhaps delirium for days, would follow her awakening. The most powerful remedies alone restored the faintest  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7083-00000101"/> 202       LIFE AND ALONE. appearance of life, and in voiceless' anxiety Mrs. Ber- trand, the doctor, and Clara Melville bent over the prostrate girl. On opening her eyes, they first en- countered the sight of Mrs. Bertrand, and horrible con- vulsions followed. Then inanimate as before she lay. This happening the second time, the doctor advised Mrs. Bertrand to leave the room and Miss Melville remain alone with him. If her presence had a simi- lar effect on the patient, a strange nurse could be ob- tained. He would not answer for another attack, and could hardly doubt this last would be fatal to mind or body. The time she lay insensible was longer than before, and the wild light of her eye, when she did revive, showed plainly the doctor had surmised the truth --her reason was gone. At sight of Clara, she sweetly smiled, and murmured,- ' My mother " The doctor bade Clara favor the delusion, as it might aid in soothing her. It was now very necessary to produce sleep, and, until that was done, every moment would but increase her danger. He left a powerful medicine for that purpose, and said he -would come again early in the morning. The wild eyes of the sick girl followed Clara as she moved about the room, making some few arrangements for the night; then suddenly springing up in bed, she exclaimed, in a frightened tone, -   "FE AND ALONE.       200 "Lock the door, mother dear; turn the daylight out; come here close to my bedside, for I have some- thing to tell you. How beautiful you look I It seems to me you are not so cold and stern as when we parted upon earth. How much immortality has improved you! "{ But, Edith, darling, you must try and sleep, that you may be well in the morning.' "Who is here? Who called me ' darling'?  Is it you, mother? You never called me that before. I will go to sleep after I have talked with you; I can- not before." Clara could not stem the torrent of her words, and, seating herself on the side of the bed, was obliged to listen to her incessant talk all the night through. It was a solemn scene--the young girl alone with madness, learning through its ravings the mysteries of another's heart. Edith began with, - "One thing' you must know first, mother dear: I have faithfully kept your commands, and been inti- mate with no one--not even with-Clara Melville, when she could have saved me from all suffering, too. I only looked on her beauty, though I could not help knowing how good she is. I have tried not to love her, and I have never been intimate with her--not even when she urged me to; because I knew you were looking down upon me, and I did not speak one word to clear myself.  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7083-00000102"/> 204'      LIFE AND ALONE. "I must be quick. I see a light spreading; I sup- pose we shall grow bright together now. Let me feel your hand; it is hot yet. But wait until you hear about Gonsalvo. He sent me some books. I told him I had no money to 'pay for them; and he said they were a present, because I studied well. I was dread- ful poor, and he loaned me money. I did not ask him, but he would not take it back. The letter is in the fire; just look -no, don't leave me. I sent him my cross to pay the debt, and he wrote me such a note, - as if I' had made him a present, - and Mrs. Bertrand stole it. I did not tell her a word; was not a bit intimate with her. Gonsalvo asked me if he might come into the room while I played the harp, because his only sister loved music, and died. I told him, yes. He used always to come; but one day he grew dreadful angry, because I did not love him, and told him so. Let me think; that was the day he swore, and said he would hate me if I did not love him, and tell Mrs. Bertrand that I .owed him money. Agnes Walters stood listening at the door, but I was not intimate with her, and she told falsehoods about me, and so did Gonsalvo; but I did not speak, nor even ask them not to. "They are going to expel me the next examina- tion. O, if I dared to tell you one thing I But   "FE AND ALONE.       205 you told me never to mention the subject again. But, mother, dear, it is so long since we have talked together, and you look so kind, - and angels never are angry, you know, -I think I will: I saw the beggar boy the next day, loved'him dearly, found out where his home was ; but you were in the cottage, and I was afraid to go in; but here in heaven, of course, I have no such thing as fear. The beggar' boy is to hear all about me, and he will despise me; so you see, mother dear, I never can mention the subject again." Clara sat and listened in silence. There 'was too much connection for her to disbelieve one word. All which- had seemed mysterious in Edith's conduct was unravelled to her that night, and she laid by in her heart every word that was spoken to carry out a pur- pose conceived during her long vigil. Edith simply related every circumstance which had happened to her, from the time of her leaving home, to one by her bedside whom she fancied to, be her mother. She told of her school days, of her visit to Clara, at Lady Glenville's, of Irving's avowal of love, of .Gerard's also. Clara shrank instinctively from the harsh terms with which she spoke of Irving, and the description of Gerard's courtship would have provoked a smile at any other time.  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7083-00000103"/> 206       LIFE AND ALONE. Towards morning Edith's talk was more of wild rambling. Her fever had increased to an alarming degree, and with a feeling of relief Clara saw the doc- tor come in. -She read in his face the disappointment that his medicine had not taken effect; and he con- fessed he should have very little hope for her if sleep was not produced, and that speedily. Day and night passed again without Edith's closing her eyes, and her raving now was at the height of madness. Clara alone had power to quiet her even in the slightest de- gree. She stood or sat beside her in tireless watch- ing, soothing, entreating, or commanding, in turn. For an hour at a time Edith would sing, but it was in the low, broken tone of weariness, without tune or meaning - a dirge-like moaning. The physician, with all his anxiety for his patient, could not help noticing with admiration the beautiful girl who had stationed herself as nurse, and showed such unwearied devotion. He had learned from his own daughter, who was a day scholar at Mrs. Bertrand's, that the two whom he daily saw were rivals for the same prizes at the approaching examination, also the cause of Edith's sickness, and of this one friend who maintained her innocence at the loss of her own popularity in the school, and thus nursed her at the loss of time most valuable to herself at present. All this his daughter   "FE AND ALONE.       207 had told him under strict secrecy,. as Mrs. Bertrand did not allow school matters spoken of out of the building. The teacher herself had not been permitted to enter Edith's room again. She had informed the school what was to be her punishment, gave that as a reason for her sudden sickness; and the daily rou- tine-of study went on as usual, as if the angel of death was not nearing one of their number. At length the doctor informed Mrs. Bertrand that one more day of wakefulness and delirium would decide Edith's fate; o and a rumor went through the school, brought by his daughter, that Edith Merton could not live. The solemn look on Mrs. Bertrand's face, as she took her place among them, seemed to confirm the report. It was strange to mark in some the revulsion of feeling towards the sick girl, the frightened air with which others heard the intelligence. Agnes Walters espe- cially was shunned as if in some degree the cause of Edith's sufferings, and once more Clara Melville was mentioned in tierms of love and respect. "There is one thing," said Kate Mellan, as she stood amid a group of girls, all commenting upon the sad theme - " if Edith Merton dies, Clara will have nothing to reproach herself with; for she has fought her battle bravely, and stood by her to the last." "You mean that as a taunt upon me," answered Agnes Walters.  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7083-00000104"/> 208       LIFE AND ALONE, "Take as much as you please of it; I do my part. Your story has grown quite tragic since it was first told; but if your motive was pure, I suppose you did right in telling it. I am glad it was not I, however." Agnes Walters rather shrank away; for she knew that a mean jealousy had prompted her, and she now felt her first sting of remorse. As an hour which the physician had cause to fear drew near, he looked at Clara, and seeing the change which constant watching had made in her looks, he determined she should not be present. "Come, Miss Melville," said he, "we shall have you in a like condition soon; go into another room, and take some rest. I will remain here through the night, and summon you if necessary." Clara pleaded hard to be allowed to stay, but to no purpose. The doctor was firm, and she withdrew to her own apartment. There, alone, she felt she had another duty to perform ere thinking of rest; and, seating herself at a desk, she wrote out Edith's con- fession. This she placed with some unfilled checks near her bed, where she might see them the very mo- ment she should open her eyes; and trying to impress upon her mind that she must awake by four o'clock, she lay down for the much needed rest. The doctor had forced Edith to be quiet; she had soon missed   "FE - AND ALNE.       209 Clara, and began calling for her mother, until through fear she was silenced. The doctor made a last trial, of his skill in administering medicine, and then sat down by her bedside, anxiously watching. At first Edith glared her eyes upon him, then she grad- ually closed them, and at last was in a profound sleep. Gentle beads of perspiration gathered upon her brow, and now the faithful physician could hope everything. He thought of the joyful tidings which awaited the young nurse on the morrow, and felt that never is a long practice had it been for him to bestow more of pleasure; and morning did but confirm his hopes.

"ONG before any person was stirring in the house, or had greeted the new day even in wakened thoughts, Clara Melville rose, dressed, threw over her shoulders a light scarf, thickly veiled her face, and softly stepped through the long halls until she reached an outside door. With difficulty she turned the ponder- ous key,tdrew the bolt, and passed out into the street. She took the way leading to Gonsalvo's boarding- house. During the past night a heavy rain had fallen, and the ground was cold and damp. Large threaten- ing clouds were slowly gathering blacker, and the mist was like rain; but Clara heeded not the chills passing through her frame. She knew Gonsalvo's habit of early rising,!and had no doubt but in person he would admit her. She was right in her surmise, and in perfect amazement Gonsalvo asked what was wanted. "Yourself," was Clara's reply; "lead the way to your own parlor; my business is with you alone."   "FE AND ALONE.       2" "For what has Miss Melville honored me with this early call? Does she fear neither wind nor rain for her beauty, that she braves such a morning as this?" "I have honored you, as you term it, to afford you the opportunity to honor yourself by making the only reparation in your power for the most disgraceful act which ever tarnished the honor of a man." "Your language, fair lady, is as startling as your beauty; but what means this play?- tragic or comic?" "A tragedy, I should say, sir, if the event this morning be what last night warned us to fear; but no play upon words takes away the solemn truth that Edith Merton's death lies at your door. I have come hither to obtain your signature to this true con- fession of hers, drawn up by my own hand." "Comio! Miss Melville, let me remind you that Mrs. Bertrand is head of this establishment, and would hardly approve this unbecoming effort of yours; though a call from you at any hour would afford me infinite delight." "And let me remind you, sir, you are hot speaking to the friendless Edith Merton, but to Lord Melville's daughter, who will hardly allow one to insult her with impunity; so beware, sir, of your looks, words, and manner. I first would give you the satisfaction of an  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7083-00000106"/> 212 1      LIFE AND ALONE. appeal to your better nature: should that fail, I leave you not until by some other means my- object be gained." "I have in prospect a companion for a long time; but say on, fair lady. I like to see human nature in all its phases." "I do not, sir; and I have little fear Mrs. Bertrand would require your signature ere believing this paper, but I would afford you this little reparation in your power to make. I see you refuse it-: now at what sum of money may I buy justice of you?" "Ah, Miss Clara, that sounds more-business-like, which I should never have given your refinement credit for. While you pull that string, your object may be gained, if not held too tight; if so, it will come to nought." Clara's refinement did suffer; but for Edith's sake she conquered her disgust, and went on:- "Provided you sign this paper, and hand me the diamond cross, I will make up your salary for the rest of the year, pay for the books, and refund the money you forced upon Miss Merton's acceptance." !"You are too exact in your calculations, Miss Mel- ville; but I could not part with the cross at so cheap a rate. You must be aware the diamonds would bring more in the city."  ) /   "FE AND ALONE.       213 "I make no other offer, sir; and as to the recovery of the diamond cross, if I fail, it is a matter where Lord Melville may have better success." "Perhaps you would not wish to expose your friend by referring the matter to your father," said Gonsalvo, insolently. Clara saw at once he had her at an advantage, and she haughtily replied, - "I care less to exchange words with you. Name the sum." Gonsalvo leisurely took the cross from his pocket, counted the stones, and named its full value. Clara hastily filled out a check for the amount; and, in return for his signature on her paper and the cross safe in her keeping, handed him the check; and with- out deigning further notice turned to leave the room, when Gonsalvo exclaimed, - "One word more upon this business." "Lord Melville's daughter," answered Clara, with- out looking round, " has gained her object in coming here, and she would hardly condescend to tarry even to express her deep contempt for your baseness." She was gone; and before noon the same day Gon- salvo received his dismissal from Mrs. Bertrand. It came to her knowledge long afterwards, that Gonsalvo had some personal acquaintance with Mr. Merton, knew of a large amount of property which on Mrs.  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7083-00000107"/> 214       LIFE AND ALONE, Merton's death fell to her daughter, and that the vil- lain imagined from Edith's isolated position and her own peculiarities he could attach her to himself, or so abuse her simplicity as to serve his own project. This, and a long-remembered wrong in which the name of Merton was closely connected, was his sole motive in offering himself as teacher in Mrs. Ber-. trand's seminary. From the physician he had learned Edith could not possibly recover, and hence his will- ingness to cloe so quickly with Clara's proposals. Clara went direct to Mrs. Bertrand's apartments, not even stopping to make inquiries at Edith's door -so fearful was she of the tidings which might be given her. Mrs. Bertrand admitted her at once, and Clara put into her hands the paper, pointing to Gonsalvo's signature.- She made no mention of how obtained or of the cross, merely holding it up to view. Mrs. Bertrand read the confession carefully through, and in a moved voice exclaimed, -- "This perseverance is worthy of you, Clara; and your reward will be, not only in the reestablished inno- cence of Edith, but in the glad news I have to im- part. She has slept the night through quietly, is asleep now, and the doctor is greatly encouraged.. He thinks it best a stranger nurse should be procured now; and your constant attendance will be hardly in   "FE AND ALONE.       '215 accordance with Edith's views. Now that we know the beautiful truth of her character, what you termed an aversion to yourself will be rightly understood. We will unitedly respect her strict observance of her mother s wishes, and never trespass on that sacred ground, though we may well love this uncommon example of a living sacrifice on the altar of duty. While I recognize this promise, which has taken such deep hold upon her imagination, I shall try and con- vince her to what extent it is binding, and redeem my past ignorance of her real worth by efforts to win her confidence. You, Clara, have acted nobly, and have no sad thoughts to fall back on." The young girl slightly trembled, but made no answer, and Mrs. Ber- trand continued:-- "Edith's sufferings have made her very dear to me, and taught a lesson I shall not soon forget. In fancied wisdom, I thought I read easily the characters of all my pupils; in future I'll remember I may be mistaken, as in this instance. This paper must be read before the school, and then henceforward and forever the name of Gonsalvo be an interdicted word. I know, my dear Clara, you neither expect nor wish thanks from  Edith for what you have done': the knowledge of your devoted friendship would occasion her only pain,; but the time will come when this kind-  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7083-00000108"/> 216       LIFE AND ALONE. ness will be fully appreciated, when this ban upon her school days will be taken off. And now, when she awakes, go to her, and say she is proved innocent; that my sentence is reversed; and with what heart-felt joy I retain her as an ornament to this school." A few hours later Clara entered Edith's apartment. She found her awake and very weak; but the unnat- ural light of her eye was gone, and she inquired, with her old formal manner, what was wanted. Coldly as she could speak, Clara delivered Mrs. Bertrand's mes- sage, and added that Gonsalvo was dismissed. "I think I shall get well now," replied Edith, in a very low tone, " and in a few days trouble you once more to tell me where the lessons are. I will send for you when I feel able to study; but now I want to be left alone with this kind nurse, who is trying to make me so comfortable; " and her eye rested with expressive gratitude upon a stranger woman, who that morning had been brought there to attend on her wants. Clara left the room without feeling the slightest pang of disappointment at her reception, admiring - if it were possible - still more the consistency of character, changed only when the mind had lost its long-forced sway. At the same time she gave Mrs. Bertrand's message,- Clara had handed her the cross,   "FE AND ALONE.       21 saying that their teacher had received money for her, Gonsalvo's debt was paid, and any amount she wanted she had only to ask Mrs. Bertrand for, and state the purpose for which it was needed. Edith gave no an- swer to this. Clara could now think upon Edith's position in school with the greatest pleasure. She would take her place in the affections of Mrs. Ber- trand, and the words heard in the hour of delirium, "O, mother, had you known Clara, you would have made an exception of her," repaid her for every act of kindness.  With new  interest and zeal she now resumed her books to make up for lost study hours. Gonsalvo's place was filled by a female teacher, and though no pupil dared murmur, yet in their lessons they missed the master mind which was accustomed to dwell with so much force and beauty upon the fine passages, and by the charm of treasured knowledge recall so many interesting facts in connection with their translations. Miss Serle was overheard by one of the teachers, one day, to declare that, now Gonsal- vo was gone, the lessons were a mere humbug; she merely held a book in her hand, and that their present Italian teacher seemed rapt in a like contemplation of calf-skin, as for all the information she ever im- parted. "You may add," exclaimed Agnes Walters, " she  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7083-00000109"/> 218       LIFE AND ALONE. reminds one of that docile animal. There is a strong resemblance as to face, and her ' Comince ' moo'd out in broken English, may be the Italian for cow, for all we learn of her- stupid thing! Both of the young ladies, by reproof freely admin- istered, had cause to remember their wit a long time ; but the poor teacher from that day never wanted a cognomen. "Calf " she was dubbed in every form of pronunciation. Mrs. Bertrand was true to her word. The days of Edithls convalescence she passed as much as possible with her, and endeavored to remove the impression that her mother's prohibition had extended to her teacher. Edith replied that she only remembered one remark as referring to teachers, from which she could not so plainly see her duty, but had little doubt both were included. Mrs. Bertrand continued her labor of love, notwithstanding the effects were impercepti- ble. Edith gave her the same cold, cheerless answers, and never greeted her entrance with a smile. Re- turning strength brought back the consciousness she might still retain the pleasing theme for thought,- the beggar boy, - and with joy indeed she took her old seat beside the open closet door, flat upon the floor, and indulged in reverie. This she did the first hour her strength permitted. What the effect on an   "FE AND ALONE.       219 invalid confined for weeks in a darkened chamber, a pleasing landscape looked upon from the window, or the sun of a bright morning shining in, might be- such was to Edith this old habit of thinking resumed. Nature's many-toned voice of gladness would not send more of rapture through an invalid's heart than the restored memory of the beggar boy did through Edith's. Soon her recovery was complete, and les- sons were again the order of the day. After her first reappearance in the class, some girls grouped together for conversation, or what might more properly be termed fun; one of them remarked, - "Petrarch's Laura has come among us again." "Happy thought!" exclaimed Miss Bell; " we now have a name to keep alive in our minds that piece of elegance whose own we are forbidden on pain of ban- ishment to speak.  For the future let him be to us all a Petrarch." "What are you conversing about, young ladies? ' asked Mrs. Bertrand, as she passed through the room. "Of the force of passion," promptly answered Agnes Walters ; " that the least display of temper is unlady-like." "Girls, did you ever hear before that Petrarch was unlady-like?"  asked Kitty Clover, laughing; "but come, ye daughters of Italy; there is the bell, and the  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7083-00000110"/> 220       LIFE AND ALONE. fair Laura must not imagine we trespass on her story." With rather less dignity than usual the Italian class took their respective places. "You may commence, Miss Eldred," said the teacher. "I do not know where the exercise begins, sig- nora." "How, then, have you not prepared any lesson?" "I wrote a double portion yesterday." "Miss Serle, will you name the line?" "It begins with, 'Now, when the golden calf was formed.'" A half-suppressed titter went through the class, and Miss Bell whispered to her next neigh- bor, - "Only think, L'Erche has had her miniature taken." A reproof was given for the laughing and whisper- ing, which was Signora L'Erche's first attempt at rep- rimand, and the lofty feeling young ladies considered themselves -greatly insulted. After their recitation they spared her no ridicule, and agreed no better suc- cessor for the beloved Petrarchl could have been found. "Hush!" said one; " why stir the ashes in the urn, when Laura looks him absent?" and Edith drew near them, saying, - "You have my book, I believe."   "FE AND ALONE.       221 "I beg your pardon, Miss Merton; will you be kind enough to read this difficult passage for us?" "I will read it to you," said Clara Melville, coming to Edith's relief; and the passage asked to be ren- dered was one of the most burning strains of passion- ate love by the Italian poet to his Laura. What was intended for a careless joke entranced them all, while listening to Clara's beautiful translation. Even Edith stopped, gazed upon the reader, and thought, - "I could not have done the lines half the justice." Clara could have told her the reason was, because she had never loved and been rejected. It was the effort made to conquer feeling which had lent such pathos to her voice, and made her words flow like in- spiration. Kate Mellan carelessly remarked, - "I declare, Clara, one must be in love to read as well as you." To the surprise of all, Edith answered for her: -- "Yes; in love with the author, with the language, and with the beautiful." "And not the kind of love," said Miss Serle, "with which brothers woo their sisters' friends." "Girls," exclaimed Ida Glenville, bursting into the room, " here is a regular old gypsy fortune-teller in the south hall; nobody in the room excepting Sig- nora L'Erch6, who is expiring over a novel. Who'll- come?"  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7083-00000111"/> 222       LIFE AND ALONE. "Which is it - man or woman?" "I don't know. It is a shilling apiece to have anything told. Come, Clover, I know. that you want to have your fortune told. Better ask Clara, Kitty; she may tell it to you without a shilling." "Stop, girls," exclaimed Clara, earnestly, " and you, Ida Glenville. Mrs. Bertrand would not ap- prove your having anything to do with so absurd a personage; besides, our own sense should pre. vent it." "We have not all your wisdom," answered Miss Bell; "the amusement is perfectly harmless, and gives us a new insight into human nature. The study of our species is very desirable, and I, for one, will go." A dozen followed, and each, with shilling in hand, pressed near the gypsy. The answer given their questions was ambiguous, therefore satisfactory and pleasing. Edith, from curiosity to see a live gypsy, was of the number; but the crowd round him pre- vented her catching one glimpse. "I should like to have my fortune told," she ex- claimed, and they made way for her. The moment her eye fell upon the seer, she screamed out,- "Why, 'tis Gonsalvo I " The scream called Signora L'Erche from her book,   -    LIFE AND ALONE.       223 with which she was seated in one of the deep embra- sures of the windows; and such a stream of Italian $ followed her approach there seemed to be some other recognition going on.  Clara Melville joined the ! group, and in a few moments understood perfectly the conversation. The lady teacher was claiming her husband. Quietly Clara withdrew, and informed Mrs. Bertrand of the scene, whose effectual measures soon drove away the principal actors. Mrs. Bertrand thought the two could not be acting in concert, but that Gonsalvo's object was still Edith; and Clara said he came to ascertain if she were living, for she re- membered telling him that no hope was entertained of her recovery. lMiss Serle could not refrain her sarcasm in talking over the matter with her clique. "They say that love is blind; but in this instance it penetrated quite a disguise." I Soon there was little time left for gossip; all were preparing for the near examination. It was a prac- tice of .iany to waste the first half of the term, and towards its close put forth every energy to meet the trial of scholarship; and a boldness in answering questions often served for months of labor. To each class there was-one prize allotted, and as this was to be Clara Melville's last appearance in school, she felt a corresponding anxiety to gain it. Something within  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7083-00000112"/> 224       LIFE AND ALONE. told her she would fail. The unaccountable spasms had returned oftener of late, and a cough from the memorable morning she had paid Gonsalvo a visit kept her awake nights. That Irving would be present was another thought little calculated to allay her fears or add to her self-possession on the occasion. She was pretty sure Edith was the only rival, however, she had to fear, and the time lost by. both was pretty nearly equal. Edith never gave the subject one mo- ment's thought, as far as' extra study or anxiety was concerned; but she had thoughts and intentions which she kept to herself.   "FE AND ALONE.        225 CHAPTE-R    XIII. UPON the floor, beside the open closet door, sat Edith Merton the morning of examination day; and her reverie was a sort, of commune with herself in ex- pression such as follows: - "Surely it is not being intimate to repay, with- out words, a debt of gratitude ignorantly incurred. Clara's very eagerness to gain the prize, considering, too, all the study time she lost nursing me, will make her lose it. Irving's presence will embarrass her, and the only chance for her to succeed is for me to fail. What do I care for success?  It is true, the beggar boy will look for my name in the printed report; but he will find it next year, and my long sickness will serve as an excuse to both teachers and pupils. "After all, this is a small return for her unwearied kindness to me; but it is the only one in my pswer to make. In music, to-night, the mood of song shall not be upon me; and I'll prepare my harp-strings to snap easily, lest the first note should inspire me; and 15  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7083-00000113"/> 226       LIFE AND ALONE. to-day I will be stupid enough: my parting tribute to the only girl who has ever tempted me to wish that my mother had not forbidden my being intimate with any one. Well, the command has saved me much suf- fering. How sad this day would be to me if Clara and I were friends I Even the loss of her beauty be- fore my eye will make a blank, a space overshadowed by something I must term a regret. Strange I This day, after all, will be in some measure one of disgrace to me. No matter; after school- days, Clara and I will meet in the warm recognition of a true friendship; future love will make up for past coldness; and the beggar boy will know her, and surely together we may testify some deep, lasting gratitude." Edith's resolve was taken, and the bell summoned her to the class. In every recitation she missed, and now only German remained for her to be examined in. The most beautiful passages of Schiller were given her to translate; but the bungling work she made exhausted the patience of the committee, and Clara was called upon. "Edith, you have surely read these lines before," whiSpered she. "Think what you are about. Try again, quickly, or you will lose every chance for a prize." , You are mistaken; these pages were read during my sickness, and I won't try to do them now."   "FE AND ALONE.,      22 Clara instantly announced the fact aloud; but the committee replied that a true knowledge of the lan- guage would enable any scholar to give a passable translation; and Clara was forced to read. She did them justice, and every prize fell to her lot that day. The school broke up to meet once more in the even- ing, and Edith glided away from a group of girls who had gathered around Clara to offer their congratula- tions. "Edith must feel badly," exclaimed one; "where were her wits to-day?" "Not in German land, from the last blunder," said another. "She could easily have read the passages," re- marked Clara, " and by right the prize is hers." "I don't believe that," said Miss Walters; " but, Clara, as you are going to leave us, we do not care for our defeat; and as for Edith Merton, she is a mere genius--sometimes bright, and as often stupid as the rest of us." The unconscious object of their remarks was in her own room, feeling no shade of regret for the day's re- sult, but a thousand times happier than the stately beauty, who likewise sought the seclusion of her own apartment. She drew the bolt of her door, and, fling- ing her prites upon the table, exclaimed,--  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7083-00000114"/> 228       LIFE AND ALONE. "What I toiled for is gained, and in his presence too. How worthless, after all! And this triumph over Edith is only an additional sorrow. My father and mother seemed to take it as a matter of course that I should bear off the palm. How little they knew of the hard study which has gained me the prize I WThat a victory over dull moods, and pains of body I Shall we carry knowledge with us when we bid adieu to earth? Else what use to me? Does it raise one nearer God now? I think not. The veriest dunce may have a Christian light within her soul, and by love and purity of heart, and by a single eye upon divine things, be raised to worship nearer the eternal throne than one who brings to bear upon religion the deepest lore of earth.' By and by the evening bell summoned Clara to the music hall, where, mechanically, she went through her part. It was a splendid performance, and the titled beauty quitted the instrument amid the applause of all. There glided, the next in turn, to her harp, the poor, forlorn scholar who had been distinguished that day only for failure. She wore her ordinary school dress, and with a most dull, uninterested manner, bent over her instrument. Her- music was out of all time, and in low whispers the teacher continually interfered. Then false notes called forth a louder reproof, and   "FE AND ALONE.       229 Edith coolly declared the harp was not tuned to her voice, and she began turning the screws. One string after another snapped. She was ordered to try Miss Melville's harp, and rose from that, saying it was worse than her own. The time was passing, and the teacher - out of all patience - called upon others for music, and then bestowed two prizes-the first to Clara, the second to Kate Mellan, nothing loath to re- ceive the mark of approbation for music, if nothing else, in the presence of Gerard. In an instant the whole truth flashed upon Clara Melville. Edith had purposely kept back her natural powers that she might win every prize, as in music there was no possibility to excel Edith, so great was her gift. Did the conviction of the truth humble and vex the proud beauty? Not at all. She was lost in admiration of the strange girl, who, in so public a manner, could allow a defeat for the advantage of another. She must speak to her one moment to ex- press at least something of gratitude; but that was not to be. With perfect self-possession Edith made her way through the crowd near to Clara, and said a few complimentary words, bade good by, and was gone. "One word, Edith,' said Clara, following her from the room.  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7083-00000115"/> 230       LIFE AND ALONE. "No, Miss Melville; I resist the -temptation of parting words," and she quickly sped away. Clara's eye followed her with intense interest; and such was their leave-taking. Then followed a break- ing-up scene. Teachers, guests, and pupils mingled their farewells. It was a hard task for Clara. -She, too, was to go a few miles towards home that even- ing, and hurried through her adieus. Sick and weary she reached their carriage, and sank back in silence. Surely it was night time to her soul. Thus dawned that future, to which, little more than a year ago, she had looked forward with so much hope and pleasure. In her sumptuous home how often the pale face of Edith rose before her I! how much she wanted her there! but a feeling of delicacy for both Irving and Gerard prevented. When alone, she would bitterly lament the strange weight which seemed crush- ing her to despair. Where was her religion? she would often ask herself. True, she found pleasure in the performance of some of its duties; but afterwards her mind sank into an unnatural gloom. In the family circle, by a masterly effort, she kept up a show of lively spirits; but alone again, she felt the crushing weight of something. When she attempted to probe her sadness with questions such as these-Do we not create much misery for ourselves? Will not reli-   "FE AND ALONE.       231 gion wholly satisfy the soul? Can I not live for others, and bury deep my own anguish? Does not Heaven will what is best?-the pain in her head would grow more intense, and she had not enough control over her thoughts to give any answer. Then again a fear of madness came upon her, and she ceased to hold par- ley with herself. At length to her mother she con- fided the change in her feelings respecting religion. The fond parent gazed upon her child, and believed her perfection, but put the startling question, - "My darling, how will this affect your happiness in a union with Irving-his views so different from yours?" Clara had never dreamed of such a question being put to her. She stared wildly; the cold blood began its chilling drop around her heart. Being in great bodily pain, she was unable to utter one word, and her mother resumed: - "You mistake me, dear. I did not say it would prevent a union with Irving; only, will not his entire want of sympathy in your religious views somewhat mar your happiness? Life will be very bright for you, my darling; it can hardly be- otherwise; but still, if anything suggests a passing cloud, there is no harm in meeting it beforehand." Gerard entered at the moment, and began to urge  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7083-00000116"/> 232       LIFE AND ALONE. something with his mother; and Clara, seeing a long argument pending, quietly left the room. At that moment solitude was insupportable, and she sought her father in the library. - She found him there, and, most unexpectedly, Irving also. "Ah, Clara," said Lord Melville, "you come very opportune. I am so pressed for time, you can do me a great favor. Come, sit here with Irving, and look over this German correspondence; he can take notes as you read - will you?" "Certainly, dear papa; but you had better remain and help us. We could do it in half the time to- gether." "I wish I could, but time is too precious; " and lie left them. Clara had studiously avoided being left alone with Irving; now she could not help herself, and both set to work. Their task finished, Irving turned towards her with an impatient gesture, and exclaimed, - "Clara, do you mean to fulfil the wishes of your father, and 'allow our marriage to take place at the time appointed?" Surprised and almost shocked, at first she merely raised her eyes to his face'; then, feeling that perhaps it was as well some explanation should take place at that time as any other, with a steady, but low voice, she asked,- *   "FE 'AND ALONE.      233 Have you then so soon forgotten Edith?" "Yes; forgotten her in the sense you mean. It was yourself forced her fascinations upon me, and in an evil hour I yielded to them. Their sway upon me was momentary, and I am now ready to fulfil my pledge to you." The cold, indifferent, business-like manner with which the words were uttered grated harshy on the sensi- tive ear of his listener, and, all her pride excited, it was with great difficulty she restrained a haughty reply. Then, after a moment's pause, she asked, in a gentle tone, - "Irving, what would be my surety for the future? No outward rite could bind us closer than my trust in your vows did from the day they were uttered until my last birth-night; but I wish not to upbraid you. As brother and sister we shall always be." "This is absurd, Clara. How will your father re- ceive any such paltry substitute. for the disappoint- ment of his darling wish?" "He need never know my reasons, Irving." -' And, pray, may I ask what excuse you shall give him?  She bowed her head in silence, and, with half-sup- pressed temper, Irving continued, - "Take your revenge, and I will tell you how. Go  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7083-00000117"/> '234      .LIFE AND ALONE, with the truth' to your father; let him hurl me from the position I occupy to the fate of a nameless out- cast; let your brother brand me with the name of coward, for I would refuse to stain my hands in his blood."' "No, Irving; to gratify any feeling of revenge would be to fulfil the engagement you have referred to--to bind you for life to one who did not possess your heart; who must ever recall to your mind the one you do love. To say nothing of my own wretch- edness, I should insure your lasting misery; and your love for Edith Merton is as true this moment as on the night you revealed its existence to her." "This harrowing up of the past is worse than use- less, Clara. Your father now is surprised that no preparations are being made for our wedding, and has even hinted the same to me; there is but one course for us both -forget the past, accept our promise to each other, fulfil yours to me, and I the same to you. Act differently, and you become the agent of my ruin. I ask not now your answer: think well whether once yielding to temptation, in part brought about by your- self, authorizes you to refuse forgiveness and accept reparation. I cannot blot out the past; I must leave it to your mercy, -the instrument with which you may achieve my -ruin, or a pleader in my cause,-   "FE AND ALONE.       235 and to-morrow give me the result of your delibera- tions." "Irving, my answer is yours to-day, and must be the same forever. The blessing of God would not be ours, nor his favor beam any joy into your perjured heart." "Clara, this is madness; worse even, for your ob- stinacy will prove my ruin. Mercy and forgiveness are the high prerogatives of the religion you have em- braced; its very spirit, if rightly understood, would urge-my plea. Protestations of affection your pride would scorn, and you refuse even my request for par. don. I am no saint, I confess." "Irving, tempt me not to probe your motives for this desired union with me; let the subject forever rest between us. In order to allay your fears, hear my promise, that no anger of any member of my family shall ever reach you." "Then we must act in concert," muttered Irving. Clara would not suffer herself to dwell for an instant on the mean fear of detection his words betrayed, but answered quickly, - 'Irving, we cannot act in concert; but have no fear of the result -it will be controlled by a power unto which even you must submit in silence and alone."  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7083-00000118"/> 236       LIFE AND ALONE. With these words she quitted the room. Irving would have detained her; but the interview had been too unsatisfactory to wish to prolong it. He was un- prepared for so decided a refusal, and needed solitude to ponder the best way to remove her reasons. He knew that her mother had never much approved their engagement, and any appeal to either parent would only expose Clara's unwillingness. He would wait, and win her again. There could be no reality in his failure. Clara, in her own room, was trying the vain task to banish thoughts of the cold and heartless way in which Irving again had sought her hand; but they came with a startling power, and she exclaimed with wild despair, - ,i No, no; not once did he breathe the words -his heart had returned to his first, his earliest love. I have wasted and am wasting woman's only gift, the rich treasure of her love, on one who asks not for it, who claims me but to retain his own position and avoid disgrace. Yet, knowing the mean motives by which he is actuated, I love him with all the truth of our earliest years. O, where is my contempt, my pride? Ingulfed in the very depths of love. Shall I remain firm in my decision, or weakly yield to his arguments? Alas I Irving, a stronger power must separate us than my wavering will, which so strongly-   "FE AND ALONE.       237 "nclines to your wish. It is impossible I should longer mistake the warning of the terror coming on apace. I must soon acknowledge what so long has been only an indefinite fear. Disease has made rapid headway in my frame. I must soon lay me down -:in the cold embrace of death, "How wise is God I My love, so tempted, shall be stayed in its course to work guilt in Irving, and now, in the midst of shade and shadow, will only hover over him to work out of earth an angel's blessing. I thank thee, too, my heavenly Father, that thou hast given these warnings of death's approach unto me; for they will save me from myself, and keep me firm in my resolve. The night of the grave will so soon enshroud me I may dwell without harm on my undy- ing love for Irving. My death insures what my life could never procure him pardon without sorrow; and perhaps Edith for his future bride. Hush, my soul I Why feel such agony that Edith may be his? There is neither marriage nor giving in marriage in the land unto which I am hastening; and Christ is to be with me. I need fear no evil; his rod and staff will uphold me, and his love, shining in the valley, will banish all of darkness.". The next morning found Clara in high fever, unable to rise from her bed; and the anxious mother sum-  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7083-00000119"/> 238      LIFE AND ALON-E. mtoned the physician. That old and tried friend of the family no sooner rested his eye on the sick girl than he marked the -fearful progress internal disease had made, and an oft-recurring fear came back to his mind that the hue on her cheek was not the bloom of health; nor had for a long time the fire of her eye betokened it. He had intimated the same to her, but only met-with raillery and a charge not to alarm her parents by any phantom of his brain. Now he was only astonished at the energy which had kept her about so long, and he put only a few questions, to see if she had the faintest realization of her danger. "Doctor," she replied, " one thing you must prom- ise me; not until the last moment- when your skill has failed because God decrees it- must you alarm my parents. I do not think I shall recover, and the blow will be dreadful to my father and mother; but there is no such thing as preparation. They could not be prepared for the event of my death, and you may thus spare them an additional sorrow, If I am to linger weeks, let them be cheered with the hope of my re- covery; if only days, then the last will be time enough to speak. And, doctor, you know -don't you?- that this time your skill will fail." It had often been the old man's duty to announce the fact of approaching death to the sick, and some-   "FE AND ALONE.-       239 times they had told it to him with shrieks and groans; but never before in his long practice had he stood by the bedside of the young and beautiful, and listened to a sad truth so calmly announced. The tears coursed down his cheeks ; the eyes of the beautiful girl flashed only joy. The sad certainty of her fate pressed heav- ily on the aged heart; but Clara, with a smile of sur- passing loveliness, exclaimed, - "I see you know I am right, doctor." He answered not, but decided that the -alarm must quickly be given the hearts of friends if they would seize the moments to prize more dearly her who would soon leave them desolate. His duty was a hard one, but it was done. The proud, the gifted, the gay, and the sorrowing, trod softly through the chamber of sick- ness, and gazed with bursting hearts upon the beau- tiful light of this home. Clara expressed a strong desire to see Edith; she was accordingly sent for. She returned with the messenger, and the sick girl desired to be left all alone with her. First, in a very feeble voice, Clara thanked her for so quickly grant- ing her request. "O, Clara I " said Edith, "is there only this short time allotted me to prove how dearly I could love you, and how intensely I would, now that we are no longer at school together? There my mother had for-  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7083-00000120"/> 240:      LIFE AN ) ALONE. bidden my being intimate with any one, and I always looked forward to the time when I might tell you how grateful I felt, and how much I appreciated all your goodness." "I am content, dear Edith; but our interview must be very calm, or we shall be interrupted. I have much to say to you. Will you take my place here when I am gone? Will you be the daughter of this house, to be cherished as I have been? I was to have been married to Irving. His heart is wholly yours, and you may more than fill my place. Love him, Edith, and be to him the realization of his high ideal. His love for you is the purest, best feeling of his nature, and with that love you may mould him to high pur- poses. It can never fail you; it is a gem of brighter hue than diamonds glistening in the sun or roses wet with dew. I would have you alone wear the jewel - for my sake, for his, and for your own. "Weep not so, dear Edith; I am growing weak, and can say but little more. I can now look back to the first moment I saw you, and understand the feel- ing of interest you then excited in me. It was the mysterious shadowing forth of this my dying wish. My estrangement from you those few days might mean your rejection of Irving. This may seem folly to you, dear Edith; but very clear now is my vision.   "FE AND ALONE.       241.. My whole life is before me, a single page, as it were. I can read it at a glance; and O, may the true affec- tion which unites us, finding utterance now, be an earnest of the deep love which hereafter shall link you and Irving." She paused for want of breath. "But, Clara, dear, this subject is too exciting for you; dwell no more upon it." "No, Edith; excitement has passed for me.' The doctor is mistaken; I shall not linger even the few days he has allotted me; but I do hope my death will be in the morning time. I hope I shall live through this night, and take farewell of you all in the bright morning sunlight." "You must not talk any more, dear Clara, and I fear you are too weak for me to say the few words I wanted to. I have a favor to ask of you." "Speak on, dear Edith; I love to hear your voice. I will lie quiet and listen; that cannot harm me." Edith slightly trembled, and her voice sank into a whisper, as she said,- "What I would tell you is this : You will see my angel mother; you will know her by her startling beauty, so like your own. Your sphere in the land of spirits cannot be far distant from hers, you are so alike in talent and in goodness. I seem to think you 16  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7083-00000121"/> 242       LIr i AND- andija. will instantly recognize each other drawn together, it may be, by Edith, that memory of earth which you must carry with you, darling Clara, for my-sake. If otherwise, seek my mother out, and tell her for me that I have kept her command, and never failed, though I wanted so much to love you. This is the favor I beg." ("I will carry your message, dear Edith; and per- haps mine will be some mission to earth, to bring tidings of the love we bear you in the form of an earthly blessing; but when the summons shall come to you, dear Edith, as it has to me to go hence, O, be prepared I Let not your heart be too closely bound to any earthly joy, if Heaven must be shut out. Carry your hopes to the cross of Christ; they will all be realized there. I am speaking to you now on the threshold of the grave, where, sooner or later, you must lie down beneath its shade; and remember the Saviour, who has given you all things, will accept no divided heart. Him first, then Irving; and this life will be rich unto you; and then the exceeding weight of glory." One and another came into the room, but Clara continued talking, with her eye riveted upon Irving. "How vain appears all human knowledge when the light of the unknown world is nearing on our visionl I have yearned for human lore, when   "FE. AND ALONE.       243 now to know Christ seems the only object worthy the highest powers of the mind." They begged her to cease talking; but she re- plied, - "It cannot hurt me, and I shall go home in the morning. Father, mother, brothers, and sister, dear, hear my voice while you may, for its tones will -be hushed in this chamber too soon for you; you must follow me with something more than memory, whither I go, with hope like mine in Jesus. You must live on in active search for Him, that we may meet again. Beams of glory seem to curtain my heart, and shut out fear and dread that I have to tread the dark path without your love and care; yet I cannot forget you, though left behind, or cease urging you, with my latest breath, to learn at the cross the way H have taken to heaven. Time drags not there its tardy round, and it will hardly seem to me a waiting for you; but with what anxious interest shall I hearken for the watchword of each one of you at the gate of heaven!" Her voice was lost amid the many half-stifled sobs; but her eye wandered round the room, and rested on the face of each loved one. She sank into a gentle slumber, and all was still.. Morning came, and, ac- cording to her wish, with the sun shining brightly  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7083-00000122"/> 24:       LIFE AND ALONE. into her chamber, death began to leave its stamp upon her beautiful features--the marble for the rose tint. The circle of home stood around her bed, and watched in breathless agony every shade of a change passing over the. face they loved. "Does she not breathe?" whispered one softly to the doctor. "Who dares to say she has ceased to breathe?" cried Irving aloud; and he rushed forward to snatch her from that power he now remembered she had told him would separate them. Was it the sound of that voice which alone of earth could overtake the departing spirit, and bid it come back to light up the eye once more with life, and tinge the lip with the pressure of a breath? Even so. Her eyes once more opened, rested their full brilliancy upon Irving; her lips parted with a smile for him, like one worn in the hour of health; and then, that look of love and smile I It meant, it was, - "Farewell!" Not even the frantic cry of Irving could rouse again the sudden-formed clay. The tears and groans of a household fell like water upon ice. "And this is death," thought Edith, as she drew near the lifeless form, and took the hand, so cold, within her own; then started back. at the chilly touch, and wished her last grasp had been when warmed   LIFE AND ALONE.       245 with life. Days afterwards, when the body was laid in rich pomp and state, to be once more gazed upon ere placed in the tomb, Edith heard several persons say, "How beautiful I Long did she ponder over the words. What could they mean? Had they said, "( How beautiful she was in life- I "-but to look upon that cold wreck and call it beauty, she could not com- prehend their meaning; and, turning to Irving, she whispered, - "Clara's departed spirit shrouded itself in her beauty; can you see any left?" "Only the image on my heart," was the deeply sad reply. The lid of the casket was closed, and the coffin, with its treasure, put in the family tomb; and after that, more pleasant thoughts of Clara took possession of Edith's mind. Gradually the chilly remembrance of that last touch passedaway; and her image, beau- tiful as in life, became engraved on her heart. It would seem Clara felt assured that Edith would take her place in the affections of her family, by the dis- tribution she had made in writing of her possessions, and the reference to her in almost every line. To a great degree her wish was fulfilled, and Edith was regarded with no common interest by all who had known and loved Clara; but none indulged the thought  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7083-00000123"/> 246       LIFE AND ALONE. that the place of the beautiful, talented daughter could be made good by any one. In the deep sanctuary of her own thoughts-no utterance ever given in words- Lady Melville had sometimes thought, as she watched the dark moods of Irving, that she had rather her child were laid in the grave, than ever become his wife; but now, this shad- owed wish realized, her heart smote her for it,- as if the thought conceived had aught to do with the event, - and her grief was increased tenfold. Lord Melville was deeply affected by the death of his daugh- ter; but his pride missed more the brilliant companion, the ornament and beauty which had so nobly graced his mansion, and the grand object for whose future he had toiled. But now, if possible, his heart turned towards Irving with a stronger interest, and he found something like consolation for his loss in pushing him forward to the very height of his ambitious career. Irving returned this affection with double force, and with more manifest feeling than had ever marked their intercourse, and with more of truth. Gerard had dear- ly loved his sister, but never appreciated the high tone of her character. Her virtues were a sealed book unto him, and with his grief was mingled the deepest feeling of pity for Irving. He would try every method in his power to divert the gloom into which his brother   "FE AND ALONE.       24' would fall at the most distant allusion to Clara, and for his sake all the family assumed a cheerfulness they were far from feeling. Perhaps the unnamed one, from this very pall of silence, had a more potent influ- ence lpon the hearts of every member of the family than if she had been daily talked about. i  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7083-00000124"/> 248      LIFE AND ALONE. CHAPTER    XIV. ONE day Lady Melville handed Irving a sealed let- ter she had found among Clara's papers directed to him. In silence he took the letter, but reserved its perusal until night brought the quiet hour alone in the library. No member of the family now ever in- truded upon him there. Taking the letter from his pocket, he read as follows what bore a late date:- "In my own private desk--which is yours, dear Irving- will be found a few -pages for your eye alone, written upon that birth-night so well remem- bered by us both. You will there read the true state- ment of my feelings when I found the love so prized by me was given to another; but it is for me now, more than a year'having passed since that event, to prove to you what we have so often argued, and upon which you were so sceptical --the depth and power of a woman's love. You will believe me- for now, upon the border of the grave, I can have no motive for deception -when IF tell you that there has never s .    "FE AND- 'ALONE.      249 beaten in my heart but one wild thought of love for you, from childhood's lisp of Irving's name, until to- day, when fast-increasing weakness almost prevents my writing. I fear no higher principle, nothing- but the certain knowledge. that death had marked me for his own, gave me strength to resist your wish, and determine that a brother's and sister's intercourse should alone be ours. "Now, Irving, when Clara is recalled, only remem- ber her as having lived ; and the truth, that there is in woman's breast no death-note to love; and when her presence shall be missed, think only that I, an angel, have borne your name upwards, and am weaving it with sparkling gems in a crown you may wear in heaven. This is my labor of never-dying love in the home of the blessed. But, Irving, there is a higher love than mine, which claims you to be of the re- deemed - even Christ's. Human effort in knowledge cannot prepare the heart for that higher love. At the cross pardon must be sought with the humility of a child and the trust of a whole heart's depen- dence." Here the writing abruptly ended. No name was signed, and the last few lines showed how feeble was the hand that traced them. Again and again Irving read the paper. Could it be possible, he thought,  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7083-00000125"/> 250       LIFE AND ALONE. that it contained not one word of reproof, nor breathed of the sorrow which -he firmly believed had been the first cause of her illness? What to him was' Edith now but a bitter, wretched thought, compared to the love whose worth he learned too late? Was it only loss that could give him an insight into his own heart, and reveal, too late for happiness, that the first chosen was the true ideal? He took from his neck a black ribbon, always worn hidden from view, and from which hung a curiously wrought gold casket opening by a secret spring. In this he put Clara's note, and re- placed the band around his neck. Burying his face in both hands, he exclaimed,- "This casket henceforth and forever presses against a widowed heart, and solemnly I swear that never shall an earthly love find harbor here again. May every pulse cease to beat, and life go out in anguish, sooner than I break even in thought this vow by which I bind myself. I was never worthy the love whose revelation this casket contains; but here upon earth I will begin to follow thee, Clara, to thy new home, and pray Gqd's pardon not only for the deep wrong I have done thee, but for the sins of a lifetime." From that day dated the era of a mighty change in Irving. Friends wondered at the softened tone of the lofty-bearing genius, and felt themselves linked i   "FE AND ALONE.       251 by a new and mysterious charm to one whom they had always admired, but never dared to love. The mother, as she bowed beneath the influence of an elevated and purified character, felt to weep anew that the flowers would bloom and fade over the tomb of her child, but she never come forth to welcome the virtues which had taken such deep root in the heart of the one so loved. Lord Melville alone could see no difference in Irving. What was he now that he had not always been to him?- the continued realiza- tion of every ambition of his heart-the embodied talent of his own high ideal. He saw Irving take -his: seat among the nobles of the land, and listened- in proud silence to the voice which electrified the crowd; but his heart acknowledged more tumultuous joy at the honors his countrymen heaped upon him--the son of his adoption - more than ever for an instant throbbed Irving's breast. He calmly smiled his re- ception of public applause, or acknowledged it with words of grateful eloquence, all the time tracing upon his heart, by the power of an inner thought, an angel form -laboring upon a crown immortal he one day hoped to wear. One delicious summer evening Ir- ving was half reclining upon a couch, in a sort of arbor Lady Blanche had had constructed to suit Ida's taste, and which bore a less gloomy aspect than aught  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7083-00000126"/> 252      LIFE AND ALONE. else upon the estate. Lady Glenville had been carry. ing on a desultory conversation with him, when her manner suddenly grew animated, and she asked,- "Why is it, Irving, that our talk now never turns upon Edith Merton?" "With your woman's tact, I should have thought you would have discovered the reason; but, as you put the question, I'll answer it by another: Is it not because I, the rejected lover, have ceased to love? not but that Edith will ever be an object of deep in- terest to me." "I do not doubt that, Irving, and something more in the future." "I do not deny, Lady Blanche, the language of passion or its truth I made use of when I opened my heart to you long ago; but in your own experience did you ever find aught lasting which pleased in a moment of excited feeling, meeting obstacles which served to keep alive, though not deepen, the impres- sion? - or any endearing truth in a feeling born of passion, if it swayed one from honor? Thoughts of Edith Merton only prove to me the remark." "Then, Irving, why so obstinately refuse to join our party to Italy, if no such tie binds you here?" "And is 'love the only cause a woman ever arrives at for a reason, Lady Blanche?    "FE AND ALONE.      253 "Nay, Irving, you are only laughing at me now. What could I think, when even your father urged upon you change of scene, and you replied you could not leave, but that your heart was here. I knew no parliamentary business need detain you here, and I very naturally supposed you did not wish to leave Edith's vicinity." Very well explained, Lady Blanche; but did it never occur to you that there were people in the world so wedded to old associations they cared not to stray from them? I am of the number. I have no taste for travelling; I like not its inconveniences; I love better the security of home, surrounded by fa- miliar objects, and the mind tended by long-accus- tomed thoughts." The lady did not comprehend the sentiment, and she abruptly put the question,- "Would you like to know another motive I have for urging you to go with us?" "Say all, Lady Blanche ; I know your motives are most kind." "Then, in plain truth, as Edith Merton is dethroned, I intend Ida for you, and if you consent to go with us on our journey, Ida will, but if not, I shall leave her at Mrs. Bertrand's." For a moment the pale features of the Italian  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7083-00000127"/> 254:      LIFE AND ALONE. flushed, then grew white, and his voice was low and tremulous as he replied, - "Of all subjects to jest upon, the one you have chosen appears to me the most inappropriate. There is a sacredness which should deter the lips breathing aught lightly upon that heart-mystery we term love. Its power to create joy, or to wound, is too complete to admit of mirth, too sacred to be rolled in the dust of common words." "Spare me, Irving, this homily upon love, or you commit the very wrong you deprecate. I never was more in earnest in my life, though, had I not heard you say what you did of Edith, I never should have breathed the subject, I'll assure you." "In earnest, my dear Lady Blanche? Then let me speak more plainly of Edith Merton, and reveal to you the dark side of my intercourse with her. The words I have spoken to her are seared upon my heart, not with feeling or desire, but in deep self-reproach. Had they never been uttered, her we mourned dead would be living at this hour - my promised bride, my wife." Then with wild vehemence he continued, - "I have decked one in her robe of white, and thrown the shroud around her, instead of the bridal veil. I have laid her in a cold and narrow coffin in the hey- day of her youth, instead of cherishing her in these   arms. On the brow my lips might have pressed love, the damps of death have gathered, and this is the man on whom you would bestow your only daughter. Love and burial I strange terms to be united, but I know them not apart." In the heart of his listener a chord was struck by these impassioned words far remote from the future disposal of her child; but it was a note on which Lady Glenville dared not allow thought to linger, and hastily rising, she complained of the night air. Both sauntered towards the house. Gerard, Kate Mellan, and Ida were within, talking merrily. It might be the- unexpected entrance of Lord Glenville which so paled Lady Blanche's cheek, as she joined the gay trio and made an effort to be interested. Irving gen- erously engaged the old lord in one of his long and oft-repeated stories, while the words of Ida fell upon his ear. "Mamma! mamma!" she shouted; "I have lis- tened to a bona fide offer, and not made to myself, either." "I should hope not, Ida, for six years to come," answered her mother. "Kate is not so very much older than 1,"' pouted out the beauty. That night, on their homeward way, Kate Mellan  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7083-00000128"/> 256       LIFE AND ALONE. received and plighted troth with Gerard. What had been said in sport by Ida unsealed his lips, and Edith's words proved true. There was no refusal. A few days after the funeral of Clara, Edith had returned to school, and there, engrossed with study, one day passed as another. For recreation she indulged in her usual reverie. Mrs. Bertrand gave more special heed to her, and in the effort to know her better formed a strong attachment for the gifted girl. They could talk of Clara, - which was a theme Edith never tired of,--and this united love for the dead drew teacher and pupil nearer together than aught else could have done. No more letters from home came to Edith, except that money was regularly sent for school bills; and Mrs. Bertrand, in this ever-increas- ing interest for her pupil, desired to make her some- thing more than a mere literary woman, and to com- mence that home-like education so necessary for every female. With much shrinking timidity at first, by degrees she unfolded her plan to Edith, and, to her surprise, found a cordial assent to all she proposed. The same energy which was shown in study aided Edith in learning the more commonplace duties of life. Her natural taste would have preferred a book, but her keen judgment relished the teacher's advice. Mrs. Bertrand felt that she now witnessed the stamp   "FE AND ALONE.,       257 of true genius, which could unbend itself from a lofty height, and come down to meaner occupations for the day, -at least meaner in the view compared with other efforts for her to decide upon. There was, fur- thermore, a rare independence of character shown in one thus alone stepping out of the beaten track of school accomplishments and descending to the kitchen, to the seamstress-room, to learn what would never come amiss in any station of life,-incurring the sneers and sarcasms of the titled young damsels who preferred to deny all knowledge how the dainty luxu- ries they deigned to eat were prepared, and to plead astonished ignorance of sewing terms, with the excep- tion of tent or laid stitch. Mrs. Bertrand often put to herself the question, What were Edith Merton's faults, where there was so much to admire? Had she attempted in particular the religious education of her pupil, she might have answered the question, but perhaps failed to improve, because Edith's natural reserve was a hard barrier to surmount. In no degree was Edith blind to her own defects. She knew and mourned a sinful pride which brooked no opposition, a secret contempt for those behind her in the race of study, a self-appreciation which placed her above the good or bad opinion of others, a temper to preserve her own rights whatever IT  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7083-00000129"/> 258       LIFE AND ALONE. the consequences, an unyielding individuality, a heart too deeply engrossed with the love of an ideal and bright dreams for a future, a stern, unbending will, dependent upon her own strength of mind; and all these self-readings were mixed up with convictions of religious duty- thought about, but never acted upon. Her idea of life's most prominent duty was sincere and active piety -the idea a dead weight upon her soul. This and much more was Edith's comprehen- sion of her own character: all might be summed up in the one word selfishness, or varied shades of fault all merging to the one point, self. The simple but strong recognition of faith, which had been her very childhood's own, never deserted her ; though the next thought was, "Faith without works is dead." Reli- gion was like an incubus resting upon her mind, a divinity she would enshroud, enjoy, but not an active principle. There was the attempt made to consecrate the untried hours of every day to God, and a sort of satisfaction felt and reliance on the effort. The night's prayer would prove to her how the day had been a failure; and thus the struggle went on, while fear ruled the darker hour which morning would disperse. It was a strange fact, that day after day found this brilliant girl a stranger to real peace of mind save during the half hour of a morning devotion, and no   "FE AND ALONE.       259 progress ever made in true heart-change; -nor did the evening's more unquiet thoughts deepen into that re- pentance which needeth not to be repented of. There was a wearying struggle of the mind to be free in the gospel freedom, and a precious knowledge and' idea lot in groundless hope and inaction. Early one morning, Edith was summoned to the parlor to meet Irving and a strange gentleman. Her intercourse with the former had assumed a kindlier tone, now that the subject of love was dead between them, and she gave him a pleasant greeting; after which he introduced her to the Abbd D'Estrand. He was a man apparently of middle age, of very stern as- pect, of Italian origin, and his bearing was lofty in the extreme. He merely glanced at Edith, turned away as if disappointed in her appearance, and ad- dressed some remark to Irving. A long conversation ensued, and Edith sat by unnoticed. She began to study minutely the stranger before her. She noticed he wore a diamond cross, the exact counterpart of her own; and what struck her as singular, the chain at- tached to the guard-pin was of the same curious work- manship as her own. She discovered that he wore a wig, sprinkled here and there with a gray hair, which made it look very natural; but there had fallen on his collar behind a stray lock of lighter brown hair.  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7083-00000130"/> 260       LIFE AND ALONE. But she supposed, as a priest, his head was shorn on the top, and he might wear a wig on that account. On the whole, the man's face was most repulsive to her; and while arriving at this conclusion, she had entirely lost the thread of their discussion, till she found herself suddenly addressed with, "'Daughter, what have you, read during your si- lence?." '      ' ' "Concealment," she replied, promptly, "but no very good reason for a disguise." The abb6 darted a quick, searching glance at her; but Irving gave little heed, thinking it one of Edith's odd remarks, and asked her for some music, say- ing,- : "I have told the abbg of your wonderful skill, and wish to prove to him that England can rival Italy in one instance." 'I believe all you say, my-young friend," inter- rupted the" abb ; "' but music affords me no pleasure, except in our religious services. Indeed, when hear- ing a fine voice, I only regret its meaner use, the loss that it should not be travelling, upward in the. highest strain: therefore, young lady, I will not hear you sing; but, as I see the symbol of our holy religion upon your breast, its letter and life, I trust, are in your heart."   "FE AND ALONE.       261 "I fear I wear it, sir, from no such holy motive." {Then, daughter, perhaps it is the gift of some dear friend, and, though cherished on that account, ought still, from its emblematical sacredness, to be suggestive of a higher Friend than any of earthly re- lationiship."  "The giver," said Edith, quietly, ," whoever she or he may be, is unknown to me; and the ornament is merely worn with an earthly hope of its future recog- nition by the giver." "Then," answered the abbd, looking. sternly at heri "it will assuredly become the instrument to wound you; for such thoughts, the mere creation 'of vanity, are blemishes upon the heart which Providence sends some sorrow to remove ;" and then, turning to Irving, he continued in a different tone,- - "What has grieved me most in this fair land of yours is the little sacredness apparently attached to emblems, which, in my own country, claim a rever- ence. Life here seems a heedlessness, a swift present without a future, an existence without a soul." "Would not your profession prompt you to judge us most severely?" asked Irving. . "I think not," said the abb ; " for is not the spirit of our religion yours? A Paul and a Peter thought alike. More thought and less levity would even draw  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7083-00000131"/> 262       LIFE AND ALONE. you, as a people, nearer the fold from which you have strayed. Your boasted reformation of abuses seems to have paved the way for every degree. of error, to have opened avenues for all sorts of loose opinion from which sects spring up, and will continue to do so, until any man of even slight presumption may gather around himself supporters of his own vain and ignorant opinions." "But," asked Irving, "would not a lifetime of active goodness be lost in the study necessary to re- trace our steps?" "Not while there are teachers assigned by. God, young man, to show the true way. As the Spirit has deposited the key of all mysteries in his church, surely it is safe there to seek the true way. These opinion- ated persons forming sects, dispersed by a doubt or a breath, have their day and their hour; but Providence will take care of his own." Edith was getting heartily tired of the conversa- tion, when the abbe turned to her, and said, - "You will pardon an old man's freedom of speech, if I dwell a moment upon an error your sex are liable to -fall into. I mean that restless looking forward to a coming happiness bearing no relation to the true les- son of life, often so cherished as to spread throughout the heart's chamber, and weaken and ruin the harmony   "FE AND ALONE.       263 which might and ought to reign there. This running rampant of imagination is the origin of all the gloom which envelops religion whenever the disappointed soul falls back upon that choice. The spirit, unable to shake off the shackles of its day-dreams, how can it emerge into the deep serenity of a holy confidence in God? Our faculty for belief and worship is claimed by the Creator, and why should it be wasted upon earth-bound hopes -mere dew-drops dried up by the sunlight of reality? We cannot have both happiness and blessedness." "The joy of anticipation," answered Edith, with al scornful smile, " amply repays, and we gain strength of character sufficient by calmly meeting every event in life's checkered pathway." "Not so, young lady; you enervate the mind, and throw to the winds a treasure of golden thought which might be lastingly rich in meditation upon Deity. You plant seeds in your heart whose harvest is a bitterness no after-care can entirely eradicate. Thus forever in the system lurks the poison of useless reverie. And, daughter, when these dreams have ceased to charm, what shall fill the void? Let me urge upon you to begin that discipline which shall yield a richer con- tent by and by. 'Go forth to meet a future with an unwavering trust in Providence, a serene mind with-  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7083-00000132"/> 264       LIFE AND ALONE. out created fancies of your own - the thistles which will strike most disastrous root. And to you, young man, I say the same with an added lesson. To you there is ambition- a panacea for every woe. It is never too late for a man to astonish himself or the world, but the heart of a woman must live in her home, and prepare for the winter of life." Mrs. Bertrand came in to see the distinguished foreigner, and the conversation took a different turn; yet Edith's first impression of dislike towards him in- creased every moment. When he took leave, he turned towards her, and said, in a low voice,- . "My daughter, I have heard much of you from mutual acquaintances in this vicinity. Your parents, also, were warm friends of mine--especially your mother, whom I perceive you do not in the least re- semble. I have heard she is no more. 3Have you a miniature of her? I should be much pleased to see it." Astonished beyond measure, Edith stammered forth a reply that she had none, but there was one in the possession of Lady Glenville. A gleam of satisfac- tion shot from the dark eye of the priest, giving his face an almost fiendish expression. His object was accomplished, and the few words of his leave-taking were hurried through, leaving a still more unpleasant impression.   "FE AND ALONE.       265 "The papers seem to do more than justice to this very common individual, I should say," remarked Mrs. Bertrand, "and, really, very shallow were his , lews respecting education. Did you listen to what he said, Edith?" "No, ma'am; I was talking to Irving, and would rather have not seen the stranger at all." How often are we on the threshold of happiness, and know it not until Time, the mighty revealer of mystery, sends us back to the'day, to the very hour, when the knowledge of all the heart craves might have been ours! Could Edith Merton have known, at the time, that the tutor of her long-cherished love had sat near her the- past hour, the very fact would have been to her intense enjoyment. Every word which fell from his lips would have been garnered up as pearls richer than the true gem, and of more real worth. Another thread would have been woven in the silver tissue of her day-dreams of exceeding bright- ness; but under strange and appalling circumstances did memory bring to her the knowledge that they two had met. "I knew the mother of that young lady," said the abbe, as, seated beside Irving in the carriage, they were rolling homeward. "She was a very brilliant woman, married to a clown, and sank into a cipher;  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7083-00000133"/> 266       LIFE AND ALONE. but in Venice, where we met, friends and admirers would have prophesied a different fate." "And your opinion of the daughter?" smilingly asked Irving. "Nothing attractive," answered the abb, '" or rather a singularity which is very unattractive. With beauty, talent in a woman may assume any vagaries; but with- out it, gifts of mind are a fruitful source of misery to their possessor, however their exercise may afford gratification to others." Irving did not at all agree with the sentiment, but cared not to argue the matter, and found another sub- ject to call forth the interest of his companion.   "FE AND ALONE.       26T CHAPTER    XV. IT was a festive night at Glenville Castle, and a brilliant company was assembled there. Its owner, before departing for Italy, took this method of saying adieu to familiar faces whom he could have little hope to see again in his own land. With health enfeebled he sought change of climate, and he had decided that his wife should accompany him, more from anxiety in leaving her behind than from personal pleasure derived in her society. Ida was to remain at Mrs. Bertrand's. Naples had been Lady Blanche's early home, and it was the last place on earth she desired to revisit in company with Lord Glenville, and some disinclina- tion expressed in his hearing had decided her fate. To-night, with Irving, came the Abbe D'Estrand. When presented to Lady Glenville he gazed longer than politeness might warrant upon her very lovely features, and made some remark to Irving upon her beauty. "She is less lovely than usual to-night," said Ir-  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7083-00000134"/> 268       LIFE AND ALONE. ving; "being on the eve of a journey to your land, and not inclined to leave England just at present, her feelings are written legibly upon her face, and have banished all her brilliant smiles. However, she is queen of beauty now of this realm." His voice faltered on that little word now. Per- haps he remembered one much younger, and more beautiful, who was wont to be the chief ornament of any such festive scene. The abbe seized the first moment to attach himself to Lady Blanche, and to- gether they sauntered out into the brilliantly illumined grounds. Tables of refreshment were placed beneath the wide-spreading oak trees, and bands of music at no great distance. They passed by these, and found themselves almost alone. "t We  priests," exclaimed the abb6, " fair lady, are, or should ever be, on the watch to benefit our fellow- creatures; and I should feel the hour not lost if I could in any degree reconcile you to this contemplated visit to my own country. The new enjoyments offered you will banish the sad memories which ever cluster round the scenes of one's youth, and make you as loath to leave us again as you now are to quit Eng- land." "I prefer England," was the haughty reply. With infinite tact her companion changed the   "FE AND ALONE.       269 theme. He spoke of Mrs. Bertrand's establishment, of Ida, of Edith Merton, and her peculiarities, which, he said, might be traced to some error in home educa- tion, and added, - "I never knew whom my friend Merton married- the name I mean. I did hear he was wedded to some peerless beauty of Naples, and, on learning whom, asked Miss' Alerton to show me a likeness of her mother, and she said you would do me that favor." "Yes, I have it," said Lady Blanche; "we were once warm friends, but now I wear the locket as a sort of penance " "Ah  I n some degree or other you all favor our opinions. Permit me to put this miniature in my pocket; I will return it in the course of the evening: and now let me tell you what you shall do to enjoy Naples."  And immediately; with such consummate skill did he depict the honors and attentions she would receive in Italy, that, her vanity fully aroused, she forgot his question, or that he had the locket. The hours of that night sped on golden wings; the smiles of the fair- hostess had been won back by a master hand, and the abbe said to her, on taking leave, - "Our next meeting, fair lady, will be where your charms and beauty may receive their full share of adulation; but even there, and then, let me be recog- nized as an old friend."  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7083-00000135"/> 270       LIFE AND ALONE. He was gone, with the miniature safe in his posses- sion. Alone in his own apartment the locket was unclasped, and he gazed upon its revealed face with all the ardor of a young lover. He read the initials on the back of it, and exclaimed, - "It is indeed my own property. It seems but yesterday the deed was done, the agony complete." Then rushed through his mind with awful force the whole story of his love, its few bright moments, its bitter termination. There must have been some strong forces at work within, if the tears rolling down his cheeks were proof, or his low, stifled groans expres- sive. Be it as it may, the strong man became a child, alone with a toy. The gray light of morning dawned upon him as he sat with that locket in his hand. Glenville Castle bore tokens of desertion, and two travellers went on their journey - the one, with all the querulousness of age and invalidism, constantly twitting of wrongs, real or imaginary; the other, in the bloom of her beauty, and with the worm at her heart, sat beside him, with all the mockery of attention to his complaining; and day after day, in tired wretchedness, they pursued their journey. Lady Blanche's mind was not of that order to enjoy any beauty of scenery,--the varieties of travelling, - or turn from present discontent to a more   "FE AND ALONE.       271 promising future. The silence of contempt was now her only effort to establish peace, while her apparent meek endurance rather irritated than soothed her com- panion. An Italian villa, surrounded by all the beauty of which nature is so lavish, or that wealth could buy, was finally their resting-place. No outward splendor was wanting to gild their woe, and letters procured friends. Already Lady Blanche drew numbers into the charmed circle of her attractions, while the inva- lid, annoyed by a continual jealousy of his fascinating wife, added new fever to his disease, and sank rather than recruited. The Abbe D'Estrand was among K the first to seek theem out, and to Lady Blanche he restored her minia- ture; but the careless eye of the lady never detected it was a copy returned to her. She merely looked a moment at the initials engraved there, and the obser- vant abbe saw the unbidden tear start, and a power of control exercised he had not given her credit for, as with a gay laugh she began to expatiate on some of the inconveniences she had been subject to. The abbe proposed a drive to the Baron de Montville's. "Why I she has never noticed me," was Lady Blanche's objection. "The baroness," returned the abb6, "is a confirmed invalid, has given up all claims upon society, and lives  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7083-00000136"/> 272       LIFE AND ALONE. in great seclusion; but you will find the baron's name among the cards left for Lord Glenville, and I want to show you some very rare and exquisite paintings; besides, I want to show you to my friends." Lady Blanche laughed, and said, . "I am neither a judge of paintings nor fond of sight-seeing; and rest assured nothing but a slight curiosity to see your home-which, after all, may be no more worth seeing than other people's -induces me to accompany you." An imperceptible smile played round the mouth of the abbe, as he replied, - "True, my home is in no way remarkable, axcept in some gems of-art, which you say you have no taste for; but in many respects the old baron himself would interest you. 'His powers of conversation are an ac- knowledged charm throughout the city, unrivalled, I assure you." It was now Lady Glenville's turn to smile, and for once a sarcasm might have escaped her lips; but a spark of delicacy prompted the thought that some- thing was due her husband in public. As yet no per- -son had ever stepped between these ill-mated ones, or heard from her the details of her miserable home life. Irving may have often suspected it, in his endeavor to shield her occasionally; but never had he offered her a word of sympathy, nor had she claimed any of   "FE AND ALONE.       273 him. The distance from her villa to the Baron Mont- ville's was a long one ; and what cared she for scenes of interest from classic lore, pointed out to her by the abbe, or his philosophical reflections over some pile of ruins? Had he told her some thrilling tale of romance, though old as the troubadour's song, she would have flashed upon him eyes full of interest and bestowed her liveliest attention; but just as she was thinking how foolish to condemn herself to such a tedious drive with a prosy old priest, and inwardly laughing with vexation, the carriage stopped in front of an imposing-looking palace, and the abbe pro- nounced, -- "The Baron de Montville's. As you have no love for sight-seeing, we will go at once to the library for refreshments; but afterwards I must show you one painting, the work of my pupil, and the scene taken from your own loved England." "If you will spare me an introduction, abb6, to your baron, I will promise to look at, and even ad- mire, the picture."- The abbe bowed, and in silence led the way to the library. As they entered, she saw, half reclining upon a couch near an open window, through which came the perfume of mingled flower and fruit, an elderly gentleman, clad in almost regal magnificence. He 18  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7083-00000137"/> 274       LIFE AND ALONE. instantly rose, and with most polished greeting ad- vanced towards her. The figure of her husband, alike and yet contrasted, was in her mind's eye at the moment, and her smile was half sad, her look earnest, as she returned the kind welcome, and a blush of shame mantled her cheeks as the abbe pronounced their names, remembering her request to him. "An old man must be pardoned," said the baron, "for gazing a few- moments on the beauty his coun- trymen have extolled so highly; but he must not en- tirely forget his politeness, or the pleasure he may afford another who has also much desired to see you, fair lady. Allow me to present to you my young friend,--who sometimes boasts of English birth, which I think an error of the cradle supported only by his name,- Herbert Rothschild, Lady Glenville." Was it the- more exquisite and finished beauty of Irving's face before her, without its sombre look and repellent glance? The resemblance between the two struck her instantly, but she hastened to reply,-' "We   will certainly claim Mr. Rothschild for an Englishman." The young man's voice and manner were totally unlike Irving's, as he replied,- "I think English voices must have done more than to' awake the sleep of the cradle, for my mother- tongue was certainly yours, fair lady, and I heard no other far into my boyhood." 9    "FE AND ALONE.       275 'Well, well," interrupted the baron, "let me in- quire, Lady Glenville, if your prejudices are all in favor of your own country." ".Not to the exclusion of a high regard for the pleasant acquaintances formed here;" and much to the astonishment of the baron, her words were in the purest Italian. "Then you speak Italian, and I shall offend your ear no longer with my imperfect English. Have you thus quickly acquired our language, as well as won our hearts?" "The early part of my life was spent here." Simple the words, but how they jarred her very heart- strings as she uttered them I "Herbert," continued the baron, "with his strange hankering after everything English, will beg you to allow him to pay his respects to your husband, Lord Glenville." "Give me a  better motive, baron, than the mere desire to speak the language I love so well; perhaps I deserve no less selfish a one." The abbe marked the look of admiration he bent upon the lady. She, too, observed it, and felt more than usual this' simple tribute to her beauty. Both were mistaken, for Rothschild only was thinking that Edith Merton had been the lady's guest.

"I should, indeed, be very ungrateful," she re- plied, "if I had; now show it to me," and she fol- loweed him to his own parlor. Lady Glenville had said the truth when she de- clared she had no taste for the beauties of art; but she now stood as if spell-bound before a small land- scape. The scene was perfectly familiar to her; it represented a country house, a village at a little dis- tance, on the other side a deep forest, indicating a path therein, a rude wooden cross painted red. It was a very simple view, and scarcely for merit de- served a place among the rich collection there. With a face deadly pale, and a tremble in her voice, Lady Blanche began to put a question; but the abb6 hastened to answer "That is merely a boyish attempt of Herbert's, painted any number of years ago, from a copy he picked up from some travelling artist. If it pleases you, pray accept it." "Not for worlds. I do not fancy it at all; but it is a perfect sketch of Edith Merton's home, and would   "FE AND ALONE.       2" be valued by her. I think I will accept it, and for- ward it to her, if you will permit that disposal of it." "Certainly; it is hers if you wish." "Then, abbe, let the picture be a gift from you; she will feel flattered at your remembrance of her." "Nay, Lady Glenville, the gift was your own pro- posal. I will send it to your carriage." Lady Blanche strolled through the rooms, till she stood before a full-length portrait of Rothschild taken when a boy. "This must be your pupil, painted when he was indeed a boy scholar. I don't know why I should recognize it, for he has greatly altered." "Very true," replied the abb6, as he directed her attention to another likeness of him. "Ah, this is he " she exclaimed, involuntarily; "and how life-like!" "Yes; that is the work of a distinguished artist in Florence, of whom Herbert took a few lessons; but I urged his discontinuing painting, as not the pro- fession, even here, I would choose for him." "I fancy there is a marked resemblance to Irving Melville in this painting; do you not think so?" asked Lady Blanche. "I cannot say that I do, and, with my knowledge of young Melville, should judge they were as strongly  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7083-00000139"/> 278      LIFE AND ALONE. unlike in character." Lady Blanche, imagining the remark cast a slight upon Irving, replied, - "We are all justly proud of that young man, sir, and our only regret is, that he is not by birth an Englishman." "His native land, I think, then, should have the first claim upon his talents," said the abb6, dryly. "Lord Melville would not consent to that. Irving never will leave England." "I am compelled to disagree with you, lady; your 'never will prove a mistake. I believe in o-ne's nat- ural affection for his native land as well as kindred. Circumstances for a time may dissever, but Nature at last always gains her ends. Education and talent but arouse to action this inherent longing of the soul after its own." Lady Blanche thought the sentence quite long enough, and expressed a sudden desire to return home. As they drove along, she inquired of the abbe, who among the daughters of the sunny south, was destined to become the brae of his pupil. "A priest for a tutor would hardly be supposed to have presented that idea of earthly felicity." "What I You do not mean he is intended for the priesthood? Heaven take care of our souls at the confessional I " The abbe frowned, and Lady Blanche, r   "FE AND ALONE.       279 nothing daunted, went on: "Is it possible his own inclination leads him to- that life-burial?" "It is an active death, Lady Glenville, and one that insures a threefold blessing- to the church, to the world at large, and to one's self." "As an English woman, I have but little knowledge of your order, or the good you may do. I can ima- gine a weak-minded woman seeking a retreat from sor- row, or a learned man liking the retirement of a mon- astery for study, but for an ambitious youth to indulge that idea for his future is too horrible." i"I will relieve your fears respecting young Roth- schild. He has no such intention ; but let me remind you, in virtue of my holy office, that there is but one safeguard amid the storms of life, and that-is to be found in this very faith you speak so lightly of." "Pardon me, abbe--not lightly, at all; for Catholi- cism has been the curse of our family." "May not your having wandered from its fold have been the true curse?" "No! And we could hardly have chosen a subject so fraught with bitter memories to myself; and let me now invite you to enter the house, and handle some more agreeable topic with Lord Glenville." The abbe refused, and Lady Blanche, burdened with a host of sad thoughts their conversation had  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7083-00000140"/> 280      LIFE AND ALONE. aroused, sought the retirement of her own rooms. During her married life thus far, she had claimed only an open admiration for her wonderful beauty, and due attention to her rank. She had been accused of a partiality for Irving, at which the two laughed, and the lady bluntly said, she intended him for Ida. At the time of her marriage with Lord Glenville, it was reported she had taken that gentleman out of pique, and that an engagement of long standing with another ,was broken off for reasons not very creditable to her- self; but rumor is not always truth. It was evident her after-life bore no trace of any deep romance hav- ing colored its morning, and no one dreamed of pity- ing this gay votary of fashion, unless it might be Irving. Now to Lady Glenville came the hour of tempta- tion, as it cometh in some form or shape to us all, and the presence of Rothschild was to her a very heart- craving.  He became a constant visitor at the villa, and-- what   never happened before -was  alike sought after by Lord Glenville. His wife's favorites were seldom or never tolerated by him; but in this instance the scandal of the day reached not the old man's ears, and increasing debility made him prize highly Rothschild's kind efforts to amuse. As to our hero, he had a far different motive than the world   "FE AND ALONE.       281 gave him credit for in bestowing and receiving homage from the reigning star. He would endure a whole day's nonsense from the vain woman, if perchance an allusion to Edith Merton might fall from her lips. She told. him the story of Irving's love and rejection, and his manner assumed a new tenderness towards her, as she mentioned in mirth the beggar boy; for a thrill of joy went through his heart in acknowledg- ment that he had no rival, and he knew full well who was meant by that term. The abbe saw this intimacy with increasing dread and alarm, and spared no op- portunity to express his contempt for Lady Glenville's vain attempts at;coquetry, and the extreme silliness of her character. "Forewarned, forearmed," would be the laughing reply of Rothschild ; and then, hastening to the lady, he begged her to be as little fascinating as possible, for the abbe believed himself the tutor of his heart and actions still, as in the days of his boyhood. One night Rothschild and Lady Blanche, having re- turned very late from a gay revel, met the private servant of Lord Glenville in the hall, with a face pale as ashes, and his whole body shaking as with an ague fit. His lips could hardly articulate, "My master," and both followed him to Lord Glenville's room.  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7083-00000141"/> 282      LIFE AND ALONE. There, indeed, was the agitation of the servant ex- plained. In the night, all alone, with the exception of this one frightened menial, had the old man met the warning of his last hour. Life was not quite ex- tinct, and hissdim eye resting upon the two who en- tered, he made a sign for them to approach. "It is a more severe attack of his complaint than usual," said Lady Blanche; "and how stupid in Barnes not to send for Dr. Endicott at once I " and she was going to ring the bell, when Rothschild gently de. tained her, saying, - "Lord Glenville evidently wishes to speak to you. A physician's aid would come too late.' The old man took a hand of each, and drawing from his wife's finger the wedding ring, literally gasped forth, - "Rothschild, you will make her a better husband than I did. O, be kind to her." He tried to say something more, and began, "Ida; " but the words died away in a gurgling sound, and in a few moments he had ceased to breathe. Without a word Rothschild drew Lady Blanche away from the sad spectacle, and delivered her to the care of her own maid, and then, returning to the chamber of death, awaited the morning. The next day the mortal remains of Lord Glenville   "FE AND ALONE.       283 had a burial service said over them, and were forwarded immediately to England. Lady Blanche secluded her- self for a few days, after which, in the, richest habili- ments of woe, she glided through her drawing-rooms, greeting a crowd of sympathizing friends. In the mean time Edith Merton had received a small package from Lady Glenville, with the accompanying note:-- "We are in Italy, dear Edith, in this land of song and beauty. How I wish you and Ida were here to go sight-seeing with us! In an artist's room, the other day, I found this little -picture of Middleton, purchased it, and forward it to you, feeling sure it would interest and keep in remembrance your friend. B. GLENVILLE." Edith thought little of the present, but much, of the subject. It seemed to bring her nearer the beggar boy, as she scanned every feature of the picture, looked upon her own home, which had harbored him for a night; and the path leading thence was the one his feet had trod. Could she have known his own hand had labored on that canvas, that the pic- ture had hung for years in his study, -who shall say that a feeling almost of reverence would not have usurped its place in her heart whenever she gazed  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7083-00000142"/> 284       LIFE AND ALONE. upon the gift? As it was, rich thought enough was wasted upon the picture, and a loving fondness, which from its very nature, when exercised, must, and does, always, fall back upon the heart, a leaden weight of cruel disappointment. These deepest emotions of our being are a fearful power to cherish for daily use, when a bark freighted with lighter material would glide. so much more smoothly and securely over life's unquiet waters. Are our harbors here paradise? 'or do angels come down to receive the freight of our hopes and secure their safe keeping unto realization? I trow not. A grave in deep waters, or a treasure heaped upon the sand, scorched and withered up by neglect, - such is the common story of human hopes. Beads of morn- ing strung on slender blades of grass - an hour later, where are they? It is said love wanteth a purity if it ask or seek for a full return. It is rather a thought on a mission to mix, mingle, and deepen, till it sleep- eth on the threshold of life's farewell. Its power to go forth from the heart's secret chamber is the hope of meeting a nature like its own, to grow stronger with, and to become a deathless reality; and lonely the temple that shrouds no divinity, the heart that owneth no love. Thus Edith Merton daily took her old seat upon the floor, beside an open closet door,   "FE, AND ALONE.         285 and in fearless strength, never dreaming of disap- pointment, sent afloat this thought into her future, which time only strengthened and hope deeper col- ored. She lived two lives- the one, all of study and mind, during the day roaming delighted over rich fields of literature; and the other, all heart, enfolding her being from twilight hour until the morning sun broke reverie away, and the student-girl was herself again.  ,  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7083-00000143"/> 286       LIFE AND' ALONE. CHAPTER XVI. THE young Count De Montville, nephew of the baron, and reputed heir of his immense wealth, had returned with wife and children to Naples after an absence of several years, and once more the house of the old baron was filled with gayety. From a simi- larity of taste the young countess and Lady Glenville became fast friends, though the exquisite ladyism of the latter was in strange contrast with the brusque, independent style of the former. Lady Helen Mont- ville was fond of intrigue, and never happier than when aiding acquaintances in that particular line. Although living in the same house, she had never been able to number Rothschild among her admirers, and hated him accordingly. Very soon she made herself mistress of Lady Blanche's views concerning that gen- tleman, and willingly offered her advice in the true spirit of mischief, and what is more - determined on success. During one of their morning conferences- Rothschild, as usual, the theme of discourse--Lady   "FE ANTD ALONE,      287 Helen informed her friend that nothing could so en- hance her charms in Herbert's eye as a noble frank- ness. Mirth lurked in her own as she added,- "Why not throw yourself upon his mercy by an open avowal of attachment, prefaced with an interest- ing story, true or false, of the motives which induced you to become Lady Glenville?" "Ah, Lady Helen I you know not what you ask: I should be only an object of contempt; and more so could he read one page of my real story." "What a simpleton you are for a beauty I! I did not say, tell him the truth, but enough to excite com- passion, and then frankly avow your interest in him. Show what a great amount of confidence you place in him. That will flatter the vanity with which the old abb6 has filled him." "I should think his vanity might be satiated by this time." "Not a bit of it, my dear Blanche. It is the weak point of every man; and the whole history of woman- kind will tell you that we, on the contrary, like those men who pay the least court to our vanity, and are the hardest to win." "But I have not your invention for a story," said Lady Blanche. "That's bad, for through my lips anything about  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7083-00000144"/> aZd      JbLIFEI AND ALUNE. you would meet with very little attention. I confess I dislike your prote'ges, because he has always stood in my husband's way; but you will never gain your hero, let me tell you, unless you play a decisive, bold game, accompanying your story with sufficient tears and regrets; then ask pardon from his fastidiousness, and throw yourself upon that humdrum honor he prizes as he does his mustache." "Helen, why can't you be serious for once?" "Never more so in my life; but Heaven only helps those who help themselves. When your hero comes to-night, let him find you sad; and if you refuse to go out, what can he do but stay and console? But now, adieu. I can afford to wish you a pleasant evening, for I shall shine without a rival." Lady Glenville followed her friend's instructions, and when Rothschild came, he saw at once what an unusually sad manner greeted him. He asked, in his kind, earnest-tone, if even in prospect the gay scene of the evening could not cheer her? "To-night I remain at home,'0 she replied, '"for want of interest in anything or anybody, to nurse my own sad thoughts, until sleep, I trust, will bring forgetfulness." "And am I included in this general ban upon your admirers?" asked Rothschild. "That is optional with yourself."   "FE AND ALONE.       289 "Then I will remain, with your permission ; and may I not add to your pleasure?" "Have I ever expressed anything but pleasure in your society, that you now begin to doubt? But I can promise you only a dull hour in my present mood." "We will try to change that mood." "Impossible," said Lady Blanche. "I am    all wrapped up in self, and for once your power will fail to break the spell." "If self be your theme for thought, I have no wish to. Let me only share the reverie." "What does it matter to you, Rothschild? I am forming a plan to return to England, and our acquaint- ance will end forever, unless - "And she raised her beautiful eyes to his in\ earnest entreaty, as if her lips forbade to speak. Rothschild, pursuing a train of his own thoughts, said, in a half-musing tone, - "Even there we shall meet, and Italy be remem- bered only as the land of our exile." Lady Glenville bowed her head with trembling joy, and a tear found its way from some remote corner of her heart and dropped upon her hand. Rothschild saw the tribute to her sadness, and, with mingled ten- derness and pity, begged her to reveal to him the cause of this most unwonted mood. 19  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7083-00000145"/> 290       LIFE AND ALONE. "What, incur your censure by giving a momentary relief to my sad feelings, when I desire to stand only high in your estimation?" "You astonish me, Lady Blanche. I promise you to be a most lenient judge ; ' and, unconsciously, his tone assumed a new tenderness. "He does. love me I "' was a thought speeding its way with lightning force through her -heart ;, but she answered, with a sad smile, "Do you really mean you will sit here and listen to a long, tedious story?"A; "With pleasure, if it is all about yourself." It was no feigned emotion; a deathly pallor over- spread the features of Lady Glenville for a moment, and then, with a strong effort conquering herself, she began:- "There were but two of us - Edith Merton's mothh- er and myself." Rothschild started at the name; it was sufficient to engage his attention, and he drew nearer the fair speaker. One arm was thrown carelessly over the back of her couch, the other supported his head, and he leaned forward, as if to watch every varying look of a face whose beauty could well bear the scrutiny. How could Lady Blanche but note the deep interest which even the sound of her voice excited I and with flattering hope she went on:-   "FE AND ALONE.       291 "We were sisters in the tie of blood, by name, but never in feeling. Edith was the elder, and from my earliest years exercised an authority over me. By the death of a relative, by whom she was adopted, she inherited a large property, while our parents were in poor circumstances, and soon we were all in a measure dependent upon Edith's generosity. You can readily understand how her word was law to the fam- ily, and she its most important member. When quite young, we went to the same boarding-school, and there she shone without a rival, while her constant derision of my efforts at study and her petty tyranny disheartened me, and made my school-life wretched. She was the favorite of both teachers and pupils, her beauty and talent their constant theme; but for my- self, I can truly say, I entertained but one feeling to- wards her, and that was bitter enmity,- -a feeling she' shared, - though in justice to her I will say, had my will yielded every point to hers, it might have been different, and my dependence upon her created some- thing like affection in her breast for me, because I do not think she ever felt the intense hatred, I did. Her feeling towards me was more of contempt. Home scenes had fostered this most unnatural state of things, school-days strengthened it, after-life completed the wrong. At school my sister-formed an intimate friend-  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7083-00000146"/> 292      LIFE AND ALONE, ship with a girl older than either of us. Her name was Annie Dalton, and through her better influence Edith was induced at least to let me alone. Of very sweet and engaging manners, I too liked this Miss Dalton, not for her wealth or position, but because she saved me from many an insult. You may wonder at my giving you these simple details, but it is neces- sary you should know something of the feelings with which I began life, though I do not plead them as an excuse. Edith's friendship for Annie Dalton led to continued intercourse during vacations, never much approved of by our parents, for the Daltons were an old Catholic family, one of the richest in Florence, and my father was of the English Church, with a hatred of everything Romish. He had quitted Eng- land in order to live cheaper abroad, and Edith, hating the. economy which was daily practised in our home, avoided being there whenever she could. "Annie Dalton resided in Florence. Her home might well be termed a very garden of luxury, and Edith par- doned for- liking it better than the one where nothing but discomfort reigned. We were there together one vacation, and Edward Dalton, the only son, an officer in foreign service, was at home. Notwithstanding my sister's attractions, my beauty won first his heart, and I, who had known but little kindness from any one,   "FE AND ALONE.       293 was perhaps too easily won. I am not going to weary you with a love-tale; in a word, with all the strength of her passionate nature, Edith also loved Edward Dalton, and vowed she would win him from me. An- nie favored her desire, and laughed to scorn the idea that my beauty could really attach such a man as her brother. One thing unfavorable to Edith's project was, that our parents always insisted we should visit together, as if the most loving sisters in the world. While I could boast of but one loyal heart at my feet, Edith had a score of lovers; among those she smiled most favorably upon was an Italian count, even younger than herself- Gonsalvo L'ErchU. His very name was a proverb of wickedness; and' why she should have sported with him thus, and held out hopes to her boy lover, was one -of her wayward moods I had no skill to fathom. He became at length the intimate asso- ciate of Dalton, and together they plunged into every excess of dissipation. Time passed on. Edward and I were engaged, and for once my sister and myself were agreed; it would be best to keep the engage- ment a secret from our parents, for, if known, we should not be allowed to visit Florence again. Now Gonsalvo became a mere tool in Edith's hands. By her arts we were continually thrown together, Dal. ton's jealousy or contempt excited, while Edith, under  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7083-00000147"/> 29 '      LIFE AND ALONE. pretence of soothing, or what not, employed every charm to attach him to herself. AA her suggestion Ithe dissipated Gonsalvo went to my father, and, in a half-drunken state, demanded my hand in marriage, and I was suddenly recalled home, and my sister left in Florence unmolested to play her game. ' Are you weary, Rothschild? Does the story seem foolish to you? Then you have never loved. One word more, of my own fate. Home was intolerable; school no more thought of for me; no news came from Dalton to bid me suffer and hope on. Consider, I was but sixteen years old, and crushed in spirit, and in an evil hour Lord Glenville's eye fell upon pne. He was older than my own father, rich, and high in position; here was an escape offered from the penury and tyranny of home. Despise me not, Rothschild, if I add that my heart craved means wherewith to work a deadly revenge. With this the master motive I married Lord Glenville. Edith, pleading a slight in- disposition, was not present at the wedding; but a letter of congratulation came, filled with the ridicule and sarcasm which ter pen could wield so readily. I' showed it to Lord Glenville. Perhaps, in his weak mind, from that moment dated his dislike for my sister. He soon became master of our household. We were now living in a manner suitable to the rank I had mar-   "FE AND ALONE.     ,  295 ried, and Lord Glenville's first act was to summon Edith to our home. The Daltons were his most bitter enemies - a long story of political griefs, with which you nor I have ought to do. My parents, now living on our bounty, seconded the minutest wish of their son4n-law; but here they were foiled, for Edith ob- stinately refused to become a member of Lord Glen- ville's household, and wrote him such a number of insulting letters, that in their secret hearts I do not think my parents wished it. Three years went by, and I nursed my own misery. Edith remained in Florence, happy; but never, for a moment, did I forget my pur- pose; and when I learned she had been secretly mar- ried to Edward Dalton all these years, I felt my hour had come. I carried the tale to Lord Glenville. There was no hesitancy now. My father, deeply enraged, and incited to act by my husband, both carried mat- ters with a high hand, and effectually separated Edith from her friends, and brought her to our home. Some- times I almost trembled at my work, when I witnessed the proud woe with which she bore her sorrow, and the untiring watch kept upon her movements. Once more Lord Glenville exerted himself in my father's affairs, and we all returned to England. Edith was no better than a prisoner in his power, and she being under age and a Protestant at the time of her mar-  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7083-00000148"/> 296       LIFE AND ALONE. riage, it was declared null and void; and you may imagine the deep hatred with which she viewed her persecutors. Had we remained in Italy, she might have had something of hope to cheer these dark days; but from the day we trod upon English soil, she be- came entirely changed. Despair was written upon her countenance, and, all her energy gone, she seemed to walk and live as in a trance. With all the bright promise of her youth gone, her proud spirit humbled, you will wonder less at Lord Glenville's success in bringing about a marriage between her and an agent of his, named Merton, who lived in IMiddleton,- neither the man nor his home of any account, - and her early history kept a secret. I confess I know not to this day the true reason for Edith's marrying this man, so much beneath her, and only exchanging one martyrdom for another. Still Lord Glenville did not lose sight of her, and on one of his visits to this estate in the country I accompanied him. Edith Mer- ton was an infant in the cradle, and the mother wore the cold, calm look of despair, which never finds relief in expression - a stern and passionless state of being, it feeds upon the life-blood. Her manner towards me was, as ever, contemptuous and overbearing in the extreme. The spirit of her native dignity was in no degree lowered, or her lofty look humbled, by what   "FE AND ALONE.       297 I considered a very low connection. She was a being, apart from all circumstances, alone, neither asking nor giving symrapathy. The very sight of her aroused, in keener anguish, the memory of my wrongs and the loss of all I ever loved. We quarrelled; the ashes of the past were stirred in the heart of each; and, unknown to either, near the open door, at a table engaged with some writing, sat Merton. He heard enough to whet his curiosity, and demanded all. Lord Glenville was greatly incensed with me. It was not that he felt pity for my sister; but he chose to be sole arbiter of her fate, and I heard him mutter words which I never forgot: ' She is, and forever will be, in m y power.' Not long after this visit Lord Glenville disposed of this estate in Middleton to his agent. Changes also took place in our home in England; my mother died, and my father accepted some post in the West Indies. Of the Mertons I heard no more, until my niece in- formed me that Edith Merton was a guest at Melville Castle. At a party there, her black dress told too plainly my sister's fate. Lord Glenville forbade my taking any notice of the child, whatever; but I im- proved his first absence from home to have Edith with me. She had no idea of our relationship. She was to me the exact counterpart of her mother--the same haughty bearing, cold reserve ; and little could I  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7083-00000149"/> 298       LIFE AND ALONE. learn from her of her mother's story. I cannot say I enjoyed the society of the child. Do what I would I could not gain her confidence; her peculiarities and strange deportment only made her mother painfully present to my mind, and an invincible repugnance de- terred me from revealing our relationship. And now, why have I told you this story? Is it because confi- dence is most sweet between those who-" A pause ensued. Rothschild was summoning back the image of that sad woman who, during a few years of his early boyhood, had been so kind to him, had taught him so much that he knew, and on whom he had lavished so much of his power to love. He now understood the suffering of her life, and was lost in a deep reverie. Poor Lady Glenville sat there, imagin- ing every moment his lips would be unsealed, and the tale of love her heart craved to hear would fall upon her anxious ear. The clock struck a late hour, rous- ing them both, and warning him to depart. With a few hurried words of thanks, a kind pressure of the hand, he took his leave; and early morning found the widow, still dressed,- upon the couch, where he had left her. The three remaining hours, ere morning's light heralded in the day, had brought no sleep to her eyelids; and only the one heavy thought pressed upon her breast, "I must have made a mistake."   "FE AND ALONE.       299 The Countess de Montville was her first visitor, and brought the unexpected intelligence that the Abb6 D'Estrand had announced at the breakfast-table that Rothschild had left the city for an indefinite period; and she added, laughing,- What could I think, my dear friend, but that you had sent him from your side a discarded lover? Say, have you plaved me a trick, and what was your mo- tive?" Lady Blanche shook her head, but could throw no light upon the sudden movement. A witness in the box could not be more thoroughly questioned and cross-examined than was Lady Blanche by the count- ess; all to no purpose; she could only glean short, hesitating answers, and left her with a mental ejacu- lation of contempt for her stupidity. "She cannot have refused him," thought Lady Montville; "she is too silly for that, and there is some deeper mystery in it, after all, than I imagined. What if De Montville be right, and the tie between the old baron and the Abbe D'Estrand be one of rela- tionship I Who, then, is Rothschild?

CHAPTER    XVII. IT was the eve of Lady Glenville's departure for England. Wearied and sick at heart, she sat alone amid a few last preparations, then rose and walked through the rooms with all the restlessness attendant upon approaching change. The doorwas softly opened; she looked up, and there stood Rothschild, travel-worn, and covered with dust. What could give him that easy, unconstrained air to so present himself, thought she, but the assurance of a lover? and, holding out her hand, she bade him enter without apology for his appearance. "You see what I am doing," continued she, point- ing to the several trunks and emptied drawers. "It looks very much like departure," said he; " but you go not alone. I have come here thus, and in haste, to learn my fate, to ask--nay, to implore- your leave to accompany you." Her bosom throbbed with wild delight, and she low- ered her head, lest her eyes should flash too clearly   "FE AND ALONE.       301 the joy raging within. He waited for an answer, and permission was given in few words lest the sound of her own voice should chase some gladness from her heart. "You will not withdraw when you know my mo- tive? or do you already surmise it?" asked Roth- schild. Her conscious blush and half-timid glance awoke him instantly to the truth that their thoughts were far dissimilar. At first confounded with surprise, then wishing for her after-peace to save her the knowl- edge of his discovery, he said, quickly,- "Until you know my motive for wishing to accom- pany you to England, I hardly dare seize your kind- ness. I will not detain you long, but you must know from what I do myself, in order to comprehend why the confidence you placed in me when last we met was of such deep interest, and what bearings it has upon my future movements." He led her unresistingly to a seat, and, without waiting any reply, continued: "My boyhood was spent in' Middleton, not far from the home of your own sister; indeed, she was the only person who ever visited the cottage where I lived with a lady of whom I know still less thlan of my own parentage. Mrs. Merton was my instructress, my guide, and constant friend. The only wish she ever denied me was to have Edith, her own little girl,  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7083-00000151"/> 302       LIFE AN D ALONE. come to the cottage with her and be my companion for the long hours she passed shut up with the lady I was taught to call grandmother. One day brought Mr. Merton to the cottage, and his -remark that he would have no idlers on his estate filled me with a boy's passion. My grandma sent me in disguise, as a beggar, to the house, to seek an interview with Mrs. Merton, as weeks had passed, and she had not been near us. There I saw the young Edith, almost for the first time; and as her mother had so strongly prohib- ited my knowing her, the child was enshrined in my heart as a sort of mystery. The greater part of that night was spent in conversation with Mrs. Merton. She informed me I was to quit the country the next day, and that probably she and I would never meet again. To my care she committed Edith, as if a dy- ing request. She was strangely unlike herself, wept much, and mingled with the advice, interrupted by sobs, she attempted to give me, was this constant re- turn to her child: that in after years I should seek, love, and never forget, Edith. Her words took a strange hold upon my)boyish imagination, and became the very germ of the vow I made--that none other than Edith Merton should be my wife. Of my parent- age I can give you but a wild conjecture; the mere fact that it has been hinted to me that I, instead of   "FE AND ALONEo       303 the Count de Mpntville, am the heir of all the Baron de Montville's immense wealth is the basis of that conjecture.' I come now to my request. I appeal to the aunt of her who was my boyhood's dream and is my manhood's desire to possess, I appeal to the sister of the dead mother who blessed our union in prospect, -the sister whose faults are all buried in her grave, -to give me the opportunity to know and-win the hand of Edith Merton. I think she must have cher- ished a memory of me as the beggar boy, and will be willing to look upon me as a suitor for her hand, not- withstanding the mystery which envelops my birth. With your permission, indeed, under your own roof, sanctioned by your approval, would I seek to win her love." j He ceased speaking. Motionless he was bent for- ward, and his eye, most earnest for a reply favorable to his wishes, glowed as with flame into the very heart of his listener. For once in her life, Lady Blanche thought well and rapidly. If Rothschild had fancied he detected her love for himself, how better could she convince him that the past weeks had been mere play- time with her than by granting his request? Wihen married to her own niece, she would possess a hold upon his attentions of which no time could rob her. She could not doubt Rothschild was the beggar boy  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7083-00000152"/> 304:      LIFE AND ALONE. so often falling from Edith's lips; but how could she answer him, to remove every suspicion, when her manner must have betrayed her? By a violent effort she looked him full in the eye, and said, calmly, - "I cannot unsay what I have said of Edith. Her peculiarities prevent my feeling much affection for her; but I will thankfully seize the opportunity to re- pair in some degree the wrong I did, and for what I suffered from her mother I will endeavor to show kind- ness to her child. For that reason, and that alone, I invite you to go with me to England, to make your home at Glenville Castle. Edith Merton shall be sent for, and it will be no fault of mine if she leave there other than your bride." Rothschild was not deceived by her assumed calm- ness; but he admired the effort, and he was not vain enough to deem it would be a very hard struggle for her to changethe nature of her feelings towards him. He poured forth his thanks in terms which flushed the lady's cheek with pride that she had conquered. No painter could throw a truer likeness on 'his canvas than his most skilful words assured her mind that he traced no image of himself thereon, that her one and only thought was Edith. Alone again, Lady Glenville sat as in a trance; tears coursed down her cheeks: the scalding drops aroused her.   "FE AND ALONE.      306 "What " she exclaimed, hastily brushing them away; " shall I weep for the chain again, so lately loosed? How absurd I as if I must weep for want of conquests! Filled with this one idea of Edith, I older than himself, I do not believe he has ever im- agined the extent of my folly." The thought, however, was humiliating; it would bear no dwelling upon. With glad content, Lady Blanche and Rothschild were on their way to England ; both promised themselves they had quitted Italy for- ever, though the abbe prophesied his quondam pupil would soon return, and even the gay Widow be happy enough to come back to freer life in Italy. He di- vined that Rothschild's object was Edith, and he only enjoined it upon him to ask her in marriage honorably of her father, and by no means act out a romance for the pleasure of Lady Glenville. They were gone; and Lady Blanche, finding herself the object of Roth- schild's most devoted attention, and a deep regard for her expressed in every word and look of his, grew to be content under this new state of things, and could even think of Edith with something like satisfaction. As she neared home, thoughts of Ida filled her heart. In conversing upon home matters, she said to her com- panion, -- "I intend Ida to be the wife of Irving Melville, 20  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7083-00000153"/> 306       LIFE AND ALONE. and if he does not take her off my hands, what shall I do with her? She inherits all my beauty,- and the obstinacy of the whole race of Glenvilles. I fear they may take it on themselves to dispose of her." This light, bantering talk about Ida little prepared Rothschild for the graceful beauty which greeted them on arriving at Glenville Castle. Her mother hal not told all the truth, for Ida had even more than her personal beauty, and the difference was, that the young girl's eye was full of beaming light, the mother's soft and tender. Ida's face wore no marble-like repose, but had a speaking power in it of every thought, whether good or bad, and her smile was such as paint- ers would like to have linger on their canvas. Criti- cism was mute before this changing face. One could only look, and half suppress a startled exclamation, and look- and look again. Perhaps the obstinacy re- ferred to was the only reading of her character the mother could arrive at; but, unlike her own, Ida's mind was highly cultivated, and entirely free from the slightest tinge of vanity. She, of all the world, was'unconscious of her rare beauty, or, if conscious, bestowed too little thought upon the fact to make the knowledge observable by others. Unlike her moth- er's, her bearing in soeiy w;ras haughty-ir the ex- treme, and gave admirers to understand she would   "FE AND ALONE.       307 condescend to no hour's flirting; but in the home circle she was brilliant, sparkling, witty, by turns, with all the winning grace of a child's manner, free and bird-like in every movement. She had mirrored out her own destiny, made her own choice, in guarded silence, though, in truth, in accordance with her moth- er's darling wish; and with cold, assumed indifference, whenever the subject was mentioned between them, the proud beauty, with little fear for the future, awaited the result. When Rothschild became their guest, she hailed him with joy, and soon learned to look up to him as to an elder brother. She admired his brilliant qualities, she tried to improve from his hints; but love bade her think only of Irving. His treatment of her had always been half friend, half tutor, as the mood might be; sometimes with the familiarity of a brother, then assuming the Mentor, and both met her gay and scorn- ful mood to hide the deeper feeling and the fearfulness that her secret might be suspected. Of late Irving had thought the character of her beauty changing, and that it had lost some of its attractive grace. Per- haps this was true, in part; for of late, in his pres- ence, the former natural ease of manner seemed to desert   ,!., and she would sometimes sit in painful, embarrassed silence. Lady Blanche would often re- mark, --  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7083-00000154"/> 308       LIFE AND ALONE. "Ida, will the awkwardness of a school-girl never leave you?" and poor Ida's face would crimson frorn the very consciousness of her love. Not for worlds would she have had her mother know she gave the least heed to the project of uniting her with Irving, or that a union with him was, indeed, all the future her young heart craved. Not at all pleased was Ida at the idea that Edith Merton was to become their guest. School days had not furthered their acquaintance of each other, and Ida felt only an increased dislike. The thought was intolerable that they would be thrown together again in her own home, and in no very measured terms she expressed this feel- ing to her mother. "I cannot conceive, mamma, when I have heard you express your dislike of Edith Merton a hundred times, why you should invite her here again, and so urge her coming." "Because it is my pleasure to do it, child." "A very inconsistent one, and deceitful, too, I think." "That is rather a hard judgment to cast upon your mother's conduct." "Well, mamma, then give me a reason to form a better one upon." "What if I am bound, by a promise to Rothschild,   "FE AND ALONE.       309 to invite her here? and more to do all in my power to aid him to win her for a wife?" "Why I I thought he came here for me. What on earth can induce you, mamma, to interest yourself in matrimonial projects for that strange, disagreeable girl, and neglect the welfare of your own daughter I " "{ What nonsense you talk, Ida I I am not match- making, at present, for you, I'll assure you; but lest some school-girl romance should be in your head, and as Rothschild is the only person near you might make yourself absurd about, I give you this timely warning, and say, with my full consent, Edith Merton from this rery castle may marry Herbert Rothschild." "But why should you care, mamma, whom she marries? I think you are perfectly absurd, and this putting me in the background so completely I do not like at all, and for it I will do all I can to thwart your match-making." "And what may that be, Miss Glenville?" "A rival, perhaps," said Ida, laughing. Lady Blanche suddenly turned round, looked ear- nestly upon her, and almost feared, as she met a glance of defiance, that she might have inherited from her that same dark spirit of revenge which had swept the whirlwind across her own life-path; and, wishing to know at once if it were possible the almost child be-  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7083-00000155"/> 1OU       LIFEJ AND ALONE. fore her had conceived a passion for Rothschild, she asked, more in pity than in anger, - "Ida, are you foolish enough to imagine that you could outshine Edith Merton, and win a heart already hers, under the term beggar boy, you have so often heard her make use of? I' "Yes, mamma; I think my share of beauty would entirely eclipse her oddities, my small measure of sense her entire want of common sense." "And what have you," continued her mother, "to offset this life-long feeling for one person? What know you of love? The very word is meaningless to you." The young girl bent low her head to conceal the tell-tale flush she knew was overspreading her face, and answered, - "True, mamma; but there is no telling with what power I might create the feeling, and I could not find a more exquisite subject than the fascinating Roth- schild. At any rate, I'll do what I can; for the very idea of having Edith Merton here is perfectly hateful. Now do give it up, mamma." "You will have to mingle, Miss Glenville, both with the agreeable and disagreeable, and it is none too early for you to learn how to treat all. I need hardly add that I expect every kindness shown to Edith Mer- ton, be your feeling for her what it may."   "FE AND ALUNA.       I1I Then -you will assuredly be disappointed, mamma, for I will not attempt to play the hypocrite in my own home." "Do you know of whom you are speaking, Ida? or to what extent cherishing a feeling of hatred for the simple reason that Edith did not choose to have you for a room-mate at school? Shame on you to con- fess such mean feelings, even if you indulge them!"  "The sin is in the confession, according to your idea, mamma, not in the actual feeling, which we both s ae." "No quibbling, Ida." "No, mamma; but plenty of squabbling, if you ad- here to your deceitful plan of having Edith Merton here. My true feelings, at least, shall govern my con- duct towards your charming guest." "Enough, Ida! If you do not fancy her in that light, what do you say to receiving here and treat- ing properly your own cousin, the child of my dead sister?" "Good Heavens, mamma! what a disclosure t And why did you not tell me so before?"But seeing her mother entirely overcome, and waving her hand to be left alone, Ida quitted the room, muttering, - "A relation will be ten times harder to endure, they expect such overwhelming kindness. O, dear  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7083-00000156"/> 312       LIFE AND ALONE. me! I thought all mysteries had ended with poor papa's death! ' When the subject of the late conversation was again referred to between Ida and her mother, the former pleaded for time to recover from her surprise before Edith should be sent for, and she be obliged to treat her as a cousin, and by innumerable little arts prevented the dread event taking place from day to day. Rothschild said nothing. He had made his wishes known to Lady Glenville, and surely she had a right to choose her own time for promoting them. Lady Blanche had requested Ida to write and invite Edith to the castle; but the young lady flatly refused to do so, and she was forced herself to the most un- welcome task. In her note she did not think it at all necessary to enter into detail. She mentioned a few facts - their relationship, a part of Rothsclhild's story, that relating to her mother, and his interest in her, &amp;:C. She closed with the wish that Edith would con- sider Glenville Castle her home until Mr. Merton might determine otherwise ; and, remembering Edith's peculiarities, or fearing a refusal, at the same time Lady Glenville despatched another letter to Mrs. Ber- trand, enforcing her wish that at the close of the term she desired to receive her niece at Glenville Castle, and then probably her school days would be ended. "   "FE AND ALONE.       313 In the family circle Lady Blanche mentioned what she had done, and almost shuddered, with an indefinite dread of some evil to come, at the strange expression of Ida's face. For the first time in her life she read a look there like her father, and turned pale with the recollection. Recovering herself instantly, she went on speaking of Edith, how soon the term would end, &amp;c. Rothschild's face was beaming, and his glance and smile spoke for the time his thanks. Irving, who happened to be present, heard for the first time the singular revelation of Edith's relationship to Lady Blanche, but only testified his surprise by a shade of deeper melancholy passing over his face. i Ida," said Lady Blanche, as they were about to part for the night, "place yourself, this moment, in Edith Merton's lonely condition; may she not be yearning for a good-night kiss from one who loves her? from the dead mother who is taken away when she needs her most? for some other home in exchange of the barren little room she has occupied for years. Let the contrast between her lot and yours open your heart to receive her kindly, and the tie of blood ever prompt you to remember what is her due." "You have strangely changed of late, mamma. You knew she was your niece when she was here be- fore, and yet you did not make this fuss over her."  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7083-00000157"/> 314      LIFE AND ALONE. "We need not go over that ground again, Ida; I only wish you to empty your mind of all ill will to- wards your cousin." "My cousin I I wish she wan't that," exclaimed Ida, petulantly; "but let me tell you, mamma, Edith Merton is above receiving any attention from me, and her indifference will best suggest to me the way I shall treat her."   "FE AND ALONE.       315 CHAPTER     XVIII. "ATE one night Edith Merton entered her chamber, after the fatiguing exercises of an examination day. Brilliant, indeed, was her winding up of this term; no one had dared compete with, her in study; there- fore the bestowal of the highest prize to her hurt no one's feelings. Gratitude demanded nothing of sacri- fice on her part, and every voice was loud in her praises. There was only silence after her music; and amid no murmur, even of applause, as usual, she glided from the room. Nearly nine years she had been a pupil of Mrs. Bertrand, and but one girl there had ever made her wish that her mother had placed no ban upon her forming friendships. To-night the weight of loneliness pressed heavily upon her heart. Study was but a cold and cheerless companion for all the bright hours of life; they required a living sym- pathy, not one found in far-reaching thought or lofty aspiration. A book was a drear supply for the name of friend, and its leaves had often been damped with  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7083-00000158"/> 316       LIFE AND ALONE. tears, and long-drawn sighs travelled over many, a page. True, there was enough beauty of literature to revel in, and power therein to draw one out of self; but the poet's dream, or the fascinating page of prose would as often force back Edith's thought upon herself. Thus it was with a sadder feeling than usual that she took her old seat upon the floor that night, and gave vent to aching thoughts in passionate words. "Whither tends my fate,? The course of instruc- tion here, they tell me, I have finished. I have said' my last lesson. School days have ended; but Clara is dead! O, why do I feel so wretched? Hard tasks are over; new scenes await me; the ban is removed, and all the sweets of friendship may be mine. Alas I I feel the truth. The power of affection is chilled within me. I cannot win friends. An ice bolt clogs my heart, and it is too late to mould character anew. A heart so long dead to sympathy shrinks now at the strangeness of the word; and this is life - the life, at least, I know. Youth has gone down the dark stream; and what is left me? Strength to suffer and endure. Shame on my repinings I There is left me a strength to do battle, and be conqueror, whatever the future. I am conscious of it, as well as I remember the voice which uttered ' Edith' once., Owe I no gratitude for   "FE AND ALONE.       317 the life-long conviction that my destiny will become one with the beggar boy's, and that my soul has never been harassed with a doubt of it? Wherever I go, that thought will be with me-my hope, my joy, enough of happiness. And can I find no pleas- ure in the fact that I have kept my mother's com- mand? Nay, it is a glad thought, and Clara has borne it upwards unto her. How strange home will seem without my mother's presence I And the cot- tage in the wood-I must supply her place to the lone woman there. There is a low mound of earth- I may visit and moisten with tears the sod which cvers my mother." The first morning of freedom from school and all its restrictions broke for the lone girl. A servant handed in two letters, one with the seal broken, di- rected to Mrs. Bertrand,--both in the same hand- writing, - and the other was her own, sealed. She read the one addressed to Mrs. Bertrand first, and sat motionless from, surprise. "Am I awake'? Lady Glenville the sister of my mother! Who would have dreamed it?   And now she has a claim upon me. I am forced to obey her wishes, and every feeling of dislike must be banished for the sake of the dead. I dare not cherish the memory of my mother, and feel a repugnance towards  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7083-00000159"/> 318      -LIFE AND ALONE. her living sister." Next every little circumstance of her visit to Glenville Castle was recalled, until she was aroused from her reverie by Mrs. Bertrand's en- trance. "I have come to rejoice with you, my child. Are you not as happy as can be?" "Ought I to be so very happy?" And why not, my dear?" "I suppose surprise at the revelation has, rather unfitted me to rejoice; and, Mrs. Bertrand, do you think I ought to go there at once?" "Unless you have some very good reason, my dear, for a refusal; and if so, do not hesitate to con- fide it to me. I may be a better judge than yourself in this instance." "I have no reason, madam, but is it wrong to wish otherwise?" "I do not understand you, my love." Poor woman I these had been her stereotyped words for years. "And I do not understand myself," said Edith, smil- ing; "but I had always imagined pleasurable emo- tions to be easily defined, and these I now experience bear a strong resemblance to old thoughts of sorrow." "I fear, my dear, you cherish rather gloomy feel- ings of life; and this prevents your realizing the im-   "FE, AND ALONE.      319 mense advantage of this late-acknowledged relation- ship - the home your aunt offers you, the society you will mingle in, and which you are so well fitted to adorn. I can anticipate for you only the most bril- liant future. But your own letter is unopened; I dare say that is filled with affection which will better recon- cile you to the change in your prospects than any words of mine. I will leave you to read it;" and the good woman took herself away, while Edith felt grateful for the interest she expressed, but could not view the matter in the same light. With wandering thoughts she began to read her aunt's epistle. An hour went by. Again and again had some one knocked at her door, and no answer was returned. Then came back Mrs. Bertrand; but thinking Edith might be asleep, she did not attempt to enter. Edith sleep on the threshold of her happi- ness? Another day and she and Rothschild would meet. a"My God, I thank thee!" were the first words she spoke. "Thou hast deigned to bless richly an earthly love. I would recognize henceforth and for- ever an overruling Providence. Youth-is not wasted, no hour of reverie lost, for the shadows are chased away by the coming break of day. The beggar boy and the man I I know now what an intensity of hap-  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7083-00000160"/> 320      LIFE AND ALONE. piness the human heart may bear. What other per- sons have meted out to them for life in daily measure, I have concentrated in this one realization. The beg- gar boy and I shall meet again, to know no separation on earth. One more sleep on that well-remembered sound, and then his voice to greet my ear in long en- joyment. O, this moment must be what the world calls bliss i Life, but not alone. To-day hope, to- morrow completion 1 My mother, surely from thy seat in glory thou beholdest the joy of thy child, and art satisfied with her measure of happiness. Wert thou not missioned to bring about this event? Who denies there is such a thing on earth as unalloyed pleasure? And what will our meeting be? No mat- ter; the present is too sufficient to be charged with the future. But where is my boasted self-control? Stop, my heart, this beating. No excess of joy shall whirl me heedless through a mighty change. Disci- pline even now must do its work, and this pastime of my mind be short, lest I lose all consciousness in one overwhelming sense of joy." And she did control her thoughts, and with a re- stored outer calmness she sought Mrs. Bertrand. But her power could not quench the raging bliss within her heart, and it shone through the deep- sunken eye, kindling a beauty never lighted there be-   "FE AND ALONE.       321 fore. The sallow hue, as if by magic, had fled her face, and in its stead was the warm glow of a restored youth. Smiles played around those lips, ever so firm and compressed, and her step was no longer the mea- sured tread of a weary mind. Mrs. Bertrand noted the change, and thought to herself, "She is strangely beautiful, and her beauty will be lasting because all of intellect." These last few hours she spent with her pupil were fraught with an undying interest. The long barrier of reserve and coldness melted away-- the quiet girl suddenly emerged into the confiding, sympathizing friend. The separation which followed was painful to both; and Edith's last words of affec- tionate gratitude, so unexpected and delightful, left a precious memory of her enshrined in the teacher's heart. They parted forever. No pupil in coming time ever bore the slightest resemblance to that scholar of genius Mrs. Bertrand felt that never again could the soul of true music float through her hall, or one drink with her from the fountain of all knowledge such copious draughts. At last the very name of Edith Merton in her school became an unusual sound, or the whisper of some mystery more and more vague, as handed down by an old to a new scholar, while, strange to say, the praises of Clara Melville seemed never to die away. 21  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7083-00000161"/> 322       LIFE AND ALONE. With a maid, in Lady Glenville's carriage, Edith journeyed her way to the castle. She must pass by Lord Melville's, and there she made a short stay. Only Gerard was at home. As she bade him good by, with all her old gay freedom of manner, she re- marked, -- {' Only think, Gerard, I go to Glenville Castle, niece to its mistress. Never breathe one word what I told you of its gloom. I am to see only sunshine in its tomb-like rooms, and view everything under a differ- ent aspect." "Then why not stay here a while first?" inquired Gerard, eagerly. "How stupid I Have I not told you, Lady Blanche is my mother's own and only sister? and I must hasten that her affection may have fair play; besides, Kate Mellan would die of envy if I were to remain here and breathe the air she pants for. So adieu, and let me see you every day-- every other day, I mean." She did not reach Lady Blanche's until the family, tired of waiting for her, had seated themselves at the dinner-table. They were four in number, Lady Blanche, with Irving opposite her, on one side Roth- schild, and Ida beside him. Opposite the former was an unoccupied seat. "Mamma," exclaimed Ida, " do you think any acci-   "E AND ALONE.       323 dent has happened to Miss Merton? or that it would have been too much like the common order of events had she arrived in due time two hours ago?" Before her mother could reply, the door was opened, and, as if domesticated there for months, the subject of Ida's remark entered. With a haughtiness of manner perfectly natural, but in marked contrast to the well-assumed cordiality of her aunt, Edith took the proffered hand. With Ida a cold bow was ex- changed, and to Irving she scarcely bent her head. Then, as her glance rested upon Rothschild, self-pos- session seemed deserting her; but not then or there must emotion be shown, was the instant thought, and it was for him, not her, to show any token of recog- nition. Ida took it upon herself to introduce the two, and in so peculiar a tone that her mother's face flushed with anger. Edith did not even acknowledge the acto Lady Blanche said something about pleasure at having Edith again with her; and in her reply, Rothschild listened for the first time to the sound of a voice he hoped to create all of-joy for him. Its tone was very peculiar, and seemed to convey a mean- ing, as well as the words she uttered. "I had a letter from Lady Melville, urging, almost insisting, I should go there; and knowing little of the claim of kindred, I took Mrs. Berttand's advice, and accepted your kind offer."  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7083-00000162"/> 324      LIFE AND ALONE. "We shall try to make you happy, my dear Edith; though I suspect you retain but a gloomy remem- brance of this place." "Melville Castle has likewise sad associations for me," answered Edith. Irving saw the tears gathering in her eye, and knew she was thinking of Clara. After the uncom- fortable meal was finished, he drew her arm within his own, and led her into a small room adjoining the parlor. "You will not fear to be alone with me one mo- ment," said he, in his deep, saddest tone; "for I have a duty to perform, a forgiveness to ask, and a regard to plead for - less passionate than one of- old, but sincere and true as the memory I cherish of the dead.' Again that look of surpassing beauty stole over his face, which, at a glance, Edith had discovered was the reigning character of Rothschild's countenance, and their strong resemblance, for the moment, perhaps, made her gracious, for she bade him speak on. "Our thoughts, Edith, concerning the past are simi- lar. I now view my conduct in the light you ever did; but I wear upon my heart a written token of forgiveness from her now dead; and may I not hear from your own lips the same in words? Mistake not   "FE AND ALONE.       325 my motives. I could neithefrappreciate nor desire now what once I craved of you. As a lover I can never appeal to any woman. For the sake of her who loved you and myself, I entreat your forgiveness for the perfidy she forgave ;" and Edith's answer was, - "The friendship I would have given to Clara, were she living, is yours. You need not ask my forgiveness for the wrong done her, and we will never refer again to your short-lived madness. Our friendship will be lasting as our love for the memory of Clara." A weight was lifted from Irving's breast, and hours passed in sweet converse of one much loved ere they two reentered the parlor. Several guests were as- sembled, and most joyous seemed the mood of all. Edith might- have felt a pang of disappointment that through the long evening Rothschild never sought her side, nor addressed a single word to her. Ida claimed his whole attention, and finally drew him into an adjoining room to finish a poem he had been read- ing aloud to her. Edith, sitting apart by herself, feasted upon the distant sound of his voice, and tried to imagine it sufficient of bliss. Ida being obstinate, as usual, Lady Blanche was forced to 'ask Edith for music; but she pleaded fatigue, and very soon re- tired to her own room. Had it been her wont to go to rest without self-examination as well as reverie,  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7083-00000163"/> 326       LIFE AND ALONE. she would this night have prepared for sleep with only an undefined feeling of depression. But not so. She began to unravel thought, and first recalled to mind her prayer to God, its expressions of thankful- ness when she had learned that Rothschild and the beggar boy were the same. "Ah, yes," said she, "there was the sin. True worship of God admits no earthly idol, and disap- pointment awaits every hope which shuts out heaven, and grasps too much of earth. I had seized hold of one of the slender but golden threads with which Hope binds her victim to earth, and it has not ledme to all it promised. Perhaps to-morrow will be differ- ent. Perhaps he is disappointed in my appearance, and prefers Ida's beauty. No; for I can offer him a love in comparison with which beauty shall vanish as dew-drops in the sun. How he looks, too, as when a boy!l only now there is the bearing of one who owns a distinguished name, and his voice and his manner, to others, at least, are just the same I have dreamed about all these years." A quick rap at the door startled her from her reverie, and Ida entered. "Mamma sent me to bid good night, and ask if all was comfortable." Then throwing herself into a chair, she went on: "Are you glad you have left school? and what do you think of mamma's attache? Hand- some of course, but what more?"   "FE AND ALONE.       327 ' Nothing more," answered Edith; " and I am tired, but very comfortable." "Well, Rothschild will feel flattered, I think. I will tell him what you say, as an extinguisher to a superabundant quantity of self-esteem." "Your report will be, then, I said nothing of him." "Do you prefer Irving?"asked Ida. "I believe I am too sleepy to enter upon their re- spective merits to-night." "A gentle hint for me to be gone. Mamma told me to make myself agreeable, and I thought I was." "I will answer you, then, as it regards Irving," said Edith. "If I had thought or cared to win his love, I should only be indulging a folly now, and in- curring much mortification for myself hereafter." The shaft struck home, and with crimsoned cheek Ida hastily bade good night. She returned to the parlor. "I have a message for you, Herbert, from Edith." "Ida," interrupted her mother, " we know the young lady too well to credit your nonsense. Edith has sent no message by you, and I can hardly endure your school-girl jests. Rothschild, I believe you spoil her. Do, Irving, give her a few ideas of pro- ' priety."  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7083-00000164"/> 328       LIFE AND ALONE. "Why, mamma, Jhow very shocking   Let him keep the few he has for his own benefit." "Why do I deserve such a severe remark, Miss Ida?" "O, you have done nothing whatever. Any notice from you to my unworthy self would be 'casting sour pearls,' &amp;c. - you know." "Do you mean to say, not a thought I might com- municate would be of service to you, Miss Ida?" "Yes, and more than that; for we should only prove how you would fail, to interest me, brilliant as they say you are in conversation." "I feared as much," said Irving, smiling, " and that is the reason I have not intruded upon-you this evening; but now your frankness promises a pleasant chat. What shall we talk about?" "Propriety," said Ida, demurely. But she had gained his attention, and forgetful of Edith's warning, the poor child sat for the next half hour hanging in rapt delight upon every word he uttered. Rothschild was forgotten, and her whole soul engaged to seize, if possible, some phrase of double meaning with which to feed her craving heart. When they separated for the night, she exclaimed, - "I think mamma must be satisfied at the propriety with which I have listened to you, interrupting only   "FE AND ALONE.       329 with my eyes; and to-morrow she will beg you to give me a few hints upon the sin of obstinacy, which she says forms the sterling worth of the Glenville tribe; and, mamma, when the pious Irving shall have rooted up every wrong in my character, what then?" Lady Blanche blushed consciousness, and Ida, wish- ing to convince Irving she was no participator in her mother's scheme of uniting them, added, saucily, "{ I will answer for you, mamma. You will then procure  a husband for me, as you have done for Edith; and I shall just show you and my tutor, that obstinacy is a plant of indigenous birth, and nothing but love can eradicate it." "I am ashamed of you, Ida," said Lady Blanche. "] Then will you learn to speak discreetly? I have taken you too early from school, and you are not fit for society." "I Marriage you mean, mamma. I am perfectly ele- gant in society." If there was victory in the last word, Ida usually came off conqueror, but could eyes have followed her into the seclusion of her own chamber, they would have witnessed nothing of triumph in her. "O, I am weary, weary, weary I " she exclaimed. "tow weak and foolish mamma is I I don't know ex- actly what I want, but Irving's love, I suppose, would  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7083-00000165"/> 330       LIFE AND ALONE. decide that question perfectly. I suppose, in the end, he will take me; but two long years remain to travel this same dreary round, to watch his every glance, and thirst for more. What can I amuse myself with in the mean time? interrupting Edith's love passages? No; I half suspect she knows my secret, and could pay me back with - interest. Well, I will be as trou- blesome as I can to everybody, and there may, perhaps, be some fun in it." With which laudable resolution the young beauty sought her pillow, and her slumbers were very light, as if sporting with the threads of care which thus early had begun to do their work. Ah, youth, youth hath strange designs in its keep- ing, and the glow of life's morning may be bright with its sunshine and dew - the one but the seeming of light, and the other but the tear of the heart.   "FE AND ALONE.       331 CHAPTER    XIX. DAY after day passed, and there was no change in Rothschild's manner towards Edith, nor any advance toward intimacy. Nothing like conversation ever passed between them; even weeks went by, and Lady Glenville began to wonder and to fear that the gloom of the castle had -rendered all alike dull. She exerted herself, and very soon the house was filled with pleas- ant people; but Rothschild and Edith were brought no nearer together. The observance of what Ida termed a melancholy courtship was unheeded by the guests, and even she herself made but few remarks, being so entirely engrossed with Irving. Edith sought solitude as much as possible, to nerve herself for a duty she felt pressing heavily its claim. True, she never had appeared to so little advantage, sitting apart, and, though unembarrassed, yet taking no por- tion of 'the entertainment upon herself. The desire so often expressed to hear her sing she constantly refused, and seemed to repel all overtures made for her  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7083-00000166"/> 332       LIFE AND ALONE. acquaintance. With Irving her manner would change in an instant; the two, in pleasant chat, would some- times sit together, watched with a jealous eye by Ida, and often listened to by numbers of the visitors, in pleased surprise at powers of conversation so well matched. If, perchance, Rothschild, attracted from a distant part of the room by novel and enthusiastic ex- pressions from Edith, drew near, his approach was the sure chill to her charm, and the signal for a relapse into her usual unsocial mood. At an early hour she would quit the parlor, because of intense mental suf- fering, and, at length, becoming fully conscious that by this kind of life she was allowing her mind to rust, she determined to become the conqueror of her own waywardness. Thus she reasoned :- "I have loved from childhood with one wild thought. Shall I now, by apparent gloom, sue for pity for this waste of years, for what the world would term my mental disease? No; talent and its cultivation shall save me from contempt. I will meet wretchedness with the same strength I welcomed joy. Thank Heaven, there is nothing strong enough to make cap- tive the will! If its freedom be stamped on every page of Scripture, life proves it day by day." For an instant the simple faith of her childhood came back to her in the form of a question: "Would   "FE AND ALONE.--      333 not my desire be realized, if, in prayer, I petitioned Heaven's aid, and firmly believed?" Then came the doubt for answer: "It cannot be that the Almighty would grant his aid and blessing, when the heart has, as it were, taken destiny into its own guidance. No; the pure language of faith is in a different spirit. 'Thy will be done' means sacrifice. Then let the blow come. Let life's woven tissue of hope be rent; let it be swept away as a mist of the morning. The past has a beauty which, at least, the future may trail as a shadow. One short struggle, and I will utter, 'with all the chill of truth, ' Life and alone.'  And she did utter "life and alone," but with the wild energy of despair; and, clasping her hands upon. her breast, she hung breathless upon those little words of mighty meaning, sounding deep through her very being. Thus early in life the death knell of hope rang out the words, "Life and alone." So let it be. The weakness was past. Reconciled with the world and herself, with the iron in her soul, the smile upon her lip, she sought the gay company below. Amid a laughing group, a youthful figure, shrouded in black garb in unison with hidden woe, glided into their midst, and there was heard a novel peal of laughter, - a sound unheard before, -and a foreign tone mingled with those voices attuned to mirth. It came from  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7083-00000167"/> 834       LIFE- AND ALONE. Edith Merton, and she stood beside Rothschild, with her eye bent full upon him in calm and proud indiffer- ence. To some remark he made, her keener wit called forth a louder peal of mirth, and the spell of that evening to create most enjoyment was the power of a heart-stricken girl. No pang of self-torture ban- ished for a moment her smile or her grace. No bitter sarcasm gave even the far-seeing Irving a glimpse of the mouldering ashes upon a life-long love. Neither did curling lip nor scornful expression repel the least interesting of those who crowded around her. Again music was proposed, and all looked towards her. She turned to Rothschild, and said, - "Can you not be spokesman for these bright eyes which look desire for music, and beg Ida or Miss Mel- lan to oblige them?" Hope almost sprang up again in her heart, as he bent his first glance of love upon her-so full, so soft, so tenderly earnest; but she crushed the tiny spark even while he answered, - -"My own desire to hear you sing is too strong for me to attempt to plead elsewhere." Edith laughed, and replied, - "Too skilfully drawn out to satisfy my idea of per- fect sincerity; but, however, when good-night time comes, the task shall be mine to say it unto you all in music."   "FE AND ALONE.       335 Ida and Kate Mellan both, when urged to play, chose to refuse; and their example being followed by others, Edith began tuning her harp, saying, - "No great compliment to urge me in this way. As I have just remarked, my attempt will be a good- night song." "Prolong the ceremony then," interrupted Irving. "What I give length of sound and words to part- ing?" "Rothschild, do join Edith in singing," suggested Lady Blanche. "With pleasure, if Miss Merton will take a song I am familiar with." "M1iss AMerton prefers to sing alone, and that her good night may be given without response as the hour is still early," said Edith. Seven times she swept her hands hurriedly across the strings of her harp, and each time swifter than before, with a light and skilful touch; then hushed the instrument, and seven times with thrilling power, and each in different language, her voice, pealed forth, "Good night. ' The unnatural loud notes startled all the company, but their perfect melody as well aston- ished them. Then followed a good-night chant in each of the several languages, in strict unison with national character,--the grave, the gay, the warlike, the peace-  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7083-00000168"/> 336       LIFE AND ALONE. ful, the half-cultured, and the most refined. There were strains of bitterness mingled with the Greek and Roman chant, as if her good night in that tongue em- braced a departed glory; the Italian wrapped the soul in bliss, and bade lovers remember their vows; in wild glee her chanson revealed a bright to-morrow; and graver, with more of passion, sounded the Span- ish verse; dirge-like the German; and in her native English she sang as if, with effort, was controlled the betrayal of too much feeling. Was it magic to pro- duce, as her voice died away to the faintest murmur of a sound, an oppressive weight upon every heartY like the pall of darkness night flings over earth? And it seemed as if the pale empress of the night withdrew her reign, as Edith glided silently from the room. All the guests separated, though the hour was early. Good night fell simultaneously from every lip. Even Lady Blanche and Ida uttered it, forgetful to pro- long enjoyment, and eager only to speed withdrawal, as if commissioned so to do by some unseen but pow- erfully felt influence. "Mamma," said Ida, following her mother to her room, 'if you wish aught but a direful calamity to fall upon this house, don't have any more of Edith Merton's unearthly screaming. I know she has power to evoke evil, and Kate says there seems a spectre   *LIFE AND ALONE.     - 33 following her in night-gown an-d cap, groaning out, ' Good night.' I am sure I feel as if I had parted with somebody forever." "There was a strange effect, certainly," mused Lady Blanche aloud. "Strange, mamma! You should have seen Irving's face; you would have thought madness was working on his brain, and suicide about to follow." "And how did Rothschild appear?" asked her mother. "Like an owl, who sees clearest in the night-in- terested for once, and drinking in every sound, as if his soul was thirsty." "Pleased, -do you mean, child?" "In love, you mean, mamma." "Well, did he seem to be any in love with Edith?" "I do not know what love is, mamma." "How foolish, Ida I Did he appear to be fascinated with her and her singing?" , "I don't know; he looked at me all the time." "You should have sung, Ida, and thus prevented the unpleasant termination of the evening." "Not when called upon by Edith Mertob, to give greater Mclat to her own powers." "What, jealous still, Ida? and of one so greatly your superior?" 22,  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7083-00000169"/> 338      LIFE AND ALONE. "You are always harping, mamma, on the wide difference in us--quite a good method to excite jealousy." "Well I may, child. I have suffered and known the wide difference between a merely physical beauty and the intellectual, flashing the eye and irradiating the face." "We all have mind, mamma, as well as Edith Mer- ton; though you make me out often little better. than a calf." "How absurd, Ida I Go to bed, and another night, when asked for music, be more obliging." "Thank you, mamma, for not saying, Good night. I shall never want to hear the words again. I pro- posed to Irving that we should ask from Edith a good morning song on the morrow,- for a revival of hope; and his horrid answer was, 'Mortals cannot bear upon earth the gladness of a resurrection morning.' I declare his very look haunts me. Mamma, do you think he is at all deranged?" "I think it more probable you lack both wit and sense. Let me hear no more; I am weary." "I should not wonder if I did become insane," thought Ida, as she went to her chamber, and sat up half the night, thinking, with an aching brain, what she could do, on her part, to accomplish her heart's   "FE AND ALONE.       339 purpose. The following evening Edith had again shrunk into herself. She pleaded a slight headache, and sat down alone in a retired part of the room. She had barricaded herself with a small table, and, with her head leaning on her hand, she bent over a book of poems, absorbed, as it were, in reading. A step drew near; she did not raise her eyes until Roth- schild's voice inquired what book thus claimed her interest. Then glancing his eye upon the page, he perceived it to be a volume of his own poems but just published in England. Edith was about to re- ply, when she discovered the book was upside down, and bursting into a merry laugh, she exclaimed, - "I am doing a critic's justice to your work, and trying to read it upside down." "As you have read me," said Rothschild, making room for himself by her side; and then he whispered faint and low, "Edith!" She raised her eyes to his. There is a look which woman gives to man; it is his to seize and know he is beloved. The barrier of cold reserve melted away between them, and his next question, "Edith, do you remember the beggar boy?" proved how visionary had been her fancied control over old thoughts. "Say but yes. That is all I will ask now here in this gay crowd." But he waited in vain for that little word of such a  mighty meaning. He continued:--  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7083-00000170"/> n %40     LIFE AND ALONE; "Have I then, by the rash presumption with which I traced out a course of conduct, lost what to gain I would stake everything in my life? You had been represented to me as strange and unlike your sex. Can you not pardon the test to which I put the false- hood? My indifference was assumed to mark its effect upon your character. The pride and cool con- tempt you have shown proved to me that, with true woman's dignity, you would be sought to be won. I fancied to pursue any other course would be to give myself blindly up to love's power,-a weakness which you would despise, -and that before I had appreciated half your worth. This is my excuse; and it was no easy matter, I'll assure you, thus to do vi- olence to my own feelings. The second day we ware together, no doubt of you was to be resolved in my own mind; but I would prevent even the shadow of one resting in yours concerning my love." Then, again, with an earnestness which was fast attracting observation, he repeated his question. "I do remember the beggar boy," said Edith, has- tily nrising from her seat, and, passing by him, she mingled with the company. Irving accosted her:-- "And what do you think, Edith, to be the happiest moment of our lives? For here am I appealed to, as if my hair was whitened with the experience of age.   "FE AND ALONE.       341' In sweet compassion help me out. What shall I ' say?" { When we give for the asking," maliciously inter- rupted Kate Mellan, who had been watching Edith and Rothschild. "And why not, then,'- said Ida, suddenly stepping forward to the relief of Edith's momentary embarrass- ment, "if there is such happiness in giving for the asking, why not a greater in giving unasked? Does it merit the contempt it always meets?" No one seemed to understand her. All merely thought it was a kind endeavor to draw  attention from her cousin. But Edith thought that Ida had hoped to draw an answer from Irving, and for a moment had forgotten herself.' She looked at the strangely excited girl, and feared' for her a worse ex- posure at no distant time. She pitied the love-sick child, for she saw there would be strength wanting to bear the certain disappointment. But what could be done?  To carry the tale to Irving would avail noth- ing for Ida; to expose her to her mother would be worse than his pity. A thought flashed through her mind: she herself would try and win her confidence. That same night Edith followed Ida to her room, and, taking no notice of her cousin's look of amazement, thus addressed her:  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7083-00000171"/> 342      LIFE AND ALONE. "Once, Ida, you sought to be my companion at school. I refused you because of a promise made my mother to avoid all intimacies. Now I have come here to sue for your friendship; and can you be magnani- mous enough -to forgive a fancied slight, and under- take the hard task of learning to love me?" "I am less worthy," answered Ida, "to be loved than I was in my school days; and, besides, I did all I could to prevent your coming here. But mamma would have it so." "It was very natural you should, Ida, for I had never made myself the least agreeable to you." There was a silence of a few moments, and then Ida, blushing crimson, said,- "You will withdraw your request when you know me better." "Never,' replied Edith. "It is not made lightly, and you are the first from whom I ever craved the boon.' "How strange, Edith I Well, I need a friend, and they say confidence begets love. Read that. Know, if it fails, I am prepared to go any length, and then see if you think me worthy of your friendship." Edith read an open letter she handed her, and any- one but herself would have smiled at its contents. It was a disclosure of every feeling of her heart which   "FE AND ALONE.       343 Ida had written to Irving. Edith calmly read it through, tore the sheet to atoms, and asked if it was written at the suggestion of Kate Mellan. "No; I will acquit Kate. She does not suspect my love for Irving. The deed was wholly my own." Tears of mortification freely flowed. She had writ- ten the letter days previous, and kept it by her; but intended that night to forward it by her own maid. Edith's entrance had prevented, and, hardly knowing what she was about, Ida had handed it to her to read, and now was only conscious of shame. "You need not shed a tear, dear Ida. It is no dis- grace to love Irving Melville; you are saved the act which would have distanced you from his side forever. You will never think of it again, when I tell you, in confidence, that I - whom he once pretended to -love --could not, if I would, win him from the memory of the dead." Ida raised her eyes, and looking Edith full in the face, exclaimed, -  - "Can you stoop to deception? Kate Mellan told me she overheard him offer himself to you the very evening of the day you came here." "Tis false as false can be. I remember the con- versation of that evening, and his remark that I need not fear to be alone with him, for he had no love to  &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7083-00000172"/> 344      LIFE AND ALONE. offer me or any other woman. Your secret is safe with me; and now let me see you struggle to look boldly on the truth I swear unto you: Irving Melville will never marry. So do not cherish feelings which will only weaken your mind, and be to you a source of lasting mortification." "But I thought he loved you, Edith." "And he has told me he did not. The dead is your rival, Ida, and you are working against an unseen but powerful influence, which can never be overcome." "But, Edith, how I have hated you I " "That was because you thought Irving loved me; there will be no cause for enmity between us now." "You are right, Edith, and I shall always love you 'for saving me from the committal of a most disgrace- ful act; but you will not despise me?" "No, indeed. We all err in one form or another, and it is only the known continuance in wrong doing which merits a particle of contempt. You will strive to look upon Irving only as a friend whose esteem you would possess and keep always, remembering that in joy or in sorrow you shall also have a place in my healrt." She bent forward and pressed a first kiss on her young relative's brow, which was warmly returned, and left her with a sweet feeling of peace. Lady   "FE AND ALONE.       345' Glenville, in silent bewilderment, noted a change in the two cousins, and only hoped it would last. She still cherished the idea that Ida should become Ir- ving's wife; but her daughter now entertained no such views. Bravely overcoming the past, and all forgetful of self, she experienced a new joy in talking with him, and by her perfectly unembarrassed manner convinced Edith that she had gained the victory over olden feelings. Rothschild and Edith sat alone together in the library; perhaps it was the one room in the house less frequented, or the similar taste of the two drew them thither. He took a seat by her side, and again and more fully he explained the reasons for his ap- parent neglect, and received the pardon he sued for. Now he pleaded the love he had borne her for years; he dwelt long on the cherished idea that her mother had sanctioned that love by committing her so sol- emnly to his charge; he pleaded that- the memory they had both cherished of each other might prevent a long period of engagement, and that to become ac- quainted should be the long, sweet pleasure of life. They had always known one another by a mystery which their union would disperse. Of their future he spoke with the confident tone of one knowing that the depth of his love could shield her from every sor-  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7083-00000173"/> 346       LIFE AND ALONE. row, or share those -ills no human power could avert. Edith Merton might be pardoned if she listened, in long silence, to the language of her own thoughts, spoken in deep, passionate earnestness, by the voice which had uttered her name in childhood, and sound- ed the one glad note through the loneliness of her very being for so many long years. And she did listen thus long; but Rothschild read, in the half- veiled light of her soul-lit eye, that she was silent not from doubt of his words, or of her own heart's con- sent; and when he begged again and again for answer in words, his heart was fully satisfied with her simple story of one engrossing thought of him. And she ended with, - "Herbert, I have waited upon the threshold of a mighty happiness, seen the mists clear away, and have entered within the vail. What more has life to offer?" He folded her to his breast, and exclaimed, - "Even years, I trust, dear Edith, within the sanc- tuary of a holy love, pure as it is deathless in its nature." "But does Heaven grant such bliss to mortals?" inquired she; and he felt her frame tremble in his em- brace. "Even so, dear Edith; for ours is a joy to travel   "FE AND ALONE.       347 onward and upward until its immortality be crowned in heaven." Who shall say that life hath no moment of unal- loyed bliss? What thought had Edith Merton to mar the deep enjoyment of that hour? And for what fu- ture would not its life-long memory compensate? Let the clouds gather and the storms of life break in fury over her head, let her pathway be strewn with the wreck of the past, let "life and alone " be the wail of her anguished spirit, -think you not, that memory could fly back with lightning speed to the hour when she gave and received all that was saved of happiness for mankind when Heaven blasted para- dise? In the heaviest misfortune which could black- en her day, this hour of intense delight was secure to her. It has passed. If reason were to be ever de- throned, some interval of consciousness must send her mind back to this hour when life's dream was realized, and fling over the future some gleam of its brightness. And yet their love was not idolatry, or Rothschild had never dared to bear her thoughts with his upward into the presence of the King eternal, and spoken of the 'hour when together they might worship at his throne. It was not all of time they thought; both fullv realized that as two travellers they had met, and, merging into one their interests, hopes, and fears, had,  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7083-00000174"/> 48o       LIFE AND ALONE. started upon a journey: They found that unity of thought, love's essence, that creative harmony of two natures commingling into one. They experienced the very truth of that affection which in its purest mani- festation is sure to consolidate a union of soul, a union of life. Strange that Edith Merton should not have lingered long with him she loved thus; but she broke from his enchantment, from his presence, to learn in- solitude how to bear excess of joy -how to admit for time, for death, for eternity, another self, to think her thoughts and live her life. When alone in her chamber, after this intoxicating hour was past, she exclaimed, - "How soon these three weeks will be gone I and then I shall bear another name, and be no longer mine own self. Then reverie will be useless, a trespass upon his claim, and self-examination be hardly a plea for solitude; for will he not share my duties as well as joys, and mingle his higher experience to aid me to reach his ideal? His ideal I What can that be? I have found mine, but his - O, mother, part with some smile of your bliss, stamp me with beauty and good- ness, that I, living nearer to thee, may here upon earth develop into something akin to thy nature.:'   "FE 'AND ALONE.      349 CHAPTER XX,. "ETTERS from both Lady Glenville and Edith had been sent to Mr. Merton. An answer came, and the latter was summoned home, where her father's answer to her wishes should be given in person. To Lady Blanche he wrote that he would place no obstacle to their union if a longer acquaintance than the three weeks she mentioned made them still desire it. As for himself, he should prefer to spend some little time with his daughter before giving her up, as it were, almost unknown. Certainly there could be no objec- tion raised to these letters, and immediately Roth- schild set out withl Edith for Middleton, while Ida promised to follow in a few weeks. They tarried a moment at Melville Castle; and with all its sad asso- ciations it was hard for Edith to say good by. Not all the kind attentions of*Rothschild could banish the drear feeling which from the hour she parted with Lord and Lady Melville crept over her heart. Then for the first time came the thought of meeting her f              t  &#xD;<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7083-00000175"/> 350       LIFE AND ALONE. father. What would he be like, and how would she appear to Him? : But Rothschild's voice roused her from this reverie, and she remembered how soon she should exchange her strange lot of loneliness at the call of the voice of her childhood, and, even if a fa- ther's love was denied her, know of one truer and deeper. On they sped to their journey's end. As the sands of all our golden hours run fast away, so Time lingered not for them, and bore the inter- change of -beautiful thoughts and hopes adown his rapid stream. Rothschild would rather talk of the future; Edith of the present, because- was not her future realized? He could not blame her heart, so satisfied with its joy, so filled with passionate love for him, and he listened to its faint expression, and well appreciated this beauty of her life. What to her was the mystery or obscurity attending his birth? It was the only subject he had with trembling approached; but she bade him dismiss all imaginary care, for that, like other mortals, they must find amid their golden tissue of happiness many a dark thread woven, and all their strength was needed to meet the real. As night fast came on, and they were within one hour's ride from Middleton, Edith exclaimed, "How strange it happens I I always enter upon new scenes at night time, and now I am to reach my father's house at night."   "FE AND ALONE.       351 "Thank you, dearest, for not saying your home. That event shall be timed differently ; but do not look so sad. You do not look as happy as I feel." "We must be sad, sometimes, Herbert, or our happy moments would be too heavy to be borne." "Not so, my beloved; that idea comes from the solitude of your early years. I must do it away, and see you always cheerful." So full of tender anxiety was the look he now kept bent upon her, she restrained her dark forebodings within herself, and talked cheerfully, with bright smiles, until the carriage stopped at her father's door. She walked towards the well-remembered parlor, stopped a moment near the door while Rothschild bent forward and whispered "Edith,"' and his glad smile reassured her to enter. Her father, just as she remembered him, seemingly not a day older, was standing with his back towards the fire and command- ing a full view of their entrance. He gazed upon them both in cold scrutiny, then extended his hand to Edith. At the same time he bowed low to Rothschild, and said, - "You have returned, young man.   The Abbe D'Estrand seems to have well kept his word, with one exception." "I know nothing of the terms of my absence," an-  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7083-00000176"/> 352      'LIFE AND 'ALONE. swered Rothschild. "I have felt too anxious to re- pay a debt and discharge a duty imposed upon me in my boyhood to defer longer a return to this place." "You speak in metaphor, sir." "Perhaps, Mr. Merton, I may be able to prove to you that, however unwelcome, my presence here is unavoidable." "I shall require proofs, sir, after which you may be better assured of my hospitality." Then turning to his daughter, whose hand he still held, he remarked in a pleasanter tone, "I You are probably tired from your journey. To-morrow will be soon enough to renew our acquaintance." Edith looked at Rothschild, and smiled her good- night. The reception he had met from her father explained the undefined dread which had lain on her heart. The two men thus left alone, a long si- lence ensued, until Mr. ]Merton most impatiently ex- claimed, - "I know no better time than at once to learn why I am favored with this call. To have even heard of you in this part of the country is a falsehood on the part of the Abbe D'Estrand; but this -forced inter- view under my own roof demands explanation." "Is am ignorant to what you allude, sir; but my return here with your daughter must suggest the   "FE AND ALONE.       353 business upon which I come. In plainer words, I would obtain her father's sanction to crown hopes sanctioned in boyhood by her mother." An oath almost burst from  the lips of Mr. Merton; but he restrained himself, and answered, calmly, - "I understand you ask my consent to wed my daughter." "You are right, sir," said Rothschild. "And what will be your course without that con- sent?" "I shall not yield our united hopes of happiness to the whim of one who, after neglecting his child for years, merely retains the name of parent." "Plainly and deferentially spoken, and it has de- cided me to grant the consent, asked for form's sake. I give my'full' consent to your marriage with my daughter, on one condition-that before the event d shall take place you give me the record of your birth, &amp;c. On investigation, however obscure that birth is, or who or what may have been your parents, I prom- ise to grant your request." The cold, sneering tone with which these words were uttered prevented any gratitude being expressed, and with quite as contemptuous a manner Rothschild replied, - 23  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7083-00000177"/> )LZ]4:     LIFE AND ALONE. "Should future attempts be as fruitless to ascertain my parentage as former ones have been, yet will I not resign my claim to your daughter's hand, prom- ised me by herself; and no human power shall sepa- rate us." "It is needless for me to repeat my words, sir; I will only add that I forbid another interview between Miss Merton and yourself until .every mystery be cleared away to my satisfaction." "Surely, Mr.. Merton, you will not deny my seeing and taking leave of Edith. Such mean cruelty is in- compatible with the name of gentleman." "Spare me the details of a lover's agony, and I must also seem inhospitable till I have the honor of knowing who is my guest; our interview is ended, sir.' Rothschild felt distressed to depart without seeing Edith, and to leave her in such hands; but there was no alternative, and, once-more in his carriage, he gave the order to be driven to his early home. If any hope actuated him to direct' his course thither, it was de- stroyed at a glance; everything around bore marks of long desertion. Back to the village he went to prosecute inquiries concerning the friend of his youth, but all to no avail. But one course remained to him - to hasten back to Italy, and demand from the Abbe   "FE AND ALONE.       355 D'Estrand all that he knew concerning his birth. He made a short stay at Glenville Castle to secure the kind interference of Lady Blanche for Edith, and to forward her knowledge of his movements through Ida. Lord Melville having shown so much interest in Edith, he thought some suggestions from his lord- ship might be of service, and took in his way Mel- ville Castle. Disappointment seemed to attend his steps. Lord and Lady Melville were8'absent, and Ir- ving, noticing the dejected and changed appearance of the elegant Rothschild, felt his sympathies aroused, and for Edith's sake pressed every kind attention. He urged him to await Lord Melville's return; but Rothschild thought the more speed to the abbe, the sooner the realization of his hopes. But at last Ir- ving prevailed upon him to wait until the morning. He must spend the night somewhere, and no trains would serve his purpose until the following day. The greater part of the night was spent in conversation by the young men, and after Rothschild had confided the little he knew of himself, he remarked, -- "You, Melville, with your ambition and superiority to us lower mortals, must deem me weak enough to be thus overcome by an obstacle in a love affair; and were it not that you are no stranger to Edith, I should be surprised at your kind sympathy.'7  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7083-00000178"/> 356       LIFE AND ALONE. "Love must be, then, the very strength of weak- ness," answered Irving, "for it cometh alike upon all. It is the network of character, upon which all other purposes in life are woven." "True, Melville; but I have often seen, in com- pany, your lip curl and your whole manner- express contempt for the passion." "Only its counterfeit, which particularly came under my observation at Lady Glenville's. I except Edith; yet her heart story seems to be rather a ro- mance, beautiful and rare, of worth because it hasl moulded a character superior to the generality of her sex.' "Then why, Melville, owning the omnipotence of love, do you eschew it for yourself?" "Because I believe in its unity; -and what could kindle the feeling anew amid the ashes of a heart love has consumed? No, Rothschild; you will retract your opinion of me when I tell you this little casket I wear contains more of the -wealth of love than beats in any living heart." As he spoke he took from his neck the golden case containing Clara's writing. "Where did you get that?" exclaimed Rothschild. ' From my boyhood I have worn one, its counterpart. It may have a secret spring like yours."   "FE AND ALONE.       351 It had one, and there lay folded within a bit of paper, on which were written these words : "The abbe can solve the mystery of your birth," and signed ", A. D." "This is a singular Coincidence," said Irving; , the locket looks like Genoa workmanship, and if I had not seen so many like these, I might be led to imagine that in some way we were linked together. Clara had one given her by her mother,- the spring and all exactly the same." "But there is no mystery attending your parent- age?" asked Rothschild. "No; not much.   I was born of respectable enough, but very humble, contadina in Italy, taken a fancy to by Lady Melville, brought here when two years old, and legally adopted, I suppose; but now your course seems marked out for you. Ida and my- self will guard your interest in Edith, and tidings from her you shall constantly receive through us." At an early hour in the morning the two young men parted, and Rothschild started on his journey, with his spirit chee6red with a thousand hopes. Once more in her own chamber, Edith felt almost a child again. As she went to her room, a  group of servants were collected in the hall to stare at their new mistress, amid whom was Janet, and she was made most happy by the glad recognition Edith gave  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7083-00000179"/> 358       LIFE AND ALONE. her. With what a feeling of peace and security did Edith lie down upon the bed where she had slept night after night in her earliest years I She smiled on per- ceiving the playthings, so seldom used in life's play- time, all arranged, as of old, on the closet shelves. "And this, after all, is home," she exclaimed, "with all its coldness, silence, and dreariness. It is filled with images of the past; 'tis alive with memo- ries and the green of, youth. It seems as if here I might be always young. Childhood can never die in the spot where it was born until the grave claims it. Rothschild here is again the beggar boy; but, after all, the word home comprehends a new sensation of happiness. It hath some semblance to the freed spirit's entrance into heaven-all the glory and splendor there producing no strange feeling; only one's spirit experiencing the idea of security, of rest, like mine here; no aching sense of happiness, no de- lirium of joy, but a familiar recognition of something called home." Sleep continued the peaceful train of such thought for Edith Merton, and the morning was far advanced when she descended to the breakfast-room. Janet was there with the intelligence that her father had left home for a day or two, and Rothschild too was gone. Stranger still, he had left no message for her;   "FE AND ALONE.'       359 but she comforted herself with the hope of a letter, and, after she had partaken of her solitary meal, visited the haunts of her childhood. The second morning a note from Ida relieved suspense concerning Roth- schild, and her father's decision as to their marriage was to Edith only a pleasant proof that he did have some interest in the fate of his child. She was will- ing now to take a breathing time for happiness, and await in perfect trust the future. No two persons, whom God intended one, could be parted by the power of man, was her simple faith. Her intense love for-home  grew stronger every day, though she smiled at the old habit kept up now-to take her seat upon the floar beside the open closet door, and indulge in reverie long and sweet. After her father's return, meal-time only brought the two together; and where he had expected ques- tionings upon his interview with her lover, a perfect silence was maintained. He had imagined to find a love-sick damsel wearing a continued look of woe, and could scarcely forbear to respect the proud -girl who seemed to have power 'enough within herself to bear any fate without murmuring.  He could not think she wanted feeling, for even the slight- opportu- nity he had for seeing Rothschild had impressed him in his favor. One more elegant of person and manner  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7083-00000180"/> 360       LIFE AND ALONE. he had never met with, and he could trust the Abbe D'Estrand for the mind's training. As days went on, he half wondered at the strength of a young girl, thus alone, yet so happily, outwardly, awaiting the issue of events. While Mr. Merton was exercising his natural taste for fathoming human nature, his daughter read him through and through, and most skilfully warded off any similar power being exercised upon herself. As strangers they had met, and were likely to continue such. No inadvertent chance word betrayed her thoughts, or lurking smile discovered to him that she read his little meannesses of character, or the motives which prompted his every effort at conversation. Edith had refused Ida's kind proposal- to come to Middleton until her thoughts should be less engrossed with self, and she could do more to make her happy, and through Ida she heard constantly of Rothschild's movements. Her cousin's fine hand- writing escaped observation, while a letter from Ir- ving, purposely sent to divine its fate, never reached her hands. Several weeks after Rothschild's depart- 'ure, Mr. Merton, perhaps satisfied that no skill of his would give him a clearer insight into the new phase of human nature brought before him, summoned his daughter, and went with her to the door of the apart- ment which had been her mother's private sitting-   "FE AND ALONE.       361 room. Since her decease the room had ever been kept locked, as, indeed, it was before; and the last time Edith had been in it was the evening before her departure for school. By a powerful effort she re- strained every show of emotion, and awaited what was to follow. Her father's voice was lower than usual, and she fancied there was some feeling in the tone with which he said, - "This room is now yours, if you choose to occupy it, and here is the key to your mother's private desk; her papers, if she left any, are untouched there. I have never entered the room since her death, and I had no need to search for proofs of what I knew too well. Should there be no record of her past historyk found here, I shall be ready, for the sake of your fu- ture welfare, to discharge my duty; and any time you can give me the result of your search." He turned the key in the lock, and left her at the door. There Edith stood motionless, until, the other key falling from her hand, its sound reminded her that now she might enter within the retreat of one whose life had been fraught to her with painful inter- est and mystery. She entered the room. Every- thing looked familiar there, and had been kept in the nicest order, probably by the faithful Janet. The number of books in their proper place convinced her  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7083-00000181"/> 362       LIFE AND ALONE. at a glance here was a store of rich reading for the future. Her eye fell on a large old-fashioned desk, to which, with a feeling akin to awe, she applied the key, and found it filled with papers and letters arranged with care, and a date upon the several packages. There was a smaller bundle of letters addressed to the Abbe D'Estrand, and one or two larger which bore the name of Edward Dalton on the outside. At the onset Edith hesitated, and asked herself, Is it right thus to intrude upon the secrets of the dead? She knew nothing of her mother's last illness. A sudden death might have prevented her destroying these papers, which perhaps she had in- tended. Was it only an idle curiosity which prompted her desire to read them? She tried to solve her doubts by thinking: those addressed to the Abbe D'Estrand might throw some light upon her lover's parentage; it was her duty to read those; and, after opening one, she might as well know the contents of all. Still unsatisfied with her reasoning, she closed the desk, locked the room, and left it. Her father supposed, from her manner at dinner, nothing particu- lar had been found, at least nothing to agitate her. He seemed surprised, and remarked that he would defer his explanation for a few days. He was obliged to leave home in that evening's train, and on his re-   "FE AND ALONE.        363 turn there would be time enough to harrow up the past for both of them. Edith could not understand to what he referred, or his peculiar manner during the meal, and they separated mutually in, the dark. The remaining hours of the day dragged heavily. There was a strong desire to return to her mother's room; then the exercise of a petty tyranny, or penance, upon so natural a wish. She blamed herself for her impatience to penetrate the secrets of the dead, and finally relinquished her purpose until another day. At night her reverie was unsatisfactory ; seif-examina- tion brought home the fact that she had lost a day; and, dissatisfied with herself, she concluded it would be better to know the contents of every letter in the desk without delay, than to waste any more days in surmising and restless doubts. The Abbe D'Estrand had chosen, about this time, to make a retreat to his cloister in order to do penance for past sin, or fortify himself for any he might be pleased to commit in the future. Neither by letter or in any other way could mortal gain access to him, until such time as he should emerge from the cloister, sanctified, it is to be hoped, and prepared to tell the truth at any cost. In the mean time, Edith could feed on her love letters; but they bore somewhat the coloring of the writer's disappointment at finding the  &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7083-00000182"/> 364       LIFE AND ALONE. abbe had left Florence only two days before his arri- val, and it was worse than useless to apply to any other source for information. Edith's letters, on the contrary, might serve for balm to a chafed spirit, did not every one set forth her character in brighter and more charming light, increasing Rothschild's desire to know her for his own beyond the power of human agency to affect that union.   "FE AND ALONE.       365, CHAPTER    XXI. EDITH began a new day by locking herself up in her mother's room. She little dreamed that in a few short hours any desire for a union with Herbert Rothschild would be the next horrible thought she should enter- tain. We will not wade through the pile of letters she did, but give the contents of one or two addressed to Edward Dalton, dated Naples. MY HUSBAND: To what end this tyranny exercised over me by Lord Glenville will lead I know not. He employs his wife and menials as spies upon my con- duct, and to-day, through their espionage, all my efforts have failed. The strong hope that to-morrow, once more with you, I could bid defiance to any new attempt at separating us, is driven to the winds. The future now looks all gloom.' My boys I how my heart yearns to behold them again I I know of Annie's love and de- votion to them, and try to remember how much worse  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7083-00000183"/> 366      LIFE AND ALONE. their conditior might be; but the one wild thought rack- ing my brain is, Unto what does all this persecution tend? I have overheard talk of a departure for England, and cannot hope to be left behind. I tremble while I write, from fear of detection. I laugh to scorn the at- tempts to prove our marriage null and void. Do you think they can succeed? I am more and more con- vinced that the existence of our beloved children must be hidden from these brutal relatives, or their Yen- geance will take a wider sweep. You are mistaken; the knowledge of my boys would not soften such hearts. But why should I add thus to your grief? Know that I do not quite despair, dear Edward.- Some faint hope whispers I shall yet rejoin you before this leaving for England. O, Dalton I though our love needs not the experience of misfortune to teach the one or the other how dear we are to each other, yet we shall know a 'depth of joy in reunion and home scarce dreamed of before. My beautiful boys I If deprived of one of their rightful guardians, they are enjoying their fa- ther's love, and I know Annie's care of them is tender as my own. Every hour I am attempting some plan of escape. That, with thought of thee, my husband, and of my children, so fills my heart, that I am more than half insensible to the insults heaped upon my head.      Yours,     EDITH DALTON.   "FE AND ALONE.       367 BELOVED DALTON : When this reaches you our separa- tion will be widening, the distance between us increas- ing, every moment. I must add another pang to your sufferings, and tell you that my worst fears are being realized. If it should be decided, as Lord Glenville affirms, that our marriage is illegal, what next? He scorns at my declaring I have been a Catholic for years; but everything I can bear, if God would grant me a sight of you and those children. Their existence is as yet unsuspected by my persecutors. Will it be safe to gratify my yearning desire that you should all follow me to England? Though my heart breaks while I write it, don't for a moment expose the safety of my boys, or do anything which shall give these people knowledge of their existence. I feel, more than I can write, the importance of this. Let me tell you again that both you and Annie are mistaken; that nothing could incline their hearts to pity me. Lord Glenville's vengeance would spurn all obstacles, even did he know I had two living boys. And yet, Dal- ton, I can both pity and forgive his wife if any linger- ing love for you goads her on to this revenge. With all the agony I have endured, there would be a worse one still if you could forget or cease to love me. In all my wretchedness the certainty of your love keeps hope alive, and shines into my heart, the brightness  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7083-00000184"/> O0u       L IFia AN D ALON i. of a noonday future. How often do I imagine you gazing upon the children, reading in their faces the mother's look, and listening with so much joy to the name they so constantly utter! And Annie, too- do my twins love her as they would their mother? Does she find some repayment for her unparalleled devotion in their young hearts' gratitude? What can reward her on arth? Surely it must be an angel's privilege to devise happiness for one like her. Dal- ton, our next meeting will be far from your much loved land. Never fear but that the thought of our reunion will mitigate my every woe. My heart goes back to you with all its power to love, to Annie, to my boys. I feel that our separation may soon have its ending in joy.   Yours, EDITH DALTON. DALTON : Condemn forever, as a living, breathing, acting falsehood, the wife you have loved, the mother of your children, the friend of your sister, -the woman who now no longer bears your name. It is with the hope, that, insulted and outraged, you may be able to despise me with all the strength of your nature, that I dare pen to you the record of my-guilt. I write not the details to extenuate the crime, but to lengthen with words the moments, ere I bid you an eternal   "FE AND ALONE.       369 farewell. M]ay no part of Annie's nature be yours. She forgives, and loves me still; but let not your hatred admit a shade of pity. Were your continued love possible, it would be the heaviest punishment Heaven could lay upon me to bear. I would pray to be spared that. - After leaving Italy, my sorrows and trials were all forgotten by the scene which awaited me on my arrival in England. I have no language for it; that alone would have parted us forever. Lord Glenville had heard of Annie's arrival with Herbert. Of Irving's existence he is still ignorant; but why do I delay? He placed before me the awful alterna- tive --a disgraced living death, or a marriage with his agent and constant intercourse with Annie and my child. No matter what induced me to make choice -it cannot palliate my guilt. I did not fall into the snare, but -made choice, and am now the falsehood of another man's home--by him a valued truth; while hour by hour the spectre of my real being haunts me, and the fear of detection constitutes my life. This is the prelude of my farewell to you, my very spirit's moan ere I write the word farewell. Our children! Their innocence and helplessness must plead for their mother to be forgotten. Forgiveness must be a higher prerogative than can belong to hu- man nature for sin such as mine. If I dare not seek 24.  &#xD;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7083-00000185"/> 3'0     v LIFE AND ALONE. it of Heaven, - and it is true I dare not,---I breathe not the wish for yours. My soul is black as night folded in a storm, which shall last for time and for eternity. I summon a deeper, denser blackness than before, and bid farewell to you. Nothing of the past, save in a soul's throe of agony for pardon from God, must be thought of by      EDITH 5MERTON. To the Abb6 D'Estrand. DALTON : The mother's sin hath found her out. Mer- ton knows all. I thought it had been your act to crown my suffering with new woe, when you denied me Irving. I now see your judgment was best in giving him up to Lord Melville, and my heart is at rest re- specting his fate. Herbert was mine. Now, all for which I sold myself must go; and my heart can say, it hath no more room for grief. Herbert will be the bearer of this letter to you--his father. Dalton, I am on the brink of the grave, and may now cast one look back on the husband of my youth. I send to you, as it were from that dark abode I am so soon to enter, a voice in the behalf of your child. I know of Irving's welfare. I plead for Herbert. TWe have seen revenge sweep terror, sin, and destruction across our pathway. O, visit not the sin of the mother upon our child! Surely in death, Dalton, you may forgive.   "FE AND ALONE.       3'1 There is nothing left me now but a few remnant hours to seek mercy from Heaven. All, all alone I must live them out. God grant his presence when a darker vale still I tread. One more pang is mine, for Annie leaves me. I have pleaded her stay in vain; her de- votion was for your child; for his sake I was toler- ated. Life and alone! but short the hour before I shall be summoned to the judgment bar of Christ. Dalton, when you meet my boy, lay aside the mem- ory of the loathed Edith Merton, anl recall, for a moment, the mother of your children, when together we smiled our joy as infant voices -sweetly lisped, "Father" and "Mother."  That hour enjoins upon you a sacred duty - Herbert's welfare and education. As you hope for heaven, fail not in these. Through this dark night there shines, though dimly-there shines a ray of light. My guilt and shame are to end soon. There is a never-failing mercy which I trust in, that no record of it is made in eternity. And when over humbled pride and penitence the clod of the val- ley has fallen, then sometimes think kindly of her who was               EDITH DALTON. Many were the letters Edith read, ere her mind was able to comprehend her relationship to Herbert an4  &#xD;<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7083-00000186"/> 3 2       LIFE AND ALONE. Irving. She trembled at her own wretchedness when fully understood. "Brother and sister," again and again she repeated. Then went out of her heart all the garnered thoughts of years. She felt the past sink into oblivion, and exclaimed, "Life and alone." She had uttered and felt those words before; she lived them now. At present she seemed to herself once more the sad child who had so often entered that room and found neither affection nor sympathy. Vain was her search for one line left by the dead, making mention of her. The thought, which had lain for years a wakeful fear in her breast, aroused and forced home the truth: she had never been loved at home. What was she but a constant reminder of her mother's falsehood? But a life of dreary woe too well atoned for guilt in Edith's mind for her to harbor any unkind feeling towards the dead. She replaced every letter, locked and left the apartment. She then spent hours in writing. No reverie was indulged in. The old, deep look of childhood once more stamped her countenance, It seemed as if years, in little time, had left their impress on her face. Youth was gone forever; to keep up its semblance she laid her down to sleep with lips parted in a smile, and awoke in the morning with the deception playing around her mouth.   "FE AND ALONE.       373 She began the day with hard study, portioned tasks for every hour, and when her father returned, met him as usual. She put into his hand a letter, request- ing him to read and forward it to Herbert Rothschild. Mr. Merton did so, and once again his knowledge of human nature was at fault to- know with what degree of feeling the following letter had been written :- MY BELOVED BROTHER: It has been, by an over- ruling Providence, reserved for me to make known to you the truth you are in search of. My mother, whose kindness and love you so well remember as shown to you in boyhood, was likewise your own parent; Ed- ward Dalton, known now as the Abbd D'Estrand, your father; and from him you can learn the details of facts I make known to you. The secret of your birth revealed is that of another's also. Irving Mel- ville and you are brothers. Questions might arise which I hope will never be the subject of even feeling between us. Must these truths be made public? Let our own hearts alone recognize the relationship. The Abbe D'Estrand can have no motive as regards prop- erty -which will be honorably adjusted - to make public what so long has been buried in his and my father's breasts. Let us thank God that the knowl- edge is our own. Let Lord Melville, when it shall be  &#xD;<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7083-00000187"/> 8o:4    -  LIFE AND ALONE. his pleasure, communicate what we know to Irving. I can love my brothers, whether recognized by the world as such or not. You will at once see the neces- sity of awaiting the Abbe D'Estrand's return home, and now feel the claim he has upon you. To know of your and Irving's welfare will ever make glad the heart of your sister,      EDITH MERTON. A cool letter, thought Mr. Merton. The gentleman forgot it had been handed him to read, and was suffi- cient for that purpose. It reached Rothschild, and somewhat prepared his mind for a meeting with his father. The abbe experienced only relief in pouring out his whole heart to his son; but Rothschild pressed him close as to the validity of his marriage, and with tnixed feelings received all the proofs which dispersed doubts. He learned that it was only a few days after his own departure for Italy in the days of his boy- hood, that the kind aunt with whom he had lived knew the full extent of the wrong done her brother. She had been informed--and deceived thereby-- that he was the guilty party, that his marriage with Edith Esterhazy was not legal; and compassion for her early friend, thus deceived and betrayed, had in- ! duced her to take up her abode with Herbert at the cottage. When she knew the whole truth,- contempt   "FE AND ALONE.        375 was her only feeling, and she at once quitted Mrs. Merton's neighborhood. No matter what had sepa- rated Edith from her brother, by her own act was she eternally condemned in Annie Dalton's mind, and they parted forever. Her second marriage was viewed but as the climax of her guilt, and not, as had been rep- resented to her sister-in-law, the only alternative of a fearful choice. Edward Dalton was involved in some political intrigues, Lord Glenville's voice all potent to cover or condemn, and some other such specious rea- sons given when required.  Well might the mother enjoin it upon her child to shun intimacies at school, for all her own sorrows she traced to the day when Annie Dalton and herself formed a friendship for each other. It was impossible for Edith not to learn, from her mother's diary, that at the time of her first marriage she was in the communion of the Catholic church, and her heart acknowledged another pang when she could only view herself as the child of guilt and shame. Contrary to her wishes, Irving Melville was informed of the late discovery, but a letter from him in the true' spirit of brotherly kindness made her less regret it. From Rothschild personally she did not hear; he could not write as Irvingj and it were better to forget. Be- fore the House of Lords, Irving Melville, as he still  &#xD;<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7083-00000188"/> 376       LIFE AND ALONE. called himself, had finished one of the most brilliant speeches ever heard within those walls. Lord Mel- ville sat in proud, contented silence, and had just bowed his head to conceal too much of satisfaction, darting almost flame from his eye upon his opponents, as he heard the stifled sound around him. Hush I he speaks again; he is not through yet. Lord Melville lifted his face, and saw rise again the noble form of that much loved son. He thought to himself, there is no stay to the flow of his genius, he will carry everything before him, -when, lo! a perfect torrent of blood gushed from Irving's mouth, and he sank back on his seat exhausted. In less than a moment's time he was borne, in his adopted father's arms, to their carriage, and a physician was by his side. "Even I," said an aged peer to his companion, "expected to hear more than to-day from that young man; but I verily believe he will quit the stage be- fore I shall." "We have heard his last speech," was the answer; and in thoughtful silence both went on their way. "I have marked that young genius well," said one of the opposition; "he will never take his place against us again; and the young prop fallen, Lord Melville is nothing, and the whole party is swept into the shade."'   "FE AND ALONE.       317 "According to the fiat of physicians, I must send you from me, my dear boy," exclaimed Lord Melville, entering Irving's room, where he was striving to ap- pear only half invalid, and had engaged Gerard at a game of chess. "You must pass the coming winter months in Italy. I shall meet you there, and bring you back-in the spring." "Yes; I shall go home in the spring," half mur- mured Irving; then, meeting the anxious looks of his friends, he asked, smiling, "tHow soon am I to go? ' "Gerard will start with you in a few days, and be your companion until you meet Rothschild; but I shall have you back as early as the season will al- low." From the fear of alarming Lord Melville, Irving would not urge how strong was his desire to die at home. Hie knew that all his friends thought he would recover, but entertained no such hope himself. But why should he undeceive them? Accordingly, at the appointed time, he, with Gerard, set off for a sunnier clime. Rothschild met them, and Gerard returned home bearing tidings how well the journey had been borne, and how much better the invalid seemed. Ani- mated with abundant hope, Lord Melville returned to his duties with new zeal, and in the mean time the sick man had reached Naples. Father and son have  &#xD;<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7083-00000189"/> 3'8       LIFE AND ALONE. met, and the three dwell together, with all the appur- tenances of their rank and wealth. Rothschild had planned how much he was to show Irving; but the abb6, gazing upon his son, could only think how like his face to the mother; and, though with many bitter memories stirred, he nursed him night and day, with almost a woman's tenderness. The milder air did not revive the invalid's strength, and in a very few days after his arrival he was confined to his bed; and scarce another week went by before a nurse was stationed there. She was an elderly woman, dressed in the ha- biliments of a nun; and Irving very much wondered she should be out of her convent, because her garb bore evidence of the strictest Order. One day, feel- ing wakeful and inclined to talk, he asked her how she had obtained permission to be there; if the Abb6 D'Estrand had aught to do with her convent. Her broken sobs alone made answer, and, still more in- terested, Irving plied his questions. At length she said,- "I am your aunt, Annie Dalton," and bowed her head in renewed weeping. Irving's brow grew black, but he controlled himself, and said, calmly, - "Then you are to watch over my death-bed; but remember I am not of your religion, and when the last moment comes I want no priest by my bedside." She   "FE AND ALONE.       839 made him no answer. "Promise me," he continued, more vehemently, " that none of your senseless rites shall disturb the solemnity of an hour I await with so much perfect peace and joy. I have seen Clara Mel- ville die, and know in whom she trusted. Promise me-"But as he spoke, the blood gushed violently from his mouth, and impeded further utterance. As if with the strength of a last effort, he faintly mur- mured, "Promise me,' closed his eyes, and sank away into that sleep from which there is no waking until the trumpet's call summons a world to rise. Here were the tears shed over the remains of the gifted Irving by the household where he died. His body was preserved with every care, and forward- ed to England to Melville Castle. At the hall door stood Lord Melville, gazing down the avenue; and he knew by the sound of the slow, heavy tramp, which fell upon his ear, what would soon meet his view. As the coffin was borne within the house, he spoke low to the men:- "Carefully, very carefully; you will wake my boy. He must not be awaked until spring-time, when he will pass the new bill and put down all opposition." Gerard gently drew his father from the scene; but at no time did he fully seem to realize the actual death of his adopted son: upon that subject his mind was  &#xD;<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC7083-00000190"/> 380      LIFE AND ALONE. jarred forever. Spring went and came again; but his constant remark concerning Irving was, - "My boy is better; he comes home in the spring." Very soon the prophecy made was true;" the joung prop gone," and Lord Melville in all political affairs was as if he lived not. "Come, Herbert; you have pondered long enough over that letter of Merton," said the Abbl D'Estrand to his son one day. "Its contents can Ibe summed up in one word: Justice. The property by right is yours, and no more need be said.' "It is more than an act of justice," said Roth- schild, " for I certainly never should have claimed it." "Pshaw!" returned the abbr. "Listen : I have something to urge upon you of more consequence. You have heard me say a thousand times that nothing but ambition should tempt a man to marry, and I have never changed that opinion. At the risk of seeming inconsistent, it is now my strong desire to see you married-connected with some suitable family. What fools call love, you, no more than your father before you, can be assured of in any woman. Not one could stand a test, fail to deceive, or resist a temptation, from Eve downward." "My father, though I may never pretend to the passion, yet my sentiments are very unlike yours on the subject."   "FE AND ALONE.       381 "I dare say.; but you must remember you went through a strange ordeal. It was the cry of nature which revealed to you this ideal of a pure love; the same drew Irving to Edith Merton, and her first sight of me was an undefined dislike. She cared for Irving long before she knew of relationship. Rest assured you can know nothing of the chimera men call love by the past." r "You are mistaken, sir; I have the same ideal of womanhood I found in Edith Merton.'" "Herbert, this is worse than madness. Women are nowhere angels, and love may well be called the frenzy of the mind. Blessed be Heaven, it is of short du- ration. We all make fools of ourselves, and come forth scarred and mortified." Why did the man's voice falter, and he rise hasti- ly to put an end to the conversation himself had in- troduced? Because Herbert for a moment had a loolk strangely like his mother. The abbe, when alone again, drew from his pocket a miniature, and gazed long and sadly thereupon. H-is fate was to feel an undying love, whatever he might affirm on the subject to his son. Rothschild began to act upon the advice given, and looked around among his many friends. There were two sisters of a proud, noble family, - which should he take? The elder was the more beau-  &#xD;<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7083-00000191"/> 382       LIFE AND ALONE. tiful; both were simpletons. And he decided the elder it should be, and to her poured forth his tale of pas- sion. If his voice faltered, it was the intonation of love! Much was not required to be said; for the young lady met his glance, and was won. He lis- tened to her singing, looked his delight, and fairly be- lieved he had never heard music before. It was over a song, hurried by the depth of his feeling, that he proposed in set phrase, and heard the faint reply, I' Ask papa." "O, how handsome he is 1 I said she to her sister; "and he has gone to ask papa. Don't let us be found listening. He might come back suddenly." "I mean to have just as much of his attention as ever," answered the younger. "1He is superb. I never saw a better waltzer. But what will you do with poor Walter?" "Do with him! Why, keep on loving him as well as ever. But papa swore I never should marry him." Alas for the elegant Rothschild 1 He will realize his ideal was a mockery yet. He married, and wrote Edith his first letter to announce the event. The abb6, satisfied with the connection, retired to his convent. He had fought well with society to heal his own heart- wounds; and now, both brother and sister spent their remaining days in acts of severe penance, and after   "FE AND ALONE.       383 death were canonized as saints. Herbert mourned sin- cerely the loss of his father, and when he remembered his brilliant talents, would sometimes think what his own youth had promised; but it was hard to break away from the easy; luxurious life he led. And what had Fame brought his father? Nothing I A year of penance had done more for him. What had it brought Irving I Death I Then his wife hated a book. She preferred him a splendid attache, and her soft flatteries, occasionally gliding into his ears, decided him to be content as he was--the butterfly of an hour. He never revisited England. The Countess de Montville half believed she had been mistaken in her opinion of his talents, and put the question to a friend in his presence, "Does a man always sink to the level of his wifd? - with her brilliant eyes fixed upon Roth- schild. The pointed shaft struck home, but, like many others, only lay in his mind to rust. Could he have re- called the abbe's early lessons of ambition, and worked out a truth for himself that when ambition has an aim out of itself - an aim to benefit a fellow-creature there is its worth, he might yet have been saved. No matter for the ideal of love.

Edith read the letter containing news of Herbert's marriage with delight. Her heart had been deeply saddened by the death of Irving and the sad condi- tion of Lord Melville; and any news of a joyful na- ture was a happy relief to her thoughts. She hdd given up reverie and music, improvising or singing, and her days were passed in hard study or tasks. She was too much occupied to ever put the question, "Am I happy?" and thus escaped an answering thought. The father and daughter were still strangers to each other. Nothing could break down the barrier of-cold reserve between them. This suggested the idea to Edith that she was an intruder in her own father's house. Do whast she might to banish it, the thought would come back again. Her mind would fain have grasped the early faith of childhood; but religion now seemed different to her-a something to be done as well as believed in.

With the poor and the afflicted she might give relief and pleasure ; but another class she would have sought called her proud. Could they have looked into her heart, how little of the kind of pride they accused her of would have been found! She was a being apart from them. Her soul was like a star, and dwelt in its own firmament; but no inward consciousness of su- periority kept her thus aloof. It was a want of tact or knowledge how she might gain the crowd; though a few her fascination might attract for a moment. The one want of woman's nature is love. If she has the real, she is content; if only the ideal, then is her soul sick, like a bird far out of its native clime, pant- ing for a sunnier sky, and at length folding its weary wing, failing to reach, with silent note, resteth still, to die. 25 }              .     ,         v  &#xD;<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7083-00000193"/> 386       LIFE AND ALONE. CHAPTER    XXII. "I AM come r said Ida Melville, bounding joyously into her cousin's room; " and on one condition only has mamma permitted the visit. It is, that you will return with me, and stay all winter. Besides my wanting to see you, I was most anxious to find out how you did exist here. I know what you mean to say--the old adage; but it is awful homely here." "I am glad to see you, Ida. I have often wished for a companion; but the very dulness of the place prevented my urging yoju to come." After the first joy of meeting was over, sad memo- ries began to intrude, and the two sat down together to converse in more sober mood. "Mamma has told me all," said Ida--" that Her- bert and Irving were your brothers, my own cousins. How much stranger is truth than fiction I When I heard of it, I ceased to care as much for-Irving; and I suppose you felt like me about Herbert. I mean, I did not love Irving as before, nor you Rothschild."   f LIFE AND ALONE.      388 "No; not as before," said Edith, it a low voice. "Mamma said," continued Ida, "that Irving's pop- ularity would have gone down with a change of min-' isters, and that would have affected Lord Melville almost as much as his death. She was perfectly shocked when she learned her relationship to Irving and Herbert, and don't like their names to be spoken before her." "Then how call she want me with her, Ida, who must remind her of both continually?" J "I don't know; but she does. Perhaps she-thinks you have suffered enough. You must not refuse her invitation, Edith. I want mamma should love you as well as I do, and she will if you will only show a little more affection in your manner towards lher. Now promise me, at once, that you will go home with me; if not, I take the afternoon train." "Not so fast, Ida. I shall be glad to go back with you; but I do not believe I could ever make your mother love me. Affection is for the young in feeling and the happy." "There, stop, Edith; no more of that. YWe will make you happy at Glenville Castle. Come show me this pygmy village. Do the people stare?" "They might be pardoned if they did at you," said Edith, gazing admiringly on the beautiful face  &#xD;<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7083-00000194"/> 388       LIFE AND ALONE. before her; "but we are not so rustic as you imagine." Only one week went by before Lady Glenville sum- moned her daughter to return home in company with Edith, and cordial indeed was the welcome she gave her niece. Ida was glad to see it. She did not know of the remorse preying upon her mother's mind, which found some respite in showing kindness to her sister's child. The castle was the scene of gay parties, and amusement the order of the day. It was at an even- ing entertainment that Mr. Beresford first saw Edith Merton. Ida he knew well, and she had been sing- ing at his request; and as he was strenuously urging another of his favorite songs from her, she replied,- "There, Mr. Beresford, if you could only hear my cousin sing, the music of every other person, to the end of your days, would sound like a child's practice." "Present me at once, and I will try my power to persuade her." Ida laughed, and asked, - "Do you wish to know her answer beforehand? Your courage might be daunted.' "No, no; perform your part by the mention of our names, and leave the rest to me." Ida took the proffered arm, drew near her cousin, and said, - "Edith, to your powers of song I have already intro-   "FE AND ALONE.       389 duced Mr. Beresford, and he is anxious to cultivate your acquaintance on selfish motives entirely." "Such frankness," answered Edith, smiling at Ida's manner, " must, of course, render me eager for his." "On any terms, Miss Merton ; although I had the pleasure of the whole crowd at heart when I begged an introduction to warrant my asking a song from you." An internal pang of anguish left its trace upon her face, in strange contrast with her smile, as she an- swered, - "I improvise all song, and you know one must wait to be in the mood for that." "Have you no power to summon the mood at will?" "No, indeed; I always wait very patiently for it to come." Mr. Beresford lingered by her side, or as near as pos- sible, during the remainder of his stay. He was quite charmed with her quiet dignity and lady-like manner. He read her thus . An amiable young woman, rather plain-looking, of just sufficient accomplishment not to bore one with display, and ready to yield her opinions to others without argument. "Beresford," exclaimed a young sprig of nobility, "you seemed taken with the statue last evening, somewhat."  &#xD;<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7083-00000195"/> 3Y1      LIFE AND ALONE. "With one of Wordsworth's women, you mean." "Well, I should think the old proser might have- carved her. Give me that splendid Ida, all fire and sparkle." "Pine crackles and goes out," answered Beresford. "I should prefer the more solid at my hearth-stone." "You are welcome to the niece and stupidity, if I could only win the daughter of Lady Glenville." Beresford was a bachelor, just at this time calling himself thirty, but ten years added would be his true age. He was the owner of a handsome fortune, but had feared to take to himself a partner earlier in life lest it should be lessened. Now, as sometimes the words " life and alone " jarred on his heart-strings, he had resolved to marry, and Edith Merton had indeed taken his fancy. She appeared to him not to require those little lover-like attentions, which would have made him feel foolish in attempting to offer, and he thought that she had none of that sickly sentiment and romance so prevalent among his lady friends ; that hers was a quiet, gentle temperament, and one pleas- ant to travel into the vale of years with. His opin- ion did not change on a farther acquaintance, nor was it ever shaken but once. He saw Edith in conversa- tion with a distinguished looking person, an aged man, whose position was very high in public life.   "FE AND ALONE.-      3,91 The peer had never been seen chained at the side of any woman, young or old, longer than the courtesies of life might demand; and he-and Edith were c ri- ously watched, as they stood talking together. Their theme must have 'been of intense interest to both. A brightness, as of old time kindled, stole back into- Edith Merton's eye, a faint flush, as she spoke burn- ing words of genius, banished her haggard look, and her voice was sweetly rich, as if ready for song. The old man turned away after a whole evening's talk with her, and remarked to a friend, - "That is a glorious girl; she makes me wish that my head wasnot whitened by seventy summers." Beresford liked no such lkindling eye irradiating talent, and was only satisfied that he had made a wise choice when Edith turned upon him the deep, dull look of childhood, the pale face whose smile was ghastly. One morning Lady Blanche, Edith, and Ida were sitting together employed on some fancy work, when Ida burst out with, - "Edith, I do verily believe ancient Berry is making up his mind to lay his pounds at your feet." "Ida," exclaimed Lady Blanche, in no very gentle tone, " such jesting is ill-timed and always unlady- like. I have the highest opinion of Mr. Beresford, and either of you would be fortunate to'win him.."  &#xD;<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7083-00000196"/> 392       LIFE AND ALONE. ' Win what, mamma? Daily food? We are nei- ther of us in want of that; but I wager my largest diamond ring he'll ask Edith to marry him the first. chance he gets." "Ida, you are incorrigible; I am ashamed of you. I should rejoice to see you or Edith the wife of so excellent a man." "I have heard he was mean, mamma." "fHe has a just appreciation of wealth, I dare say." "S Well said, mamma. I am glad my property is all settled upon myself, for fear you should be at- tacked with the disease of your venerable friend. I told Erskine, who, you kIow, is Mr. Beresford's ward, when he made me an offer, that we were too poor to marry; and-his answer was; that it was no matter, then, about mentioning the subject to you, as his guardian had only advised him to patch up his dissi- pated fortune by marrying one." Edith could not restrain her laughter at the giddy girl; but Lady Glenville, more exasperated, replied,- "I cannot see anything laughable in the repetition of a falsehood, or propriety in a young lady's making a jest of an offer." "I think I was made a jest of, mamma; only my property did not go the way Mr. Beresford suggested, *   "FE AND ALONE.       393 and still ministers to my own caprice." Lady Blanche quitted the roorm, and Ida continued, "There, Edith, give me credit for some skill. You now have proof that mamma wishes that you should marry old Beres- ford. I' was sure of it before; but you, my dear girl, cannot be thinking of such a thing." "It is no fault of yours," said Edith, laughing, "if I have not thought of it; it is the only subject you have conversed upon the last week." "True, Edith; for I wanted to make you hate him as I do." "Not hate, Ida; he is probably as indifferent to you as to me." "Edith, I would rather see you married to Lord Etherington. Old as he is, there is something fasci- nating about him. He looked at you last night quite like a lover, when you told him that the fruits of his ambition were worthy to gild life--or some such non- sense.  He is splendid. But what was his reply? It was most sunset to ambition, and he would lend himself to no transient glare at such an hour -I wish I could remember all. How strange the man never married I All the world has been in love with him. Would you marry him, Edith?  If so, I'll tell him of a still more glorious future than he would dare dream of. I can do it saucy-like, you know."  &#xD;<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7083-00000197"/> 394      LIFE AND ALONE. ' Hush, Ida; your mother says true ; you do talk at random." "Well, answer me just one question, and I'll weigh every other word I speak. Do you ever intend to marry?" A low, prolonged "Yes " was given. Ida, in half childish, half real dread, drew nearer her cousin, and asked,- "For what, dear Edith? You have told me that love could have no power over you." Edith bent forward, and, parted the rich curls from the young girl's brow, and said,- "Ida, you must not learn of me--the desolate and lonely'. I have no teachings for such as you, no motives pure enough for your ears. Life and alone will be my fate whatever name I bear, and it behooves tme to seek one suitable to my sad and stricken spirit; but I will assure you that there shall be no deception practised.'  With tearful eyes Ida gazed into her face. Some one passed by the window, and with a sad air she rose to leave the room, saying,- "Edith, I knew of this appointment. You warned me once; I will you ; and may I not, by remaining here, save you from committing a folly, as you once saved me from a worse? Say but the word; my   "FE AND ALONE.        95. presence will prevent all explanation; mamma shall never know it, and old Beresford is too proud ever to trouble you again."          ,i "Thanks, dear Ida; but you must leave us." As Mr. Beresford entered, Ida's retreating form seemed the light of some joy, extinct forever. And' now to Beresford's manly offer Edith made answer with all truth,-- "My respect and esteem you might possess; but they are cold words to live with. I have no love to give." "Miss Merton, if you have bestowed your heart upon no one else, and do not still cherish the memory of some past love, I can win your heart by my devo- tion."  "I cherish none, sir, for the living or dead." "Then I ask no more. Become my wife, and I am satisfied." "Be it so, Mr. Beresford; and if, in coming time, you find little sympathy, and see that your hope was error, remember I warned you of it. My heart is free, and grieves over no olden love; but stake not your hopes upon that.  Were an angel from Paradise by my side, moulded in all the virtues we women covet, he could not gain what I have not to give -a loving heart."  &#xD;<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC7083-00000198"/> 396       LIFE AND ALONE. The man she addressed felt convinced there was in him everything a woman should desire to love, and before their interview was ended, Edith had promised, at no distant day, to become his wife. One Sabbath day, as the family were at dinner, Ida broke out with,- "I declare, mamma, if our bishop does not provide another rector, his flock will fall into the grievous sin of idolatry. He is a constant visitor at Kate's, and Gerard is provoked that she should prefer church music to concerts." Edith Iboked up to see what Ida meant, and she knew by the deep blush overspreading her face, that this was a ruse to learn her mother's opinion of the talented and very elegant young rector, who seemed to have interested everybody. Lady Glenville was warm in his praise for fashion's sake.- The following morning Edith met Ida on the stairs, all equipped for walking, and "Where are you going?" burst invol- untarily from her lips. The arch smile and deep color with which Ida replied, - "Why, 'tis Lent," puzzled her exceedingly, and on Ida's return she met her again with a similar ques- tion, and the answer given was, - "Edith, do you suppose mamma would ever con- sent to my marrying a Christian unless he were a bishop?"   "FE AND ALONE.       397 The tone was more ridiculous than the question; but Edith replied gravely, - "You will have to change, Ida, before that event." "Yes, Edith; we all change, with much or little effort, and I take a different view of life from what I did formerly. I wish Clara Melville was alive. Do you know, Edith, that even you, in my present frame of mind, cannot help me? I am almost at a loss to discover how much my appreciation of a mail has to do with these changed views of life I now entertain. I do desire to have the same hope which made Clara Melville so willing to give up all that earth could offer, and die as peacefully." "What can you mean, Ida?" "I want to know how much Henry Ellis has to do with these feelings. He was at the Erskines' last night, and that induces mamma to invite him here to- morrow. She had better take care. Following the fashion sometimes leads to serious consequences. When with him I am half inclined to throw up the world, --life's bubble of pleasure, which must break sooner or later, - and win the jewel he tells of, price- less in value and eternal in lustre." "I cannot understand you, Ida; you talk enigmas." "We have changed characters, then, Edith. For years you were an enigma to everybody; but I fear  &#xD;<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7083-00000199"/> 398       LIFE AND ALONE. the little mystery enveloping me will go off like a morning mist." "Better thus, dear Ida; always stand out in the clear light of truth, and escape many dangers." Ida turned her brilliant eyes upon her, but remem- bering a promise made her mother, refrained from giv- ing a second warning. The ensuing evening, as Ida- had foretold, Henry Ellis, the young rector, was their guest. Edith did not wonder at the universal praise of him, and even Lady Glenville was alive to his grace and attraction. She saw how evidently he ad- mired Ida; but that was nothing strange; everybody did; and it was a compliment to herself; for was not Ida her own youth, lingering, as it were, by the side of an elder sister? To-night more than ever so; for Ida had laid aside all haughtiness of manner, and with a. pure spirit of gladness glided among the guests. She had said the truth- she was changed. Her re- solve was taken, and there was joy in heaven, because the beautiful of earth had turned aside, and sought out for herself the pure river of life flowing fast by the throne of God. Mr. Beresford found no opposi- tion to his wishes from Lady Glenville. She, in few words, expressed to him her high satisfaction in the connection for her niece, said something in praise of Edith, and assured him of Mr. Merton's consent.   "FE AND ALONE.       399 The matter-of-fact lovelr forthwith took himself to Middleton, and proved her words true. Mr. Merton gave to him a more cordial reception than to Roth- schild, and an unqualified consent to his daughter's engagement. Lady Blanche wished the marriage to take place at Glenville Castle, but to this Edith stren- uously objected. She would be married in her own home, and nowhere else; all who wished to be present at the event could repair to Middleton, and Lady Blanche could have no excuse for not being present at a marriage she had sanctioned; and, much as she disliked to do it, once more she must revisit a place filled with sad associations. After Mr. Beresford re- turned with Mr. Merton's consent, the engagement was made public, and Lady Blanche, observing Ida's extreme dejection, exclaimed, - "Don't keep on that long face, child; you make me nervous, and I see no occasion for this new phase of melancholy,. "Mamma, can you, will you, not prevent Edith's committing this mad folly? She does not, cannot, and never will, love old Beresford." "Your manner of speaking, Ida, is very improper. Do you suppose Edith is compelled to make the choice she has?" "Yes, mamma, I am sure circumstances have forced  &#xD;<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7083-00000200"/> 400       LIFE AND ALONE. her to it. Why can't you beg her to give him up, and assure her of your continued love- and protec- tion?" "Ida, I did tell you not to mention this subject to Edith again in the manner you are pleased to speak of it; but if I can convince you in no other way, carry your remarks, fears, and so forth, to her, and see what answer you will get." "It is of no use, mamma; her lips are sealed by this very pressure of circumstances; but you could save her from herself." "I have said and done nothing in this affair, and advise you to the same course." "Which advice I cannot follow, mamma. I have pleaded with you in vain. I will now go to Beres- ford, tell him all I do know, and ask if he thinks to make happy such a girl." Lady Blanche gazed a moment upon her daughter, and then, with a pallid cheek and quivering lip, ex- claimed, - "Go, and finish what your mother began." The words were hardly uttered before she fell in a swoon, and Ida had hard work to arouse her to con- sciousness. The poor girl felt that she must let things take their course, for there was some mystery she could not fathom, and a threatened evil her inter- ference might hasten.

"BUT it must take place, mamma," said Ida, as she knelt by her mother's side, and looked up fondly into her face; " this is duty, and Ellis's love quite another topic, with which to-day we have nought to do. ,My confirmation must take place. I know I am unworthy. Then it will serve as a chain to bind my heart within the precincts of its heaven-born hopes, an earnest to look beyond, instead of ever turning back upon the path I have trod and hope to quit forever. I must have the outward visible sign, or I dare not be sure of the invisible; and more still, mamma, the duty un- performed would steal the virtue from daily prayer. How dare I expect a blessing?"  "Ida, have you ever asked yourself how  far an earthly fancy leads you to this contemplated step?" "Ten thousand times, mamma; and now I know my motive is pure of that.

I do not even care to know your decision concerning him at present. I ask you about to-morrow, - a solemn day to me, - and I ask you to be present, mamma, and seek for yourself the blessing Heaven has vouchsafed your child.". "You are fickle and changeable, Ida, as the wind. Even to-morrow's act may be regretted; but do as you wish. It is useless to argue the matter." "And you and Edith will be present, mamma?" "Yes, yes; but leave me now." Lady Glenville mused a while, then exclaimed aloud, "How strange! how very different from what I had planned for her I " The golden rays of the departing day streamed through- the church windows; the twilight was suffi- cient, and no lights were burning upon the altar. The house was thronged; and yet but one person knelt at the chancel-a slight, graceful figure in the heyday of her youth and beauty. It seemed as if every curl, a drapery of rich profusion over her shoulders, had caught a sunbeam, and lay bathed in Heaven's own light, - a light which was breaking into her heart, - and thus early in life shining out her redemption.   "FE AND ALONE.       403 There were persons present who had often heard that same voice in gay song and laughter, now in clear re- sponse abdicating the world, and all its pomps and vanities. They saw the sacred sign of the cross marked on that youthful brow, wheik a coronet of diamonds had, often blazoned, and fe3%to witness a brighter lustre than ever jewel's sparkle made. How deep and earnest the interest with which the young girl listened to the urgings of divine love as pressed upon her by t}ie bishop I H6w clear the look with which she acknowledged all he said to be her desire to live! But once, as if some memory of the past swept across her soul, did her face lose something of its beauty, and wear the expression of a deep-felt pain. What it was God knows, but not man. Then the final benediction and the full peal of the organ re- called her to the new joy which ha^l brought down upon her head the seven-fold gifts of grace, and the power of the music was unto her soul an angel welcome to her name written in the Lamb's book of life. That congregation separated, all to their several homes. By a solemn act a young girl had spoken to them of death, of judgment, of heaven. There were many of them who would meet her Sabbath after Sabbath; there were others who would only recognize her face again  &#xD;<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7083-00000202"/> 40       ' LIFE AND ALONE. in the waiting hall of eternity; and that hour must prove if she well fulfilled her vow. Edith Merton had witnessed the scene; but, engrossed with other thoughts, it had made little impression upon her. She now returned to Middleton, and preparations for her wedding fast went on. Soon came the night before the cerermony. The spirit of reverie was upon her; but it was no silent hour. - Keen agony burst forth in expression. "Life and not alone! How dare I thus take des- tiny into my own hands, and try the future, without love? Yet it matters little whose name I bear - any but mine own. Marriage will' shield me from the world's pity, save me from its contempt. Why this new shrinking? Society will smile upon me, and call me happy. 'Tis the dying struggle of truth to live in my heart. Beresford knows not he is to wed the child of shame. Too late, too late!  Let these thoughts be dead in my breast. Why may I not in reality be the cold, commonplace person he deems me'? I know that the power of education, of self- culture, can crush these yearnings of love for some ideal. I have the strength within me to live an ordi- nary life. I may discipline myself to meet every duty. But, O, will there ever come moments when I shall   "FE AND ALONE.       405 feel I was capable of union with a nature endowed as my own I Forbid it, mighty God, and make me con- tent with the path I have chosen I Will I retract?

"Ida, I wonder if to-night will be one of those re- turns of something like beauty that Edith used to have at school," inquired Mrs. Gerard Melville, the Kitty Clover of the time referred to. "I don't know; I have not seen her since she was dressed," said Ida. "It was so much like her, Ida, refusing to have any bridesmaids.  Weren't you provoked?" "Not at all; she had very good reasons. But look;' here she comes." For once an expectant bride threaded her way be- tween a line of guests, and received not the usual half whisper, "I How beautiful she looks!"The rich dress, the veil, or the orange wreath, had failed to fling even a transient beauty over Edith Merton. She knelt with a listless air, her eye fixed on vacancy, her face as perfectly colorless as expressionless.

"Ida, Edith looks as she did the first morning she entered school, - not knowing what to do with her- self, - and scarcely older." "Hush! let us go forward, and relieve her embar- rassment., ' Edith was misread. She had merely bowed her head, a moment, to gather strength from her own thoughts, and now raised it gracefully, threw back her veil, and showed a face lit with beaming joy. A faint tinge of red was on each cheek, and her lips parted with that brilliant smile all powerful in its fas- cination. Her eye shone with an intense brilliancy, lighted from her intellect, - no glow from her heart. All drew near to wish her joy, and felt the cordial gratitude of her manner. Ida, only, pressed a kiss on the face of the strangely-changed bride, and shud- dered at the icy chill from her lips, as if they had suddenly grown white again from the cold at her heart. We leave Edith Merton upon the threshold of a new era of her life, -we have journeyed with her thus far, and at some futura will trace her life,--from to-day, from this her bridal hour. In Lady Glenville's mind every ambitious project faded away for her daughter at the time of her con-   "FE AND ALONE.       407 firmation. She had no desire for a love-sick maiden by her side, and gave her consent, gracefully, if not heartily, that Henry Ellis should become her son-in- law. There came at last an hour unto her when she blessed the choice Ida had made -the hour which cometh alike unto all, when earth fades away from * view, and eternity rolls its deep mysteries over the soul. -J  &#xD;<pb n="408-409 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7083-00000204"/> Is' -             ^ -   "ATE AND POPULAR BOOKS.
